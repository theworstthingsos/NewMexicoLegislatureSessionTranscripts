So.

All those in favor of the agenda
as amended.
It just does approved.
Go to correspondence thirty one
mins of course at this time Mr
chair members there's not any
correspondence.
Thank you so we'll move on then
to public comment item number
two on the agenda
Comment from.
Central because of.
Morning chair again good morning
committee members hi my name is
Jermaine Chicago and general
counsel for central consolidated
school district later on the
agenda you will hear from
operations director Candace
Thompson on an application
before you also have with us
today our
so not but assistant
superintendent Peter does would
our superintendent common
fortunately was on a family
vacation it's going to be here
for that previously scheduled
one we just wanted to give you
all a few updates and our
corners of the world are four
corners you should think of the
world
one of the is kind of an
alarming trend that we've seen
since plant closure are homeless
for students homeless streets
advocate around a hundred
hundred and fifty per year we're
we're right now it's three
seventy I'm not is growing every
week and we're concerned that
there are under reporting of
that because it is kind of a
difficult thing to report
families don't always talk about
it I'm so just wanted to.
Have the committee understand
that our board has been meeting
in this series of order treats
looking at cash balance we know
that we have a high cash
balances we have some reasons
for that
and also obviously the plant
closures for the small taxpayers
we do have in our district we
want to make sure that those
plant closures are hitting them
in in a way for five on debt
that increases taxes so what the
board is doing and and looking
at that cash balance and very
thankful obviously for that
the.
Impact aid dollars is is there
balancing the the huge historic
need to catch up on facilities
in our district as you guys know
we have I'm not just rolled
remote areas of our district
with the most to do for example
are very remote
and balancing that with thanks
on debt relief and on the board
As of a few weeks ago are
assistant superintendent also or
interim finance director so
we're looking at different ways
to make sure that resulted that.
Want to the inclusion what that
does also mean though is that it
puts a dent in our plans to
quickly as possible hi sure up
those historic kind of I have.
facility issues out.
So I don't think some of the
committee members are new so
probably haven't.
Issues particularly.
Just wanted to give you all
thanks.
In terms with like to come
before you and talk more about
that especially when it comes to
the need from office so that in
the notes to the facility said
we'll put will put it in that
one the other thing that I
wanted to talk about is is
obviously we all know that there
are extremely increased costs in
terms of construction by a
factor of at least three right
now is my understanding we also
have huge supply chain issues
and so on now kind of moving
into what the reason for some of
our our large on
cash balance in that what the
court is trying to do is to make
sure that it's very prudent and
how it spends that money so that
those dollars are stretched to
the.
Just as an example in New Mexico
and and I can this will know
this later and we'll give you
more info later but just as an
example we're looking at a two
year delay just from supply
chain Steinborn.
To electricity and power
infrastructure in the area.
So the last thing I want to
leave you all with is actually
something really exciting
It's exciting out of tragedy as
you all know we lost to
community members in a shooting
up in Farmington the last month
or so transaction two months now
because of that and some other
issues within our district and
other districts we have been
participating in our regional
Navajo Nation safety school fund
and school safety net we we had
our first one June twenty ninth
and thirtieth and it was very
successful I we had about a more
than a hundred and fifty folks
show up we did some training but
the biggest part of that was we
the second day we we broke off
into working groups to come up
with a draft action plan and
once that's completed we will
share that with you all and
other legislators as well as
Navajo Nation with that the goal
of really teasing out how we can
start approaching this from a
regional multi jurisdiction
level because it wasn't just New
Mexico and it was actually at a
carried over into the school and
so what we found very quickly as
we were not all of clips to
regionally communicate on a
state federal tribal level and
so we want to bring that to you
all because it is hugely
important where we want to try
to stave off you know something
happening state income or not
should be aware of the ideal
turnaround time or for law
enforcement.
And so we want to make sure that
we bring that for you all
especially from the safety
screen safety standpoint and
funding.
That you stand for questions if
you all have any but just wanted
to give you that to use our
quickness Mexico present thank
you for the update we appreciate
you bringing school refers to
consider yes Sir certainly take
a hundred I think you.
I wanted to the financial plan
at this time either.
Mr chair members.
I was a male are you face to
provide.
Checking in members good
morning.
There has been a lot of.
This financial plan passed on
month or so from the last PSUC
needing to special meeting
to today what we have is what
was approved and the
subcommittees but I will then
transition into some data that
is
the question for the council to
move forward in awarding
additional projects so let's go
ahead and start on page eight
executive summary of the out of
cycle projects that are have
affected the financial plan we
have a schedule and work package
we have copied done for the
reduction of the local match
waiver.
which was not approved so much
to.
A request for waiver for
construction funding.
out of cycle systems based
awards these were approved at
that is the committee.
increases lean middle school for
the construction phase funding
the engine eighty eight thousand
four seventy one that's crucis
value as well as to the
consequences Sierra elementary
school.
Here are some changes that
transplant transpired on the
financial plans from our last
meeting is Hobbes Heiser was
pushed out of quarter due to the
district awaiting some a result
of the feasibility study so
anything that moves between
quarters we note and I'm
active summary because that
affects the changes in the
financial planner also what was
added was the one point eight
million as well as the fourteen
dollar for Pignon elementary.
So that
let's move on over to page nine.
The top that is a reflection of
the decisions that were made for
the so most you elementary
sixteen hours
from the last piece using
meeting.
And the middle section that's
what's coming to you today as
far as the out of cycle awards
for last crucis tier C. will
schedule.
The last box you will see what
our fund balance is with an
explanation of what the changes
that occurred from the last two
years the piece yes you see
meeting hi we have nine hundred
and two million eight hundred
ninety nine thousand four ninety
two the change is a reflection
of the seven point five million
that was allocated to PED dean
as well as the old bonds that
were written off at the council
approved.
During the bond reconciliation
project and then there was.
Five million dollars in draws so
before we move on any further if
you have any questions regarding
this page with the previous
pages.
Questions at this point.
You have any questions.
All right let's move on to page
ten.
The.
Main change that was added to
this financial plan right now we
need GSD solvency appropriation
have two hundred thousand in the
uses.
As you can see on this financial
plan.
It's estimated uncommitted
balance money thirty three.
As of the for it shows seventy
four point nine million.
this is where I am going to kind
of transition into the work that
has been done on this financial
plan are would you be able to
pass out the.
Hi handles.
There's been concern on whether
or not there is going to be
adequate funding to provide not
only Los Alamos but also any
projects coming forward
in regards to the Senate bill
one thirty one and any potential
waivers.
So we've been working very
diligently now on this financial
plan now that the bond
reconciliation project is
complete and working with a few
different people to help us
really hone in on on the
financial plan as well as gain
clarity.
As you see on your hand out.
Because we have a large agenda
and it and we have been working
with the chairs to be able to
then.
Have a work session for the
subcommittees and can dive
deeper into a financial planner
so that the high level and so
you will probably have questions
and we will get into those at a
later time all of this
Handout is to.
Get the council to feel
comfortable knowing that there
is adequate funding to continue
to fund these projects that are
coming forward as well as
potential waivers okay so let's
take a look at.
Page two of your hand.
It's.
Go down to item thirty three.
In the blue.
As it is and this to me.
You see a significant change.
The reason for that is in the
past and and you're on your
current financial plan.
What's been Representative on
here are the bond sales.
When we go out for a moment
excuse me try to sell bonds.
We work with more to go with
forty finance and we look at our
list alright thank you have a
hundred fifty hundred seventy
five and we look at one of the
potential appointees into.
Add that to the list of the
certification in order to sell
bonds keep in mind these
districts have not come.
Two PS that they yet for funding
these are potential these are on
the list and so we're putting
them on the list so that we can
send.
On your current financial plan
date those projects are on the
financial plan has committed.
They.
Are not.
So what we have done is we've
taken those those projects off
of the financial plan to go back
on to the financial plan when
they come to you for approval.
So we have these projects to
sell bonds once they are
The bonds are sold them he's
taken off of the financial plan
and then we assign every time
they come to you for free.
I don't look forward until you
do you have any questions.
I think that the your
explanation of the process to.
It's also very of.
Positive in terms of the future
of the future funding
availability for project.
Making that clear are there any.
Thank you Mr chair could you
explain why.
There sixty million moving from
fiscal year twenty three to
twenty four.
Yes
Can you refer to where you're
looking at L. online thirty one
there's.
Under fiscal year twenty three
one hundred eighty seven point
five million.
Binders it's two hundred forty
seven.
Five million just wanted money
that was made to the school year
twenty four.
I'm checking in members that was
a lot of movement within the
cell most so there's some items
on here that were put on a
financial plan prior to them not
be approved so there's a lot of
movement like I mentioned at the
beginning once this meeting is
done what it will be able to
clarify what is actually being
awarded.
Quest and one more if I could
follow up on that Mr chair thank
you could you tell me a little
bit more about.
I guess what we're anticipating
or awards or request for war.
How much the waiver of that
would be in those request.
Mister chair Mister New.
What we're expecting or
currently would would miss
Rommel's presents the
applications received there's
about twenty two.
And we did an exercise that if
each and every one of these
twenty two projects
That qualified for waiver
understanding is still the
decision of the PCS the if they
are looking for for a hundred
percent
the total amount would be about
four hundred and twenty six
point four million.
We anticipate.
I'm just.
Madam chair members I mean Mr
chair members we would
anticipate about fifteen of them
coming forward but I do want to
comment on that four hundred
twenty six point four million
that's before we do our due
diligence before we understand
the project this is just an
extreme worst case scenario.
You indicated that
The amount of money that would
be available for waivers but I
want to assure everyone that the
the money for the actual project
the phase one and phase two
construction is also set aside
and if you're marked at that
point I.
Mr chair members you're correct
and that's reflected in the
line.
That amount of money thirty one
includes is worded phase one and
phase to satisfy.
Thank you we've never seen as
many requests for waivers as are
coming forward.
Careful to make sure we don't
set any precedent that.
Can't.
Consistent with.
And so very.
At the end of the previous that
Report of the flex.
Mr Chairman questions so Mr
chair but we've talked at
previous meetings about well the
council really us PS that fade
to look at ways we can
pull down the costs of the
trends that were seen in the
cost of construction.
The only nationally.
We
that perhaps there's some
different approaches to
procurement I can help was
pulled down
those costs my question is is P.
SFA looking at some
opportunities there and if so it
would be good at some point to
here what your thoughts are on.
Mister chair Mister the act
thank you for that question it
is going to be an item at the
August EMS Committee meeting we
there's a lot of safeguards that
you as a committee have put in
place already we have a gross
square footage limit that we can
participate in we have
educational spaces that we
participate in Albany and
If the school.
Exceeds those go script but ages
are at other things the crosses
on them so what we can control
our size and spaces.
And we rely heavily on our
project managers we have many
years of experience on how to
keep the project within budget
the things that are beyond our
control the current client of
the economy and the the wait for
the quickness and the labor
shortage but the other things we
scrutinized very carefully
House.
So Mr chairman again I'm I'm and
I'm really looking for and I
know we were going to look at
this and and then I'm really
happy that that we're trying to
be proactive and and my hope is
through whatever sort of
strategies that we can identify
we can help manage those
construction costs and projects
so that we're able to fund as
much as we possibly can because
we have so much needed in the
state.
Mr chairman yes thank you.
The other questions.
The the.
And.
Look at the national.

Mr chairman members good morning
this item is to inform you of
the appropriation letter of
intents that we received since
the last yes the is the meeting
in June we received the
application from Cuba for
prekindergarten classrooms to up
to upgrade their existing
prekindergarten classrooms at
Cuba elementary school and
you'll be hearing from the
district that the this is the of
the meeting further district
presentation on both of those
That was before the
subcommittees since the
subcommittees couple weeks ago
I've also received several
application others that you'll
see next month but I will vote
for me to receive them from one
from Senator from for standards
based project as well as the
systems based project.
One protect the clover systems
based in west Las Vegas for
system phase and one from house
for teacher housing so you'll
see those for next month just to
let you know I do expects
Senator letters of intent for
applications in the upcoming
months now that July first
passed in the Senate bill one
thirty one is now in effect a
big several districts that we're
waiting for that to submit their
application so we'll be gearing
up to receive more in the
upcoming weeks.
That is for I'm sorry.
That.
Page sixty eight there is the
table showing all of the
pre application receive.

The potential for.
On page sixty nine
this table shown.
Showing
As well as the districts that
have already applied for
standards based some expected
standards based applications
that we're expecting to receive
soon
As well as the PS that these
estimates for these potential
project.
Following rate in page seventy
and seventy one is the letter
from Cuba that is.
Thank you.
Through the.
Whether any questions on the.
This.
Education.
Sure.
Thank you a question of.
As we move to this kind of on
ongoing application process said
he noticed any trends.
This.
Four quarts and do you
anticipate now that you've
listed up about four other
districts coming forward how
many more applications you might
get before the end of twenty
four.
Mr chair and Mr Liu.
This year has been on in unique
due to the fact that we have
just the one thirty one point of
changing the game
most of the districts that are
on these lists that have already
applied half of them applied
last year and were unable to
move forward receive due to
their financial issues with the
funding passing we're waiting
for November for many of these
to go up on.
the other half of these.
That did apply already they kind
of called the head we had
discussions with them so that
they were aware they could apply
before July first.
What I'm expecting in the
upcoming months or those
districts that haven't
necessarily called to discuss
potential applications so it's
kind of a big question mark and
an unknown at this point that's
why this was the potential
applications which includes miss
the best up tackles Rutan in Rio
Rancho builder the districts
that have expressed interest.
other than those I'm not really
sure.
I do expect us I'm hoping that
these districts will.
Apply soon we also have many
districts that are waiting to
see what happens with our bond
we might see more in following
November.
so unfortunately I don't have a
definitive answer for you
But I I do first the many
applications and many more
request for local introductions.
Because of what we're seeing
that the trend is that these
districts don't have enough
bonding capacity to be able
screen replacement for persons
who are playing currently.
And just one more question Mr
chair are there any districts
that you know of that have.
See a large high school or the
big project that they may not be
able to come up with a match for
that we'll be approaching us and
Mr chair and members you'll hear
from some of them today Maxwell
for the full screen replacement
K. twelve spring wealth
Techsters got a couple large
schools.
We also have a new look at the
list Hagerman the combined K.
twelve that will be coming
forward
COVID high school.
hello a lot of these are either
combined schools for the entire
district
and what we're seeing are these
are schools that were built.
Many buildings over time that
have have to pass the functional
lifespan and it's it's time for
them to be replaced
and it it makes more logical and
efficiencies that's to replace
all of it at once so those are
going to be those large dollar
now projects that we're seeing
come forward
It in response yes there are
many times sorry Mr chair for
that just one one.
How many how many functional and
that's a lot of projects coming
up once.
We have enough workforce tales
to pull this out.
Help how many projects can we
need to radically actually
complete.
The this period of time is a
huge demand.
Mister chair Mister do we have
been thinking about that in
house right now we have about
two hundred seventy active
projects and we have I believe
fifteen have ten managers so as
we move forward
Preparing a budget for next year
when looking at funding need
staffing we're probably going to
make a request to increase the
number of staffing so that we
can manage these projects.
Based on what we currently have
and what we're expecting to come
forward.
Mr chair.
It's going.
To get just to follow up on that
Mr Lee said I think that
question about workforce is not
just about his the staff it's
about workforce in general in
terms of the the impact
at the bility for the
construction workforce to handle
the increase in the number.
So Mr chair.
I miss Warniment.
I don't I my **** Mr Bailey his
thoughts on that I can't at this
moment answer what the
construction industry might look
at but what I what I've heard
without.
No one actually is that there's
a lot of work and the
surrounding states there's a lot
of work here and that prices are
going up and I am hoping to
learn something at the task
force we have an economist
present.
Maybe wants to add anything.
With meeting the challenges you
want shortens hi it does more to
constructions Newark however
respective businesses operate
the Downing Street.
What are you on the internet
because workforce in our that we
can inspect.
All you know they start the
project using the sort of on the
text they they give sign on
bonuses.
All right to your solution
shortages I don't see that
changing top quick.
More supply out there the use of
force so some of the issues that
point to retire I think that you
would expect to get rich.
Chairman
of that so it's a challenge and
it's going to be.
I think that's part of the
reason the cost of right you
don't need people like it
because our which is at the time
of special.
The regional that's challenge on
to creation going to keep faced
prepared time hopefully we we
change and get young folks
coming in what are the trade
the.
That are not.
Or thank you.
The other questions.
Let's go ahead and move on to
the.
Presentation is themselves.
We have.
Let us know how but the.
Receive.
Yes Sir.
Yes Sir Mr chairman members on
page seventy two I do have an
executive summary additional
walking through what's happening
today with the additional
information
as you know the application was
released in January and this
remains open all year and just
the one thirty one is going to
affect the financial situation
of the local match as well as
the office related.
This your eligibility for the
standard is that at the top line
seventy five with within the
ranking for an FBI greater than
seventy percent the eligibility
of the school is determined by
the ranking at the time of
application prekindergarten all
school facilities would
prekindergarten programs and for
the pilot teacher housing is
that there are no available
housing within ten miles from
the school Sir.
the standards based applications
that we received and reviewed
and that are ready to present
today are the following central.
Next we'll bring your indexer
which are listed there postponed
implications which we will here
at potentially future issues the
meetings are penny also
we'll go right Hagaman Hobbs
said that in two years and we
have yet to review Cobray which
were will be planning to do with
the next few weeks.
prekindergarten we were going to
hear from to be today but they
are unable to attend to the
change of schedule and we'll
also be hearing Sapporo at a
future meeting for teacher
housing we're ready to proceed
with the actual and again to
will be postponed till next
month and we're not ready to
proceed with a as of yet.
So.
Essentially.
January through July will
one collecting these
applications.
For today will be hearing the
district presentations with our
districts and at the August
meeting you maybe make the
potential ways for these four
districts.
and then at the August through
December meetings you also hear
additional district as of
districts become ready to
present.
The following sections for each
district.
Districts have The presentation
that they developed for you and
that they will go over.
With you today.
That their application formally
to you.
Following their application or
maybe some additional support
documents.
But toward the end or the piece
of fate Reports these are
abbreviated report says from
what we present we will be
presenting the full report for
the recommendation and all of
the details in terms of the
estimated cost and finances at
the meeting it was very
difficult to make those
financial estimates that before
we knew with the local match
reductions would be now that we
have those we continue forward
in the districts will also be
submitting their final
applications within the next
week.
so it is really for you to hear
from the district and asked the
district questions I'm here
today to support but but really
I'd like for the districts to be
making the presentation to use
so that you understand what
they're asking for.
So checking in.
Have a district go first in the
state to follow up if you in
this you thank you in order to.
Mr chair members the first
district on the list is health I
will move then asked him to come

to support the housing and any
new structures on this property.
So you can kind of see
conceptual we when we were
designing for the subdivision we
put a lot of for talking and if
we needed to move on a school
down here we laid it out on this
property to make sure that we
have acreage available to us and
the infrastructure in place to
support so we have done a lot of
the foot work early on.
During the additional teacher
housing.
the middle school will be
developed for grades seven and
eight.
As we will be moving are sixth
graders back into our elementary
funding.
As I said earlier the site is
developed with with
infrastructure supports twenty
teachers you're not.
Would you like me to continue
with that our housing the pilot
housing project or do you have
some questions you would ask on
the middle school before we I.
You can take all the questions
at the perfect
the teacher housing pilot
project again it of the SCO the
central office site.
We have five hundred units in
place right now we are asking
for for an additional I think
that all the infrastructure is
to the property
what we will be asking for is
the construction of the homes
themselves it will be two and
three bedroom units are three
bedroom units are one thousand
three hundred and fifty four
square feet and are two bedroom
units are a thousand fifty two
square feet.
We've attached some photos on
page eighty four
this is our mesa heights project
that we started the design
during the COVID and twenty
twenty on April of twenty twenty
one we help the ground breaking
ceremony for both the sites at
mesa and central office housing
and bills
Fourteen houses and sixteen
months from design to teachers
talking behind the houses it
took us sixteen months.
So we had a great contractor a
great architect group and we're
able to get these homes Phelps
quickly.
they are standalone units they
offer ample space and privacy it
makes them a perfect fit our
educators value their personal
space and need a choir
Environment to work.
our buildings higher tides both
function and comfort ensuring
that teachers have everything
they need to feel at home what
are you with our units educators
can focus on what they do best
teaching and shaping the minds
of the next generation as I said
on page eighty eight we have two
locations.
Hi with a total of fourteen
houses.
We are four three bedroom units
two bedroom units.
At central office next to our
administration office we have
five units total.
Two three bedroom units and
three two bedroom units.
the interior additionally we
have large windows.
Your stories in the living and
dining room to provide ample
natural light
Thank you for the beautiful view
and surrounding with landscape
comfortable seating options
propose the amendment Beyonce
make it perfect for a place to
spend time with loved ones on
page on ninety one you will see
the interior of the home
additional finance and every
every.
With that the staff for
questions like to think the
committee for hearing us this
morning.
Thank you for your presentation.
The question council members.
Mr chair and do you want to
commend you on your good
maintenance practices good to
know that your main buildings
well.
we're we're gonna be talking
about teacher housing updates
later kind of curious what
percent of your district is
tribal.
Chair Mister Liu our districts
that as you know about ninety
percent on the Navajo
reservation current one is the
only sites where there's housing
available on a free market.
My second question Mr chair if I
might ask and I'm gonna ask this
for all the presenters do you
have a cost per.
Mister chair Mister Liu that is
a moving target.
We did some at
two PS that they are costs which
I I don't think that cost is
good right now so for me to be
able to give you a cost per
square foot.
I I would probably be lying to
you because that's not what it's
going to be when we go out to
bid.
Mr chairman members of if I may
as a as I just said in the next
few weeks we'll be working with
each district individually to
fill out that final application
and will be really honing in on
a reasonable cost per square
foot for you time right now for
any of these applications we've
estimated four eighty square
foot
just as a ballpark however the
next two weeks now that we have
just the one thirty one action
will be finalizing these numbers
and this will have the.
Final final numbers especially
for the phase one.
Of funding for planning is.
Chair I could follow up on that
so about four eighty for each of
these projects is the staff
estimates are there any.
Adjustments for their rule or
tribal areas that estimate.
But for central Mr chair and
members
Yes.
however sensual has had several
current projects going on right
now so unlike other districts
that have haven't done a
construction project in many
many many decades Senator has a
better handle on costs right now
especially with the housing
they're one of the model
districts that have successfully
constructed teacher housing
units over the last few years
we see music or housing units
multiple times for the past
couple of years they're
beautiful and and she's really
done a great job refining that
the housing developments and
processes construction so please
we stand by but you Candice's
numbers
and that in the next few weeks
again I think we'll be
renegotiating just to make sure
that we feel comfortable with
the numbers and she goes from
our estimate and.
The order number for August.
Mr chair.
I will if I may add one thing to
this Thompson's presentation
part of the middle school
projects would also be to
include twelve teacher housing
so essentially she's asking for
for teacher housing units
through the housing program so
that those start sooner.
And then the twelve units will
be to replace some of those
teacher housing units that they
will be decommissioning once the
middle school.
And that will get closer to the
what with the twenty nine
teacher housing units in that
development yes I the need for
more with the housing program
and then twelve hopefully with
this standards based project.
Thank you if I may chairman Mr
Liu and in this division that
we've developed like I said we
have already brought in all the
infrastructure to the loss on
the twenty nine months what we
will be
having to add it is as you heard
our council earlier speak
towards
the ways and transformers that
that's what is hurting us right
now is just to wait in
transformers due to the current
economic impact that they're
having on this but the four
units that I'm asking for in the
pilot project we do have that
transformer already on site so
there will be no delay and and
the transformer for the four
houses that we're asking for.
Mr Chairman thank you Mr the
group was to the if you do a
fabulous job
thank you very helpful your
leadership there.
Appropriations and I you
actually kind answered just some
of my questions about the
teacher housing a little more I
thought it was remarkable that
ninety eight because positions
for fifteen to twenty two
percent
and so I wanted to know a little
bit more about the development
town that supports
the area in terms of of Shiprock
and or other areas other areas
where the disease might be
impacted you more.
Mr chair one moment it's our and
Mr does what can also speak to
the our vacancies are mainly on
the reservation
and.
When we don't have housing we
lose out on the I'm just
teachers coming to our area I
have a waiting list that grows
every day
I think my last.
Your presentation you said that
there's four hundred and twelve
students but then you said that
your sixth graders will be
relocated to your elementary
school so how many seventh and
eighth grade students will be
served by the school.
Mr chair we are.
I don't have that exact number
for you right now when we
submitted that our board have
not yet made the decision to
move districts graders down so I
don't have not broken out
I'm thinking that's probably in
the neighborhood of.
Two eighty four.
Mr chairman members that's the
five year projection for the
FMP.
Thank you Mr chairman.
I have a follow up so I'm
assuming that these housing
units will serve more than just
the middle schools these are
teachers and so I just want to
mention that in your app.
The only reference to four
hundred and twelve students but
I would imagine that that number
is much larger because this is
not just for the.
I just wanted to point.
Questions.
Have a couple of questions of
first on the screen proportion
of.
The district own the property
the new property to to be
locating this school on.
Mr chair yes we do we do have a
lease on the property that we
are moving from middle school to
okay hello is that these
I would have to go back and look
at updates but I believe yes
squeeze and tall when.
Twenty forty five nineteen.
I'll have to verify that
to take a look at that I think
is a standard twenty five.
We have members that fifty years
Jesus our staff with or twenty
five with an option to renew for
twenty five.
Transaction.
Sure.
this place does have a fifty
year lease it's in the beginning
of this please and it does have
a hearing bill provision you.
The next.
It's a it's a locked.
Thank you.
the other question is what will
happen with the.
Of all school.
Mr chair we will in the future
to see how many teachers as you
have a.
Mr chair we will demo on the
screen and
Houses there's a few of the.
Duplexes and not that are also
starting to show structural
issues faced that they were
built during the same time as
the middle school was
constructed so we would also
demo those units.
And how of how close is the new
site he said it's next to the
administration building yes so
how close is that the new site
to the existence that although
it.
Would serve the same students
yes yes it'll it'll serve the
same students it's less than
five miles.
All right then of the questions
on the future just.
Indicated that.
One set of the teacher just
would be at the ministration
building as well.
so
of those open to administrators
as for just teachers are Mr
chair teachers take preference
there are a few administrators
there's one home in this
particular subdivision that is
the superintendents on.
That currently remains empty.
Because it's the superintendents
from
but teachers take preference
over administration.
do you have administrators in
the other office we do have our
new finance director.
Is in a home.
And.
Our principal a new principal is
that a home also.
So we do have a few
administration and
principles that reside in our
homes.
and I don't know if we have.
With the assistance from the
council if that would be limited
to teachers or not I'm not sure
what language.
It might take a look at that.
She can members is currently.
Right and then the city.
So the players.
As well as.
Thank you thank you thank you
for your continued support of
our districts we appreciate it
yeah.
Mr chairman members if you're
ready.
Next we have Mexico municipal
schools.
Who has applied for standards
based application to replace the
if you're twelve school with the
two additional teacher housing
units and how introduce miss the
rules for tenants you can
achieve.
Earning Mr chair members with me
okay I have our board president
hearing the current.
And we did also bring our
business manager Robinson with
just in case you have any
questions on the finances that
we can't answer.
I'm if you'll turn to page one
of seven in your packets I'll
kind of walk you through our
power point presentation and if
there's anywhere you would like
me to expand or any other item
you have we stand for those as
well.
We are asking for a standards
based award on page one of nine
the last time we came before you
and requested funding was for
some security improvements we
have completed that project it
did come in on time and on
budget that was to add a fob
system to all of our exterior
doors and also to replace some
of our exterior full glass doors
with steel doors to prevent
intrusion that project has been
completed six.
Last year we did our master
plans and at that time when we
began the master plan process
our combined school was ranked
around one twenty on the state's
list after completing our master
plan process and our site
assessments we have moved up to
number seventeen on the state's
list originally we had looked at
replacing two buildings our
admin building in our high
school building but again as we
did those assessments and looked
at life span of buildings and
some of the current issues in
those buildings in the cost to
remediate those issues we are
here before you today requesting
a full screen replacements.
On page one eleven we have our
map of the current grounds we do
currently have five buildings
the high school is up towards
the top the gem and cafeteria
does service all students K.
twelve next to that is our admin
building that does share space
with a school nurse that
services all students K. twelve
next to that is elementary and
then a middle school building.
In the middle there were you see
kind of a blue it almost looks
like a swimming pool shape that
is our school playground for the
schools we do not have any green
field space for our students and
we are the only district in the
area that does not have a track
currently are tracking cross
country students are running
through the streets of town that
do not have sidewalks for
practice and a long state road
five oh five as well and the
speed limit on that road is
sixty miles per hour.
We currently cannot fence our
campus as it sits right now
there is a main street that runs
right between the high school
there and the other buildings so
in terms of walking down a
campus during a campus we
currently are not able to do
that and currently we cannot
even fully fenced in where our
playground is and we have had
strangers you know who come off
twenty five come into town are
looking for things and walk
right out onto our playground
while we have kids in the
background as well.
So.
Right now the way that our
campus that's we have some some
major safety concerns.
Page one twelve these are
pictures from our high school
building the building was built
in nineteen fifty nine with some
additions in nineteen eighty two
currently the floor is thinking
you can see there we we actually
put our really there's you can
see exactly how far thank you.
we do not have air conditioning
in that building currently the
temperatures in northern New
Mexico are rising last week we
had in the nineties there's no
air conditioning in that
building so we did you some of
our air quality money to put in
window AC units but right now we
are able to look at really
adding instructional days to our
calendar because I can't put
kids in those rooms when it's
ninety five degrees outside.
We did have a boiler system that
is very antiquated and it
happened to go out for five
weeks this winter our
temperature in the classrooms is
fifty degrees we were able to
retrofit that and get some
additional parts to get it
running I don't know how long
it's going to continue to work.
And our bathrooms are not ADA
compliant.
The next building is our middle
school building this is one of
our newer buildings it was built
in two thousand and one as you
can see in the pictures there we
do have foundation walls that
are cracking walls that are
separating at bottom right
picture there is some mold that
is growing on the inside of our
school auditorium and again
there is no air conditioning in
this.
Next page is our elementary
school building this home was
built in nineteen eighty two
and it does have some black mold
along the exterior northern
facing side of the building as
well as some foundation cracking
going down the middle of the
hallways in the classrooms.
The gentleman cafeteria was
built in nineteen eighty two the
way that this one it's almost
like in many kids so you enter
from the top level and then you
go down into where the actual
floor sets and we do have water
that is seeping through our
concrete floors at that level we
originally tried to remediate
that we thought maybe it was
leaking along foundation and
seeping along the walls it is
actually coming through the
walls
Our bathrooms are not adequate
for the building capacity that
picture there in the middle that
is the bathroom in that building
for the men.
And the stalls are not
appropriate heights for the
elementary children who are
using those restrooms during P.
E. and for the cafeteria's well
this this building again does
house both the gym facilities
and the cafeteria facilities for
the entire district.
The locker rooms are also below
the top level below ground level
that's our bottom left picture
there that's the water that's
actually seeping it into one
corner those locker rooms do not
have adequate ventilation.
our cafeteria does not have any
walk in freezers so we currently
have standalone fridges and
freezers and unfortunately due
to the way that the building was
laid out those fridges and
freezers or directly under the
heating elements that sheet that
facility and our on top of the
air vents so that's.
Compounding our relation issues.
We do not have a dry storage
the ability to control the
temperature in our dry storage
area for our food and we do not
have a office space for
cafeteria staff.
The exterior doors also do not
meet fire code and are not ADA
compliant.
The next page the next building
this is our admin building this
one was actually a WPA project
back in the nineteen thirties
unfortunately it's structure is
crumbling that bottom right
picture there I affectionately
call that my G. getting
the the bricks are falling out
there's some black mold in the
basement Water also seeping
through those concrete walls the
plumbing is failing
and the foundation is settling
which is causing flooring issues
on the main floor our windows
also no longer function and and
do not feel so we have literally
snow coming into the building in
the winter.
We do currently on to teacher
just I'll be very honest and up
front with you one is currently
occupied by myself as the
superintendent the other is
currently occupied by our
principal we do have additional
lots that we would like to put
teacher houses on we are going
to be requesting to
this year we actually lost our
only secondary math teacher due
to housing she had been renting
in retirement which is about
twenty five minute drive
her landlord sold the property
she couldn't find anywhere else
to live and she has moved back
to Albuquerque I currently do
not have a secondary math
teacher I have not been able to
recruit anybody due to lack of
housing.
Again we do already own lots
that we would like to put those
on
We just need that housing and.
On page one eighteen I did
include some excerpts from our
facilities master plan again are
combined school is number
seventeen currently on the last
Many of our issues that we
currently have our life and
safety issues.
S. issues ventilation issues
mold issues access issues
and our fire systems are not up
to code we do not have a dialer
that is able to go on our fire
system because of the age of
that fire panel so if the fire
alarms go off
no with Ortiz are notified.
Our enrollment history Mexico is
a very small community we are
very rural that we have
maintained a stable enrollment
over the years and see that
continuing we do have a few
businesses that have come back
into the area and some families
that are moving into town with
younger children.
It is late we really had an
aging population and we had a
little bit of a deep there but
that starting to turn and go
back up in terms of our
enrollment numbers.
So are propose projects Edgell
we are requesting a planning and
design award for fiscal year
twenty four and hopefully with
the construction award then for
fiscal year twenty five.
The construction will need to be
completed in phases we do plan
on putting that on the existing
site all on one side of the
streets
so we know that will need to
demolish probably one building
to start with and start
construction on that site and we
do have the ability to move
things around within our
existing buildings to be able to
accommodate that so our
community does understand that
we're looking at probably five
years total from start to finish
our community is fully behind us
we did.
Find on page one twenty one are
estimated cost and we did
include your square footage
there
we did but in the Mexico maximum
allowable construction costs of
five hundred per square foot for
the new building we did include
the demolition costs at fifteen
dollars per square foot and
included some soft costs there
in case there's you know utility
issues or that sort of thing we
did includes construction of to
teach regions at that four
hundred thousand dollar per
teacher age estimate number
and then we will also require
some miscellaneous items fruit
mince including you know parking
lots playgrounds greenfields
that sort of things that we did
include that estimated cost as
well to try not to come back and
ask you for additional money
down the road we really try to
include everything up front.
And on the back page we just
wanted to review with you our
financial situation Maxwell did
not come before you and so we
had all of our ducks in a row we
did a special mail in election
in may our community approved
our bonds two hundred percent
capacity and they approve that
was seventy percent voting in
favor of at the Sanchez we do
have plans to sell our bonds in
September.
We are going to have to request
a waiver because even at a
hundred percent long capacity
Maxwell Fund is only one point
one million dollars so we are
bonded to that full capacity.
We have worked diligently to be
good stewards of the public
funds we previously had been on
supplemental funds we have
exited that successfully and our
audit findings the last two
years we had in twenty one
twenty two.
We had three non compliance
funding thank findings excuse me
and fiscal year twenty two we
had zero findings and of course
this year is still under review.
With that we stand for any
question.
Thank you Mr chairman
compensated for your
presentation in light of all the
life and safety issues you for
that how long it would take to
get this.
Off the ground it plans in case
any of the areas.
Cannot be used yes currently we
actually are pretty far I are
square footage for our in the
moment so we can for example
that the building honestly in
the worst shape is the admin
building that was built in
nineteen thirty nine if we
needed to move everybody out of
there and re locate we could
make that work we do have a few
multi use spaces that we could
do our elementary classrooms are
very large and if we had to put
up a divider and she's you know
split those we could also do
that but we do have plans to be
able to relocate people ask
varies areas about.
Thank you yes Sir.
Mr chair at follow up to that
point I didn't see like you're
facing so which building are you
going to build verses that
you're administrative things
that we use that we haven't gone
to design but our our thought is
that we would do kind of a
combined building with
everything attached
Mr chairman members that'll have
to be determined that the design
phase with our state
Representative feasibility is.
Where this team would be best
located what school building
existing building could be
moved.
Buildings are very concerning
and the safety issues are very
concerning
and I just want to say I
appreciate that you all do the
work to make sure you are fully
bonded and.
Is it just a couple of questions
one of the sort of been
addressed but one of my
questions we will design be able
to accommodate that street that
runs through the property and
not to ensure that either
students are having a crossover
maybe but actually the ministry
was diverted somehow
But
definitely not conducive so that
was our original question I
think that was just answered
Will the two teeth which is
additional teachers be
sufficient for you
and then I noticed that in the
two existing as a superintendent
in another and then I will
those.
And then my final question is if
you could.
That get a little bit more
information on the supplemental
funds check so Mr chair members
the current teacher **** in
years past when.
Those teachers have not been
needed for either teachers or
staff the district has actually
rented them out to community
members who might need them just
to make sure that those are not
sitting vacant for any reason a
lot of our teachers do actually
come from the area in their
families have been in the area
for many many years originally
we thought about coming before
you and asking for for teacher
just but we did end up feeling
that back I think the two will
be sufficient to and those two
will be for teachers
It's difficult to get
administrators and rural areas
as well
so we would like to reserve that
right to be able to put our our
Senate administrative into some
of that housing but these two
new teachers as what a hundred
percent be committed to.
And supplemental funds to do I
just wasn't sure what that up.
So you could just elaborate.
Is anyone I respond to that one.
Susan Robinson as our business
manager.
Our.
Smaller communities and our
state in Orleans but we have had
to rely on what is going regions
is not little funds being
artistic doesn't generate and
copy in need to cover the cost
operator is here
I've been in this different I do
not years.
Having forced sixteen or
seventeen it is usually not.
well here are as much as six
hundred twenty thousand dollars
to operate.
However in the last two years we
have not required does
additional funds thank you thank
you.
Questions.
Thank you Mr chair for stuff
congratulations on getting your
community on board with this I'm
kind of curious.
But the combined project are you
looking to reduce your square
footage from the original design
and if so by how much yes Sir we
would follow that the expected
fireman's for square footage for
students so right now we know
that we have the luxury of
having a very large space for
our enrollment so we do
understand that we're gonna be
reducing that square footage and
will be under the expect
require.
Thank you and Mister chair if I
could also ask how did you get
your community to create to.
That consolidation approach
what's yours.
Lou our community has never
failed to pass on any time or
schools asked for it they are
incredibly supportive of our
students in our at our school
because they realize that
without school we don't have a
community
so it really I mean we went out
and push the idea
are submitted an excellent job
of it.
Forming the community and also
informing them of our need and
showing them exactly what we
show to in the problems that we
face
so it it really was not a hard
task.
Thank you Mr.
It was through you took my
question also this is current.
The state.
How are you doing about you'll
get a six point four.
But you've always been
successful how long have you
been on the board.
I think you know the.
During my twenty first year.
So thank you for your service
we've always been very.
Act is the very.
Children first so
get a citrus.
Only have one the serve a
question mark and that was
on the administrative portion of
the of the facility I'll be fine
is locally as soon and those
would be those costs would be
broken up.
Mr chairman and members yes
again that that will be
determined during the design
phase how much space they have.
Administration building that
they're a very very small
district they don't need a lot
of administrative to stay
sitting right now that they have
a whole building that that could
easily fit into a larger screen.
The superintendent wears many
hats that.
That's all I had in the
beginning of next I have one
more question I'm sorry thank
you Mr chair it's actually from
is from so as we see a move
towards these consolidated K.
twelve campuses are pre K.
twelve campuses.
Can you talk about the types of
efficiency cost efficiencies we
should expect not only in
construction but just general
operation of the facility at Mr
chair and members missed that
this is a perfect example of a
school right sizing itself
through a potential replacement
screen right now they are at
the.
Fifty six thousand square feet
gross profit for their whole
campus
they only have a hundred
seventeen students projected.
So we.
That number into the our maximum
allowable calculator it results
in thirty thousand which is
about twenty five thousand.
Under what they currently have
however this is a micro district
and what we realize recently was
that works several similar
projects that are currently
going on with these mega
districts are calculator doesn't
necessarily.
let these micro districts in
that calculator now so we're
gonna have to work with the
district during the design phase
to determine a reasonable
prospect but it's numbers of
that school can actually
option
and so.
By right sizing schools like Max
one other districts that are
shrinking the rostrum finish it
will save them over time and
maintenance and operations
heating cooling on tire facility
districts this small typically
have.
They need.
The issue in the school so it
will save them maybe it's not
iterations over time by just
having a smaller footprint
and as far as efficiency for
construction plastic and the
Strickler Mister parks in.
Another factor for districts
such as Maxwell in the spring
coming up are these are pretty
rural.
but they are getting along the
interstate however they're far
away from the metropolitan areas
where we could see us.
Mr chair the.
As far as the patient sees in
the hospice where other
question.
as we all know we're we're in
the middle of
Exacerbated.
Actually costs and I'm not quite
sure where we're gonna be in the
two to three years with us.
construction comes forward all
of the case.
You should be plateauing cease
of savings by that time but I
can't speak for sure.
Fortunately.
Okay.
Thank.
Thank you.
So this is for the questions
again thank you for being here
we appreciate you taking the
time to brief us on your
project.
We look forward to seeing you
thank you Mr chairman members
and thank you for your
consideration.
Mr chairman members we.
the next district coming up is
for your municipal schools they
are also asking for a free
coming at a K. twelve replace
the project this one would
consolidate two separate
campuses and they're also asking
for some teacher housing units
as well as the local match
production and with that I'll
turn your curiosity.
This is my whether Mr position.
All right.
Welcome thank you.
Let's start by saying thank you
for allowing us the opportunity
to sit for you today and those
this project that we have.
Set aside.
If you'll turn to me with me on
page thirty one thirty one here
folks.
It starts of our slide show
presentation
business Ross said we are a
geographically the separated.
Campus we have an elementary
campus and we have a a high
school campus last week and this
is the seventh through twelfth
grade campus they're separated
by approximately two miles
there's a map that will look at
it just a moment but I wanted to
talk to you about the condition
of the facilities as a as an
opener
Our final two thousand twenty
three the new NMCI rankings
respectively the elementary is
ranked number fourteen and the
middle school high school is
ranked number nineteen so
insubstantial need of
replacement our facility
condition index scores the
elementary sits at seventy nine
point nine nine percent and
middle high school eighty two
point zero four percent.
As you can see on this slide our
oldest buildings built in
nineteen twenty in our newest
construction was in nineteen
ninety nine making the average
age of our building sixty four
years.
If you'll turn with me to page
one thirty six you'll see the
campus map we have a forty seven
just over forty seven acres on
the two lots on the to the on
the two campuses combine.
The.
Distance there's a little bit
hard to see but it's a it's a
proximity miles between the
elementary campus that has
seventeen point eight acres and
high school campus as the thirty
acres.
If you will transition on to
page one thirty eight.
The this is an overhead shot of
the elementary campus.
The building on the far right
with the orange colored roof
was built in approximate
nineteen thirty to nineteen
thirty six with that PA money
the building on the top that has
the white color group was the is
all this and built in nineteen
twenty
and then the two that are in
between that are right adjacent
to the current football field
location were built in the
fifties making the average age
of the elementary campus eighty
four years.
For each bill.
The plumbing is absolutely sub
standard we have no teacher
arrested disabilities no teacher
break rooms we have antiquated
Flooring that is maintained is
that the best it can possibly be
maintained by our to the
students but it is.
Subpar at best and the last with
their the structure the
structure stability at
elementary the building that has
the orange Ruth also has the
left side of that building is
classrooms in the right size
gymnasium.
And it is.
Falling apart bricks are falling
out of the wall I don't have
pictures of those I apologize
but bricks are falling out of
the wall substantial price going
up the the whole face of the
building
Moving on to the next slide one
one thirty four one thirty nine
that's in over a few of our high
school campus and so the
building on the far left is our
main gem and then the building
it's it's that far left of that
building with the shared roof
there is not our our.
High school this is our
cafeteria and are we going to do
this in that building.
The one next to it with the
orange roof I'll talk about a
little bit more in depth I've
got some pictures that are I'd
like to show you I brought in
addition to that building is for
high school annex building and
In my tenure I just finished my
first year as superintendent
Springer in my tenure we had a
flood in that building in
September that had four inches
of standing water it has that
building has our library
computer lab for the high school
and it's currently where you
administrative offices are.
For the business manager myself
because the central office.
Is under construction for the
fire.
then a second flood happened
just in may in the exact same
location and so we're having
substantial plumbing electrical
expectations
and then the if you look at that
building on the on what would be
the backside of the building can
see two squares on top of the
building that those are the here
units those were built fifty
five years ago and do not have
replacement parts we're working
with the company right now
that's part of the set of
pictures that I have to show you
that Peter went out and on March
third quite catastrophically and
the building is separated not in
have stuck you would normally
state but it's shaped els so the
heater unit that would be on the
right hand side covers directly
down from it and part way across
the front of the building in the
other here was the other.
So I don't quite understand the
design but we we functioned off
of space years to finish out the
school year which is most
assuredly not cost effective as
far as maintaining adequate
space recent.
So moving on into page one forty
one forty one.
Those are the proposed
demolition pieces to as part of
the questions that were asked in
the other presentations as to
what would happen with the
facilities I'm not positive on
page one forty if that that top
building that has the white
groups actually can be the most
or not because of the possible
hello that is I could not
provide documentation to tell me
whether or not that.
The people that protected
through the struggle registry or
not
on page one forty one.
It.
Shows those buildings that are
proposed to go away.
In this process page one forty
two.
Shows the proposed renewable
areas so when we talk about the
idea of a combined K. twelve
building
we're looking at that space
right there in the red triangle
or excuse me the red rectangle
that would sit above for to the
north of the gym.
Complex
in the hopes to be able to
connect to that in order to be
able to keep that Jim the
infection.
We are also proposing for us for
teachers.
To to to to five units.
that blue rectangle area up
there is the proposed location
it's not nothing set in stone
right here we have got to the
design phase yet but we have the
third available under our
ownership to adequately House
these projects.
So if you look at page one forty
three and one forty four that is
the connection to our facility
master's plan with the amount of
money that is proposed to
maintain our facility at a safe
and functional level for
students our facility master
plan discovery middle in twenty
twenty six.
the total dollar amount there on
the anticipated cost of
seventeen million seven hundred
five thousand three hundred and
forty five dollars.
Then keeping in mind that's if
everyone of those projects is is
down to its fullest within the
facility money plan.
So the the dollar amount to
maintain the antiquated
buildings is slightly below what
the the estimated cost would be
to put a new facility on the
ground.
Moving on to the rules.
On page one forty five there is
a downward trend enrollment
I am happy to say that we are
above.
the marked.
I apologize we're right at the
market and we have tried to and
so we're not losing any more
students are projected to be one
fifteen and rising in the
subsequent years instead of that
downward trend we we're actually
forecast to stay at that one
fifteen for higher numbers you
for.
So I'm gonna go back to on page
one forty six in just a minute
but I wanted to finish up with
the financial information but
then.
So.
Like Mexico we accounted for the
maximum per square footage of
the five hundred dollars per
square foot and on the on the
building itself with a rough
guesstimate rough estimation of
twenty nine million two hundred
fifty thousand for the project
asking for the five tier units
square footage per house to be
determined in the design phase
of four hundred square feet
would be approximately two
million dollars for a total
estimated project of thirty one
million two hundred fifty
thousand.
We we also in the slide I did
not have the demolition but with
the rate of fifteen dollars per
square foot approximately one
point three million dollars on
the fifth division depending on
which of those buildings stay in
the as we move forward
We are unlike are we are just
like Mexico when when we when we
look at the housing situation we
just had a count we just hired a
new counselor for the new school
year that
As I was contacted by an
individual from out of state the
lack of housing determined her
not putting me in position at
all so we are limited to who
will put into positions due to
our housing situation in that
direction.
On the last page on page one
forty eight of your book is a
little bit more the district
financial information
We need to will be you plying
for a waiver we are bonded near
ninety seven percent capacity
right now we have outstanding
two hundred six thousand dollars
is all we have to bond the next
cycle is twenty twenty five in
that cycle will be roughly a
hundred thirty seven students
eight hundred and thirty seven
thousand the best would be where
we would be at.
so this page really fits the the
option to the waiver to fit
those categories
I did want to add a number for
you and there we do have a four
hundred thousand just over four
hundred thousand dollars cash
carryover that has already been
allocated for salaries and
benefits moving to the next.
This fiscal year.
Now I'd like to go back if I may
to.
One forty six.
So when the two that is it but
it's the one forty six forget
the market of.
on the two one campuses we have
across the thirty seven exterior
doors that when I got to
Springer I could not find a list
of who had what she Keyes and so
when my first executive
decisions that Springer was to
have my to students slash
maintenance guys go dead
cylinder every exterior door.
We have he caught the cards that
vote our main entrances that all
the staff have been we do have
some for our substitutes and and
those types of deals but thirty
seven introduces is astronomical
in in my mind this for students
safety goes and so the idea of a
combined building is.
Really about keeping the
students and faculty states in
the event of any type of
situation.
the second bullet point there I
wasn't sure if I can work that
in a way that you could
understand at the high school
campus specifically
that the separated off buildings
I called the chokepoints where
when you have but when the bells
ring to students all walk
through one exposed space.
In between each period if
somebody wanted to cause
catastrophic damage.
That's what that's what the
definition for me for the job in
case you needed that.
As president.
May I bring up a couple of these
pictures to show you guys.
So with that as these pictures
are coming I we stand for any
question.
Thank you for the presentation.
Questions The New Mexico.
It's it's one set this will need
to be passed by apologies it's
three different sets but it's.
Together.
My apologies.
It is.
Mr.
Chair thank you thank
your presentation percent and.
To see more demolition
presentation that.
It appears you're keeping both
of the gins that correct.
Mister chair Mister the purpose
for the keeping up the the.
Jim at the elementary stages
because it's on the stroke
registry.
And so it would not be used as
part of our facilities.
If we were able to do this
project.
Mr chair and if you could tell
me a little bit more you have to
large.
Sites that you of the the
district perspective you're
moving all of the.
School facility pieces to one
side what are you planning to do
with the the other site Mr chair
to be hopeful result would be to
sell off track to help offset
costs.
If I may add one these yes
especially
One of the numbers that that.
In the slide show presentation
but was in the initial
application was the amount of
square footage we ended this
year with a hundred and five
students we have a hundred and
eight thousand six hundred
thirty seven square square feet
and so when we look at the
concept of right sizing our
facility we understand that with
enrollment of one ten one
fifteen hopefully increasing to
the one twenty that's going
range
hundred and eight thousand
square feet is an astronomical
amount of square foot for
students and so right sizing it
down we we understand the
calculator and we understand the
amount of square footage per
student so what we're asking for
is a drastic reduction to right
size of student get a somewhere
in that fifty thousand.
Forty to fifty thousand square
feet if that if that are
possible.
That last question Mr chair once
again.
Graduations and getting your
community on board with.
Funding to this capacity I'm a
little interested to know given
your F. more school or and the
prospect of having a request
replacement how do you intend to
maintain buildings moving
forward.
Mr chair Mister Liu thank you
that's an excellent question we
have a current F. more score of
sixty three point nine seven.
And the.
At the beginning of last this
this last school year of the
line superintendent eight years
so that was zero consistency in
the in this in the
superintendent chair
we have been working hand in
hand with the SFA to get ready
fully functioning in the
district and R. F. more school
or will rise exponentially once
that happens to be able to track
better those minutes efforts.
Thank you.
Mr chair members of if I may add
to that I think part of the
issue with the the last four is
the excess is where it is right
now and antiquated systems that
the just.
Two members of your staff are
for trying to gain so I think
that goes back to what we were
talking about earlier with we
right sizing the efficiencies
that they would achieve an act
that a new facility other
reasonable sized the district
could maintain that better than
two separate large facilities to
that.
Questions.
Thank you your presentation
covered all of the areas very
well
I don't have any questions at
some along the lines of the what
you're gonna do with the with
the vacant facilities and
property down the line but I
think that's a good the.
To have to just.
All up and.
The.
Get some revenue from so called
again thank you for being here
and we look forward to seeing
you in this thank you.
Mr chairman members of one more
district presentation up ahead
we have dexter consolidated
schools.
There have to request before you
one is for dexter middle school
force full full replacement
additionally there's dexter
elementary school which
purifiers upgrades and repairs
and
it's a little complicated but
we'll get into.
And introduce miss heather
Gardner superintendent of text.
Morning concert.
Members of the council.
This is my.
This is my school board vice
president Mr James tallest
building and I have my I'm
facilities manager the business
manager with you will be able
to.
answer any specific questions
and funding questions along
those lines so that let's just
get started.
And we are from extreme we have
a couple of different words in
front of you we do
Begin with our dexter elementary
so that is going to be.
The the the the page number on
page one fifty nine for you this
is the proposed upgrade with a
systems request.
This building is currently rated
at number one thirty three and
the houses are pre K. through
fifth grade.
there are a lot of major system
failures and not facility we had
our walk through.
Right of use and members for PS
that they and the building
itself is beautiful the drive
thru next through the beautiful
to look at but it just does not
account for the multiple system
failures on the inside are
lighting system is completely
outdated.
We have a current I'm going.
H. back.
Issue we had a word for H. back
great in two thousand nineteen.
And there are many issues that
was never completed successfully
and we are working with the SFA
there's some litigation in the
back and to remediate that it
corrected but it still has left
me district and my building
within on functioning system
that involves our fire
suppression I'm a lot of issues
with that system in if you have
time sure K. taking myself K.
get you up to speed so members
of C. ID have been
on campus and Irish office you
it's been it's been quite the
ordeal as a first year
superintendent I'm trying to
figure out how to fix it so a
long when we begin to try to fix
it that's why we're here today
because of the age of the
building are multiple systems
the roofing foundation concerns
on the lightning is completely
outdated we can't get parts it's
all electronic in my
disabilities manager would have
to address those specific issues
but we're in millions of dollars
to update and correct the lady
not disability it is large on
this briefly is this building
was built prior to those
standards be in place
so it is rather large but when
we had to do what through the
cost to replace the building.
Extra footage is roughly the
same greater than the cost to
update the current facility.
So it was a recommendation from
a case of a partners through the
walk through that we look at
maybe doing an upgrade to
address the systems rather than
I'm a costly demolition and
rebuild that would this is the
correct speculation allowances
for for that building size so
our district of more scores is
the one point two eight and that
is only going to go as high
disabilities managers also going
on he'll be in his third year in
the district and so we begin to
see the scores right as we work
together and more intentional
about caring and taking pride in
facilities and I'm taking care
of that.
With that let's move to our
middle school we're requesting a
standards based that building is
ranked number eighty one it was
originally built in nineteen
thirty six and had many
additions and rebuild over the
years there are and other than
the age there are of course the
other issues as well
The flooring the lighting the
plumbing age bracket looks real
structural and roofing repairs
as well in that building that
rank in the millions that it
just doesn't make sense at this
point to continue to pump money
into a facility or a building
that is not able to
the teen and an operational in
the success of the appropriate
for students I'm.
So those are the two things that
we're going to ask for if you
will look on page one sixty one
you can see I'm kind of an
aerial view of and the building
with the blue roof that looks
like an error off to the corner
of your life that is our
elementary campus the big
beautiful building that
everybody sees when they passed
through text or and that is it
as you can tell by looking at it
from the air of you it's very
large and so large facility
And then you can see the
football field over to the far
right and the building right
next to just to the left of that
you can see there's a tennis
court
and then what we called around
building that facility is that
that site right there is where
we would proposes to place the
new build up the middle school
I'm we can keep students house
where they are and how the
current round building is
demolished in the new building
is being built so that we can
just move students over one
three oil to complete that you
can see there's a street that
separates right around the thing
is and high school campus
Further down to the left that
street is already been
incorporated to the district the
city has sign that over we would
ask the do this thing that way
we can fence off and secure the
middle and high school campuses
together we do share a lot of
teachers with that both you this
is the most modest X. do you so
we would be able to finish that
off into one is we're currently
not able to fence that campus
Oct as it stands.
So we would demolish the current
one and move on as you can see
if you turn the page one sixty
to our growing numbers
you know we started just with
everybody else from twenty
nineteen to twenty twenty one we
are projected to stay more or
less this the region from you
know a hundred twelve to eight
hundred.
Nine expects to be a lot of a
lot of ships there the
recommendations that we are the
request that we are asking the
aligned with our facility
minister plan
Addressing a lot of these main
issues that honor would not be
able to address when we talk
about the planning are supposed
planning schedule.
Fees one for that.
For the design phase reviews
when our district is prepared to
meet our match with that so we
would be covering the design
phase that once we move to phase
two for either of course we will
probably be coming it with
another request for a weight
reduction which we do meet the
criteria to apply for that
however we are in a financial
position to be able to cover our
match for fees one for the.
And then of course
Okay construction teasing begin
in twenty twenty four I think
that's a good ambitious but I'm
because of her to stick it out
there
There's an estimated cost for
you but again these are based
off of you know an upgrade of
roughly two hundred two hundred
dollars perfect bring a great
I'm sure that might have been
accurate about six weeks ago
when we first heard this that
probably is not as we come
before you today environment for
the new bills at that time it
was the order of four hundred
fifty dollars a square foot for
roughly twenty million dollars
for middle school facility and.
And our financial information
has been updated since this was
done with our facility master
plan we're currently at almost
ninety six percent
funded to capacity and we go out
on to get into
November and business management
please speak to any specific
financial questions you have
regarding our finances so I'm
checking in members of the
council and the board a into the
patient's email address it comes
from what president.
Thank you Mr Mr chair and
members of the board.
You know this last year
We have difficulty with our
education system in our
elementary school it's an
unfortunate circumstance that
our district has been put in by
the contractor that was hired
along with us to participate
as the superintendents stated we
are looking at the litigation of
the back into this but our
teachers and students are in the
field in the of you is is not
adequate adequately pool and
adequately heated right now
you know.
When into this we need to
replace that system so that you
know our students is that would
be taken care of and and here we
are two and a half three years
later and we still have a
working air condition system all
the safety factors that this is
within the mention of that is a
priority for us and then also
the replacement of the building
the the nineteen thirty nine
building
I can say that I started
preschool in that building many
years ago
and so I know it's been a long
time and and so is the other but
it is something that is not.
And I hope you see to it that
allowed to replace ability to
provide the educational process
questions.
Thank you.
This may be a question Mr chair
for at least that.
What is.
My understanding is there.
SB one thirty one reduction
reduces their match to eighteen
percent is that correct.
Of what we would build the.
Right sizing.
So
That's part of the the program
funds that we're trying to wait
because as it is that.
it is very adequate were through
their school however they do
have the systems that are
functioning properly that you
need to be fixed and upgraded so
that that facility can function
well or needs to be replaced and
so it may not should we repair
replace a building that is
almost perfect.
Has major issues or completely
replace that the fourth option.
Right now.
So that's what we discussed with
the district that was it and and
we suggested that we could.
Focus on the systems necessary
to get that back up.
Mr Chairman all the maintenance
on you know maintaining this
twice as large I'm sending you
all can get help better the
maximum option right.
Each of the claim that keep it
up descriptors of Bill at what
cost is.
And then Mr members of the
council you know that's just
something we have to to look at
and that was part of the the
pros and cons are district
currently is maintaining that
facility we have three
custodians that recount of that
facility I'm and then our
maintenance department does a
great job.
The
You know the things outside of
the traditional to study and
capacity and that's something
that we're prepared to continue
to do if we have functioning
systems but it is it's hard to
stable do we demolish this
building and build a new one and
we know long term the cost of
the more cost effective for the
district
or do we repair it we have and
continue what we've been doing
with that facility.
Thank you got some data
collect to see where you go from
here.
It's a very important decision
only to make
but hopefully with the help of
some professionals and others
that there's of their and
hopefully we'll get you back
here so the.
Thank you for being here thank
you very much.
Thank you
Mr chairman members of the this
meeting will be.
Coming with the financial
numbers calculated in existing
projects elementary will have
several options for the council
to consider.
Thank you thank you.
Mr chair members.
Would you like the ones chair to
start or would you like me to
start first.
to table.
But.
Good morning Mr chair members.
I'm the project before us is a
message from the government
school district to fund to be
set a Menteri school.
The request is for a reduction
in the whole match for the
construction phase funding of
this particular school school
will be replaced in its entirety
I'm gonna start with a little
bit of history this award was
made originally back in July of
twenty twenty one and at that
time there was a state match of
forty percent state sixty
percent local after the war was
need that change to eighty
percent local and twenty percent
state.
The currently
The district cannot for their
match.
Based on current construction
cost.
If the district is successful at
passing a bond in November don't
have fifteen million to put
towards this project in the form
of the payment of the Vance.
Without the combination of
waiver in advance of the match
the district can not execute
their construction contract.
If the construction funding is
deferred to twenty twenty four
the construction documents maybe
we use however the have to be
free
we would due to the changes.
If the bond election passes in
November of twenty twenty three
the district can spell and so
twenty million in February of
twenty four in ten million in
October twenty twenty four.
as of July twenty twenty second
do know that the rate is twelve
which gives them eligibility to
apply for a waiver although the
council has discretion to at one
point.
Back in twenty twenty one the
estimated of your state match
was three point six million.
At three hundred twenty dollars
a square foot today
in twenty twenty three the price
the price per square foot is
that seven hundred sixty five
this group what
like to make a statement there
that when the district when out
for R. P. there were five
contractors who bid on this
there were three
chosen and one finalist it was a
competitive market at the time.
The current amount is forty
eight point of the total cost
for the project into page two
hundred four.
Is forty million nine hundred
thirty three six eighty.
With the state match of nine
point one million in a local
match six thirty six point
seven.
You'll see a page two hundred
four there are several options
that the council could choose
from.
Option one is constructed face
funding for the forty five point
nine million with the state
match of nine point one a local
match of thirty six point seven.
Option two is constructed based
funding totaling forty five
point nine million with the.
But advance of the local match
of thirty six point seven
million but you'll have noted
previously that the funds can't
be sold until
February in October and the
following year.
option three was to receive the
award and we applaud one third
match reduction however money
has already been spent the
planning and design as well as
the word was rescinded there's
no precedence and the money
would have to be separated
additionally we started over the
students would go back into
Chinese of which the district
due to an anticipation of four
has not maintained that would
need to be seven upgrades there.
Which I mentioned in.
A letter.
From the district and I believe
it's about.
Two point seven million dollars
upgrades would be needed.
An option for.
Is a partial Waverton amount of
twenty one point seven and
advance of fifteen million.
behind that page two hundred
five we have a history of this
particular course.
And we have a letter from the
district from name and the first
of twenty twenty one but the
latest District of letter from
the district on page.
Two hundred twenty six.
dated June.
June twenty seventh twenty
twenty three I'm just stating
their request and their needs
for.
For the the waiver and Mr chair
members I will need to the
better the district is here in
person.
Have brief overview hi Stephanie
questions that you might have.
At this point subcommittee chair
lift.
For.
Recommendation share.
thank you Mr chairman thank you
I want to thank you I am very
much for your commitment this
and that recognize the words
that subcommittee this is been a
really
interesting and involved
and different things to try to
support Services best possible
also recognize the weight of the
increased cost and what we do in
terms of setting precedents and
also looking at waivers in the
post potential indication of and
community funding to wait that
we receive districts knowing
that we have all of these other
districts that will be coming in
front of us and we were number
of them today
and then total little bit of a
story that I think at I've
gathered over the course of
working in hearing from the
district hearing from staff and
the commitment particularly the
pharmacy did nominal job at
meeting with actually and
chairman and I in terms of
helping us understand the budget
as you've been really wonderful
at.
So my understanding of what some
of is a little bit of a perfect
storm at the legislative the
twenty twenty one as Mexico
indicated
in men when they applied right
after the fight enjoy the actual
local match changed on that and
so the.
But they were actually.
Really under pressure to then
sort of come up with the money
that they had initially planned
for at the very beginning and I
think that's something to know
then the pandemic happened.
And then after that there's
increased costs that we then see
and the increased cost is
interesting because I think even
looking at the histories of look
at the history of hospitals and
there's a loss on the secretary
that we are all recognize it has
seen before at so there is that
and then it is increased even
further with that we've seen
pandemic internet issues in
terms of workforce and all the
other.
The county it at in factors.
We also see the impact in terms
of land issues Los Alamos a
particularly white back in I
think we've had conversations
and I think Mr lose our
conversations with the district
in terms of combining schools
are looking at repetition really
beautiful samples today of
school districts that are being
very smart in that and yet we
also forced to look at a school
district that has one issues
that it's expanding into their
their school that is in fact in
expanding to serve their
workforce and so it's best to
support them through that
I think that at.
Important part of the stories
that we both have any in the
ready thank you and we do in
terms of the schools at in
that's really after that we have
to take consideration in terms
of money that we don't want to
see at.
Ways we are all the time the
taxpayers and.
That and we also know that
Wilson was expanded to capacity
in the need of a good faith
effort in terms of their
communities.
I think so you know as a
consequence of this sort of the
story of what's happening in
this district I do feel like
going back to the original
publication of.
Councils to support tools and
building or districts in the
buildings of their schools and
their facilities and as well to
be fiscally
All Stewart that dollars the
best of our abilities at.
To the taxpayers in New Mexico.
Those two things balancing those
two things is really having an
important role
I think that that it would also
this is done in terms of their
intentionality their commitment
in terms of the barn and going
up to Boston to them more than
what we see with the trajectory
of their community supporting
them is a really important thing
and I think also that.
What iris in the staff has been
able to demonstrate in terms of
our ability to support them with
this waiver I would recommend to
the council that we actually
need for support or we have read
them the waiver of twenty
million seventeen forty six.
Thousand dollars nine hundred
nine hundred forty four dollars
and then the difference that
fifteen million dollars can be
used to leverage I have to which
they are committed to that.
Yeah.
A motion to be made not a
committee.
Services will require a second
seventeen seconds for that
portion thank you.
Thank you.
Okay right.
Lucien in the second so
like to see if there any cop
other comments from the.
From the council.
Yes thank you Mr chair at.
Two questions then just the yes.
I take it you know.
What the largest Waverly.
Mr chair these two I do think
that information with me but we
do have that history
I just did read today my
apologies Mr chair to look
At the end of in the packet and
I think the last twenty years
the totality it's been about
forty million.
And I think the largest waivers
and about five million.
So does this.
The one million dollar lever set
the largest we relieve proved
why are.
Building to prove at this point
Mister chair Mister movies and
the data that you just stated.
Mr chair I have I do understand
the gravity of the situation
that we have here and I do know
that.
There's a lot of been there's
been a lot of commitments to get
these projects going forward but
I do want to express concerns
given that.
We're still in the middle of the
evening spent almost twenty five
years and.
I think we're a bit concerned
that.
The less affluent district in
the state is requesting one of
the largest waivers we ever had
in history I think that there's
certainly equity issues that
concern and.
A very big concern about the.
Basis of our formula and how we
are approaching our waivers and
the elevation of how we produce
equitable allocations to the
state and I think that despite
having the resources available
we are setting a very.
Dangerous precedent moving
forward I think that.
This is a very difficult project
and I and I'm not sure that I
can favor of this but I do
understand the predicament that
we're in I'm I'm very worried
about cost escalation as well I
know we can't control the supply
of workers I know we can't
control the price this is silly
we can definitely control the
demand of projects and I know
that in the past.
We haven't necessarily.
The for the projects that
schools were not financially
able to do more as well so I
would ask that the council we
consider but I will stand by
and.
That is the the can.
Thank you
Still do you make some very good
points.
This is a very valid points
this is a unique situation and I
don't think we've faced with
that position to face this
particular case before
so I think that we've all.
felt very strongly that we
should not penalize any
students.
This program was set up to help
students in the.
I'm confident and comfortable
with this this project will help
students that are in need of a
good facilities so thank you for
your comments that with the
entertain the other comments
this time.
Representative.
Mr chairman I set the various
presentations on on this issue
and we have the.
Teleconference meeting I do show
concerns that Mr.
Out I wouldn't call it a day
this process because.
If you don't look at it in terms
of what we can do from here for
cat.
I don't think we can just do
this better think of it and not
make at the approach which.
Is just so.
There has to be some.
So.
The ability to decide for.
Contractor.
To this
combinations of that they're
going to have to make still
that.
To me it would make sense that
at that level price was what was
the last.
And that.
Really.
Yes dive into what they're
proposing.
It just all legislative fifty.
That's just a.
That's best the.
Supply chain.
This is.
To to all large increases one.
The project the
Yeah the presidency says we're
accepting seven hundred fifty
five dollars.
Cost.
This that this is.
Thank you for calling.
Mister chair Mister income we
have seen other projects higher
than this we saw eight hundred
and thirteen dollars a square
foot hello in Gallup programs I
can't remember which one in
particular but we also this
committee tasked us with going
back to visit with school and
contractors to reduce costs and
I believe that were reduced by
about one point thank I don't
have the exact numbers to check
I.
So we've we've already at the
request of the chairs it is the
cost by five million going back
to.
Okay.
Then.
So.
Director there weren't meant I
think did a really good job of
talking about the history of
this project and this is a
project that has been studied
and looked at and.
What you just said reduced
Which I think we need to do on
our budget moving forward the
cost per square foot is.
Scary I think for all of us for
the council I think should be
for our legislators we look at
the cost
of construction moving forward I
think it's a concern for the L.
E. asus well and so how we.
Design projects how we share
projects all of these things
have to be really improved going
forward
so I understand Mr lose concerns
and mistreating them I think we
all are concerned about the
sustainability however I think
in light of what Chairman said
something that we continue to
reiterate of the State Council
Our purpose is to help fund
schools and I think that the the
the district has
worked hard to make sure that
they have their local funds
and I just want to reiterate the
importance of moving forward we
really have to to study and
identify ways that we can bring
costs down moving forward.
Thank you.
For those comments
Mr Chairman is I would just need
to be given back up of Mr
Burciaga is coming up I do think
given the presentations weaker
today than what we're seeing is
a lot of these are smaller
districts obviously as well as
some but it is on the smaller
districts is is it needs but
also that coupled with the
inability to support the manage
and I think we may see increased
waivers I think that question
came up earlier and I think this
is an opportunity for the
council the subcommittees to
start looking at maybe whether
we need to reassess how we're
looking at that hello
prioritizing projects given what
we anticipate being an increase
need
so that we can still kind of the
physical physically responsible
the understanding that the need
to stop there and we had a
little bit of the conversations
with the chairs Matt and I think
there's some opportunities to be
creative and think outside of
the box so that we can address
this because I think we need to
sooner rather than later.
Thank you thank you.
Thank you.
The legal go ahead in the call
for the vote on this and
So all those in favor of the
motion please indicate by saying
aye.
All those opposed.
that the record show the vote
and I would like to recognize
the superintendent the board
members that are here.
And for the.
But.
But we do wait till now to give
you know.
Just to thank you
I I just want to thank the
council and will take a lot of
time I don't in the year job
across the state what you got it
before you is is huge and we are
just so grateful for your
patience and perseverance with
us and your help in guiding us
through this process when we
were kind of between a rock and
a hard place so I am incredibly
grateful as a district we are
grateful for your support and we
will fulfill our obligations and
meet the needs of.
Thank you.
If we can.
Thank you also I know that was a
difficult decision for you will
move on to other business.
Its other business and that
would be item seven.
Teacher housing guidelines
update.
Mr chairman members of this
particular housing guideline
update
What was approved by the council
last July
the last July the teacher
housing.
With that line
states that
That
is that through the the release
of the program
The rural areas only where there
is no available housing would be
ten miles of the pilot program
you we there's a lot.
says we're revisiting that spins
and clarifying.
That motion as well as adding
some and recommendations to help
they will run the program.
first and foremost.
Last year it was limited to
rural only we're suggesting to
that I will back into the the
allowable terminology case in
point we have several districts
that.
Maybe requesting future housing
and the definition for rural and
for the kingdom's for the census
is a community with a population
less than.
However there are several
communities in the state that
we have less than five thousand
but non tribal members are not
allowed to qualify for the
housing such as central and
their housing you can then
request for ship right they have
about eight thousand.
Committee members.
But non tribal members cannot
purchase health.
So that's one of the largest.
That we're suggesting.
Additionally you PSA recommend
reading the award funding
similar to the methodology that
we use last year with the SB two
twelve as well as a few years
ago we had the outside advocacy
distributions those would be a
one fifth ward directly issue
directly to the district for use
for the teacher having divine
intervention so that would be
contradictory to what we do with
the standards and systems
actually this is that we have to
face
but for the standards we have
phase one design structure
design K. to construction this
would be both in one fifty.
districts would be required to
submit the documents during
designed to be a state review to
confirm the minimum gross
personages in the compliance
prior to bidding description
also notify the state when the
construction regions of Santa
Lucien at which time yes they
will be the completed work for
verification.
Additional funding needed above
the original award amounts for
the district's responsibility so
that is very key for us to make
sure that the original word
amount to sufficient.
Or decline in construction.
And thirdly the amounts the
award amounts will includes safe
facilities that work in order
for them.
Potential PSUC awards will fund
to the maximum allowable fish
for but for each unit which is
listed below which the council
has previously approved of the
districts must fund over just
units are larger than that
amount the state level matched
by the funding for this program
teacher how do housing units
must be built on district owned
property yes he is the funding
cannot be used to purchase
manufactured housing and you
have a definition for that on
the.
And funds particularly housing
must be spent within three years
of a would be.
You do not have a bullet
indicating that the teacher
housing must be reserved should
need to house teachers only but
we could certainly at that it at
the council will.
It also added
definitions for insufficient
reason what housing affordable
housing rural tribal community
in manufactured housing or if
you would like to.
That is the question.
This was a subcommittee motion
like for you to add comments.
Yes Mister chair and you know
this the committee to fix up I
knew that when we have the
regional guidelines we didn't
want to revisit it to result
there wasn't a lot of discussion
I think at that time about the
very renders the teacher housing
there's obviously need within
the state but there's also been.
The response that we want to
make sure that support as the
statute directs us to so I
think.
you know reintroducing the.
I will based on the staff
recommendation.
A reasonable considering of what
was wrong and mentions that
related to non tribal members
being able to have housing on
tribal property and then I think
we also
that you know for the
recommendation on having it be a
one like things forward there
are a lot of questions around
that because I think there's
always the concern that.
You know with that if there's a
school which is later on
especially as we see you know
cost per square foot increasing
that could create some issues
down
we did discuss you know having
willing to be more strict in the
guidelines which is less strict
I still think there's an
opportunity to visit special
circumstances under that where
something goes but we still
really want to make sure that
the local district is
maintaining their commitment to
the regional market and ensuring
that they are doing their due
diligence through that process.
So again I think this is the big
points but I would definitely
you know welcome any of the
others that committee members
that were part of the
discussion.
So I just wanted to clarify so
this will this.
He distributed.
Of.
The one time basis for these
projects are competing against
each other.
The on going so I believe it
will be at in a way that first
time Mr with the due diligence
made by staff to ensure
districts needing.
Guidelines as it relates to the
role as well as the housing
being at the patients and that
at reasonable in the local area
so will it be a distribution so
much per district.
Or is it based on the project my
understanding is it's just based
on the project and applications
so the staff oversee and I'm
like what would receive a letter
issued requests but.
That's correct receive an
application review it do our due
diligence before bring it over
to you for.
Will the lord and in that time
you will more may not grants
award and then we will.
Thank you thank you for that
clarification.
What was the fact passed.
Mr chair and members.
We were thinking.
So that that many years ago
there was a and you three need
to the two thousand units across
the state and that was before my
time at the state that what
three indicated that there were
a large number manufactured
homes trailers that the
districts that if you're not
saying that
make it function within the very
poor condition and now our
property the or.
People in the system districts
also we we kind of related to
the portables that districts
have across the state the
manufactured housing have a
shorter lifespan.
The the constructed houses and
and what's that like and this is
yes it because of the district.
What to do with the it's very
difficult for them to Medicaid
or replace them.
Mr chair on that point we had
this conversation and
subcommittee and I have the same
questions and miss Ross at the
time I believe you clarify that
that was really about like a
trailer home not so much offsite
you initial kind of pre
construction and then moved to
say and bills or you have some
efficiencies around construction
to just clarifying what the
definition of that is exactly
and my understanding Mister Ross
please correct me if I'm wrong
is that it was referencing more
of
That correct correct Mr chair
and members of the media on the
second page we have a definition
of manufactured housing with
the old from the manufactured
housing.
which is very long but
essentially the for the matters
is that
Acted to a certain size and
on its own chassis and designed
to be installed whether without
a permanent position for human
occupancy so so those
residences that are.
To the patient.
Well Mr chairman thank you
was a manufactured house
changed.
Right right sometimes they do in
the have
to deal with the don't have time
to get out.
Which is that that's okay I just
I was curious as to why because
you just ignore with the fact
that the trade.
And I agree with that difficult
they are not what they were ten
fifteen years ago.
And.
Thank you and.
Mr chair if I may
Mr Bailey.
Definitely appreciate the
comments and that's what it
things about this being a pilot
program as we can revisit these.
policies as we move forward.
So that's something we can
definitely revisit in the future
Mr chair.
Mr chair members if I may add to
that
Just as Mr.
Stated
It's hard for yes they were the
council to control what type of
manufactured housing trailer
that they would be getting it if
we grant award and they have the
money we can't guarantee they're
gonna will get the nicest type
of trailer verses the you know
hello our polity trailer
in addition to that we do have
several districts already
specifically asking for just
manufactured housing trailers
and double life and that's why
we thought it was important to
have a standard policy from the
council so that we could inform
the districts whether.
I think initially when we were
planning for this potential
program we were considering.
Secretary of health.
The two.
One question is is.
It
me that the criteria is whether
or not it has actions in the
state to the side it seems to be
much more appropriate of does it
have a permanent foundation.
What because that is the the
drive on I mean I do believe
there are.
Manufactured housing that is
told to the side what's
installed on.
That that the driver.
So I I guess I would I would
love to look at the different
criteria for manufactured
housing and maybe look to as a
that the house is in it industry
to to try to drive a great to
that would be more appropriate
than the the fact that it's
still too high I think that you
almost have to be built to the
site for most of those
applications.
Mr Chairman string M. I
definitely appreciate those
comments and we'll do our due
diligence there several
districts that are putting
manufactured housing and on
their own and we are going to
take tours close by so we'll
certainly.
We'll certainly take our time to
do our due diligence on some of
these new constructed and bring
that information back to this
council.
Just about because this is the.
To verify what my understanding
is so.
So for manufactured homes
Representative questions up that
payment is maybe frame of side
moves and constructed on site
that's different than having an
intact home.
This bill what the trailer and
then transported and it's fully
intact and that we're
differentiating those two types
of phones you could still.
Purchase manufactured housing
that partially built offsite.
Transported like any other
materials would be on site and
then use those pieces to
construct a house on a
foundation.
Does that make sense so there's
so we're differentiating that.
The last the latter simple that
I gave you is allowed so if you
have components that are
constructed offsite.
The then delivered on site and
then constructed on a permanent
one at on the foundation is
allow.
I'm I I'm not I'm not in the
construction industry I just
want to clarify.
Mr chair if each manufacturer
has to construct also.
There is constructionism the
street six balls I mean they
have all.
Of types of eight nine.
But the high end and has got all
consistent with the New Mexico
their budgets health crazy right
folks were out the binding
effect tonight but the new
place.
The what they have construction.
Chairman.
This right is if they want from
the foundation in their mobile
consider you know you still
can't build used to get these
things to consider.
Thank but it just it's a little
bit concerned when I hadn't
thought about should she call.
That was called the.
Thank issue might be but I do
think there should be a credit
to the fusion and secretary
on the twenty using scratch your
mind the maintenance of what
state needs but which side that
is the labor shortages and
things we can't get out there
thank you bill will be a factor
you gotta you know pregnancy
more.
And I know for instance you want
to travel.
Lands that they have been
looking at that maybe community
house because of the fact.
The decision is think surveys
all the.
Yeah.
The.
Should be more Senator criteria
I mean I've seen a lot of.
Trailers.
But all stations as well so
that'll.
Structure but I think other
other criteria like.
Two by sixes of but maybe you
can look at this and as you
mentioned during the interim
us out of this type.
Yes Mr chair will would be happy
to work with Mr Bailey on that
criteria as we move forward as
well.
So just to we talked about the
ability to tweak these
guidelines moving forward as the
pilots rolled out I think we
have a desire to get the pilot
moving so that people are able
to actually access this funding
and as you said perhaps Mister
Bailey and construction industry
can take a look at it and help
us better
refine our definition around
manufactured housing
so that it's it's clear and
we're not necessarily a lemon
needing them a good option for
how.
She.
In fact.
Instruction in the fact that.
We're gonna rely on you.
Okay all right so this I just
want to clarify so we're adding
tribal.
Back into the right here at team
described you know given that we
had a district present today
about being ninety percent
tribal.
Also I understand Albuquerque
also has a tribal community how
would you differentiate request
from different districts that
have.
Different proportions that are
tribal.
Mr chair members Mr Liu I think
the the important part still
remains where there is
insufficient regional housing
available within ten miles and
under the definitions we have
insufficient reason why housing
defined as the quality quantity
of housing stock available for
sale or rent if not for the
quantity of staff meeting
housing for the all the
available having.
I think we can argue that the
all other maybe tribal areas
there is.
Sufficient housing stock is
that.
First first for.
Tribal tribal areas I doubt will
be in the.
Tens or hundreds of thousands
opposition to the they're still
just about the the world.
Thanks for the quick change.
Yes now we have a most so
committee motion.
For with those in favor of the
motion please indicate by saying
that I was supposed.
To pass.
On to the next slide.
We have an update on those in
the loss.
general's office and their
The line.
Mr chair members that
complication with the go to
meeting so Mr down I is going to
call
Thank you to view.
Thank you.
The door.
Hi Nick this is Jason with your
survey I have you on speaker
phone with the council.
It will be done by phone I
appreciate it sure.
Is to be in terrible or ready to
receive your update we're open
session and to stop to know we
appreciate you taking your time
to give us the latest update.
Thank you can you all hear me
well yes yes.
yeah I appreciate you having me
appear telephonically another
appointment Albuquerque this
morning I couldn't get up in
Santa Fe but I'm pleased to be
able to speak.
The capital my name is Nick I am
the attorney for the state and
for the public school capital
outlay council yeah and the
first is opportunity public
school district percent state.
What the constitutional
challenge longstanding
constitutional challenge to the
state state that them for
funding capital outlay project
the public schools Germany we
well K. region is back in
nineteen ninety eight and
resulted in the establishment of
public school capital outlay
council
that needed them.
Development the case was yeah
and.
When he twenty one and the
District Court issued a ruling
in the plaintiff's school
districts favor finding the
public school basically the
entire system for funding
capital outlay project
unconstitutional including that
if you will a and P. at the hi a
the public school capital outlay
our public school capital
improvement act
after that ruling.
On this record there was which
followed by to
trial to really to part of the
trial twenty sixteen and twenty
nineteen.
So after that really came out in
like twenty twenty we file and
what we call post judgment
ruling our motion though lotion
after the trial for each item
and reconsideration.
Of the court's ruling
for all night we filed and
notice of appeal to the state
the all
Which prepaying file in the
court of appeal
That included in December twenty
twenty two so if the P. O. is
fully briefed in the court of
appeal
it can take.
You know half to two years for
the court of appeals to rule on
an appeal so it is possible that
we don't have a ruling in the
case and L..
Next year it on Friday get a
noted that the case's finds to a
panel of three judges so that is
a in a development that in the
case is moving forward
again though may likely be
another year before we have a
ruling by it's possible that the
case is support three judges
that they could act more quickly
on the case particularly if
they're going to do something
like to send the case back to
the District Court rather than
make a.
Make Google ruling on the
constitutionality of the law I I
also.
The case the I also wanted to
summarize for you all.
Yes Representative in the
pending appeal.
I think it's important now for
person would be yield that there
are both issues that we are not
contesting I don't feel any
issues that we are contesting
the things that we have not
content not appeal
there is a fundamental right to
education in the state
constitution we talked about.
The impact that the state
application to provide
sufficient education all wheel
drive.
We don't have that it measures
whether their patient education
and violations of patients
ability you don't use.
We.
Thank you for.
The property we agree that
having uniformed facility
standards across the state is
appropriate
the issue that we did raise on
appeal and architecting our
first of all the district
court's holding that the law and
they found a constitutional the
public school capital outlay
act.
What capital improvement act
created inequity the District
Court held that those laws.
Maybe the funding capital
outlay.
More inequitable left equitable
life people that.
We have for the log.
After all that
there are there to provisions in
that constitution concerning.
Funding for education there is
that right in article twelve
section one to provide
innovative correct education and
then there's article I section
eight that let local school
districts issue bonds the
build or improve walkability.
And we think that you have to
accommodate both of them
constitutional provision and the
local school districts have the
right to issue bonds and bills
will of the and that could
result in equities just based
on.
I've fundamental constitutional
power that the school district
out.
To what we're trying we have
what we process act you correct.
Martin a lot of them create not
for the the work Max what
actually correct inequity the
result from the usual powers
school districts that.
We're sorry we made on the.
The second argument we made with
that
The court held that the adequate
adequately standard that helpful
you the issue capital outlay
award are unconstitutional
because they have no
relationship to education on the
and we.
Contrary to the testimony that
was offered file.
The standards are developed by
educational act including school
districts from cell and do you
consider education on the
we also argue that there's no
evidence that yeah with the
standard
we will district unable to find
required program so we can
challenge that that fact will
fund the out of the the other
are unrelated educational needs.
argument that we meet on the
field for about Peter argument
which is that after the trial.
The party website the minute
kind of their proposed findings
of fact and these are.
Factual determinations that the
court makes the evidence that
was presented at trial the
playful districts the minute
four hundred twelve I think the
fact and the court accepted all
of those in a blanket ruling
without apparently considering
them individually
I think that were contradicted
by the evidence supported by the
evidence
we argue that that was improper
at the core needed to make an
individualized that much each of
those factual determination to
file.
What you meant that we may.
Are you what that.
This trial began in twenty
fifteen there have been.
Number of very important
legislative changes.
You capital outlay system
including changes that.
Limited many of that the
fundamental basis the plaintiff
in this case.
Like the impact aid credit
the ability of P. charges to be
funded through capital outlay
The end of this system to be
funded the fact that the cleanup
but received large amounts of
money in capital outlay funding
in twenty sixteen and so we
argue that.
Even if the court agrees with
the District Court
at constitutional determination
than reading of that the state
constitution.
Thank you practice report
consideration up the system that
we have now with all the changes
as opposed to what happened that
that exist that affect your
staff.

yield in addition to the fact
that were the case then.

that I can N. F. ur or issue

appeal of the Legislative Health
and next letting their employees

The way that we can do that but
No we can't find.
That we knew about whether the
court.
takes into account and how much
they evaluate them
I I don't know what they will
look at but I think it you know
practice that point issue that I
where are we right the P. all
that really the committee
changed fundamentally if the
District Court ordered this
Lincoln.
Courtship with that
Change them you know I think.
Probably if the court that is
going to send the case back to
the District Court to the change
that them as opposed to what
that meant in the court of
appeal in the first place this
is the the normal normally you
would get the District Court
court the first chance.
That changed but but possible
record you know that immediately
of directly.
