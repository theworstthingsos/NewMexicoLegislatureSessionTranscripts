Senate Bill 379
are are. Um
so we will start
with Senate Bill
396 Hispanic
Student Education and
reporting Lopez and
Senator Cedillo
Lopez and Senator Cedillo
Lopez. You will be presenting that
bill. So you May
begin. >> Thank
you madam Chair. Before
I start explaining the bill, I thought
I'd tell you a story about
why I'm so passionate about
this. When I
started school, I started
first grade, I didn't go to kindergarten
because back then kindergarten
was not free. My parents
had five Children and they did
not have enough money
to send us all to kindergarten.
So when I started first
grade, the teacher
immediately divided us up
into 33
groups, the red
birds, the yellow birds and the
bluebirds.
And I was put in the
yellow birds group, the yellow
birds group were coloring
and learning
their letters.
When I started first grade
madam Chair, I knew how to
read. My mother
said that I learned how to read on
serial card. She says, I, I
don't know how you learn how to read. You just
learn how to read very
quickly. Um I mean,
she helped me, but it
was very easy to
me.
And one day I went
home and my
father said,
you know how school and I started
crying
because
it was so devastating to me that I
was coloring and the other
Children were reading.
Um And so
I,
um
my father went to the school
and he was not a person who
challenged teachers, but
he went and to the
school and he said, why do you
have her with the slow group? Which
is what she called it when
she knows how to
read.
And she said, well, she didn't go
to kindergarten
and my father said, but she
knows how to read. And the teacher
was surprised
that I knew how to read.
She gave me a pack of
mimeographed sheets
and said, you
know, if she can do these mimeographed
sheets, I'll put her,
I'll mov'e her up in, in the
groups. So I went
home and I did all of those sheets
that night. And I
went back and I took them,
the teacher then said,
did your parents help
you with this?
And she made me do a
mimeograph sheet in front
of her before she moved
me up.
How you perform in
school depends on
expectations and the
opportunities that are presented
to you.
And that is why I
am absolutely
passionate about
this bill. I will
tell you who was in the,
in the little yellow birds
and who was in the
bluebirds, the
Hispanic
kids,
you know, Maria Jose,
the Hispanic kids.
And when I moved up to the
Bluebirds, I
was with Jolene
Nancy
Janet
Robert
Kyle
and that is wrong madam
Chair. That is absolutely
wrong. And so
the Hispanic Student Education
Act and Reporting Act has a
long history.
And what this
bill attempts to do
is it attempts
to um
modify the language
to include
the the term
community-based. Let me pull the
bill community-based
in reference on section
two uh
in reference to organizations
involved in in improving
uh our educational opportunities
for Hispanic students.
And as I told you that story,
madam Chair,
it is very important that the
community be involved with their
children's education is
the Children have high
expectations
of their
education.
Um On page
two, it provides
for the higher education
department to be involved
in planning for Hispanic
education. What you see
now in um
higher education is more
emphasis on
Hispanic education and more
research and learning.
Um and that is really
important.
In addition, this expands
the, the advisory
um the advisory
uh element
to include
post-secondary
education. I
have another story about
post-secondary education, but I'm
not gonna tell that today.
Um And
then on page
four, it provides for a measure
for Hispanic achievement
measured by a statewide test
approved by the department with results
desegregated by ethnicity
because you can't measure,
you can't improve what you don't
know. And so the,
the testing important uh
requirement is really
important on page
five school district
initiative to increase
the number of school dropout and
increase attendance that would
improve. That would be improve
Hispanic
um dropout
rates or lower Hispanic
dropout rates. But
also those initiatives
would help african-american
and native students who
also suffer,
um decr uh
incr uh
dropout rates that are higher
than the, than the
average.
That's what this bill does.
It makes the bill strong. It
makes the Hispanic Education
Act which has been around. I
think it was Senate uh
Representative Nieto who
introduced it probably about
20 years ago. Um,
but I'm ready to
stand for questions.
>> Thank you, Senator. So
we will go to those in the
room. Is there anybody in
support in the
room?
Anybody in
opposition?
Do we have anybody on
Zoom?
One person? Go
ahead.
>> Hi.
Hi, I'm in, I just wanted to
make clear I'm in
opposition.
All right, madam, Chair and
Members of the Committee.
My name is Elena
Vicenta Valdez.
I'm a professor and former high
school teacher. I
have a daughter who will begin
pre K next
year. I speak to
share my concerns about Senate
Bill 396
there are parts of the bill that will
generate not only confusion and
inconsistency but also
more work at the school level
where teachers are often
already overworked and
under-resourced.
I frame my concerns as
questions because I feel educator,
students and their families like my
own need answers.
First, I point to section
two part D which aims
to ensure the maintenance of the
Spanish language
to my knowledge. Language
education is the
purview of the language and
culture division which
oversees implementation
of the Bilingual Multicultural
Education Act.
How will the Public Education
Department with its distinct
bureaus and divisions
share oversight of
Spanish language
education?
Now let's think about section
five, the systemic
framework which would require
districts to develop and publish
a systemic framework for
improving educational outcomes
for students. I
believe it is crucial for all
the parties mentioned in the bill,
the school employees, Hispanic
students and families, social
service providers and
organizations
to demand more from their
schools to cr core
solutions that address
the so-called achievement
gap. But if districts
are not already
involving these folks in
their school board meetings, their
parent advisory councils
and working with them to
make tangible changes
in teaching and learning, then
this is then, isn't
this the problem that needs
to be addressed?
Finally, consider section
five parts B through D
which reference
Culturally relevant
services, curricula,
instructional materials and
so forth. My
questions for the Committee
are, what
resources would the
State provide to ensure
compliance? What
resources would the State
provide to build new
services and materials?
Finally, who will
determine what services
and materials are the quote
unquote? Right ones.
Thank you for your
time.
>> Thank you. So all we have
on one more on
zoom, one more on
Zoom.
>> Yes, I'm on Zoom.
Yes.
>> So you May begin.
>> Thank you so much.
Um Madam
Chair Members of the Committee.
Thank you so much
for allowing
us to share this morning
specific to Senate Bill
396.
I do stand, I do
also stand in,
in uh,
oh, sure, forgive me. Uh
Adrian. So the one
center for the education and study
of diverse
populations.
And so I do also stand
against uh sen Senate
Bill 396.
Um, and I'm, I'm kind
of, I'm torn, right
because I, I
um there, there are
parts of it that I'm in favor of. I
very much appreciate it. Uh What
was shared with us regarding the yellow
and bluebirds, uh the
importance of family partnering and
also uh the, the
importance of being inclusive of
higher education.
However, I do have a
similar concern specific to the
overlap with the language and culture
division and Bilingual
Multicultural Education Act
uh specific to the Spanish
language. I
am also curious about
uh letter P um
item number one uh
where it states a uh
measured by a
statewide test.
Um I it makes me
draw up a flag as to
whether or not this is an
additional uh summit of
assessment at the end of the year
or if we're referencing
uh the State approved Summit
of assessment that that is typically
administered. Um
And then the importance obviously
of being disaggregated according
to ethnicity. I
is, is important.
I would um encourage
us to, to look at that language
as well. Uh When I think
of a systemic framework, um
letter A on
page five, I believe,
um are we asking districts to
create what the New Mexico Public
Education Department has been asked to
create regarding a plan for Martinez
Yazzie, again, this
places the the
drafting of a framework onto
each school site without
any clear guidance from
uh the public education
department about the direction
that they want to formally
take as far as a developed
plan. And then
the next area that I have is on
page five.
I'm curious about
where it says the
uh the Hispanic Education
liaison shall
assist the school district as
required during the development
and implementation of the framework.
I'm I'm
curious about how a single individual
will support 854
schools or 100 and
29 school districts
to develop and implement
these, these efforts.
I'm I'm thinking that perhaps there's
some amendments that could be applied
um uh And,
and some minor changes that can
be added to this.
Um Lastly,
um again, uh
just thinking about some
of the systems that are already in place. I'm
curious about where equity councils
are. Um And
how uh perhaps some
of this work can be
connected to some of those
efforts that have already existed
with that uh Stated, I thank
you all so much for the work that you do
on behalf of the students
of New Mexico and in particular
Hispanic students of New Mexico. Thank
you.
>> Thank you.
We will go to Committee
Members. Any
questions from
Committee
Senator Souls? >> Thank
you madam Chair.
I've looked through all of this.
What does this actually
do? I mean clear
back on the new section on the
systemic framework.
But even that is full
of May do
this. They May
include this. They May include
that doesn't require
anything. What does
this actually do
or require or
change? And what happens if
somebody doesn't
understanding,
>> remember your mic >> madam
Chair? My understanding of the Hispanic
Education Act is, is, is
um it creates an
advisory Committee
and the
advi
that's not amended by this bill,
not touched by this bill. I'm talking about
the whole, the whole thing.
Um
The advisory Committee
is charged
with meeting regularly and providing
information to pe
D uh and
providing suggestions to
pe D. Um This
gives guidance to the
Committee and also gives
guidance to P pe D.
Um I think that the last
part response
gives because it's got the
maize and the, and the, and
the shells the way they
do, the way it
does. Um
It supports
what the Mazi, the
Martinez Yazzie
opinion.
Um How
do I put it measure? Not
only just measuring the success
but providing a framework
for success. In that
opinion. My understanding
of what has been a problem
with, with the, the
Yazz is there has the
opinion is there hasn't been a great
deal of communication between
the plaintiffs and
the,
the defendants. I guess
the State with
regard to.
Um
I think the expectation was that the
State would bring a lot more to
it than the State has
brought. Um
It, you can't just
throw money at a problem
that doesn't resolve the problem.
What you need to do is you need
to involve the community,
you need to create a plan
and a framework for
improving
outcomes. So,
for example, just back
in my little bluebird
story,
the teacher never assessed
my,
my abilities.
Um the teacher
put the Hispanics
in the yellow birds
um and then
use the excuse that
they didn't go to kindergarten.
Well, we
couldn't afford it, we couldn't
afford kindergarten back
then. Um And
so as I
said, um
if you don't have any
focus on Hispanics
and you walk into the classroom
with ex with low expectations,
that's what happens.
And that's why
this academic and
other programs May include high-quality,
professional development.
This doesn't dictate,
it gives guidance
and it's
guidance that
apparently has been
missing because
that lawsuit has not been
resolved.
>> Madam Chair and Senator. I
still get back to
what does this require
anyone to do?
You know, on the new material on page
five, school districts shall develop
and publish a systemic
framework. Where do they
publish
it?
We make sure
that they did it.
Um And then all
of the other things to go into
it essentially are
maz it
doesn't have anything that
requires anything
so they could publish
something that's
two paragraphs long.
There's no,
you know, who reviews it,
where does it get published? I
mean, it, it's all
hollow and the whole
list then of the
shall include culturally
relevant program services
curriculum and
other
pieces and
it's then everything else is
May, May,
May, which means they
don't have to do any of
that. Get
back to what does it
really do >> again?
It is guidance, it
is guidance for a department who
seems to have not
understood what
is required to settle this
lawsuit. And so,
um i
it gives guidance, the
school districts.
Um my understanding
is that, that they
publish their
material on not all
their material but what the school
districts goals and
objectives are on their websites.
If you go around and you look at them
um whatever, if
systemic framework they
publish, they have
should be published on the website
is how I interpret this
um with regard to
um who
is gonna hold them accountable.
Pe D is ultimately
responsible for everything,
but there is a Hispanic
Education Committee
again, that's not touched by
this bill, but in the other parts of the
statute and it's the
Committee that
has met has
provided input to PE
D. Um The,
the Committee was practically
disbanded um during
the Martinez administration
because she didn't appoint anybody to
it. Um And
so the prior,
the Committee Members that had been
appointed to, to the
Richardson Mr. administration
whose terms were running
out, met
and tried to
um tried
to um
again, provide their
expertise and input.
If you look at the membership of that
Committee, it's commi
it's, it's
um
educators both
higher ed
and
um
high school level
and also it
uh in uh
what do you call it?
Um grade school
level eight through 12,
I guess, um educators
with experience in bilingual
education, with experience in
teaching Hispanic kids, with
experience in gifted
programs. Hispanic
Children are
underrepresented in
gifted programs. It was
actually a dilemma when my daughter
was invited to be in the gifted
program because I was
uncomfortable with her being
in an all-white
classroom
and that is
unacceptable.
>> Go go through the madam
Chair,
madam Chair, madam
Chair and Senator,
I understand all of that.
This doesn't say this has to
get approved by the Public
Department. It doesn't say it
has to be published on the
district's
website.
Um It doesn't
have all of that and typically,
I don't recall lots of places
where we pass laws
to give guidance to
somebody about what
they ought to be doing
without telling
them something they have to
turn in or
do.
I don't, I don't see any
of that in here. You know, I
don't disregard any of
the stories about that.
We underserve our Hispanic
students or anything of that
sort. I don't see
that this gets us anywhere close
to that. It requires
setting up a
framework
and then it's full of
maize
>> Chair. Would you like all of those turned
into shells >> madam
Chair? What I'm saying is
it needs to actually require
somebody to do
something and
what? And this doesn't you
know, this is guidance
for what they should have been
doing. We've got a
number of places and people
that are working in these
areas, most school
districts have bilingual
education departments where they've got
people who are doing all of
this, you know, at least
that some of the districts that I
know. Um And
this for the districts that
aren't, this
requires that they
publish a framework,
you know, but doesn't have anybody
review as to whether it's appropriate,
whether it's adequate, anything
of that sort. I
just don't see that this requires
anything other
than makes us feel
good that we're hoping
people do better around bilingual
education.
>> Really interesting. I'm
not in the
education but are you telling me,
Pe D doesn't review
bilingual education
or Hispanic
outcomes?
Is that what you're telling me
>> madam? Chair, madam,
Chair and Senator I'm not,
this doesn't require pe
D to review these
frameworks
>> and publish a systemic member
for improving education outcomes
for Hispanic students.
I would accept
amendment that will be reviewed
by PE
D.
>> I'm not recommending
an amendment, you know, but
I it just doesn't
require anyone
willing to do
anything
>> madam Chair. I'm happy
to add. Um If
somebody, if, if somebody wants
to do it, that will be reviewed
by PE D, I'm surprised
because I would have
expected that
to
happen.
>> So we'll need
a motion for,
to mov'e the
amendment
student.
Senator
>> Madam Chair, Senator
So your
assumption is that PD is
already doing this.
>> Um My
assumption is that pe
D madam Chair
is reviewing
what's going on
and not understand
understanding what they need
to do, not
including not
um
give it getting the guidance
that they need to do a
good job. And that's what this my
understanding is. That is
what this bill is an
attempt to do is give
them some kind of
guidance
>> madam Chair. So they
are doing it, but they just don't know what they're
doing with the information when they get
it
>> madam Chair. The only reason I
say that is because
Martinez
um uh
Yazzie case has not
been settled and apparently
progress has been very
slow. Um
This framework
would be some guidance to
help them show that
they're moving
um in a, in a positive
direction.
Um There has not
been my understanding. So I
just to be transparent,
I uh served,
I'm no longer on the board um
served on the directors of Malde
e when the lawsuit was
brought.
And so I'm very familiar
with maldive attorneys and
my discussion with those attorneys
is total lack of
communication. Um
And so it seems like it takes
some Legislation
to,
to push them to show
them what needs to be
done. Um And
what would be really
great is if they had
a plan, school district by
school district, that was
a transparent plan that
they involved the community
in it. And that pe
D paid
attention to it
and reviewed
it,
>> madam Chair. That's all I
have.
>> Do we have any more discussion by
Committee
Members?
Senator Maestas >> madam
Chair? Thank you, Senator
Lopez. This is
a, I'm glad you brought this
forward because it gives us an opportunity
to read the
Hispanic Education
Act which
was passed back in
2010.
You're right. Uh Nine
months later, there was a change of
administration uh
in the midst of the great recession.
So there
was a lot of things that
were required by law
that were not
implemented
by the previous administration
of because of lack of
funding a no tax
Pledge and just the lack
of a lack
of will, a lack of accountability.
So this, this was definitely one of them.
So anyway, it's it's the first time I've read
it in years. So it's good to see
it. Um
So madam Chair Senator Lopez,
the uh
you know, if I could wave a magic
wand, probably the
number one problem I would
solve in this State is the
achievement gap of Hispanic
students. Obviously,
the achievement gap of native
students is is
just as important, just as severe, but
there's a lower
population. I mean, the
achievement gap in Iowa is like
whatever 8% of the
students 12, the
achievement gap in the city of Mexico
is upwards of 75
to 80% of the
students.
So the question is, how do we
as a State
uh teach
uh you know, Hispanic
and native students to succeed in a
modern society.
Um modern
English speaking society
uh with laws that, that derive
from, from Old England.
So, you know, it's
tough to have these conversations
because you have to talk about
institutional racism
and all that good stuff which, which
people get defensive about, but
we really shouldn't.
Institution racism is the
institution
and how to each individual with his
own institutions.
See
it
accumulate data and, and
mov'e forward given
that data. So I
like the changes of madam
Chair Sy Lopez with regards
to uh
with regards to uh ensure
the maintenance of the Spanish
language that
we should definitely keep an eye on that
the addition of community based
organizations.
Uh But with
regards to Senator Soul's
concerns, uh uh on
section five, I have the
same concerns with regards to the
Act itself, which has been in, in
it existence for 15
years. So who,
who madam Chair CCI Lopez,
who is the Hispanic Education
liaison within
the Department of
uh
Education
>> madam Chair? I actually
don't know who
the liaison is.
>> Madam Chair, Senator Lopez. I don't
know either. I don't even know if there
exists one or if there ever has
existed one. It would
be fantastic if there was
someone in State government
that woke up every morning, went to
bed every night charged
with implementing this act.
Uh Also
um
the uh on
page four lines, 18 through
20
you know, the, the, the statewide
status report.
I don't know if I've ever seen
the status report,
but the department shall
submit an annual
preschool through
post-secondary statewide
Hispanic Education
status report. I don't know
if I've ever seen
that, but presumably
there's one stashed in the library
somewhere. But I really
like the way you said,
uh, you
know, Hispanic student achievement at
all grades as measured by
other students. Hello?
like what's the,
you know, you you have to measure
it per other students
or else what's the point?
And then of course, uh what
are school districts initiatives to
decrease the number of dropout and
increase attendance? But I think
like improving on the act,
I think is is
awesome.
Section five madam Chair
of it's kind
of a slight contradiction.
Some of the criticisms were
we can do this, we can't do that, we can
do this but and then and
then, but it's a
May and then there's
other criticisms that say what is
it? It's a May. So it's like, well,
which what do you want?
But I do think section five
madam Chair,
the Lopez is somewhat problematic
because what
does it do? Who does it and who's
accountable for doing it?
Um So I
would ask uh
if you would uh consider
a friendly amendment to keep the
language sections one through
four and to
strike section
five
>> for that friendly, friendly
because then it's not
highlighting what needs to be
done. Uh,
what should be done. This,
this says
May because it gives
the specialists
the discretion about how
it's done and what, you know,
the pieces of it. Uh, I
do like, I would
think it would be a friendly amendment
if after on
page 16,
um, before
the period that will
be reviewed and considered
by the public education
department were added
because then
that puts some obligation
on the public Education Department
to at least review
this. Um, at least
review what the school districts are
doing. Um
I don't think it's good
for legislators to tell
and, and you can see that, that
with what I said yesterday to
tell, uh, experts
how to do their job. I
don't. Um,
but when
experts,
huh, what,
when experts,
um, don't
do anything,
then you have to tell him to do
something. So
that's why I would not, I would
not consider that a friendly
amendment. I would,
um, I would
consider a friendly amendment to have
that will be reviewed by PE
D reviewed and
considered by
PE D. Thank you.
So that the experts at least would have
the information. >> Thank you,
madam Chair, Senator
Lopez.
That's unfriendly by the sponsor.
I won't propose
it
>> any other questions by Committee
Members.
The Chair will entertain a
motion.
There's a motion to table
which is undebatable
and need it. Please call
the
roll.
>> Senator Sanchez,
Senator Sheriff,
Senator Souls,
Senator
Pinto.
3 to 2.
You take,
>> so Senator, uh Senate
Bill 396 is
tabled
will go on to Senate Bill
468
do my bill.
Um There is a Committee
substitute
>> whenever you're ready. Please go
ahead. >> Thank
you, Senator. So Senate Bill
468 is
a tribal liaison
bill which
appropriates 33 million
to the general from the general
fund to local government
divisions of
the D fa
for fiscal year 26.
The purpose is to try
uh fund tribal liaison
programs in each county
to ensure native Americans
populations equal
access.
So this bill, uh
we went, we had a meeting
out in
um
Santa Ana but we were over in
Zio. Pueblo,
Sandoval County has three
tribal liaisons. They
um go around about regionally
and the program seem to
be very, we had a lot
of posit positive impacts
from the program that they are
running that the county
actually um
voluntarily
established.
And with what we're
experiencing with the capital
outlay, delays and
much of um the needs
of our tribal nations.
This bill
is to
give them access
to, to opt in
the Committee substitute for
this bill. Um
If we would like to
mov'e
that,
>> I would
mov'e a do not pass
on Senate
Bill 468
and they do pass for discussion
purposes
on
the Committee. Substitute for Senate
Bill 468.
I think I did
that.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair
mister Chair Members of the
Committee. So the Committee
substitute was just to really clarify
language that the counties
did not actually have to do
this. But it was
that if they May participate
in this program, because we
know not all counties
have um tribal
nations within their
boundaries, but it's also
not requiring them
to have
the
uh a tribal
nation within their, within
their county either because
some of our uh
like having
IPCC in
Albuquerque, the
Indian Public Cultural Center,
if they wanted a liaison
to work in that capacity within
that county, that they could
create such a
position to
help in, in
that, in that aspect.
So I stand for
questions and that was all the
Committee substituted.
>> Thank you, Senator. And
first did the audience those in
support
the audience. Anyone in
opposition.
We have anyone
online?
Senator. Would you like to comment on the
fact that there was no comment
uh questions from the
Committee.
>> Does, uh
Mr. Chair Senator,
does each,
um
does each State agency
have a tribal
liaison
or is what,
what, what does this do a little
different? >> So
Mr. Chair and Members of the
Committee. Yes,
there are tribal liaisons
within the departments.
Um, but specifically
asking about education,
this al this brings the
county and if there's a
municipality within the
county to have
someone working to be
that person to
communicate with the,
um, with our State
agencies, it
seems we are still
in a gap of,
and it's really in response to,
to capital outlay and how much
we're not able to close that
gap that if we really
have someone dedicated
to
bridge that communication,
maybe we'll have a little bit better
um lower
amounts for reauthorization
in that
fact.
>> Uh uh
Mr. Chair, thank you for that.
That's all the only question I have
>> other questions. MCM
Mitie, Senator Maestas.
Thank >> you, Mr. Chairman,
Senator Pinto.
I'm reading the, the
substitute.
Um No, I
think this is key.
Uh This is key. I'm
glad.
So the substitute kind of emphasized
the county clerk's
office
>> counties. Yes, Mr.
>> Chairman,
I think um
I don't know about other cities, Mr.
Chairman, Senator Pinto, I think
Albuquerque has
one of the largest uh native
populations of any city in the
country. Um
There's probably more, I think if
the native population in Albuquerque
were
combined,
what would it rank in terms of
the tribal mem,
tribal Members would be the top
three, the
largest populated
tribes?
>> Mr. Chair Members of the
Committee.
That's why it's more like a program
to be run because we
don't know the specifics
of the areas in
which issues
need to be addressed.
Um, like I said, Sandoval County,
they decided to do theirs
regionally over, they
broke it up. But if
we want to do on population
base, um, that is entirely
up to the county, how they want to
tackle. Um,
but they want their tribal
liaison to address
if it's a specific population
area, if it's a geographic
area. Um,
you know, that's, that's entirely up
to them. So they have that
flexibility.
>> So sure.
Anything.
Thank you,
Senator Mike questions,
$30 million or
$33 million.
What is that going to
be used for? You? Talked
about it sounds like some salaries,
but that's pretty high pay
salaries.
>> Mr. Chair Members of the
Committee. It was interesting
because I did reach out to Sandoval
County to see what their
costs were. We still have
not gotten anything back that
quickly, uh about
the bill or about this
particular, um
how they address or
how they allocate to
their program that is
there. So the 33
million was just because we
have the 33
counties and
we'll see how, how it
goes.
>> Thank you. I think about
some counties like Capron
County that have a total of what,
400 people in it.
I mean, there's some that are very small
million dollars is a windfall
for them and for
Albuquerque to be able
to do some of these things,
you know, this is probably
insufficient for their
1
million
just kind of curious
where, where that's gonna
get spent and
how it sounds like it's all for
salaries, but all
counties are not
equal
>> and Mr. Chair Members of the
Committee. So
that's why it's kind of an
opt-in, if
they, if they have
the need that they're
able to access it.
So I don't expect that each
county will each get
a million, um,
depending on how they
decide to
address
the
tribal
issues within their, their
area.
>> Senator, some of the counties
over on the east side don't have
very many tribal
Members and they still
apply for their million
dollars and spend it
to encourage the
five tribal Members to go
vote.
>> Mr. Chair Members of the Committee.
I think that would be hard to
justify and probably
be easily,
um,
uh, with
oversight, not easily
done. I'd like to
think
>> Senator, you know, as
somebody puts in for this
money and let
me see to the local
government division, Department of
Finance,
who would they be making
application to and who
would determine
that Eddie
County isn't
eligible for a million dollars because
they've only got, I'm making it up
15 tribal Members
who determines
how big the grant is, how
much each one should get.
Who, where do they apply
to? How would that work?
>> Mr. Chairman, Members
of the Committee, that's why we have
it um going through D FA
because DF is also
the entity that handles a
lot of our tribal
monies that are allocated
that don't go to the Indian
Affairs Department.
And we didn't want to put it
in the Indian Affairs Department
because we did not feel that they had the
capacity. So when we
talked about the allocation,
I believe DFA does have the
capacity
>> and madam Chair does DF,
are they comfortable
administering all of this
and doing
that work? And it would it
be the county clerk's
offices that are making
the application for the
liaison to D
FA
>> Mr. Chair? I do not
know that
answer.
>> Ok. I
just
wonder how that would work in
practice.
>> And Mr. Chair, I think that
that process, I, I
don't really know, but I just know
that we do allocate money
to D FA and then
it's left up to them as far
as um the process they have
set up for any kind
of grants or any kind of
um
funding
applications.
>> Ok. Below the Committee
I think this goes to
finance next.
We let them sort it
out
motion for a due pass
second by Senator Maestas.
If you'll call the roll,
please.
Uh, Signature Souls.
Yes, Senator
Pittock,
you have a new pass
on to finance and
we'll let them sort it
out.
>> Ok. Thank you, Miss,
uh, vice Chair
and Members of the Committee.
Now we are on to Senate
Bill 498
with Senator Harmel
and you May begin.
Senator,
>> good morning madam, Chair and Members of
the Committee. It's good to be back
in this Committee room with you.
I miss being part of this
Committee. Uh, what's
in front of you is Senate Bill
498. And what you're
gonna notice is there are three
Senators who have signed on to the
bill myself from
Northern New Mexico, Senator Maestas
from what I call Central New
Mexico and Senator Kerry
Hamlin, who's southern New
Mexico. And the reason
being is you're gonna see that there's
pride in every
area of the State,
North central and south
when we talk about lowriders.
And so while the exact origins
of lowriders is subject
for fierce debate in
the 19 eighties M
TB coined Espanola
the low rider capital of the
world as a hometown
native son of Espanola. It's a
title that we've gladly
taken and one that we've kept
ever since. And it
stuck with us and it's
pride in the Espanola Valley,
but it's pride throughout the State of New
Mexico. As you know,
madam Chair, Lowriders are a
work of art expression of
faith and culture and
cornerstones of families, not
only in Espanola, but across
our great State.
Lowrider culture. Madam
Chair is alive and
well throughout New Mexico.
Now, Lowrider and car enthusiasts
from all over the world come to
New Mexico to check out New
Mexico's Lowriders.
And so there's celebrations
that happen every year.
Um They're part of our
community, their style
engraves their
art exhibits on wheels
that cruise past
every city throughout New
Mexico. Now this bill
piggybacks on one that center
soul's deal making
the chile the official
aroma of New Mexico. This
bill madam Chair would make
the Lowrider the official
car of New Mexico. It
was brought to me by an
Albuquerque City councilor.
It was then
enthusiastically
approved by car clubs
throughout the State of New Mexico.
And the Espanola Valley was
excited to see that
this could be an official car club.
And I have somebody with me from a car
club from Albuquerque who will
introduce himself and make a few
comments.
>> Madam Chair Members, the
Committee
uh Clarissa Bea
wanted me to,
she couldn't make it. She had
some family things that were going
on, but she asked
me to express her full
support and, and her thanks
in this matter.
My name is Lorenzo
Otero. I'm a proud American
and a proud Nuevo
Mexicano.
I love where we come from.
I love what we represent. I
love our culture.
We are blessed to live in a beautiful,
powerful and majestic
State like New
Mexico, our
gente our traditions,
our culture,
our heritage, our pride
as New Mexicans is
engraved in our hearts and in our
souls
for a moment. If we could just
visualize
the different symbols of New
Mexico
that, that define who we
are, that shows who we are
as a people,
our State flag,
the Zia symbol which
represents the
sun,
it represents the
sun, the four directions,
the four seasons, the
four times a day and
the four seasons of our
life.
Our nickname the land
of enchantment I believe says it
all.
Sorry about that. The
Yucca, the
balloon,
the aroma
red or green. Our New
Mexico, our New Mexico
question.
These all mean these are all
symbols that mean something to
us as New Mexicans
as proud New Mexicans
and with your help,
the low rider
to be our New Mexico State
car. Low
riding started in New Mexico.
Although others have tried to claim
it. Low riders in
New Mexico are as much a part
of our culture as red and
green chili. These
are beautiful works of
art. They're mobile,
they mov'e, they're majestic
as they go through
as you can go as they go down the
Street, you can sit there and see
them. They're different colors.
They tell a story of who we
are in our way of
life.
The Lowrider is a part
of every celebration in our
cities from in every
one of our cities throughout the
State.
We have had a no rider in our
airport for the
world to see
anyone that's coming or going
in and out of the State
has got pulled into the airport,
has seen low riders and
lowrider cars, trucks
and everything
else.
We have Lowrider night
at the Isotopes.
We're at the New Mexico
Bowl.
Sorry about that. We are at the New Mexico
Bowl and we are even
on the teleon in,
in New York
City and I don't know if
you knew that, but that car was a
New Mexico car that was showcased
out there in Times
Square,
the New Mexico Lowrider scene
with the help of our champion, our
cruising counselor, Paisa
Pena repealed the
cruising ordinance in New
Mexico. Now
we are instrumental in passing
on that formula to other states
throughout the entire
country.
The Albuquerque Lowrider Super
Show brings in
people from all over the
country and other
countries to
showcase.
They come in and we're
blessed to be able to showcase our
culture, our
music, our food,
our people and our
Lowriders.
We are pioneers.
We lay the groundwork, we lay
the foundation.
We are trendsetters with
Lowriders. We have been able to help
our people that are in need,
help promote local
businesses, help
communities, help
promote unity, bridge
gaps. We have a low
rider as a cop
carter, which is
a beautiful thing.
These are traditions
that have been passed on from generation
to generation. Low
riders tell the story of our
people. They represent
us as a culture, as
a as proud New Mexicans.
The low rider is more than a
car. It is a
symbol to who we
are. As New Mexicans.
Please vote. Yes on
this.
Thank you.
>> Thank you madam Chair. And in closing
just so, you know, it made
a lot of international news
that we were attempting this
the furtherest it went to a South
China who wrote, who took
the A P article
about the low rider becoming
the official car in
Asian countries. We're starting to
see a huge increase
on a low rider culture
in those countries and with
that, we yield for questions.
>> Thank you, Senator.
So we will go to those in the
room. Do we have anybody
in the room with that
show support
does in opposition
those that are in support? Would you
like to make a comment or just
straight hand
to come up
to them?
Come up to the mic
chart.
>> Good morning madam
Chair Members of the Committee. I'm
talking on my own behalf
as coach Jacobus
AA, actually, that was my maiden
name, but
I really stand in
support of the low
riders. And I'm gonna say a little
bit of why
I also
represent the
steam engine in
Albuquerque the
2926
and that has been
we
formed, reconstructed
and redone and now
runs just like the
low riders. They done,
they take the car and do the same
thing. It's not,
they're not, cars are
not quite as big as this
monster I
represent,
but it's the
same aspect
that we're saving something in
New Mexico that is
within culture of
everyone in the State.
So I stand in support of
this bill simply
also because I'm
Hispanic. I come,
I know I know
the, the
worthiness of it
all and the
people that stand behind these
cars. Thank
you.
>> I Chair of the Committee.
My name is Scott Lopez. I
am a native
New Mexican from Espanola
and um
our family probably goes back eight or nine
generation
multiple uh
Lowrider
um our owners
and enthusiasts in our family.
And it would be an honor
to support this bill, the
economic development,
anything that is positive
in northern New Mexico, I support
especially in the valley.
And um you know,
it is a
cultural
uh
natural treasure of the
Lowrider community.
Both uh
had
a
um
in order to uh have this
uh museum go
forward.
>> Thank you. Do you have
anybody on
zoom?
Nobody. Questions from Committee
Members, Senator
Soul. Thank >> you madam
Chair and very much in support
of it. And similar to
when we did the aroma, your
comments about getting
international press
about this.
This is economic
development. This is, you know,
millions of dollars
of free
publicity for New
Mexico, New Mexico tourism
and, and such. And
unlike some of the others that
we've had through this Committee
where, you know, and
not to pick on it, but I've
never heard of this particular
song that we are
doing a winter song.
Everybody in New Mexico
knows writers. We are
noted for it. And
similar to when I had the Aroma
Bill, most people
would immediately go. Of
course, you know, that's
the one that it ought to be. It's
not something that's
obscure or
not known across the
State. So I, I fully support
it and I think it's a great
thing and tell me when you
get to do your interview with Scott
Simon on morning
edition or weekend
edition.
>> Thank you, Senator Senator
Sanchez. >> Thank you madam Chair
and Senator for bringing this bill. It's,
it, it's a unique bill.
I I all your bills I
think are pretty unique that you bring.
It's an honor to sit here and see
that we might have the low
rider for the New Mexico car.
Uh My favorite,
I have tons of favorite lowri
but one of the favorites. If you remember
the movie La Familia
1950 Mercury
chop top, Gangster
Visor. Candy Apple
red handle for the
doors on the bottom to open
amazing car. So it's
my say the only thing I
hope madam Chair and
center is that we don't have any
ev lowriders. We gotta keep
the
tradition.
So that's my two
cents insurance center. Thank
you for bringing the bill madam >> Chair. Well, I
do have to give this
tidbit of information.
Is Northern New Mexico
College is working on
ensuring that they can get
one
electric lowrider
car and they are gonna
train students on how to
build an electric lowrider
car in case it happens to
become part of an industry
standard that they then
would have mechanics
and car enthusiasts who
can then work on souping
up your electric
vehicle,
>> madam Sheriff's Senator,
they're gonna have to really. So if
you're hitting those switches, you ain't gonna
make it from Espanola to
Santa Fe.
>> I'm sure we'll stay plugged in while we're
hitting the switches. That's what we'll
do.
>> Is that an amendment?
No,
Senator
Shar,
any other questions,
Senator
Maestas? >> Thank you madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Jaramillo, Mr.
Otero. Thanks for driving up
and Gentlemen, Mr. Lopez,
the uh
the lowriders, you know,
back in the day, I love the
fact that Lowriders are
popular culture.
Uh because when I was a kid, there was
tension between like
the lowriders,
you know, the, the, the
rockers, the preps, whatever
he was like, do you assimilate
to be successful or do
you maintain
some cultural aspect?
And, and there's no contradiction in
doing both, you know, you can
be 100%
Chicano and 100% American and there's
no contradiction. That's, that's,
I'm really happy Mr. Otoro made
that point that, that
there's an A PD
police car
fully loaded,
that's a lowrider
in our city of Albuquerque, the,
the, the airport.
Um, so it's so it's great
that, um, and then what's
sad is all due
respect to the carmakers but
cars have no personality. They haven't
had personality for like the last
35 years, 40
years. But if you
can, there is a
particularized market for
19 fifties vehicles, 19
sixties vehicles.
Um There's
now computer
ability to find parts
from various
um uh
storage lots
and things of that nature. So we can literally
reduplicate these cars to the
best of our ability.
Uh because the,
the cars in the fifties and
sixties will
be in museums like 1000 years
from now. They're just so fantastic.
So, um and then, you know,
hopefully modified, you
know, for the environment and
all that good stuff. But anyway, I think it's,
it's really happy
that the Senator from Espo
is carrying this shout
out madam Chair to our
city council. My
district actually uh uh
go is on both sides of
West Central
and West Central was the cruising
capital back in the
day. It was actually, and then it was like
uh prohibited
by the city of Albuquerque
because of, you
know, there's
a frankly, there's
some police
philosophies that you want people
contained so you could manage it as
opposed to spread out. Anyway,
Clarissa actually brought it back
and changed the law to allow
cruising again, um,
which has had no problem
since. But
anyway, I support the bill and
really happy that, uh, we can
get some international,
uh,
uh, media
attention for our beloved
State. Thank you.
>> Thank you, Senator Maestas for
a second time. Senator Souls.
>> Thank you. I, I just want to help
with somebody to, to trick out
my little airplane, you know, in
Lowrider style, but
I, I'd love some help doing that.
That'd be cool.
>> I don't know if you
>> want. Um There's actually things that
are getting ready to go on inside the
airport. So whenever you're ready,
I got the people for you, we'll
candy it, we'll flake it out, we'll
pattern it might even throw
some datings on it. We got
you
>> madam Chair just, I wanted to add one
last thing is 60 minutes did
a, a special on low riding
and they came into Espanola
and the number of people that
then reached out to the county and the
city of Espanola asking
if the museum was ready to open
its doors. The amount
of publicity as Senator
Souls talked about highlighted
Lowrider culture. And
for years before leading up
to these generations,
people assimilated
Lowriders with a
negative subculture
of Gangsters or
drug-related crimes.
The low riding community has
changed that they've become
very committed to
community by helping with
clothes drives, food
drives and Espanola
the Loredo community is teaming
up with cooking with kids,
which is a program where
kids learn to cook a new
Mexican style dish
Lori community is bringing
stuff in like kale where
together they try new foods.
And so there's a positive
influence with lo riding community
throughout communities in New
Mexico.
>> I mov'e do
past
that way.
No.
Um
Before we um go
to the motion, is
there going to be the
perceive any
um Legislation
that about um
prohibiting
the height of speed
bumps?
>> That's a great question, madam
Chair. But we can, we've
been getting over speed bumps
in Espanola for generations.
They won't pose as a
problem.
>> Not only that, but we have
hydraulics. We,
we learn how to take it up side
by side and swing it on over.
So it's like it's like
the dance moving up, going
down.
>> Ok. Thank you. Senator. We
have a motion to do passed by
Senator Souls the second by
Senator Sanchez.
I need to please call the
roll.
>> Let's back
to
uh, send it to my
is
Senator Sanchez.
Senator
Share,
Senator Souls,
Senator
Pinto.
Uh There's a little
one.
Ok.
52
zero.
>> And you have a due pass
on Senate
bill.
Here's
agenda.
Senate bill
498.
Thank you.
>> Thank you madam Chair Members of the Committee.
And just quickly Senator
Pinto actually cruised
Espanola with me in
a procession of
lowriders in Espanola
after an interim Committee,
uh, tribal State and
City police officers shut
down the road so that the legislators
could take an official cruise in
the capital. Thank
you, madam
Chair,
>> the Senate and Rural Cultural
Affairs Committee will stand in recess
until
Thursday.
It was.
