All right.
Good morning and welcome
to Senate rules during
the interim
we're going to be
get started this morning as a
subcommittee
we have one more person here
will have a quorum
so wait to take any votes so we have
a quorum but we'll go ahead
and get started we're
gonna be doing that kind of an
ambitious
agenda
of conversations over the
next 2 days
there's kind of have
a a bunch of folks
built up so
some folks there their
terms are gonna expire before they
ever not confirm
so we want to take
the. The
relative luxury of the the
interim to to get
through a lot of
these and we're really
looking forward to hearing from
from folks today
I as we do it during
the session I'm
gonna hand the gavel over
to vice chair
senator Hermio
who chairs during
confirmations and
so he will take it
away
and just
for anyone who's watching
to the extent that there are folks
who their Senate sponsors
are able to be here today all
the filling in for them and
presenting those conferees
take it away vice
chair
of.
I do
that.
Madam.
Yes and so B.
because we were trying
to get through so many folks
are over these next
2 days we are
doing kind of
a. Deviated
version of public
comment where
we're have told Humphries
that they can have up to 3
people in support to
speak on their behalf for up to
2 minutes each and so we're
giving that same amount of time
and same amount of
time to folks who are speaking in
opposition
if everyone
actually takes that time
that all the other 12
minutes of call
of public comment age
that's about 4:00 hours of
public comment per
day so I
know that it sounds
it sounds brief
and.
Folks probably have a lot
to say on some people I
definitely encourage you to to come
talk to us at breaks and at lunch
and afterwards and I know
that we've gotten quite a bit of
a written copy
public comment especially
about the cabinet secretary who
we will be
having the hearing for
tomorrow
but I. Thank you
Senator Stewart for you're
right we should we should explain
why why we're taking that
approach to everyone
so I appreciate that with
that I'll hand it over to our
vice chair.
Thank you chairwoman do Hey good
morning everyone
and so we're gonna begin today on
the first item of the agenda
which is the unemployment
compensation review board
which is locked trunk going
to be introduced
by senator Ortiz the
payment Senator.
Thank you Mr
vice chairman and madam
chairman the it's my great
honor today to Sanchez
locked trong
for the recon
for her reconfirmation she's
actually been on this board
since 2003
she was appointed originally by
governor Richards and so
it's been it's been
quite a career that she
spent working on
that. It's
not unusual for her to be committed
that long she's she's worked for
the city for even longer
than that and is the
consummate human resources
professional at the
City of Albuquerque
she has
at various times assume
different roles within that
department and at
1.was the human resources
director for the city
under different administrations
that rules change but
she is always been the
go to person when anybody
in the city needed
information about human
resources the lock
graduated from Los Alamos
high school.
Senator how to be a representative
Los Alamos now so
you know even though he never roots
for the Hilltoppers it's still
nice to know that
you know he represents that
area.
And.
I can't think of anyone better
suited for this position and
looks as a masters in public
administration from UNM
she said she was actually a
teacher at 1.in her
career so she's
she's got a background that makes
for the perfect candidate for this
position with that Madam
chairman and Mr vice chairman
I'll turn it over to lock in later
see if you were it's about her interest
in this
position.
Good morning up
chair Senator Katie
do Hicks
vice chair senator
Leo Hermio.
And hello
friend Pat that I
introduce me to
her. And
I saw you in the newspaper
the. Yeah
and thank you
Senator
penal now
I would like to say the
the
greetings
to Senate
president pro tem
many Stewart
last because
when I first appointed
in 203
by the
late governor
Richardson you with the
1 you was
still with the
Albuquerque public
schools and you
stood up.
And made some
very
nice remarks about
me and
then Senator
Pino was my sponsor
and I always
remember but to
say maybe you
don't remember because you have
to do it for so
many individual
but I just remember
you very
vividly and clearly
when I was appointed
at the state
capitol.
And thank you so much
for.
Listening to
the accomplishment
the education that I
have.
In.
When I was appointed by
governor Richardson
I. I
was very honored
and still on
the today
appointed by the lake of
the new that is
being.
We got it very very
highly in our
entire
state.
I really enjoyed doing
it I've been serving in that
capacity in this capacity
for about.
Since 2 of 3
so we've done
a great
job
we work very well with
the team from the department
of workforce solutions
serve Under
Secretary
maybe 456
different secretary.
Of department of workforce
solution and currently
with said
Rita
who came
to the Department from the
City of Albuquerque
New chair
Senator Duhigg and I
spoke very briefly
about the and we
very we miss with
the city but we are
very happy that the
state is
able to
recruit to to serve in
that position and I
think that's all and
I have to say and I'm going
to save the time
and everything else
to of the members
that us.
Thank you so much for that now no one
did for in
support or opposition of the
country.
I'm so sorry to interrupt Mr
Mr so I think
folks were the folks
in support are just
arranging their own support
so I think they'll just let us know
if they have anyone and
then we were were
required to sign a
petition just whoever stands up
for something so there is
no one is that correct
okay very good with that I'll go to
questions from the committee
Senator Stewart.
Thank you Mr chairman thanks
so much for that lovely
creating I do remember
you.
But I
kind of want
to. I
want to hear a little bit
more about what
this unemployment
compensation review
board does I
I'm showing my ignorance
here but not
quite sure what you all
do and I'm and I'm just
really curious about
that.
The process
is look very
similar to this
we never never
appeared before
a.
Committee with all
the unemployment individual
appearing before us
we strictly
look at the
information provided
by
the
attorney from the department
of workforce solutions
and there are 2 of us
that are on the board
and we look at
all the issue and whether
they
submit that claim
timely or not
well with the it was
the night because
of some of the issue
we work with the
department of folks with
solution
I think now we called
general counsel
and then at that time we agree
among the 3 of us
we say yes or we say
no we don't
look at all of
the
unemployment claims
some claims that a very
routine and
they are really.
By the secretary of
the department of facilitation
only the one that seems
to be a little
bit.
Challenging that it
will quite 3 members
of the board this is a 3
member board one
is the general counsel
and the the 2 appointed
by the
government.
Thank you for that
Mr Chairman.
So so
how often do you need
and about how many people are
you claims are you
looking at can a
year
roughly.
Since I've been on the board
a little longer than other
people I can
say when I
started
we we
still meet
all of this only
twice a month.
Twice a month.
We usually would
go into a meeting that
3 of us will
exchange compensation
agree disagree
since COVID
in 2020
we've received the
information
online.
And then maybe a couple
of months we don't even
do some we go
in person and will
visit and we share
information
the I have to say
that the group
of attorneys that are
currently
working at the department of
workforce solution I
extremely
competent in
that's why you just seeing
the right the unemployment
insurance right.
Hey stop
drastically
because they really spend
a lot of time researching
and doing everything
that they need to do and
under the secretary
of the department of workforce
solutions she is
extremely
good in what she
what she gets.
Well Mr chairman that's
great to hear where we feel
very lucky to get street
a in that position
I worked with her for an entire
year on that paid family
medical leave act
she re wrote the bill
that we
presented.
And made it so much better
and just
perfectly designed
for the workforce solutions
department
so
so so the city's
laws the
state's game
a so so thank you for
that this is very interesting
to me and
I just want to commend
you for
wanting to continue this
is 20 years in
and you still want to do it and
that that is that says
a lot for your perseverance
your own perseverance and
and really appreciate you
wanting to
continue.
A Senator
Pino indicate that
that. I
have a student drive
in everything I
do.
I started out as an
English teacher.
From yes
ma'am get
certified
challenge myself
teaching at the high
school very
difficult position
successfully finish
that and move on
to the City of
Albuquerque
and I've been staying in
the department of human
resources all
these years they
have been very many
opportunity for me to
move into some of the
area but this is what
I do best
and translated
into what we
do at the department
of full court solution
you need someone with
the skills that I do
have because
that's what we do for a
living and we know
exactly what
is being done correctly
fund not meant correctly
we will support the
state as well
as the claimants
yes my position.
All right well it's just thrilling
to hear from you and thank
you for wanting to continue
with us thank you Mr
chairman thank you senator
chairwoman to
hit.
Thank you Mr
vice chair
and I want to echo
Senator us stores
concept thanking you for
being willing to to do this
for so long and and for continuing
to do it.
And and I'm also gonna kind
of expose my ignorance
here
I was just looking up the the
statutes that that you
guys go
under you said that
the the attorney from the
work department workforce solutions
provides the board with
information and you make your
decision based on
that.
Does the does the
claimants get to
submit
information to the board as
well the
need for yes.
Yes the claimant
of the claimants do
have that opportunity
and all the the
records in initiatives
that the records
we as a board member
and talking up
for me and the other one
in the.
James
Trenton
the one that serve with
me passed away about a
year ago and
so James Trenton
who was
with the department of workforce
solutions who was doing
that for a living
so we have 2 very
strong individuals serving
on the board
now.
You indicated that
I am not sure
exactly how the
records was
submitted to the
department
but based on
my understanding and
what I have done and
I've been serving all these
years the
department always
has a
general counsel
with the appointed or
classify I'm not so
sure things kind of
change.
But the other 2 members set
up appointed by the governor
the one that do that
now they
do.
Propose the information
and we go online we look
at that we have access to the
information and
then we agree we
disagree and we send it
back based
on
our.
Approval or disapproval
they will be sending that
to the claim in the state out
of 3 this is
approved to add of
3 approved
and that would move on
but if 2 out of
the one hour
ago then
it doesn't
pass.
Thank you I appreciate that
and and you might
not you might not know
this but
I saw that so if if the
claimant district
disagrees with whatever
the boards result as I
think they can appeal to do the kind
of arguing District Court
do you know how often that
happens.
You know that I'm
here that
information was not
kind of share with us
yeah we kind of left
out at that time
and and and that that doesn't
surprise me I didn't just to know if
you happen to know off the top of your
head but
yes thank you for your
service
yeah I think that like you
mentioned having you there
is this kind of continuity of
service
as these are
different secretaries are
coming and I think is is very
valuable and
and you are serving
for you said 1 of them
was I think
1 of the the the employee members
get paid to be there but you are
not you are you are doing
this for nothing but
for diem and mileage
74
mileage
I do not
claim but for
the basis
usually you ask
I don't know what that you or
Senate president president
asked
much.
I know that right
now we used to
look at more
right now cause the number
of cases have
reduced and
so sometime every 2
weeks we have
maybe
45.
We used to have maybe
1415
but now is reduced
to about 3033
percent so that that
these very very good
news. For
us we all act
we all take it very
seriously
I am on.
Do have been appointed by
the late governor
to be in this capacity
in the appointment was
very good
because I really use
like my skills and my
knowledge skill and
ability to really do it
and for which I'm very proud
to serve and I
also want to say we miss
you with the city
but.
You know diss
I really
enjoy what you with
that is.
City clerk
yes the band that you
had to.
Resigned.
With which you could keep that
that but maybe that is
doing a great job to
act he is he is
he is doing a fantastic double thank
you so much that that's all I have
Mister thank you
so much of Madam I just have a couple
of questions and then some comments but
the first one is do you
ever meet with the claimants
in person or you just
reviewing documents when you make
a
decision.
The answer is we never
never never meet
with anyone that and
that's the plan because
we don't have any
direct contact with
anybody.
And so and that makes sense I've I've
done some human resources work
at Los Alamos and sometimes
emotions get in the way
when you start working with people
one on one versus the facts and
documents not my I
only have to come in to get a clear the
record from Senator Ortiz Y.
Pino I do chair
on the Hilltoppers
as long as they're not playing the
Espanola valley high school
I. As I have
a problem this of this but you know let's
say you know you and I are rivals from
we act with you were in Los
Alamos thank you.
And so I'm super proud
of the way I graduated
from and I I
loved when you spoke to me about
the pride you have in Los Alamos
and the standards that they set that
we still see that today and
I want to thank you for 20 years of
service and for your
dedication to the people of New
Mexico and finding what's
right for those claimants I
want to thank you on behalf
of my Senate district
because I do hear from constituents
who have to go before the board
I want to thank you for the hard work and time
that you put into this yeah
thank you I just want to add one
more thing because I look
at the city when
ever there was
any claim
from the City of Albuquerque
employees.
I recuse never
never think do that even
if that in and if they
happen to be sending me
I'd say I week use
I knew we want to do
anything that would
create any issue
and concern
because we work for public
agency we need
to take this very
seriously in
each of us make
a contribution
to it so that would what
they will be in the issue
in the long run I appreciate
the comment that shows your ethics
and your standards and I thankful
for that any other questions
for the board. See
no questions we will be taking
a vote for now we're we're
working as a subcommittee
we will take a vote on your
confirmation once we get a full
court thank you so much for joining
us this morning.
Thank you so much for your time
and attention to
my visitation this
morning and Senate
to Pino
greatly
appreciated.
Thank you so much we're gonna move to the next
item on the agenda which is the board
of trustees of the New
Mexico museum of natural
history and science
Senator Stefanics will be
introducing her re
appointment
for it
suit brought that
and and I think
Mr chair we were thinking that
for these boards
that we would actually do
when there's board members here together
do them together
to kind of give us some
context about
how these words work
and.
So why can I'm awful
and for Senator Sedillo
Lopez but I
think we can all come up
and just do the whole board
more than one.
Then I'm also going to call a
doctor berry
hues to come and
join the
Senators in the front
that will do this as
joint questioning on the
board of trustees of the New Mexico
museum of natural history
sciences and we'll
start off with senator Senator
Stefanics will be
introducing the reappointment
of it soon
Baraka good morning
senator.
Good morning Mr chair
members of the committee I'm
going to introduce
this is distinguished gentleman
and I'm gonna rectus name
and then I'm gonna have him
speak per correctly
it I'm thinking it
might be Mr I set
aside to
Raqqa
Baraka because
fear.
Very close
okay so it's
in order
to.
But aka.
Because. Exits
are B. A. at
this.
Here yes
thank you very much for your
welcome thank
you.
My re appointment
a confirmation
of appointees
here is a
psycho genesis
geneticist
which I find very
interesting and very
relevant to this position
at the New Mexico museum of
natural history and
science and
he this is a
reappointment and
I would like to offer him the
opportunity to introduce
himself and say a few
words.
Thank you very much
Senator
once again my name is
is side to hi
exit out be a.
I am a site
geneticists.
At lab core which
used to be
vivid's in in
Santa Fe New Mexico
I have been in that
position for 11
years within
the last year I
have transitioned
into the
position of projects
specialist
so I am now responsible
for the
logistics of how the
specimens move
throughout the company.
My desired
to be on the board
came after I
was con
contacted by Diana
in the
department of cultural
affairs I
had done an art
piece that was
seen at forming
concept
and that is where
I per is quite the attention
of Diana who
contacted me
concerning the possibility
of being on this board
I was extremely excited
because.
I was born and raised
in New York and I remember
that one of my
most provide
school trips
was to the
museum of natural
history
in Manhattan.
And we would all get on
what we called the
cheese bus did
long
yellow
but
and it
really
solidified my
love of
science
is so much to the point
where I
decided to attend the
Bronx high school of
science in New
York and
continued on with my
science degree into
the university
of
Virginia union
university where
I obtained many scholarships
I've done internships
and I. H.
and
also
have moved down to Santa
Fe from New York
and obtained a
cytogenetics
certification.
So I have a duality
of art and
science and I feel that
science and
history are
paired
science influences
history in many ways in
history influences
science so when
I was approached to
be on the board I jumped
at the opportunity
to be part
of a
childhood memory
that I had growing up
in New York
and to see
that that
interest
is stimulated
in young kids
which is a good portion
of the
the
population it comes
through the
museum as well
as adults
because we all have
a kid within minutes
and science tends
to peak some of
that interest
thank you.
Thank you now head over to
Senator Duhigg chairwoman to
hate to introduce her
reappointment.
Thank you Mr chair
and I
am
introducing drive
very cues it's
pronounced keys he is
that he
is.
Well as someone would do his last
name
and.
And doctor keys
are is also here for
reappointment
doctor he's is
have a geologist who
has
service here
at UNM for
a long time
he's let's see
you started teaching here
back in
1974.
And went through
from us system professor
or through a full professor and
he is now and
emeritus professor
I he has
a great deal of
experience and things
that I can't
even pronounce I'll be
honest looking is
bio I'm sure
he will he will explain
to us he's
been really active in the New Mexico
geological society he
was there managing editor for
many years and their
president
he's an honorary lifetime
member he's
also
served as the
editor of New Mexico journal of
science and
in 2019
he received the earth science
achievement award from the New Mexico
bureau of geology and
mineral resources and I will
hand it over to Dr keys
to tell us a little bit more
about himself okay
thank you senator
I arrived in New Mexico in
1974.
After receiving my doctoral
degree and
took up a position as assistant
professor in
the department of geology at
the university of New
Mexico.
As a senator mentioned
I served on the
faculty in that
department for
37 years
until 2011
when I transitioned
into the Merida
status.
I'm a paleontologist
a study fossils
and have written
a lot of papers on a lot of
research on various
fossils many from
New Mexico.
Perhaps most pertinent to
this appointment
is the fact
is that as a young
faculty member
in 1977
all I with a couple of
colleagues and a bunch of
students we're
contracted by the bureau of
land management to do a
pale into logical
resource
assessment
in the badlands south
of Farmington
and we spent a summer basically
looking for an collecting
fossils
and found a lot
of neat things lot of
dinosaurs other
vertebrate fossils of
fossil forest
I could go on ad
nauseum and I yeah I I
won't but as a
result of the of
this a
movie
began
amongst
several people.
And and including
a couple senators at that
time John
I Rick and
lobby done
to explore the
possibility of establishing
and natural history museum
as a repository
for all these
wonderful fossel state
New Mexico has
but we're which were basically
going out of state because we
have no facilities
to
either curate them or use
them for educational purposes
within New
Mexico
so this movement gathered
force I
was a part of it
and served on 2
legislative
committees
in the late 19 seventies
that explored the possibility
of the New Mexico
museum of natural
history and
the actually served
on the first
what was then called the policy
advisory board
and the first museum
foundation
in the early 19
eighties after
the legislature and funded the
museum
museum opened in
1986.
And I've had
lots of contact with the
museum since
then I've
worked on various research
projects and even
help with some of their
displays
in the time since then
so my interest
in the natural history
museum
has been a long
standing
going back to even before it
existed
and.
When I was approached to as a
possible member
recently well from
past years
so to be on the
board of trustees
I was extremely
enthusiastic it's sort
of for me coming full
circle from the
beginning to
of something like 40
years later
so.
I'm not sure what else I should be saying
but if you have any questions I'll
be happy to answer them
thank you so much Dr Keith
any
questions.
Senator Stewart.
Thank you Mr chairman
so.
It's just so thrilling to
hear from both of
you your
background extensive
backgrounds I won't
even go to those
words that none of us can pronounce
so
so can you give us a
little flavor
of what happens
at the board of trustees
you know what kind of
what kind of work does
the board do
how often does it meet
who appointed you all assist
the governor appointee
of governor appointees
thanks so.
So I at
our I think
our museum of natural
history here in New
Mexico is really
stunning it's
an unbelievable news
and my brother in law
actually does tours
most days of the week in
Santa Fe and he says
that's the place that people want
to go the most and that's also
where they linger the
most and
so I'm just
thrilled with what we've done
but I I would like to get a
sense of what
your board of trustees
kind of does from
from both of
you.
From the meetings that I've been able
to attend
due to my due to
my work obligations
many times either
I'm not able to attend
Department tending to be as
soon
because of the location of
my work being in Santa
Fe from what
I've seen
is
the the board of trustees
is responsible
for giving
the head north
to different
exhibits different curation
of different
artifacts that will be
coming into the
museum
from basically around
the world and
to making sure
that those
artifacts that are coming
in fit within
the scope of
the mission
statement of the
museum
and all of the
listed logistics that
goes into that
space
timing of the release
of the of the
exhibit.
You know availability
of the resources
in order to
make the exhibit happened
and also a lot of
the project management
aspects of
the
cure racing
and
installation of
various
exhibits within the
museum the board of
trustees
gives they had not had
for for those to take
place.
Thank you ever shake your head
no.
I have been personally
come across anything that I
haven't agreed with
I've actually been
quite fascinated
at the scope
of what comes
into the museum
and from
from the
locales
that
that
these resources of sorts
from.
I would add that
in my experience
the board of trustees
interacts closely with
the executive director of the
museum
provides advice and
guidance of there's
a lot of interchange of information
in terms of a
possible
new exhibits or
possible new directions
for the museum to go
in terms of its educational
function
I have an experience it
first hand but I
gather that
the board of trustees
also
steps in if there are any
conflicts
in terms of policy
of that might come up
or or
problems that the
director perhaps the
executive director perhaps
needs assistance
with so we're
there is a very supportive
group
we provide guidance we
interact closely with the
museum foundation as
well in terms of their
fundraising activities
for the museum.
All right well thank you thank you
very much and thank you for
agreeing to be on
this board thank you Mr
chairman. Thank
you senator Senator Ortiz Y.
Pino.
Thank you thank you Mr
chairman and
thank you both for.
The service you've given and for being
willing to to continue doing
it.
Is it alright if I just call you order
to that a lot easier
for me thank you
Mr chairman and any order
to what kind of art do you do
and how does it tie in with
the the functions of the
natural history museum.
Well I'm a multi
disciplinary
artist the
specific peas
that.
I believe
court Diane
is.
I I was a part
of this and
exhibit at forming
concept in New
in Santa Fe
call the hand tools of
resilience
so basically in this
particular art
peas it was a
crocheted art
piece I crochet
and I also work with
metal and
glass so
the foundation of it
was
for one
of the of being
to be able to
use this particular art
piece to tap
into
information from
the past
to draw on
for future
usage for
future projects for
future knowledge
so it's quite elaborate without
going into too much of the
detail of the specific
pieces I
believe that
that is essentially
what we do at
the museum we
look at artifacts
from the past
in order to
bring it into a
presence goal
and allowing the viewer
of that are to
forecast of certain
future I do it for
themselves which
was the foundation of my
art peas
and I believe that's what
Diana's solo by
reading the bio of
the art peas and
we also with my scientific
background why I
would be a good fit for the
museum.
Thank you that's
very.
That explains very well why
why here are 10 years science
blend together so nicely at
the at the
trustees
and Mr chairman
I just have a comment or question
for the doctor Keyes
also I
noticed in that
long long list of
your of your published
works the
what I the only ones I was
interested in for the newspaper and
magazine articles
and I
remember.
Since I was a subscriber to
the New Mexico independent 2
and market cap on
helpless that
wonderful the
weekly
reading some of the pieces that
you had done back there in the in
the late seventies that was a long time
ago because he was he was
also fascinated with the
with the the the
the the the fossil
history of New Mexico and
and and
whenever you whenever you're piece
appeared the the you know it was given
prominence of I do
remember that very much thank you
are you still teaching
no I'm not when I
retired in
2011
I stopped teaching
continued with
reserves.
But also I found that
retirement.
Gave me time to pursue
other interests that
were outside of paleontology
New Mexico history is one of
the for example.
Well wonderful up
and Mr Chairman just one quick
question for you about the
trustees are there is
it now complete
the board or is there
still some vacancies on the
on the board of
trustees.
That I'm not sure of
I know that of
my particular appointment
was
obviously due to a vacancy
which took place about a year
ago and I believe it's the
same. And
so I believe I'm
not sure
to to say yes
or no.
Additional I see it and we're
getting there's still one vacancy
in the but the
the person who is also do
have been confirmed and is
not here Dr.
The went to
Soriano.
Is is
is you're not
counting her vacancy
okay. One
should be one of the
and and are we going to get to her later
or something or she can't
make it to the Mr chair
I believe she just couldn't make it today
so we'll probably get to her in
November she's in Los
crucis and we.
Well that's it Mr chairman thank you so
much I'm just impressed with the
caliber of the appointees
thank you and I don't have any
questions just a couple of comments
we thought to as a former
educator both Senator
Stewart and I can agree that to
know that you were stipulated
as a young child for the
interest with the field trip
about the ripple effect you're
having with your
work on this for it to get
other children
interested
is amazing to me and I want to
thank you for that I want to
thank you for incorporating arts
into stem right at steam
because our ties in
and I want to thank you for that as well
because I think having your
perspective on
ensuring that the arts are covered
with science education
is important when we reach our
children and when we start looking
at exhibits and so when
I thank you for that and Dr
keys if you happen to be my
professor in 1998 at
the university of New Mexico
I have also it wasn't
possible that you were teaching me
about I learned about dwarf
stars and supernovas the
where my earth and planetary
science professor and
I learned so much from you
so much in fact that I donated
some of my capital outlay to
you and tells for their
observatory because
they're gonna start working more on earth
and planetary sciences
and helping students from even Rio
Arriba County learn more
about the universe and I want to thank you
for sparking that in me
thank you for mentioning that I'm
always happy to hear I had
some influence on
thousands of students who went
through this is thank
you and with that at no further
questions from the committee we won't
be taking a vote since were still
functioning as a subcommittee
Senator Baca stepped out
for a moment when he comes
back into the room we will then take
that boat so thank you again gentlemen
for joining us and we'll be
seeing you again in just a
while.
Thanks for your introduction.
We're gonna move to the next item on our
agenda and Senator Stewart
and then Senator
Duhigg it's going to be you again
it's the state transportation
commission with Thomas
Taylor whose are conferee
you'll be stepping in for senator
Neville to introduce
Mr Taylor and
so whenever you're ready
the floor is
yours.
Thank you Mr chair
and
I'm
pleased to introduce our
Representative Taylor
who I believe served
with.
Public everyone but but you and I
Mr chair.
If they they could
probably do a far better
introduction than I
could.
But I will
but I
Mr Representative
Taylor has served in
elected office for 32 years
16 years of that was
spent in the house of
representatives and he was the minority
leader for 6 years
I he was on the
business administrative Canadian for
16 years on taxed
Representative for 12 years
and had 4 yes 4 year stint
on judiciary
he was also the more Farmington
for 12 years and on the city
council for another 4
years and he
organized the effort to construct
fiber optics in the 4 corners
area
areas in
1997
and he can probably it
has a long list of past
involvement here that
all I'll let
him him go
over but
all handed over to
Representative
Taylor.
Well.
Nice to be here today
the.
I haven't been before
committee in a
while.
Mr chair that's
correct.
Transportation commission
is an
interesting opportunity
for
me.
Ideas you know certain
legislation until
2014
when I retired from
that. And
it's hard to take your thumb off the
poles after that
long so I've
stayed involved with the
things locally as well as
some state issues along
the way
then this opportunity came
along.
I think it was in 19.
Or was it 20
high I do
remember after COVID
I I have a date
problem going backwards
so at any
rate we had
one meeting
that I that I went to and
Espanola and then since
then
we spent you know a year point 5
in on on zoom
meetings and then back
to where we are now.
Anyway it's a
the interesting thing about it is you
know when you're legislature you
deal with all these
various.
State departments
and their
needs and
and their
operations and all that
sort of thing it's really
interesting to to
move
down in the inside that
operational
more
you drive down highways
with an entirely different point
of view I had
no idea how many guard
rails are really smashed
and course I notice that
every bump crack
in the road now.
I was like to remind
people that
my district
district I.
If we made a one lane
highway would
go from Farmington
to just the other side of Berlin
Germany.
To put it into
perspective.
5300
miles.
A statewide I think we
have north of 30000
miles lane
miles.
It's a big responsibility
it's a huge budget of
course the
commission
main responsibility like
all of these commissions as
fiduciary.
To have a citizen
organization that
oversees the expenditure
and and direction
of of funding for those
departments that is
the actually the main
reason that these commissions
exist most all of them is
that is that one
thing and then of course below
that.
It's
getting no understanding
that. That
division of government
and how it
works and you know helping
and suggesting better ways to
do things and
and and that sort of
thing it's been
really difficult because
the governor
fired everybody on the
commission.
So we have no institutional
knowledge which is a little
difficult because
usually.
That's something you can't depend
on you know and I was elected mayor
back and I was a
child.
I had these ladies
and gentleman that had been there for
years and
so it was great to get a
historical perspective
on lions
and house on many
things and we kind
ever void if that at
this point I will
say that we have been
just recently we did a
full day
session
that was
great and familiarizing
us with every step of the
operation and how it
works
so that is helpful and course
along we continually
gain.
More knowledge about how that
process works
anyway I have a I thoroughly
enjoyed it you know it's fun
get to deal with irate
citizens now and
then most
of and for good reason
and and the
so anyway it's been very enjoyable at
this point.
Thank you Representative we're gonna
go to Senator Senator
Stefanics.
Thank you very much Mr chair
and thank you madam chair
for presenting Representative
Taylor
Representative Taylor in
the past
I represent parts of 6
counties and so
I've seen of
a great need for some
highway work and I've
seen
some plans for
highway work that local
communities have
opposed.
And I think that
that's
an issue for the
highway commission
that transportation commission
that of
you might have the opportunity
to receive federal funds
to match with our state
funds to do big
projects but then you
will have a divided community
come in front of you.
An example of this
is
I 25 in the Santa Fe
area.
Years ago
when senator Rehman
mace head that was
sat on the
commission.
We had some federal money that would
have created a highway
exit and I. 25
exit on to
Richard Avenue which
goes to
this community college
so the community was
very divided.
And I have a commission said if
you don't want the money we're not going to put it
there.
So we
also have in my
district
the widening
of.
State road high
or highway 41
going down from
let me through
gal stale 1440
now now 1441
we're expanding it
that community
wanted to try to stop all
trucks going through
this familiar with then
we have another 1
of 380 down in
Lincoln County.
Where some people want to widen
the road but we have
some buildings in
Lincoln that are
historic
and wider road
in rumbling of more trucks
would actually debilitate
the buildings so you
will come across some of
these and I'm just
wondering.
How you will if
you personally will resolve
community.
Divisiveness about
projects well
those are always interesting we
play a role in that we've
not had any real
direct.
Involvement as a commission with
those things I have
within my district
is it for you Torrance as
well.
And her all over the place
of.
6 County Board.
Next year to 4 counties I
see
the.
You know course Torrance's
part of my district and it goes
south of I. 25 it's
a to a
large areas so there a lot of the
different issues that go on
in
there.
In our money
can't remember the community all the
sudden.
Gosh Representative McQueen
I think well
scale staff.
Yes
yes
yes.
We also.
Carrying.
Rate well we had a problem
tier we improved highway that
made everybody go faster
and self.
So now there's a speeding
problem
I know how to fix a speeding problem
it's. Simply
put in around about
but.
You know signs
can.
Can you can you
can narrow the road you can put
bumps in and everything else you can
still go 100 miles an hour
through it. What
about you have to slow down
but anyway there are
there are solutions to those
kinds of problems and it's
difficult especially in those
areas New Mexico Oregon
long straight flat roads
and it's just pretty hard
to maintain your speed and
so the problem is when
you come to one of the small
communities
coming up with ways to slow
it down
it.
You we need to be involved
in those sorts of things to to
help with
that.
That's the the main one
that I can think about the like to
the course and the other thing about
trucks not going
through.
That area on
home or is it
gas service.
In that area and.
Yeah mentored.
You know it's very narrow road
and.
I'm not sure that I don't think
there's a lot of truck traffic
on.
But.
You know we recently put roundabouts
on main street Farmington.
And so
we re directed
trucks to the truck route
because it's difficult for a
45 foot trailer I mean it
goes straight
through.
Reasonably but if you decide to
make a turn on one of those
things it requires
very good driver to do
that
and
we have signs a yellow
flashing lights and
everything else and it
took it
took us 6 months
and several
$500 fines
and local sorts of things
to get them to realize that was a
problem of course part of the
problem is is now.
Drivers tend to be looking at their
guidance
on.
And as a
result they're not paying that much
attention to the road and it
takes a while when new
things like that happen have minute
grated into the system.
And so I
think those 2 things kind of play
together but
there are ways to solve those
problems and
and it's important to talk
about.
Thank you and Senators before I go to
any more questions I fails
to notice that there's some
support in the room
and so the cabinet
secretary are you here in support of the
country.
Thank you Mr chair members
up if you'd like to come up
and then
speak into the
Mike and is there
anybody else who comes in support of
the country okay
seeing that good
morning cabinet secretaries thanks for
joining us good morning I think
Mr chair thank you members of the
committee thank
you
I've been working with commissioner Taylor
for the past year he he
was on the commission Andrew when I
arrived
and
all 6 of them approve into
agreeing to a different
taste right
experiences
understanding of their communities
regions and districts that
especially even you are
our new commissioner
of commissioner Tom Jeez
who I mentioned you'll you'll you'll be
meeting sometime soon
who's especially driving the need
for us to really re visit the roles
and responsibilities of the commission as
commissioner Taylor said we
spent an
entire day really helping
them understand how they
dive deeper into what
we do from a policy perspective
right from
policies that govern
how we design roads how
we build roads and
essentially how we prioritize
the funding on the projects
across the board
so you
understand his experience as a
legislator as a
policy maker as a community
leader he asks
the right questions which is what
is the impact how does this fit into the
big picture how does this
help us address our long term
plan for infrastructure in the state of New
Mexico and then of
course throughout the course of the
legislative session
helping us determine
you know how we can better maximize that
resource of it's been a pleasure
other for to working with him and
I appreciate your support
not only of course in in this
instance but for the other members that
I know will be come before the committee
thank you thank you for those comments
cabinet secretary we're gonna
go back to questioning and I'm
gonna head over to Senator
Stewart.
Thank you Mr chairman so
that the CEO
had served for many
years your their
16 I guess so I was
there the entire time you were
there I believe
yes so
at 1.you and set
behind me on the floor
and then we really had fun
yeah that is so
I can tell all kinds of
stories I'll
just tell if you
of course we require
everyone all the
gentleman on the floor
of the house to wear
ties up
frequently
Representative Taylor
came in with a tie
that was a little questionable
maybe from the Sunday
comics.
Made from other
things perhaps won't
go the
unmentionable
it was quite fun to see
how we were going to start the
day with
him such a
great sense of humor
such a wonderful
attitude about
life in general
so he's
really 8 a well
liked Representative
so I can understand
why that secretary
srna enjoys
having him on the commission
so but I do
have a couple of questions and
that is so
are all 6
spots now filled
on the commission yes
so how many of
those spots have been
confirmed yet
perhaps the secretary
might note
that.
Managers and all the for
over 2 of
the state here in New Mexico has the
fact
that.
Secretary and Senator
Stewart. New
Mexico
Representative.
Okay so they're they're
they've all been referred to
us at this
point
and I believe
that.
Some of them the new Senate
messages letters because
they're trafficking were serving
have the fire on the
regional center
that.
And then if you have one new
member group messages and
get on top.
Okay.
So I guess for this
commission they
just merrily serve even
though they haven't been confirmed
assessed what works Representative
Taylor Mr madam
this.
All right
I'm reading these books are so
handy because this is the
inventory of our
executive secretary
executive boards and commissions
so you have a lot of
power.
In this mission
according to the
statute.
You actually have
control over the
expenditure of the state road
fund.
You determine
all policy for
the department transportation
that's kind of.
That's that's a lot that's
bit
so.
Secretary certain there
so the so this
is kind of your
your your board of
telling you what to do is
submit
Senator it is
having being you
are higher at program
reviews you could be created
with the board of regents for
example from the
approval of the budget prior to
submission policy
yes absolutely.
Well I feel good about Representative
Taylor being part of
that group so
at so thank you
for that comment because
the.
You know this is this is
a lot of money and a
lot of work and a
huge job
to ensure that we
have good transportation in the
state so.
This to me is is a
huge deal but
what you have to do
so I'll
now talk about
some personal issues
that I have and that
is up we've
taken several
years and
we have for thoroughly
study that partner
transportation game and
fish have really
studied where we're
killing animals are those
animals are killing
us because
we are just taking over
everyone's habitat
**** nilly we care
not so
we are now
have a
good solid
700 page
plan to
address the wildlife
quarter issues that we
have in New Mexico
and every other western
state I
think they're much further
loan Colorado
they're further along in
Arizona
we really have just sort
of started dealing
with you know can
we provide a
habitat can we find
a way to ensure
that especially the big
game we have all kinds
of other things all that big
game have a
way to ensure
they've got to have tax we don't
want them out like we
wiped out 1000000
other species
by taking away
their habitat sorry
to be this
intense about it but that's
the reality
so I'm hoping
that you all will help
permit transportation and
came and said this to
move forward on
this well thought out
plan to ensure
that we can put these wildlife
quarters all over there
and where they're needed in
this state we have a
Levin projects
outlined a number
one is that Cuba
area where we we
kill most of the animals
and we get most of the
damage to life
and cars
so please
tell me that you know what I'm talking
about your fully onboarding
you're ready to move
forward
slowly go. And
forward with wildlife
borders from.
Well Mister chairman Senator
very aware of that
project.
I have only
hit 2 deer in my
life. And
fortunately both of them
survived.
That you know
well no I know
it because by the time
I contacted them
I was moving it maybe a
mile an hour
enough not come
over.
Seattle had come up above
this.
Okay.
And learn to aim
for their but
and generally they're not
there when you get there but
and then the rest of the herd shows
up anyway it is
definitely a a difficult
problem.
We're behind Arizona and
Colorado and
a lot of people in the nation for
one main
reason hi.
I just got back from Germany
which is about the same size
New Mexico it's larger
for 90000000 people
there.
So you can find a heck of a lot of
transportation with that kind of
a tax base
then you come to New Mexico
2000000 people in
them
area.
It's it's like the 4 corners
cycle at the state of as
in New Mexico.
As the 4 corners area were
all **** children of
the states that were
members of the metropolitan
areas hundreds of miles
away and
and it you know just like from
Farmington to
here you go through
Cuba and it's
160 miles
on it it's very
very difficult.
To fund that sort of thing and then of
course those are open
areas where you have
lots of wild
animals
they've worked very
hard
getting the area south of
Cuba taking care
of.
The portion on the north has
a different problem evidently
L. don't like to go through
tunnels.
So they have to do over passes
for LFC
a recently finished one in Colorado
just north of us
near the ghost of
springs
but very supportive of that
project you know
its
it's kind of terrifying when all of a
sudden you've got animals coming
across the road
in
especially at night when you
can't you know when you don't have
a lot of side vision
going on so it's a
definitely a program our sport
very much.
Ways to make that to
accessible.
Hello thank you for that
Mr
Chairman.
So we did a little a
field trip
north of Cuba a few
weeks ago with
department transportation and
game and fish to
see
where they have a problem
with those tunnels
that the LFC won't go through
because they're filled with dirt
and garbage and
logs and trees
and bushes
you can barely see light
through them so
they're taking those away and
putting a structure
designed as an
under pass and then we
got to see the place where
they're going to do an overpass
with to
outcroppings right
kind of at the top of the hill
where we're standing there and those
cars for I swear to god they
were going 0 miles of that
region
you know you had to we had all
aware of this because
it was kind of terrifying
how fast that track
the goes
there
so Senator roundabout
we're going to put an
overpass
so it's just thrilling
to see all this
expertise and work
that's gone into it
and I've already got the governor
to promise me
it pretty big chunk of
funds there are now
so many
grants available from the
federal government for wildlife
quarters and
wildlife impacts
so I
appreciate you all
being fully fully in
support of that and and we'll
come up with the money.
We will with
5000000000 in new money
this year I aim
to get a little chunk of that
per well at our
fate thank you Mr
secretary just hard for me to even
relate to it we
can't relate 20 third
9000000000.
Thank you senator Senator Ortiz
the people.
Thank you Mr chairman and
and thank you Representative
Taylor it's good to see you
against a
been going to carefully through
your mature you
submitted and have
some pretty strong questions
for you about it.
Do you have against bananas.
I just don't like
him.
My mom told me that when I
was.
Before communication
age. That
she'd feed mashed up
banana and I'd scrape it
off on my
gum I just leave it until she
removed it.
From from your earliest the
ramifications you didn't like Matt
and I can detect it at
about one part per 0
in a fruit
salad.
Phil I guess you
we can argue with K.
so yeah I'll
let you go on that one what
do you have against campaigns
campaigns such as he
campaigns.
You've reached a few I
notice. You
know I've been through a
few.
You know the difficulty
that I finding campaigns
is that and now
they're
just.
Any just gets worse all
the time.
Basically at this
point in my life I think the
Democrat Republican parties
have collectively to store the
integrity of every
elected official in the U.
S..
It is just interesting how
we we even have
laws
you know with the with the
packs were you
can't spend money supporting a
candidate because in one big money
electing anybody sold
billions of dollars
in negative campaigning.
And underneath
that it really does
destroy people's integrity
and people's trust
in government you know when they take
those
national.
Of polls about you
know.
Your support of
Congress for instance it
is below 10
percent.
In people tend
support there are
Representative but everybody else
I think's creek
and.
What else can you think when that's
all here for months
and months on end
previous 2
elections.
There that's part of my just
just the corrosive effects
of money yes
on on election Kenya
politics.
You left off something that I was
assuming that would provide on your
list of stuff you do like to
do. And
that is I looked at it
and see if maybe I'm.
I mean these are all great things that you
like to do a problem
solving and
bonsai driving your
questions but
I remember you
doing these incredible
intricate
sketches and doodles
during legislative
hearings.
Have you given up your your
your your drawing and
sketching and graphic
work.
That was something to keep my
hands busy
during. On
the fate
this
is no I haven't I
still
still.
Do some sketching and that sort of
thing on the.
Got a little bit
of. Order
it that sort of thing
it's really
it's really a lot of fun
we were very good
really thoroughly enjoyed
watching you would do that and then
looking at the finished
product speaking of
Pickett of this product he
didn't show them around
much.
I'm on a
more serious note Mr chairman
the the issue
is at the highway department
for a longer department transportation
has been funding and
the decline in the federal
of.
Availability of federal funds
and the state road tax
also going down as
as as
the cars have better
mileage and we collect the
mileage on gas
has there been any talk about
changing the basis for
how we collect that tax
I know they've been suggestions
over the years for different approaches
than just per gallon
tax Mr
chair and senator I
don't think we've had a
direct.
Conversation on the commission
about that I know
that it's
been a concern of mine for
many years
it's kind of a weird way to
tax
to tax fuel.
And especially with the
electric cars coming in on the
hybrids and
you know some of those
getting 5060
miles to the gallon
at this point and of
course electric cars are not
paying any.
And.
And in fact there are
heavier.
In probably do more road damage
and the other one so we're gonna have to
rethink how we
do that not
sure.
How it works it's
a. It's
difficult it's like during legislative
years I think.
I had just short of
370000
miles.
That I drove in that 16
years.
Went to 5
automobiles.
Of course I paid for
fuel and I pay tax
that way but
compared to somebody who doesn't
drive hardly at all
and the problem there is
is
that.
The roads are there for everybody
whether you use them or
not.
You know in cities and paving
districts or you know if
you own a piece property had a role
in front of you got to pay for a piece
of it.
But the difficulty with New
Mexico again is the
size of the state
you know right now
I would say the most
critical problems we
have.
In New Mexico highway
system is on
40.
That thing needs to be a 6
lane from
border to border.
It it it
really requires a
lot of attention
driving that road.
And at night it is
just. Our
State of
semis.
Just super dangerous and it
really does need to be
done but you know all
the figures on that are just
getting crazy
we have roads
that.
We used to figure $1000000
a mile now we're seeing
3 4000000 a
mile
just just
incredible makes
it extremely difficult
again because
of the length of
an. In with
the roads that we have to deal
with and you in New
Mexico.
And and Mr chairman that
that is part of the
interstate federal highway
system right you you
hope that Congress would step
up and figure out a way to
help out of state like New Mexico
which has so much of
it.
As this responsibility
so I would I would
hope it. As
time goes on the commission would give
us some ideas for things
that. We might
change in the way of of
of how we finance our
roads and and move away from
the field taxes is
the key component
of that
I always look at
these big semis that go by
with a little thing of this truck
pays.
$117000
a year in a row taxes and
I was under my breath say
yeah but it destroys
$500000 worth of
highways of the goes.
So.
Yeah Mr chair and senator
I have heard the statistic
that one semi
loaded is equal
to 30000
cars.
Going over the
road.
It's I mean it's tough when you are
that much weight on so
I mean we're basically paying
Mr chairman for
the transportation
system that brings merchandise
from California to Chicago and
back and forth and
and the it's
great I mean they do stop
occasionally and and and
buy a Cup of coffee or something
but.
That's a huge burden and and
it means would you travel to
Gallup you're you're
you got to be alert you can
you cannot take your eye
off the of the road
for a second many have
thank you thank you Mr
chair representative
thank you senator and Melissa
you wanted to make a comment if you can come
up and turn on the bike if you don't
mind.
Thank you Senator vice chair I just
wanted to correct my response
to Senator Stewart
are regarding how many members have been
confirmed of the
6 members 3 have been
confirmed Representative
Taylor makes for we have
to that still require
confirmation and we have 2 that
are going to be coming forward for
reconfirmation
and if it pleases the committee moving
forward starting in November I'm happy
to provide rosters for you in your
packet so that you have that
information prior.
Okay thank you thank
you so much for that and so I
just have a comments I think your
experience Representative
serves you well as a commissioner
on this board and the 3
short years I've been in the
sea I can tell you that
roads with
NMDOT becomes one of the
top priorities in rural New
Mexico as a matter of
fact Senator
Ortiz Y. Pino and I were in
Dixon yesterday for
a conversation
with the congresswoman
and there were a number of issues
that were centered around
a state roads and
highways and so your job
isn't an easy one because I know it's
on everybody's
radar
we've been heard from a constituent
who asked for every dirt
road to be
paved.
With us those.
Because of the 0 and we
know that a lot of them are far fetched
but a lot of them are true so we
heard from constituents that talked
about the threat of speeders
just the way Senator
Stewart talked about coming into
place as likely going on
that which now has
a brewery and
winery traffic
speeding by going over 65
miles an hour with people trying to cross
the road we heard
from issues of backed up
culverts
so you might be hearing
from me and seeing how maybe
you can help us and Senate
district I so with that there's
no one no other questions
were still functioning as a subcommittee
representative so we're not gonna
be taking a vote just yet until
we have at least one other members
show up I want to thank you for
your time this morning thank
you thank you
Representative we're now going to
move to the next item on the
agenda which is the New Mexico
mortgage finance
authority.

supplying industrial
fabrics and components
to a wide range of industries
of southwest operations director

and he
during that time he was elected to
the executive committee as an
advisor to the chairman
and he's a avid
golfer and boxer in
books yes and
all all handed over
to Mr Sierra to
to tell us more.
Good morning thank you for
having me this
morning.
As my bio
reads I've been
actively involved in this on but
that is area since
1992.
Primarily with acme
mills
suppliers of industrial
textiles so
you said almost every day
it's everything you don't see in
a car seat.
And we support our
suppliers to the Micaela
industry New Mexico
and throughout
Europe
international but
primarily Mexico from the cell
to tennis
area.
This is been out there since
92 when the second
longest tender plant
manager in the
area only
be not by Mr
Steve Ortiz over it's
still rejects.
And so we've been out there
working together for
all this time 32
years watching the
area
grow.
My interests are in
in the border Development
not just a long something that just
about Columbus
and antelope wells as
well. I'd like
to see some.
Diverse things happen out
there.
I think well maybe
we're due for an RV park out
there take some business from
Arizona.
And that would help bring
some business down I 25
and into the
boot hill
area.
Very good any questions
from the committee Senator Ortiz
Y. Pino.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
Mr 0
thank you senator purpose sponsoring
and this is here for being
willing to serve to use
your experience on the border with
the with the authority this
is a new appointment to have not
served on the border Authority before
actually I've served on the board
for the last 3 years
we just 7 confirmed need it
that's not in person I did
do one over soon the
first year 3
years ago.
During the epidemic yeah
so. Yeah
I thought that I thought we had that's what
I have wondered what was
not listed as a reappointment because
I I do remember your background
so
so my questions for you have to
do with the first
of all I I like your idea
of a our report I I
remember when when
for some reason I went down to
Columbus at
1.at
the punch will be a state park
there there is an RV
park that is
the single
busiest.
Of the tourist
facility in the state of New
Mexico for
6 months of the year
because of the snowbirds that
come down and
visibility.
I mean it just
struck me my
god who who knew this was
going on you're going to be a state
park and it was actually
gems as with people from
Wisconsin and
Minnesota I
don't know can up the
yes spending
the whole winter there
and
so I I mean I think that's
absolutely a great
idea and and you
know whatever we can do to
to faster that I think
would be useful
in and generating
additional revenue for the state
what other ideas Mr
Chairman and Mr
seer do you have
about ways in which the state
could be supportive of
what's going on in
the economic development
of the.
Border area.
Well there's a laundry
list there's
the top 12 project
it's.
That the Mr Dr heather
has currently
he's the executive officer
of the border Authority
primarily dealing with
infrastructure.
Needs that we have
there's a new highway
that we're I believe we're
fully funded for that
highway that'll run from
something that is a.
Through.
East and connect
with Texas at their
loop
375
I should also mention that I sat
on the.
6 sigma Committee
for the city of
pasos
bridges and highways.
So I get
a lot of information then
we have it going back and forth
working with their MPO
so that the.
We can share that information
and and work
together to make good
things happen out
there
that's one the water tower
for the creating a.
A utility out there for the
water
in addition to that
highway there's
the Senator
diminishing highway that
runs from the port
to interstate 10 in
pasal it's
in the now of several
overpasses.
There's several ground
level grade
level.
Crossing intersections
that are like controlled
but you have
96000 pound trucks
coming down the hill
they don't always stop at a
light. It
is so we've got some
dangerous situations are at
times that we'd like to
see the overpasses built
there and the
so that the that traffic
can carry on without
stopping in Texas
is in the process
of.
Of putting in flyovers
at the
interstate.
Because you have a 56
like wait there now with the truck
traffic from something that
is.
So they're going to remove
the other
gonna include flyovers
for both eastbound and
westbound I. 10
traffic coming from something
that is so that's a good
move on their part they're
starting to work on that but
if we can include
those overpasses
that would be great
the. Good for
the state and make that
highways safer for both
New Mexicans and
Texans.
Great well thank you thank
you very much for
for.
And and and just a
reminder to keep
us posted on things that that are
needed because you
know we just
Senator Stuart mentioned
there is some money available this
year so we us we'll
put it to good use and
and and take care of some
needs that will save us
money in the long run and generate
more money in the long run thank
you we'll be back to see in
January.
Thank you Senator
Stefanics.
Thank you very much and thank you
for serving already
in this capacity
we used to have
a.
A border Health
Commission.
Does your border Authority
ever discuss health
issues across the
border.
I'm gonna say yes we do
well we work
with.
And I'm not sure it was from the border
Health Commission
but there was an office that we
did set up inside the border
Authority building.
During the
pandemic.
That was working to
immunize
the.
Truckers.
Making sure that both
US and Mexican
truckers were
immunized.
And cared for during the
pandemic.
And I know Margo was instrumental
in helping them set
up in there.
Well Mister chair this is
a a long
standing many many year
effort
D. O. H. and the
governor's office usually appoint
somebody to participate
with our neighboring states
New Mexico and
the federal government has a
component of it but
they often times
brought up
issues that could
be collaborated
with the various
states then
so
you might take that back
to the border Authority to see
if they could scrounge up
some pass minutes through
see how it might interface
with current work thank you for that
yes I will get with
the with our
chairman Sir DELLOSO
and with Markle got ahead of
the XO
so Mr chair it
seems that it's mostly
economic development right now
is that
correct.
Well infrastructure needs
is really what the focus is
not so much economic development
it's a it's already
there the Economic in
something that is it'll soon
be in Columbus
because in Columbus we did
some flood
control projects
that have are being completed
and that's going to open up quite
a bit a land for
development
industrial
development.
So that.
Yes the economic development so
already happening we need to catch
up a little bit with the
infrastructure.
And.
And we can while
working with the
primarily right now with what
is. On
the amendment extending
some of their highways
up to the highway the
the cell can only more highway
that comes to the
border.
So that will alleviate
some of the traffic and
what is own the Texas
bridges and bring them through
New Mexico.
Great thank you very much Mr
chair thank you Senator
Stewart.
Thank you Mr chairman
thank you very much for
your service so far
and for wanting to continue
this.
I just have a question about
some of the economic development
activity that's going on
down there already so
and I might have that
information
so it's my
understanding that
there's actually a
Taiwanese chip
chip manufacture
that is interested
in opening a business
down there or if
they've already done
but that they're in
conversations with
us and the governor
about having
a chip manufacturing plant
down there it's time one
needs to know anything about
that hi 2 there
are several Taiwanese
companies already in
the something to this area
and looking to move out
to they're looking for land
so they want their building so
out to the Columbus area as
well.
I know the state has
a a trade
office in
Taiwan.
That's headed up by economic
development.
I'm not aware of a
specific chip
manufacture
but if they haven't
signed anything yet
maybe they're still in
negotiations.
We wouldn't really know about
it at least I
wouldn't right
at my
level.
But I wouldn't be surprised to
hear and see that
when those come in.
So Mister chair Mister
she had a what so what
companies do they have
now of the
Taiwanese in
center us move
next door neighbors Symmetrix
is
they are label
manufacturer barcode
labels and print
labels.
There is a new one at
a little table.
That they make of
the cabling and extension
cords.
For lamps fluorescent
type lamps or LED type
plans
and
I know there several more in the
works but I don't
know exactly what they do
at least 3 more
reserves 0
square feet of building
being built right
now. In
the new industrial
parks.
Well okay well that's
exciting yes.
Great to see lots of
activity this
well thank you Mr chairman thank
you for your service on their you
sound like a good person to be
juggling all of this we want
to hear what you have to
ask for in January
okay great will
bring it up thank you
senator so Mister Sierra
I'm just wondering is there
it's my assumption that there's the border
Authority south of the border
that you collaborate with.
Actually it's a municipalities
of waters
and the state of to what
will. That we
deal with most directly
and their economic development
teams okay
and so it currently are you
collaborating with any other projects
other than them working on those infrastructure
of of roads coming over to
Columbus is there any other
partnership that you're
doing.
At the time none that I'm aware
of what maybe one
there is one.
That we're looking at
a. There's 2
or 3 systems
that have been developed
by several universities
to track the timing to
cross the.
The cross
support
using.
Our FY Deezer honor
phone that's not
personally
identifiable but it does
track your
phone and how
long it's
taking.
And there's some
satellite
like.
The GPS
that can also track
so there's several different projects
at the.
That we're looking at
to try to track the timing
to give that information out
to the community.
So that they can they
can plan the routes it
was the best time and work with
CBP
to get the trucks through
I have to give a shout out to
the local board
director that.
They were very closely with the
business community to make
sure at both point
Columbus and something that is
a. Suit
that the trucks are not
unnecessarily
delayed.
But they are thoroughly
inspected.
And the that
that's a really
good the
accolade for us out in the
community that there's
not a a long excessive
weight time for
trucks to get through
and Mr Sierra my last question
is what do you find is the
biggest issue you
face on
this border
Authority is
there a a hurdle that you have to
try to get through or.
Something that makes it difficult to
serve.
Because it's dealing
with the state
sometimes
there is there's that
Mason Dixon line if you will
that's a south Albuquerque
the state doesn't
exist
I'd like to see that change a little
more.
The you know we are power
has down there we contribute
almost a billion dollars a year
just part of something that just I
contributes almost
$1000000000
to the state.
So.
I appreciate that comment Mr speaker
thank you so much I'm
seeing no further questions
or comments from the committee Mr
Sierra we are
functioning as a subcommittee right
now which means we can't
take a vote until we have at
least one more member show
up so we'll be taking
the vote on your confirmation
once we have another Senator
joined the
committee today I want to thank
you for taking the time and being here
I look forward to working with you and seeing
your list that you comprise of in
January to send
over to S. T. okay the
current thank you so
much thank you all very
much.
Okay.
This.
So I'm going to go to the next
order of business on
the agenda which is the New
Mexico mortgage finance
authority about how
widespread is joining us as a
reappointment
in
Senator Rodriguez isn't
here today so Senator
chairwoman do hate
will be
introducing the conferee
so when you're ready we'll with the
senator say a few words and then you
can also say some words yourself
back
up.
In thank you
Mr chair
Vectorworks burger
is former
city councilor and mayor pro
tem for the City of Santa
Fe and she's been
very involved in
creating Santa fe's on
economic development
plans with a
focus on cultural arts and
tourism and the development
of the Civic
Center
she and I should call you I
don't know if this point counselor
or
doctor.
I'm no longer famous
this.
But she she has a her
her PhD in public
administration from
the university of southern
California and
over 30 years of
experience in
strategic planning and
managing complex
projects at the local state
and federal levels and I
will hand it over to
use tell us a little bit more about
yourself.
Hi.
So.
Well.
First of all I am very
grateful to have this
opportunity
because my
priority in my life right now
as has been for many
years not
only does public policy but it's
particularly affordable
housing and I can
talk some about
that.
I began my career as a
developer of many developers
I called it in
Los Angeles and
started building my
first homes for first home
buyers as a many
developer and then
at that point really
learned
the nuts and bolts of
the cost of construction
but my more
important work
began when I moved to New
Mexico.
And that's when I first got involved
habitat for humanity
and this came the construction
manager and
of we've built I
adobe homes because I
thought it was very
important what I was seeing
that no one
unless they were well they could afford
it over it which didn't seem to make
sense we wanted to be
machine and
build the bricks with volunteers
and did I homes and those
homes are still standing in
on west Alameda.
To go backwards in
time
my real passion is basically
because I didn't
realize it until I
was much older that I was
actually homeless
I'm a product of
Mississippi
single mom whose dad
left on calling dad
with 3 daughters and she had an
eighth grade education.
And no work and
but we didn't really realize that
never had the word homeless and because she
slept with you know you're
at your aunt's house so you would
rent to house and then
you'd be kicked out so
but is a long time before I remember that
because I moved on
through education
as you mentioned I have Ph.
D I have 2 masters
degrees and a
bachelor of arts and master's degree
from Washington version Saint
Louis Herrera I
didn't realize you had to have tuition
I mean had tuition but you didn't have
room board so my
perspective I feel like this a
lot this in common
from my experience that I didn't
recognize for many
years and was lucky
and blessed to.
Move forward in the
world and to move
from Mississippi and
for California to
New Mexico
there's just so much in common
so
in terms of the needs and in
terms I think also the
opportunities
what I want to know how much how long
you want me to
talk.
21 here you
would ask me questions I could go
on we're also going to be asking
you okay well I think was who
would also and tell you
that so
for the past I've been here
in New Mexico for 30
years
and
just even where I started
I have never I've been fortunate
enough in my life to
not I mean I I
work but that is not the
money is not the job I've always been
able to focus on
the kinds of issues
emerging issues a
state that affect public policy
or particular issues
like housing
and affordability which
which I've done
here.
But so indeed so
once I got to Santa
Fe I do a judge about
habitat I did became
what I've always use my
my business I
used I'd my business is
been consulting
and strategic planning but then
also formally merry
to an architect and
I became and just I keep calling many
developers going to small
projects and one
by one which I think is a role
model by the way for what
we ought to be doing in addition
to the massive projects that we
do that take 5.5 years or
7 but we can talk about
that you care
so I've done that for the past
15 years and
over time my construction
experience has varied
from commercial
buildings
reduce to a
12000 square foot house
2 of the units and mention
for habitat to
rental units
7 broad perspective
on what it takes to
get things built
and I think that's another skill
that I bring to MFA might
might silly
introduction to the last
time I was interviewed as I
made a big point of I am not a
banker okay I don't
want to be a banker
the so what I bring and what
I'm learning more about
banking and finance
but I know the finance side
for running
projects
this is my passion I'm
now Everytime hundreds my
resume which I had to the 3 pager
for you if you wanted that
I'm just impressed
that I'm as old as I am and
scared by it and
I count each and every day
as an important days
to try to make a difference
in someone else's life
and that's where I come from
I have 2 priorities right now
I'm just finishing a project project
called I can't use about we're probably
being taped but it's been
I took someone else's construction
job and prima facie
has had to put up with me I forget what
I'm doing because with 6
months of a multi $0
house they walked into and they were
was all done with the plaster well
not really all the
subsystems failed so the
last 6 months I've
kept my obligation to
MFA but my main
priority has also been I
have a grandchild so
this. This all perspective
I now love
to come to Albuquerque not just
for hearings but to see
him and also to
MFA work so
I'm honored to be here and
the only other thing I meant to start
with page I forgot is
that I really
thank you for.
Passing the legislation
that makes
recurring.
Money
available.
Which Senator Rodriguez and many
of you supported
that this will make
a critical difference
in the state of New Mexico
because I know as a builder you can't
you can't. If
you don't know what the next step
is if you have so many years that you
don't have the money or you don't New Mexico you
can't do bigger projects
kind of into smaller projects and we
can't make an impact
so I'm very excited about
that opportunity the only thing
that
I'm really interested in moving
forward on with
the MFA
is $50000000 a
$35000000 sounds like a
lot of money and I'm not
on the broken record on the
board is focus focus
focus we have to
make choices and
that's their hard choices
but to the degree that we
can we need
to take one or 2 areas
and try to make a bigger impact
rather than a lesser impact
so that's what I have to say about myself
thank you thank you so much I
believe somebody is here to speak
in support of your confirmation
is that right
now.
Chairman and members of the committee
I'm going on
this the executive director
and CEO of mortgage finance
authority and not if I
can have you Sir come up to
the microphone so
that everybody watching.
Via the web can hear you
thank you for joining
us.
20 percent but
the thank you Mr chairman
and members of the committee at
my name is that you see little of non
this on the executive director
and CEO of the mortgage
finance authority
and I was so grateful to have
member Wirth burger on our board
and we are very supportive and
I look forward to
her continuing on our board so thank
you. Thank you
for your comments and what not going to go
to questions or comments
from the committee and I'm gonna start with Senator
Stefanics.
Thank you Mr chair
I consider
Rebecca a dear friend
and I thank her for
for
volunteerism throughout
the entire community of Santa
Fe and the state
when
vacancies occurred
on different boards and commissions
she was willing to be
flexible and
say she was interested in many
different of ways
of serving the state of New
Mexico and that's very
important
that somebody who really
wants to give back to the state
is open about this
in the in Santa Fe
community she has been
a major cheerleader
for housing
and we have to think Senator
Rodriguez for getting that
recurring money for the
housing she
really is the person who
bangs the gavel all
the time about affordable
housing and housing projects
so I shot up
to Senator Rodriguez
and it for
agency which burger Dr
Richard Berger I'm
wondering for the
MSA
in the near future
do you have a specific
goal or
objective.
Yeah.
I'm very interested as I
said in
continuing to work
with other board members and
legislature to
take the hard work that we've
done our we have a
strategy plan for the
state and
with the many many many needs
and it won't repeat that if you haven't
seen it but it's this
thick but this highlights
the need is far far
greater than what
we can be so the question
of how we collaborate
and try to pick the most strategic
projects that can have the most
impact on
the most people who are
the neediest people is where I
come from and that's
not to say I know we're statewide
but I would really like to have thoughtful
discussion about that
the other thing is I'm very to the
academic and research side
of me I'm a big New York times
greater okay and
I also read then The New
Mexico never day
and I have to say on
the record I have never been
so depressed and
felt so motivated
because if you just pick up the
the board's gone not just almost
talk about it every single meeting if
you if you look at what's
happening in the real
estate section it's
gone from 1000000 to
2000000 to 3000000
to 5000000 to
14000000 this
can't continue
so there are policies
and I think what I was going to
play the terms of your times
is there are there other
states that are looking
at what kind of state do as
well as what kind of look
hello do do and it has
to do with the critical issue of how
do we really make an
impact
on.
The supply side
it's wonderful to have
all the programs that we have
on down
payment assistance but
I've started to get down on the
nitty gritty on it when you have a
list of 150
people and you have
down payment assistance and no houses
they can afford to buy
or rents
help homes to move into
so I think we have to have a paradigm
shift which is focusing
and also taking
a look at other parts of the
things that are being done for example in the
state of Minnesota
I mean the city yeah Minnesota
and
Minneapolis they've
been writing nationally
about how that that city
during the
the COVID recession
was able to be the and
and then when inflation
started they did a
major push on
affordable housing with multi
family units and
by doing that they
actually had one of the lowest
inflation rates
in the in the country that
got my attention from economic
development interest but
also to have those
2 issue
areas point
so I'm just having a 10
page article in that that I read before
I got here so those
kinds of policy changes that
you can make with
respect with all the
money that we had if we had a
you know even more money and we
have the issues that are real
in places like especially
Santa Fe and now I think all
over the state where they want to
call it nimbyism or whatever you want
to call it the zoning
requirements
that we face with
larger lots
for 5 acres for
whatever.
Need to be addressed
and and another
public policy issue that is
starting to emerge we called
emerging issues at the center for
futures research is
is the issue of how can
we look at zoning
so that you can have more
than one.
1000 square foot
art of you know
10000 or 12000
square foot houses
and a lot and how that effects
as it has affect both
in terms of community
but I want talk about that for a second
but also it has
effect in terms of land
use in terms of climate change
and in terms of our water policy
so I think we
are those of us who are concerned about
housing have a critical
role in where we
go as a state to look
at it some of these issues
the other policy thing else I
and I had did some major work
on that on putting a limit on
short term rentals
and all back up and say when I
ran for office I was there 12
years the first time I ran I went
door to door right knocking
knocking knocking people
there second time
not so many third time
well there's no need to
go and I'm overstating
it it's not it's not just
short term rentals but it's
almost everything that we can
possibly do to
remove the possibility
of people living in our
communities who work there
we were doing and
those are the kinds of policy
issues sorry
is it.
That I want to deal with
that we don't normally deal with MFA
but we got to develop a
network of people
working together including
me you and whoever else
you can recommend that
that is what I would like to have my
strategic focus on the
next 2 years of my
service or whatever it is
thank you thank
you.
Thank you senator Ortiz Y.
Pino.
Thank you Mr chairman and
and Senator
thank you for sponsoring this
for doctor
receber.
And doctors were thank you for
stepping forward and being willing to
serve on the mortgage
finances Authority I either in a
couple of things from reading
your. Your
bio I didn't
realize you had a social work degree
and to as a fellow
social worker I am
always impressed when
social workers continue
in in a variety of
settings to use those
values and and those
skills.
And also didn't realize
that you got your
education largely
at Washington university
in St Louis because
my granddaughter just
started as a prices are
less 2 weeks ago
wonderful and is really excited
about it some of the
greatest.
I had a couple of
responses to what you're
saying and I wanted to
get your comments on
it. It
seems to me that we've
made.
As a society we've made
some serious
strategic
decisions in terms of
our basic
policies there were
still paying the price of in
the homelessness situation.
And this incredible gap
between what people earn and
what they can. They
have worked spend for
housing.
And one of those was
the reliance on the private
market.
To develop affordable
housing there's
no there is
no incentive to
do that when you can
make $2000000
building 110
$0 house
why would you make
$50000
building
50.
Smaller.
Less a year to almost as
expensive to build as
the year $10000000 house
bill 54 you
there's just no incentive the market
doesn't work that way
and so I think
we're really need to have
the.
Well our decision was
instead of building
public
housing.
We're going to get away from that because we also
the huge slums in Chicago
those gigantic tenements that
had gone bad and we didn't
want to do that so
we went to
doctors.
The doctors are of 0 you
can you can live in a
culture and if nobody will read to
you your voucher is
absolutely worthless so we pass
out. Thousands
of dollars hundreds of thousands of
dollars worth of vouchers in this
city to people who are
still sleeping in a tent at
night. And
so.
It just strikes me that we've got
to rethink our
reliance on the private sector
as far as affordable housing
for millionaires it works great
thank and that's
it.
But housing
even for you know for us
we can look for some of the work
force and we have to redefine the
word start with you know
because portability there are
affordability issues we got people
now who are of
you know making $200000
and they can't find a house in their
educated young they
don't leave Santa Fe like
again I'm biased of what
goes on in Santa Fe but
you're absolutely correct
and and again I think it's
I called thinking outside the box but
it's doing some really
serious.
Thought about how
can we go about doing this in the private
sector will not solve this
problem and you absolutely
have it I mean I my my life choices
around it I just worked unless campanas
I'll never do that again you can put me on the
record on that but you know
I knew I had worked in 4 years and I
did it I was going to be easy
but you're absolutely right it's the same
number of steps of
doing a habitat house
or 8 you know you get a lot
more grief but if or
or or a you know a
multi $0 home.
Oil and selling treats it
as though it's saying we we need to
prioritize of
you know if we need to we could do
we could do
plan check of what
he called over the counter report
of a house that was a you know what we're
gonna let the gonna let the
all the multi $0
homes of the wait 6
months right now you
what you mentioned the vouchers
and did is it
just couldn't ask
Espanola we're gonna
lose 50 units we can
afford to lose no
units not
sick of it long answer
was that no.
And so I
I.
Was it the the
governor's housing summit
last Friday in in
in Santa Fe.
And the
governor's office is proposing
those states Housing
Authority.
And so the the issue that came
up in our table
noted the brokers in the
small tables for discussion
usually came up as well how does
this fit in with
the New Mexico
mortgage finance authority
what what would be
the the correlation
between this new house state
Housing Authority and
the NMFA
and it struck me that
that we already have in
place with the
NMFA.
New Mexico the
NMFA.
The the the
vehicle
if if we if
we turned over
to. The
president's Authority The New Mexico
mortgage finance
authority.
A more proactive
role instead
of waiting for banks for developers
to approach them
if they could take
it initiative and go
out and
for example one thought
I had we
I don't know if Mike Michael
senators are also getting this
and I'm getting a lot of contact
from constituents who live
in trailer parks
then you were in a panic
because our has
been sold thank
you to an equity company or
to another developer
who's got big plans for the trailer
park but it go to include
them that's right they're not
they're little you
know. Single
wide that they but 30
years ago and have been living in quite
comfortably all that time
is not going to fit in with these new
plans so the rents going
to be raised they can't
afford that that will not
only become homeless the
lose the equity they
had in their
little trailer
they're gonna lose their their
trailer he can be
moved up there's no place to
move it to so my thought
is. What
about government
saying this is a form of
affordable housing
what we buy this trailer
park well and we
will run it as a
municipal trailer park
for low income families
for families were either until they
had something of that
sort. All
kinds of ideas like that
I think or what need to
be on the
table.
And.
In terms I mean I'm very
impressed I've been on a lot of
boards if you didn't see that
part I I have to say
I'm very impressed
with the
the management and
the.
The accountability of
the mortgage finance authority
but again I I guess my
vision for MFA to
tie into this is
that it would be
more than a bank that's why
I made the distinction
and and I'm feeding into what you
say and I think we don't have that
function part of the what
I'm reading is that the
cities that are able to do
this you know they do it through
their own redevelopment
agencies but
government needs to say we're going to
build housing.
And we're gonna find a way to do
it. And you can have
separate little tiny thing on
this we're talking NMFA
about
having a portion of
the staff actually do some
service delivery you know when
you and specially for rural areas
where you don't have the I can take as
a contractor you can't find people
I can get people because I
the way I've been my business and
the way I treat people I can get
people to come but the every
single dimension of
what's necessary to
increase the
supply needs to be
rethought and I think
government by just being
in the public sector can
have a primary role.
And in terms of activity
you know reaching out by the way I just
let this is it is definitely we know
this yet so this is going here for
the first time I am not
reaching out to developers who are not
involved with
MFA they're not one of our
partners right now is
you know in Santa Fe the
the what is at the mall
of the fashion mall
that is gone through 73
versions that's available
for 1.$9000000
well if I were more
I would say let's by.
Let's buy it and let's build
up and let's build
community you don't want to tear it up
because of the structural issues below
you could have a whole new thing out there
in terms of all the area of the
sprawl but
right now what's going to happen is
somebody from wherever is going to buy
it I don't think they're going to be able to do
another failing mall
that that needs to be
a primary payoffs every time
something becomes available we should support
about housing.
Okay anyway does that
fit with what you're saying but
that's because I'm
very comfortable in that role
yes it's
a proactive role for an
MFA instead of the
of the of the financing
rural right waiting for projects
to come to them.
Taking the initiative in going out
and starting things written in need to be
started without having
to wait for somebody else to get the
idea to start there get it
started. And
and the other whole areas we
use which I'm sure you all
know we've got so many
state buildings local
buildings are commercial
properties not like New York but they're
empty 3 of
date you add to that all
the into guest
houses to give it
would you know there are a lot
of places where people could
potentially be and I would say
again all
right. But it's going
to take I think
government moving in that
direction because as you
say private sector will not
do much.
Thank you thank you.
Let me just 11
place to start might be the
offices that you guys are leaving
downtown Albuquerque
I don't know what the plan is for what to
do with that space but you're moving
up to the journal
center leaving an
incredible facility in
downtown Albuquerque maybe that
ought to be the you know
take a look at converting some of
that in the housing said is selling
it to somebody else I've already
mentioned that okay
and it has
done or whatever you know but
whatever it's it's what you
parameters are pursing what's
workable because the
issues that profitable and that's
probably not the right metric in
that case right.
Great thank you thank you Mr
thank you Senator Lopez followed by
Senator
Baca.
Thank you Mr chairman
and thank you for your continued
service for your willingness to
continue serving and it's
good to see you this
morning.
Senator for what my
colleagues have already said when we talk
about housing I wish
I had an opportunity to go to
Santa Fe there was a
I called another summit is
regards to housing
earlier this week I believe
but just schedules are so
busy for everyone.
But I do believe that
NMFA has a role
in our state to
be a
convener.
Because of the work
8 the organization
has done over the years over
all the time that you've been in
existence I
believe with your
expertise that you have
but also the other members
of the board and the organization
itself should be
able to convene.
And have conversations Albuquerque
has issues Espanola has
issues I mean every
community and when
you go to rural New Mexico
that's a whole nother conversation
it's a whole nother conversation Las
Vegas there's you know there's issues
up in Vegas
Los crucis I mean if
we can talk about every community
for there are concerns
but Mr chair I
think one thing also that
needs to be on the table is what are
we doing with our on
house.
And it is about
vouchers don't work anymore
because we get phone
calls and you're trying
to work with the persons
who are landlords also even
responsible landlords
because sometimes they're not responsive
to those who have a voucher
even making it a safe place to
live
so I think we
have a lot in which
to look over in
I think NMFA has a
specific role in our
state so I
would hope that maybe you and
your fellow board members could
have a conversation we have a
retreat next week
okay well even in their treatment
helping their convene
especially all the players so it
is those who are the
builders
those who are in the
community right the
advocates
local officials talking
zoning is a big issue
very big issue in my side of the
city of we are we have a
lot of issues out there
but I know it's not just Albuquerque
is it is everywhere
so I just wanted at those and say
did duro but
again I just so appreciate
your willingness to continue
serving thank you
thank you thank you Senator
Lopez Senator
Baca.
Thank you Mr chair thank you for
appearing thank you for your service
to the state
we know that these jobs that
you all take
on in these
various positions sometimes
are are relatively
thankless and difficult
and facing
very very
challenging situations especially
in the housing market
Mr chair just a
I wanted to to just
kind of expand a little bit
about the
roll of a
a New Mexico finance at their
the 40 and NMFA
I see the director of MFA mortgage
finance authority here as well
and and you all are
in a really difficult
position you
know I hear a lot Mr
chair about
essentially.
We need to build housing the
government needs to build
housing and I think I
think you know I would I just
want to impart this to you
you know and it's my opinion
I guess
but the the
difficulty of your situation
arises because housing is
not affordable and
housing is not affordable
because wages are
not where they should be
wages are not where they should be
and the dollar is weak
inflation has driven
down what
we can buy with our dollar
so when you're making
less and when
you're the thing that you are
working for that is made is
worth less well
then you have issues like housing
which is the largest expense
usually for family
and it puts you in a
position of
of having to
solve this monumental
problem that I think we
can put a bandaid on locally
but nationally
there issues driving
that that
shortage as
well you know recently we had
a visit by the president here and
all I'll be real Frank
with you you know he
touted by Namik some
what I've seen is for dollar
gas inflation at
multi year highs
and wages at low schools
small businesses are shutting
down I'm
gonna tell you to that is not
a healthy environment for
housing on that
that is when we find
people on
the streets and not
able to afford a place
to live and I
think we have to do what we
can to to address
some of the more
macro
issues
before we can have
the real ability
in this state especially with our
my new budget Mr
chair that we have
nationally we're
working with the $9000000000
budget or so in
this state which is really
a I mean that's
the economically
speaking that's less than
many cities in the
country
and so it's difficult to
use that type
of money to solve such
horrendous issues
and anyway I was just wanting
to bring somebody to. Engine to
that because I think
the issue is
not just how much money
can we spend here but broader
issues and questions
that we have to attack
in policy on on a broader
level to solve the the
problem that we have with housing
in the state in other
states again
I hear you I appreciate your
experience that you bring
here I believe
I supported the last time I plan
on supporting you here today
and thank you for submitting
yourself to the scrutiny of this
committee and the state
as well thank you thank you
Mr thank you so
focus under
Stuart.
Thank you Mr
chairman.
Hi I'm I just want
to under score
of what Senator Lopez
said a few minutes ago
about a convening.
So the governor told me
she was going to
convene
and have a meeting for
people to look at the
science of reading and we did
that yesterday
and it was unbelievable
it certainly exceeded my
expectations because
who is in her convening
was everyone who
was part of that discussion
so I just want
to tell you that I
just think this is a great
idea that Senator
Lopez has
suggested
because you can think
about
prizes you
think about public
you can bring
all the people that you've talked
about today that are part of
this issue a
together and I think MSA
is would be a good
convener so
the governor thank basically
did our self yesterday
up to her staff
invited higher
ed tribal
leaders
teacher representatives
superintendents
some legislators that are
on education finance
committees and by the end
of the day everyone was
saying thank you
for having me
take part
and when we sat at the
tables at every table
was a tribal
leader a legislator
higher ed
superintendent or a
teacher etcetera
so we had an
incredible day and at the
end of the day up
there was so much
enthusiasm
because everybody who needed
to be there was there
so I'm
now a firm believer in
someone convening
everybody around this
issues so so this is
a really good idea and I
I'm glad to director is here
it was my comments are
partly addressed
to him
so thank you Mr
chairman thank you I
think you just want to comment
from me I want to thank you for your service
of bringing your life experience
so somebody who was raised in poverty
knows that life experience
helps when we can
try to make and shape and
influence the state of New
Mexico but those life
experiences help us to be
the voice for people who sometimes
feel their voice isn't
heard so one of thank you
for being vulnerable
and letting us know about your
past and so with
that what is the will of the committee Senator
Stewart Mr chairman I
move that we
approve the reappointment
of perfect over its broker to
New Mexico for mortgage

Mexico university from

Greentree solid waste
authority

and he has a whole
list of awards
and recognitions that he's gotten
over the years but all
handed over to doctor
Miller to tell us more about
himself.
Thank you for inviting me here
today.
I've lived in New Mexico since
1954.
First in Los Alamos for
3 years then
Anthony and then I kind of
jumped around during the
college years to
Albuquerque Carrizozo
Farmington and then
I live in the rural part of
Lincoln County North Rideau
so.
My service earlier
on the renewable energy
transmission authority was
basically.
To provide a rural
perspective to that
board because it currently
I'm the only really rural
person
that served on at least
an interim basis on
that on that
board
very familiar with what
has gone on before
and what is now starting to
go on in
the Corona
area.
Sort of the board member that
actually lives in wind
energy
country.
You can tell I drove through Corona
this morning
new hardware store
new
laundromat.
To restaurants
and the RV parks are
filling up real quick
now.
So and
the.
New Mexico renewable energy
authority has been involved in
that for quite a few
years now.
Of.
I don't know what else I should
say
certainly available for
questions.
I will that will get us started
thank you so much doctor
Miller.
Yes is there anybody here to
speak in favor of doctor
Miller or
opposition.
Don't worry we haven't had anybody
else here in the for our
opposition so
nobody's picking on
you.
So Senator Stefanics
Senator chairs back
thank you very much madam
chair Mister chair
the doctor
Miller thank you for all of your community
service
down in the community
and the question I
have is
for many many years Rita
did not do much.
It was actually sentiment
about well after 10 years
they didn't do much maybe they should just
go away and now we're seeing
a lot of activity which is
great in my
opinion.
What or how
does your
board
handle.
Opposition
divisiveness in the
community in terms
of we want
the project we don't want the
project
so I
understand that many
times these projects
you State Land.
They use private
land and
there is a pay back to
the schools in terms of
up payment in lieu of
taxes
but could you
talk about how the board
handles any kind
of public
outcry.
Certainly of
Mr Chairman Senator
Stefanics.
One of the strengths
of the authority and its
staff is
the and it's
contracts
staff.
To work with companies
like pattern energy
in central New Mexico right
now
and they have people and
one of the reasons why they have
taken over now number
projects
is that they've got people
that have very good people
skills.
And they know how to work with
landowners.
And they know how to
negotiate with land
owners
and.
The executive director just
walked in
and he works
a lot with
landowners and with
state agencies
to.
Of. Make those
kind of conflicts go
away.
In the
the conflicts
are part of what
has
extended the time frame
for these projects out
long. Fairly
long.
But I think the the
staff for the
authority board.
Of is
involved in that more than
we of the board
members are on a day to day
basis.
Thank you and
Mr chair doctor
do you have any
what would you say
your.
Goals or objectives
are for the your
position.
Of the
Mister chairman Senator
Stefanics the
the authority is currently
working on I believe it's
now 6 different
projects.
And your point is well taken
that for number of years there weren't
any.
Of the first
project they did was the
high lonesome wind farm
south of Wheeler.
Of.
They work with the
Western Spirit project
in. In
Torrance
County.
And now there are 6 different
projects.
Most of them in
northeastern and eastern New
Mexico
one proposal is I
guess comes from southwestern
New Mexico.
Of.
The I'd
say I'd
like to particularly I'd
like to see the sun's a
now Rio projects go to
fruition because
I've worked as a community
leader in that
region since
2011
or 12 on
them trying to generate economic
development for small business
owners.
Most recently
trying to train young
people to become
the turbine
technicians
that operate in service
the wind turbines.
Are working
most closely with Mason
lands community
college.
Another thing I've done as
an as an interim board
member is I
take groups of
people to
tour the wind farm
at the New Mexico
state research
facility the red cloud
wind farm.
Because for example the
up 3 to
staff works
very hard every day
on these kind of projects
but most of them had
never been to a wind
farmer seen a transmission
project.
And so over the last couple
years I've taken
groups of state agency
people county
commissioners read a
staff we meeting
Corona at 930
at the post office
we go out to New Mexico
state so they
get an orientation on the
research that New Mexico
state is doing at their research
facility and
then we get a tour
of a wind turbine
there are people
that want to climb the winter
anymore you can't do
that but you
can go to the operations center
you put on a hard hat
safety vest
and you get to see the base of
1 on 1 look up and see
what this deal is
really all about.
You get to see the other
resources that are
generating money for rural
areas like.
The sale of caliche
to to make
roads to these
turbines and and service
roads.
You you get involved
in
of.
Advising landowners
on how to negotiate
contracts with multinational
energy companies.
And I'd like to see those
2 projects in
particular and
then a couple of the other projects
that I'm involved in is a
on the project development
team come to
fruition also.
Thank you very much.
Thank you Senator
Duhigg.
Thank you Mr chair
and and Dr I
I don't know if this is really something
that would fall within
your scope but
there were some articles in
in the Albuquerque journal
recently
about data series
on
companies that are
providing
solar
to resident residents
and using some
are not great
practices I I would I would
say some predatory
practices are
is that and and I
know that there are a lot of good solar
companies out there as well
but there are some of these bad
actors who are out
there
is
would.
With the New Mexico renewable
energy transmission authority have
any role in.
Coming up with some suggestions
of changes that might be
made to address those
practices
on for that
industry.
Mr Chairman
Senator I'm
not really sure
the the authority really is
not worked with solar
much at all and
if they did it would be utility
scale not residential
because I think most of the
problems and we had
a New Mexico
solar office
closed in Reno so
as part of one of these
deals
I don't know that that
read would have advice
on.
Residential solar
companies I work with
one or 2 solar companies
because I still
encourage people to
put of
solar on the roof because I've
had solar on my roof for 10
years now.
And.
We have reliable
companies in New
Mexico.
Of they haven't folded
or they're
not showing up in the
Albuquerque journal
of as the
recent articles
have a but
I don't know that we do would get involved
in that kind of thing.
Thank you thank you
Mr.
Thank you any other questions
Senator Ortiz Y. Pino
thank you Mr chairman thank
you doctor Miller for
for serving on the re aboard
this is incredibly important
project that
you're.
That you're stepping forward in being
willing to to help
direct.
It never did that
understanding of the other side
thinks
I regularly
read the morning blog
by Joe Monahan
2 you too SO
he recently had a whole series
of of I guess
some of his readers
of.
Bringing up issues around
Rita and
for uses this to have
this all they do is
send energy to California or
Nevada or
Arizona but we benefiting
wonder what is New Mexico going to
get any benefit from all of
this the expenditures
going on here
I think what you've said
this morning already
response to that
but is there
any thing of
foot. In
the planning stages even
to begin using some of
this wind power
energy in our
local investor
owned utilities.
Mister chairman
Senator
in the the the
large.
Most apparent
project.
The sun 0 project
the first 2 thirds of that
project is DC
line.
That are cannot be
tapped once
it leaves the generation
area so that will go to
southwestern Arizona
to go into the grid of
California.
And there's no way
to
to.
You know 8 some of that
offer Albuquerque or sick
or or
whatever. The
L. realligned though will be
an AC line and it
will run parallel to
the to the sons
aligned.
Because it's a
C.
then if there are wind
farms in other areas
or probably in this
case from utility
scale solar farms
they can plug into
it and
communities could off
take power
that is in that AC
line which the DC line
does not allow
for.
I guess my argument always
is that if you watch
the oil and gas
industry.
The oil and gas industry
generates most of its
energy for out of
state customers.
And that's sort of a long tradition
in New Mexico and
really
of wind
energy in and
high voltage transmission
is really not much different
than the act.
And so I don't I don't know if there's going
to be any real change and
that. She could
early if you have
high voltage DC
lines that take
power
elsewhere.
Mr chairman and doctor
Miller I guess the
the argument that's been put
forward as well oil
and gas for getting the royalties
in the and the tax
off of it so we are getting some
direct benefit immediately
in the
state.
I don't know if there's any way we could ever
do that with electricity
but we are getting the payments to
the landowners
are getting the construction
costs we're getting
the possibility of
of in the future at least
of of low
cost electricity
being able to be tapped off of the
AC lines so there's
there's lots of other
benefits that we're getting
I just think we need to be real
real clear about the fact
that.
We're not just you're doing
something for New Mexico alone
we're trying to do something for
the for
the benefit of the
entire society
effective the whole globe
we can find ways of of
the producing
energy without using fossil
fuels we're gonna be making
a big contribution to the
to the health of the entire globe
so I I I really
think what you're doing is
important I'm
glad you willing to step forward
and I want to just
express my gratitude to you thank
you thank you for
what my last
comment Mr
chairman of
the the other thing it does for
rural counties as it
generates permanent
jobs that don't require
a 4 year college
degree.
And I've been in the college of business
for a long time
and unfortunately high
school counselors like to
encourage kids to
go to 4 year
colleges.
We need to keep generating
jobs that require
one or 2 years
at the Max
and those jobs in
the wind industry
will started 55 to
$60000 a
year and there's a
lot of young people
that they like to work
with their hands.
And
they need those opportunities
and they need them close to home
not to move to
Albuquerque
or to Texas sort of
Phoenix they need to be
close to home
and I think that's part of the
benefit of these kind of
projects and the
work that read it
does.
Thank you Senator
Baca.
Thank you thank you Mr chairman
thank you for coming forward
to accept
this responsibility and
put yourself out there in this way I
wanted to ask you a
question Mr
chair
are you aware
of can you tell me how
much litigation goes on
between of
placement of these transit
transmission lines and
landowners in the
state.
Senator rock I guess I defer
to the executive director
because I really don't
don't know.
Mr Chairman
you can come up to the Mike.
And then if you can state your first
and last name for the record and for
those listening in.
Senator.
I guess it's still morning right now
almost a noon but
a good morning Mr chairman
and committee members on Fernando
Martinez I am the
executive director of the renewable
energy transmission
authority.
And so Mr
chairman and and senator
Bach in answer to your
question
I'll give you a couple of
examples are
Western Spirit line
which doctor Miller was actually
instrumental in in in getting
that into commercial operation
as a board member
and to his other work as
well run
155
miles and it
went through several county Santa
Fe Torrance
Sikora Valencia Bernalillo
county's about
433
parcels of land were we
got right of way another
300 of
parcels of land of access
agreements and we did not have
a single case of eminent
domain and and
that and not case
we had 18 cases of
uncontested eminent domain
so this goes back to
the comments Dr Miller was
making a little bit earlier about the
importance of working
with the landowners and
all the various stakeholders through
early engagements
a second example is is
the son CEO and the real soul
projects which are total
of 550 miles
lines on
350 footer in New
Mexico and
out of those 350 miles
in New Mexico again
we manage to get all the land
without a single case of eminent
domain it's
some very important to
us that we avoid those type
of things that we're working
with all the stakeholders
from the very beginning
and trying to
stay away from routes
for we could provide
potential issues were
people really don't want to
enter there's cultural
resources or environmental
reasons for not doing it
so our
priorities always to look
first for existing
corridors and
when we don't have existing
corridors that's when we really
go out on a full on blitz
and we spend a lot of time out
in the communities and
and trying to
cite these
things.
We're we're we're not gonna have
a whole lot of contraception
are always possible when you're talking
that many parcels of land and
that many agreements you have to come
up with I'm not seen will
never have eminent
domain
cases they're contested
but so far we've
we've been able to avoid it so
and hopefully that can continue
into the future.
Thank you Mr chairman
under the hi
hi to read
that certain blog
for views on the other
side so I didn't
realize that me and
senator Ortiz Pino shared so
much in
common.
The other side I did.
Which means we must be on the safe
side.
Therefore anyway says
some of the some of the concerns
cited in in some of
that is a
to be valid I I do
see that you know much
of this energy is
going out
of the state and that concerns me
because it's using
natural resources and
and my my opinion
time stealing.
Of of our
scenic we're seeing
the state here and so
you know it concerns me I
guess I would add
to that that really you know
just to you know based
on the discussion earlier about why
is in New Mexico keeping some
of this and Mr
chair that you know it's just my
opinion you can tell me if I'm wrong
but having been probably
the only person in here to
dispatch power in the
state and I've dispatched
wind and and
nuclear and coal at when that
existed natural gas and
diesel fuel
that I can tell you the most
the most challenging
dispatchable energy that we
have was
wind by
far
we ended has
reliability issues in
that it can be the
peak of summer and it can be
producing many hundreds of
megawatts and then
it's the wind stops
and now you're turning
towards
gas generation diesel
generation to fill in those
spots many times
so. Think that
that is probably although
not cited one of the
reasons that we
don't tap into
some of this to a higher degree
is just the national reliability
standards which would not allow
for that but
all I really just wanted to
just point to the
landowners I
I heard I I did
hear what what was said about
eminent domain in
and of the key words a
lot of times is that
uncontested eminent
domain and the and
I live in Valencia County
and I have a lot of constituents
who live in the
community of hot on a
simple sketch all
right we're that that
transmission line went through and I can
tell you a lot of them were very
unhappy but
lacked the financial
resources to put together
an organized fight
on to to the
prevent that so I'll
just point that out
I do think that there is
some utility in
in having
that
that transmission located
here however it does
have its drawbacks I think would
be lying to ourselves
if we if we didn't
acknowledge some of those drawbacks
and some of the sacrifices of the
people in the state have
made to provide power
to California
and Arizona and so
at the end of the day the
that's that's who I'm
concerned with is is is
the people in the state
and so I just ask that
you just
keep an eye out for them and
going forward and
I look forward to working
with you should you pass this
nomination I do intend on
supporting you
it's I looked at your resume I
think are you it's a
very commendable an
honorable
and I
think that you'll do a fine
job in in the place they
you were put so
thanks again for being here today and
submitting yourselves to questions and
thank you Sir for your answers
thank you know before I go back
to any questions of the will of
the committee we were
a few minutes early were you here
to make a few comments on
behalf of the
country.
Mr chairman and
committee members yes I
was if you want
to take 2 minutes to go ahead
and speak on behalf of the country
we can do that now before we do the will
of the committee okay
thank you Mr
chairman I just want to point out that
I've been working with doctor
Miller now for the last 4
years and and various
capacities on on
various projects
and is
experience and
his knowledge is
just a it's it's
crucial at the point in time
or were at to have
him on our reader board
and it would
fully stand in support of
of his confirmation
here for a lot
of reasons one
we have a great
many projects right
now that that are just
massive.
With the Western Spirit project
that I worked with doctor Miller
on for for many
years that
one of the largest single phase
wind farm in US
history.
Last Friday we
broke ground not
only the biggest project
in New Mexico renewable
energy project in Mexico
history or U. S.
history but it's also the
biggest one in the western
hemisphere.
So this is going to create
about over $20000000000
in and capital
investment
we if you add up
our real soul
project our
sons your project in our
north path project just
those 3 alone
are over $16000000000
in capital investment and
growth powering millions of
homes what
I would say is like
her a lot of concerns here
this morning about
some of this power being utilized
within New
Mexico you know
doctor Miller was exactly
right in pointing out Rio soul
which is a C. which can be
utilized in this state all point
out a couple of others
1 is the north path project
this is 4000
megawatts although
it is a DC line it has a
converter station in northeast
New Mexico and a converter
station in the 4 corners
region northwest New Mexico
which means a lot of that power can
be utilized in state as
well we also have
our moral line which is going
to be 100 percent
utilized in in New Mexico
and we're expecting that to be in commercial
operation by the end of
2025
so in short it's a crucial
time for return for the
state we
have.
Tens of billions of
dollars
either in construction or moving
towards construction with
thousands of jobs and
and you
know this is just an opportunity
we need experienced
knowledgeable board members in
order to these are very complicated
projects I would
say that the.
Energy grid is probably
the.
Most complex human
made machine that this and
exist in existence
we have the most reliable
energy in the world it's
important that we keep doing that
ultimately because of the
intermittent nature as as
Senator Baca rightly
pointed out there are
issues with that and we
feel we can get that
way by having
an upgraded flexible
regional grid ultimately
for we have lots of
interconnections we have
meteorological diversity
geographical
diversity
we're also working on utility
scale storage as well to
from capacity
so our bottom line here
is we want to keep energy
costs low
we want to keep energy
reliable we want to keep
our stay competitive with other
states and
and having a knowledgeable
board member like Dr Miller
this is dedicated his
life to see these projects
through is is just absolutely
essential.
Thank you for those comments signal other
questions or comments what's the will of the
committee motion
by Senator Stefanics
second by Senator Ortiz
the Pino is there
anyone in opposition of this
country.
The numbers for excuse
7 in favor
congratulations on your
confirmation.
We did move ahead of schedule
this morning we moved a little
quickly we are going to
be taking a short recess
for lunch should be coming
back at 1:30
PM to pick up
on the rest of the agenda
and so on
I know that the governor's office
had scheduled time
on when the confirmation be
here if we see that they're
here earlier we can then
start the meeting
earlier chairwoman
to hit yes
thank you
Mr chair yeah I I
think that our next
folks were planning on being here at
115.
On.
Looking looking at listen
to see if that's correct.
So it may be a state say
115 second
so we then can then
start back at 115
we're gonna take a short entry
says we'll see you
that.
Thanks for.
