For us today we passed on ninety
one and house bill six we might
change the order of those for
the committee one thing I didn't
mention transitional meeting is
our general practice of not
taking those people are out of
the room so if people are
temporarily out of the room
they're presenting and other
bills.
Whatever
we will hold the until we get
back
If we think that's going to
affect the outcome of the.
It's I can't really do that you
for missing people like if
you're out sick you're not
you're entirely we're not going
to waste but you know the sort
of temporary absence.
Happen.
Representative the other bills
if we think that will affect
our.
Not.
and I had one other thing to
answer the questions
was before you right now.
I think you want to be of the
questions or comments or other
announcements.
So this is.
We're doing soon for the people
listening at home in the
committee we're doing so for the
first time
virtual testimony involved one a
live.
to be.
You're watching the webcast you
can see that there's.
Relatively the elevation back in
the room.
But it's also really far away so
like there's a list of names
usually I can see these in these
I can't see that from here.
In what we will do if you do
want to testify on a bill we
will have you raise your hand.
and then we will.
I would call on you certainly I
can full of disease on my laptop
so it's just okay so the only
two that.
So at the beginning of every
session I think we have to
figure things out all over again
and it it takes a while this is
also.
This is our first fully in
person sessions you know two
years so there's even more to
figure out especially with this
stuff all the.
Eight on the agenda.
Email.
Representative Ferrary are you
ready.
Mr chair I can't reach my.
Okay.
So Representative Townsend are
you ready I can be reached.
Yeah.
Yes sorry.
Capacity.
we'll go to the state to do
things that are.
Representative break up.
Representative Dixon.
Representative Garcia.
Representative Montoya.
Representative Nibert.
Representative Rubio here.
Representative Scott your.
Representative small.
Representative Townsend Here.
Vice chair Sarinana.
Chairman queen.
We have a quorum.
Okay
Representative Townsend.
Thank you Mr chairman committee
house bill ninety six.
Is introduced to try to fix a
problem that's readily apparent
New Mexico and that is the.
Black out and brown else that
Townsend Here.
It's one.
Red lake try to fix a problem
that has been identified by our
providers in New Mexico so
especially in the Albuquerque
area of roundhouse and
blackouts.
Let me first say.
That.
I understand.
As I'm sure many of you do that
natural gas is not a renewable.
That's readily apparent.
But I don't know of another tool
that New Mexico producers have
our producers have tried to
eliminate.
The.
A problem that they're faced
with probably over the next five
to ten years at the very minimum
as they develop.
A system where.
Those renewables that we're
currently dedicated to can.
Chand
Be integrated and and become
dependable.
Mexico consumers.
So this bill allows.
for natural gas to be included
in the portfolio.
So that those providers can.
Service our constituents in New
Mexico.
I I believe it is mean absolute
nuclear.
I don't know of another source
that we have that I could say.
Low carbon or no carbon in the
case of nuclear.
And is dispatchable.
and certainly.
The clear permitting time is
significantly more than natural
gas for generations.
That can be moved.
Readily available it could be.
At either to Escalante or to the
four corners it could be a stand
alone power.
Station.
Anywhere in the state where yet
natural gas so my purpose is to
try to fix the problem that
spaces New Mexico
It's readily apparent to the I
mean adding natural gas to the
portfolio would be good for.
Our energy providers in New
Mexico.
And it would be one
That I think they will all.
See is the most expedient fix to
the problem that they face so
with that I stand for questions.
Thank you Representative
Townsend in this party usually
screw up with first for you the
committee on.
so over there people not into
would like to.
Audience in the room first is
there anyone in the audience
would like to yes I Peter.
So we'll just.
You the three
I think chairman.
Chester.
thanks once report the spill you
just want to add a couple points
through this
California governor.
Yes was the player we.
The reason being is that
important these burning fuels
also provides that the liability
is needed true that roundhouse
lines what was the rating here
with this bill in life so.
Is that it uses the
opportunities aside the fact
that recently seeing missions
behind says.
It because yes and this is one
of those bills.
That would allow for that I will
be with you very clean burning
fuel so for that reason and many
others we stand.
Yes.
We went over New Mexico which we
stand in support of this bill
the reason for.
As well as that reasons that
what you're on.
This
chairman members of the
committee of response.
Schools are cooperative
association health plans one is
that the solution would also
like to work on.
Quickstart of Bill
Representative what we need
which we have in the county.
Or was that just for the.
Anyone else in the room is.
Opposition.
this is.
Count I need time and jacket
with CNN and the oppose this
bill because we are looking to
achieve it definitely will
transition away from oil and gas
as well as the chief government
appropriation five and second
quarter of twenty nineteen the
inclusion of renewable this time
of natural gas in the letters
after undergoing those schools
and for that.
J. Hann we ask that you.
Yes the morning Mr chairman of
the committee was gonna with
this or chapter
thirty five thousand members and
supporters throughout the state
status from opposition to the
inclusion of combined cycle
methane gases or little energy I
thank guests of the non
renewable fossil fuel that one
is expected by the where we can
combusted damages are here water
quality.
It doesn't matter where for home
births also fuels or how many
cycles and our in house I've
been realizing during on the if
you will and it's not a.
and so
it undermines the purpose of the
renewable energy activities
relative to population in the
addressing of the evolution
facilities
status project opposition to the
actual.
The.
anyone else in the room the
office it so that.
We are in New if you like to
speak in favor of the bill.
If you if you like to speak
about this issue.
the first that we have.
Are less contact
You I. we.
You are under.
These are all.
Not to sound.
Our.
So.
In the area.
These listing is.
Thank you Mr chairman and
members of the committee and
parliament unpacked president
and CEO of the New Mexico
business coalition we are in the
office for possibilities X. we
believe that necessary to
resolve the issues of
reliability.
Where the rolling around the
block out
that.
What is the operating cost more
so it's hard for hospitals and
those people that are on life
saving measures at home.
Four even one minute power to
the house we have not been able
to resolve that issue actively
what we have.
Currently unless we use natural
gas.
Three hours at a time when not
blowing and the sun is not
shining and for those reasons
yeah that support this bill
thank you.
But there's one.
Okay so what
thank you the they're gonna get
to the committee.
questions or comments from.
one so it.
Thank you Mr chairman.
Representative Townsend
We know the California.
Took a similar measure.
and I and I believe that was for
similar reasons
prior to New Mexico.
kind of full steam ahead.
I am the energy transition act
California was the head of us
and that.
and I know
I don't think anybody would
consider.
Governor Newsom.
Any sort of a
person profiting from oil and
gas or for those reasons so
could you briefly to discuss
California taking similar steps
as to what you're requesting
here your bill yes
Representative Mr chair
California Berkeley one other
states have.
Done this added natural gas to
their ability to meet demand of
their people.
And.
And although that has has
occurred my name.
Dr it's been you remember
debates last year on the house
floor.
Right here.
Is not following California
anybody else might do is to try
to fix what is ailing New
Mexico.
you have.
As has been mentioned and
comments you have many
industries have health
facilities you have schools
we're trying to develop more and
more
to electric vehicles and the
idea.
Of having our largest community
in New Mexico staff for Reynolds
and black ops is just one that I
thought Legislature of trying to
fix
if it's not required then.
That would be I mean I I I'm I'm
not trying to do anything other
than fix a problem that I
understand
our largest provider has said is
imminent.
And I think it's incumbent on
the legislature to try to
protect the that's all I'm
trying to.
Mr Chairman Representative
Townsend so last year I know
because effects in my community
San Juan
Mexico plant went down the.
It permanently.
but.
Because of what we were told
we're gonna be blackouts and
brownouts in Albuquerque.
Secular extend the life.
Asked for an extension of the
life of that plant for three
months to get us past past peak
production.
Need in Albuquerque I understand
we just kind of kick that.
falls into this year and so what
we're gonna be facing the same
issue and Albuquerque's so
residents of Albuquerque.
And as I mentioned by Carlos on
tagging yourself talking about.
What we'll do the business and
for people who are in hospital
hospitals or potentially have
have a.
Medical equipment home but what
has not been discussed is the
poor.
the poor folks in Albuquerque
the poor folks
they're not gonna be as able as
some folks have already gone out
and bought a generator that I
could use if I need to be able
to keep my food the.
Rules and not just a run air
conditioner I think we'll all
maybe have to go without air
conditioner on the brown outs
and black outs come but
For I just briefly would like to
to talk about
What happens to the for families
when the refrigerators go out
when the freezers go out.
Are they going to be as easily
able as maybe somebody has a bit
more money in the bank to go out
and replace the the food in
their refrigerators and freezers
when this happens or are I think
likely they'll try just eat the
food.
When it.
And that the freezer comes back
on and I just I just worry about
that risk and so for the for the
poor let's say in this in the
provider area is that is that
one of the reasons for bringing
this forward
Representative and Mr Chairman I
think I have been.
Dozens of comments from people
outside of my district quite
frankly
over that issue
the health concerns the
business's
Has been an issue that people
are very concerned about
Most definitely as we all know
whether this bill or many other
bills that we have for us we
have to be careful to.
Legislation that we passed so.
Does not.
specifically target those that
are that have the.
The lower incomes of of our
civilization
I think I think that's exactly
right.
Again my issue was.
Then I was trying to play the
the target the you know this is
to help you know.
This person or that person my
issue was that.
Our providers and do not have
the dispatchable.
Power supply.
The media Lee bailable to for
them to meet the demand of the
people whether it's businesses
or homes and my my thought was.
That there's no other source
that we have readily available
in New Mexico.
That is.
It is always available.
Yeah it is dispatchable on
demand you can ramp it up and
down very quickly you can't do
that with co.
If we could.
If we.
The legislature could come
together.
I understand that we are
bridging the gap.
For the development of all of
these renewable set we're
dedicated to that we we have a
pool in New Mexico that we can
do that other states for the
seems to make sense that we do
that I mean the infrastructure
in the and all the power lines
for example the four corners
power plant is there right now
means that was have the ego over
two hundred fifty Meg source of
they're the new kids that.
you know of.
Relatively small combined cycle
turbines up there and you could
continue to use the
infrastructure he could meet the
demands it was dispatchable it
would ramp up and down the main
it just seems to be a logical
fix and that that's all this
bill is trying to do is try to
bridge the gap so just a couple
more questions Mr chairman
Townsend so the question is.
If we had more.
We bring more renewables online
we bring on more.
solar plants we bring on more
wind farms.
When the sun's not shining winds
not blowing do we currently have
battery storage.
That would allow for us to store
the extra energy.
That would be approach that
would be created.
Through wind and solar do we
have to date for this summer for
the near future.
Do we have in place battery
storage technology.
That would allow us to capture.
At an industrial.
size capacity do we have that in
place right now to keep.
This from harming businesses
people on time medical equipment
people of the poor folks who
need their conditioners running
when they want to.
and especially as we're trying
to ramp up thank you so it's a
of those more electric vehicles
and taxed and read more even if
we increase more.
Renewables as they currently
exist today wind and solar.
Do we have the ability to store
that so we can keep our
electricity on the sun's not
shining and winds not blowing.
Representative Mr chairman we do
not and the.
That's that's the gap on trying
to feel warming we have the
technology quite frankly but I
don't know that we can afford
it.
And that's the other thing is
that the battery storage
although we have the.
I think what we're beginning to
get the capacity were probably
ten or fifteen years out and
having good battery of
technology available to to use.
But that battery storage is very
expensive and this bridges that
gap that we're.
People are not only have the
ability to have dispatchable
power it's also emit economical
source
I'm not trying.
And if somebody wanted to put a
sunset on this bill that said it
was ten years I'm okay with
that.
I just think there's a issue out
there and we.
are going to have to address
that and it will be easy on
would be easier on legislators
quite frankly to fix that before
we have a brown out or black
out.
Instead of afterwards.
Thank you Mr chairman I.
My questions were directed
towards that.
This
Years to be.
Not an unreasonable.
Measure to take.
Measures there they've taken
frankly and
blue states.
in Europe.
this is frankly an answer.
Until the battery storage
technology is here this is just
a bridge.
And I I don't understand why we
would punish.
people who are not able to come
in here cells are leaving
Albuquerque that live provider
area of
all of our.
Utilities
it just doesn't make sense what
we have a chance to keep from
harming them.
we we talk about how it's for
the people in the meantime I
don't see many people who are
begging to have their tab on
reliable and and really
expensive electricity
I don't see anybody demanding
that what I what I've heard from
folks Mr Chairman is that yes we
want to be responsible with the
environment.
But I want my air conditioner I
want my food to be protected I
want to have a plan I'm on I'm
on oxygen machine I want to be
running around the clock not
just when utility determines
that my area of town is going to
have electricity so I I
appreciate you bringing this
bill forward I think it's a
reasonable measure and I think
your
offering to potentially put a
sunset for a ring you know that
would have to come up for
renewal
offering not just used to make
your your bill even that much
more reasonable thank you Mr
chairman.
There is a separate
Representative Scott.
Mr Chairman true.
This
call is.
The last.
A
each.
One
of the.
She.
Our new.
That will provide more than.
Thank you all.
Calls.
Representative and Mr chairman
not to them we're a.
What.
To to talk about.
The.
We need to.
Call.
The question.
The lower wage.
Where what version all she.
To.
The state.
Mention this.
Think of Mr Chairman
representative.
based on my memory
Those rural electric co ops that
then braced renewable portfolio
as our main source their power
today is about fifty to sixty
percent higher than those that
happened.
So the differences between.
Eleven eleven to thirteen stamps
on the low end
to
Seventeen and nineteen cents on
the high.
You're looking to.
What the term level.
The walls.
This.
Those of our constituents so.
Representative Mr Chairman that
are of.
The most of.
Butchofsky.
Financially with the end be the
most harm.
Those with with a little with
the the lower income people are
definitely the ones for her
first.
And her worst.
You have to.
To.
The committee is also.
What is the that would be chair
already technology.
This legislation.
So
madam chair excuse me I said yes
you're welcome madam chair and
representative of.
It's my understanding and based
on my
Research at the cost of our.
Generated by combined cycle
natural gas is probably.
You'll correct me I know but
it's probably one twentieth of
battery storage probably more
than that probably I'm not well
I that.
But more importantly it is
dispatchable and it ramps up and
down very easily
I don't know of another
technology to truly available in
New Mexico that we can put
online in the time frame that
these.
Pliers need.
That is anywhere close to being.
How are generated.
More economically than that.
Produced by combined cycle
natural gas.
And.
Representative two.
This call.
You'll see federal
Representative.
Representative all right
to use to call.
Changes hands.
Sure.
They can get very compatible.
The new technologies that.
That is
Chair and and Representative
that's absolutely
correct and
I think it relate to need X.
gets.
It's.
Any time that we as a
legislature.
Start down the path of
supporting a new technology
which I think we should to.
the week you have to be
concerned.
First and foremost to taking
care of our constituents over
the the political policies quite
frankly of our who may be
leaving the state at the time.
I mean even though we may have
an agenda.
Whether it's Republican or
Democrat we still whether
regardless of which side of the
hour on we still have the
concerned with taking care of
the people of New Mexico and
There it is not another source
of power and I would readily.
Except amendment to the bill.
If there was another source of
power that I thought that was
immediately available
economically feasible that we
get the.
Into the renewable portfolio for
people to generate.
to protect the people of New
Mexico.
That's all this bill tries to
tries to protect the people of
New Mexico and there's not
another way to deal with that I
know but I'm I'm I'm open to
that.
Mr will do just.
More.
Yes New Mexico
is home grown.
She was.
Representative and Mr chair
we're awash with natural gas in
New Mexico.
We're one of the leading
suppliers of natural gas and
There would not be a problem
serving in the power plant in
New Mexico with the readily
supply of natural gas that that
the state would also derived.
income from from the production
of that same natural gas in New
Mexico.
Which leads me to my last
question is your.
Just.
Guests.
The state.
Generating tax.
Absolutely.
It Mr chairman and
Representative but I are leaving
Income sources and in New Mexico
and
We have been blessed with a
plentiful supply of the
but again I say this and I'll
say it again.
My initiative was to try to fix
what I thought was the problem
in New Mexico and that was I
think it would be horribly
embarrassing the largest city in
our state ran out of power
we're.
And we.
And we didn't do anything about
it and that's that's my point.
Thank you.
All thank you Mr chairman thank
you very much for small towns
and have a couple questions
Representative Townsend Mr
Chairman first on the history
the hydraulic fracturing which
brought on a lot of new gas
supplies sort of the early and
especially mid two thousands
that saw the rise of natural gas
power in the decline of coal
power is that accurate.
Chair representative we have
had.
in the last.
Forty years that I know of.
We have in the wash with natural
gas in New Mexico long before.
Of.
What.
You refer to is our ongoing and
hydraulic fracturing.
Has that technology in the hands
of production absolutely it has.
But I don't know that it has had
any effect on the production of
coal.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
Representative Townsend
my understanding actually use we
saw the nations are more coal
plants that were retired during
the administration's lateness
iterations of president Obama
then president trump and that
was mainly with the rise and
natural gas and the decline in
coal and I Mr chair I think
Do that and that is a very much
money my clear understanding and
so Mr chair representative
Townsend appreciate sort of the
discussion on the history I
think there's a very direct and
and causal link between natural
gas being used for electricity
the rise in that in the decline
in coal and we see that a number
of places Mr chair
representative Townsend I want
to go to a couple other quick
things.
Talked about the cost and we saw
Mr chair representative Townsend
sort of.
The.
Just then at world events please
for my generation
the invasion of Ukraine by
Russia spike in commodity prices
earlier this summer.
What it did that raise natural
gas prices during the summer.
Mr chair and representative it
certainly.
is certainly affected world
prices.
And I I understand where you're
where you're coming from but let
me say this.
Representative.
The people in the south out of
Albuquerque.
They are not as concerned with
Ukraine is they are the
temperature in the house.
And and although natural gas
prices may rise and fall with
world economies it always works.
And it comes on every time they
turn the heater on.
And that's what I'm trying to do
is get them a stores.
that will always work that they
can rely on for their own a
breathing machine or hospital or
they're at the job board that
has the demand for power that
they have the power.
Will it rise and fall it always
does but
Even when it rises and falls it
always works and that's the
thing that we're we're missing
in New Mexico right now is a K.
to worst that is readily
available to our constituents
for their livelihoods.
Thank you Mr chair thank you
Representative Townsend
on that issue of sort of cost
which we talked a little bit
about
The prices did spike during
their during the summer
generally even though there's
been some differences sort
originally as you well know
with gas that source
specifically from New Mexico the
prices rose and it's my
understanding Mr chair
representative Townsend I
certainly saw this and
communities I come from that
there was a month to month
direct correlation and rise in
the cost of folks power bills
because the price of the fuel
natural gas when a and Mr chair
representative towns and it's
also my understanding that for
those New Mexicans who do
receive power
generated by natural gas many
are seeing those have seen
will again see as the prices
spike if and when they spike
we'll see month to month donor
built actually go up and I think
Mr chair representative Townsend
we've actually seen a few news
stories recently.
Where where costs have risen in
some cases thirty percent year
over year.
So Mister chair representative
at that thank you for that
that that is a large concern for
me based upon month to month
price increases now though I
want to go Mr chair
Representative Townsend
something Representative Scott
talked about which is sort of
the life cycle costs.
Would you say that the forty
year window Representative
mentioned by Representative
Scott is accurate for the life
of a combined cycle natural gas
plant.
Chair representative don't try
to address the things that you.
First to the the Economic
lifecycle of natural gas
certainly it's greater than ten
years and it's probably in line
with the forty year cycle.
But with that said.
But with that said.
The person in in.
That without power.
Our job is to make sure the
power is available.
Now with respect to the pricing
issue that you have dressed.
Let me state that I believe that
many of our policies in this
legislature.
Letting the bill that you
carried the ETA.
Is directly responsible for the
for these some of the spikes.
In our.
Because as we have taken on
these and and set the standards.
For some of these power
providers.
And we have set goals for them
to reach.
In their efforts to deploy
capital.
And to provide that magnitude of
power.
Knowing full well that they also
have to keep an off line
capacity.
Always available.
It has been detrimental to the
pricing of electricity in New
Mexico it has cost it
artificially rise.
And I don't know all the
McConnell most.
That looks at pass our pricing
in New Mexico that won't
substantiate that we have to be
careful when we drive these
producers to produce a power.
We have to also because of the
fact where that works twenty
four seven three sixty five
nobody in New Mexico wants part
time power nobody in New Mexico
can build a business.
Can you.
Run a hospital.
What time are in the path our
sources that we have driven
these people to do in today's
technology.
Will not work twenty four seven
three sixty five and all time
trying to do Representative is
to allow them the tool so they
can protect the people of New
Mexico.
All of those other things that
you mentioned the price go up
and down absolutely always has
always will.
But it always works.
And that's what I'm trying to
get to is the people of New
Mexico on the people United
States are not used to part time
password.
And businesses don't run on part
time part we haven't had to
curtail in New Mexico in a long
time but I remember when we had
to curtail in New Mexico.
And it's a painful process and
the legislature was tasked with
getting a source of power yeah
with that we got over that so
I'm all in for renewables I'm
all year round for economic
power I'm all in for all of
those being dispatchable but
today we don't have one that is
readily dispatchable and
renewables can't I mean they
can't work twenty four seven
three sixty five you know that.
I don't.
What I'm trying to do is bridge
the gap so we can get to the
point that we can thank you
thank you Mr thing
Representative I appreciate the
the extensive answer I'm trying
to stick to the bill Mr chair
representative Townsend so the
the first.
We did there was a brief
conversation about the history
of think it's pretty clear the
rise and natural gas drove out
cold.
we can talk more offline Mr
chair representative Townsend
the the month to month price
spikes that New Mexicans are
seeing now are due to the fuel
sources that earlier we heard
testimony would drive prices
down in fact there driving
prices up but this last point Mr
chair Representative Townsend
the question.
Thank you for for sort of
really honing in on
Representative Scott's window
forty year window.
If Mr Chairman representative
towns and we're gonna be
building a number of new
combined cycle natural gas
plants state and we'll say
thirty years instead of forty
say thirty.
That's three decades
That New Mexicans would be
paying for the cost of those
plans whether they run or not is
that accurate Mr chair
representative towns.
chair and representative I
understand care to start stay on
the bill.
But I have to drive you to the
point that the EPA that you
Kerry three hundred million
dollars a day of that.
Providers on the rate payers
backs in Albuquerque.
And that was not tribe
problematic to you.
Now the second thing I want to
bring up is that Representative.
The state San Juan our plant
shut down because it was
designed by law end date not
because of natural gas prices.
If you'll remember right we went
out of our way in the
legislature.
Add a ninety day window.
Without regard to natural gas
prices we did it because we
wanted.
Mexico to have power.
And we wanted to bridge that gap
of the highest peak demands
cease.
That's what this bill is about
it's not about the natural gas
price.
It's not about coal products
it's not about whether we and
works twenty four seven three
sixty five it's about allowing
our.
Our providers to have a tool in
their tool chest that meets the
demand.
That's all I'm trying to do is
meet that demand.
Of New Mexicans.
And I'm not trying to take.
The governor's you I'm just
laying on.
Here we are in the energy
committee.
Do you have a power sources do
you know of a power source that
works twenty four seven three
sixty five it is the economical
is natural gas today if you do
let's put it in this bill.
Mr Representative Townsend that.
Thank you for again for the
extensive comments Mr chair
representative Townsend the
reason I won't be able to
support this is the the two core
points one Mr chair
representative Townsend.
New Mexicans right now are
seeing their energy costs rise
based upon this fuel source the
proposal that you're bringing
forward to us today what
directly increase those costs
month to month that's what folks
folks are seeing right now and
and that the evidence is
expensive Mr chair
Representative Townsend although
we went a little bit far field
on the third question the truth
is building new combined cycle
natural gas plants now will is a
three to four decade investment
that New Mexicans will be paying
for for three or four decades so
this proposal not only is
showing that it raises prices
months to months but this will
be raising prices for an entire
generation even as technology
begins to advance so I think Mr
chair representative towns and
unfortunate I will be able to
support it because right now and
in the future this bill will
raise energy prices for New
Mexicans thank you Mr chairman.
Mr chair if I may so
This is just your question is
here for other people this like
to.
The change in the status.
Representative aber.
Thank you Mr chairman.
Mr chair representative of.
If I.
Recall.
The electric service provider
for our part of the story.
Prime our electric service
provider for part of the state.
Has several.
Gas plants we west of hops is
that actors.
Care two Representative that is
correct and I believe one of our
whole lives and leverage and
also as one of these types of
facilities and the community of
love actor.
Mr Chairman representative that
is correct and Mr chair
representative
Are there any other
Electrical generation plants
here
We we travelers Roosevelt County
that you're aware of other than
the three or four plants that I
just mentioned.
Mr chair Representative not that
I recall.
Mr Chairman representative of
up.
I don't recall either
and so we have some of this I'm
not sure that those three or
four plants are capable of
meeting the entire demand for
electricity in Southeast New
Mexico the.
The recent ones were built.
My recollection is were built to
assess.
And to supplement.
The large quantity of what
Christie that is come online
from renewable energy primarily
is that accurate.
Mr Chairman representative that
is correct.
And.
Mr chair representative.
I believe that we've been.
All by many utilities we have
contacts with the.
In order to have that one of the
of.
Renewable energy on their
wrists.
I have to have other sources.
That can make up.
Electricity where words of the
representative from San Juan the
Suns not shining or the wind is
not blowing.
And so.
Do we have the capability of the
meeting the demand today.
Have with the growth of
electricity in the future.
Without.
A stopgap measure that you're
proposing today.
Mr chair representative I'm not
aware of
Any source in New Mexico that
can bridge the gap other than
this technology.
We in southeast New Mexico
today are in cost much of Mexico
is still supported by cold quite
frankly that's from out of state
Mexico.
we are providing.
Tax incentives I R. P.'s for
this generation of how are in
New Mexico and the transmission
lines in New Mexico that
supported by taxpayers of New
Mexico but all that power is
going to California there is on.
Which is been really problematic
may for some time as you are
well aware.
but we continue to do that and
we're not taking care of our own
people and so we're spending tax
dollars New Mexico tax dollars
to take care of Arizona and
California.
we're not doing anything to take
care of New Mexicans and that is
what this is about is of as a
power source that allows New
Mexico.
To have.
A baseload power always
available.
And I will tell you
Representative that that that
Regardless of what my friend
from and you said.
The the cost of power in New
Mexico.
Has risen most significantly.
In the past few years.
But because of this body's
inability.
To set a tool in the tool chest
fires and in New Mexico so they
can make this transition as
technology advances and that's
what we are what we should have
done is we should allow our our
providers to have all the tools
available to provide New Mexico
with economical dependable how
are and then we should have
encouraged me
with with incentives that we
have toward eight zero based
carbon or cleaner fuel.
But to to do it in this manner
has harm the people of New
Mexico because they have had to
be more subjective to the to the
rise and fall of the
intermittent power providers
that are not.
Baseload power supply.
Mr Chairman representative my
point focusing on the eastern
New Mexico is a we are in the
fortunate position that.
Even if arsenal are electric
provider doesn't.
Bill any more generating plants
in New Mexico because they're
prohibited under the.
energy transition act.
We still get the benefit
because of the.
Laws and taxes that allow those
plants to be built and that's
primarily where a lot of our
energy comes from is is a state
of Texas primarily in the
panhandle well I still have a
coal plant the still have some
massive not only combined cycle
natural gas plants with the
traditional of boilerplate.
Our plans and we get our our
there's so many chairman Mr us
Representative the.
This effort I really see is not
really apply to your district or
my district due to really
helping out the.
The population centers in New
Mexico and trying to find a
mechanism for.
Them to reach.
Attain their reliable
dispatchable power and at the
same time.
Try to create this grants to to
hopefully brighter future with
with technology but it doesn't
exist.
So so Mister chairman and
Representative up.
No one has explained what a
combined cycle natural gas
facility is
I'd be happy to you might
briefly to the public you might
brief we tell them what type of
of plant this is and why it goes
hand in hand directly with
renewable energy.
Mr chair Representative combined
cycle technology is where he is
one fuel for the source and then
you take the sheet off of that
combustion and use it to drive
another source of power so
you're not only use in the field
but you're using the heat on top
of that we're in for another
source and it
enhances the efficiency of that
that the use of that natural gas
in this instance some Mr
Chairman representative.
The reason why this power can
ramp up quickly is you
investments have a jet engine if
you will that is run on natural
gas.
That turns a generator produces
electricity.
The exhaust is very hot it heats
a fluid that is and
Captures energy and then once a
second generator through the
production of steam like you
would have a regular boiler and
so you get this
to two sources of generation
electricity off the same energy
import as I understand it and so
technology has advanced as to
that point to be able to do it
but it wraps up.
State media we almost
immediately because that jet
engine starts immediately
generating electricity so when
the wind stops blowing or the
sun sets.
Those facilities can kick on and
quickly meet the demands of the
grid
Mr chairman and representative.
We have for our.
Electrical.
Companies you know we're a very
precarious position.
Because the.
The energy that's generated
electrons on the wires.
I have to
Stay with them very finite the.
Balances frequency if you will
and if it gets out of out of
kilter.
That's when we suffer brown's
blackouts the the the
transformers trip and people
don't have the ability to turn
on our.
So.
It's this technology that allows
at a media
Production of electrons to to
maintain the reliability of the
grid.
Adam in my opinion.
Mr chair representative Matt
reserves remain but my opinion.
We don't have any other.
Source or any other option at
this point in time to help these
companies maintain that balance
have.
Make the reliability and the
dispatchable energy
to their customers
Ninety nine percent guaranteed
do you agree with that Mr chair
representative I do agree with
that.
I don't see that New Mexico has
has a choice this time of you
know.
Mr Chairman representative but
talk about a sunset clause
there could be a different type
of sunset clause you can give Mr
Chairman you can give the
sunset clause ten years for the
construction of these facilities
but as Representative from Lee
County pointed up you need to
allow the cap recapture those
investment cost over a longer
period of time because that's
what the rate payers.
You could put ten years the cost
of electricity to the consumers
are probably a lot higher
because you're capturing those
cost over a shorter period of
time so it would make more
economic sense have a longer
recapture period did you can
have a ten year sunset on the
construction which would deal
with some of the issues we are
here today and still allow
companies to recapture the cost
and the consumers.
Hi a prize that it stands map to
recruitment of that investment
of capital over a longer period
of time making it more
affordable to the consumers.
But I would say Mr Chairman
representative we have no choice
we don't passes today.
There's going to be some
representatives from
Albuquerque.
Thank you for similar
legislation in the future
because it's the only mandate
that you have right now.
That makes the most and yeah I'm
gonna need many classes of past
couple years
that that's we conclude if we
don't embrace nuclear we don't
embrace some other technologies.
This is the only answer to the
problems that are associated
with
the.
One of the renewable energy we
have our food today.
So that we can.
Make that three and so I I just
I supported I could debate with
my friend next to me on on what
caused the gas prices decreased
and call plans to set them.
That's for another day.
Mr chair and representative
thank you for bringing this
weekend I don't think it affects
my constituents at all.
I think it certainly affects
citizens of the state we need to
do the right thing **** thank
you.
Yours Representative Dixon.
Thank you Mr chairman I just
have to questions and both are
related to.
Information in the FIR.
The first question
Is based on the attorney
general's analysis.
It says accordingly because
combined cycle gas turbines are
not zero carbon resources.
This amendment to the definition
of renewable energy would not
exempt these electric generating
resources from each agency
Mr chair Representative Townsend
just wondering if you have that
response to that.
Mr chair and representative the
staff the right.
I as I mentioned in my opening.
Natural gas is not a renewable
but it works.
And what I'm trying what I'm
trying to do is not argue with
the Attorney General over
definition I'm trying to arm
providers are providers in New
Mexico with the right tool and
as you and I both know the
Attorney General can change the
definition or we can help him
change the definition to meet
the people of New Mexico but
this isn't about in my.
In my.
My thought process was not
trying to beat around the sure
try to persuade one person over
another there's not another
power source in New Mexico that
will work so we need to adjust
the definition or adjust the
tourney General.
And that Mr chair and
Representative Townsend and I
apologize because I have a
follow up question okay which is
who is going to who are the tell
it is that are going to.
Purchase the collector city
from.
The gas.
It's pretty stupid doesn't.
That was an ETA guidelines that
they are subjected to.
Representative what I'm trying
to do is to encourage this
committee to help me craft the
bill that provides the power for
New Mexicans I
I.
Completely understand.
The contradictions and
definition.
But I also know.
That
if you give our power providers
a tool.
That works twenty four seven
three sixty five that is
dispatchable is economical and
they can put it in their rate
base they will use.
And every one of the that I talk
to says if you put this tool in
our tool box will use.
Thank you Mr chair and
representative I appreciate that
and I'm definitely aware of that
issues surrounding dispatchable
power and and the wonderful
thing about renewables at that
date don't always find our own
we need
I will go ahead and at.
My last question because I think
we sort of discussed it but I
just want to say that I I think
it's a noble goal to prevent
ground of
I don't know that I agree with
this being the next step thank
you.
Representative were you.
Thank you Mr chairman and
Representative Townsend
interesting discussion
the case well let you know that
I grew up in northern New Mexico
and I know a lot of people that
use.
Propane and gas and they
continue to do that probably
Southern New Mexico as well so I
just want to preface my comments
with that statement well I
represent Bernalillo county and
so my question is I have three
questions actually the first
question is really you keep
discussing Representative
Townsend and and I met yesterday
and I was delighted to meet you
by the way
You keep talking about the
number of people that rely on
gas and I just wondered if there
has been any kind of analysis
that because I don't see it
anywhere
your stand that my background is
planning so I rely on numbers
quite a bit but are there any
studies that tell me how many
people actually rely and would
be dependent on the sort of
Source of energy Representative.
I mean I have a feel for how
many people are we are affected.
Iraq's in years that's a good
question and I think the answer
is yes and and
I will reach out to the
committee to correct me if I'm
wrong but.
This is the under the our
current.
rules and regulations in New
Mexico.
X. if you exclude.
The impact of coproduced power
from our neighboring states to
come into the into New Mexico.
One hundred percent.
Of the population of New Mexico.
Is dependent on a dispatchable
power.
When my friend from San Juan
says when the wind doesn't blow
and the sun doesn't shine there
is another source in New Mexico
that's available
I guess we have a little influx
of of nuclear that comes in that
backs in the New Mexico but that
certainly.
Certainly Representative that's
a good question I think it is
all of New Mexico is now would
this is the pandemic up on a how
are.
Source.
That is is constructed to
natural gas.
When renewables are online.
So Representative Townsend Mr
chair
Yes but what you're telling me
is that a hundred percent of our
population New Mexico which is a
little over two million people
are relying on this.
My understanding.
Yes ma'am in Mr chair and
representative the issue is that
there is not and that natural
gas legislative power currently
available with these people that
is the issue the issue.
Well the.
The people of New Mexico in
particularly in and finally
County do not have.
A source.
That they can back up on.
cold call nights when the you
know when when renewables are
that because we don't have the
battery capacity.
And we don't have the internet
capacity from far away that
gives us our when that's not
occurring so that's about two
sixty five thousand.
Representative played lots of
people over to sixty.
Okay that was my first question
my second question
Representative Townsend and Mr
chair.
I'm sorry thank go backwards
sorry.
Mr chair and representative
Townsend thank you.
Actually that was my first
question is.
For my term
so my second question is with
regard to
efforts that are being made by
the industry and I appreciate it
Representative Nibert to
discussion so what we're in your
estimation efforts being made by
transition efforts being made to
transition the industry to clean
state and I heard the discussion
earlier and maybe that's the
answer but.
Since I'm new and I get to that.
Find out.
Mr chair and representative
The.
Providers in New Mexico continue
to be driven by the
ATA the renewable portfolio and
the girls that they're with to
provide eight eight clean power
source.
Certainly we have.
done quite a bit to clean up our
generation in New Mexico as we
shut down coal.
and picked up
more natural gas and in all of
the renewables that we've
brought online and certainly
that higher carbon footprint has
been.
Improved considerably because
of.
My the issue in New Mexico is
today is that the technology for
battery storage.
And for for dispatch ability has
not advanced as quick as we have
brought renewables solar and
wind on we don't have the
ability to store that so we can
use it at night that in the
absence or on those cold.
You know during the day we just
don't have the capacity.
The bridge that gap yet and what
this bill does is it allows the
power providers to have natural
gas online.
That they can use utilize to
support our constituents whether
and Bernalillo county or any
county inmate as a
representative I recommend this
not that that my County I don't
think that all I don't think
it's going to that the.
Many counties in New Mexico but
it is going to affect our most
populous counties and it will.
Our phones wall ring.
After the
if we allow.
Them to run out of power in the
coal mine that's all I'm trying
to do is give thank you.
Yes Representative Townsend
Here.
My last question and I would
love to have more information
about that particular issue
with regard to the co op
Association there was a
gentleman in the back and I
don't know if he's still here
who mentioned that the call up
Association supports this bill
and I just wonder how many co
ops Mr chair are involved in
that association the.
I don't believe he's here is a
very so.
The
last job.
Thank you Sir.
Chair representative I think
they're seventeen members of
that co op Association Matt
Paul.
Representative radios every last
question yes the.
Representative Sarinana.
Thank you Mr chairman.
Questions thank you for your
bills
so you keep referring to drugs
markets how many accounts do you
have the last year it could be
also coming up and we had a.
But I think
Some blackouts happen all the
time with regard to maintenance
and ongoing activities with them
I will tell you that you and I
both had been warned by PNM.
That that they have put it in
the paper on multiple occasions
that they don't have the
capacity in peak demand and we
may choose to disregard that we
may choose to settle that's
never happened before so we
don't we're not we'll worry
about it
but I don't believe that.
Our largest provider would
fraudulently the that warning
in to the news and without it
being credible and so I took it
is being very credible but
you're exactly right it has we
have not had a big groundout and
blacked out yeah.
And the some H. used to wait
until it happens to fix the
problem I don't.
Thank you second is more of a
COVID energy storage
energy storage locally is two
hundred eleven billion dollar
industry right now the project
by twenty thirty eight or thirty
billion dollar energy so energy
storage is here and we're going
to bring it to New Mexico.
Thank you.
Mr chair in the and secretary of
state on we will bring it to New
Mexico but it won't be
successful in New Mexico until
it's economical unless we force
it down our constituents
throughout at a higher price.
Mr chairman but we're using it
already I I went to current
efforts based other energy
storage they have they have
quite a bit there's no I am.
Disagree thank you.
Representative and Mr chair they
don't have a source it's big
enough to take care of
Albuquerque they do have some
prototypes that are very very
good but it's not ready yet or
they would be used in.
Thank you Mr.
Representative Montoya for
second time three.
Thank you Mr chairman there has
been a little bit session of
cost in this that was this one
that.
We saw cold go away next time Mr
chair we were looking.
At the cost per
kilowatt hour your call was
about five cents at that time
and natural gas was slightly
less than five cents per
kilowatt hour
that.
Was that of a lot of the
justification it's time I
remember the debates and I was
told how much more economical
natural gas was there was some
discussion of volatility which
we are now experiencing.
And currently if we had not
moved on from cold that would be
more of a constant lower priced
stores and especially so Mister
chairman and members sense we
then pass the premature closure
of the San Juan generating
station on to the consumer that
also added to the price.
Now Mr chair and members
what we're but what's also
happening to the Martian is the
fact that we are that they're
the.
Merchant market which can charge
a premium for on demand
electricity is contributing to
this increase so this did not
happen by itself the state not
happen in a vacuum this did not
happen organically.
We did it as a legislature.
but that to the idea of us the
in this this be my washer COVID
Mr Chairman to the idea of.
All of getting a natural gas
source online that it needed to
go forty years to recoup the
cost.
That would be perfectly fine if
we would embrace
a technology that it currently
exists.
That we're gonna be talking
about.
During this legislative session
concerning hydrogen.
And that is the concept of
sequestration of carbon.
We can do that with natural gas
combined cycle plants as well.
And it would not be nearly as
expensive as it is going to be
to to divide the methane.
And the carbon out so we can
have hydrogen.
And Nancy Questor the card we
can do that currently that
technology exists it has been
proven in large scale and we
could do it with natural gas and
we would then have no concern of
carbon emissions yes we did not
just wholeheartedly I
determined.
That we're gonna get rid of any
additional get rid of all
sources of energy that's that
come from fossil fuels so like I
said there there's a push for
hydrogen
it would make more sense to do
this with natural gas and then
we would have more power source
Reliable and because there are
credits from the federal
government to sequester carbon
it could keep that price down
for our citizens this is an
answer to a problem that we
really should examine if our
concern is not just the
environment but our constituents
who are reliant upon the energy
that's produced thank you Mr
chairman.
Thank you Representative
Montoya.
Sexual comments myself
Just like deserve we have been.
Almost one as a result of the
transition
Rather.
IDC Representative is a very
long actually full full the
there was planning for a future
date the very ability of our.
have the we have a project in
the.
Beijing remains the one of the
supply disruption of.
I disagree that the
closing in San Juan generating
station.
and I believe San Juan
generating station sorry have.
It is a pleasure economic
reasons
we are undergoing a transition
that transition of the will
happen
with or without legislative
action because the rules are
awesome.
expect that to continue
I also.
To someone who is going on
permits you to restoration.
I agree that that station
the only reason
I.
so I'd get back to the the
analysis of this bill and
sentences of the statement.
Recognizes that.
also.
Natural gas is not.
The server Act.
the four X. of the motion
Representative thousands getting
funding to ensure.
Very briefly I appreciate your
comments
Chair
Yes
thank you recruit.
All of us as legislators to take
the wise advice of.
Providers is being straight up
and honest I I I agree with you
that so.
A transition is is going on.
two my friend vice chair for her
comments I would just say that
just the battery technology
comes you can take the life
cycle of a guests
today.
You can cut it in force.
I can live from forty years to
ten years.
And you can load that base.
that ten year supply and it's
still four times cheaper.
They and large scale battery
capacity is today.
So the technology is there.
But it is not economical it was
economical we wouldn't be having
this discussion today we don't
have the technology.
But it is it's good staff it'll
come around in a point in time I
don't want to people's being to
separate them in the meantime
that's my point.
Thank you Sir.
Thank.
Senator any on the tentative to
table.
The motion tables are secretary
secretary.
Representative small.
Ciation you to the.
Representative break up yes.
Representative Dixon.
Yes.
Representative Garcia.
Representative Montoya.
Representative Nibert.
No to table.
Representative Rubio yes to

Representative Scott.
No need to.
To.
Start.

Representative Townsend noted
that.
Representative Sarinana.

But the seven the for the bills
As.

long term all we'll all.
Which.
Therefore.
To use that.
The general description.
The course for your warm.
The.
And we do.
Thank you.
Thank.
Thank you.
Thank you representative that
was understands is
