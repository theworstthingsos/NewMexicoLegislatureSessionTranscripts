This, this is really, uh, you

I, I, I came from two cultures,
two backgrounds.
On my, uh, father's side.
I was always raised by my abuelo
who would, who, uh, uh, gentle
lady, my, my brother would say,
we come from the valley of the
gods and, and, and, and as
Aslan, so
he always told us that, you
know, be proud of who you are as
a Hernandez because we come from
the valley of the gods. And
then, uh
Gentle lady, my, my father, my
late father, he, he always kept
us in touch with our customary
traditions. We went to sweat
lodge ceremonies as a youth, we
went to Powwows uh in Colorado
and I, I dance. I, I, I was a
grass dancer, gentle lady. I, I,
I participated in, in, in, in
numerous events, uh, in, in a
community gatherings is what we
call it in the urban communities
uh
And, and general lady, um, you
know, the, the significance of,
of, of, of that, you know, when
I was growing up in our public
education department that there
was a, a, uh, a bridge that we
crossed over then to know now
that, no, the gentle lady, uh,

I rise in support in solidarity,
in spirit with all of us today.
And I invoke.
The name names.
Of my grandparents I won't go
far back as.
My colleague representative uh
Hernandez referenced because
My ancestry dates.
As all of us back time
immemorial.
But I do invoke the name of my
grandfather Vicente.
Royal
My grandmother
Isidra Royal.
My father, Felipe Trujillo
Royal.
Because they have been.
They lived a life of suffering.
They lived a life of separation
from their families.
Being sent to the boarding
schools.
Their language was removed from
them.
Their cultural traditions were
removed from them.
They were forced to undergo.
Horrible
Living conditions.
And it is because of them.
And all of the previous
generations.
That we honor.
Them and all on this day.
It is important not only to
celebrate.
What we bring to the table.
But to commemorate
And honor the lives.
That were given literally in
death.
In order for us to be here
today.
I bring this message because I.
In my tribal tradition come from
the Cacia family.
Which the cacique and our tribe.
Or the spiritual, cultural, and
traditional leaders of our
tribe.
And
It's important.
For the young people who may be
listening.
To understand.
What my colleague also.
Mentioned and that is that.
We have, we were.
We have been.
We are today and we are the
future.
And they
And I and all of those before me
stand on the shoulders.
Of those who had to suffer.
In order for us to be here
today.
So I'm so happy.
To be part of our.
Celebration and commemoration
today and I thank the gentle
lady and all of my colleagues
for acknowledging us today.
Thank you. Thank you, gentle
lady, uh, folks, I'll call your
attention to the rostrum to my
right. We have a very, very,
very special guest. He is the
great, great grandfather of the
gentle lady from Burnleyoibola
McKinley San Juan Socorro
Valencia Representative Abeta.
His name is Burton Plao.
He was in the US Naval Service,
US Air Force, and served during
World War II and the Korean
conflict. He is 100 years young.
Welcome to the house, Mr. Plao.
Mhm.
I'd like to repeat, I have never
been in this area before.
But I'm very uh grateful.
To see how many people who are
Working for
Uh
The people of the states in
Mexico.
And also, um,
Uh, the people to serve in the
uh servers and the various
areas.
Like all uh all military.
Uh insulations.
I don't, uh, serve that much,
but I, uh,
But I'm grateful that I
In my mind, I, uh,
I like to think that I did
serve.
Uh, the residents of New Mexico.
And I, uh,
Not to uh
Continue in a different way.
As a civilian, uh, in civilian
life.
But it's very hard to get into
any uh competition.
Because we have a lot of good
competitions.
And you cannot fight him.
And then somehow you can uh get
through it.
But I'm gonna try one of these
days, see if I can.
Get uh through that and uh
I worked uh in this area.
If any military can uh
Do uh
I love to work with the enemy
against the enemy.
I think a person qualified for
this area.
Well, probably
Be just as good.
are probably better.
And I thank each one.
Each one of you. Thank you.
gentle lady from McKinley, uh,
from Bern Leo.
Representative Thompson. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker, um, I rise in
support of this memorial, um, as
I've said recently, I grew up on
the Navajo and um Representative
Johnson is younger than me, but
she played with my sister in
Crown Point.
And I, my first years were on
the Cheyenne River Sioux
Reservation in South Dakota and
we go to the dances and as a
little kid I remember being
terrified of the clown dancers.
I don't know why they, they had
masks or paint and I was just
terrified, but, but I consider
Crown Point my home and um
welcome to all and thank you for
all you do. Thank you for
bringing this memorial, madam.
Thank you. And gentle lady, I'm
pretty sure the gentle lady from
McKinley and San Juan yielded to
you. I'm, I'm pretty sure I
heard that, gentlemen from
Katherine Grant
and Hidalgo represent rasas you
Mr.
Speaker,
with the gentle lady please
yield?
I yield to the kind gentleman,
my colleague in house labor
veterans Committee.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, uh, let me tell you, thank
you so much for this, um.
This memorial, thank you for
bringing this. It's a beautiful
thing to see all the kids, the
culture, um, the American Legion
everyone come in together to to
show support for this beautiful
event.
I also, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, want to tell you that you
know where I live it's the
Mimbrenos are down, that was
where the world the Mimbres
spots, the beautiful, um, uh,
cliff dwellings. We have so much
hieroglyphics on the dragon fly
fly trail. It's just a a
beautiful thing to see what, you
know, what they brought in the
culture they brought to our
area. I, I'm so glad that you
brought this. Thank you so much
and you always do a great job
for your district.
And for your people. God bless
you thank you Mr. Speaker.
Is there further debates, the
gentleman from Rio Aba Sandoval
in San Juan, Representative
Linte.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Will a
gentle lady from McKinley County
and San Juan County, please
yield.
I yield to the kind gentleman.
Thank you.
Yeah, I, I didn't think the
speaker was gonna come to me for
a while.
I, I have a hard time seeing out
of this
I,
I, I, I.
cherishsh this day uh for a
number of reasons.
Probably likely because uh those
of us that are in the.
The uh native caucus find
ourselves oftentimes huddling
together, trying to figure out
how we can do things to better
the lifestyles and the
livelihoods of people of where
we come from, right? The, the,
the first Americans as it, as it
would be.
And as we talk and deliberate
about how do we improve lives
and lifestyles from our most
elder of of citizens to those
that are
Uh, the most youngest and
innocent to even those that are
unborn.
We, we talked a lot about
standing on the shoulders of
giants, recognizing that
I work here.
We stand on those shoulders
because people led the way for
people like us from communities
like us to where a society like
this, a governmental entity like
this was never created for
people like us.
And I further say that to
recognize even those that come
not indigenous to North America.
But indigenous to this
continent, right? And I include
my brothers and sisters from the
furthest down south part of, of
South America, Mexico, all those
other places because you are
just as in as indigenous as I
am.
You have a right to be here just
as much as I do.
And when we talk about
recognizing, understanding,
appreciating, empathizing,
sympathizing about the things
that our people have gone
through to give us a shot to be
here so that maybe we could have
a voice in the 70 chair chamber
or that maybe we could have a
voice in the larger arena of New
Mexico to make a change. That's
what today represents.
That's why you have children
dressed in their regalia,
dressed in their in their
cultural best to come here to,
to, to represent where they're
from.
Not only just them, but you also
have the most oldest and elder
members of our communities.
Just as proud knowing that this
society and the governmental
structures of the federal
government, especially sought to
erase those most elders have
been in our of our community.
That's why I see a gentleman
like that was on the rostrum
just a while ago. I'm glad I
didn't go right after him
because it's difficult because I
see him and I hear him and I
know that likely he was probably
one of those people that went
to.
In in in school.
It was likely one of those
people that went to an Indian
school suffered the consequences
of speaking his own language
except for the consequences of
not looking like.
Somebody that maybe he, people
thought that he shouldn't look
like, so his hair was chopped,
right? And, and, and, and the
abuse was started and you think
about those.
And I think about how far we've
come from that point to where we
are today.
And I think about the schools
and and and recognizing that
just right down the street, the
Santa Fe Union School, a school
developed to help abolish and as
simulate our people to be much
more like mainstream America now
has one of the leading.
And is one of the leading
institutes for our children,
Native American children where
they're graduating in numbers
far beyond our expectations.
Going to colleges that we could
have only dreamt of.
Because we've been able to
change our priorities change our
ideals change the way people see
us.
And so as we stand here,
Whether you're
Or irregardless of if you are a
Democrat or a Republican. If you
come from the north side of the
state, south side, East side,
West side. Don't matter where
you come from, today is a
special day because we recognize
and we share in the beauty of
our diversity in New Mexico. We
recognize that this is a home to
not just one of a people, but to
many of the people.
We recognize and we see the
beauty that if we can celebrate
today like this every day it'll
make New Mexico that much more
stronger. So for those of you
that have traveled from
throughout our state from all of
the pueblos from all of the, the
nations, uh, Naval Nation
chapters from all the tribes,
the Hickory and Mescalero, Forti
Apache tribes. Welcome to your
house.
For those of you that serve with
us in this house, welcome to
your house. Keep serving in your
house because there's a whole
lot more chairs in this house
for people like us. Thank you.
Gentle lady from Bernalilloibo
McKinley, San Juan Socorro, and
Valencia, Representative Abeta.
Thank you, Speaker. Will the
gentle lady from McKinley yield?
I yield to the kind gentle lady,
our newest member of our native
caucus.
Yeah
Speaker, I rise to support this
American Indian Day Memorial,
uh, speaker, I'm a proud member
enrolled with the Navajo Nation
from Tuille, New Mexico where I
was raised by my grandmother,
and thank you so much everyone
for welcoming my 100 year old
great grandfather to the floor.
I spoke with him moments after
and he said it was the most
amazing view he's ever seen, and
he's never been on this floor
before in his 100 years of life.
I rise and support on behalf of
my entire district and all
American Indians today, the ones
who've come before us. I'm the
daughter of a boarding school.
Student I'm the granddaughter of
a boarding school student and
the policy that has impacted my
family and I still felt today.
I'm proud to still live on the
Navajo reservation with my
family where I'm raising my
children in a tribally
controlled school where we have
the oversight of the curriculum
and it's paramount to what's
going to guide their life, and I
think all the voters in my
district for selecting me to
represent them here in this
house because it's open doors
and as you see in this morning
we opened the doors to hundreds
of indigenous children that can
come fill these rooms and these
spaces with us and dream to be
here with us.
one day and to all of our
visitors in the gallery welcome
home. Thank you for being here
and to those who can't be here
with us today. We're thinking of
you and we're holding your
spirit. Thank you for sponsoring
this memorial, Madam Chair,
yeah.
Thank you, gentle lady.
The gentle lady from Katherine
Sierra Socorro Valencia
Representative Armstrong.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, my
friend from uh McKinley and San
Juan Yield. I yield to my good
friend.
Thank you, uh, kind lady, I
stand in solidarity with
American Indian Day.
I, uh, am.
Friends, neighbors, family.
Uh, to, to all the people, uh,
I, I hail from Magdalena, New
Mexico.
Where my friends and my
neighbors and my family are from
Alamo, Navajo, specifically.
And I stand saying,
We cannot forget the past.
But we can change the future.
And we stand together for the
people.
For all people.
All
Ethnicities. I'm not the same
color. I am judged like many of
you are, for the color of my
skin.
My children were judged for the
color of their skin like many of
your children are.
So you do not stand alone.
We feel
I have felt personally.
things that you have felt.
We need to learn from the past.
And not repeat the past, but we
shall not forget.
Or we will repeat.
So I stand in solidarity with my
friends and my family.
And uh walking beauty.
Walking beauty.
Walk and beauty. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker.
Thank you, gentle lady.
gentle lady from Bern Leo Roal
Caballero, you have a couple of
guests on the rostrum.
Thank
Speaker
And um as I mentioned earlier
that I come from the uh.
Cacique family and I explained
that the cacique.
Is the cultural and traditional
leaders of our tribe.
And it's a long the Royal family
has a very long, long history.
As being from the cacique and as
I mentioned earlier, having gone
through um.
The terrible atrocities.
A boarding schools, so I'd like
to at this time.
Introduce
Our cacique.
My cousin.
And the leader
Cultural leader of our tribe,
the Pito Manzo Tiwa tribe Pueblo
of San Juan de Guadalupe.
Ed Royal.
And Mr. Speaker, he's
accompanied by his daughter
Holly Roiba of the tribal
council.
Welcome to the house.
Gentle lady from Bernard Leo
Representative Borego. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker, um, I would
just stand and gentle lady
yields.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the
general lady yield.
I yield, Mister Speaker. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. Um, I stand in
support of this um
Of this bill, I think that
what's really important is that
uh many years ago we used to
talk about um New Mexico being a
tri-cultural and now we talk
about it being a multicultural
state, um, and I'm glad that
that, that definition has
changed because we are truly a
multicultural state and that
that is what makes us a stronger
state in the union because we
Appreciate and we accept all
nationalities and having grown
up in Espanola.
Which, uh, northern New Mexico.
I grew up with my brothers and
sisters from San Juan, from
Santa Clara, from Picqueri from
Taos, many of who I went to
school with and grew up in my
mom's house, um, so we all grew
up together, not actually
knowing that any of us were
different than any others, um,
and, um.
One of the things that I
appreciate my father after he
retired from Los Alamos and
Mother opened a jewelry store,
so we knew many of the natives
that came to um our little store
and traded uh silver and silver
beads for um things that were
sold in our business, um, the
thing that that was really great
about that is that.
It taught me.
You know, because many
oftentimes they invited me to
their feast days and so we spent
a lot of time at the feast days
and it was just like home. They
always welcomed us home and so I
just wanna say that um I truly
appreciate, um, Madam Leader,
that you brought this forward.
Thank you. Thank you gentle
lady, uh, seeing no further
debate, I'll add my words, uh,
of, of gratitude, gentle lady
for bringing the memorial
forward for hosting us today on
this very special American Union
Day.
And also I'd like to reiterate
that uh we are on the land of
indigenous people. This is
indigenous land, and we should
not celebrate one day during
legislative session, it should
be celebrated and it should be a
practice every single day
because we are for the most
part, most of us guests uh on on
on indigenous land, uh, before I
go to you to close, I'd also
like to invite members of the
gallery, the audience who have
traveled here for this special
day to please, please rise and
be recognized.
I know you traveled from far and
wide to be here.
I'm glad you're here.
The gentle lady from McKinley in
San Juan to close.

House Memorial 17 introduced by
representatives.
Johnson and Josh, Joseph
Hernandez, a memorial declaring
February 7, 2025, American
Indian Day in the House of
Representatives, whereas New
Mexico is home to 23 sovereign
Native American nations, tribes
and pueblos whose people are
citizens of both New Mexico and
their sovereign nations, tribes,
and pueblos, and whereas decades
ago, the state of New Mexico in
its wisdom set apart a day each
year to be known as
American Indian Day in
recognition of the many
contributions of Native
Americans to the economic and
cultural heritage of all
citizens of the United States.
And whereas the legislature
takes great care to recognize
and support the immeasurable
contributions that Native
American people have made to New
Mexico to make New Mexico great.
And whereas the federal Indian
citizenship Act, which extended
United States citizenship to all
Native Americans born within the
United States and its
territories was signed into law
in 1924 but did not include the
right to vote.
And whereas Miguel Trujillo,
born in Pueblo of Isleta in
1904, enlisted in the United
States Marine Corps after the
attack on Pearl Harbor and
recruited Native Americans to
join the military, including
some who later became Navajo
code talkers. Trujillo felt that
as a citizen and a veteran, he
had a right to vote, but his
attempt to register to vote in
1948 was denied. He brought a
court case and one guaranteeing
all Native Americans in New
Mexico the right to vote.
And whereas in 1942, the United
States Marine Corps recruited
the 1st 29 Navajo code talkers
who spoke both Navajo and
English and helped devise a code
that more than 400 Navajo code
talkers eventually used, and
Japanese linguists never
decoded. At the end of World War
II, the code talkers were sworn
to secrecy about their work and
the secret program was not
revealed to the public until
1969.
In 1982.
August 14th was declared
national Code Talkers' Day, and
whereas the first Native
Americans to serve in the New
Mexico legislature, both began
and served in the same years,
1965 and 1966. Representative
James at City, who served San
Juan County and Representative
Monroe Jim, who served McKinley
County, the first Native
American woman to serve in the
New Mexico legislature was Linda
M. Lovejoy, who served in House
districts 69 from 19.
89 to 1998, and Senate District
22 from 2007 to 2012 and was the
first Native American woman
senator and the first Native
American to serve in both
chambers of the legislature.
And whereas the current list of
New Mexico Native American
legislators includes.
Representative D Wanda Johnson,
House District 5, Navajo.
Representative Derek J. Linte,
House District 65, Pueblo Evista
and Pueblo of Sandia.
Representative Charlotte Little,
House District 68, Pueblo of San
Felipe, Representative Patricia
Roybal Caballero, House District
13, Piro Manso Tiwa pueblo of
Guadalupe.
Representative Michelle Michelle
Pauline Abeda, House District
69, Navajo.
Representative Joseph Franklin
Hernandez, House District 4,
Navajo. Senator Benny Shino Jr.
Senate District 22, Pueblo of
Jeez, Senator Shannon De Pinto,
Senate District 3, Navajo, and
Senator Angel M. Charlie, Senate
District 30, Pueblo of Laguna
and Navajo.
And whereas contemporary life in
New Mexico is deeply enriched by
the cultural, artistic,
economic, social, religious, and
political aspects of its Native
American people and communities.
And whereas Native Americans are
the original inhabitants of this
state and have overcome great
devastation and misfortune.
And whereas the experiences of
Native Americans in New Mexico
provides substantial enrichment
to the state and are worthy of
great esteem. Now, therefore, be
it resolved by the House of
Representatives of the state of
New Mexico that February 7th,
2025 be declared American Indian
Day in the House of
Representatives and be it
further resolved that copies of
this memorial be transmitted to
the governor and the secretary

It is a good day to be native.
It is always a good day to be
native from New Mexico.
Where the sun, the pueblo sun
symbol is our state flag.
And it is that symbol that
unites us all.
We are so thankful.
Even for a brief moment.
A shared sense of peace from all
walks of life.
From the four directions.
The Four Seasons.
The 4 times of day.
And the 4 cycles of life.
Yard A once again.
All is good.
To all of our governors, our
tribal chairman or tribal
presidents, women, elders,
veterans, and our most precious
children.
Welcome to your house.
The House of Representatives.
Our state of New Mexico.
The House of Representatives,
which I am a proud member.
And our Senate colleagues.
As well as our executive and
judicial branches. Welcome.
Thank you for your presence,
your leadership, and your
advocacy.
And your support as we work
together for our communities and
constituents.
Today we stand and sit together
as one.
To recognize our distinct
history.
The footprints of our ancestors
who continued to guide us from
behind the stars.
Our state of New Mexico is
unique.
Because of our different pueblos
tribes and native nations and
our individual sovereign rights.
Today we are also facing issues
and challenges that demand our
communication coordination and
collaboration.
The federal executive orders
that strike that core of our
democracy and ways of life.
The rising crime rates, the
homelessness to the threats of
schools and students and
children.
To the changing climate that is
impacting our environment.
To rising cost of food,
gasoline, and everything we need
to make a living.
The influx of AI just to name a
few.
With that said, ladies and
gentlemen.
In the most humble way and
respectful way I know how.
I will now introduce our tribal
leaders beginning with the
honorable Boonnarin, president
of the Navajo Nation.
Hello,
thank you for that pat on the
back. That was a good one. Every
once in a while, you need one of
those. So again, I just want to
say thank you, thank you so much
for allowing me to share a few
words. I know that 2 years ago,
you all allowed me to share some
words with you all as well too.
So again, I commend each and
every one of you for the work
that you do as senators, as
representatives, and speaker.
Thank you so much for allowing
me to be in your house and uh
Representative Johnson, if you,
uh, thank you to our Navajo
representatives. I know, uh,
Miss, uh, Representative B.
here and Mr. Hernandezate, thank
you for, for all the good work
that you do and all of our
tribal representatives and as
well and our leaders in this
room. So on behalf of the Navo
Nation, I want to say thank you
to all of our members, our
Pueblo leaders, our tribal
leaders, uh, from the Navajo
Nation, our our local leaders
from our grazing officials to
our chapter presidents, to our
council delegates. Thank you for
the work that you can
continually do for our
communities at the local level
as well, but on behalf of the
nation, it's always an honor to
be here because, uh
great state of New Mexico has
always been so gracious to work
with tribal nations as well. Uh
we, we always continue to try to
thrive for the relationships
that we have here to try to
replicate in Arizona and Utah,
but New Mexico treats us with
all due respect, and you truly
do honor tribal sovereignty. You
work together, you, you back it
up by funding us with dollars
that really impact our
communities on a day to day
basis. So again, with the, the
funding that you send our way
also challenge
challenges our system to figure
out how do we come up with
solutions, how do we come up
with ways to really, cause today
marks 50 days of tribal
sovereignty or
self-determination and how can
we continue to work together and
with that challenge that you
guys bring us every single year.
Thank you so much for the great
state of New Mexico for sending
dollars to tribes on a year to
year basis, yeah.
And again, thank you to the 23
tribal member of tribal nations
that are here. I know from
Pueblo's to Apaches, to Navajo,
to, to the surrounding nations
that are constantly here day to
day. So again, without uh
indigenous, we want to be the
land of enchantment. So thank
you to all the leaders that are
here today. I think they deserve
a round of applause themselves
too, so.
And if you're sitting next to
them that pat on the back worked
real good for me earlier too, so
if you want you can give him one
of them. And so again, uh, just
here to share a few words on
just really the thankfulness and
Navajo means thank you and uh we
don't know how many times we can
say thank you to each and every
one of you, whether you're a
Republican, Democrat, and really
you push to make sure that it's
bipartisan when it comes to our
native issues because we really
do our very best because our,
our Navajo people, our native
people were always there at the
forefront of.
To figure out how do we make
sure that we make the great
state of New Mexico look good
whether it's our artwork or
songs, our prayers, our
soldiers, and our children and
everything along those lines. So
again, I'm always honored to be
here because it's hard to give a
speech among people who really
have a heart of giving a heart
to serve and a commitment to
really make New Mexico one of
the best places for indigenous
people to live, learn, and also
move. So again, that's what you
guys do on a day to day basis.
So thank you for that and I know
that.
also want to thank the
administration, uh, Governor
Lujan and uh Lieutenant Governor
Morales as well for all the work
that you guys do to make sure
that your secretaries, your
departments are working with
tribal nations. I know one of
the successes I want to share
with the legislative body, the
executive body as well too is I
know last year the Navajo
Nation, we had a hard time, the
1st 6 months we only spent about
$2 million but within the last 6
months of 2024 with Secretary
Monet and the team coming out
with James Mountain. We were
to spend $12 million so that's
a, a multifold with the support
that we got from the
administration. So thank you,
and I know that some of the work
that you guys do with all the
other tribal nations as well. So
yeah.
And, and one of the solutions
that came out of a lot of our
discussions, I know some of the
other tribal nations are are
doing in this, how do we
continue to hire different types
of managers, project managers,
and things like that. So one of
the avenues we decided to go
down is indefinite delivery,
indefinite quantity IDIQ to hire
4 firms to help us really try to
manage, how do we make sure we
get capital outlay projects all
the way to the, all the way to
the finish line because a lot of
our local chapters, they submit
a lot of their own requests. So,
so when they, when they
sometimes
submit their requests that they
might have a little shortfall or
some challenges, and that's
where as, as an Aition
government, the state of New
Mexico, to really come together
and say, no, let's come up with
tangible solutions so that these
much needed projects like power
lines, water lines, senior
centers, and even trying to get
dollars out to our elders is
implemented. So that's one of
the things that we're launching
the uh launching over the past
several months. The other thing
we looked into doing is how do
we encourage our tribal
enterprises. I know a lot of our
tribal nations here today.
Have their own tribal
enterprises. So one of the
things we established is a
partnership with Navajo
Engineering Construction
Authority, so they already build
water lines and septic tanks,
uh, drain fields, and they do a
lot of those projects anyway.
Why can't we release some of
these projects to them so that
they can do those projects a lot
quicker because they're an
extension of the Navajo Nation
as well, and we've done the same
thing with our Navajo tribal
Utility Authority as well.
Continental Divide Electric,
Jimenez, uh, mountain Electric
Cooperative City of Farmington
utility Services. So these
agreements are a way for us to
come back year after year and
say, you know what, we're coming
up with uh avenues whether the
MOAs or agreements with people
that have their hearts in the
right place, which is putting
these projects in place so that
we can see them and utilize
them. So, so again, that's one
of the things that we've really
been working on again as we
continue to move forward, uh, I
want to say thank you so much to
each and every one of you
because you guys have supported
us when it comes to public
safety, we've got one project
that's almost completed, uh, it,
it, we broke ground on it, which
is the Shira.
Incident command center, so New
Mexico Capital Alley because our
people are working out of a post
office right now and through
your generosity, we actually
started to break ground. We're
still short a few million
dollars, but we said, you know,
let's just break ground, pray
and hope that we can get
additional support. So that's
one of the things our EMTs, our
firefighters, our police
officers will be able to look at
a really nice facility in the
largest community, which is
Shibrock, New Mexico. So again,
those fundings that came from
you all, thank you so much, and
I know there's a lot of bills
and a lot of plans.
go before you guys. So I commend
you, cause even looking at that
list on the amount of projects
that the nation submits and the
other tribal leaders that are
submitting again commend you,
commend you, thank you so much.
And the other thing, as
mentioned earlier, which was the
tribal regalia, which is gonna
be coming before the bodies
before, and I wanna say thank
you for thinking about our
indigenous students so that they
can wear their, their eagle
feathers, uh, be able to have
their, their, their aunties,
their aunts or themselves to
really design a lot of their cap
and gown so that they can be
proud because that might be the
only.
time they cross the cross to get
a, to get a certificate or
diploma. So this might be the
best time that they can really
do this. So again, I want to say
thank you. I know that I, I
forgot to mention my wife might
be listening, so, uh, former
Arizona state representative
Jasmine Blackwater Nyren, the
first, uh, Native American
county attorney in the state of
Arizona as well. She was a
champion at the state
legislature a couple of years
ago and she got that through the
House and the Senate, and I
think Governor
the governor signed off.
on it. So again, really, I
commend her for that, and I look
forward to win that, uh,
legislation is actually signed
by Governor Newhon as well. So
thank you for those parts so
that we can continue again,
we're here today because of our
language and our culture and our
ways of life, and we're
constantly trying to promote it
because even on the Navajo
Nation, we might have the most
amount of Navajo speakers, but
that's constantly declining, but
with your efforts and your
support so people can walk
around and be proud to be
indigenous, that almost helps
them to say, you know what, let
me learn my language.
Let me learn my culture. I'm
not, not have been raised on
those avenues, but I can, if I
can walk across and get my high
school diploma and be proud. So
those are avenues that you guys
are constantly working on. So
again, thank you so much to
representative Sin, uh, Mr.
Sendo, where's? I was in a yawn
when I look at him
Oh man, Mr. Sendo and uh
representatives uh Johnson as
well. So again, in conclusion,
just I don't know what else to
say to such a phenomenal group
of people that have their hearts
and minds.
in the right place to make New
Mexico really be the land of
enchantment because what you
guys do in such a short period
of time is unmatched, so thank
you, thank you on behalf of the
nation. I will continue to do
what we can and really take the
funding and the legislations you
send our way to make sure that
we implement them at, at the
best of our abilities, and you
all are thinking for the future
that's in Navajo is Ya thinking
for the future, which is what
are our children gonna need in
about 10 years, 20 years, 50
years down.
the road, and you guys are
planting the seeds on a day to
day basis so on behalf of the
Great Navajo Nation and on
behalf of all the tribes that
are here today. I want to
commend you and I look forward
to also the education bill to
really go through that the 23
tribes that are gonna really
support it as well too, so yeah,
yeah,
and uh God bless the great uh
state of New Mexico and all the
tribal nations that make it very
colorful and really culturally
rich. So thank you, I go it.
he had he had uh
Thank you President Nyren.
Members of the House and
colleagues from the Senate and
guests, I was remiss to also
include the Fort Apache and also
the Piero Manoti Pueblo
of San Juan de Guadalupe in my
uh inclusion in my remarks, so
thank you with that, I now
recognize and introduce the
honorable Adrian Natine.
President of the Hickoria Apache
tribe.
Mr. Speaker.
Good afternoon, everyone.
No, it's real tough when you
follow our speakers such as
NaO president, you know.
I don't
I've been asked to see.
What are the different events,
different meetings, different uh
settings, but, uh, this one is
uh
Very important to the point
where I learn a few words down.
The impromptu side of
speechmaking is the not a good
fit for this area.
So
I got about 12 pages. Hope you
guys.
Can bear with me.
There were times when I did
speak at that.
At the high school
When they're doing a welcoming
back in the.
First part of the fall.
That's one of the questions I
always ask, how much time do I
have?
So
I want to thank every one of
you.
For being here, for doing what
you guys do.
I know it's tough.
Being a
An elected leader.
There's a a lot of things that
go to it.
I think one of the parts that
uh.
It's not really mentioned.
As much as it should be is that
the family really gets affected.
My granddaughter spoke to me a
couple of years back and said,
uh,
Papa
You should get your old job
back.
And why do you say that?
So because you're never home.
That's how much it affects them.
But uh
And this last round,
I ran for office again as a
councilman, and I lost my 3
votes, but uh let you think.
But it gave me time to also
Work in a different setting.
I was a teacher at the high
school for 3 years.
I got him with the culture and
language.
My background as a highway
engineer.
A green civil engineer from New
Mexico State.
But the PED guidelines say you
have to have a master's. So I
wasn't able to teach basic
algebra.
Those kind of
Settings, guidelines that uh
Public education department kind
of put up roadblocks for us.
But I did get in with the
cultural and language
certification, which is good to
2031.
So when I'm finally done with
this side of
Working for the people, maybe I
can go back as a teacher.
Which which I enjoyed very much.
It was, it was tough to leave
that setting.
It was a hard choice to make,
but to this day, my students
still wave at me when I'm
walking across the parking lot
going into our local.
Grocery store.
I know they miss me being inside
that building with them.
There was a time when a, when I
first walked into the high
school.
Walked into the doors there.
The response was,
Welcome, Mr. Natsy.
So thank you
It's good to be here with you.
It's a good day.
It's, it's always a good day
when I'm amongst the youth.
It brings you, it lifts you.
Makes you think of different
areas of uh.
Of your community.
Which I enjoyed quite a bit and
then I
Read it again that it was tough
leaving that setting, but I'm
still doing work for them.
I visited the schools almost
daily.
If it's not by a phone call,
it's.
Walking into a classroom.
You should see the way they
light up.
The smiles.
The laughter, the joy.
That
Their own community members
bring to them.
It lets them show that you're
there for them.
So that's how I kind of work.
My setting where I'm at now.
As a
I go into my speech.
That's going to speak in our,
our language.
The Hickory language.
At our
My inauguration as the president
of the Hickory Apache Nation.
I spoke for about 10 minutes in
the hickory.
Then I
Change it up to English.
First part I mentioned, you
know.
The audience was what I said in
Hickory.
The 10 minute version.
It's going to take me 30 minutes
to say it in English.
Because the language is direct,
it's to the point.
There's no gray areas of when
you speak your language, that
gives it the strength.
The meaning, the power.
And all those parts to our
culture and language.
Learning the songs without
understanding what you're
speaking on the strength of
those songs and ceremonies, it's
not going to be part of it.
It's just like reading some kind
of a textbook or listening to a
Song by maybe the eagles.
If you play an eagle song in
this venue.
Everybody will start singing
along.
That kind of setting is where we
need to be with our cultural
songs.
And someone within the group
would start.
A verse from everyone should.
Join in
I want it to be that way for
each and every tribe and nation.
And Pueblo
I'm bringing that down the road
to the point where
The constitutions that were
given us.
In the reorganization Act in
1934 mentions any Indian, but
through the years,
As as hickory have a blood
quantum in it now.
It's a way of weeding us out as
people.
I'm full blooded for for.
In 20 years' time, how many of
us are going to be left.
And how many of us
are going to be able to speak
the language.
Add another 20, that's going to
be 40. We'll probably be down to
the halves.
There's tribes in different
areas of this country.
That use lineage.
Maybe that's the way to go.
There's tribes in Oklahoma that
every 10 to 20 years, everyone
on the road is converted to full
blood.
There's ways that we can deal
with this.
Good afternoon and thank you on
behalf of the Hickory Aag Nation
for allowing me to address that.
2025 American Indian Day at the
legislator honoring tribal
self-determination.
I would like to recognize the
youth.
From a douchey schools. There's
a few, uh,
I
The staff of the Cultural
Resource department. I'm sure
there's somebody in the
audience.
Recognizing our elders.
And veterans
I myself am a left the United
States Marine Corps.
Reminds me of a story when I
came back from that.
The 4 year time that I spent
there.
4 years away is
When you look at it, it's, it's
a very short time.
But my mother thought.
Otherwise, she caught me into
the house.
I need to speak to you.
And you all know.
If your mother wants to see you.
Deep in the back of your mind,
you're thinking.
What's going on? What did I do?
Why does she need to see me?
So I
Slowly creeped up into the step
of the house and sat down at the
dining table.
Wondering what what's going to
be said.
She sat down and looked at me
and said,
I'm gonna ask you a question.
I said, OK.
And she says to me,
Hakushaina.
She said, what did I say?
I looked at her and said,
Whenever I think you're coming
over, put some coffee on.
She smiled.
Tell me you've been away for a
while?
You still understand. Now get
out of here. Behave.
tell my mother used to be.
She passed away a couple of
years back, but uh my mother was
real.
I would say opponent of culture
language.
That's how I grew up.
Hickory was my first language.
You hear this awful stories of
how
Young students were treated. I
went through that same type of
treatment.
Because I didn't understand
English.
And as a youngster, you don't
know why these things are
happening, but
It did happen.
But it makes you stronger.
Like Ne present mentioned
they're not going to get rid of
us. We're still here.
The hero's vision was
established in 1887.
February 11
That's next week.
We're having a lot of culture
events, Hickory week you guys
should come up.
It's soup stew fry bread.
Joy someone to know it's all
happening next week.
On August 4th, 1937, 1 year
after the Indian reorganization
at the
Try join that.
portion of that law.
In 1934 was when it was created,
but uh.
In 1937.
It's when that
Hickory is
Acted on it.
When I was teaching my class, I
had to also touch on history.
So some of our travel fields
have 1887, some have 1937.
I questioned him.
place that
Number of different year
difference on these different
travel. They look at me kind of
puzzled.
1934 they enacted in.
reorganization.
But it took a couple of years to
round us up.
We're all over the place.
You've been down to our brothers
down in Mescalero.
So by the time they got our
leadership together to go to
Washington to actually sign this
document, that's why that year
is 1937.
So when I explain this to our
youth in the classroom.
You can see the smile, the light
bulb going off and, yeah, OK, I
understand these things that
were happening through those
times.
Over the years we have faced
various challenges at the
federal and state levels.
We have worked through economic
hardships.
And are working to address the
issues of our education.
The health, the behavioral
health.
That affect our communities.
The hickorypaation along with
our brother and sister tribes
have fought to protect our
sovereignty, to protect our
lands, our cultural traditions
and language.
The Hickory nation and all
tribal communities have played
prominent roles in building the
foundation and framework of
state and travel relations.
Mm
Along with protecting
Tribal sovereignty as we move
together.
Hickory paved the way in social
welfare policy establishing
tribal framework and federal,
state, and local governments.
Hickory cleared a way to
establish the first major
cornerstone when it challenged
the state and its treatment of
children in
In need of
Temporary foster care as a
results in neglect and abuse of
other extenuating circumstances.
It established the government to
government foundation, the state
Supreme Court recognized the
tribal courts to be courts of
competent jurisdiction.
It recognized the right to
authorize.
Authorities of tribes to set up
their own standard consistent
with cultural values under the
US Supreme Court decision of
cotton petroleum of 1982, the
Hickory nation successfully
argued to build a share tax
policy framework while
predicting the sovereign powers
and authority of the nation.
In Marin versus Hickory Hickory
Nation challenged the state and
its authority to tax oil and gas
activity on top of the traveling
imposed tax.
As we, as we move forward in
these challenging times we have
to be.
Cognizant cognizant that there.
are always issues that we need
to fight as Indian people.
We are strong people. That's why
we as nations,
We have to stand together and
support one another.
We are Indian people.
We are one. We all believe in
preserving our traditions, our
culture, languages, ceremonies
for our people.
Today we must stand together to
dictate, dictate the future of
our communities and what we want
for the future of our children
and communities.
Thank you and we look forward to
continued dialogue with New
Mexico legislator, executive and
judicial branch to advance the
efforts of the Hickory Apache
Nation and all tribal
communities, we thank you for
the opportunity to share our
thoughts and views with you as
we embark on this important time
in New Mexico history.
There's a lot of other things
that we can touch on but uh.
I think as a, as a people, as a
state.
Working together
That's the only way we can get.
Moving forward.
In the right direction.
These words in our language that
say these things, and each time
I say a prayer, these words
always mentioned.
How the sun and the moon pass
over us.
That represents one of our
Ceremonies in September.
Jonale.
A hand.
As the sun and the moon travel
over us, the way they trade
places watching over us, the
Creator.
Cred such a beautiful thing to
help us through life.
There's the power of the prayer.
Thank you guys.
Thank you, Akiha Shana, uh, and

Recognizing you all from where
you all come from and what you

our spirits and what you believe
in your spirits.
Uh, be here with us with an open
mind and open heart. Thank you.
I'm James Mountain. I'm the
chairman of the All Pub Council
of Governors.
Our council dates back to
origins of 1598.
The first meeting convened by
our elders, my ancestors.
On behalf of the Pueblo
governors here in New Mexico,
the 19 pueblos.
It's an honor to be here today
to address this body.
And I appreciate this honor on
American Indian Day of the state
of New Mexico 2025.
Mr. Speaker
Honorable Mr. Speaker, honorable
Madam Protem.
Stuart
Speaker Martinez, Honorable
senators and representatives and
to my fellow tribal leaders.
All dignitaries present.
To our elders,
To our youth, our constituents,
all of our people. Thank you.
I ask him my thoughts as I tried
to compile.
What would I address today
before this body.
I realized that the last time I
had this great honor was 18
years ago.
And here I am once again. I
never thought I'd be standing
here before this body.
A lot has changed in 18 years.
I'm going to remind us all about
some of that change.
And I hope in my thoughts that I
want to share with you that I
ask that you share with me.
As well
Who we are today.
Where we have come from.
And who can we be moving
forward?
I want to start with the
recognition of sovereign status.
As we heard earlier,
This marks the 50 year
anniversary this year, 2025 of
the Indian Self-determination
Act of 1975.
Which provided for tribes.
In short definition.
The ability to contract with
federal government to run
programs and services for their
communities.
With goals of more autonomy and
control over our services.
Ensuring that tribes are
involved to meet these needs?
To honor past treaties and
commitments to native peoples,
in short.
And what this law and act did 50
years ago.
It added to a concept of tribal
sovereignty.
Which predates this law.
For centuries.
This concept that we talk about
as tribal leaders.
That we share with you all as
nation to nation.
Is a concept of inherent
authority.
Of tribes to govern themselves
within the borders of the United
States.
It is a unique relationship that
we as tribal
Nations have with the federal
government.
Yet we as pueblos have been
governing ourselves long before
this concept of tribal
sovereignty.
As it was contextualized in a
dictionary and in Google.
To help me write this speech.
The pueblos have been recognized
through multiple governments
throughout history.
Starting with the crown of Spain
with first contact in 1540.
As you fast forward and I
mentioned this convening of the
meeting with the crown of Spain
in 1598 and sent to Domingo
Pueblo by our elders at that
time.
Where in our record.
Recollection.
A can of authority, as symbolism
of sovereignty of government to
government dialogue.
Was bestowed upon the pueblos
and at that time there were more
than what we have today.
More than double what we have
today.
Today we, we, we stay strong as
19 pueblos.
You fast forward to
The Mexican period, the Mexican
government government of 1821.
Once again recognizing the
uniqueness of pueblos and our
sovereign authority and our
ability to communicate on those
premises.
with the Treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo in 1848.
We see now the United States
government.
That we all enjoy.
That we all have complexities
with.
That we all have
Unique relationship with as
sovereigns, the state is a
sovereign nation, tribes of
sovereign nations.
And in 1863 that reaffirmation
with another cane was granted to
the 19 pueblos by President
Abraham Lincoln.
If you look in our, on our canes
and the crown of that, that
silver crown. It says A Lincoln.
1863, Pablo de San Alfonso,
Pablo of Santana, Pablo of
Cociti, and so on. And I want to
recognize.
In this
I thought that I'm asking you to
share with me today.
This great state of New Mexico.
In the last several years I've
found such a pride in in being
in this capacity and, and, and a
reinvigoration of what it is to
be a New Mexican.
What it is to be a senolifonso.
My homeland
As a former governor, now as the
chairman of all public council
of Governors.
Because this great state.
took it upon themselves and the
leadership of this state in 1981
to issue a cane of authority.
By the great honorable Governor
Bruce King.
That's 4 cans of authority that
have recognized this pueblos.
As as Pueblos and our sovereign
authority and our ability.
To have government to government
dialogue.
To be self-sufficient and to
continue to build and to be a, a
productive
Group
That contributes to this great
state.
And if you think about the time
frame going back to 1981 and
what, where we are today.
It leads us to a, a legacy of
leadership and shared
responsibility in this
leadership.
We all carry this responsibility
that our predecessors and
ancestors held with honor and
respect.
And I'd like to recognize and
remind us all about these
visionary leaders that built
this framework.
That you
That I want to recognize as well
now have inherited along with
myself, my fellow governors, and
tribal leaders.
And we carry this forward.
People like the great
Former Speaker Mr. Ben Luhan.
Speaker Raymond Sanchez.
Nick Salazar.
Governor Bill Richardson,
Governor Gary Johnson, Governor
Gary Carruthers.
And I'm talking about not only
how they contributed and built
to New Mexico, but the
relationships that they had
specifically with us as tribe.
The great senator John Pinto.
The great representative Roger
Magdalena.
Our governor Michelle Lujan
Grisham.
All champions for tribal rights,
tribal recognition.
This concept of sovereignty,
honoring government to
government dialogue.
Just like you all do on a daily
basis and I thank you.
Tribal leaders like the great
Mescalero president Wen Del
Chino.
Who added to the construction
and building of this framework.
Navajo Nation President Peter
Petersona.
Former chairman of the All
Indian Publo Council Delphine
Lovato.
Governor Roland Johnson Laguna
Pueblo, Governor Walter Dashno,
Santa Clara Pello, Governor
Regis Peco's Cochiti Pueblo.
Governor Jake Villarreal, Paaque
Pueblo, to name a few, there are
so many.
And I was just a little, a
little snot-nosed kid running
around at that time. But I do
remember meeting them and that
and then and that honor because
my father was a governor, and I
had that privilege to be able to
be mentored, taught things, I
should have paid more attention.
I think that's something I think
might resonate with all of us
because there's not a doubt in
my mind that every single person
in this room.
With your courage, thank you for
your courage, took it upon
yourself to stand in these
positions with that number one
thing in, in your heart is to
help.
To help our people to serve our
people.
We come from a legacy of
leadership that was committed
and prudent to the pursuit of
building New Mexico, thus
allowing us.
To now inherit this
responsibility with a strong
ability to elevate this great
state of New Mexico to the next
level and beyond.
Our current state and the
progress that has been made, and
I ask you to bear with me on
this, and I ask for your action.
Collectively
Because it's now in your hands,
legislators.
Senators
Representatives.
Because now maybe there's never
been a time more ripe.
Of an opportunity for New
Mexico.
We've realized key achievements
and investments in this
framework that has been built,
the Indian Education Act of
2003.
We've seen what it's yielded and
how it's produced the Yazy
Martinez ruling.
An important piece of
legislation. It's not just about
Indian education, it's about New
Mexico children and students.
It's not just about Indian
education, it's about our school
system that needs to be improved
and we have to figure out a way
to come together.
Put aside the differences and
continue to build on that.
It stalled a little bit, but we
got to figure it out that
pathway forward collectively.
The all Indian public the all
Pueblo council governors is in.
We're committed
Senate Bill 13, state tribal
Education compact Schools Act.
Thank you, Senator Shchino.
I asked this, this, this
leadership.
To please take the
Action to move that forward.
It's built on that what we've
talked about language and
culture and the preservation of
that. It's another stepping
stone. It's not the end all or
the solve all. It's another
piece of that stepping stone
that we move forward that we
built now of what we've
inherited.
The Indian education fund
increase to 50 million.
I asked this legislative body.
On behalf of the Al Pablo
Council of Governors to fund it
at that level, we find a way.
Please, favorable action.
Thank you Governor Lu Hong
Grisham for pushing that. Thank
you, tribal leaders for working
with her and finding that common
ground because we didn't all get
what we wanted individually, but
we figured out something.
Just like you all do on a daily
basis.
And thank you for your
leadership and helping us
getting there. I want to
recognize New Mexico Indian
Affairs Department, my
colleague, Senator, um,
Secretary Joseph Monette, thank
you for standing up and being
the leader of our great
Indian Affairs department.
I am told that there are 2
states in the United States that
have a cabinet level position.
I've never been able to figure
out the second. So we'll just
stick with the best state, which
is ours.
Because in truth,
Again, what I'm asking you to
consider with me in these
thoughts is that we lead this
country in tribal sovereignty,
that concept, and upholding
self-determination.
And it shows in this cabinet
level position.
And I ask
This body
With Senate Bill 163, the tribal
regalia at school events Act.
To please take favorable action
in moving that forward and
getting it upstairs.
Thank you, Senator Shindo,
Representative Johnson.
In addition to that, I'm told
that there will be, and I'm not
sure of the, the, the number or
the name of the, the bill, but
there will be legislation
enhancing our ability to
communicate and what's what
Secretary Monet has led with the
um
Turquoise alert, in addition to
alert, specific to, um, our
native communities.
I think that will help bridge
the gap that we find throughout
our police departments that
disconnect that's there.
And so when that if and when
that act that does get dropped.
And I hope it does, Senator
Charlie, Represent a Beta, thank
you. It's right there.
We ask that you take favorable
action to get that upstairs.
Honorable legislators.
With regards to water.
Do I really need to go into the
discussion about how dear that
is and precious to us all.
I know from a pueblo perspective
that it's part of our spirit.
Literally part of a spirit in
how we live and interact on a
day to day basis.
I share that with you. I know
what it means to you all, and I
know how important it is, at
least.
And with Bill 137, the strategic
Water Supply Act. It's another
stepping stone in that right
direction that's inclusive, and
we've got to figure out a way
and preser preserving this.
Thank you, Senator Munoz,
Representative Herrera.
Legislators, I ask you all to
take favorable action on that
one as well.
Please preserve our state tribal
tax agreements.
Thank you for the Indian Child
Welfare work that you all have
done.
Continue to work and preserve
those gaming compacts.
Again, remember where those come
from, the people that I've
mentioned that we now stand in
there in those places.
Infrastructure investments,
tribal infrastructure fund of
2005, we're at 80 million
approximately this year.
Because of the, the foresight
and the leadership that we had
in our predecessors to get us
here.
I will tell you, legislators,
lawmakers respectfully.
It's a lot of money, but it's
not enough.
But please bear with us and
tribal leaders, we must take the
responsibility.
To get our houses in order to
get our money encumbered to get
it spent in these projects
built.
And we are doing that, Mr.
Speaker.
Madam
President Pro Tem.
Honorable leisure, we are doing
that. Secretary Monet is moving
that dial under her leadership.
We are all getting that in the
right direction, have confidence
in us that we continue to do so.
And please
Reconsider another tribal
package.
It's working.
Investing in New Mexico tribes.
Equals a stronger New Mexico.
Looking forward, continued
collaboration.
And building upon this 40 years
of framework.
Again recognizing and reflect on
the importance of government to
government relationships.
Our partnership nations to
nations.
In closing, building the
building upon New Mexico's
strengths, our strengths.
I'd like to applaud you all.
And our people of New Mexico,
this great state.
Everybody
We have the highest per capita
Native American legislative
representation. Thank you for
having that courage.
This significant rise in Native
American elected offices across
the board.
is noted with the increase of
native women legislators of such
a significant importance.
And continued guidance and
leadership. Thank you for your
courage.
Continue to value cooperation,
collaboration.
Our commitment to finding common
ground.
Building a stronger New Mexico
together, stronger tribal
communities again equal the
stronger New Mexico.
It is our responsibility for our
future generations for those yet
to come.
Mr. Speaker, Madam Protem.
Honorable legislators.
I did not forget you, Lieutenant
Governor.
Lieutenant Governor Morales.
Uh, Honorable Governor Lujan
Grisham.
To all the leadership in here,
my fellow tribal leaders.
I appreciate that we can stand
shoulder to shoulder and figure
this out. I thank you for this
honorable opportunity to come

we go moving forward has
resonated and I ask you to
