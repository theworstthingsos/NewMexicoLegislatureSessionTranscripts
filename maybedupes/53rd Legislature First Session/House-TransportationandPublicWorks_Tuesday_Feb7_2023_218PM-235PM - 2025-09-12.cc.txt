two eight.
Amendment yes there is an
amendment.

of preference.

Okay.
It's a he you have an expert in
the house.
Thank.
With you.
All right so.
Madam chair committee members
We're on the amendment all talk
about the bill here momentarily
but the amendment is technical
fix you'll notice the two line
items are just making sure that
we are.
verifying location is real
right.
In the state to make sure that
this tax.
Credit yes Representative four
in the state announcements.
Have you answering questions
for.
This amendment affirmation.
Correct.
So chair members of the
committee House Bill to what
locate is tax credit bill.
Actually ex.
What this does is for class two
or class three railroads the
state the the smaller.
Provides a credit.
This is twelve to be applied to
personal income tax for
corporate tax return your focus
is because depending on how the
business is structured the money
paid corporation tax personal
taxes where those are in but
it's a credit for income tax.
Fifty percent of eligible.
Road school for expenditures.
And there are some limits you
can only do up to five thousand
dollars per mile.
Track board and.
And it is also capped at five
million dollars per year.
So
But that is really kind of the
essence of the bill the idea
behind it.
Is that we have a lot of track
in the state that needs access.
And.
By giving someone sent us.
we might see that.
That track maintain our.
You'll to the price.
Your.
Sorry that only a.
My daughter lost her phone
they're trying to get me to help
our.
Don't return phone often turned
back on the chair it is one
point this only committees of
where the
money all right yes
Representative is.
We have resulted in perfect and
then I explained to them.
The structure of the credits the
half of five thousand per mile
that person.
For for.
That's the case and that we've
got a lot of those trapped in
the state that.
this might Senator.
So that's what okay.
With that go ahead.
This is going over all.
Mostly though thank you Mr C.
expert witness is here hello but
and to us on two five to sit
ability officer division here.
If you're experts want to
anything are they just your
question.
Chair of the question if you
recall comments.
Yeah
venters the face tracking very
high work but said the company
are for Health shortline
railroads across the country
finance their infrastructure
through
it's prudent work
I would just brief summary of
this bill is about accelerating
track reinvested boosting
economic development
opportunities for the state
We nine states currently passes
program and
it's just a really good
mechanism to you know it's not a
hand out the roads that spend
money for so.
That always get questions.
I went to the audience to have
anybody who supports.
M. sectors chair members of the
committee rather.
On the FTEs of road user all the
sure lands that we work with
used in support of the.
In the US.
Manager is asked to do this.
I was asked to testify about of
report back around one of the
survivors in the southwest part
of the state services the copper
industry factor Representative
Jones goes through a good
portion of her district as well.
Senator.
Representative ****
but that's the main cause of
Silvercity that'd to Deming and
up to rent controversy and
connects the class one rover
road which is one of our clients
Senator.
And U. P. the copper goes up and
down so that's one of the short
lines in Mexico the motion line
in the southeast part of the
state
and then there's another one
it's actually SantaFe.
We have a co sponsor that sign
and sign on to that also we will
see and associate three
shorelines and that's what
wraparound is also supporting
the asking if I would conceive
that thank you so much.
Good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee needs
to see Currier and represent the
economic development corporation
of the county as well as any
County and is that that portion
of the area state looks to
diversify its economic bases
these types of opportunities
that allow them to bring
additional industries in and we
appreciate your consideration
support thank you thank you when
asked.
In online.
Anybody in opposition to this
stuff.
Okay go to the committee do we
have any members of questions
Representative.
Thank you madam chair
Representative losses thank you
so but a lot of monopoly when I
was growing up
I always get the real roads.
You know reading short.
But I didn't know until just
recently would assure plan
Rosie is so my initial thought
was maybe it's the distance of
the track the length of it but
according to this analysis madam
chair class to short line has
revenue of two nine hundred and
forty three million dollars
million dollars and that class
three up to forty two point four
million in revenue.
So I appreciated that definition
in the analysis that we were
given that's good information to
have a manager basically
Representative I support the
bill I think it's going to
really help with economic
development all over the state.
And for all about this committee
transportation and public works
and this is just one of those
things that I think really does
needed infusion of investment
and so I appreciate the bill and
I will be voting for it thank
you Representative
Representative Harper.
Thank you madam chair
Representative Jones just just
maybe a couple quick comments I
just had to.
I assume because you had to tax
next.
so
remind me of Madam chair
representative is just have a
reporting requirement and
sunset.
In order to for that.
So data as as reported by TRD is
a ten year sunset.
Yes we were the ten years since
I can remember the report
requirements and so that those
are kind of first two things you
look at when it comes to taxes
that's that's good that's in
there the other saying just to
consider right so these goals
come for taxpayer temporarily
tabled.
and then we kind of gather
everything in the committee and
then you know towards the end we
we kind of right thing based off
of how much capacity we have the
budget we left things out.
So.
So maybe something to consider
As you go forward is it looks
like you've got a six million
dollar cap on the pest side and
on the Senate side.
And.
Guessing I don't know how UNICEF
for these other
that you know fifties my
participate either structuresï¿½
or corporate or or hello Cesar
passed to introduce our
partnerships or whatever
but just looking at that number
right your your FIR says up to
twelve million and so what we're
looking at the list we're gonna
look at twelve.
Hi so you guys might want to
think about that if you have an
amendment that might bring that
number lower you know depending
on you know whatever you guys
decide that increases your
likelihood back yeah.
The.
After the chair representative
that's good that's great point
we talk about an amendment it's
it's an either or it's at the
cap on the bill six million for
both C. I. T. N. P. I. T.
combined so that's about three
point we've been discussing.
Okay.
Cool thank you I think that's a.
My my counsel for thank you very
much thank you madam chair thank
you Representative Lundstrom
but.
In seconds.
is there any opposition.
And I believe you have
yourselves of the past thank you
madam.
