over some of the legislative
funding we've had over the

This legislative finding funding
is very important to the
district without it we wouldn't

And the same thing i'm in
montoya we have a five mile

next month.
Those are upcoming we got about
thirteen million dollars.
Then we have some ongoing
projects related to the fire as
you all know we had the hermit
speaker cafcanian fire it's been
already about two years but we
still have a lot of work we've
done a lot of work and we're
still finishing up like a and a
we finished the garage
replacement there was a lot of
gardener that burned over a
million dollars and we completed
that
we are still replacing fence we
had.
Over a million dollars of
fencing needs right now the
contractor is unsuspension but
he's done a lot of work and he
will continue once we get the
weather.
And then we got some other hot
and place recycled projects that
were gonna be are doing.
And some of the roads in that
area these are secondary roads
and what happened is the heavy
heavy equipment in these fire
all the spirit equipment came in
these are just chips of road and
they messed up our roads pretty
bad so.
We're able to get some other
funding thanks to rick to take
every.
Okay page seven we have our stip
program for district for.
These are projects upcoming.
In twenty two fiscal and twenty
twenty four we got forty two
million twenty five we got
thirty three million
to twenty seven we have fifty
four million and twenty eight we
have thirty million.
These projects are spread spread
out we have a.
Almost every year we have one
and I forty we've been focusing
on I forty a we're starting to
focus on I for because it really
it really needs it out there so.
Page eight
these are future unfunded
projects
that we're working on.
The sixty four I twenty five in
a chance in raton clinton we
have issues there with a traffic
backing up on.
Really old in a.
We have to go down you see it
some more I forty projects.
So my twenty five projects some
business loops and last biggest
in springer
and.
We have a study
the last one to study for us
fifty four to can carry the
texas day line we've seen an
increase in traffic contract.
Also we have some upcoming
studies grand avenue and las
vegas the next face and maximum
avenue and springer.
Trying to protect funds for for
twenty twenty on page nine
these are.
These are funds we provided
ninety five percent state
funding and the entities match
with five percent.
There we spread him out
throughout the district from las
vegas center over to concarry
and to the different counties as
you see there we had a total of
close to ten million dollars for
nine projects for nine entities.
For twenty twenty two same thing
they're spread out we had about
close to thirty million dollars
for twenty twenty two.
And these are a.
All that the different counties
and different entities
throughout district for.
The.
Looks like we had twenty
projects for fifteen different
entity so it's been spread out
throughout the district.
Page ten
pier for twenty twenty three
same thing it looks like we have
seventeen million for this year.
The.
Again fifteen entities got that
some projects fifteen different
projects you see there a lot of
them are like a million dollar
projects the biggest ones
two point five for the city last
biggest and.
There's different amounts there
but we try to spread it o.
Okay next page eleven this is
our local government fund.
For twenty twenty four.
We have the county coops the
municipal coops in the school
district co ups again which
trying to spread out throughout
the district.
We have the county arterial
program the school bush route
municipal art arterial program.
In other cops so it looks like
we're a million four million
approximately four million
dollars that we spread out.
To the different school
districts and counties.
The right distrib.
Next we have a a district for
equipment needs for twenty
twenty four.
About twenty million dollars
worth a need.
Fifty million if we need it to
our equipment district for we
get a lot of snow.
So we have those trucks are
running during the storms all
the time of course we they get
all to be put a lot of minutes
on him they they break down we
do need to replace equipment a
lot specially dump trucks and in
the summertime mowers the more
is always going.
So we do the best we can to
maintain them and to make them
last as long as we can but
equipment is have to.
We're showing some of the needs
the big thing is like the ten
dump trucks.
That we need a sixteen mowers
regular pickup trucks three
quarter time for by four were
showing ten.
The.
So that's our our breakdown for
the equipment and the bottom we
have our snow removal for fiscal
year twenty two twenty three and
twenty four
the last two years we're over
four million dollars
this year we're already at three
point two nine including the
last time that we had this last
weekend so i'm sure we'll be.
Will be much above that four
million by then the winner i'm
sure it will be over five
million we'd have a we've had a
more snow this year than we've
had in the past so we're using a
lot more material.
A lot would be a lot more over
time.
With that that's peaced by this
the end of my presentation I I
stand for any questions.
Merrill really quickly we're
going to take role.

Representative romero
mister vice chair madam chair we
have a corner
of
any members.
I believe we don't have any tpf.
Madam chair and representative I
think we actually we did have
some tpf I just think we're
we're filled assured on this
spreadsheet here but we did have
somebody okay
amount of chair and mister
mister but yeah I think it's
impressive.
Thank you very much.
On your.
My crack.
And of the channel okay can you
tell can you tell the committee
why it's unwinner suspension
it's a high us no area and.
Are there any other pro.
The.
I twenty five minutes also.
See all the projects and I list
our.
Mister.
That you're just test on that
what is th.
The price is.
Yeah so madam chair
representative or victor excuse
me so once we better project in
those projectless prices are
locked into the contract once we
come out of winter suspension
that contract will still remain
holding the prices that are
contained with in
was so be will also be hold.
Thank.
What is that fair to the
contractor if you stall
multiple.
If you've been a million
dollars.
Madame chair vice chair.
You have to put a little bit
perspective so when we come out
of winter suspension if there's
a material that has gone up
between october and march we
have escalation clauses built
into contract so that we we can
negotiate that that price of
that does happen it it does
happen or it happened in fuel it
sometimes happened and still but
you got to remember that on a
two year construction project a
lot of that material is ordered
up front stock while that the
yard so that material has
already been either purchased
and stock pillars awaiting
delivery so a lot of that stuff
that still
lighting fixtures on those types
of of commodities that kind of
tender go with the market have
already been purchased and
hopefully stockpile at the yard
by that time.
Thank you manager.
More with this money because.
Your swaster and also the the
contractor does bid the project
knowing that they're going to
suspend for the winner and
they're the ones that request a
suspension from us.
Thank you very much gentlemen we
appreciate all that you've done
for us during this session and
we really enjoyed all of the
reporting and
close and said the relationship
we've had with the agency so
that it allows us to do our jobs
to the best for.
Absolutely thank you matter
chair members committee could
send you thank you
next week are going to senate
bill to a one senator of the.
The.
Thank you madame chair
when we are reorganized the p r
c with constru.
Established p r c is a
utility regulatory agency.
Activities under proceed that we
sought to remove and move under
different areas over time we've
done this for the very variety.
Peace that we wanted to do was
the transportation functions
with.
This is a lengthy bill but it's
it's just mostly cleaning up a
technology terminology that
doesn't match between the two
agencies so it's too basically
just get everything.
Official.
Regulations can.
Legal staff from both.
And it was a hundred.
It's technical stuff the one
substantive change.
But under what it.
Fun fact I went to element.
The.
Yes i'm old
sorry I had to.
Here in the audience who's in
favor of senate build.
Research secretary view tea this
is an agency all I want to think
the proceed we've been working
pretty comprehensively since
july well since march last year
really to get this hammered out
the secretary clean up the
transition move along a lot more
smoothly
and
and certainly a lot of things
senator to build because he's
stuck with this project human
senator worth since very
beginning going back to one
sixty
may here in a moment with from
being a safe we've been working
with them
and some language clean up but
really what we've done is kind
of really you know we bill and
replace prc with nmbt
and one of the words that maybe
because he names the courses
regularly there's federal law
that allows for sta.
Impose more stringent laws and
regulations than what they're
really does and so are doing the
regularly provides legislature
with the opportunity to I become
more stringent with our
oversight for real way.
Anybody else
anybody in opposition to senate
bill to one.
Members.
Uh.
On and announces the bill it
says the border.
My republican language.
Well we don't don't we don't
want them to have the power of
police off.
They don't enforce the.
It just seemed inappropriate
they think they don't carry
weapons they don't stop.
Talk to talk about him.
Thank you for the manager and
presenter what happened is a
board of entry if somebody.
I've been end of doing all my
life and you know the point
support.
How can decide.
It's not a criminal.
You know in other words people
you in for defective good m.
Yeah.
Since she said.
Madam chair mister vice chair
thank you for the question.
It actually is going to work out
better for this gr.
The issues because we will be
coordinating.
Right now it's called
transportation division the role
of the transportation division
is administrative when there's a
need for criminal interventions
or criminal citations they are
constantly cooperating with the
police and the please.
To address any of those.
You know i've been sighted.
And there is.
It is concerned
who has the power.
Yeah.
You know just by taking it away.
Next week.
The.
Great question because that was
really in in my discussions with
rail was what I asked our
general council staff one
example is our ability to
regulate the the safety of
crossings of real crossings and
that in locurately exist as a
regulatory requirement for the
overseeing agency and that will
be dealt
the other was
if this body wants to
adopt a law and provide in him
duty with regulatory oversight
federal law now allows for that
as long as that long is more
stringent than what the federal
law provides for and so the word
regulate provides the
legislature with an opportunity
to say this is an issue the new
law would be more stringent than
the federal law and duty would
then be tasked with regulating
compliance with.
Sure.
Sure a memorial turnover to
missed every cash he actually
has the the statute.
Madam chair representative lens
if I could back the little bit
the federal lies to refer to as
a safety act in the safety act
has a provision for pre emption
of state law to the extent that
the
safety act actually provides for
whatever the issue is if the
issue was not handled in the
safety act then the state can
step in and regulate right now
we do have cases going through
across the country regarding the
safety of these trains in
particularly across because the
trains have been getting longer
and longer than stop over across
in kids will need to be going to
school sometimes they're
crawling under the trains
because they're stopped there
and it creates serious safety
issues so this is actually in
national concern but what we're
dealing with in terms of this
bill is whether or not the state
will maintain its ability to
regularly in those situations
that are not covered by the sea.
I guess I don't understand how
you.
The.
That actually that's not correct
there was a misstatement so it
it's not that it needs to be
stricter for them federal law it
needs to be at least aligned
with the federal lie if there is
a federal law we differ to the
federal law if there is an
absence of federal law we can
step in and create a regulation
a lot of times when stay to
doing that now these end up in
these issues end up in courts.
Yeah.
So madam chair representative
the way that it works right now
is primarily that the staff is
working pursuing to a federal
contract so we have a federal
contract and we're helping to
enforce the federal regulations
to the extent that we have state
regulations those would be
promotated into rules and the
rules then we're you know the
the real roads would have an
opportunity to comment and and
to protest any of the rules that
we would propose right now we do
not have regulations regarding
the speed the length of the the
number of people that are
overseen the train so right now
those issues are are not present
in this bill what this bill is
during this merely cleaning up
the regulatory authority of the
state to say that we are not
regularly lady in the rate so we
just did some clean up were not
taking away the sticked
authority to regulate going f.
The.
Yes yes.
I madam chair and representative
one stream I I don't think
you're taking it to literally I
think it's important to look at
it with regard to the language
that is currently present in the
bill so we had sent a bill more
than sixty go through and in
that bill it said that we were
still regulating the rates and
we are regulating the sleeping
car so this is taken away that
specificity and leaving the
general ability to regulate and
then to the extent that we
regularly it would be in rules
that would be.
Madame chair representative
loans I suspect that if we were
to do that we would be in court.
Could we could we do that.
Matter of share representative
long strong
I mean certainly we could
propose rules of that nature
under this
writing in the statute I I do
not see that we would be doing
that I think those kind of
issues rise to the level of
federal authority and that the
federal government really needs
to look at the.
Yeah.
In terms of the regulations we
are proposing new regulations
involving the real railroads but
they're not and they do not
provide for additional powers
that is going to go through the
usual process of getting a
regulations inacted so there is
no present intent to regulate
any further than the p r c was
regulating
and in regards to being ready on
on july first we have the two
staffs have been working
together since last marched to
of a range of that and I think
we will be ready to hit the
ground and we as as some of the
members here know more
additional funding greater
funding that than the p r c had
is going to be available for for
this effort and that will allow
more inspectors to be hired and
will provide for additional
public safety so
there's nothing particularly
ominous about about this or any
particular reason to think that
the dot.
And want to do regulations with
the real road industry that is
unusual or out of the out of the
ordinary or not done by.
The.
Four years
later.
Reps we pass originally.
So they've been working on all
of the.
The senator.
So back to the question of
inspectors are looking for
safety violations are those
inspectors wearing a unif.
The.
Speaking civically of the
inspectors of the real roads
well we could we could look at
that or any other inspector.
So the inspectors for the motor
carrier act or generally not
wearing uniforms they do carry
and identification badge and the
inspectors for the railroads are
generally not wearing a uniform
per se but they will have hard
hats and they will have
reflective vess.
Yeah.
A madam chair representative
brown I believe we do not have
any.
And and that is something that
has risen.
We have an area that.
Um
madam chair and and senator so.
I I like this bill I think.
The chuckle when I read that
under the current law.
Ambulance services have to be
determined to serve a useful
public p.
Yeah.
Is exactly what they do but
that's going to go out of the.
That he wanted.
The.
But we know a lot of that is
federal regulation.
But the way the bill was r.
In terms of regulation.
Yes representative brown and
madam chair
the the the lord this this this
bill does not change the law in
the sense that the word
regulate.
And the only regulations that
are allowed would be regulations
allowed specifically by the
steps by the statute or by rules
and acted to enforce to enforce
enforces statute so this does
not increase any power of
regulation that the firm
transportation would have that
would be different and what the
public regulation commission has
been enforcing and passed
regulate appears in the
existing.
Thank you senator bill.
I too have concerns about this
language and I have a couple of
questions I don't know if we'll
be able to get the information
i'm hoping to get but I think it
would be helpful for the
committee to want go through the
old lane good language as it is
now and perhaps talk about maybe
any historical context and as to
why that language is the way it
is and then talk about what this
new language is reporting to do
because the way I read it I mean
I I find it problematic as well
so i'm going to read it out
very.
I'm going to try to literate
commas which I law school they
teach your extremely important
everything can change on a comma
so
currently the way the largest
drafted it says the department
shall fix comma determine comma
supervised comma regulate and
control are all charges and
rates a real rate express comma
telegraph comma telephone comma
sleeping car and other comma
transportation companies and
common carrier.
The way I read that
senator novel mister hamilton is
the department may fix
determined suprise regulation
control all charges and rates
are real rents rest eleven to
telegraph telephone sleeping car
because of where the common
placement is you don't you don't
have a comma you have come as
between fixed determined
supervised and then you have the
phrase the dependent
cars regulate in control all
charges and rates of railway
express comma.
So to me that sounds like a much
narrow narrower in scope
power to regulate the simply
just do it simply replacing it
with.
Partner shall regulate real way
companies
I understand what you're saying
senator nevel and and mister
hamilton and I understand that
what rules will and can be
promotated to
clarify what that power to
regulate looks like then we need
to make sure that we draft the
statute in such a way so still
allow that flexibility but
I think that we I think that we
are
really changing what this
running
with this new language
I loved.
But by taking out the power of
controlling all charges and
rates which was in the old
statute and
taking out their power to
regulate express sleeping car
and other companies we are
limiting this bill limits the
power of the going forward the
DO t to regulate
regulate real way companies and
what can be done in terms of
regulation is then spelled out
further and further in the bill
the builders know it simply mean
you can do anything you want uh
there's some major limitations
to add including primarily
including primary federal
regulations because they they
supersede state regulations as
this is a highly regulated
regular enterprise by the
federal government so I would
respectfully disagree with.
Chair on that.
The
bill only gives the power to do.
Spells out to some extent but
the power regulate means.
Clarified further by regula.
Um I don't know if perhaps
council b r c has.
A matter of chairs.
Ah certainly we're not going to
overstep into the federal
preemption area and the concern
for this state is primarily
safety so what this allows it to
do is regulate any safety issues
that are not currently addressed
by the.
Experts and and senator never
also I just want to make sure
i'm understanding that.
Currently we're taking the
regulatory scope of the agency.
All these other types of.
We are taking out a way we are
focusing solely on railways and
deal to ability to regulate
railways in my understanding
that.
That yes madam sure that's
exactly what I how over.
The truth was AP r c was not
actively regula.
It was not appropriate if they
have this in here anymore than
it was necessary to have a
language in the bill about
regulation regulating the
transportation of cadavers which
was something that there's no
power there's no power in the
existing lot allowed that we
have nothing to do with a
funeral homes and herself
so that that was the purpose of
making th.
Well here is the underneath it
depends it's it's it's defines
what some of the some of the
regulations are required rare
road companies to provide and
maintain adequate equipment
people stock and station
buildings agents of the
somebody.
A requirement companies to
provide such reasonable safety
appliances and the assessor
reasonable safety practices
maybe.
The.
I was a carry out all other and
have other powers provided by
law.
There that later on it are
private provides for an appeal
from the final decision.
And in this this the next
section that's the that's the
summon substance of the pop
regular three pounds
okay think you send it in the
bill and mister hamilton now
that I read the section and it's
completion so you are the new
languages the department
transportation shall regulate
railway transportation companies
more vehicle carriers with the
state and then points two three
four five literate exactly what
that regulation means in terms
of what the trans- the division.
That's necessitating the catch
all of points seven carry out
all other duties and have other
powers provided by loss of I
understand now
what you were trying to do with
the l.
Thank you.
It's the pleasure of the
commission.
Representative brown.
Representative.
Representative harper.
Representative later.
No.
Representative.
Manager.
Thai vote senator novel i'm
sorry.
Yeah on a type of I processes.
I concludes our business I just
want to take a moment to think
all of our enlistened staff the
list here beginning with mr
george dodge that hull george
has been amazing to this
committee all year really helped
a lot of the work we've done
leon shen weighing often.
Scott berhines.
And david stoller
and on this side we have key
hailer
