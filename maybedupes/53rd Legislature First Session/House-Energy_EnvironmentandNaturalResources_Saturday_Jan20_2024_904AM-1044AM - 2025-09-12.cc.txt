Studying and here.
So this is our first meeting we
didn't have a.
This committee.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
That you should have shorter
didn't.
We still have too big bills.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Other.
Got a lot.
The.
So.
Yeah.
Thank you very much mister
chair.
I will be.
So.
And if you're not
the mo.
The.
If it weren't getting.
Yeah.
The.
No.
Would you like me to tell.
This.
Mister share i've been s.
Oh.
Used to be the.
I do
I do think there was some
confus.
The.
Yeah.
Okay so when we would get to
public.
Does that sound okay not too.
Members of the committee.
Members of the audience and the
five or six people who.
Thank you so much for allowing
me.
That is going to happen later.
Fuel standards.
Won't be left out in the most
sick when the most significant
global opportunity economic
cover.
Already nearly four hundred
million billion dollars in
private.
We need to bring some of that
money right here to new mexico
this bill opens the door for
sixteen hundred plus
really good paying permanent
jobs.
And four hundred and seventy
million dollars of wage income
that comes with them.
Two hundred forty million
dollars of new investment in new
mexico's quick start low carbon
field projects.
Oregon already has a clean fuel
standard and they saw three
hundred million dollars.
Without this bill.
The new energy that we're
experiencing all around the
country will leave new mexico
behind and this is a huge part
of the reason why i'm carrying
this bill the economic the
economic reasons but I think
more personally in for.
Because of where I grew up in
and my family who still lives in
the largest non attainment zone
in the united states and the
central valley california.
This bill is going to make a
huge difference.
The.
I was surprised to learn that
one and seven new mexicans
suffered from respiratory
illness.
And we spend a lot of money in
the state
insuring their health
so this bill will do so much to.
Transportation industry.
I want to talk a little bit
about oil and gas I know that
some of my colleagues i'm
looking at right now and it's
not too late to sign on our
concerns that have that this
program will.
Economy but that is not the case
it allows only one gas industry
to ben it from the investments
that they're already making to
lower carbon emissions folks in
new mexico want to do this the
big companies are already doing
this are already making those
clean energy investments they
are making clean fuels but those
fuels are by passing new mexico
they're going to.
I want to make sure that we.
Keep those queen fuels here in
the state and they were
producing them here in the only
way.
From the clean fuels like
something like twenty five
billion.
They're not seeing those
dollars.
We're making major investments
in all kinds of things that make
this state better you education
broadband roads job training
let's let's do it with clean
fields as well.
This this bill does will not
make you drive an electric car
though I would I would love to
have one it is about choice in
options there is a cleaner fuel
for you renewal diesel
compressed natural gas ethernet
and gasoline and of course
electric vehicles.
Introduce my.
Who's the environmental prote.
How the clean standard will work
a little more deeply.
Yeah.
This budget we again have record
revenues thanks to our faster.
And our continued prominence as
a.
The clean fuel investments being
made from that.
Supplemental investments that
really expand the option.
Associated health costs.
New mexic.
The global energy industry clean
fuels.
While still supporting those
investment.
All the investment from the
clean energy boom while we do
nothing this is a supplement to
our current energy.
I want you to take away three
things one the economic impact
and how the market works how
updates to our legislation can
reach both rural.
That new mexicans.
The clean fuel credit market.
Standard established after each
forty one has passed.
The way it works is those who.
Purchase credits from the clean
fuel market.
That's the market mechanism
peace.
Those credits will be sold by
entities generating.
So the clean.
With those transactions.
Between the entity.
Market well run it s.
Harbon emissions.
Entities that can.
Renew.
Here at about one is real valley
by fuels which presented during.
Will help them to expand their
market and.
Has also.
They have electrifi.
And they can't do it without
additional clean fuels that will
allow.
A lot but hey if there is a way
to make money from it people
will find a wa.
This this program has allowed
the d.
White a few.
Never before thought of.
Entervising clean energy.
To all of these innovations and
the clean energy boom just like
other states are doing right
now.
Representatives who know here
districts and constituents best.
Information packets we handed
out.
Of uh
consumer cost we have a periodic
review that we've added.
All diff.
Our communities fear and help
our economy.
I'd also like to talk.
Despite our clean blue skies
here in new m.
From this kind of.
Ranked.
That are communities are
absorbing every day.
I'd also like to talk about.
That we have learned is that gas
prices.
The clean.
Along with the restrictory.
Operation by itself in the
market the c.
Yeah.
However.
Is.
With all the respect.
Right
that there is an increase.
They are reported.
Yeah.
It's passed on to those those
hardest worries.
So for those re.
You are probably working.
So.
All yesterday I represent.
According to
the current gas price
three dollars and twelve cents
california four dollars.
States have much.
Higher guys prices the only
reason especially when you talk
about california certainly
is much higher than new mexico
reason.
Also increases
road raising the price mexicans
not results and economic roads
were going to increase the price
of gas mexico it would be better
just the slap attacks on it
without additional facts and
this would not have been
quality and while we are.
Trying to policies in the mexico
then
they can on the ground with an
arts work building during the
last year to call fire plans
everything
completely wife outside chinese.
My name is tom
hello
mexico i'm also the president of
the new mexico cattle growers
association
proposed minimum the improvement
activates the forty one i'm
trying to understand how it's
going to work in practice
particularly the rural new
mexico.
Especially for life stock
producers it really doesn't seem
likely that we're going to have
the infrastructure rural new
mexico to make collector.
At least not.
Won't remain the primary
transportation
in our areas we don't understand
rightly why there is a concern
with carbon intensity of
transportation fuels in rural
new mexico where we are
surrounded with grasslands
trades but what we do for the is
that the idea or some other
agency will claim based on it
tensity of gasoline and diesel
to impose taxes on this yours
mexico that would be as was
very.
Respectfully
we have
Or
those taxes that are paid for
those who were producing.
Thank.
Where the leading trade
associate.
Yeah.
We were not invited to the.
We are the association the
concerns assessment says there
is some.
We haven't been advised the
table and the draft.
Anything I want to break out.
Yeah.
Which is the
largest economy in the world
with that your.
The idea.
You do not have.
Will be.
So we're just.
For the credit and the gas
prices will go.
The first.
Okay.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
This.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
So.
Yeah.
The.
The.
The.
This.
Thank you for.
The.
The.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This.
Okay
The.
I.
The.
The.
The.
The.
The.
Yes.
The.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
Thank you mister chairman the
committee.
We're here to respect our full
support of the bill before this
morning I think we all agree
that we need to take all the
action we can to come back
climate change and the
transportation is a major
influence or on that climate
change this bill takes a
measured approach to reducing
the carbon intensity of all your
types which is what we need
we're not going to get to all
the vehicles in the next two
years and so we need to be
making sure that we reduce the
carbon intensity all fuels and
one thing I wanted to just
really mention is that this
we've heard a lot about costs
this morning but we have a lot
of people interstate
particularly children who are
being impacted by the ground
that comes from car from the
car.
A lot of children are
experiencing those families and
society and a lot of played a
lot of times our cost it's
costing three thousand dollars a
year to care for those children
with their I think that's a cost
that we should be looking at we
think about the ability to do
these kinds of programs that
will really reduce that carbon
intensity so for that reason in
lots of reasons you're gonna
hear about after me we.
I think
my name is jim i'm a coport
later of three fifty in mexico
organization
central partner myself over six
thousand.
Electricity.
And.
Apartment is one thing I learned
what I was in the service
but I was deployed was a concept
of collateral d.
So we're talking with this
morning about watson the whole
person sits with here
opposition from lobbyists or
worried about ten cents or
twenty cents
of bother going destiny
i'm read right what
a temporary film called.
For two one mistake.
Also industry as considered the
health of facts collectable
damage.
That helped effects of this
industry as real.
Only.
Or.
Mister chairman members of the
committee I am charles good
morning speaking to you on
behalf of both and rdc natural
resources defense council.
We thank representative or test
sponsoring bill and government
version for bringing it forward
to committee to support it is
built accelerate more efficient
forms transportation it will
help you mexico residents in
businesses save money on getting
around will help come solution
particularly pollution as
driving climate change which of
course fuels fires he related
emergency in some reasonable
years will reduce healthcare
switch reflected as a major
expense in the state budget
and severity the restaurant
health problems will be reduced
will generate funny that
businesses can use exolary clean
transportation solutions it will
generate important funding for
school districts which make the
switch from diesel school buses
to electricity business internal
do the same for any other
political suburban virtual.
Please yes.
The.
Thank you mister chairman
members of the committee
journalism has electric
we understand that an amendment
is in the work.
Yeah.
A good morning chair chair
committee members my name is
still in huge and the acting
secretary i'm here to voice
intersupport for each before you
want because it represents an
important fuel acknowledges tool
to help us decargonize our
transportation system which is
second most significant source
of co two emissions in the state
uses proven market mechanisms to
achieve its objective and
compliments the work that the
energy conservation in
management division the state's
energy office does through its
alternative your program thank
you for the opportunity to
comment.
Thank you mister chairman
members of the community
representative
transportation can help preserve
consumer choice even if it does
come out of slave increasing
cost with the standard new
mexico can accomplish admission
reductions on existing vehicles
because we're focusing on
reductions that are coming
through the whole life cycle of
the future.
And if we're serious about
addressing transportation really
can help achieve a mission
reductions faster about a lower
cost for society than other
alternatives
in the past and with.
More character and there was a
committee writing this damn
climate energy director with
conservation voters in mexico
and we stand in very strong
support I just built because we
prioritize policy that will dr.
Yeah.
I.
Creating thousands of.
Members.
My concern is I live in jackson
I own early.
Thirty years in the eighties
twenty four once
I can't since last week.
Thirty
one.
Are.
But they don't have a decent
august.
That.
Anything that can help address.
We need to.
The.
That.
I.
Will attract really good jobs
it helps
new businesses next meeting
existing one and.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The.
Good morning.
This in the eddy for animated
vote many of our communities
face outs health impacts from
industry and from pollution
from.
Clean cars and trucks
electric view vehicles in mexico
and most of our urban people
only drive an average of thirty
miles per day for roll longer
drives plug in hybrids are
perfect solution we think the
potential for transportation
electric trification that comes
from the being fuels program is
key to helping incentivise
vehicles that can
our air quality this will
apply to transportation feels
not.
It allows utilities to earn fuel
credits only for electric
vehicles and related
infrastructure that they bring
on not for electricity they
generate the bill drive funds
for investment and
transportation electricities and
does not allow for credits for
action ta.
For this and many other reasons.
Good morning.
Representing them and i'm
neither and.
Yeah.
It's before you.
A good path where your
environment like twenty forty
five it's been forty one can
make a dent.
And in the long brand contribute
to a better better health of our
people one fourth thing being
threatened that gas prices will
grow up is a great reason to die
first
please pass.
One of the largest.
And given that the rule nature
of our st requires to drive long
distances often with older cars
and I believe the collaborative
effort with diverse fuels can
help reduce greenhouse gas toxic
commissions.
Thank you mr chairman.
Representing.
And I think I want to make just
a very focused point and that is
that programs like this.
Have first directly regulated
and that's what the.
They heard and dropped on cars
and travel that will.
So this incentive program works.
And manufacturers want to bring
them here so by creating an
incentive program.
Custo.
Section session you're going to
be seeing.
Market that's based on dire.
Yeah.
Committee for the record my name
is
public affairs manager
support one and they give you a
little bit more company that's
the beginnings and all kinder
over seventy five years ago and
made the transition to a normal
feels about fifteen years ago
today the world's leading
producer.
I'm here today because we've
seen the benefits of similar
transportation standards along
the west coast and how effective
they can be and helping states
reach their dependation.
They're really too hard to this
policy the first is technicality
which allows for customers
work for them and their
businesses and the second is the
use of the great model developed
by our car intensity based on a
full life
we know that one size does not
at all and this policy is
flexible for customers to choose
the solutions that work fast for
them
today our purpose is simple
creating a cleaner planet for
our children I am very copy that
the chair would brought this
bill today and happy to answer
any questions if you.
The.
That stands and support forty
one.
Movie toward a clean
this bill is a coffee
walk to effort my dad.
This feel supports that effort
to increase needed
infrastructure state like we
also want to take the sponsored
at the end.
Okay.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's everyone we have.
Yeah.
The.
The.
The.
Yeah.
Figured out.
If you're listening.
So just be aware of that it's
going to go.
Yeah.
