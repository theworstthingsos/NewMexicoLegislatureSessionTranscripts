Representative Lara.
Representative Lord.
Representative Romero your.
Representative Thompson here.
Representative Rubio here
Representative Ferrary here.
I'm not sure what okay we have
to work.
Thank you thank you.
Thank you members of the
committee here today is the lady
or work with me
from Verizon is still planning
cramming which I think since
this is my fifth year in the
legislature this will be the
fifth time you hear this well at
least this bill
essentially modernizes the way
in which we are allowed to do
billing in the state with our
wireless providers so this first
bill was passed in nineteen
ninety nine we're updating it to
twenty twenty three home to
basically allow for standard
billing practices to be able to
add to billing so when you get
your bill if you want to add on
to that with like a special deal
that your wireless provider
maybe providing you and this
gives you the opportunity to do
that currently in New Mexico we
are the last state in the union
to not allow this practice so my
mom is very sad that she can't
have the discounted Disney plus
account with her provider so
that said madam chair we stand
for questions and all at doing
any introduced himself.
Thank you.
Madam chair and members of the
committee I am too lazy overwork
I go by the
the Legislative Council for
Verizon for the south region
which includes New Mexico.
Like the laws in all other
states Mexico telephone that The
New Mexico telephone billing
statute prohibits charges for
telecommunications services on
telephone bills that were not
authorized by the.
House bill one seventy does not
change that prohibition that
practice would be would continue
to be our lawful as it should
be.
The New Mexico statute also
prohibits charges for third
party services on telephone
bills that are not
telecommunication services
regardless of whether the
customer authorized.
They were not.
New Mexico is the only state
prohibits consumers authorizing
such charges.
House bill one seventy
modernizes The New Mexico
telephone billing statute rings
it in line with federal law and
the laws of all the other states
and gives.
Consumers choice.
Where the statute currently
defines illegal framing to
include quote charging a
customer for goods or services
they're not telecommunication
services.
Bill this spans seven were.
And we're not authorized by the
customer.
Consumer protections for
unauthorized charges would
continue to remain in place it
would be enforced by the public
regulation commission.
Three state agencies provided
comments to the legislative
finance committee on the bill as
noted the fiscal impact reports
none of those agencies pose the
bill.
The PRC for example describes a
statute prohibition on charges
or third party services as quote
part problematic close quote as
noted the fiscal impact report
the PRC states that H. B. one
seventy provides a needed
correction to exclude authorize
services from a definition of
cramming in statute.
The attorney general's comments
some things up well the Attorney
General states that when the
statue was passed four some
links here the intent was to
prevent wireline service
providers from adding charges to
customer bills for services they
were largely unrelated to
telecommunication services
however.
With the advent of wireline and
wireless broadband which are
commonly offered is bundled
services it is common for
providers to offer subscriptions
to their service to non
telecommunications services
social apps like apple music
networks which that appear on
the customer's bill accordingly
this bill clarifies such
practice is not contrary to
cramming and slamming.
These comments conform that the
bill comports with sound public
policy.
Madam chair members of the
committee thank you be able to
answer the questions.
managers one good thing we have
right T. mobile is also in favor
of this bill.
That wasn't the question here I
I got a text from vantage arms
that he's trapped as an expert
witness but T. mobile is in
strong support of.
So that will go to the audience
those opposition okay.
Those in opposition please raise
your hand.
Okay thousand support.
Okay and if.
I would like to what do we have
anyone on soon.
Okay it is what we just.
Is opposition or support for
okay we'll go to the audience

Yes it might be easier.
To hear you.
You madam chair members of the
committee my name is Chelsea
Canada and I'm the director of
public policy at the New Mexico
chamber of commerce I'm here to
speak in favor of house bill one
seventy as you heard the bill
brings New Mexico up to par with
the other forty nine states by
allowing our consumers to choose
to pay for digital media and
other third party services on
their telephone bills New World
where it's common to bundle
broadband video telephone and
other services house bill one
seventy just make sense the bill
promotes consumer choice while
maintaining important customer
protections this bill is good
for our state and we hope you
will vote for it we applaud the
sponsor for bringing this bill
forward thank you.
Thank you.
Madam chair members of the
committee my name is Marco
Gonzales I'm actually there

Madam chair members of the

here today to talk to you about
house bill one eighty electronic
storage of state records and
we're here Representative
she upon ski I think I said her
name properly because I asked
her how to pronounce it earlier
and I are sponsoring this bill
and really this is a really
straightforward bill although
probably a little bit still
archaic
this is us that our records be
maintained in an electronic
format and that that be the
public record and
and I I have to tell you
members
of the committee and
representative and madam chair.
It about thirty years ago I
worked in the state that tax and
revenue department and I did
this work.
So it's kind of like.
yes Sir a little like The
Twilight Zone going back in time
but it's kind of good I mean I
hope that we eventually move on
to something that's a little
more
technologically stoop but at
this point this is what we're
recommending is approval of this
bill and we do have an expert
here to discuss it if you have
questions.
Thank you thank you madam chair
I would just add that have I was
sort of stands to realize that
in statute official records were
I think at this point primarily
microstation at and so this is
really allowing us to move into
the modern era we're very
pleased to have with us justice
David Thompson
from the Supreme Court and also
Cassie hanging from the
administrative office of the
courts.
And with that will stand for
questions.
Go to the audience.
Go to the audience have is there

committee there are there any
questions okay exemplars thank
you madam chair representative
so I see here this is no fiscal
impact to there's going to be
zero fiscal impact whatsoever.
Madam chair of Representative
Lord according to what we
understand this would just be
absorbed by the operating budget
for each division.
Okay.
I just want to thank the justice

Mr **** thank you representative
madam chair and to the past
second.
It's been moved and seconded for

Okay.
Read about.
Two passed thank you madam chair
thank you members of the
committee thank one eighty.
We have our wonderful house bill
two eighteen Representative
Ortez.
You.
Please give us a second to get
us let's let's keep up the pace
yes.
It.
Madam chair committee.
To.
Thank you if you're ready go
ahead thank you madam chair
members of the committee you
have no idea how.
But I am to be appear presenting
this bill
H. B. two eighteen I will
improve utility affordability
and reduce energy burdens low
income New Mexicans.
New Mexico New Mexicans living
in rural low income communities
spends really high portion of
their income on utility bills on
average about fifty percent in
some counties that figure is
much higher over over twenty
percent even up to thirty forty
percent.
The experts tell us that five
percent is about what folks
should be spending on on their
utility bills from their income.
We know that when low income
families are paying that much
for utilities they are
overburdened and these hi to
leave payments may make it
difficult sure for folks to pay
for their rent for their food
for the medicine he do not want
New Mexicans to be put in this
kind of position to make that
kind of decision.
So this is what the bill does
investor owned utilities must
offer a low income right to
customers at the two hundred
percent of federal poverty level
they must also I was living with
the PRC by January first twenty
twenty four to include this rate
in all future rate cases and
report the progress to the PRC
every three years alleged co
operatives must provide low
income rates to customers Act
one hundred fifty percent of the
federal poverty rate upon filing
their next rate case.
There's a lot of support for
this bill including from my
experts who represents New
Mexico gas company and PNM
environmental organizations
faith based groups lots of low
income advocates I do have two
expert witnesses Act Apuseni Act
from UNM law school and Gerald
was seen from New Mexico gas
company
I stand for questions I'm sorry
to have an amendment and I would
like to that you should all
have.
I'm happy to be at the two oh
two number.
Yes.
This was prepared.
Two days ago been sent to your
committee.
Hi.
She started.
This year.
So we see.
Sorry.
I'm happy to.
What can come back in and you
can we can start again with a
unanimous decision madam chair
that.
Copy Mr chair.
Would you like me to read that
to a two number out.
One that we receive that January
twenty at maybe possibly okay.
We have to to to.
Two two four five eight two
point one.
This is the first one madam
chair.
If.
This
is.
That we already have copies.
Right now either so we'll take
care of the staffers.
Amendment four sessions.
Second.
Okay.
And would you like to explain.
I'll read the amendment
we've inserted language that a
rural legible cooperative that
chooses to offer such a right
prior to its next general rate
adjustment me recover any
reasonable cost implementing
that rates with existing rate
adjustment mechanism.
Or charge into next general rate
adjustments there is a co op
that would like to start process
earlier
so that we meet the competition
for that for that co.
Everyone just a minute sure yes
take your time.
So madam chair.
Just try to read this is one
sentence.
Because it is it is one thousand
from the start of page.
One now we're taking out of here
it and with adding a.
One.
And.
Like a two page center so.
Just give me.
We love the semicolon.
Madam chair what what's that
existing rate adjustment
mechanism look like.
Madam chair representative
Romero.
Thank you madam chair
Representative Romero it could
look like a few adjustment
charge or an an existing writer
that's already there so when
stating.
Who does that apply to madam
chair Representative is that
already to to ratepayers
generally.
Madam chair representative
meadow this allowances already
in in the bill it's in section
three for the IOUs so this is
Justin's insuring this amendment
allows the collapse to.
So offered their low income
rates more put.
Like to and that didn't quite
answer your questions but I
wanted to let you know that you
this this language in our was
already in here section dealing
with Iraqis after.
Yet again the the the reason for
this is because
in in conversations with our
rural cooperative the role
cooperative pointed out that it
was potentially more challenging
since cooperatives don't have as
much capital reserves and so
that's why the bill is designed
not to require cooperatives to
put in place an affordable rate
until their next regional spent
when they can figure out any
potential.
Right how to allocate those but
one cooperative said what we
don't want to wait that long we
want to offer it earlier but we
want to have some way until that
next.
And this is the mechanism they
suggest.
Senator Woods yes.
Change if they did it on their
own would it be under the
direction of the KRC.
They would just be able to do
it.
Madam chair this does not change
the existing status quo in terms
of how we will choose to be
cooperatives are right.
In that role to see cooperatives
as the default do not have to
set their own rates and they
don't bring that in front of the
PRC for regulation that said
there is a provision of public
utility act that allows a
certain portion of membership to
protest any right and that and
if there if the PRC findings
just because for that protest
and the PRC will require hearing
that mechanism remains unchanged
in this entire bill.
So Representative
What this means that they
lowered it for certain
Low income ratepayers they could
also raised at higher for other
repairs without going through
any process.
I thank you madam chair this
there's a kind of two part
question in that
For general rate adjustments so
Senator compartment for
cooperatives is that that they
don't they are not required to
offer an affordable rate until
the next general rate
adjustments and there's an
internal cooperative process for
notification the ticket was on
and so
it's not clear that offering a
low income right.
It's new costs because offering
a low income right I'm also has
benefits all right here's it
means what we've seen in other
states is that there are fewer
customers who are not paying
their bills there's fewer
customers who are defaulting on
their bills is your customers
were being shut off we need to
be reconnect all of that adds
cost we as ratepayers all paid
for the bad debt of utilities in
our rates and the goal behind
for rates to reduce those rates
there's also there's yeah we do
rates through right classes and
so we classes include smaller
businesses bigger businesses we
have an imperfect process of
trying to identify what the cost
of services to all rate classes
there is some reason to think
that offering I would choose the
service to lower income people
costs less than offering
electricity service to to
residential customers as a whole
because for example lower income
people are less likely to I an
extra refrigerator and put it in
if I'm not people do that then
there might need to be in
upgrading electricity
infrastructure we all pay for
those costs whether or not we
put in an extra refrigerator in
our house so it's not clear
whether there will be extra
costs if there are extra costs
and those costs to get recovery
through the ratemaking process
and that and again it doesn't
change how the U. cooperate.
Okay
Representative I'm not sure if
that was my question was
answered so can you raise the
rates the for your next right.
Increase to offset the lower
cost if you decide to.
Mr chair and after the within
margins of what is allowed by
the PRC or would they have to
approve it.
Thank you madam chair apologies
for not answering the question
previously yes they could charge
those initial cost to this
existing surcharge mechanism
until the next rate adjustments
to any cost anticipate it would
only go into the PRC if there
was a protest and Piercy found
that if there was just costs for
that project okay so there is a.
Process for people to check.
Okay right are there any other
questions from the committee.
The amendment yes I'm sorry on
the net.
I'm sure that option the
amendment second thank you.
For do pass on your amendment.
No objections okay.
Okay so you have an amended
bills
like to go ahead and speak about
the rest.
Chair members of the committee I
I can stand for questions.
okay we'll go to the audience
now.
At.
those in opposition of this
bill.
Okay.
And those who would like to
speak will start on the side.
Good afternoon again.
The members of.
Sent out the all to stand in
opposition or
right now due to four K. this is
referred to as non states we
don't have the option of.
Providing loan conversions in
New Mexico
the early December I'll pass a
elector again early December
was provided the opportunity to
have smart meters in our
territory.
And with those smart meters we
are having a lot of public
meetings to talk about right
how rates are constructed how
how we how are the once the
season.
And we would love to have low
income rates be part of that
conversation.
What.
but where where we have
opposition is in the mandated
two hundred percent for
use that's right around fifty
percent off as far as I.
Now I'm not no social
statisticians so I hope I have
the right.
Nation.
Right.
About eighty percent of our
families and for and.
Our inside of two hundred
percent that thirty second time
provided answers to help you.
Okay
And and so we have suggested to
the the sponsor of the bill that
we look at having permission.
For for the range and
and go from there the motions
are not off all that far but we
still hold out hope that we can
get to that point we would like
to have this bill passed this
legislative session thank you to
the sponsor thank you.
Anyone else in this.
Those.
The line.
Good again yes.
Thank you.
They're still reeling over here
move.
So madam chair members of the
committee good afternoon my name
is Bernard treat.
My getting feedback okay thank
you.
Sorry anyways madam chair
members committee Bernalillo
treat manager government affairs
for Xcel energy which is the
opko SPS serves the eastern part
of New Mexico in the panhandle
of Texas so today ma'am.
We just a we we do stand in
opposition but we we do think
that the Billsponsored
Representative Ortez for
improving the bill over the last
couple of weeks.
We.
And as you just heard we would
like to have the language
optional we do have
in and if we can get on top
optional we could we could
definitely support the bill we
do have a rate case before the
commission that we have proposed
low income.
Energy assistance plan so we
don't you know for our company
don't think the legislation is
needed at this time and if
The
If the bill currently is as
drafted had a filing date that
coincides with the next utility
rate case that we have to adjust
to avoid piecemeal.
Right making that would get us
to another position about
possibly neutral so madam chair
thank you.
Thank you.
Madam chair and members of the
committee thank you for into the
sponsor for bringing this
forward I am the CEO of the New
Mexico rural electric
cooperative association we
represent my name Sri Swanson we
were the Representative fifteen
of the co ops we are in
opposition of this bill.
I am disappointed today because
we had twenty leadership members
of our cooperatives and some of
our employees here this morning
some of the major over four
hours to be here however later
today we found that this had
been canceled today or roled
that was posted on outside of
the agenda on the on the agent
on the door and all of those
folks left because they felt
they believe that this is been
rolled so there's no way that I
could give them give you their
testimony we had about twenty
different stories of what they
wanted to say to you today I
can't say that our
infrastructure is different than
I use our economy is different
out in our rural communities and
we are in opposition this bill
we are greatly disappointed that
they could not be here today and
we look for forward having
further discussion.
Thank you.
What else in opposition.
Okay.
This is the law opposition.
On.
Good afternoon madam chair my
name is Leri Sonntag I'm a
member of better together New
Mexico a grassroots advocacy
organization that makes up
people from all over the state
all walks of life.
Respectfully oppose house bill
two eighteen.
New Mexico is ranked the third
poorest state in the nation
soaring inflation and rising
interest energy prices are
taking a heavy toll on New
Mexico Family.
This bill will only make the
situation worse permitting
because they would be forced to
subsidize the utility rates of.
I don't want anyone to suffer
from the lack of heating or
cooling but when you force
increased rates on others to
cover the costs for low income
you're creating additional
hardships it doesn't matter
where you draw the line for
poverty in the state
subsidizing costs for others
will push many of those who are
barely making ends meet into
poverty.
Consider those on a fixed income
budget can barely afford their
own utilities.
Any additional costs for these
folks maybe the difference
between barely covering their
daily expenses and having to
skip meals or prescriptions that
refills by encouraging you to
vote no on house bill two
eighteen thank.
What have you.
Hello I'm actually in favor of
the bill should I speak now or.
Sure going.
You madam chair and members of
the committee my name is Maria
Griego and I'm an attorney with
the New Mexico Center on Law and
Poverty.
Your stand in support of this
bill because about seventy two
thousand households in New
Mexico are living on extremely
low incomes under thirty
thousand dollars a year and
roughly eighty four percent of
those households are cost
burdened meaning they spend more
than thirty percent of their
income on rent and utilities
these are households that are at
risk of homelessness because
they're spending too much of
their income on rent and
utilities this bill will help
low income New Mexicans better
be able to afford their housing
costs meaning they're more
likely to stay state we have.
So for your for these and other
reasons given in your state we
support house bill two eighteen
and and thank the sponsor for in
the bill.
At.
Madam chair that maybe other
people speaking in support in
the room I hope so really.
In the room.
Start working.
there
are.
Our office.
I didn't want to be presenters
madam chair but.
Yes people which is.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon madam chair and
committee my name is merry on
the nasty and I'm with new
energy economy we agree and
support state efforts to
recognize equity is a goal of
utility regulation going beyond
the traditional traditionally
stated objectives to ensure that
electricity systems are reliable
safe and fairly priced the main
objective that.
Action that new energy economy
has to this this.
Form of this bill is that it
sure is low income right making
by giving all the discretion to
utilities and and removes
commission oversight that is the
primary objection that we have
we just support this is the
Senate just confirmed a new PRC
and they need to do their job
which is to be able to oversee a
utility and anything that you to
eight does I would prefer I'm
just saying that the Sanchez and
the bill drafters and the
organizations in support that
they make the right design not
the utility because then we
could ensure that there was
actual
That we know that it would be
cost effective and also just
effective in general we have
done this before we give all the
power to the utilities and take
away the commission oversight
and that has frankly not worked
so I would like to work with the
bill drafters and then and the
sponsors to take out that those
requirements and otherwise I
support not only the intent but
this actuating this because I
think that Rico it was wrong
there is that's why we need this
bill we need this bill to change
the law mountain states the
Supreme Court case said that the
PRC can't do it we need
legislation to do it and so
that's why I support the bill
just not in its current form and
I hope that we can amended thank
you so much.
You madam chair members of the
committee Robert Romero on
behalf of Kit Carson Dr co up
thank you Carson's a little bit
different position than the
other clubs without.
Can you that better okay I can
questions in a little bit
different position than any
other clubs and with all due
respect to the coops in twenty
fifteen to Carson actually
proposed lowincome right but
because of the state's lawsuit
it was delighted the PRC we do I
think the sponsor for the
amendment we think this helps
helps get Carson group of do a
low income right to and to and
we support this bill thank you.
Good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee share
growing our register dial
lobbyist PNM thank you we want
to thank the sponsor for her
leadership in we also want to
thank the community partners for
working on this important piece
of legislation we believe this
is an important step to helping
the most in need in our state
according to our estimates close
to fifty percent of our
customers are two hundred
percent below the pop federal
poverty level line.
With family struggling with
rising costs everywhere we want
to be able to propose a low
income rate for the PRC to
consider PNM is happy to stand
in support of HB to eighteen
thank you.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee David Hotmail I'm

reality is there are thousands
and thousands of New Mexicans
thousands and thousands of New
Mexico families that live in the
City of Albuquerque and
Bernalillo county who are about
to face really really tough
choices as we hit the coldest
coldest parts of the winter do
you buy groceries do you pay
your electric bill what do you
do do you heat your home it as
the professor pointed out the
reality is when those folks
don't pay their bill it does
affect all rate payers it does
already because of that burden
will shift eventually to other
ratepayers when these folks
can't make their bill can't
can't pay their bills can't make
their payments thanks offer it
just prolongs the suffering this
is a sensible solution to that
well known problem and we
applaud the sponsor for working
with the stakeholders to try to
address their issues and we urge
the committee to pass the bill
thank you.
At noon madam chair members of
the committee Amy very
registered lobbyists for the New
Mexico gas company Gerald's the
scene is our expert here so
we're obviously very supportive
just want to express sincere
gratitude to the sponsor and
everybody here who has
collaborated to come up with
this legislation even my
colleagues at Accel and EP have
noted that there has been true
since year collaborative efforts
throughout this entire process
which has gone on for over six
months and that doesn't happen
all the time with legislation so
that is a credit to everybody
who worked on this and
especially the sponsor thank
you.
Thank you.
Madam chair members of the
committee on Charles good marker
and I'm speaking to you on
behalf of two working as Asians
right now at both are action
funds natural resources defense
council or NRDC and New Mexico
voices for children action fund
so we're also want to thank the
sponsor and happy to be standing
here of build support supported
by so many industry folks as
well just want to make the point
that twenty other states have
low income utility rates at
state including Arizona and
Colorado so it's proven that
this can work and
Just ask for your support for
the bill thank you.
Hello madam chair members of the
committee Gwendolyn Gallagher
aging and long term Services
Department according to the US
bureau of economic analysis from
twenty twenty to twenty twenty
one in New Mexico that cost of
household utilities increased
six percent all in addition
at according to the US Census
bureau thirteen percent of New
Mexicans age sixty five years
and older are living below the
poverty level so passing House
bill two eighteen would result
in lower utility costs providing
much needed assistance to older
adults I'm living with financial
insecurity aging a long term
Services Department supports
house bill two eighteen.
Good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee loose
Garratt a with the circled I'm
gonna chapter representing our
thirty five thousand members
throughout New Mexico and West
Texas as well we strongly
support this bill I was trying
to do some math in my head but
I'm terrible at math but
anywhere between fifty to
seventy percent of
Sorry families can spend
anywhere between fifteen to
seventeen seventeen percent in
some cases the utilities up to
thirty seven percent in rural
areas and I was trying to do the
math in my head of how much that
would be for my family and
trying to think of the
sacrifices that we may have to
make in order to pay bills or
you know feeders self pay are
you know their mortgage pay for
car other the bills that we that
that that we may have and just
thinking of that's a decision
that a lot of families have to
make throughout New Mexico so
we're asking for your support
thank you very much for the
opportunity today.
You madam chair members of the
committee.
My name is on the border and I
would prosperity workers I've
been an intervener on behalf of
low income people before the
public regulation commission for
almost twenty years and this has
been an issue during all of that
period so I'm thrilled to see
this proposal for you today.
We have provided energy is that
the patients see assistance to
low income people in New Mexico
starting about four years ago
with our first three hundred
people seventy five percent of
those people were living on
twenty five thousand dollars a
year or less in a family size of
two to five that same number had
sacrificed food medicine and
medical care for back to pay
their energy bills home energy
is an essential commodity and it
has to be affordable
sustainable.
So for those reasons I ask you
for your support today and one
of the things I'd like you to
think about also use the
possibility of comparing those
investor owned utilities
directing to this their bottom
lines to the bottom lines of the
people that we serve thank you
for your consideration.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee and Tammy people
Cornyn was southwest energy
efficiency project and you may
be thinking that this is that
something that that thing you
because you have seen a proposal
for the last three years in a
row to get low income rates for
New Mexicans that are in need
and it's been a minute out of
bills for the last three years
we are so happy that we've been
able to work with New Mexico gas
company PNM K. Carson and others
to really bring you a proposal
this year that works that works
for working class New Mexicans I
just can't tell you how many
times over the past three years
with the calls of come into me
from folks who say I'm having to
choose between paying my utility
bill and paying for medicine I
have to choose between paying
for my utility bill and paying
to.
To put food on the table for my
children and those are not good
choices I have never had to make
those choices and I certainly
don't want other New Mexicans to
have to make those choices I
also just want to point out that
we've heard a lot of
conversation today about making
it permissive are optional and I
would just say to you know there
are New Mexicans in need right
now they do not need to wait
until an industry professional
decided they get help they need
help right now in this bill is
designed to make sure that they
get that as soon as possible so
I ask you to please support this
bill thank you.
Around
the time.
Yes yes good afternoon chair and
committee and thank you sponsors
for the bill my name is John
Brown I'm a Franciscan sister
and director of New Mexico
interfaith power and light and
we are very happy that this bill
is getting this far our faith
community see this as a
responsibility to love our
neighbors and some of our
neighbors are more vulnerable
than others we have a common
good responsibility to care for
one another in addition of
number of faith communities help
out when people cannot pay their
utility bills so this will ease
some of the burden there and
allow for other sorts of needs
that people have so we're very
grateful thank you so much.
Yes.
Thank you madam chair Ferrari
and members of the committee my
name is Sammy Calpine decline in

the bill for reasons you very
hard we're also very
enthusiastic about the
collaboration with investor
owned utilities and the collapse
looking out for our most
vulnerable vulnerable community
should be a collective effort so
for those reasons we are just
part of this bill today thank
you.
This is a.
Yes.
Right here.

It.
The.
Hello can you hear me.
Okay sorry about that.
Hello madam chairwoman members
of the committee my name is Erin
Lee and I'm here to speak in
strong support of house bill two
eighteen I'm in New Mexico gas
company right Karia living
Cochiti pueblo and I experience
high rates just like everyone
else in the community I work two
jobs and to meet my basic needs
and living expenses usually with
a little was able to save and if
it is this hard for me as a
young person living on my own to
keep my home and the team I
mental stability well I cannot
imagine how hard it is for
families who are struggling or
single parents we had even more
limited resources to meet their
basic needs this bill would
immensely help so many families
around Mexico and it would
emphasize the value community
that our leaders should embrace
I urge the committee to pass
this bill thank you.
I.
Thank you very much.
Well I am speaking on behalf of
H. B. two one eight I
specifically want to address
some of the legal arguments that
were presented.
This bill does not take away any
of the commission's Authority to
approve right which are just and
reasonable
really what this bill is
proposed to do is to give
authority to allow the utilities
if our state to finally.
For a low income right.
Rates that would create at a
class lowincome class which the
law recognizes and allows this
rate would not be discriminatory
and it it would allow for so
many New Mexicans to finally
four
Electricity here at a at a rate
that they can Hey they can.
Four
so anyway anyhow I speak.
In support of the bill and they
I have.
Read the committee to support as
well.
But.
Madam chair and committee
members my name is Stephanie
widespread I'm with three fifty
New Mexico especially rural
advocacy and it's many of our
residents in rural areas in
particular have the largest
Energy burden in their budgets
compared to urban areas so for
that reason we strongly support
HB two eighteen thank you very
much.
You
madam chairman okay.
Before we get started.
In
the.
That.
This afternoon.
Okay.
You can.
The business you need five one
eight one five.
To.
A request for
has.
that
But.
Just go ahead and.
Thousand transliteration
the holders.
Legislative acts the.
It is that.
Combination.
I.
Four one ten.
Right the.
State to.
I'm H. for like ten to strike
here.
And so it was.
we need the definition of
affordable just that our staff
one.
Sorry.
A request to strike out going
into the hearing and I'm each
for one twelve straight this
year yeah.
And insert in the there a
semicolon in the end so that we
after members to meet the
definition of affordable right
is that what you're trapped in
section one of this section in
that in your number three
were developed after soliciting
the nonbinding recommendations
on this line.
Alright.
Madam chair I love the friendly
amendment and this is one.
To to accept.
Because.
Few minutes documents.
I just have some questions about
it just has more statutory
structure because we're just
looking at.
Moving the
On page four line ten we took
out the semi quantitative here
we so I think we have to then
bump out.
Why program
page four line seven.
We would have to make that
subsection bees.
Because it doesn't we have to
change the star of the sentence
on.
Yes.
Hi a cessation to.
Yeah changes full sentence to
start a new sentence.
We don't have a Representative.
Between yeah between lines
eleven through eleven and twelve
now
You just have to re write the
sentence because a.
This section.
The.
At three.
We struck out the.
Okay so you're saying I'm making
that makes the answers thank you
this this is.
It.
Okay.
Thank you madam chair it was
regarding the last three so as
we're developing after
considering the non binding
recommendations so I guess this
would bring people to the table
that it would not mandate them
to consider.
What they said is that correct
after.
Correct if they would
that still be under but PRC
sites.
Okay thank you madam madam chair
maybe respond to that question
as well.
Madam chair Gerald seib from New
Mexico gas company this language
is consistent with language that
is in statute for the
development of energy efficiency
programs.
And so there's a process with
developing energy efficiency
products a program should have a
stakeholder engagement process
to have that be open and
transparent and when we present
the programs that programs have
that completed it but there if
you will is an obligation on the
aisle you taken that are
presented because the PRC takes
that into account of the proof.
Madam chair representative black
and they they must consider in
the solicit and consider.
Okay the recommendations.
Thank you the answer my
question.
Thank.
This.
Thank.
Okay now we're back on.
Tell.
Representative.
Thank you madam chair so I just.
If there's like a study done
statewide to see how this could
happen it maybe a memorial in
the past I'm not sure was there
anything done statewide meeting
privately or publicly that would
have examined how this could be
implemented what the
ramifications could be madam
chair.
Madam chair representative but
there have been analyses of
energy burdens around the state
eight I don't know if there have
been any memorials or state
funded studies but there have
been lots of the people in the
room have been working on
Young looking at how to help low
income folks reduce their energy
part and but perhaps my.
It's can weigh in here.
Thank you madam chair
Representative block there was
again I don't think there's
anything you just look at how to
implemented but for example of
report by PSE healthy energy
that was reduce that was not
published I believe last year on
a climate equitable climate and
and public health policy
specifically look at energy
burden and identify the Energy
burden challenges in our state
among others thank you madam
chair and thank you
Representative Ortez an expert I
will refer to that look at that
so I appreciate that it's
important and then going forward
in this bill I see that there's.
F. I R. I will please page.
If
you believe that by our.
And under
fifty years.
To eighteen.
Those
taxpayer funded program so.
What I'm reading here is that
the right there would be the one
that takes the cost this the
state of directly to taxpayers
that correct madam chair.
Madam chair representative block
that is that is the case.
Yes.
Representative let me explain
how that works.
Thank you madam chair
representative block.
So it's it's not clear that
there will be right impacts
there may be it's not clear
because this creates a new rate
payer class of low income
customers and
there will be that does get
there will be a revenue
generated from those customers
and that revenue may cover the
cost of service to those
customers and may not and the
reason that it might do that
even though the rates will be
lower than for other residential
customers is because there are
ways in which providing services
lower rates low income customers
will first of all reduce costs
for all ratepayers again we've
talked about that the fact that
will reduce this connections it
will reduce reconnection costs
will reduce
the bad debt costs all of us
paid already the bill collection
costs for every time somebody
doesn't pay their bill that
additional mailings have to be
sent out the other thing that we
don't know I'm is whether or not
the cost of service to lower
income people will be lower we
know that in some other states
they have seen a lower cost of
service lower income people in
part that's because there are
studies that show that lower
income people are more likely
not to sheeter from sufficiently
in the winter because they don't
have they're worried about
choosing between their groceries
or their heating bills and
they're less likely to I'm
perfect to fully cool their
house in the summer or even have
air conditioning and so I'm
upgrades that might need to be
made to address the system for
example to account for increased
demand to peak demand I'm I'm
not necessarily going to come
equitably from lower income
customers so this bill doesn't
we don't know whether will
create increased costs in part
because it asked the commission
to weigh in on what is going to
be the what is the definition of
an affordable rate that's the
commission's asked if.
Further prescribed that by order
or rule in because it will have
this process that requires
public input I'm to the utility
to design what those rates look
like and the bill expressly
allows for many different
designs are different kinds of
designs so we don't know the
impact it might end up with some
cross sensitization if it is we
expect it to be small but there
are there are situations where
we've seen where there is no no
subsidy required.
Thank you madam chair thank
Representative Ortez thanks for
your name to be able to repeat
again real disconnect from
source It professor at
university in New Mexico school
of law right thank you so much I
don't want to just call you Mr
expert.
Thank you madam chair thank
Representative so it's just a.
I was concerned I guess a little
bit we don't know what impact
this could have we haven't done
these studies statewide related
memorials.
We wouldn't know how that could
negatively affect one of the
things that it probably is to be
small but I would just need to
put this as a burden on our co
up to work very hard to produce.
Introducing electricity to are
our different communities
especially money it's more rural
community and we rely on things
like Mike PNM and other places
that produce that so I just
wanna make sure we're not going
to throw a wrench into the
process so thank you madam chair
thank you Representative Ortez
can experts
So.
Forward here I was.
On the first page.
It says under B. says every
public utility providing
electric or natural gas.
Customers shall offer.
A portable rates for low income
residents and customers so.
That's a mandate which works
out.
And so I'm guessing the rule
making process be with peers
that madam chair representative.
Madam chair representative lot
the rulemaking does happen at
the PRC for items but that does
not happen for the cops.
Unless there's a protest thank
you madam chair representative
so I see the effective date of
the bill is July first twenty
twenty three so unexpected.
Concept of the bill would then
be mandated that they shall
reduce the costs for low income.
Customers madam chair
Representative works with.
Just.
You
madam chair
Representative block
Going to let me again and then
Respond to that question.
C..
So there there's two different
timelines one for investor owned
utilities electoral comment more
on that and one for cooperatives
with Cooper for like to
cooperatives recognizing that
they're smaller entities with
less staff let's capital there
is no requirement for them to
offer an affordable rate until
their next rate adjustments.
and they'll as a teacher of.
Madam chair.
For for New Mexico gas company
that would mean that we would
have to have propose low income
right by January first twenty
twenty four.
And then there's a second piece
of that which is that we would
need to include.
Low income rate in our next rate
case.
Okay thank you madam chair and
thank you Representative
experts.
All right.
So it's different for costs
versus other utilities so thank
yes so going on I see that we're
portable right.
There is a definition but I feel
like it doesn't specify exactly.
What that affordable rate would
be you know I I would I would
hate for this to become law
certain.
Entity decides what we're
calling it a portable right now
it's two cents three cents lower
so you should just be happy with
that is there any concern or any
stipulations in this bill that
would protect those customers
chair representative from.
Madam chair representative black
on this bill directs the PRC to
provide further guidance through
rulemaking or orders to
establish with that
affordability is they can they
can look at a lot of things in
they can also build out a lot of
things including like you.
Which is the right and gas range
together what.
They can do something that's
unaffordable if it's you six
percent of your annual income
your monthly income so with the
peers will be doing that and I
want to also let you know that
you state the utilities can
implement but the right looks
like in a lot of different ways
it could be a lower per kilowatt
charge you could be a flat
dollar amount rate I could be at
percentage rate reduction so
that you know the PRC will be
working on developing those
guidelines with input thank you
madam chair and thank you
Representative experts so they
going down to a low income on
page two.
What he's utilities UPS how
would the.
So.
What specifically low income.
Help Madam chair representative
how would they know.
Has that six percent of the
income cap madam chair.
Chair representative Jack.
Utilities already have a
mechanism for identifying
customers who qualify under
certain income levels for
specific programs typically that
does not require I'm asking for
income information for example
the low income she he energy
assistance program lie he which
is a federal program that
provides
subsidy from winter heating or
cooling crisis assistance it's a
really critical programs it
doesn't do enough it only
provides a one time payment of
between seventy and four hundred
ninety dollars in this state and
we see through our energy burden
levels and it's not able to
address that but for example the
way that people qualify for that
utilities check on the
qualifications that is a hundred
fifty percent of federal poverty
level and utilities will check
against their customer needs to
consider database maintained by
the department of Human Services
HSD Human Services Department
because the Human Services
Department qualifies those
individuals and HSD has the
ability to allow utilities to
check for other programs with
higher percentages of income
eligibility going up to two
hundred percent for example and
so the idea is that unless you
to only want to change the way
that it does things we do the
same thing you ask customers if
they're qualified and they would
run those names by HSD.
All thank you madam chair and
thank you Representative and
that so.
Would this be what you have to
often through.
The federal government or L. I.
H. E. AP I think madam chair.
Or whatever so what do you need
to file with the government
federal government first to get
the state.
Madam chair representative.
Madam chair representative there
there could be other ways of
doing it but that's the way that
is the way that we know work so
far so this bill does not
prescribe everything there are
we know that not enough people
qualify for these programs we're
hoping that by offering a low
income right more people will
choose to get this assistance
including like keep in energy
efficiency assistance all of
which will help together
And that's one mechanism the one
that is most commonly used to
qualify.
Okay thank you Sir.
Madam chair representative from
utility perspective people we we
would like to make this as
simple as we can for our
customers.
And we do not want to do the the
income tax for the adjudication
of that and so using existing
mechanisms or tools reduces the
requirement for people to do
more paperwork to go through
another process and to your
share information both the ring
come up with other personal
circumstances so we believe this
is the best way to actually get
out that target use existing
mechanisms that they already
have with other federal
government or the state all they
need to show proof of that and
then they get up and that that
they're eligible for the program
I will say as well that the one
of the things that we will need
to do what we have this right in
place is make sure customers or
we do know that sometimes
customers don't put their hand
up and so there's you know I
think there's no obligation our
part to make sure the customers
know that's there and that we
what we need to make sure that
they get access to okay thank
you madam chair representative
so that would I guess the person
of telling people about this
would be on the utilities clubs
Madam chair representative but I
would feel that burden from the
New Mexico gas perspective I I
also think the partners that
we've been talking to in
designing this legislation will
probably not be too shy about
making sure people as well thank
you madam chair thank
representative Fund that's the
question I would you know if I
was someone yes thank you this
bill today.
I guess my interest would be to
not tell everybody the mother
about this because it could
potentially save you money.
Do you do you have any kind of
safeguard from not implementing
this or not.
giving information to every
customer about this you need to
the law madam chair
representative.
Which.
Madam chair.
Representative dot.
Utilities are required to report
every three years to the editor
C. on how this program is
working you know and and and
what it looks like.
Coops are in a different time
for that.
Actually they don't have to do.
I think that's really important
in chair representative block
that you know we will be getting
it appears you'll be getting
information that utilities will
be giving that information that
you know that that's a
transparent process.
The the folks in the room will
know that that's happening and.
This program will just.
Be improved okay because of that
process you Representative Ortez
yeah I just if we were to
implement this answer want.
We always know that.
There are some people you know
Madam chair representative like
there's no way that there won't
be a full media a full court
press.
The rules there that keep that
there so I appreciate that so
going into the fiscal impact of
this bill I don't see that there
is a fiscal impact this year but
since it goes into effect I
believe for some next year
this is indeterminate a
substantial Madam chair
representative so that it's
so vague I am not sure what
exactly it would cost so is
there anything from
gas or anyone that make.
Estimate.
Entity what this could cost
Madam chair representative.
We don't have a specific item
chair representative I don't
have a specific answer from
except to say that in putting
this.
Including this in our rate case
process.
actually helps because there's a
lot goes into that and this
would be just one small
component of it so it's not a
standalone process where you're
bringing lawyers in New and
arguing about the low income
right.
The PRC will look at this and
then we will bring it forward in
the right case of small pieces
but overall so I think that that
the for profit cost of actually
thank you for having a is
probably pretty negligible
against the class that I.
Costa Rica Sanchez okay thank
you madam chair and thank you
Representative.
At so earlier I think you guys
talked about there's a different
staff rates for different
entities.
Representative somewhere.
Allotments so.
So it I guess my question would
be so there's the ratepayers of
homes thanks and then there's
all other repairs that don't
qualify for this program.
Businesses and other places that
accurate madam chair Madam chair
representative block there are
lots of different kinds of
payers right classes that's it
that included dust real
commercial residential.
Thank you madam chair
representative so with any of
these small businesses for
instance be able to qualify for
this number right Madam chair
representative Madam chair
representative but this is for
residential customers on the low
income residential customers
okay thank you madam chair thank
you Representative.
And I think it was brought up
earlier I want someone
attendance I forget who they
were talking about this mountain
states legal foundation versus
New Mexico racing Commission K.
and so is do you see any
problems with implementing this
law with this new Supreme Court
order.
Madam chair representative.
Madam chair representative blot
I am going to let the those
those earlier address it but it
is not an issue in fact it is we
are the legislature can do this
that's what that cases and go
into detail.
Thank you madam chair
representative black as as
Representative Ortez said didn't
the nineteen eighty four
mountain states case was in New
Mexico to New Mexico Supreme
Court case where the court was
asked to weigh in on whether the
what was that predecessor to the
PRC could approve basically a
low income rate for telephone
service at that time and in that
case the Supreme Court said no
the PRC does not have the
authority to do to authorize
this kind of right however
there's two important things
first in that case the Supreme
Court said that is the job of
the legislature
in so that is why I'm we bring
this to you establishing social
programs the the elderly and it
includes indigenous segment of
our society the proper function
of the legislature second the
actual constitutional provision
that was at issue in that case
which require that just that
just and reasonable that is no
longer in the constitution the
constitution was amended in the
amendment to that says that the
commission shall
at the responsibility of
regulating public utilities as
provided by law meaning that as
provided by the laws that you
all as the Legislature establish
so they're still the requirement
debt rates be just and
reasonable as there should
requirement applies to these
affordable rates under this bill
however as twenty other states
have decided it is within the
legislature's authority there's
no constitutional constraint on
that anymore to determine
whether affordable rate is just
and reasonable and that's what
this bill would do expressly
state that residential low
income affordable rates are are
under still prohibition against.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
Representative so couple quick
more questions I apologize but
so going back to the the
testimony earlier he said that
the success discussing state
funding for co ops.
It was regarding you know
collection rates and legal fees
and things like that do not like
on average what the utility pays
for these kinds of cost madam
chair which.
Representative sure that has
anything to do with the bill
thank you madam chair well I
guess my question this phase of
the project thank you so I guess
since we're saying that this
bill could state money for
utilities.
Do we have any figures that
could so what this bill would
do.
Regarding those fees that are
being paid currently active
Representative.
Madam chair representative I
don't know the number for you
Customer service is it is I've.
All of the cost of utility
equipment allocated across rate
classes and so when we bring
forward this right we would be
required to identify for the PRC
the savings that we think would
be cheap the costs that we think
that with if there were cost the
cost that that would result and
then when we were in for right
K. there's a process before it
gets approved on allocating
rates in the us all the parties
to the case at have a state and
that and that that gets settled
over to date we have I think the
markets that we think where
there might be savings but not
not dollars.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so I guess
closing your I just would like
to stay you know we all want
lower rates for people.
Across the board and I know in
the last few years.
Changing.
Policies globally here.
I we've seen ramifications of.
These folks that are producing
energy and natural gas and
things in our communities I
think that we've just seen an
astronomical price I mean I I
would my utility bill and I am
on my my my mouth just dropped.
It was kind of horrifying but we
want to make sure these people
to have access to to heating
their home I mean that's the
basic requirements like so I.
You know I know that policies in
the past have not helped
necessarily the cost of energy
state and the nation but you
know I'm not sure if this is the
solution to this problem I think
it could maybe be but I would
definitely need to look more at
the data and so I will look at
the study that you talked about
I appreciate the time today
thank you.
Representative will.
Thank you madam chair and
representative so I'm gonna tell
you why voting no on this bill
because I don't know nothing
about it it was on the board it
was off the board and then it
came back on and I'm a deep dive
person in this is like one bill
of research I do tremendous
amount of research as not a
voting no one of this I can't
phone in a boat bill I don't
know enough about I haven't
heard from my own coop my
district is central New Mexico
look to call up I did hear that
was a tremendous amount of
people heard earlier really
wanted to testify and I can't
vote without hearing both sides
it's not fair to them it's not
fair to me so in to like can
hear all the arguments on both
sides measurement Committee and
the nice things like mandates
and and everything price
increases for other people I
can't really do a deep dive in
to see what goals about so thank
you madam chair.
You just
have.
Okay we have a motion working
fast on.
As twice.
Correct.
Thank you I.
the state well.
Representative what no and I
would like to quickly explain.
Representative Lord now.
Representative Romero.
Representative Thomson yes.
Vice chair Rubio yes.
Chair for our yes.
And Representative.
Madam chair we have a vote of
forty two.
Thank you madam chair I will
wake up from so my vote was not
necessarily because they don't
agree with this bill it was just
because thank Representative
Lord I just time to talk with
the the advocates but I need to
remind you my County so it
certainly I want to have this
discussion in the future we will
on the floor so I would for that
but right now I'm no I'm I
appreciate you for principal
thank you.
Representative passed on house
bill two eighteen is by appended
of forty two thank you very much
thank you.
The.
Second.
Okay.
B. R..
we have house bill one ninety
Leader Chasey on issued a
certain great jury evidence.
And I believe you have a an
expert on soon.
Share.
Please allow artists to the
committee as my other experts.
This is my two thousand and was
our judiciary.
Committee your list and majority
analysts as well.
So we want to get this out.
It was just out of line.
Great.
There.
Hello hi Michael.
So you will
reference so he knows when he
needs to correct.
So I don't need to use this is
just the folks coming up from
that right.
To.
Madam chair Hospital one ninety
is actually it's legislation
proposed in response to a twenty
eighteen
how it decision saying that the
legislature needs to clarify
what's required at a grand jury
now if I got any of that run I'm
going to what Mr stout
Explain that but I think
probably he would be the best
one as Mr stout please make do a
quick summary they have an
analysis from the
this impact report they have
their majority minority analyses
and committee and offices so
they may have questions but go
ahead and give us a summary
okay.
Thank you madam chair thank you
can you hear me yes we'll let.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee.
Twenty years ago in two thousand
three the this legislature.
S. state statute that mandated
that evidence before a grand
jury will be closed lawful
competent and relevant quote.
However in in the meantime in
that time that standard that
this legislature passed has not
been in for standing as a
Representative Chasey said I
want to go the New Mexico
Supreme Court opinions State V.
Martinez in two thousand
eighteen.
Eliminated retracted its own
rule which was the same
languages proposed in this bill
saying that this is a this is
fine but the legislature needs
to get according to the court to
review that evidence so house
bill one ninety quite simply
fixes that by giving the
authority to the court to review
of the procedures and the
evidence to the grand jury.
The only thing the only
consequence of that can be that
the lovely greatest consequence
of that could be a
of dismissal without prejudice
meaning it would just be sent
back to to get a ride we can't
the case can't be tossed
anything like that
this does not change any other
grand jury proceedings and
juries are still.
Private secret there is no cross
examine the witness cross
examination of witnesses there's
no presentation of witnesses
sent by the target specifically
so all of the other procedures
for the grand jury will remain
the same under this bill
so it's not a.
Particularly dramatic changes
just the it's an enforcement
mechanism that has not been used
since it the there has not been
self enforcement or enforcement
of the opposite relevant and
lawful evidence standard over
the years so I think.
I'm happy to answer it is many
questions if anybody would like
to have but I think that's a
sample.
I hope the the clear explanation
of it in the simplest form madam
chair thank you.
What other quick.
No madam chair I I did a little
criminal law but not anything a
felony level except for one case
and so.
I can't tell you how quickly it
all proceeds against a potential
defendant and in the case that I
had.
Our something occurred over the
weekend I got a call from this
gentleman and ended up on a
Sunday is not to report
That it's not a preliminary
hearing or anything it's just
science letting people know
whether they're there
David Michael what's that.
The first hearing.
I'm sorry did you write any time
at the arraignment of the I
didn't Ramon okay the
arrangement was see I didn't do
much for a lot of.
So
Once I heard the story I
immediately started working on
the case by the deadlines were
such that I could barely it down
I had to have a list of
The the target of the grand
jury.
Can appear
but cannot bring Helsel and I
found out.
The my.
Client had a bunch of witnesses
who were there who said to him
go report to the supervisor what
this nurse did to your child.
And
So I I did get a letter in in
time just like barely us the
judge in charge of the great
injuries to require that certain
evidence be presented I it's
really frightening because.
If you are going to be named as
a target you have almost no time
whatsoever the one thing this
does is provide a little bit
more time for those who
incarcerated and then for those
who are not incarcerated what
the way I read it it gives the
it individuals council a more
reasonable timeline to gather a
lot of information fast to get
to the point so with that I
think we should stand for
questions madam chair.
Thank you.
Anyone in opposition.
Okay service gentleman the back.
You yes.
Thank you Mr to the reform yes
please.
At two minutes.
could not good morning or good
evening achieving madam chair
members of the committee so I
have been prosecuting for
approximately thirteen years
former district attorney here in
the first now currently I
counsel with the administrative
office of district attorneys I
can tell you there are a few
things that discrepancies that I
did hear first of all council is
allowed to prince Council is
allowed they are allowed to
present evidence and their
client is lot to testify before
a grand jury
second with regard to.
One of our main concerns with
the AODA
requiring.
Requiring that the rules of
evidence supply would require us
let's say for a victim of sexual
violence or sexual assault or
any violent crime would have to
then be present to testify when
currently they are not because
if the rules are in supply are
we have that direct testimony or
it's not allowed.
Furthermore I can give you just
a general example from my own
practice
I had a trial with the child
victim where we went to trial we
had a verdict of or excuse me a
hung jury of ten for guilt to
for not guilt and when I
approach that family to retry
the case they said it was just
too too dramatic.
That's ten for guilt to for not
guilty news too traumatic so we
couldn't retry that case and
that individual locked so with
that madam chair members of the
committee I ask that you vote
against this bill thank you.
I'm sure I did we have his name.
Sir could you I apologize of
funding is more concerned.
Okay next for opposition.
Like to speak.
Madam chair members of the
committee state your name please
my name is.
Excuse me my name is member of
the deputy chief of the New
Mexico state police and I stand
on your behalf of the department
in opposition to the bill.
This bill as it stands is going
to cause a hardship on not just
the state police but let law
enforcement as a whole typically
the situations involved just a
single Casey Jenner
investigative agent that's going
to have a majority of everything
should be presented in as it
stands this would essentially
require entire investigative
unit for a team to take it off
the street to go to yes we for
for a grand jury indictment this
is going to restrict their
ability responsive vers
situations residents as they
need and it's it's going to
create a significant hardship on
us to be able to go to the the
there is a state of New Mexico
to so again we Spanish from
opposition of this.
Thank you.
Thank
you very much my name is chasing
really on the general counsel
for the New Mexico department of
public safety in addition to the
next part of public safety
being over state police were
also the forensic laboratory for
virtually the entire state
besides Albuquerque Bernalillo
county.
We don't have the chemists.
In the DNA analysts.
To send around the state.
To do this work.
We
We would need many many more
people if all of the sudden.
To indict people for trafficking
fitting all you need to send the
chemist who tested the fennel
just to get the case off the
ground.
This isn't a situation in which
mark our side is understand it
at trial if they have to be
present the constitution is with
constitution is and we're not
shying away from that but we're
we're a gigantic state.
Would not enough forensic
scientists and the burden on the
state laboratory criminal
laboratories to send forensic
scientists of all different
stripes all over the state is
one that DPS frankly thanks it
it simply won't be able to meet
and we can worry about that what
that will mean for public safety
throughout the state generally
thank you very much.
Opposition on.
First like first okay yeah our.
Go ahead Daniel.
Yes good good evening madam
chairman committee members can
you hear me.
Yes we can okay again my name is
nongovernmental I'm practicing
attorney for thirty one years
and a prosecutor for twenty four
of those years presently I am
chief deputy district attorney
under do a bar brawl role on the
thirteenth judicial district
attorney's office and on behalf
of the New Mexico District
Attorney Association
respectfully stand in opposition
to house bill one ninety.
First as it pertains to
subsection a and your house bill
one ninety important rules of
evidence shall apply to all the
evidence presented to a grand
jury and allowed District Court
to hear after review the
evidence is extremely
problematic and improper I would
like the committee to read The
New Mexico constitution bill of
rights article two section
fourteen dealing with a grand
jury information and indictments
and rights of the accused more
specifically paragraph two no
we're in this paragraph does it
state that all evidence
presented with a grand jury
shall be lawful and competent
and relevant under the rules of
evidence nor does it state the
District Court may review the
grand jury proceeding the target
notice the indictment and the
relevant competence and
lawfulness of the evidence that
was presented the grand jury to
determine compliance with this
section.
I would secondly invite the
committee to read my drafting of
the DA bill analysis against
this particular bill.
Briefly stating under the
federal in New Mexico
constitutions a grand jury is
not and should not be captive to
any of the three branches of
government subsection a of house
bill one ninety would in fact
allow encroachment upon the sole
province and independent
function of the grand jury.
Secondly by allowing the
District Court to review
evidence presented to a grand
jury under subsection D. of
house bill one one ninety what
again in coach upon the grand
jury's independent function by
allowing the preliminary trial
questioning its decision to
returning true and valid on its
face bill the service right in
the need for the grand jury all
together the US house bill one
ninety subsections a in D. would
effectively ignoring cast aside
decades of federal New Mexico
state K. president of
constitutional interpretation
regarding a grand ritual and
function
I'm sorry your time is up.
Okay just very briefly I of
respectfully
Them against Mr styles saying
that this is it would keep the
privacy and secrecy and this is
a simple matter.
Thank you.
And is there anyone in support
of the bill.
To speak anyone wants to help
you three.
Yes there's.
What.
Okay.
Go ahead you have two minutes.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee my name is Kim
Chavez Cook and I'm speaking on
behalf of the law offices of the
public defender we do support
this legislation I wanted to but
the primary reason is as many
have already stated that right
now there is already a statute
in place that says that the
evidence needs to be a competent
and relevant but there's no
enforcement mechanism for that
at all so if evidence comes in
that does not comply with the
existing statute there's
literally nothing you can do
about that if the grand jury
indicts the indictment stands
and there's no challenging it so
that's one piece of the bill
that I think is just desperately
needed and that's in response to
case law I also think that it's
good policy to require grand
juries find the probable cause
based on admissible evidence the
LFC FIR points out that the
national center for state courts
has found that when prosecution
agencies front load their case
work and are more prepared for
what is coming down the pipe for
trial at this stage in the
proceedings then it can save
resources down the road and in
ensure that prosecutors are not
carrying forward basis that the
leader cannot prove up at trial
so it's a really great way to
weed out weak cases and I do
understand some of the practical
concerns raised by the opponents
but I would point out that the
rules of evidence are already
enforced at preliminary hearings
which is the other primary way
that prosecutors got probable
cause findings and they happen
all the time every day and and
and and it has the the sky has
not fallen this bill would not
require cross examination of
witnesses just that the evidence
they give is admissible at trial
I wanted to quickly as a factual
correction point out that lab
results are almost never
actually complete by the time a
grand jury and so lab analysts
testimony is we're unlikely to
be at issue so I wanted to to
make sure that the committee
knew that as well in response to
one of the opposition comments
thank you and we do ask you to
support this legislation.
Thank you.
You know you have two minutes.
The on the record.
Yes hi good afternoon or evening
I'm Madam chair members of the
committee my name is near record
with the ACLU of New Mexico and
based out of Los crucis and I'm
here to provide both
organizational and personal
support for H. B. one ninety.
Over that ten years ago I was a
state public defender the felony
Division in Albuquerque the case
I'm most proud of was when we
were young indigenous man who's
about twenty years old received
a target letter where he was
falsely accused of a heinous
crime and we were able to beat
at the grand jury stage the
evidence against him was called
free my client did match the
description of the assailant
there was no physical evidence
linking him to the crime but I
knew he would be indicted if he
didn't show up to testify.
And he likely would have been
found innocent at trial but his
life would have been ruined in
the meantime while we're waiting
for this I K. to be disposed it
was the best thing for it to be
have been disposed Act the grand
jury a state.
It's one thing to joke about the
a grand jury indicting a ham
sandwich but it's another when
you or someone you care about
received a target letter and
this bill will bring important
changes to make our system
better for all who are accused
of a crime and I urge to pass
thank you for your time.
Thank you.
Go ahead you have two minutes.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee Rikki Lee Chavez
on behalf of the New Mexico from
defense lawyers association
thank you to the sponsor.
Thanks for.
And.
Still one nine.
Kim Chavez Cook made excellent
points but I wanted to you know
to the committee that NMC stated
complete a report card for this
bill and in state is a coalition
of several organizations and we
review legislation under a
rubric of is it safe is it a
political is it fiscally
responsible and it is evidence
based under that rubric we did
identify that house bill ninety
would be an eight under all of
those and you have supporting
evidence on a report card you
can find all of our report cards
on and in safe dot org thank you
madam chair members of the
committee we are just support
thank you.
Anyone else.
Okay.
I would like to close.
Mr staff I think what I want to
do is let Mr stout make a few
remarks before we go to the
committee.
In response to some of the
opposition Mr seo.
Thank you madam chair
Representative and and members
of the committee
Yes I think that first of all in
this thank you Mr javascript
using the metaphor this guide
following in your the.
Is appropriate because this
guy's not following this is the.
Fairly undramatic Jane E. and
the only explanation that we can
have heard really opposing
instance we don't want to
enforce the present law.
Present a lot of sense.
And it's it's been stated
several times with the present
law requires competent evidence
and the.
Otherwise if we don't protect
our presenters then you're not
following the statute that this
legislature enacted in terms of
laboratory result I think that
defensively rights rarely an
issue and there are rules of
evidence that have exceptions
for lab reports and so forth
that that is a red herring I
believe
this it does not come close to a
preliminary hearing we can argue
about whether or not a
libertarian hearings are better
and I think they are better but
we have to procedures and the
Mexico under this under the
constitution one of the
preliminary hearing the
difference in the other is a
grand jury the difference in the
preliminary hearing the public
proceeding with alcohol with
Witnesses the rules of evidence
supplied crossing them nation of
witness and press you can
subpoena witnesses are you to
judge so forth and so on none of
that is true that a grand jury
so the the the the fact that
this is a secret proceeding.
Makes it even more necessary
that we have LOLS applied for
what what goes on inside the
secret proceed it is a.
Certainly necessary and useful
to have.
They have
some monitoring of this
situation when you have a one
sided receipt it's a one sided
proceeding where the only
official more in the
prosecutors is yes and the
grandeur and so since it is one
sided the unlike a preliminary
hearing then there is it simply
a monitoring thing did you fall
in the statute that's all it is
and the only thing that could
possibly happen is there be a
What is it do over so it's not
like they're somebody's gonna
walk the
so I think it's a very practical
statute or bill and by the way
some of the language in the bill
simply codified.
President rules the only thing
that's really the issue is the
enforcement of this standard of
lawful competent relevant
evidence so
is the comments that the in in
the state and a very good
now since the that the
Justice retired justices that
Chavis and and retired judges
Richard Boston both indoor
system have written a letter in
support of it
retired.
Court appeals chief judge rod
entity supports.
and.
In the sentencing commission
also voted in support of it the
sentencing commission voted last
week to support the bill and so
there's let's support much
analysis and it is a right chest
piece of legislation I would be
happy to answer any questions at
any members that have thank you
madam chair.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you.
Discussion.
Representative yeah thank you.
So the wonderful thing about
having law enforcement in your
phone is that you can ask them
questions and there's and stuff
so a lot of feedback on this I
have this year that's against it
two deputy sheriffs one retired
APD and the statement from Sean
will be who is the present APC.
so I'm no expert when it comes
to grand juries were law that I
have other people that I can
rely on to ask them questions
and some of the things that they
brought up was a lot of time
someone who has some knowledge
of the case yes I have the rest
and also because the response is
not available that's what they
choose rural health is but
basically re read the report in
the land that the grand jury the
bill almost has does have some
good because about the wrong way
as to sits down for a.
Injury also the time limits
which go back to what we heard
so much about the front to
collapse the time limit in the
bill is too short for the rules
of evidence to apply many times
it's almost impossible to get
that much out of the initial
field work for the grand jury
and they'll still be pending DNA
drug results ballistics
interviews etcetera and some of
the stuff takes weeks or months
to get and if they want to
So the place was evident should
be president present in the
defendant wants that they should
ask for your hearing.
And the feedback
I just got from another district
attorney does very much chances.
from Sean will be.
This statement is house bill one
ninety would remove the police
officers ability to testify to
the grand jury any matter
relating to hear say this bill
makes a prosecution and then
only legally competent evidence
this will this bill would make
the rules of evidence apply to
grand jury proceedings currently
the rules of evidence do not
apply the grand jury proceedings
currently District Court has no
jurisdiction to review the
presentation grand jury this
bill would allow the District
Court review the grand jury
proceeding and review the
competency and often this is the
evidence that was presented to
the grand jury finally if the
court deems it is Mr.
Present to the grand jury it
should dismiss the indictment
the state law enforcement should
oppose this bill so I don't have
any more anything on that I just
relied on expert to district
attorneys and sheriffs and law
enforcement that are in the
field the state they all oppose
is beyond of bills thank you
madam chair that's all and.
Representative long.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative.
R. Madam floor leader rather.
And the so.
You know I I guess we just heard
some concerns today from folks
who were at the department of
public safety than state police
under TPS so I just had a
concern I see on my analysis is
a good question would be you
know could criminal defendants
use this new provisions there
Dennis try to get out of a crime
they committed is that could
that happen madam chair Madam
floor leader.
Madam chair representative
block.
I
defendants gonna try to get out
of being indicted or you know
ballot over for trial so I don't
think this changes it
I think what this does turn on
is the presumption of innocence
which is where we start to.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative I just I guess
the.
I just had a question about that
that just popped up to be so
The the this what this bill
would to lead the New Mexico
rules of evidence lying to the
grand jury process is that this
bill we might now since that's
what.
Britain's.
Madam chair representative
locked yes that's that's
certainly my understanding.
But that's going to do is.
Result in a far more certain
decision by the grand jury.
You madam chair thank you madam
for later and so then going back
to the concern that we heard
from the state under the
congressman ministrations
Department of
public safety.
Hey your that there's a huge
fiscal impact this according to
the FIR looks like.
Next year would be three hundred
eighty thousand dollars and that
it would go out for three years
would be like.
Australian so can you can you
just address the you know where
we're going to get this money
and.
It appears to be a burden on the
department give comment on that
Madam chair Madam partly.
Madam chair representative
locked it looks like.
Predominantly the burden is on
the point nine
The
County detention facility or
public defenders or district
attorneys but
they say it's indeterminate so
I I.
Looking at this fiscal year
there and there's no
estimated impact and then I
think it will be determined.
I don't want to speculate but I
do want to give a long answer
but Mr set out to have a really
quick answer about that.
Yes thank you madam chair will
miss or
I think that this actually will
in the long run it will save
money save resources and I don't
have data either of the the idea
is to property of the process so
that strong case to go forward
and we cases do not and the
there will be this will result
in many more cases being
resolved early on.
and by the way K. to go through
with.
Obock our standard you don't
need nearly the evidence this
can be prevented trial or have
all the man was all the million
witnesses if you just have the
problem with the the the money
should be staying in the long
run the the early resolution of
the case.
Madam chair I think that was
what my view on it is is that
you know if we front load the
case the work on the case and it
can either be resolved
to everyone's satisfaction early
in you're not holding up putting
in the system from on that would
ultimately save money I'm
sometimes it is overly
optimistic so I didn't want to
just give that to Representative
block I'm glad that Mr stout.
Kind of confirmed what my
impression is thank you madam
chair thank you Representative
so with that last comment about
it being front loaded with this.
Require the state and all actors
involved would it make them have
stricter time requirements to
get this evidence process and
and whatever else then detailed
there after Representative
actually gets everybody both
sides more time.
Thank you madam chair
representative so you know I I.
If you could give a further on
that tier.
Earlier.
The time would yeah I just I
thought.
And it would not there's not
much time.
Allowed for.
For either type of defendant and
Carceri dependent or it is not
parks right now it just extends
it slightly
This Lauer was saying the
standards really law when you
just only adding a couple of
days to a couple of days hi okay
thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so I guess this I
would I would just the.
Definitely working together with
the state police and the
department of public safety just
because I don't want to be
burned and I certainly wouldn't
want our law enforcers have to
feel like they have some kind of
mandate that they do not need to
Representative so you know I
appreciate the answers and I
just wanna make sure that we're
not discounting this please
ma'am state police you know I
would certainly call it red
herring there that they've sent
to us today I certainly would
not care to residents there
since guys following I think
these are actual administrative
concerns that they have and I
certainly want to consider this
so thank you madam chair and
thank you thank you madam chair
thank you Representative block
thank you.
Senator discussion from the
committee.
Thank you madam chair I just
want to just go on the record
because you know there is this
concern that keeps getting
brought up about the.
Lack of the lack of funding for
all of our courses and the As
and the process and I just want
to shed light on why I think the
grand jury indictment is the
option that's often used at
least in the districts that are
overwhelmed so madam chair
Madam leader if you could just
bring to light where grand
juries are still being utilized
in the state say no it's not
uniform across the state and I
know that they're being chosen
in certain areas and all to just
talk about that a little bit.
Madam chair representative.
The civil settlement
It's my understanding and this
is just what I hear that
Preliminary hearings are fairly
common around the state not so
much to Bernalillo county I'm
not sure about the first and the
third.
Judicial districts Mr stop
practices in the third so
perhaps you could just give a
really quick a picture of of
that judicial district in the
county.
Yes thank you Madam chair
representative of the members of
the the.
Grand jury has traditionally
been practice is to up and down
the Rio Grande quarter or less
three more recently I've been
less used.
Preliminary hearings have been
more used in Albuquerque of
understand recently there's also
a Supreme Court order in Santa
Fe saying that certain cases.
And go to the right Granger and
others cannot in in Los crucis
in the third district it's
almost exclusively ninety nine
percent grand jury which raises
the question why street one
districts have certain rights
under districts not on the east
side it is Stricklin and the
east side of New Mexico are
almost exclusively preliminary
hearings and they've used that.
And and in many many cases with
the with preliminary hearing
using the primary process I
think the sleep over the years.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Bandleader and Michael I really
appreciate that and I think.
When looking at the analysis of
where we're headed you know in
the grand scheme hi I'm remiss
to sort of put more faith in to
protect the grand jury process
given
what we know about where we're
headed and I think the hard part
for me so I am in favor of this
bill holistically and I think
generally we're going is that
we.
Neglected the cost of I think
what we're asking the courts to
do it with numerous times
and and us law enforcement to
prepare for state really
appreciate the extended time
frames madam chair then leader.
You know it just goes back to I
think when we brought up and CCJ
that two percent of our budget
comes to her courts as a as of
the state and I actually thought
it was eleven percent which I
suppose so that was egregious at
that time and I got locked out
of the CCJ because they were
like it's two percent
Representative how dare you
you know we're we're talking
about are you know three
branches of government you know
we need to be able to bring
attention to the fact that when
we make these reforms that we
need to be consistent with how
we.
Also bringing capacity to those
to the rebel so Madam chair
representative
leader and I'm very much looking
forward to it to how this gets
implemented and what we can do
to continue to support our days
and our law enforcement to
prepare
so give me a little heartburn
but overall I think the grand
scheme of getting to preliminary
hearings uniformly having
timelines and what is that we're
trying to accomplish with this
is very much needed and very
much we're where we want to be
as a state but just wanted to be
able to pay some attention to to
what's still lacking very much
so from the capacity so I think
you mentioned.
