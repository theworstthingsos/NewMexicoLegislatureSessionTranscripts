House executive message number
6. Honorable Speaker Martinez
and members of the House,
pursuant to my authority under
Article 4 Section 22 of the New

signed House Bill 5 as amended.
Enacted by the fifty-seventh

Respectfully yours, Michelle
Luhan Grisham, Governor.
Message will be entered.
And a lady from Berlio.
Mr. Speaker, I'm going to go to
the next order of business,
announcements and miscellaneous
business.
Gentle lady from Bernalillo
representative Real Caballero.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise on
a point of personal privilege.
State your point. Thank you.
So to the members of the house,
my colleagues.
I want to first um say thank
you.
To everyone
This session
Starting with the chief clerk.
Going to particularly the office
of the sergeant at Arms.
And all of you who have.
shown kindness, care.
Have actually taken care of me.
In order for me to be able to
move.
Freely and be able to stay here
with you.
During these entire 60 sessions
uh 60 day session.
Although it has been very
challenging.
With the seen and unseen um.
challenges that I have.
It has been an honor.
To serve with you.
And to walk with you along this
journey.
I want to reflect, Mr. Speaker
and my colleagues.
On what I have witnessed and
observed since I've been
elected.
In 2013 I wanna say.
That I came in with the then
largest class.
Of women.
Legislators ever.
In this house
And to those of you.
My fellow women legislators, all
of you.
Minority majority doesn't make a
difference for all women.
When I came, we did not have a
women's restroom in the lounge.
We were given keys to use.
The private restroom in the
Senate.
Women's area.
Just think of that 2013.
We did not have a restroom in
the lounge.
That year we witnessed the
construction.
Of
The restroom
But only because.
We made a statement that the,
the women in that class made a
very strong statement.
About accessibility.
More than anything.
We were not going to be unseen
in this house.
That's my first observation.
The other observation that I've
witnessed and it's been an
absolute pleasure to witness.
Is that that was the I think
that was the year that we gave
and held the first baby shower.
In this house.
For representative Andres
Romero.
We were able to witness.
He and his wife welcome their
first son.
And they had, there had never
been a baby shower.
Held in the house.
That was the first year.
That we ever had a baby shower
and.
The women in the house led by
myself organized that baby
shower.
And we witnessed and welcomed
his first born.
That was an absolute pleasure
for all of us.
I also want to mention.
The representative Andres Romero
led the charge.
On
Having baby change stations.
In the men's restroom.
Because he was a father.
But not only that, this was
what, 2014?
Oh, I can't remember 15 2015.
2015 we did not have changing
stations.
Representative.
Andres Romero led that bill
sponsored that bill and we
passed it.
I say all of this because.
We look around today.
And we see the majority of us
are women in this house.
And it's to be noted that the
women in this house, they, yes,
yes, please, it's my moment of
personal privilege, but I
welcome you to clap.
And applaud
But it was because of us.
That these changes.
Were made possible.
But we stood arm in arm, hand in
hand with our brothers.
Because without
Our brothers without the men in
this house.
We would not be made whole.
And that's what I say in my life
as you witness my husband with
me.
This is our 40th year we will
celebrate our anniversary this
year.
He has not left my side.
And I want to acknowledge him in
this moment as well and all the
spouses, partners, significant
others in the lives in our lives
that make our being here
possible.
And we cannot take these moments
for granted ever.
We must give thanks every single
day, every moment yesterday we
welcomed the Equinox.
The Equinox brings our life in
balance.
It reminds us that we must
balance everything that we do in
our lives beginning with our
personal lives.
But our personal lives are
woven into what we do.
In our public service.
So I just wanted us to leave.
On the note of the importance of
being grounded.
Being balanced.
And being grateful above all.
For each other grateful every
single day that we are given.
We must be grateful and give
thanks.
And that's why I started that.
This
This morning I wanna give thanks
to all of you for making my
service possible these 60 days.
Thank you
Mucha gracias a todos los quiero
de maciado. I love you all very
much. Thank you and have a
wonderful post-legislative
session, have a wonderful
interim session.
And let's
Get back to work ready to work
using.
Our voices to represent.
Those that do not have voices.
Those that are not represented
or do not feel represented, let
us make them feel represented
with our presence. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker for allowing me this
moment of personal privilege.

Gentlemen from Donana, are you
ready on item number 34? I am
Mr. Speaker. Can you get me to
that point that all action
necessary for replacing Senate
Finance Committee substitute for
Senate Bill 376 on final passage
has been taken and it is subject
to debate amendment or
substitution. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Senate Finance
Committee substitute for Senate
Bill 376 amends the contribution
for state employee health
benefits, uh, and improves our
coverage for state employees.
There is a bit lady from Donana
Sierras of Cordo, Representative
Doo.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the
gentlemen yield, Mr. Speaker, I
gladly yield to the gentle lady
from Donana Sierra and Socorro.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentlemen. Can you explain
to me where these funds are
coming from and what they will
be covering.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, gentle lady. Uh, some
of the funds, uh, for this, uh,
um, program, uh, first they're
going to cover state employees.
Right now we have the worst, uh,
state employee health coverage
of regional states, uh, so we're
going to increase the coverage
for state employees. Also, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, expand
coverage for National Guard, uh,
service people here in the
state, particularly some of the
younger folks who are serving in
dangerous, uh, uh, tasks and
and don't have health insurance.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, some
of the funds in addition to
general fund contributions that
we're making, uh, some of the
funds will come from the
Healthcare Affordability Fund.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, and
are those funds in the in the
healthcare affordability fund,
is that in char, does that
include the surcharge that we,
uh, apply to small businesses
and folks on the private market
in New Mexico. Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, the Healthcare
Affordability Fund is funded by
that uh surcharge, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, that surcharge, the
majority of the, uh, I don't
know if the majority but a very
significant portion of the
funding actually comes from uh a
surcharge.
Uh, on Medicaid premiums, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, uh, but
it's also charged on other, uh,
others as well. Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, and when you say
it's, it's charged on Medicaid.
Do you mean the folks in the
private market that choose to be
in the exchange, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, uh, no, the
Medicaid, uh, this, uh, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, for folks
who are receiving Medicaid
coverage, uh, the, uh, surcharge
which then is paid federal
uh, is a significant source of
funding for the healthcare
affordability fund. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker and thank you
gentlemen. How much does that,
how, how many states, I think I
know the answer, whenever the
federal government eliminated
the surcharge on the premium on
a private market premiums.
How many states chose to keep
that tax and continue it
imposing it on the on the uh
private market businesses Mr.
Speaker, John lady, back in
2021, I believe it was, uh,
which is the source of this
funding, so not in this bill,
but source of the funding, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I believe
there's, uh, 4 other states,
maybe 5 other states. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker and thank you,
gentlemen. So out of the 50
states, 5, if you include New
Mexico, chose not to pass that.
savings onto the private uh
insurance providers and that
surcharge continued in New
Mexico and Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, I heard in um
committee because we heard this
in appropriations that we're
using that money to give a 10%
discount on that private market.
We, we, we went past it. We told
the citizens that we would keep
that tax and impose it on them
because we would reduce their
premiums as the private market.
And I understand that we're
giving him a 10% discount on
their premiums. So what is the
average
cost for these small businesses,
individual and in group whenever
they are getting that 10%
discount.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, Jolene, I'll,
let me introduce my experts. We
have Colin Bilo and uh Deputy
Secretary Alex Castillo Smith
both from the Healthcare
Authority. I'll consult with
them really quickly.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, generally, I
don't have the exact uh
premiums, but Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, the support through
the Healthcare Affordability
Fund, which is covering roughly
50,000 employees of small
businesses here in New Mexico as
well as supporting those folks
on the exchange, um, is keeping
those costs on trend with other
states in the country, I'm told.
Thank, thank you, Mr. Speaker
and thank you gentlemen. But I
guess if I could just put that
into percentages. We're giving
the small businesses who are
actually generating the
surcharge, those independent
people who are on the private
market, we're giving him a 10%
discount on their premium. What
percent of the discount are we
going to take from the surcharge
that's charged to this private
market that are getting 10%. And
how much are we going to give a
discount to the state employees.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
the, um, we're, we're going to
an 80% uh employer 20% employee
coverage model for the state,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, in
large part uh driven by
increases in state employee
salaries that have taken them
into higher income tiers and put
them into higher employee
contributions. Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, also I just wanna
emphasize for the
body that uh a significant
portion of the healthcare
affordability fund comes from a
surcharge on Medicaid policies,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, and so
I think it's, well some of that
is on the private market, a very
significant portion comes from,
uh, uh, the federal government
as a surcharge on Medicaid
policies. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker, and thank you
gentlemen. And so what is the
premium increase that
We're going to realize in the
state of New Mexico with all
these expansions and the things
that we're doing, I've heard
it's about a 30% increase in the
premiums. Is that, is that
correct, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen? Um
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady. uh, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I'm told
without this bill, we would be
charging on average 30%
increased premium charges to
keep up with costs with the
bill, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
we're looking in the 20% range
and getting that into a more
manageable number. Speaker and
thank you gentlemen, and I've
heard a lot of the reference to
um
That we are, we have, we have
the highest surcharge in the
nation, is that correct?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
I'm not we're not sure about
that. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
thank you gentlemen, but one of
the other things that we also
have that, that we are very
proud of is our retirement
program. Is that correct, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen?
Mer gentle lady in speaking sort
of about the state employee
benefits, certainly tirement is
a retirement is a part of that.
But Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
healthcare costs and insurance
costs are an increasing
challenge for, for all of us,
and Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
um, this is one way to better
manage those costs to make it
easier, uh, for instance, for
New Mexicans to serve in the
National Guard, um, and Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, that's why
we're bringing the bill also.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, to uh
get our cost down because in the
past we've been providing very
significant non-recurring
general fund, uh, infusions to
cover gaps, uh, and shortfalls,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, on the
order of 100+ million dollars
annually the last couple of
years. The Senate Bill 376 will
remove, we will no longer have
to do that, Mr. Speaker, and
thank you gentlemen, and I, you
know, you do have your expert
witness there and obviously the
the fix to having to use the
revert, you know, to fill that
gap is definitely appreciated.
Um, next year when we expand
this, this doesn't cover all
state employees. So when we
expand this yet next year, won't
we be in the arrears again and
where do you expect to get those
dollars? I mean, I know we're
talking in the future, but I'm
just saying like,
We continue to tax our
businesses. We continue to apply
surcharges here, surcharges
there, and we're doing this in a
year when we had a $3 billion or
28 $2.85 billion on top of what
we had before, and I think about
the squeeze that we're putting
on all the folks that are
working so hard. If we realized
inflation, they realized
inflation. If, if, uh, if the
state's premiums went up, then
the private insurance premiums
go up. If the cost
To ensure your business goes up,
uh, for the state liability
insurance, healthcare. I mean,
we, we are building that into
our state budget, but in this
case, we're doing it on a
promise that we made to make
healthcare affordable for small
business. But Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, let me just, let me
just ask this. How much, because
of course, all of us appreciate
and support our National Guard
and our state employees. That's,
that's not in question. What I'm
struggling with is that we have
grown the size of government and
we're growing new programs
before we show.
the others. And so what do um
National Guard, what is an
individual in the National Guard
pay right now for their
insurance if it's a single
person, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, I'm told that under the
current reserve plan, it's $53 a
month.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank
you, gentlemen. I would
encourage the body to think
about what they pay for an
insurance premium and $58 a
month is a very, very nice
benefit. Free is better, but,
but when you have to take from
someone else to give, um, and
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, what
is it for a family in National
Guard right now?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
I'm told that it's a little over
$200.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and
thank you, gentlemen, and
that's, that's, that's a very,
they earn it, they deserve it.
We are grateful for them and
that's good. And to lower the
cost of that premium comes at a,
at a, at a cost of, of someone
else whose premium is going to
go up. What's going to happen to
small business insurance? Are
they also going to see increases
in their premiums?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
uh, I'm pleased to report that
we're providing increased
assistance to the small
businesses who who utilize this,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, and up
to reducing the premiums
approximately 15%. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker, and thank you,
gentlemen. So what will it cost
for an individual that gets the
same offering and benefit from
the healthcare affordability on
the exchange and what would it
be for a family and one of these
small businesses.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
those would depend upon the plan
and the income of that person,
Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies, but
I, I think probably the best
place is just to focus on that
15% reduction. So we, it, it, a
lot of variables but a 15%
reduction, 5% more, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady than last year. So
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, if I
understand correctly, they're
probably gonna start in the mid
500s and if they add a family,
they'll probably be, you know,
I, I, I think
OK
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
again, there's a lot of
variables there. One thing I can
report from my expert is that on
the exchange, uh, 50% of folks
are getting a plan for
$10 or less per month in large
part, Mr. Speaker, General Lady,
thanks to the Healthcare
Affordability Fund. Uh, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, I, I do
appreciate that, um, that's, I
don't think that's the average
cost, but I do appreciate that.
I think, you know, I'm so glad
that we've been afforded the
opportunity to give raises and
to give benefits to state
employees, to the counties, to
the local political subdivisions
and it's awesome that we're
doing that.
It's unfortunate that we're
doing it by more taxes, more
surcharges, more, and, and this
only makes a solvent on this
plan. So next, when we come back
to work on the budget in the 30
day session, we're gonna have to
find more money. Is that
correct?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
uh, within this area, one of the
requirements in Senate Bill 376
is to submit actuarly sound
plans every single year that
requirement has not been in
place before, so, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, I think regardless,
we're going to have a much
clearer understanding, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, uh, I do
want to note that in committee,
uh, perhaps here on the floor
today, there, I think there's a
lot of interest in expanding,
uh, including for.
are, uh, educators. And so Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, when we
think about and acknowledge
something like that, I think
that would uh require additional
funding, but Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, the addition of new
funding, the new plans that are
being offered and the new
choices being offered. I think
very much do help to cover and
control costs much better than
it has in the past.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, and I
mean, I'm, I think.
I think
You understand where my heart's
coming from, and the fact that
we've had to take 45.6 million
from the general fund, bring in
22.5 million from, from other
funds, 13.4 million from federal
funds. Now 12.1 million from the
Affordable Care uh from the
Healthcare Affordability Fund
and this is just the start of
where we wanna go. I, I'm not, I
was not part of the framework
for this budget. I was elected
in November and I'm, I'm very,
um impressed with the staff and
impressed with the
appropriations committee and the
work that we're doing, and Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, when I do
get to have a say, I will
continue to advocate that we not
do these things on the backs of,
of more taxes and more
surcharges and more squeeze on
small business or let me put it
another way, not passing these
benefits and savings on that
they are contributing as
taxpayers, as small businesses,
as the payer of GRT as the
people
generating the money that we are
choosing to spend that we pass
these on. It feels like a plane
that's about to crash. We are so
bloated, um, in 16, my first
time as a freshman, our budget
was $6 billion. We are now at
$11 billion and still having to
tax people, put more imposition
on people and impose more on our
small businesses and those that
are producing for us to fund all
the growth of government, and
it's like a plane and you're
supposed to put the oxygen on
your own face first before you
help others. We all want to help
others, but we've got to be
responsible and, and care for
the people that are generating
the dollars that we so
benevolently spend on behalf of
others. And so I, I mean, we,
we've got to level out this
growth of government and, and
when you have a $3 billion
surplus, the need to impose
surcharges and the need to take
this from the place that's
beneficiaries that we promised.
It's just a hard pill to
swallow, so I hope that we
find a better way to do this
than growing government. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you,
gentlemen. Thank you, gentle.
Next, uh, we have, uh,
representative, uh, from
Valencia, Representative Mirabal
Moya.
Thank you Madam Speaker. Well,
the gentleman, um, from Donana
Yield Mr. Madam Speaker, I
gladly yield to the gentle lady
from Valencia.
Uh, thank you, Madam Speaker and
gentlemen, um, can you tell me
specifically which state
employees are getting this um
80/20 benefit.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
uh, the employees of executive
agencies, legislative agencies,
uh, the National Guard.
And and the judicial uh
employees, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
Um, thank you, uh, Mr. Speaker,
and, um, and gentlemen, um, so
The, the, the numbers that you
gave um to um um the other
representative, um, for the
National Guard and, and are
those premiums that will be at
the 80/20 or those current
premiums that they're paying.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, in
that case for our National Guard
members, the full premium will
be covered.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, which
it should, uh, now, what is the
premium uh uh a normal premium
for any of the other state
employees that we're now going
to 2. What is, what is that
average premium?
Uh, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, gentle lady. I'm told
that the average premium is
about $675.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, is that
per month or per paycheck?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
that one is per month.
Thank you Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen. Um, so, so what
bothers me is that educators
aren't included in this, and um
and I know that um I, I hear the
cries from my uh personally, I
don't have skin in the game
because I have a husband that,
that has great insurance
coverage and I don't have to,
thank God, uh, because I know
several educators where that 6
to 700 is coming per paycheck
out of their paychecks, and that
is
Ridiculous, um, and, and, and
luckily, thankfully, we, we are
in, in the last several years we
have raised their their their
pay but often raising their pay
raises their insurance costs and
they seem minimal when it comes
to that. So it really
disappoints me not seeing
because I know there was a bill
out there that um that had um
educators getting 80/20 also,
um, it, it just disappoints me
that we're, we're only, we're
picking and choosing the
branches that we're choosing to
help and our.
Educators have to wait for it.
Thank you.

a necessary for placing Senate
Bill 343 on final passage has
been taken and it is subject to
debate, amendment, or
substitution generally to
explain the bill.
Mr. Speaker, Senate Bill 343 is
teacher salary rate changes. It
ensures that vocational or CTE
teachers all received the
minimum salaries, uh.
That teachers in New Mexico are
entitled to and with that, I
send for questions.
There is to be gentlemen from
Otero representative block.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, with my
friend from Bernalillo briefly
please yield.
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the
gentleman from from Otero. Thank
you so much, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, just a couple of quick
questions on this one. so what
are they currently make and what
would it change it to? What
would the bracket be changed to?
Mr. Speaker, and kind gentleman
actually many of the vocational
teachers already make above the
minimums, but there are some
districts and schools that
haven't enacted that this
mandates that they have to do
the minimum salaries at least.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. And is this kind of
a bill to help bring more CTE
folks into schools so that we
can help get these people
because I know it's very hard to
get them because they're getting
a really good salary in the
private sector. I'm just
wondering, is that the purpose?
Uh, Mr. Speaker and kind
gentlemen, the main purpose is
to ensure that they are
guaranteed the minimums, but it
can reassure them that they will
get that much money, if not
more.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That's
all I had. I appreciate the
answers.

Mr. Speaker, apologies. Let the
record reflect that a deserved
for place in Senate Bill 201 as
amended on final passage has

Gentle lady from Berlio
Representative Herndon, are you
ready on item 37. Yes, I am, Mr.
Speaker. Will you take me to
that point? Let the record
reflect that all action is
necessary for place in 88 as
rice amended on final passage
has been taken, and it is
subject to debate, amendment, or
substitution. The gentil lady to
explain the bill. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Senate Bill 88 is
thrice amended creates the
Medicaid Trust Fund and the
state supported Medicaid fund
and requires certain balances of
reverting funds and accounts to
be transferred from the general.
fun to the Medicaid Trust Fund.
With that, Mr. Speaker, I stand

FYI.
The vote is now closed by a vote
of 15 in the affirmative, 13 in
the negative. Senate Bill 88 is
3 times amended as duly passed
this house.
The lady from Berlio or Parajo?
Are you ready? and item number
45.
Speaker, can you get me to that
point that all action necessary
for placingen bill 16 is twice
amended on final passage has
been taken.
And it is subject to debate
amendment or substitution, the
general lady to explain the
bill.
Mr. Speaker, SB 16 allows
330,000 declined to state or
unaffiliated voters to
participate in public primary
elections without jumping
through the hoops of same day
party registration. So on
primary election day, such a
voter can request a ballot from
one of the parties holding a
primary.
So essentially what this bill
does, it relieves the
unnecessary burden on our county
clerks. What this bill does not
do, Mr. Speaker. Dems who vote
in Dem Dems will continue to
vote in Democratic primaries.
Republicans will continue to
vote in Republican primaries and
minor parties do not get to
choose a ballot.
This does not allow a voter
registered with any party to
choose another person's ballot.
Also, it does not prevent
parties from holding their own
private elections with their own
funding. Mr. Speaker, I have two
experts with me today, Sola
Absil and uh Lindsay Bachmann
from the Secretary of State's
office.
Seeing no debate. Just kidding.
Gentlemen from Sando Island,
Santa Fe Representative McQueen.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, this
gentle lady yield?
I yield to my friend from
Sandoval and Santa Fe.
Mr. Speaker, generally, is it
true that under current law,
A TTS voter can show up on
election day.
Uh, use the, uh, CD registration
tool, uh, statute.
And vote in a major party's
primary election. Is that true?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, yes,
as I explained in my intro, it
is true, but those unaffiliated
voters have to re-register with
the Secretary of State's office.
That means they need to provide
their voter ID. They need to
provide information. The
Secretary of State must then
collaborate that information
that they have with vital
statistic records and as we saw
in the last election, sometimes
this can take um for some folks
up to 2 hours.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um,
So, so we already have a
provision where DTS voters can
vote, uh, and you've described
it as a burden for them to use
the same day voter registration,
uh, technique which other voters
would have to do other eligible
voters. Um, Mr. Speaker,
generally, do you know how many
voters, uh, used that in the
last election, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, only 1% use that in
the primary elections.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, do you
know 1% how many voters does
that translate to?
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
that's a moment in time number
so the Secretary of State isn't
able to give an exact amount.
So Mr. Speaker, generally
you're, but you're telling us
that it's a burden on the county
clerks and you don't know the,
the level of the burden.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, we do
know the level of burden, um,
because people have had this
experience in registering to
vote.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I'm
talking about the, the number of
people, the, the level of the
burn on the clerk. So an
individual, it might take them a
little longer to vote.
But I'm unclear on
How much paperwork the clerks
Mr. Speaker, and a gentlemen, so
we know that there are about
330,000 declined to say voters,
so we imagine that in that
primary the 1% we're talking
about 3000 voters or so who are
having to reregister on that
day, uh, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, but you know, the,
the main issue here is that a
lot, first of all, a lot of
folks don't realize that they're
uh registered as unaffiliated
especially folks who are first
going to vote, so this is is
certainly and it, it, yes.
it, it is a little bit more time
but that little bit more time
has proven in the past election
to be up to 2 hours. So Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, um, I
would say that that is a, a
nonsignificant amount of time to
be waiting.
Um
Mr. Speaker, generally,
non-significant. Not
insignificant.
Thank you for that
clarification, Mr. Speaker.
General Lee, so if a voter
doesn't know that they're not
registered.
They're going to have to
register anyway, aren't they? I
mean, this doesn't actually
change that.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
they are registered, but they
don't know that they are not
that they are not registered
with a party, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, um, if they, this
bill would provide two options.
Either one, they could register
with the party, which is the
current system, or they could
also um just vote choose the the
ballot in which they wish to
affiliate that day, uh, as a
Republican or a Democrat, only
the major parties.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, uh, I
maybe you could clarify for me,
do we only have two major
parties? I thought the
libertarians were still a major
party.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, the
Secretary of State says that um
notifies me that the uh the
libertarians are still under
review, so it would be as
current Republican or Democrat.
So Mr. Speaker, generally, do
you think
Your bill would result in large
shifts in the electorate in the
primary elections from year to
year.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
well that is certainly a
question that has been posited
in multiple academic journals
and reviews they haven't really
seen that, uh, but Mr. Speaker
and gentlemen, what I can tell
you is that uh the Pew Center
says that independence are
pretty much split down the
middle in terms of where they
lean. So Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, uh, we believe that
the independents who are in for
instance a majority democratic
district or a majority
Republican district are going to
lean in the way that they're.
uh members are voting. What we
are trying to do with this bill,
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, is to
increase the number of folks who
turn out for primaries.
So, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
um,
With in the shift, would you
have, uh, independence DTS
voters, uh, who were say, very
conservative voting in
Democratic primaries and those
that were very liberal or
progressive voting in Republican
primaries.
Mr. Speaker and uh gentlemen,
um, I, you know what, what a
person would have to do if they
were Republican, um, and they
wanted to vote in this type of
election is 28 days before the
election, they would have to
become declined to stay and then
they would have to then go and
choose a democratic um ballot.
So Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
that would require a lot of
coordination in order to swing
the electorate, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, we, um, we really
haven't seen that and I'll
find the body that um many other
states we are only one of 10
states that has closed
primaries. Many other states
have semi-open primaries or
fully open primaries, uh, and
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, what
we are asking for today is not
open primaries, um, but a form
of, of semi-open kind.
Mr. Speaker, generally, thank
you for that, but that, that
wasn't my question. My question
wasn't about Republicans and
Democrats voting in the one
another's primaries. My question
was about DTS voters.
So if you're a DTS voter and say
you're super conservative, would
you not be eligible to vote in a
Democratic primary and if you
were a DTS voter and you were
super liberal, would you not be
able to vote in a Republican
primary, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, yes.
And
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, don't
you think in a given election,
you could see huge swings in
voters.
From one primary to another, and
Mr. Speaker lady, I'll give you
an example in 2018.
In the Republican primary in
2018.
Not a single statewide race was
contested.
Not one, not Governor, not any
of the other statewide offices.
So if you're a DTS voter, and
you go to vote on primary day,
you know, whether you're liberal
or conservative.
You probably wouldn't bother
voting in the Republican primary
because it doesn't give you any
options. You would probably vote
in the Democratic primary, don't
you think?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
certainly, but they could do
that today and they, we don't
really see that happening, um,
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, I
would argue, um, you know,
someone who is conservative like
that, um, yeah, they, they could
still do it today if they really
if they really want to do that,
or it may be happening.
So, Mr. Speaker, generally, but
you're talking about trying to
make it easier, so I think that
shift within end up being
bigger, and Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, I'm not criticizing the
Republicans, you know, I'm just
using that as an example, Mr.
Speaker, generally, what I think
will happen is I, I think the
election turnout is largely
driven by the top of the ticket.
Um, I don't, I don't think
people show up to vote for state
representative. I, you know, I
think they vote while they're
there, but I think for the most
part they're usually focusing on
President or governor.
And Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, we
often have a situation where one
party has
You know, a close election.
And the other party doesn't.
So in in in 2020, for example,
and probably in 2024 in the
presidential elections, you
know, the, the candidate or
2020, the candidate, you know,
the Republican nominee was, was
President Trump.
So, you know, not a lot of
action going on there. So in
that case, when a lot of
conservative voters.
Drift over to the Democratic
primary and try to influence
that primary, even though
They had no intention of
ultimately voting for the winner
of that primary.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, it's
certainly, um, a possibility,
but Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, I
think in those districts that
would already be happening
because this, this, um, our
current law which allows for
same day registration does allow
someone to do that.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen. So,
but Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, if
it's already happening, then we
probably don't need your bill.
Because they can already do
that.
So
Well, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
what this bill does is it what
we've seen in other states such
as Colorado that has a semi-open
primary is it does increase the
number of voters who do come
out. It didn't show in Colorado
that there are big swings or
that there were large changes in
the electorate, um, of the kind
that you're talking about which
is formerly known as party
rating in literature and Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, um, I
think what we want from this
bill is that we would have more
participation in those
primaries. We'd have more people
coming out.
More people, um, yes, if they
did choose a um a uh the
Democratic ticket or they chose
the Republican ticket, they
would be choosing to affiliate
with that ticket.
So, um, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, you know, I
Uh
Uh
I, I don't think Colorado is a
good comparison. Um, they have a
larger population than we do.
Um
Uh, maybe not by a lot. Um, I,
I, I think what you're gonna see
if this passes, is in any given
year, it's gonna be really
unpredictable, you know, where
this large group of DTS voters
will end up voting. You know, I
think it really just opens the
door to strategic voting.
Yeah, I think that's important
because in my mind, a primary is
a primary. It's a chance for
Democrats to pick their
candidate as a chance for
Republicans to pick their
candidate. It's a chance for
libertarians to pick their
candidate and we're
Um, we're, uh, muddying up that
picture.
Um
So Mr. Speaker, generally, one
more question. Um, do you, do
you think your bill is
constitutional?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, yes.
So, Mr. Speaker, generally, I
know you're in law school and,
um, I remember in law school,
the joke was the only job you're
qualified for when you graduate
is to be a justice on the
Supreme Court, uh, because we
spent so much time reading
Supreme Court cases. Uh, have
you looked at uh California
Democratic Party versus Jones,
Secretary of State of
California, a 20 2000 Supreme
Court case. Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, yes, I have it right
here in front of me.
And Mr. Speaker, generally, do
you think this, this case casts
doubt on the ability to have the
state forcibly quote unquote
open the primary.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, uh,
that case was about a different
kind of primary system than the
kind that we are proposing, but
what is your, what, what do you
believe about that case, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen. Speaker,
I believe the case touches on
the constitutional First
Amendment rights, which include
freedom of association.
And if, if
The Democratic Party or
Republican Party chooses to
associate with Democrats or
Republicans, uh, respectively,
uh, the state is now telling
them that under your bill, you
have to allow people who are not
members of that party to
participate in your primary.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um, a
few points on that. First of
all, parties are still allowed
to.
have their own primary, a closed
primary if they wish, for
instance, in a forum or at a
convention, um, and second of
all, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
I believe that that case is
really about um the the issue
that they had with that primary
system and why they're ruling in
that way, uh, in the context of
that case is that the form that
California had allowed folks who
were not affiliated with a party
voting or affiliated with.
party affiliated for instance in
a Republican primary voting.
In a democratic primary, so Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, I believe
there's a distinction there
between folks there, it is
constitutional to have folks who
are affiliating with the party,
choosing to affiliate with the
party, um, for instance, there's
uh another case that we could
talk about which is um the.
The Colorado Republican Party
versus Griswold, that one came
out in 2020 or the Democratic
Party versus Nago, which
essentially says that as long as
you don't have Republicans
voting in the in the Democratic
primary, um, or vice versa if
the if the person is
unaffiliated, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, um, then they can
choose to, uh, they have to
choose to affiliate with the
party. And Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, that's what we're
proposing here in this bill that
you can choose one ballot,
Republican.
Ballot or a democratic ballot.
And Mr. Speaker, generally,
typically when you choose to
affiliate with the party, does
that mean you're registering
with that party?
Uh, well, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, I think in the Hawaii
case we see that um enough just
the fact the act of choosing the
ballot, um, is proof enough of
affiliation.
So, Mr. Speaker, uh, gentle
lady, you know, I'll just close.
In saying that I think this is a
bad idea.
Uh, I think you're gonna have
big shifts, uh, I think it's
gonna be really unpredictable.
Uh, I think, uh, the, you,
you're gonna.
In a lot of chaos into the
primaries, and I think that's a
bad idea. I also personally
believe it's on shaky legal
ground. Uh, I understand that
you could, you know, draw a
distinction on some of the
finer points of the primary
system, but I, I think, I think
it's shaky. So, um, thank you,
Mr. Speaker. Thank you, gentle
lady.
Thank you, gentlemen. Let's go
next to the gentleman from
Montero, Representative Block.
Hello, Mr. Speaker. Good
afternoon. Good afternoon. Would
the gentle lady from the
beautiful county of Bernalillo,
please yield. I don't know how
beautiful it is, but it's a
county not as beautiful as it's
really, really beautiful,
Mr. Speaker, um, I yield to my
friend from Montero.
Thank you and I, yes, it is a
beautiful county as, as are all
of our counties because we have
one of the most beautiful states
or the most beautiful state, in
my opinion, in the union, but
this bill is not necessarily
about how beautiful we are. It's
about the makeup of our
electorate. So,
Mr. Speaker, so.
I have some concerns, but I'm
not going to talk about my
concerns during this debate.
Instead, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, I actually am, I'm now on
the fence again on this bill. I
keep on jumping off the fence
and on the fence on this bill.
And I think it actually might
Potentially benefit
My party in this state.
So Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, the
way I see it.
In districts that are really
tight in Albuquerque that we've
lost in many election cycles.
I could see the potential for
independent voters who do not
like either party.
Getting radicalized, so to
speak, by either side to vote
for the Republican candidate or
the Democratic candidate in
certain races.
So Mr. Speaker, General lady,
this, you know, we're, we're
trying to target this to let
more people vote and like the
gentleman from Sandoval and
Santa Fe said earlier, we might
a lot of these people are super
hardcore right wing, super
hardcore. They don't even like
the party or Republican Party
because we're not right wing
enough.
And so I believe that those
people could be galvanized to
find the most right-wing
candidates and vote for those
most right-wing candidates in
the primary. Do you think that
could happen in the state of New
Mexico and maybe even flip some
of these seats in Albuquerque
for the Republican Party.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, do
you know Bernie Sanders, the
senator?
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I
don't believe he lives in the
city of New Mexico.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, no,
he does not, but he is a senator
and he is an independent and he
is um probably according to you
very, very left. Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, um, couldn't the same
be said for the very, very left
independence.
It could, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, but our state is a blue
leaning state. It is not a state
like Bernie Sanders, which is
far left blue. I think it's kind
of like a murky blue, maybe.
It's not like a deep, deep blue.
So I think that point is very
interesting, but in our state
where we do have these very
tight districts, this actually
could benefit the Republican
Party in some of those district
districts, wouldn't you think
that, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, I
don't really see that happening
in other states.
uh, I think the mix of of states
that have semi-open primaries
are very diverse. I mean
Colorado, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, um,
What we've seen is that that
doesn't really happen. In fact,
most states have completely open
primaries where, uh, you just
get a ballot and you pick who
you want to pick, uh, there's no
affiliation, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, we are one of 10
states that has closed primary
systems.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, General
lady, and I think that's
interesting, but I also
I know that there are different
kinds of open primaries, some
are semi-open like California
has a jungle primary where
everybody runs on the same
ticket, all the Republicans, all
the Democrats run, but, but the
parties kind of already choose
their candidate. And so Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, when
you're talking about these
parties having their own
conventions that are closed.
Don't you think that actually
would
get the most right wing and the
most left-wing people elected as
the people of our our House and
Senate.
As the nominees because only the
party insiders would be the ones
to choose that person.
Mr. Speaker and Representative,
can you rephrase that question?
Sure, Mr. Speaker, generally, so
in an answer for the gentleman
from Santa Fe and Sandoval, I
believe what I heard was
These parties can still hold
their own primaries that are
closed. They can do it at a
convention, and they might just
do that. And in that case, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, wouldn't
that mean that we're choosing, I
mean, I know the party insiders
and the Republican and the
Democratic parties are very
hardcore to the cause for their
party. So those individuals
would probably find the most
hardcore right, hardcore left
people to run their party.
Wouldn't you agree?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, that.
That is a scenario, I suppose,
but Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
in the states that have
semi-open primaries, they are
conducting these public
primaries, so to speak. They're
using state dollars to have most
people elected. So Mr. Speaker
and gentlemen, while it, it's
certainly an option, uh, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, and what
we see from other states is that
they continue to use the primary
system.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Generally, can you tell me which
state specifically has the exact
same framework that we're trying
to enact today.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, so,
um, this type of framework is
known as open to unaffiliated
voters or semi-open primaries,
Arizona, Colorado, Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
North Carolina, Rhode Island.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. So are you, are we saying
Arizona, Colorado,
Massachusetts, is that North
Carolina. My, my handwriting is
horrible and then Rhode Island,
they have exactly the same
framework as we're putting
forward today.
Mr. Speaker, yes. OK, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, so then.
I would also think that this
could do another thing that
might.
Be interesting for the parties
because if I was a
Let's just say I was not elected
and I was a Republican in
Albuquerque and my
Person who was my representative
was a Democrat who I thought was
very progressive.
Could I then
Switch
To be an independent DTS.
And then try to elect the most
moderate.
Democrat
in the Democratic primary and
potentially take out some
farther left or less moderate
individual because me as a
former as this person would be a
former Republican going to be
DTS they could influence the
Democratic primary to get the
most moderate individual in that
seat. Couldn't that happen with
this process, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, uh, uh, you can
actually do that today if you,
if you were interested in that.
Mr. Speaker, generally, but I
hear that it's such a burdensome
process like we said, it takes 2
hours, right?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, what
we see is that this strategic
voting, the party rating that it
happens more in closed primary
systems, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, I mean, if you really
wanted to do that, you could
change your registration, um, to
be democratic, but Mr. Speaker
and gentlemen, uh, what we, what
we see here is, is really the
point of this bill is to really
open um to have a better
democratic republic to really
increase participation in our in
our primary voting system.
Um, 60% of which most districts
in this state are decided by
that single primary, Mr. Speaker
and gentlemen, um, independences
are all over the place and the
Pew Research Center says that um
at least in the last year 17% of
independence lean Democratic,
13% leaned Republican. Now
Republican independents who lean
that way or independents who
lean more Republican, they turn
out more to vote. Mr. Speaker
and gentlemen, it's really a
wash.
is what we see um with this folk
with this group of course
there's always the fringe
scenarios, but Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, what this bill would
do would allow for more folks to
vote in the primaries.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and then do we know in
these states that we've put
forward these bills, when did
they begin to implement these
policies in Arizona, Colorado,
Massachusetts, Newton, North
Carolina, and Rhode Island. When
was the timeline on those dates.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
the, the most, most of the
states have had this since their
founding. Um, so, you know, when
we founded our states, we
decided the Constitution, the
state legislatures decide the
laws, so for instance, states
like Hawaii, Texas, um,
Virginia, North Dakota, they
have completely open primaries,
um, states like Arizona,
Colorado, and Maine have updated
their um their systems to, uh,
follow.
semi-open primaries.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and then can you
tell me, do you know if the
state of Washington has open
primaries.
Or semi-open or however we're
defining it today. Uh yeah, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, no, they
do not have open primaries. They
have top two, top 2 primary
system, which is very similar to
California's where, um, everyone
runs on the same ballot. There's
no party affiliation. The top
two advanced to the general
regardless of Democrat or
Republican.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. That's interesting.
OK, cause I, I think that state
is one of the most far left
states in the country.
And so I also think that it
might be.
Advantageous for that state to
put open primaries for the
Republican Party because they
could probably start chipping
away at some of these races
because Mr. Speaker, General
Lydia, I know last election, the
governor's race was actually
quite tight because there were
many different independents
getting involved in the general
and actually voting for the
Republican. she did not win, but
it was one of the closest
governor's races in, in recent
history. And so Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, uh, I think that
When it comes to these
independent voters, there's been
precedent, I think in the state
of Washington.
They, there was a pack that
manipulated the process to
orchestrate a scheme to
manipulate the primary, and they
spent hundreds of thousands of
dollars to do that. And that was
something that they were
successful in getting DTS voters
to flip over to Republican or
Democrat, and that's because
they spent hundreds of thousands
of dollars. Now they don't have
to spend hundreds of thousands
of dollars because it's just an
easy fix. Go to the polls, you
already set. You can go and vote
for this person. So Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady,
I think this actually could
result in many progressive
legislators in this body
potentially being defeated by
moderates in the primary, don't
you agree?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, well
that would certainly be sad, um,
because then our debates
wouldn't be as cool, Mr. Speaker
and gentlemen, um, I, I, I first
I don't know what instance
you're talking about, um,
because I have not heard of that
really coordinated effort, but
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um, I
think we should remember who
these independent voters are.
Independent voters declined to
stay, sure, they're leaning one
way or another, but Mr. Speaker
and
gentlemen, these folks have made
up many of them. Some of them
don't realize that they're
unaffiliated. Many of them have
made a conscious decision. They
don't want to affiliate and Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, I'll just
talk about our generation, Mr.
Speaker, um, and gentlemen, 40%
of young voters identify as
independences or declined to
state. They don't identify with
one party or another and Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, well it
is true that so you know folks
say well they should, they
should just pick a party, you
know, just.
Choose one or the other, uh, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen.
Our hope is that with a bill
like this, folks, we would first
of all be able to understand
independence more, um, but that
doesn't mean that, for instance,
a, a party wouldn't received the
list of folks who chose that
primary ticket that day, um,
that they would be able to reach
out to, that they would be able
to understand so Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, we're talking about
independent voters to say that a
Republican Party may go to those
independent voters and say hey
we have this great scheme.
Will you guys go and do this or
do that, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, these are folks who
have chosen not to affiliate
with the party.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, and I actually
completely understand these
people's thought process.
Myself, the Republican Party,
for example, in 2015.
I was kind of sick of the old
warmonger mentality of my party,
and that's why I supported
President Trump in the primary.
A lot of people laughed in my
face and said, oh, that'll never
happen. But because President
Trump was not a traditional.
You know, cookie cutter
Republican.
Like a George Bush, for example,
he was a populist based upon
what the people wanted. That's
why I supported him, and I think
that's why a lot of people in
the in the independence support
him and the same thing in 2016
with Bernie Sanders with the
Democratic Party. A lot of the
people in the Democratic Party
were very disenfranchised with
the current state of their party
and they voted for Bernie
Sanders in the primary after he
switched his party, which he was
forced to do to run in the
Democratic primary. So I do
understand these voters and so
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, for
me,
As someone who ran in this
district.
Where I'm so blessed to live and
I ran against an incumbent
legislator in the Republican
primary, I had to talk to voters
all across the spectrum. I
think, I, I, I probably got
independence. I got Democrats to
help switch over to vote for me
just by talking to them at their
door. Now, I didn't go door to
door and tell them, oh, you you
should switch. But I think
that's actually helped bring me
to the legislature talking to
everybody because I didn't just
stop at Republican doors. I
stopped at everybody's doors and
said, hey, I'm running. So Mr.
Speaker
gentle lady, I, I think this
actually could bring more, more
people like us in the
legislature potentially.
But I also wanna keep in mind
some of the people in the
parties. I don't want them to
have a back door way to close
off all the people and all the
populace from voting in a
primary by having a closed
convention on the county level
or on the, the state level, so I
believe that has happened in
some cases in in some states
like Virginia, the state of
Virginia, the, the Republican
primary, primary for Bob Good.
They took out the former
representative in that seat, and
they.
did that through a closed
process, not through on the
ballot with the voters deciding.
So how can we evade those kinds
of situations with this idea,
because I'm not against this
idea by any stretch of the
imagination, but I just want to
make sure that we're all on the
same page. I want as many voters
to vote and could this have a
back, a back channel to have a
more closed primary. That's my
concern.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
No, I mean,
While many folks may speculate
about this bill and speculate
about what would happen, um, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen.
As I've said, other states have
this, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
what we see, um, looking at
experts in the for instance in
the Colorado case when this uh
system was challenged they had
an expert from Vanderbilt, um,
Doctor Slides who reviewed the
literature, the court found that
that literature didn't really
show that there was any kind of
this um party raiding happening
or strategic voting, so Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, while
there is speculation, uh, Mr.
Speaker.
gentlemen, I, I'm not convinced
that it will change necessarily
outcomes, but Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, what I am convinced
of is that it will increase the
number of people who will be
participating in primaries, um,
up to 9 points as we've seen in
other states.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and I think 9 points
matters, right? Because if I was
running a campaign and and deep
blue areas of Albuquerque for
someone who is a more moderate
individual in that party, it
would benefit me to get those
voters to help vote in that
primary because they'd get those
people and I could flip some of
these seats from progressives to
more moderates, and so I think
that actually could be a benefit
for the state. I don't know. I,
I, I'm really
I'm thinking about it. I mean, I
really am thinking about it from
like a strategic standpoint, me,
my party, I would love to get 36
seats in this house. Sorry, Mr.
Speaker, but I would. I would
love to take back the majority,
and I think this, I don't know,
this probably is a way to do it.
And it may, it may not be the,
the thought process behind your
bill.
But it might just be the way to
do it. And so,
That is an interesting
consideration for me. I, I love
People who are freedom minded
individuals. I like people who
are more independent thinking,
and this could be the way to get
it. Wouldn't you agree with
that?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, I
think that that argument relies
on the presumption of what an
independent voter is and who the
independent voter is, um, your
presumption I think is that
those independents will be more
likely to side with um someone
who's more radical, for
instance, or Mr. Speaker, that
they, uh, are more likely to
decide with a more moderate
candidate, but Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, the reality is that
independences are pretty much
split down the middle with how
they lean and Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, uh.
What we have seen is that in
other states that that have this
that that outcome is not
necessarily changing in the
lawsuit that the um all the
party, many parties in, in
Colorado brought on this
semi-open primary, uh, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen.
They could not provide evidence
having 3 years of primaries
evidence they could not provide
evidence that um independent
voters were somehow party rating
or swinging or changing
elections in any kind of
substantial material way. The
only thing that the court said
is um and I'm I'm just using the
court Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
because um they are the ones who
reviewed all this evidence and
looked at it, but Mr. Speaker
and and um and gentlemen.
The only thing that they said
that they could really find is
that more people turned out to
vote. That was the main thing
and if that is within the
state's interest, it is within
our state interests to increase
the amount of people who are
voting in primaries, especially
when 60% of um of districts are
decided in a primary.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and you're right, a lot of
the time in the general or in
the primary, there's not even a
primary to be had in many of
these places and in the general
there may not even be because
it's so far, so far left, so far
right, so Republicans are
Democratic, but I wouldn't say
I, I've presumed about these
voters. I honestly have no idea
what the makeup of these
independence is, but I will say
politics 101, you increase your
pot of voters.
the better chance you have to
get the outcome that you're
looking for because you have a
bigger universe of people to
talk to, right? So Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, if I have, if I, I
do buy data for my campaigns and
the data specifically says which
these, which of these
independents will lean toward
you and which independent will
lean toward the democratic
opponent, right? So when it
comes to that, I'm just gonna
get all those voters that are
leaning toward the Republican
Party and who are DTS. I have a
bigger pot, so I have more
people I can talk.
To to win a primary now and that
could benefit the democratic
primary or the Republican
primary to get more moderate
candidates. So that's the way
I'm seeing this is if, if we're
trying to get back to everyday
politics. We want the most
normal kinds of or not normal. I
don't know, we're not abnormal,
but I would, I would say
probably the most
Moderate, so it's, it's more of
a 50-50 shift. I think that
could be the key for the
Republican Party to winning back
this chamber in the Senate.
As well as maybe the
governorship, we could even, you
know, there's a candidate now
who's running for governor.
And the Democratic primary
probably wouldn't be this
election cycle, maybe the next
one when this bill goes through,
but we could theoretically get a
more moderate candidate on the
governor's side on the
Democratic primary, and then the
same maybe the Republican
primary and maybe maybe that's
the key. I don't know what the
key is to winning New Mexico for
the Republican Party. I would
love to see it, and I think this
might actually be the vehicle
that we could use to do that. So
I'm still going to listen to the
debate. I think it's, it's been
very fruitful for me and uh I'm
having little light bulbs go off
in my head.
But I do think that certainly
the part, the Republican Party
could stand to benefit from
this, so I'm heavily considering
it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
There is for the debate, the
young lady from Bern Leo and
Sandoval Representative Gates.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh, does
the gentle friend from Bernna
Leo Yield.
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I yield to my
gentle friend from Bernao and
Sandoval.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Speaker, and
thank you for that robust uh
conversation, uh, but just to
get back onto the bill and
instead campaign planning, um,
let's go back to the bill. So we
have approximately about 25%
individuals registered voters in
the state of New Mexico that are
declined to state or
independent, is that correct,
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, uh,
gentle person, yes. And thank
you, Mr. Speaker, and, and thank
you very much, my gentle friend,
um, so.
I am, I, as a representative,
when you, uh, when you went
through your first campaign this
time period. Do you feel when
you sit and you represent um
here in our great chamber in the
people's house are you
representing Democrats or you're
representing the individuals
from your district.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, uh,
gentle person, uh, I'm making
decisions for my district. And
thank you very much, uh, uh, Mr.
Speaker and my gentle friend,
can you tell me why, why was
this bill so important to you?
Mr. Speaker, and um gentle
person, this bill is so
important to me because there
are so many folks now, um, who
are declining to state or
unaffiliated, um, especially
young people and um 40% of young
people are identifying as um
independent and I think Mr.
Speaker and gentle person,
that's because um the parties
have not necessarily shown um
what those folks wanna see and
Mr.
Speaker and gentle and gentle
person, um, I am a party person.
I love my Democratic Party, uh,
Mr. Speaker and, and gentle
person. I want us to win in our
races because I believe good
democratic values um are making
good policies, but Mr. Speaker
and um gentle lady, I believe
that this policy is about
bringing more people in, um,
whether that means that the
Republican Party is getting a
list of folks who have chosen
the Republican ballot and
now have folks who they know,
um, lean their way and can uh
let them know about policies or
the Democratic Party is doing
that, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady for me this was about
democracy and strengthening our
democratic republic to involving
more folks in the electoral
process.
Thank you so much Mr. Speaker
and thank you very much for that
summation. When, um, I, I read
in, in, on some of the data that
I've been reading out for the
last several years on this
because this is a very important
topic to myself as well, um, I
heard that would declined to
stay independence, tend to vote
with whoever their neighbors
are. Is that true? And do you
remember where that study came
from, Mr. Speaker, General
Friend?
Um, Mr. Speaker, and, and gentle
lady, um, so that is mainly if
if your district is conservative
or your district is very blue,
um, but Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, there is a study from USC
that tries to identify whether
or not voters come out, uh, more
moderate or uh if candidates
come out more moderate based off
of these kind of open open
primary system so Mr. Speaker
and gentle ladies semi-open
wasn't as analyzed and Mr.
Speaker and um gentle person.
Folks do vote more moderately
when they are primaried, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, but
they could not really identify a
correlation between um.
Between necessarily the type of
primary um and the way that
folks in Congress specifically
vote.
Thank you very much Mr. Speaker.
I, I agree, you know, I, uh, I
very much trust the voters in my
district and I have more than
25% independent declined the
state voters, um, and, and I
find that just as our gentle
friend who you were debating
with earlier, it's really about
the relationship building for
the door to door and making sure
that people are felt heard and
that you are representing their
values, their culture.
But the many of the individuals
are not um wanting to choose a
major party and you're finding a
much higher percentage than that
25% when it comes to uh tribal
members individuals under 37
years old, um, and, and what
other groups that tend to even
be higher than that 25% general
uh Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker and
gentle person, veterans are
another very large group of
independents. I, I would concur
with that.
And so thank you very much, Mr.
Speaker and gentle person. Um,
I, uh, uh, I would like to know,
so this, this process is only
for DTSs and independents. So if
you're in any minority party,
any major party, you're not
going to, um, your polling place
and at selecting a different
party's ballot. Is that correct,
uh, Mr. Speaker and gentle
person. Uh, Mr. Speaker and
gentle person, so DTS is a
status, it's not.
party, so they, they would be
just choosing to affiliate with
either the Democratic Party
ticket or the Republican Party
ticket. So thank you very much,
Mr. Speaker and thank you,
gentle friends. So that is the
only individual who's going to
the, to the polling place and
requesting what pallet to
pretiable so I can't as a as a
DTS individual, they can't vote
for some Republican candidates
and some Democratic candidates,
correct? They must choose a
ballot.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
yes, they must choose a ballot
that, uh, that system would be
an open primary which uh many
other states have, um, but that
is not what we are proposing
today. We are only proposing
that those unaffiliated voters
get to choose one party or the
other.
Uh thank you, Mr. Speaker and
thank you gentle friend. You
know, I, I've heard this, uh,
this bill we've, we've been
debating this bill for years and
then I really watched the
committee work, uh, that the
senator has done, um, and to be
able to bring it into our great
chamber here of 70 and one of
the misconceptions I've heard as
well is, is the DTS voters.
are
Uh, indecisive, uh, Mr. Speaker,
uh, General Person, to find them
to be indecisive.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentle
person, uh, what, what we find
is that independences are really
thinkers. They're issue voters,
um, they are candidate voters as
the gentleman from Otero
described earlier, um, you know,
they, they, they like a
candidate, they'll vote for that
they're not um primary, they're
not party voters. Yes, thank
you, Mr. Speaker. Yeah, I always
say their policy, their um their
uh their policy, their, their uh
Relationship building they are
character voters, um, Mr.
Speaker, in, in, in full
disclosure, you know, one of my
closest friends who works on one
of my pants, she's a DTS
independent, and she finds it
offensive that she would have to
choose a party at primary
because she is a DTS because
that's what she wants to be. She
does not want to affiliate um
with the party. She wants to be
able to take make her decision.
as an individual one on one, Mr.
Speaker, general person.
Um, can, is there, um, can you
tell me, uh, do we also have
support from the county clerks.
Many of the county clerks have
come out by notice in our
committee meetings as well that
have come and supported this
county clerks from both sides of
the aisle. Is that true, gentle
person?
Mr. Speaker and a gentle person,
yes, there's a, a handful of
county clerks that certainly
support this and to also build
off of um our conversation on
independence, Mr. Speaker and
gentle person, um, there's a,
uh, a story that.
Uh, Senator Figueroa, who is
here on the floor with me today
tells a lot, which is, um, and
her conversation with the
veteran who, um, you know, said
I, I don't understand why do you
ask me to lie when I go to vote,
just, just lie about which party
I'm part of, um, this provides
that outlet, but Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, I think it's also
important to consider why
someone might want to be
registered as unaffiliated or
declined to state and um a good
friend of mine, um.
Augustine Montoya says the story
all the time in his rural area,
you know, if someone goes to the
poll with their or to go
register to vote with their
spouse, they may choose for um
reasons of fear to, you know,
have be forced to register one
way or the other, um, but
really, uh, not want to maintain
the status or Mr. Speaker and
gentle person, um, you know,
stories about young people who
have seen politics of sometimes
tear apart their family.
uh,
Mr. Speaker, and, and, and
gentle person folks who don't
want to affiliate so closely and
Mr. Speaker and and gentle
person I think it's, it's worth
considering, you know, why would
somebody want to currently
affiliate as independent, um, so
much so that they, they wouldn't
want to go to the poll and um
even in some of these districts
where it's 60%, you know, go
and, and give up their vote
because they feel so strongly.
that they don't want to
affiliate or or put a label on
themselves, so Mr. Speaker and
um.
And gentle person, the reason
why we are bringing this bill is
for scenarios like that, um, for
those folks, those 25% of folks
in our state who, um,
Declined to stay and have very
valid reasons for that, Mister
Speaker and gentle person. Thank
you so much for that and thank
you, Mr. Speaker. I am so proud
to be associated with this bill.
I'm so proud that you're up here
representing us, representative
Peron and, and Senator Fierro
because this is opening the door
to making sure that all our
voices in our, in our uh
districts are being heard and
that we are helping and making,
holding the door for them to
make sure that their voices are
heard.
I know that many of the
representatives in our 70 seats
here, um, may affiliate with a
party, obviously because we're
all, we have no independence on
the floor at this time, but that
many of them, what they are
doing is they are voting and
representing by their
constituents by the by whether
it's the economic driver in
their district or who the
majority is of their
constituents here and that is
really the key and I think that
is what our DTS voters are
looking for and.
Thank you so much. I can think
of nothing more, uh, uh,
democratic with a small d then
um then the opening up for
voters for and I can't think of
nothing more than New Mexico. I
mean, New Mexico was founded on
independence, so thank you very
much, Mr. Speaker.
There is for the debate, the
gentleman from San Juan,
Representative Hernandez.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. There's
a general lady from Bernard Leoy
you? I yield.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, um, it,
it, in my district, uh, the, the
trying to stay it's just so
critical and and there's just so
much, um, when the primary
happens, uh, Mr. Speaker, that,
uh, you know, going to, to the
uh polling locations seeing, uh,
you know, how.
Um, uh, the voters there, um,
especially in tribal communities
where on the Navajo Nation like
we don't have political parties,
so I, I really, uh, the, the,
the questions I have, Mr.
Speaker, uh, gentle lady is, uh,
how many native youth voters are
declined to state.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, 40%.
Thank you, Mr. Mr. Speaker, I
really appreciate the uh
demographics, um, on, on this as
it gives an important
perspective, um, and, and, uh,
how many, uh, total native
voters are declined to state.
Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, we
have a very, uh, large
spreadsheet here.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
declined to stay and other
independent for Native American
voters is 23,540.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
general lady. I really
appreciate that information, um.
Mr. Speaker John lady, how many
voters will be reinfranchising
by passing this bill.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
330,000.
My last question, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, will this make
elections more representative?
Mr. Speaker, and um, gentlemen,
yes.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady.
Say no up there is for the
debate.
Quick on the button there. Do
you remember from San Juan Mon
you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh, does
the lady from Bernao yield? I
yield, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, um.
We've had this question asked in
the past a few times.
Um, in years past and, and
frankly, I've been against it
wholeheartedly in the past.
Um, generally, I think.
Each, uh.
Mr. Speaker, did I ask, I did
ask the gentle lady yield, did I
not? OK, thank you. So Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, um, in
the past I've, I've looked at
this and
I've made the philosophical
decision that
Um
That I think that uh
Um
Each party should be able to
pick.
Their own candidates.
That each party
Um
Through the, if they're going to
be in the end a Republican or a
Democrat on the ballot that each
party gets to make that decision
for themselves.
So I've
Reflexively kind of been against
this, but Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady.
I think I've seen, I, I came
here, Mr. Speaker, with
The speaker
Um, I came with the, the
speaker.
Uh, and, uh, Representative
McQueen, I think, um.
Uh, Representative Romero Andres
Romero, I think that is that all
of us, Mr. Speaker, that's left
here.
And uh we came in. Oh, who am I
missing?
Sam Johnson.
Yes, that's correct. And so Mr.
Speaker, uh,
I came in in the minority.
10 years ago or 11 years ago the
majority, yes, you're right. I
came in in the majority 10 years
ago.
From that time until now we've
seen a
A real strong slide, uh.
And Republicans losing, I mean,
we're almost
in a super minority.
So I, I'm, I'm looking at this
because New Mexico, Mr. Speaker,
up to that point had been pretty
much a
Bellwether state, um, we were
always voting for whoever the
ultimate uh.
Uh, presidential candidate was,
so I, I see this.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
where, where I've kind of
monitor the monitored these type
of bills in other states. It
tends to moderate the state a
little bit, which in my mind, I
think that's a good thing, Mr.
Speaker, I, I think we've seen.
Uh, a bunch of
Moderate Democrats get primaried
out under the current system.
I think that if this system
would have been in place.
Uh, we'd still have
Some of those folks here we'd
still have uh Ambrose
Castellano, and I think we still
have, uh, Debbie Rodella.
Uh, we'd have, uh.
Willie Madrid would probably
still be here. I, so I'm looking
at this as
From my standpoint, after seeing
10 years of, of losing market
share.
Uh, and this could very well
help us, so I'm, I'm looking at
this, Mr. Speaker, and general
lady.
I'm trying to determine, do I
stick with my
My traditional belief.
That each party should be able
to have their primary without
interference if you really want
to be part, as, as a matter of
fact, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, we've recently changed.
We've, we've recently changed
the law to where you can even
switch on the day.
Of the election to vote in
whichever.
Uh, primary you want to.
Um, but, but Mr Speaker, in, in
generally, I think both uh
Republicans and Democrats as
the as things have gotten more
vitriolic.
Um
And more partisan
I, I think we've seen people
leave both the Republican Party
and the Democrat Party. I, I,
towards independent.
So Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
I'm, I'm looking at this today.
And considering voting for this
because I
It's kind of a high risk, high
reward poker stakes here.
Does it help us? Does it hurt
us?
Um, so Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, I think
I think it depends on what part
of the state.
I think in northern New Mexico.
Why even vote in a Republican
primary.
I think this could really help
in northern New Mexico, some of
those moderates where we have
those traditional New Mexico
voters.
gives them an opportunity.
To vote
I think, uh, Mr. Speaker and
general lady, I think it could
potentially rejuvenate that
moderate wing of the Democrat
Party. I think that's.
So Mr. Speaker and general lady,
I, I don't know.
Prior to
Prior to 11 years ago,
We
As a Republican Party hadn't won
this chamber in 52 years.
And
It's been a, it's been
9 years now since I was in the
majority.
Um, so previously, Mr. Speaker
and generally just a bit of a
history lesson. New Mexico was
kind of governed.
By a coalition of.
Moderate Democrats and the
Republicans to some degree.
There was able to control budget
issues, spending issues.
So, I mean, from my standpoint,
I'm trying to determine do I
stick with my belief.
Do I stick with uh continuing
just to vote and, and leave it
the way it is, so both parties
are free of interference from
Those who will not choose a
party and even though we've
given them the opportunity to
choose on election day.
I'm trying to determine is this
worth my vote.
Like I said, this is high risk,
but there, there's a potential
high reward there for us, so can
you maybe help me get over the
hump as to why I should support
this and, and not.
Uh, not just look at it through
a partisan lens.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, I, I
wrote down some of the questions
here, but um unfortunately, I
cannot guarantee that this will
provide you the victory that you
seek, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
um, you know, in other states,
um, and it's not unfortunate,
but Mr. Speaker, in other
states, um, when this has been
enacted again, 3 years of
primary data in Colorado to show
that this does not have that
effect, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, again, um, you know,
the, the.
The
The underlying presumption that
you're relying on is that those
independents are more
conservative and Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, what we've seen is
that that is just not correct,
um, they're split down the
middle, uh, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, and in fact the
aspect of party rating where
folks are coming in and um
voting for a different party
than their affiliated to, uh,
that is, that is more likely to
happen in a closed system,
you're more likely to then have
to register.
as a Democrat and then, you
know, vote in the Democratic
primary, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, um, independences
don't want to affiliate. So Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, while you
certainly could get that list of
independents who voted as
Republicans, um, and convince
them and continue to convince
them it may be true that in the
next year they um they may
choose that they, they like a a
democratic candidate for
instance better the next year,
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen and um
one thing that you mentioned
that I just wanna
make sure it's clear is that you
cannot uh go today if you are a
registered Republican and on the
day of uh register as a Democrat
and change that that has to be
done 28 days before, um, the
time of the election, so.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
what we are really trying to do
with this bill is just to turn
out more voters and Mr. Speaker
and, and, um, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, uh, if that means
like the.
Representative from um another
representative in this body has
stated before if that means
going door to door and trying to
convince those independents um
to vote for you, Mr. Speaker,
and, and, um, gentlemen, I would
argue that is part of the
democratic process and as um a
democratic republic, it is our
hope that more than what we
currently have 17% of folks who
can participate in primary
participating that we would see
much higher rates of
participation.
Um, into the, into the 30% of
folks who are participating, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen.
Thank you, um, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, I, I, I understand
that perspective. I just, I look
at it from a, I have a partisan
pretty partisan district.
Um, Miss Speaker and gentle
lady, if, if
If I'm going to be beat right
now under the current system.
In my district, somebody would
have to be more conservative
than I am.
To win my district because my
district is very, very
conservative. So I could see
where.
Uh, where or very republican,
let's say.
They'd have to be very
republican in my district.
Which
Uh, tends to mean that my
district's gonna put out a much
more conservative candidate.
Um, if you wanna, if you want
your vote to count in San Juan
County, at least in the where,
where the outside of the
reservation where the great
population base is.
Uh, in San Juan County.
probably 100,000 voters in that.
Uh, area
Um
You don't really have a choice
but to to be a Republican if you
want to affect the Republican
primary.
And then you get to choose, uh,
in the meantime,
I think that
What I think what we saw
Over the past several years in
uh.
In northern New Mexico was.
An effort
A coordinated effort just to
win.
Uh, in the Democrat Party and
then it didn't matter because
there weren't enough
Republicans.
Or independence combined to.
Potentially
Run a candidate against, so I,
so Mr. Speaker, generally, I
think in those districts, they
were, they were moderate. I
think that's a good thing.
I think that's a very good
thing. I think it will represent
more people.
Um
So I'm
I'm trying to, I'm trying to see
the
The trees
Minus the forest, uh, Miss
Speaker, because I, I, I'm
having a hard time getting over
the fact that I'm, I have been.
Since 1984 when I first
registered.
As a solid Republican.
And just fought within the party
and, but I'm, I'm considering
this today. I, I am. I think
somebody came up to me and asked
me about it and I am considering
this today because I can see
where
Maybe there's not a path forward
for Republicans to, to win the
whole legislature. I think this
is probably the best chance to
get back to a governing
coalition with the Republicans
and and moderate Democrats, so.
Um
I'm going to determine here in a
minute whether or not I support
this or not. I, I see positives
and negatives. I'm trying to,
I'm trying to determine whether
the, the risk.
or the reward outweighs the
risk.
And um and it's just me.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
There is for the debate, young
lady from Bern Leo and Torrens,
Representative Lord. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker. Will the gentle
lady from Berlin will please
yield.
I yield
So Mr. Speaker and gentle
ladies, so walk me through this.
So we have.
So this is just for primary.
And this is for statewide too.
That would be anyone who's
running for governor. Is that
correct, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady?
Yes, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, yes.
So Mr. Speaker Delaney, how many
other states do a statewide open
primary, not at a mic not at a
municipal or not at a city, how
many do you statewide.
Mr. Speaker Delaney. Um.
Mm
Mr. Speaker, and, and gentle
lady, the exact same kind that
we're proposing today.
So yeah, Mr. Speaker, John, how
many other states do a statewide
open primary.
So Mr. Speaker and dental lady,
um, statewide open primary is
different from what we're
proposing, but the number of
states that do a completely open
primary are 15.
So Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies,
so, uh, walk me through this,
uh, because.
I lived in another state where
they closed the closed this
because they had issues and you
had to go by your party, so
right now as it stands, Mr.
Speaker lady, my DTS is that
they'll switch to Republican
about me, so we still have that
ability for DTS to have a voice
if they pick a, a party. Is that
correct, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, Mr. Speaker, and gentle
lady, yes, and is that state
that you're talking about
California?
No, Mr. Speaker, gently, I was
talking about Idaho.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um.
Yeah, they used to have open
primary and they closed it.
So Mr. Speaker Delaney.
I have a question.
So when they go into the ballot,
the DTSs they walk in and they
say,
Or they hand it, how does this
work? They walk in and say, Mr.
Speaker to lady, hi, I'm here to
vote. I would like a Republican
straight ticket or Democrat
state ticket, is that how that
works, Mr. Speaker John Lee. Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, yes.
So then, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, if we really wanted to on
our side or on your side, I'm
just gonna, I'm gonna pick on
your side because we're in the
minority.
So Mr. Speaker lady, we could
technically go get those DTS
voters.
There are about 50 51%.
Very conservative because most
of what I find about the DTS is
must be delay, they hate both
our parties.
Honestly, they don't like either
one. They don't like the
Democrat Party and they don't
like the GOP. They don't like
either one.
So we're speedily, so we could
technically, let's say in a
race.
I'm gonna just say for example
Deb Holland's running, and maybe
she has a primary, we could then
technically on our side mobilize
our DTS as going in the primary
to take out Deb Holland and
actually get the other person to
win. Is that correct, Mr.
Speaker, Dan Leni?
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, um,
that would be a form of
strategic voting and, and you
know we don't really see that
happening, uh, Mr. Speaker, and,
and, um, gentle lady, you know,
if, if, um, I mean the same
could be said about uh the other
side, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady. Absolutely, Mrs. I guess
now I'm trying to figure out we
got two of the worst candidates
that neither one wanted, Mr.
Speaker Delady, so I, I guess
we're run into a problem is
like,
As a Republican, I want to vote
for the best of my candidates
and same thing for you guys, you
want to go and vote for the best
of your candidates now I was an
activist before I got into
politics. I'm very good at
mobilizing people and I know you
guys are also good at mobilizing
people. So what I see at the end
of the day, Mr. Speaker lady, we
got mobilized, we picked the
worst of your candidates.
And you guys got mobilized and
picked the worst of our
candidates and now we have the
two ones that nobody wanted
running in that race, so I'm
speaking gently, that's why I'm
probably not gonna vote for this
because I, I think if you really
like that party or DTS you have
the option to go and register
for that. So thank you, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady lady
from Eddie and Lee,
Representative Brown. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Mr.
Speaker. Will the gentle lady
from Bernalillo please yield. I
yield.
Thank you very much.
Well, Mr. Speaker, and uh gentle
lady, well we've been debating
this bill I received a message
from um one of our county
clerks, um, I think you may
know, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
that our county clerks are
elected in, uh, elections and,
um, the clerk's affiliate, um,
has members of the Democrat
Party, the Republican Party,
and, uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, did I understand you to
say earlier that you believe
that if this bill
houses, it would make less work
for county clerks and they would
therefore support it.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
um, I said there were some
county clerks who um have, but
the, the.
The affiliation is neutral.
Well thank you very much. I, I
have, I guess some updated
information to share with the
body, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady.
Um, the, the affiliate uh met or
had a meeting on February 11th
of this year.
And um they voted um to not
support this bill, uh, the vote
was 24 opposing the bill and 9
members were absent, so I just
wanna.
I, I hope clear up a
misconception, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, that the
affiliates, um.
Uh, you know, we're somehow
supporting this bill and I, you
know, we, we treasure every
county clerk we have, we know
the.
The work they do and it's done,
uh, I think very well and um
they, they just don't think this
bill is necessary, uh, I guess
for our counties. So Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I don't
have a question for you. I just
wanted to share that
information. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker.
The gentle lady to close.

Third reading of legislation.
See, no objection.
It is
So
Ordered
All right, hold on, I don't know
what I'm doing. Give me a
minute.
Are there bingo cards going
around?
Yes, no.
Gilman from Sandoval, are you
ready on item number 38.
Yes, Mr. Speaker, can you get me
to that point?
To the PowerPoint, let the
record reflect that a deserved
for placing Senate Bill 112 as
amended on final passage has
been taken and it's subject to
debate amendment or
substitution, gentlemen, to
explain the bill.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Uh,
Senate Bill 112 provides a
property tax exemption for
student housing facil facilities
located on land owned by exempt
higher education ins
institutions, but least by
non-exempt entities back to the
institution and with uh Mr.
Speaker, I stand for questions.
The gentleman from Sandoval and
Santa Fe said in McQueen.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, will the
gentlemen yield?
I will
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, who
benefits from this bill?
Uh, so it will be the higher
education institutions UNM NMSU,
um, we even found out through
this process that um Nimi will
be one of those.
So Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
those, those entities are
already tax exempt. So, so my
question is who benefits from
this tax break?
So,
I believe that the answer you
are looking for is.
The um the companies that run
the student housing for the uh
higher ed institutions.
So Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
that's, that's correct. It's a
tax break for non-exempt
entities, that means for-profit
companies that own and operate
buildings that happen to be on
land owned by a university that
otherwise would be taxable.
So Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
members of the body, this is a
big tax break for some private
corporations. It's not for our
schools and universities.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
There is further debate, young
lady from Donana, Representative
Kadena.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the
gentleman from Sandoval County
yield.
Mr. Speaker, I do yield.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Following on the debate we just
heard, I wanted to clarify two
things that um we're represented
today differently than they were
in the House Tax Committee.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, who does
benefit from the passage of SB
112?
To be clear, the single entity,
what is their name?
Mr. Speaker, and Representative,
the, uh, American campus
communities, um, at least at
UNM.
So Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I
thought we'd established this in
the House Tax Committee, but did
you or your co-sponsors consult
with any of the other higher ed
institutions or the council of
university presidents before
moving this bill forward.
Mr. Speaker, and uh madam from
Dona Anna, uh, I am being told
by my expert now.
So Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I
thought I heard you say in
response to the first question
of the day that this bill would
benefit.
Several higher ed institutions,
including NMSU, would you
clarify what that position
meant?
Uh, Mr. Speaker and madam.
Uh, the property tax exemption
is on the property that the
higher education.
Uh, institutions owns, um, in
most cases or at least in UNM's
case, cause that's what I am
aware of is that they also own
the buildings, um.
And not American campus
communities, I'm gonna mess that
up at some point, um, they're
just the property management,
uh, company, UNM owns the land
and the buildings that would be
exempted by this.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, then.
If the higher ed institution
already is tax exempt because
they are state institution, then
what's the impetus for this
bill?
Mr. Speaker and Madam, uh,
Representative, uh, the.
Uh, county assessor has now
taken the position, um, at least
in Bernalillo County that they
are that.
These types are no longer
exempt.
So this is clarification,
um, it's my sense in the FIR
that I've read on this bill and
a similar one, the assessors
have the right to take that
position because the statute is
quite clear. It says that even
if the state owns the property
if it is leased to an
organization that has a
for-profit interest, the
exemption does not carry, so to
confirm, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
this is not a clarification, but
this is actually enacting a tax
base for a single.
entity a for profit corporation
that is not based in New Mexico.
So Mr. Speaker and Madam
Representative, um, that is true
except for in cases of
education.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I don't
understand it, can you explain
to me the educational exception?
OK, Madam Speaker, and, uh, or
sorry, Mr. Speaker and.
Gentle lady, um.
It is
What you had quoted that it is
not exempted is true except for
when the property has an
educational use which student
housing to me would be an
educational use.
So, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, yes,
the UNM will never be subject to
to these kind of taxes because
they are state owned property,
but just to clarify because
what's happening here is
different than what was
communicated to us in the FIR is
that this.
Well, should it pass, and I
expect that it will, is actually
not for the benefit of higher ed
institutions. They already
receive such benefit in the way
our tax code is written today,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I
appreciate that the statute of
our tax code is quite a mess and
certainly needs a rewrite. Um, I
look forward to that in the
future, but in the meantime it's
important to be on record to
know there's a single entity
that will benefit from this tax
break, um, based on their
proximity and and usage of a
building owned by UNM who
already
enjoys the tax break, so thank
you, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker, I'd like to, um, I
agree with you on the statute
and one of these days I look
forward to working with you to
clean that up.
See, you know, for the debate
gentlemen to close.
Mr. Speaker, I do now move the
SB 112 as amended, do not pass.
We're on final passage of Senate
Bill 112 as amended.
The vote is now open.
The vote is about to close.
The vote is now closed with 23
votes in the affirmative, 38
votes in the negative.
Senate Bill 112 as amitted has
failed to pass the House.
Gentle lady from Bernard Leo
Representative Dixon, are you
ready on item number 36.
Yes, Mr. Speaker, will you get
me to that point?
Let the record reflect that all
action necessary for placing
Senate Bill 78 on the final
passage has been taken and that
is now subject to debate
amendment or substitution
generally to explain the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Since
2002, New Mexico certified
registered nurse anesthetists
have been able to practice
without the supervision of
supervision of physicians due to
an executive order issued by
Gary Governor Gary Johnson, uh,
this legislation just puts that
into statute. With that I'll
stand for questions.
Seeing no debate generally
close.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move
that Senate bill 78 do now pass.
We're on final passage of Senate
Bill 78.
The vote is now open.
The vote is about to close.
The vote is now closed by a vote
of 64 in the affirmative, 0 in
the negative, Senate Bill 708
has duly passed this house.
Gentlemen from Donna Anna, are
you ready on item number 52?
Before you get started, there's
been a request for the gentlemen
to remove their jackets.
And you may go ahead, gentlemen.
Thank you, Madam Speaker. Can
you take me to that point?
Let the record reflect that all
action necessary for placing
Senate Bill 92 on final passage
has been taken and that is now
subject to debate, amendment, or
substitution.
Gentlemen, to explain the bill.
Senate Bill 92 is a cleanup bill
that provides tech uh technical
fix for Senate Bill 336, which
was passed during the 2023
legislative session, uh.
And with that I time for
questions.
Seeing no debate, gentlemen to
close.
Madam Speaker, I now move that
Senate Bill 92 do not pass.
We are on final passage of
Senate Bill 92, the vote is now
open.
The vote is about to close.
The vote is now closed by a vote
of 63 in the affirmative, 0 in
the negative. Senate Bill 92 has
duly passed this.
House.
OK, if the body could please
OK, gentlemen from Curry de
Baca, Guadalupe, Roosevelt, and
San Miguel, representative
Zamora, are you ready on
supplemental item number 5.
The Senate Bill 220.
Yes, Madam Speaker, will you get
me to that point?
Absolutely, let the record

The direct reflect the election

Bill 364 on final passage has
been taken and it is subject to
debate amendment or substitution
generated to explain the bill.
Thank you Mr. Speaker this would
expand qualifications to DACA
recipients, and with that, I
will stand for questions.
There is debate, gentlemen from
Sandoval Representative
Martinez.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well,
the kind lady from Santa Fe
yield. I will yield
to my friend from Espana.
You know you're from the north
when you say that.
So Mr. Speaker, kind lady, um,
there's a lot of concern about
background checks, uh, light
detector tests.
Can you address some of those
concerns?
Uh, yes, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
so, um, there, this is a
practice, um, just to clarify
for the body, um, these
qualifications would be expended
extended for law enforcement
officers who have, um, the
qualifications of DACA. So to be
in this nation, there's several
things that you need to um be
able to prove, um, to be able to
receive, um, the status of DACA
in the country, um, that said,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, with
that same sort of
level of background checks,
there's a greater rigor when it
comes to our police departments,
as we've seen demonstrated in um
the uh Chicago, Illinois area,
which was our expert on this
bill, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
they do a number of, of variety
of background checks, including
polygraph testing, they do
criminal background check. They
do, of course, uh, assessments,
psychological assessments, and
otherwise, uh, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, to ensure that the
qualifications, um, for not only
any individual
but certainly this class of
individuals within um the
certain um citizen
classification, um.
would be qualified for that
position, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and kind
lady. So.
Um, this isn't open to just.
Any immigrant that
Decides they want to wear a
badge and carry a gun. Is that
correct?
Uh, that's correct, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen. Again, you have to
meet a number of rigorous
qualifications to do this work.
And Mr. Speaker, kind lady is
New Mexico, New Mexico is not
the first to do this.
Not at all, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen. Um, we, I, I don't, I
can't have the data in front of
me, but we would be probably,
um, I would say past 10 states
that are already doing this, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen.
And Mr. Speaker, kind lady, this
would
Um, go a little, a little ways
to solve the issue of not having
Um
Enough law enforcement
officials.
Uh, or people applying to law
enforcement agencies across the
state, is that correct?
That's absolutely correct, Mr.
um Speaker, gentlemen, in
addition, um, we are also
finding that those who are of
DACA status that are serving as
police officers also have a
greater understanding of the
communities and with which they
serve in, so there's the
cultural competency, the
linguistic competency, often
they are bilingual, um, and, and
able to actually speak to the
community in which they are
serving in.
thing, Mr. Speaker, kind lady,
and could you, uh, introduce
your expert?
Yes, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um,
my expert today is, um, Senator
Nava, um, and I believe we may
have another coming in, but.
Jessica Martinez, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, kind lady, just
a couple of more questions. Um.
How long has this type of
program been around in in this
country.
Mr. Speaker, uh, gentlemen,
The citizenship status
questions, um, has been around
for about 13 years now. Um, so
DACA recipients, um, have been
members of our, of our community
for, for many of us, most of our
lives.
Mr. Speaker and kind lady, and
in committee there was a
question about.
Whether these um
DACA recipients would be able to
carry their weapons home.
Uh, take home cars, that type of
issue.
Uh, what, what would be your
response to that?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so we
have a letter from the
Department of Justice federally
regarding exactly that um
exemption for those um who are
pursuant to the Gun Control Act
federally, um, there's a limited
exception that applies applies
to firearm disabilities
contained in 18 USC, um, I'll
look at the statutory framework
if you're interested, but it
includes an exemption for
firearms and ammunition issued
for any federal, state, or local
Department of Agency, where
folks are actually certified to
do that work and commissioned to
do that work, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen. So we do have, excuse
me, we do have a letter um from
the Department of Justice
stating just that.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, kind
lady, thank you for the
responses and I enjoyed the
conversation.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
There is for the debate.
The gentleman from San Juan
representative Hall.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the
gentle lady yield? Yes, Mr.
Speaker, I yield to my friend
from Judiciary.
The 2nd.
Thank you, gentle lady. Um, is
this program reserved just for
DACA recipients.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, this
would be for not just DACA, we,
that has been the focus, um, but
for anyone with legal um
authorization to do work in this
country, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
that is qualified to do law
enforcement work.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, this
would
Not be just reserved for Spanish
speakers.
No, absolutely not, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen. We know that there's
a wide range of multilingual
communities um across the state.
So certainly, um, if they're
qualified, both based on their
citizenship status to work, um,
and of course other
qualifications such as
multilingual abilities, that
would be a great asset to us,
um, in law enforcement, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen.
And Mr. Speaker, generally, as
far as funding goes, cause we've
discussed background checks.
And the ability to do a
background check unless that
person has been raised here and
even that raises some flags.
I think would be of a
Of interest it was in the uh
DPS.
Analysis
That they would have to have an
additional investments.
Can you speak to that gentle
lady?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, the only
increased opportunity is the
increasement, increasing cost of
perhaps recruitment because now
we can actually recruit in
communities, um, you know, for
advertising and outreach, um, to
attract these, um, qualified
citizens that have the ability
to work in communities. So
really that only the cost that
was anticipated by the FIR was
just to be able to do that kind
of outreach.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, and
also if they're here on a work
authorization, and if they're
allowed to carry a weapon while
they're doing this and
What if the work authorization
is revoked during either the
background check or the actual
training, uh, Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, just
like for any person that, um,
lawfully obtains a firearm in
this country. Everything would
be vetted if they are no longer
allowed to do that work for any
reason and carrying a firearm
or, um, for any other reason,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, they
would be compliant, um, with the
specifics of obtaining and
retaining that firearm.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and one of the concerns of
Hiring people that
Made their first loyalty may not
be to the Constitution of the
United States of America,
generally.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, that
would be your assumption. Um I
think folks that serve and
protect in this country, um,
have done, have taken an oath
not only to the folks that they
serve, but certainly to the
communities in which they live,
um, I don't see any of that
being a problem, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, especially for those
that are among the communities
of law enforcement that we know
are true here in New Mexico.
And Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
unfortunately, it's not an
assumption.
Um, throughout our law
enforcement in the nation, I
know firsthand of people who've
come here with families as
children that were deep plants
from, uh, nation states that are
enemies to the United States.
So we've had to deal with this
at a national level.
My question would be,
How are we definitely assured
That a foreign national who
wants to be a law enforcement
officer in our nation would
indeed be loyal to our nation.
Was that a question, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen? Yes, their
loyalty was the question, uh,
gentle lady, Mr. Speaker.
Can you repeat the question? I'm
sorry, I didn't hear that.
Not a problem, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
I was saying
We've seen it on multiple
instances.
In the United States.
Within my last organization, the
CIA, not to mention local and
state law enforcement.
Where people have come from
other nations.
It's not any particular
nationality.
And
They came here with the distinct
purpose. They were raised here.
And then with nefarious
intention.
Got into law enforcement,
causing a great deal of problems
because we are truly unable to
do an extensive background check
of people who come from another
country.
That's a statement, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, and one that I don't
agree with, um, I think when we
understand those who have been
here, perhaps all of their
lives. This is the only nation
that they know they're including
the person sitting to my left,
Mr. Speaker, gentleman, this is
uh an understanding that when we
take oaths and when we um decide
to serve and protect in this
country, decide to serve the
people of our communities, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, what I
believe your statement was
saying is more of a conspiracy
than anything else.
Mr. Speaker, no, ma'am, it is a
fact.
We've had people come in to this
nation from China, from a nation
in the Middle East who came here
as children.
We raised
Joined law enforcement.
Specifically, a couple of
Federal organizations, one
beginning in the navy enlisted.
Coming through, getting in,
getting clearances.
And indeed turned out to be
spies for enemy states, not an
assertion, not made up. It's a
fact.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, again,
while these nuanced situations
in fact have happened across the
country, um, when we look at the
importance of doing these
background checks, the
importance of the rigor with
which we have seen folks who are
DACA recipients in particular
who have been our experts
throughout this process who
understand that the folks that
are doing this work in law
enforcement, protecting and
serving in our communities, the
conspiracies in which you have
discussed in the, the
hypotheticals and
that we know to be true over
perhaps the last 100 years, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, have not
been true with the folks that we
know who have received this
status to be able to work as law
enforcement officers in our
communities, um, when we're
talking about the department,
um, the police department in
Chicago that has been our, um,
the chief that we've spoken to
throughout this process who was
our expert, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, it has no such
problem, um, with the folks that
you are talking about. And
again, if you are a deep state
spy
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, that's a
problem systemically whether
you're in the CIA or the FBI or
some of the other, you know, law
enforcement agencies that we
have federally, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, and that's a problem
that we will be dealing with as
a nation, but prohibiting folks
that are qualified to do this
work, who want to serve the
people of their community when
they have lived and worked in
our communities for perhaps
decades, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
why would we prohibit them from
doing that great work when we're
trying to perhaps weed.
a fraction of a fraction of a
fraction of a percent of people
who would be doing the work that
you're talking about, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I'm
not trying to pick on them all.
But in my limited experience of
34 years in state and federal
law enforcement.
It's not an infinitesimal
number, unfortunately.
I've seen it right here in the
state of New Mexico.
Where people were involved came
here.
Joined
Got in this case actually got
their citizenship, but because
we were not able to do a
complete background check.
Things were found out later.
It's not to pick on one of them
will be that way.
Uh, maybe the police department
in the Chicago, Illinois area
has had exceptional luck. My
message to the body is, it is a
definite possibility. This is
the same body that came after
law enforcement.
That are born and raised in this
country not that long ago.
I am simply raising the fact.
That this could be a
possibility.
It was concerned to me in the
committee that DPS did neither
endorse nor come across.
Against this,
In as witnesses for this bill or
even against it. I just, all I
had was
The, uh, performance
implications.
From their analysis. This is not
an attack on the system.
It's just simply I am pointing
out to the body is something to
be concerned, gentle lady.
So my question to you is, why
was DPS not brought to the
table?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, this is
an open process where we have
many, many folks coming to the
table, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
the Department of Public Safety
offered an analysis for us, um,
that I'd be happy to read to you
about their understanding of how
they would be vetted, how folks
would be able to be allowed to
participate in law enforcement.
They certainly have not been,
not part of the process because
again, we have a clear analysis
for them about what non-citizens
would be subject to, including
the background checks that
you're talking.
talking about, including the
rigorous program that they have,
not just for those who are of a,
a varying citizenship status,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, but for
everybody that goes through this
process, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
so, um, certainly they have been
not only um here within this
building, whether or not they
had an opinion about the bill
itself, you can read about that
in the analysis and for the
public it is online and
available for everyone to
download and look at, um, about
what, what it is they believe
would be that certification.
need, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, and I,
I appreciate that. Again, this
is not an attack on everyone.
This is
Um
The voice of experience. Last I
checked, I am the only one in
the body that's done this job
for a living.
And I just would like people to
take that into
Consideration.
That this is a possibility.
It's certainly not to bash on
everyone who wants to do this
job.
It is a difficult enough job
without throwing a lot of other
cultural barriers or preformed
prejudices if you come possibly
from another country.
Against it, so with that I
yield.
There is further the debate, the
gentle lady from Berlin and
Torrens, Representative Lord.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well,
the gentle lady from Santa Fe
County Police yield. I will
yield.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
what is a non-citizen?
Would you like the technical
definition, Mr. Sella, I'm just
trying to figure out. I know
that I, I used what I'm trying
to find is, could there be
somebody who just moved here
yesterday from Yemen, or is it
somebody who you're considering
as a docker, somebody that's
applying to become a citizen.
Can you explain to me what a
non-citizen is, Mr. Speaker,
John lady. Mr. Speaker, gentle
ladies, so we're talking about
folks that have work
authorization, um, in the United
States that would be qualified
for the work that we're talking
about in this bill, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
OK, Mr. Speaker Deli, so these
people have to come over and
they have to have a work
authorization, is that correct,
Mr. Speaker and gen lady? That's
correct, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
be a gentle lady, um.
How do we do a background check
in North Korea?
I have no idea, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. So Mr. Speaker,
lady, I was just talking to some
people about at the academy
because whenever these things
happen, I go up and talk to
state police I'm texting law
enforcement, texting sheriff.
And what I'm finding out is you
have to have a background check
and as uh oh he ran away as a
fine representative who was in
the FBI was talking about with
doing background checks. My
understanding everything that I
see in here, it's extremely
difficult. So Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, how could you
assure me as um.
How do I put this? There's a lot
of tension right now between
certain groups. How can you
assure me that that person who
is allowed to become law
enforcement does not have some
sort of background, uh, that
would disqual them, disqualify
them actually to even enter the
academy, Mr. Speaker, gentle
ladies, so first and foremost,
um, when you have work
authorization or authorization
to be in the United States, um,
as a non-citizen, um, having
been naturally born in this
unit.
in the United States or
naturalized as a citizen, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady. There's a
vetting process through the
USCIS system that requires a
number of, um, not only
background checks that before
you receive that status, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, but that
is checked and balanced, I think
on an annual basis, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, um.
To ensure that that that
certificate of citizenship, um,
and for the level of, uh, excuse
me, for your, your status of um
being able to stay in this
country as a non-citizen, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, um, is, is
authorized, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, does that do an extensive
background check to look for
things like any sorts of crimes
and what if they lived in
multiple countries? Are you
looking at all of those
countries like maybe they moved
from North Korea to yeye men,
uh, to England and then here,
would you check all of those?
countries for their backgrounds.
criminal
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
again, if you have permanent
residents in this, um, country
and you have authorization to
work, uh, while you're on your
pathway to citizenship,
typically, um, many of these
folks are, um, you have to
maintain that you are not a
criminal, that you have
committed zero crimes and that
your squeaky clean in order to
be on that path to citizenship.
Um, you can, the infractions can
be minimal and essentially that
knocks you off the track to the.
citizenship. So Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, you're saying that
it's self-reported and it's not
a background check.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, that's
incorrect. Um, so again, with
the way that our systems operate
in order to be able to feedback
the feedback loop to USCIS, um,
those background checks, um,
would come through our law
enforcement officials if there
was uh in fact somebody lying on
an application or the continued
renewal application for
remaining in the country. Mr.
Speaker and young lady, who does
those background checks you're
talking about, because you can
talk about USCIS. Can you point
me to where in the
anywhere where it says, we are
definitely checking this person
for the came from 10 different
countries that we're looking to
see that all 10 countries say
the same thing and there is no
anything that would disqualify
them from being in law
enforcement.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
USCIS does in fact manage all of
that data and information,
including for those that are,
um, DACA recipients who've been
there there in their entire
lives, um, in the United States,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so all
of that information is available
through the USCIS system.
So Mr. Speaker Don Le, that
makes sense if somebody was in
the DACA system, born and raised
here, hasn't left the country,
but for somebody who just came
here from let's say North Korea
or Yemen or some other country,
Pakistan, they just came here
and they're a non-citizen.
Where is the background check on
them in this USCIS system, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
just a clarification, they
wouldn't have been born here,
otherwise they would be
citizens, um, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, so for those that
are in the DACA status
situation, um, they were raised
here, so it's been 13 years that
they've been in the system, um,
in having tracked and understood
their status, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and all of that
information is maintained and
followed up with through USCIS.
Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies, so
let's say someone is here in
their DACA, and I'm not picking
on DACA, my grandfather.
came here illegally from Mexico,
so what I'm saying is if
somebody is here and they're in
DACA and they leave, does that
make them disqualified for any
amount of time if they leave the
country, Mr. Speaker and John
Lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
DACA recipients cannot leave the
country without um completely
compromising their ability to
potentially reach um citizenship
status one day. Right now,
within their current status,
there is no pathway to receiving
citizenship status,
unfortunately, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. Right, Mrs. I
understand that with the DACA
thing, so what you're telling me
that this is only for DACA
people. There's no other people
that could come from another
country, come here, have this
work authorization.
You're saying they have to be a
DACA person was raised here, or
can somebody come here from
Yemen or any other country and
also get this work
authorization, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, if you
have a work authorization in the
United States coming from the
countries with which that would
be allowed to come here, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, for that
specific person if they have a
work authorization, they may be
qualified to be able to try to
enter into law enforcement
through this bill. OK, thank
you. That's finally I'm coming
around to what you're saying.
OK, so Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
so someone comes over from
another country that's allowed
to come here to get this work
authorization, you're telling
that US
CIS does a very extensive
background check and checks all
every country they ever lived in
to make sure that they'd be
qualified to work in law
enforcement.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, that
would just to be qualified to be
able to have a work
authorization. So if they were
then given a work authorization,
um, with their, uh, status, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, then they
would be qualified to apply for
a job in law enforcement in the
state of New Mexico if this bill
were to pass, and Mr. Speaker
lady, can you show me where in
this USCIS what background check
that they do, specifically like
what specifically are they
looking at and.
Does it apply to every country
they ever lived in.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
it's very comprehensive, the
system with which USCIS operates
and it vets every single
individual subject to their own
personal history. So, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady is every
person who wanted to enter the
country, um.
And have a work authorization
status through USCIS, they would
have to fill out numerous pieces
of paperwork, pay fees, they
would be subject to background
checks, um, and then typically
many, many months if not years,
in order for them to be able to
enter into the United States and
have a work status here.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, young
lady, I'm just looking at this I
765 application and can you show
me on here where just, can you
show me anywhere where this
shows that they do the
background check 100% on every
single person looking
extensively in their criminal
records before they're allowed
to get this work authorization
because I don't see it on here
yet, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
I'm, we're looking at the I-765.
There are a number of different
formats with which you can apply
for both citizenship and work
authorization and then be
subject to the numerous
background checks. So you would
have to have a special um sort
of need in the sense of being
able to be authorized work, um,
to be able to work in the United
States, there has to be a
special status for that ability
for you to have versus just
being able to be in the country,
Mr. Speaker, John lady, so.
While we're familiarizing with
some of the forms that you've
mentioned, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, I'll just continue to say
that the background checks are
rigorous and USCIS is that uh
body which was um we'll do that
background check.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
when I was just because I'm
trying to get as much
information on this because it
says here that no non-US
citizens generally do not have
access to the national crime the
uh NCIC background check, which
is a law enforcement sensitive
database so.
How would law enforcement go
about looking at these people to
do a background check on them,
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady.
So Mr. Speaker, a gentle lady,
in the, if this bill were to be
implemented, essentially first,
again, that person would have to
have a work authorization in
this country, um, secondly, when
they would go apply for the job
subject to every other person
that would essentially enter
into law enforcement and be, uh,
a potential candidate for law
enforcement subject to a
rigorous background check again,
polygraph tests, um, mental
health and psychological tests
there.
There's, of course, physical
tests. There's a number of
different background checks that
are, of course, required,
whether it be criminal, civil,
etc. Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
and then of course, um, within
your citizenship status, that
history as well, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. But Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady I just talk to
people who are high ranking in
uh some law enforcement who said
they have absolutely no way to
check for somebody's background
check out of the country. So
what did the law enforcement
officers supposed to do before
they let him into the academy,
Mr. Speaker, generally, I'm
sorry, man I'm.
Speaker and gentle lady if they
have no way to do that
background check.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, again
with the federal default for
citizenship status and work
authorization that would be the
first line relying upon the
federal government to provide
that opportunity for every
individual, again for where
whatever walk of life they come
from to be able to understand
whether or not they're qualified
to first even reside in this
country and have a work
authorization.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, as
an honest citizen person
qualified to get a high level
security job at Lane.
I'm sorry, Madam Speaker, will
you please repeat the question?
I understand. I know you got to
talk to me, Mr. Speaker, uh,
sorry, Madam Speaker, and gentle
lady can a non-citizen person
get a high level security job at
Lane.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, that
has nothing to do with this
piece of legislation, but to my
knowledge, there are um foreign
nationals that do work at Lanel.
Mr. Speaker Joan Lady, but it's
a completely different process
for them to go through. My
husband has a high level
security, so it's a completely
different process. So Mr.
Speaker John lady, so I guess
what I'm trying to get at is I'm
searching and searching and
searching and it talks about how
the FBI looks uh for a name
check, um, I see that they
review the information, but it's
not guaranteed all the time, so
we're running to an issue is
let's say we have somebody who
comes here with ill intent. I
don't think they should be able
to have this position and if you
were to tell me or if I know for
sure or if I knew that our law
enforcement had a way to check
backgrounds and I just talked to
them and they don't, so there
becomes the problem, Mr. Speaker
and gentle lady. Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, how do you get past
the ATF 4773 form that does not
allow non-citizens to have a
firearm.
Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies, so
first and foremost, we agree
with you, we would never want a
bad actor to participate in any
sort of law enforcement
activity, should they not be
qualified to do this and that
their background, um, would not
be sound for them to be able to
qualify for this position and
for those that are spies or
those that are trying to
infiltrate a system, um, however
sophisticated, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, this bill would not
permit that from happening, um,
any more than it is already.
So, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
let me clarify for that. Second
point on as far as just being
able to have, um,
Authorization to have a firearm,
there's a limited exception, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, for those
certified law enforcement
officers to carry, um, their
firearm while on duty, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, um, in
performing their official duties
as law enforcement. So that's
the special status provided
again authorized by the
Department of Justice federally,
um, in order to be able to
create that exemption specific
to law enforcement, certified
law enforcement officers, um, in
particular, Mr. Speaker
generally.
lady and Mr. Speaker, young
lady, I think I would probably
be on board with supporting your
bill if you had somebody who was
an expert who said, hey, ribs
and Lord, here's the form,
here's the background. We do it
100% of the time we check if
they lived in 10 different
countries we're making sure
they're not bad actors because I
know we do have a shortage of
law enforcement, but as it
stands, without knowing that
information, I just want to make
sure and it could be somebody
here could be a bad actor. I
mean, life happens, but I would
want to make sure there wasn't
somebody coming over who, you
know,
Pick anything, you know, a child
molester, anything, pick
anything. I just would want to
make sure that if they lived in
North Korea, Yemen or I just
picked those countries because I
know it's harder to get
information. Maybe they're not
even allowed here, but pick
another country that where we
can't do the background check. I
wanna make sure we're not taking
somebody who, you know, who
abuses children or something,
has a bad background and put
them into law enforcement, so
because of that, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, I can't support
this bill.
There is further debate
generated from Donana Notero,
Representative Silva.
Thank you, Madam Speaker. Does
the gentle lady yield? Yes, I
yield to my friends from Donana.
Thank you, um, Madam Speaker and
gentle lady, I just had a few
questions. I'm wondering what's
the process for gaining legal
permanent residency LPR getting
your green card in the United
States.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
lawful permanent residents, um,
who have been granted the right
to live and work and, uh,
permanently in the United
States, um.
Have some limitations with how
they can travel in and out of
the United States. They have to
apply for US citizenship after
meeting, um, rigorous elability
eligibility requirements. This
means usually after 5 years,
they have to wait or 3 years if
married to a US citizen, um,
there could be, they could be
sponsored by a certain family
member, um, that may already be
in the United States in order to
be able to qualify, um, and
they're limited on the benefits
that they actually receive, um,
in the United States.
They have to obey all of our
laws, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
they have to file taxes
federally and locally, um, they
have to carry proof of their
limited their lawful permanent
resident status at all times,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, and
inform the USCIS of any address
change, any move, any location
change, and they have to
maintain continuous residents to
avoid losing status, so again,
that's why that nuance of, of
when they leave the country is
is so clear.
and if they commit a crime, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, that
status is revoked immediately
and they have to stay out of the
US for as long, um,
As they can essentially they
have to stay out of the US, um,
without a re-entry permit, um,
and they can't actually leave
otherwise they abandon their
residency altogether, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Thank you Madam Speaker, gentle
ladies, so that sounds really
rigorous, um, and sounds like
there are many, many, um,
Restrictions, but also
guidelines for um legal
permanent residents and they
have to follow and that they
can't just show up and then all
of a sudden apply for a law
enforcement job and then begin
work. Is that correct, madam,
uh, Speaker, gentle lady. That's
absolutely correct, Madam
Speaker, gentle lady.
Thank you so much and then I'm
also wondering, um, our local
law enforcement, um, departments
across the state, are they
facing shortages, Madam Speaker,
gentle lady.
Yes, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
there are shortages across the
board in law enforcement in New
Mexico, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and we know that in um.
For those that we know, those
that are living in communities
that are of citizenship status
where they have the ability to
work, would love to serve in law
enforcement. And so when we look
at not only their cultural
competencies within the
community, the ability to
actually serve within these
communities would be a great
asset for for us as a state.
Thank you, uh, Madam Speaker and
gentle lady, and then um my
other question, what's the most
common reason that law
enforcement leave their current
position, uh, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies, so
there's a number of reasons why
law enforcement, um, would leave
their positions oftentimes due
to stress, PTSD. It's a very,
very difficult job, uh, both the
gentle lady, um.
The senator, uh, in our chamber,
Senator Nava and I have family
members that serve in law
enforcement. And so we know how
absolutely not only detrimental
to health, it can be with stress
and the related sort of
externalities that come with the
job, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
um, you know, the whole family
really ends up serving in this,
this role because, you know, the
concern is so real. So even
after 3 years, if someone does
decide to change jobs, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, that
experience.
never leaves them and leaves the
folks that, um, are part of
those law enforcement families,
um, and communities, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, so the num
there's a number of reasons why
folks leave, um, but most of it
is due probably, um, from the
data that we have to the stress
of the work.
Thank you Madam Speaker and
gentle lady, um, I don't
disagree with you and I would
also add that many um move
positions for higher pay or to
live closer to home, um, and so
there's a lot of turnover um for
that.
For that simple fact as well.
Would you agree with that, Madam
Speaker, gentle lady? I would
agree with that, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and when we're
trying to invite folks to the
table to be part of this work,
this very, very challenging
work. There's a huge opportunity
for us to recruit folks, um, in
this category, um, from our
neighboring states, from our,
from our state as well because
we know that even with DACA
recipients, there are at least
537,000 nationwide and over 10.
10,000 and just Texas and
Arizona right next to us. Thank
you for that, Madam Speaker,
gentle lady. So what I'm hearing
you say is that, um,
One, and what I know is that of
New Mexico's labor force that is
foreign born there's about 1 in
8 New Mexicans that are foreign
born and that's about 7 and
about 75% of them are, uh,
working age and so, uh, compared
to the rest of the US for about
60% of foreign born, um, people
are of working age and so we
have a high ready to work um
population that aren't able to
access.
Um, these sorts of jobs and want
to serve not only their country
but their state what the only
country that they know and many,
many cases, um, is that, is that
correct? Would you agree with
that, Madam Speaker, gentle
lady, I would agree with that,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, you
know, we know there's about
50,000 lawful permanent
residents living in New Mexico
and of that population we know
about 40,000 are eligible to
naturalize, um, and so when we
look at the opportunity here for
expanding.
our workforce that's qualified,
and again, you have to have the
qualifications to do this work,
uh, first and foremost before
even applying for the job. And
so that I think in and of itself
provides us a great opportunity
here to really welcome folks to
our community and cast that
broader net for folks to
understand really what what this
would require.
Thank you, Madam Speaker, gentle
lady, um, I know of DACA
recipients in New Mexico that
are doctors that are lawyers,
and they risk everything to not
only better their lives and want
to get a better education and
provide to their communities,
um.
But they have communities around
them that are supporting them
and becoming doctors, lawyers,
and teachers, um, and so why not
this really great um blue collar
job that helps not only protect
our communities, um, but they
get to then exercise the the
love that they have for their
communities, their state, their
country, um, because, um, do you
know the average age of a DACA
recipient that has come into the
country like what age?
did they, were they brought into
the United States, Madam
Speaker, gentle lady.
We're doing some math, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, because
we're going, how old are we? And
how long ago have we been?
Um,
so it's been 13 years since DACA
recipients have had their their
status. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, many of them were brought
here, um, as little kids, um,
anywhere from birth to, you
know, 5 years old. So the age
range is really vary. We don't
have the average. We're looking
that up right now, um, but we
know that their workforce age
right now, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, that's the most important
thing is that when we look at
the ages for those who would be
contributing to our economies of
scale, um, and to our
op port un ities when we're
looking at law enforcement
specifically here, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, this is the
workforce age that we would want
to recruit from.
Thank you Madam Speaker, gentle
ladies, so many DACA recipients
were brought here as babies, as
children, as toddlers, um,
didn't have a say in being
brought, but they're here and
they were raised here, um, many
don't speak the language that,
um, that some of their families,
um, had originally because they
for all intents and purposes,
um, see themselves as American
and so I would um I would wager
that like why would we blame
children?
and babies for once they're
grown up and working age that
they wanna now join law
enforcement and so or become
doctors or lawyers, um, and so,
um, I don't know if you have any
data after that, Madam Speaker,
gentle lady. We were able to
find the age range, Madam
Speaker. It's 26 to 34 years old
are the DACA, um, recipients
today within again that
workforce age coming out of
college coming out of um perhaps
some early work, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, but certainly
qualified to do this.
Thank you, Madam Speaker, gentle
lady. So that means that there
are baby babies when when they
came into the country, they
were, they were little. Um, I'm
also wondering, do you know are
some non-citizens allowed to
serve in the US military, Madam
Speaker, gentle lady. That's
correct, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, um, yes, uh, non-citizens
are allowed to serve in the US
military. Legal permanent
residents, Madam Speaker, gentle
lady. Thank you, Madam Speaker,
gentle ladies. So our US
military has already decided
this is um this is.
They're good. They qualify. They
can help protect our country
from foreign threats. Is that
correct, Madam Speaker, gentle
lady? That's absolutely correct,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady.
Thank you for that. Um, and so,
uh, with that, Madam Speaker,
General lady, I yield.
Thank you, gentle lady.
There is further debate,
gentlemen from San Juan,
Representative Montoya.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Does the
gentle lady from Santa Fe.
I will yield, Madam Speaker.
So, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady.
There has been some discussion
today about, uh, DACA recipients
and
Uh, legal green card holders
being able to possess firearms,
but there are still, as I
understand,
In other states where uh where
we, they followed the same path
that that has not been
universally.
Um
It's not universally, uh.
Being upheld that they can that
they can possess firearms. Can
you talk to about the uh what
what is it that's causing other
states for, for, uh,
The ability to possess a firearm
to be restricted to either DACA
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so, um,
I have a list of the, um, I
think.
1517, 18 states that are doing
quick quick counting, um, that
have a, uh, essentially a law
about firearm use um for law
enforcement, um, folks that have
DACA status or you uh US
permanent resident status in
order to be able just like this
law before you to possess a
firearm in the line of duties,
Mr. Speaker, General, uh, men,
so when we talk about the
examples that help.
informed this law, uh, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, we're
following a number of those
statutes that allow for that,
um, eligibility that special
status for when you are an
actual law enforcement officer,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
So, Miss Speaker and gentle lady
that I guess the question, the
question I'm asking is where I
know that these 15 states.
Uh, that they have these laws in
place, but, uh, as I've been
informed by law enforcement that
There are, there that it's not
just an easily process to be
able to get the, the, the
firearms, and there's been
rejections and some from what I
understand in some of the
states.
The provision is in place, but
the actual ability to hire has
not happened.
Because of these restrictions,
could you explain to me what
those restrictions are, what the
hurdles are that it's keeping
this uh from even where they
pass these laws to not be
enacted.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I'm
sorry, Madam Speaker, gentlemen,
um,
So you're exactly right. Not
everyone's qualified to do this
work, whether it be because
something came up during their
background check or as we heard
from our chief out in, um,
Illinois and Chicago, that
there's a lot of rigorous, um,
psychological evaluations that
would not allow, um, for folks
to be able to obtain that
firearm. So the rigor is real,
but when we look at the sort of,
um, information that we've
received from the various states
that have these types of laws.
Some have stricter, um, gun
safety laws in their state that
would prohibit folks from
obtaining a firearm, um, and
others just depending on
qualification and otherwise, um,
have that sort of um nuances to
How you would be able to obtain
a firearm. So Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, you're exactly right.
When we're proposing a very
rigorous process for which when
we're asking folks to carry a
firearm, um, in their duties,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, we want
to be very sure that they are
qualified to do that work, um,
and have the full scope of
evaluation to be able to perform
well in that duty, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen.
So Mister Speaker and gentle
lady, I don't see in this uh
bill that's proposed before us
any rigorous, uh.
All I'm hearing is a background
check.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so
again, when we're talking about
um being qualified to do a law
enforcement job generally
regardless of your, um,
Citizenship status, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, you would essentially
have psychological evaluations.
There are everything from
polygraph tests to of course
physical tests, and then, of
course, can you actually carry
that firearm well, is it
something that you can actually
perform with while in the line
of duty, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
so regardless of that
citizenship um status, we want
those folks to be qualified to
do that work.
Some speaker and gentle lady uh
text that I just got said that,
uh, that the ability for that
for uh these DACA recipients to
be able to get, um,
To be able to possess firearms,
uh, didn't have anything to do
with their background checks or
psychological checks that there
were other other problems that
came up, um, and so I'm trying
to figure out is that federal
is is it is it problems with
federal law? What is it that is
uh that is uh causing that
problem.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I'm, I'm
not familiar with the problems
that you're discussing. Um, I
think when we're talking about
folks who are qualified to do
that work within any agency that
we would um respect and honor
and understand that the rigor
for which they would be able to
qualify folks within that realm,
um, to be able to perform that
work if they found something
that was questionable that could
compromise your law enforcement
duty, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
then yes, we would not want them
to be part of the law
enforcement agency.
Um, so I, I, I don't know if the
problems are that you have, uh,
referenced, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, but with any sort of
system, we'd want it to work.
So Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
Madam Speaker, sorry, I think
I've said that a few times, um,
Madam Speaker, gentle lady, um,
Personally
I think that we need to
Create
A quicker path for DACA
recipients to get citizenship.
Because Mr Speaker and gentle
lady, that, uh, the, the reality
is DACA recipients, uh, most of
them have been here, uh, since
being a, a, uh, a very young.
And really have no connection to
any other country, maybe some
relatives in another country.
Uh, but, but Madam Speaker and
gentle lady.
I'm very concerned.
That all that for this we're
talking about anyone who has
work authorization.
How long, uh, Madam Speaker and
gentle lady, uh, how long does
it take to just get work
authorization?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so I was
just talking about lawful
permanent residents, um, and
again, it varies case to case
depending on perhaps which
country you're coming from, um,
how old you are, again, all of
these different nuances are
important to the process that
USCIS manages, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, so we can't, um, give
you a specific example or sort
of generality for where folks
are coming from when they're
requesting, um, legal resident
status or work status, um, Mr.
Speaker.
gentlemen, because it could take
everything from a year to 5
years, perhaps 10, so it really
varies.
So, uh, Madam Speaker and, and
gentle lady, I just got the
clarification on what the issue
is and Madam Speaker and gentle
lady, the issue is.
That
Uh, and particularly in
Illinois.
That
Um
You can
They were they hiring process.
Could not be that once you were
hired, then it gave you a
deferred ability to to get a
gun.
Um,
Madam Speaker and gentle lady,
the issue is you had to be able
to qualify to own a gun before
you took a law enforcement
agency position, so, um, Madam
Speaker, and generally that's,
that's the problem that's in
place is that
Uh
Just being able to qualify for
the job without already being
able to possess a gun was what
the uh was what the, the issue
is. So Madam Speaker, and in,
and gentle lady.
Um, in New Mexico, are you able
to own a gun if you're a DACA
and once again, Miss Madam
Speaker and gentle lady, DACA
means deferred status. So are
you able to own a gun in New
Mexico prior to getting uh one
of these positions.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so legal
permanent residents, um, can own
a firearm in the state of New
Mexico, um, DACA recipients
cannot, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
but if they were in the line of
duty due to the exception that
I've referred to under federal
law that the Department of
Justice discussed um within the
federal framework, um, and there
is, um,
There is statute on this
federally, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen. There is an exemption
for certified commissioned law
enforcement officers, which
would certainly apply to New
Mexico, they would be able to um
obtain that firearm in the line
of duty.
See, uh, Madam Speaker and
gentle lady, I understand that's
the problem is that it becomes
uh, what came first, the chicken
or the egg, and Madam Speaker
and gentle lady, I think the,
the, the, the reason this is a
problem is because DACA
recipients
Because they are DACA uh in uh
the DACA program are not legally
able to own a gun, so just
hiring them for a job as law
enforcement would not allow
them.
To be able to own a gun, which
would disqualify them. So Madam
Speaker and gentle lady, as I
stated earlier, I believe DACA
recipient, uh, the, the DACA
program is something that we
need to work on because that's
where we're talking about folks
who have probably their only
allegiance to America, but Madam
Speaker and gentle lady, we're
not talking about that.
We're talking about anyone with
work authorization.
And just being able to hold a
green card.
And that Madam Speaker and
generally it could be a process
even less than a year.
We can have someone in law
enforcement.
For less that's been in in the
United States for less than a
year.
And Madam Speaker, in generally,
what scares me about that
is we are a border state.
And Madam Speaker and gentle
lady,
We have high crime.
We have a lot of crime in New
Mexico and a lot of it is cartel
related.
So Madam Speaker and gentle
lady.
I'm not sure if you're aware,
but uh in right around.
2000.
Somewhere between 2008 and 2012,
uh, Madam Speaker, uh, on the,
in the small community of
Columbus.
We had another, we had an entire
police force that was
compromised because of the
cartels threatening.
Those law enforcement agents.
And the, and, uh, and their
families.
So, Madam Speaker and gentle
lady, what I'm scared about with
this provision, with this law.
is not whether or not every
individual who comes to America.
Uh, doesn't have good
intentions, uh, Madam Speaker
and gentle lady, I, I, I
generally believe people are
coming to America as the best
country in the world, uh, we
don't find many people leaving
America, even those who
threatened to leave America.
Um, the, the reality is.
Everybody wants to be here for
opportunity.
But Madam Speaker, and gentle
lady.
Not everyone who is seeking
opportunity is looking for good
legal lawful opportunity.
There are people
all across this country legal.
Not legal that
Uh, don't have goodwill towards
uh America.
In particular, Madam Speaker,
I'm talking about terrorist
organizations.
And countries that consider uh
America an enemy that regularly
chant things like uh Death to
America, burn American flags.
There are people that have, that
have come here, Madam Speaker
and gentle lady in, in recent
years.
A we we're we just saw, uh,
Madam Speaker, uh, a, a group
of, uh, Venezuelans, uh, that,
uh, gang members that have
Been, been deported.
But Madam Speaker and gentle
lady, I'm not even concerned
about that. What I'm concerned
about is
The instant where someone comes
from another country.
And they
Come here for actual good.
Legitimate
Uh
Reasons and just want to be part
of America.
But Madam Speaker and gentle
lady.
Just like those law enforcement
officers that were on the
border.
The half family many times in
another country.
And Madam Speaker and gentle
lady,
A lot of people.
We'll do just about anything to
protect their family, especially
if they're threatened.
So Madam Speaker, and generally
I think this is a risk.
We're talking about, I know
that, uh, Madam Speaker, that,
uh, when we were, when, when,
uh,
President Trump was trying to,
uh, just have raids on
Venezuelan uh cartel members.
That there were folks who had
information that let them know.
That the raids were coming.
Madam Speaker, and generally the
folks in law enforcement.
Don't even have to be in two
sensitive of an area, but Madam
Speaker and gentle lady.
If their families are
threatened.
Let's say they're from Yemen. I
heard Yemen earlier.
If they have family back in
Yemen, uh, somewhere in the
Middle East.
They can be threatened.
And Madam Speaker and gentle
lady, I think this is just a
risk.
Is that it's just too great for
New Mexico citizens, and I just
cannot support this legislation.
There is further debate
generated from Sandoval
Representative Cullen.
Thank you, Madam Speaker, does
the gentle lady from Santa Fe
yield. Yes, I yield. Thank you.
uh, Madam Speaker and gentle
lady, um.
Because I've been doing a lot of
Google searching in reference to
some of this. So maybe that I
can get some clarification now
our DACA recipients allowed to
serve in the military because it
looks like there was a pilot
program and it looks like it has
um stopped, so I just wanted to
check with that.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, no,
um, DACA recipients cannot serve
in the military because part of
the reason why they cannot is
that they have to leave the
country in order to serve and
DACA, uh, DACA status will not
allow you to leave the country,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, Madam
Speaker, gentle lady.
And Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
um, so in reference to the work
authorization that is different
than having a green card, is
that correct?
Uh, Madam Speaker.
Tinsella.
Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies, so a
green card is a type of work
authorization. There are a, a
different, if you look at the
decision tree on how you can get
a work authorization. There are
other pathways to that as well,
um, but the green card is a type
of, uh, work authorization, yes.
And Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
so can somebody with just a work
authorization go into the
military.
No, Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
Madam Speaker.
Thank you and Madam Speaker and
gentle lady, could you tell me
if those that are DACA
recipients and have a work
authorization do they have to
sign up for selective service.
Speaker, um, Madam Speaker,
gentle lady, again, they cannot,
um, serve in the military
because they cannot leave the
country.
OK, Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
that's all I have. Thank you.
There is further debate
generated from Chavez,
Representative Mejia.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Uh, does the gentle lady from
Santa Fe yield? I yield to the
gentle lady from Chavez. Oh
thank you. Uh, you know, I've
been working as an immigration
consultant for.
20 plus years.
And uh I have helped people.
And I have helped people become
US citizens and I know the
process and um one thing that I
um you guys are confusing DACA
recipients with permanent re
residents.
Permanent resident is legal in
the country it's already a green
card holder.
At DACA recipient,
It's a deferred action status is
not legal in the country and
their status has not been
approved yet.
So they are here illegally.
Now, under the gun Control Act
of 1968, it is illegal for a
person illegally or unlawfully
in the United States to possess
a firearm or ammunition.
Um
The New Mexico state law follows
federal guidelines meaning DACA
recipients are generally
prohibited.
For owning a gun.
So if line enforcement can find
a DACA recipient with a gun can
get significant fines including
10 years in prison.
This in the future can affect
uh.
DACA recipient to become a US
citizen in the future.
Now, um, what happens if DACA is
terminated.
Madam Chair, representative.
Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies, so
first and foremost, DACA
recipients are lawfully here in
the country. They have a stat, a
special status that was provided
them for protection from
deportation, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady that was authorized by
Congress in order for for there
to be a protocol for the folks
that are of that status to be
able to remain in the country,
Mr. Speaker, Generaltle lady, so
they are not breaking any laws
if they have a DACA status.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
just needed to correct the
record on that, um, can you
repeat your question?
Uh yes.
Madam Speaker, Representative,
what happens if DACA is
terminated what happens if they
enroll in law enforcement in
DACA gets terminated.
Mr. Speaker, generally, Madam
Speaker, gentle lady, um, so
we've had DACA now for 13 years,
um, in the sense that it could
be terminated, um, that would be
uncharted territory just like
the repeal of any law, uh, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, we would
have to deal with that in that
situation, but until that point,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, folks
that are of the DACA status can
continue to renew.
OK, thank you for that, uh,
Madam Speaker, Representative,
uh, what happens if DACA
recipients no longer qualifies
to renew.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um,
just as I stated, again, we
would have to see the repeal of
that law, we would get there in
the situation, if there was a
repeal, we would have to deal
with, um, the repercussion, but
we don't, we're not in that, in
that current situation at all,
Mr. Speaker, generally, Madam
Speaker, gentle lady.
Uh, thank you for that, uh,
Madam Speaker Representative,
um.
I heard that legal permanent
Legal permanent residents have
enlisted on the military that is
true because they are legal in
the country, uh, DACA recipients
only have different actions, so
for that, can they enlist in the
military?
Madam Speaker, gentle lady, um,
same answers what we just spoke
with, um, the other gentle lady
about DACA recipients have a
special status in the country
where they cannot leave the
country, so they cannot serve,
um, in the military for
selective service due to that
status, Madam Speaker.
Uh thank you, uh, Representative
Madam Chair, uh, selective
service is different from
military service they only have
to enlist if in case uh we run
out of soldiers on uh.
Worst situation.
Madam Speaker, uh, gentle lady,
it would apply to military
service, selective service, etc.
DACA recipients cannot serve in
the military.
Thank you for that answer. Well,
for that, um.
Represent Main chair I cannot
support your bill as DACA
recipients, I mean in the
future, uh, probably cannot uh
um.
Be approved for this um.
We say it um.
Jobs, yes, on law enforcement.
There is further debate, gentle
lady from Bernna Leo Sibela,
McKinley, Socorro, San Juan, and
Valencia, representative of
Beta. Thank you, Madam Speaker,
does the gentle lady you yield
to my friends from all those
counties. Thank you, Madam
Speaker, and thank you gentle
lady. I heard this in judiciary
Committee and I wanted to speak
on behalf of serving a rural
district as well as serving a
multi-cultural district and just
the need that we have for law
enforcement in in District 69.
I wanna extend my much uh
appreciation to the sponsors for
this because it's a creative way
to have law enforcement in our
communities, serving our
communities, and I certainly
appreciate it and I urge all my
colleagues to please support it.
Thank you very much.
Seeing no further debate later

supplemental calendar number.
4
Yes, Mr. Speaker, would you get
me to that point? a place in
Senate Bill 197 on final passage
has been taken and it is subject
to debate substitution. The
gentleman to explain the bill
Mr. Speaker, this is really the,
the bonding of EMS revenues, we
already do it with the, the fire
fund, and we're just trying to
align it with the EMS fund to
where we can get EMS to bond
their money so we can buy
ambulances at a cheaper.
Uh, more affordable price. And
with that, Mr. Speaker, I stand
for questions.
gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker, I move that Senate

and Natural Resources Committee

Re respectfully submitted Sherry
De Luhansson at chief clerk.
Gentlemen from Bernalillo,
Representative de la Cruz.
Are you ready?
On item
It's 4 o'clock. I need to wake
up.
You a lady from Santa Fe, Mr.
Speaker, I move we go to that
order of business. 3rd reading
of legislation.
You leave from Santa Fe. Are you
ready and item number 7 on the
supplemental calendar.
Representative Lujan, Mr.
Speaker, can you get me to that
point?
I reflect that all action has
served for place in Centerville
290 is twice amended and final
passage has been taken, and it
is subject to debate amendment
or substitution, gentle lady to
explain the bill.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, um.
The the simple bill just will
allow um to raise marriage
license fees in our county
clerk's offices and with that
I'll stand for questions.
I think there is no debate until
you said it's a simple bill.
Those are famous last words.
Even his last words, Mr. Speaker
and Lee Senator Brown to debate
this simple bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I love
simple bills too, so, um, well,
the gentle lady from Santa Fe,
please yield. I will yield, Mr.
Speaker, to the gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, just,
just a little comment, uh, no
questions. I
In uh House Appropriations and
Finance Committee, uh, said that
my position on this is that uh
for um for good public policy,
we ought not to charge for
licenses for, for people getting
married and um I think it it
would uh strengthen the family
and um I would think we could
find other ways to uh pay for
those, uh, the cost of those
licenses so for that reason, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I will
vote against the bill, uh, just,
just so you know thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Speak.
Thank you, gentle lady, I
understand.
There is for the debate. The
gentleman from Otero,
Representative block.
Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker.
Would my friend from Santa Fe
please yield. Mr. Speaker, I
will yield to the gentleman.
Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady from Santa Fe, so I
also.
Join the good lady from Eddie
and Lee because I saw this in
our committee, and I had the
same concerns about raising the
fee. What percentage is it
raising the fee from the
previous.
Current fee, I guess. What is
the new fee?
Mr. Speaker, General, and let me
see if I can get my expert to
come in. I was, uh, quite
honestly not.
Uh, prepared to, I, I'm looking
for my folder and I, it's not on
my desk, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, but it's a minimal amount
that would give um a certain
increases to the the county
clerk's office and also to the
the child uh child fund.
gentle lady, I mean, gentlemen.
No, you're fine, Mr. Speaker,
thank you. I, and I don't, I
don't even know the figure
either, so I just was wondering,
but I know it's, I think it's
about 30 bucks or something.
It's going well, it was uh it
was no fees haven't been raised
since the, uh, I believe the
70s, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, and
this would bring it up to $50
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
Yeah, it's been 35 years since
it's been raised.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and I think we were joking
in committee about how uh could
30 bucks keep you from marrying
somebody and I'm pretty sure it
wouldn't because that would be a
really
bad place to form a marriage
upon if it was over $30. So, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I do think
that we shouldn't be raising
fees. I think there would
probably be another good way to,
to find money for this, but Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I guess
I'm just gonna leave it there,
but I can't support it just for
those same reasons, and I think
other members of, of the Senate
chamber also had some of those
kinds of principle, uh, votes. I
think it was even the leader,
the Democratic leader of the
Senate voted against this
because of that, but Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady,
thank you for, for presenting
this bill and uh appreciate you
and I, I will.
not vote for it, but I wish the
bill luck, I suppose, so thank
you, Mr. Speaker. Maybe I don't.
I guess I don't wish the bit of
luck, but Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, I suppose, I hope everyone
votes their conscience on this
bill to maybe vote for it
potentially vote against it, but
I won't sway your decision
either way.
Thank you I wish I could read
your button. I can't really read
it from here, but it's OK. Mr.
Speaker, actually someone left
this on my desk a couple of
weeks ago. It says I have a few
questions and I'm, I'm wondering
who gave this to me because you
deserve a big high five, so
that's all, Mr.
Speaker.
Beaver on your desk that one
time. Mr. Speaker, this is
actually a possum.
And it
I have a I have a possum here
and I got a beaver, a stuffed
beaver, and it's, it's a mystery
to me. I don't know who's
leaving these gifts, but it's,
it's like Christmas here, Mr.
Speaker guilty as charged, so
I'll leave it at that.
Gentlemen from Catherine Gran
Valter Raas. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker, with the gentle lady
from Santa Fe, please yield.
Mr. Speaker, I will yield to the
gentleman and my friend.
Good, uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, my friend, um.
Can I ask, because I didn't hear
this, why did, why did we raise
the fee on marriage licenses.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
Um, in a
In alliance with the clerk's
affiliate with our counties,
they, this was part of something
that they've been working on and
and feel like they need to raise
those fees for some of the um
The tasks and the the the
expenses that they have in their
own offices and this this helps
do that, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, why
don't we raise divorce license
or divorce.
Divorce, uh, filing fees rather
they don't give licenses for
that, but I just thought, why
don't we raise it on divorces
and make it harder.
Keep families together, the
unit.
The family unit and make
marriage licenses gratis free.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen. I think that could be
argued both ways, um, but some
of the issues, uh, why would
they want to raise the fees or
for New Mexico, uh, we fall
behind nationally. There's 27
states currently have higher
marriage license fee the New
Mexico despite the rising
administrative costs we have,
um, the fee has not been
adjusted. It's there it is in in
over 35 years and there's
disparity in the court fees as
well, um, and there are many
other reasons.
but the majority of this is for
the administrative costs and,
and how, how those have gone up
and we haven't keeping keeping
pace, keeping, we're not keeping
pace with those costs
effectively for our, uh,
counties, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, you
know I'm not trying to harass
you or anything. I was being
honest. I, I, I think we as a
body and nothing against this
you personally, I, I, if I had
paid attention, I would have had
a floor amendment that said.
To change that word
To divorce, but I don't.
So it doesn't matter, but Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I just
wanna thank you for what you're
doing. I, I just wish, you know,
I again, I, I always want to
encourage marriage.
Um, and discourage divorce, so
with that is to thank you, Mr.
Speaker.
Mr. Speaker.
You know, for the debate, you
later close. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. I, I move now that
Senate Bill 290 as amended past
the house.
We are on final passage of
Senate Bill 290 as amended. The
vote is now open.

session.
For give me more people.
Gentlemen from Bern Leo
Representative de la Cruz, are
you ready? On supplemental
calendar item number 6.
Speaker, I'm ready. Can you get
me there?
That the record reflect that all
action necessary for placing
Senate Bill 236 as
Amended on final passage has
been taken and it is subject to
debate amendment or
substitution, the gentleman to
explain the bill. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Senate Bill 236 is a
license plate bill unlike any
other license plate bill in
2023, the legislature created
the look twice for motorcycle
safety license plate and the
motorcycle community was eager
to be able to put this plate on
their bikes. However, during the
drafting, the smaller plate.
The smaller plate.
Uh, was not included. This bill
is fixing the situation and will
allow for the creation of
motorcycle size plates.
It is not creating a new license
plate at all. It is just simply
making a smaller one. With that,
Mr. Speaker, I stand for
questions.
Seeing a debate, gentlemen,
close.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
I, I now move.
That Senate bill.
236 as amended.

board is not working.

plate.

there a motion to reconsider?
Make sure we get this vote
right. Mr. Speaker, there's a

state penalties for companies

federal standards.

Um, Mr. Speaker, I yow to the

Mr. Speaker, gentle lady. I was
just reading the bill and I'm
just wondering.
Uh, the bill says daily and
maximum civil penalties.
For a person who owns oil and
gas pipeline facilities is found
to have violated those. It
increases the penalties or does
it decrease the penalties? What,
what happens with those?
Mister Speaker, gentlemen, um,
it matches the federal
standards.
OK, Mr. Speaker, General Liddy,
and are the federal standards
higher or lower than the state?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, higher.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. How, so what's the
dollar amount per violation that
wouldn't, how, how would it
increase from current New Mexico
standards to federal standards
in a dollar figure.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, it
doubles 600 right now per day
and it will raise to $200 per
day.
OK, Mr. Speaker, General Liddy,
so did you say currently it's
600 and it, it'll raise it by
$200. Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
no, uh, it's $100 per day and
you will raise to $200 per day.
OK, so 100% increase, is that
correct?
Yes, Mr. Speaker
thank you Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, uh, so, all right, I, I
guess I
I think that might be a lot.
money. It's it's quite punitive
in my opinion, and I know the
federal standards or whatever
they are, but I don't really
trust Congress, honestly, so I
don't.
You know, usually trust congress
people and how much, how many
standards there are. So Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I believe.
FY 26.
120,000 were expecting.
To bring in
Do we know how many violations
we get annually. How many
violations annually are usually
accrued in the state.
Mr. Speak,
let me Speaker and gentlemen,
um, it does not go on the owner
of the pipeline. It was who
violates this so actually
protects the owner.
And could you repeat your second
question, Mr.
Mr. Speaker, and gentlemen.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. I'm just wondering how
many violations the state
currently gets.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
we don't have the specific
number, but in, in dollars
amount last year it was
collected 24,000.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, General
Lario last year we collected
$24,000.
Mr. Speaker, yes.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle ladies. There'll probably
be about 48,000, about 50,000
that we estimate or does it
fluctuate annually. So was that
a low number for last year
versus 23. I'm just kind of
trying to figure out based upon
how much production happens in
the state, does it increase a
lot and fluctuate?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, the
goal is not to find anybody and
it's actually to work with the
with the with the people um it
flucates every year. It changes
it's not a state, uh, it's not
a, um, it doesn't have a
specific um uh um tendency.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and I understand that and
I.
I guess I'm just trying to
figure out.
What, what a violation would
entail, I suppose, how grave a
violation would require a daily
fee. I mean, is it something
that we've sent a letter to them
and they're not responsive, or
how do we
How do we get to that?
Violations status.
Mr. Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um,
like we mentioned before, it's
always trying to work with um
with the person involved to try
not to do the fines, but in the
past years, the most that has
been collected is 300,000 a
year. OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and I, I totally
understand that.
I'm trying to understand.
What a violation required, like
how, how bad does it have to get
to be a violation? Does it have
to be filed with the PRC or
somebody, how do we
Where, where is the violation
stem from? How bad does it have
to get, to get a violation in
the first place.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, when
it's fine it's because they,
they have tried to work with a
person who violates the
standards that rule that.
Whatever it is, um, being asked
to do and it has to be extreme
and no collaboration at all
that's when it's actually being
uh defined, uh, issue.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. OK, I understand
that. I do think that the fees
increasing by 100% is a lot. Can
you tell me what the last, when
was the last time we raised
these fees.
doing now?
Mr. Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
nobody has been really a long
time.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, a really long time.
OK, I'm gonna assume it's
probably over a decade, maybe,
is that?
At least correct maybe Mr.
Speaker and told me probably.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
Madams, pardon me, I'm so sorry,
Madam Speaker right at me.
I kept on like shifting my gaze
over to the gentle lady. Sorry,
madam Speaker, my bad. I guess I
better ask a couple more
questions just to address you
correctly. So, Madam Speaker,
gentle lady.
Can you tell me a little more
about
What
Who can file a violation.
In this current.
way that we're finding
violations, Madam Speaker,
gentle lady. Madam Speaker,
gentlemen, uh, the public.
Regulation Commission.
Thank you Madam Speaker and
gentle ladies. So do they have
to
So how often do they go check
these facilities to ensure that
they are compliant.
The PRC or does the PRC contract
with somebody else to ensure
that they're compliant.
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, there
is a regular inspection and also
relying on reports. OK, Madam
Speaker, gentle lady, got it. So
the reports and the inspections,
do they do random inspections?
Do they go at a random time.
Or how did they do that
inspection process.
Madam Speaker.
We, uh, Madam Speaker, gentlemen
uh we followed the.
pipe Safety Act and this bill is
to match the fees with the
standard a federal standards.
OK, Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
I'm actually very interested in
what the standards are
federally. Are they codified in
federal law or they rulemaking?
Can you tell me that if they
are?
In law from congressional people
who passed it.
Madam Madam Speaker, gentlemen,
uh they are codified.
Got it. OK, thank you, Madam
Speaker. Thank you, General
lady, and I appreciate uh the
answers and I apologize once
again, Madam Speaker, for not
addressing you correctly, Madam
Speaker. I'm trying to say Madam
Speaker, as many times as
possible. So thank you. No
problem. There's further debate,
the gentle lady from Catrin
Sierra Socorro Valencia,
Representative Armstrong. Uh,
thank you, Madam Speaker. Well,
the gentle lady from Bernalo
yield.
Madam Speaker, I yelled to the
lady, gentle lady from the
minority floor leader from
Quechron Sierra Socorro and
Valencia.
Thank you, Madam Speaker. Thank
you, kind lady. Can you tell me
what will happen if we don't
pass this bill.
Madam Speaker gentle lady, we
won't receive um over a million
dollars of federal funding and
Madam Speaker and gentle lady,
and what does that million
dollars, uh, support?
Madam, uh madam, Madam Speaker,
gentle lady, uh, it finds the
pipe safety uh line um act.
And the division program.
Thank you, Madam Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady.
There's further debate. The
gentle lady from Bernalio and
Torrance, Representative Lord.

lady from Santa Fe.
Mr. Speaker, I mean we go to
that order of business 3rd
reading of legislation
is so gentle lady from Bern Lee
Dixon, are you ready on item
number 39 on the regular
calendar. Senate Bill 120. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. I am. Would
you get me to that point,
please? that all action
necessary for replacing Senate
Bill 120 on final passage has
been taken and it is subject to
debate amendment or
substitution.
The gentle lady to explain the
bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Senate Bill 120, um.
Permanently eliminates the
behavioral health services cost
sharing, uh, that was set to
expire sunset in 2027, and with
that, I'll stand for questions
Seeing no oh there is a bit you
from San Juan Montoya.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I got
tired of sitting down.
Um, Mr. Speaker, does a gentle
lady yield?
Mr. Speaker, yes, I will yield
to the gentleman from San Juan.
So my speaker and gentle lady, I
know absolutely nothing about
this. I was just looking at all
the no votes.
So I'm trying to figure out what
was the why, why.
What was the controversy? What
were the issues about this?
Miss Speaker and gentle lady,
and you can keep it short. I
don't need to debate you all
day, but if you could let me
know why.
Uh, that'd be helpful.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentlemen. I actually don't
know why, uh, because it's a,
it's a great bill, uh, a couple
of years ago, uh, the
legislature passed a behavioral
health care no cost sharing, uh,
bill, and uh this simply seeks
to get rid of the sunset and
continue the program, uh, which
has been, uh, very successful.
So Mr. Speaker and generally,
that seems
Like
That seems pretty um.
Hard to believe that that would
be the only reason that it would
in every committee not get.
Uh, that, that wouldn't be
unanimous, at least in one of
the committees, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady.
Seeing no oh.
Oh,
sorry, Mr. Speaker, um, uh
sorry, gentlemen, I was
conferring with my, um, experts,
uh, Senator Hickey, uh, from the
other chamber who was the
original sponsor and also uh
helped shepherd this
legislation, so.
Um, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
um,
I think some folks uh may feel
that we could wait another year
to, uh, to pass this legislation
given the amount of behavioral
health care legislation that had
already been passed this year,
um, you know, I think that
that's probably the main.
Uh
Source of, uh, reluctance,
although some people perhaps um.
We're concerned that this could
increase uptake of prescription
behavioral health care, uh,
medications, although the
results have shown quite the
opposite.
So thank you Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady. I, when I asked
that question, I had a few
folks, uh, just whisper to me,
premiums will go up.
So could you, uh,
Tell me
Why that would not be the case.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentlemen. Um, so that is
not the case, uh, and in fact,
the OSI has found essentially no
increase in behavioral health
care costs, uh, in the health
exchange.
So thank you, Mr. Speaker. I
think maybe somebody who has
been on the committee might ask
more intelligent questions than
I just did.
Um, wouldn't be the first time I
asked unintelligent questions,
uh, literally I had no idea what
this bill did. I was just
curious as to all of the no
votes, so, um, maybe Mr.
Speaker, uh, gentle lady, uh,
further questions, I will maybe
clarify for that for me. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker.
There is further debate, gentle
lady from Bernalillo,
Representative Nicole Chavez.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the
gentle lady from my Bernalillo
County yield.
Mr. Speaker, yes, I will yield
to, uh, my neighbor, uh, in
Bernalillo County.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, um, well I believe that a
lot of individuals across our
state did benefit from
behavioral health, whether it
was um inpatient
hospitalization, um, outpatient
visits just regular visits to
their, um, counselors, I believe
that a majority of people voted
against this because it would
increase premiums in the
millions for New Mexico retiree
Nipsey.
state employees, uh, commercial
coverage, the individual
exchange and so that was my
biggest concern being on the
health committee is because even
though it did take away the
office visit copay, which is
what it's mostly utilized for.
So if you look at your office
visit copay, it's usually gonna
be the price of your PCP visit,
um, especially nowadays, um, so
it's gonna zero that out. So I
kind of thought that uh 5 $10.
maybe 20 at the most, uh, would.
outweigh the millions of dollars
in premiums that it would cost
uh individuals across New
Mexico. Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, um, you're correct that
the initial FIR did indicate
that there would be an increase.
However, that was subsequently
revised to show that there would
not be, um, and providers, uh,
such as Presbyterian Healthcare,
I agree with that.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, um, knowing that
The health insurance plans do
have to pick up that zeroed out
copay. It is going to be shared
across um individuals and
employer groups, health coverage
in some way and so for that I
cannot support this bill. Thank
you.
There is for the debate, the
gentleman from Montero
Representative Block. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker, with the kind
gentle lady from Berna Leo,
please yield.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yes, I
will yield to my southernly
neighbor. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. So I was looking at the
FIRs and and the agency
analyses, which are actually
just updated after the
amendment.
And the one I saw, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
Well, first of all, I think the
OSI one was very strangely
blank, which I didn't see
anything on the OSI analysis
whatsoever. So first, I was
wondering, Mr. Speaker,
Generalleti, could you tell me
where you found that?
I believe you, you talked about
the OSI's analysis of it not
raising premiums.
Um, thank you, Mr. Speaker. um,
thank you, uh, gentlemen, uh,
that was in the FIR, uh, so the
FIR included, um, excerpts from
the OSI.
Uh, and found that, um, uh,
let's see, I'm reading the
second to last paragraph, Mr.
Speaker, uh, the Office of
Superintendent of Insurance has,
uh, has not found cost savings
or overall net neutral costs,
uh, because it's analysis was
early in the program, SB 120
would continue to benefit
patients by lowering their costs
but could impact overall plan
costs.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, thanks for that
information. It's weird because
I don't see that on the OSI
analysis. It's like a blank
document.
Says no significant issues, no
technical issues. It's 2 pages
and
There's nothing there, but Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
I believe, I, I agree, I saw
that on the FIR and I'm
wondering the healthcare
authority though on theirs,
which is updated from the, the
last analysis or the last
changes that were made, I
believe it said, and I don't
even know what these acronyms
even mean, by the way, because
it says,
Premiums, state premiums would
increase in FY 26 by 35,000.
FY 27 38,000 and then 3-year
costs would be 74,000. It says
GF via H or SHB premium.
And then down there it says
member premiums. So that's the
actual members.
Increased by 19,000, 20,000,
395,000. So, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, first of all, I have no
idea what SHB is. Do you know
what that means?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, uh,
the state health benefit.
Plan
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and I apologize. I'm not
well versed in all of the
different, uh,
Letters that we put together to
make these beautiful SHB things
so state health benefit, OK, so
I see it's an increase.
Can you tell me, Mr. Speaker,
gently, how we can
claim that this is not an
increase when I see it is indeed
an increase in premiums. Um, so
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um,
The department stated, so.
Also in the FIR, uh, the
healthcare authority states that
the state health benefit plan,
and I think you can sort of
extrapolate here would likely
maintain the policy because of
its positive impacts on
patients, providers, and the
health system as a whole, um,
and behavioral health, uh,
sorry, so based on data reported
to the OSI directly from
carriers, only 1 of 4 companies
factored in a premium impact of
1.5%.
Uh, for the remaining 3
carriers, there is no change in
the premiums from 2024 to 2025
due to behavioral health care uh
cost sharing.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. I'm sorry, which
page were you looking at that
last portion? I saw the first
one was on page.
Two of the FIR, where was the
second one? Oh thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Thank you, gentlemen.
That actually, that second part
was not from the FIR, it's from
my expert.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. I, I appreciate
that because I also see in the
FIR under what we just read, it
says, however nemesia, which
provides a healthcare coverage
plan for most school districts
and RHCA which covers state
retirees with additional
operating costs as well, so
those could go back to the
premium costs for the health
cost sharing. So, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
Have we addressed any of those
concerns? I mean, and this is a
newly updated FIR from the 13th
of this month. So Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, can you just
address that for me?
Um, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, gentlemen. Um, I
actually, um, in the time that I
spent conferring with my expert,
I appear to have forgotten your
question, but did want to share
that, uh, one of the biggest
impacts that we see and one of
the biggest positives is the
impact on chronic disease costs,
um, is lower because, um,
because we're managing those
long term issues, uh, better.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and I understand that, but
I don't see that in the FIR or
in any analysis, so I, I don't,
I, I, I love to hear that,
right, in the long term, we're
gonna save money, but I don't
see specifically how that will
go from point A to point B. How
does that work?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, uh,
could you repeat your question?
I'd be happy to, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. The first one or
the second one?
Mm
Uh, your pick, Mr. Speaker Mr.
Speaker. So first one was
different. I'll get back to
that. Second one is how do we,
how do we
How can we say that it will
lower costs in the long run when
we don't see that information in
the FIR or the analysis.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um,
that information is from a
national actuarial firms, uh,
recommendations that were sent
out to, um, states across the
country. OK, thank you Mr.
Speaker. Uh, can you tell me
more about this actuarial firm
who paid for this study.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentlemen. Uh, it's the
Milliman, uh, actuarial firm
that did the study.
And Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um,
in case uh you're unfamiliar
with my um expert witness, uh,
he's the former CEO of a
Loveless, um, health insurance,
uh, helped with the health
insurance exchange here and so
has extensive knowledge, um, in
this area. And so I don't always
have footnote citations for um
his information.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. So I appreciate
that and I do know that.
about the good senator, Doctor
Senator, I should say, but Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I'm also
wondering when it comes to
The fees, my other question.
Well, actually, I'm gonna get
back to this other question.
Milliman study, what is this? Is
it a university? Is it uh, who
paid for it? Who, who had the
impetus to create it so that we
can understand that we have data
and where can we find this data?
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentlemen. Uh, this is the,
uh, firm that wrote the
groundbreaking white paper on
this subject matter.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, General
ladies. So since it's a
groundbreaking and it's a white
paper, do we not know?
If it is
Actually a final product in
states currently have states
actually put this forward since
it's a white paper, sounds to me
like it's a very
Innovative in those innovative
stages of this.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentlemen. So other states
like Kansas and Rhode Island are
also, uh, working to adopt this
policy, so I don't think that we
would consider it, um,
Uh
New and untested.
But Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
we are getting a little far
afield from, uh, the bill. Mr.
Speaker, General Lee, I guess I
don't agree with you. I, I think
that we are not, because I want
to know the information about
this before I vote on this. So
Mr. Speaker, General Lee, can
you just tell me?
The way, the way we're all
saying that this bill is great
and, and these will not raise
costs is based on a study.
That actually contradicts the
FIR.
And the agency analysis. So I'm
just trying to figure out, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, should we
only
Consider this study rather than
All the other factors that have
been in our analysis. I'm just
trying to figure that out. Uh,
thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentlemen. That's a great
question. And actually, so here
in New Mexico, True Health, uh.
uh utilized this strategy for a
number of years, and they
actually saw a decreased rates.
So we do have a case in point
here in New Mexico with real
evidence of the successful
nature of this program, as well
as the um years that this
program has been in operation.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. So I'd have to look at
that as well, and I hope
there's, there's no one else on
the board. So I, I literally
cannot ask, I cannot like wait
for it. I cannot.
Wait for other people to to talk
while I'm trying to find this.
So, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I
guess I'm just gonna phone
friends, I suppose I'll text
some people and see if they can
find this study in the Kansas
information, but Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, can you tell me
more about Kansas? Can you guar
guarantee me that it did not
raise rates in the state of
Kansas or the state in Rhode
Island, I believe you said.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, no,
I cannot.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. General
what did it, what impact did it
have at all on those states, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, I do not
know.
I don't either, Mister Speaker.
That's the problem I have, I
suppose. So Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, we do have
information here in New Mexico
though, based on true health as
well as the years that we have
been doing this already. So as
a, as a reminder, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, what we are talking
about is eliminating the sunset
on this program. So this program
is currently in practice and
being utilized. So we do have
information and the information
thus far suggests that it would
be wise and
fiscally prudent for the state
to eliminate the sunset.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. I'm, I'm just looking at
this real quick. One moment,
please.
OK, Mr. Speaker, General Lee,
can you help me on this? So I
believe from my understanding
from other states and from this.
current, I believe we said it's
called True Health Premiums have
increased slightly because the
insurer is covering a greater
portion of the behavioral health
services. So Mr. Speaker,
General Liddy, how can we
How can we
Navigate that issue.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentlemen. Um, so,
Data collected directly from our
providers here in New Mexico,
um, and the data was collected
by OSI, as I mentioned, the
Office of Superintendent of
Insurance. Uh, they collected
data, uh, that shows uh there is
an, there's increased savings to
consumers and increased
utilization in the commercial
market, uh, and members who
received behavioral health
services avoided spending, so
avoided spending is also
savings.
Uh, in fiscal year 23, that was
over $7 million and in fiscal
year 24/8 million dollars, uh,
and just to remind you, uh, this
is data that was collected by
OSI, uh, directly from carriers
providing these services here in
New Mexico.
And Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I
don't know why the OSI analysis
was blank. They have a ton of
information.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. That's interesting. I
don't know. I, I clicked on the
link on the website under
analysis and OSI shows, well,
it's, it's not blank, but it's
the just the template
essentially says the one
paragraph that says, this is
what the bill does in one
paragraph and nothing else.
Speaker, gentlemen, and do you
actually, do we have the
analysis for the committee
substitute, or are you on the
original bill?
So Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I'm
on whatever the most current one
is, which was updated on the
10th of March of this year.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentlemen.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
ladies. So I, you were talking
about true health. Can you tell
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentlemen. So what True
Health found is after uh
beginning implementation of this
program, uh, or similar
structure, uh, they were
actually able to reduce
emergency room visits, um, and,
and other factors and as a
result, they actually were then
able to.
Reduce premiums.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, was that in fiscal
year 23, 24. When was this?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, uh, from
2014 to 2020. So actually, a
good number of years, uh, with
which to gather data.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, but it's my understanding
that True Health went bankrupt
and withdrew their plans from
the market in 2023. Is that
correct?
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentlemen. So the, so True
Health was actually sold to a
company in 2022.
So that you're not quite correct
there. OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, did they withdraw their
plan from the market?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, yes,
the new company did. Uh, they
chose not to participate here in
New Mexico.
Mm
All right. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, that, that
helps me on that one. And then,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, sorry
to get in, and I'm not getting
into the weeds. I'm actually
sticking to the bill,
surprisingly, but Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
I have some more questions about
the bill.
So I believe I'm trying to find
information here. I'm phoning
friends and everything or
texting friends, so to speak,
and they believe Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, that Illinois
mandated reimbursements of up to
141% of Medicare, which led to
higher overall insurance
premiums. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, how does that
Factor versus the state of New
Mexico when it comes to
Medicaid, uh, reimbursements and
then the premiums that we would
be having to deal with with this
new change in policy.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, uh,
could you, could you, uh,
Synthesize, summarize, uh, your
question again for me. Sure, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, so.
Illinois mandated reimbursements
of up to 141% of Medicare.
And so Mr. Speaker, that led to
higher overall insurance
premiums and reimbursement
parity policies are typically
driven by demographics collected
by
That overlook, you know, rural
areas sometimes. So, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I guess
the question would be.
I'm wondering, is the data
saturated.
At least whatever we have in the
state with urban areas then.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentlemen. So the data that
we have is statewide, so it's
both urban and rural.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
All right, so I'm trying to
figure out then.
Can you tell me what about how
this will affect the actual
insurers.
And have we had conversations
with insurers about this.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, gentlemen. So Presbyterian
has actually incorporated this,
uh, into a number of their, uh,
plans.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. OK, so do we have data
from Presbyterian when it comes
to this and how it will impact
or how it has impacted these
individuals on the plans.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you
gentlemen. I apologize. I, I'm
not good at multitasking, uh, so
unfortunately when I'm speaking
with my expert, I can't pay
attention to the question, so
it's a little tricky. I will
in the future, I will just pause
for a couple of seconds. So, but
I will remain on the floor and
reserve my right to ask
questions, but Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, uh, when it comes
to Presbyterian, do we have data
like we had with True Health
when it comes to the premiums,
and how is that affected?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so,
so I, as I mentioned, uh, much
earlier, um, 3 out of 4 of the
carriers here in New Mexico
showed a 0% increase as a
result, and the 4th, uh, had a
minimal 1.4% increase.
And this is in the commercial
market, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. So the commercial
market is usually the big, the
big ones like Blue Cross, Blue
Shield, Presbyterian Molina, and
a few others. So Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, can you tell me,
did.
We're talking about just on the
market, not on Obamacare plans,
uh, is that correct? Or I'm
sorry, we call them be well and
M or whatever we call them these
days. Speaker, gentlemen, uh,
yes, commercial plans. So, um,
if your employer has a, a plan
that you receive as a benefit.
All right. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, can you
tell me the one insurer that
increased
The premium costs after this was
implemented. We said 3 out of 4
did not, which was the 4th.
Um, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um,
I hate to name names, but Blue
Cross.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
General, and I, I guess I have
like a vested interest maybe now
apparently because I have Blue
Cross insurance.
I think I might have switched.
No, I kept it. I kept Blue
Cross. So, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady,
I know a lot of New Mexicans are
on Blue Cross Blue Shield.
plans. Can you tell me what the,
do we know how much percentage
wise people are on Blue Cross
versus Presbyterian Molina, etc.
Of the ones insured, of course.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, uh,
you're referring to the
commercial market what the
breakdown is. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Generally, yes, just
only the commercial market, not
anything to do with Medicaid,
uh, people who are on Medicaid
or Obamacare plans, etc.
Oh I'm sorry, be well and plans,
I think we call them still.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so
unfortunately that information,
uh, is actually like how many,
um,
Uh
Members, they have that
information is actually
confidential with the OSI, uh,
but there's certainly other data
that we could.
Uh, use the, the OSI has a lot
of public information on their
website.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, gentle lady. I guess
I'm just.
Concerned about the the premium
increases like we talked about
because I do see that on the
HCA.
Analysis on their, on their FIR
or their
What do we call it
So Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
thank you for the answers. I'm
still concerned and I, I wish
there were more people on the
board to ask questions while I
was searching this. So I
unfortunately have to be a no on
the bill because there's no one
else asking any questions that
would give me more time, so I'm,
I, it's unfortunate, very, very
unfortunate, extraordinarily
unfortunate, but Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, thank you for
The time and I, I wish more
people would ask these questions
so I could look at the data, but
I can't, so I will vote. No,
thank you, Mr. Speaker to close.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh, I
move that, uh,
