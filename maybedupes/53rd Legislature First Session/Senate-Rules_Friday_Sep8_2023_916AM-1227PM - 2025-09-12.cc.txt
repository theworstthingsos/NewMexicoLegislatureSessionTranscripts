to
contribute and is willing to put
himself up to this
position. Thank
you so much for coming is there
anyone in the audience in
opposition of the
country.
See none of them go to the committee
for questions that I want to start with
Senator
Stefanics.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
senator for bringing for the scan
that
missed Monday gone
in your capacity
as a member of this
commission
how.
Do you go about
responding
to decisions by
Congress to
that.
Limits or takes
away from our
basis.
Thanks for the question Senator
madam chair.
Mr vice chairman.
Of.
I I do appreciate
the question the fact that
if I may refer to
you 2
weeks ago.
I personally met
with the US senator
Martin Heinrich US senator
Ben ray Lujan they
travel to Clovis
community leaders were
invited to meet
with the
Assistant Secretary
of the Air Force for
installations
Dr Ravi
Chandra
and lieutenant general
Tony Brian fine
a 3 star general from her
aboard Air Force base who is
head of apps on here for
special operations,nd.
As you are aware.
Clovis received word
that across me 250
person will be transferred over
to Davis Monthan Air Force base
in Arizona cause
some concern with
our leadership our
elected officials and
certainly the congressional
delegation of New Mexico
so I was an
invitee to
the meeting at the airforce
base with the Assistant
Secretary the 2 U. S.
senators the
wing,nder
colonel virgin
and the 3
star general lieutenant
general for
high. And
what we did is we
gather the information of
what they had
because we wanted
to a
quiet tone
down some concerns
of the community leadership
that we're losing the base
all know this is
this is a
a start of another brac
well it
wasn't and so the
information is that you
have to have open lines of
communication you have
to talk to each other you
have to engage
and I just
commissioner will continue to be
engaged because I
am lucky and
blessed that
I can speak to these
leaders and we
were able to get a briefing
that things are going to be okay for
economic airforce base in
Clovis and
we would continue with
the operations it can and have
sock is real important we
have Melrose bombing range
there as well
and we have been
assured that can
airforce base will be taken
care of another thing that we
learned is
when president buying visited
Albuquerque New Mexico
US senator Martin
Heinrich handed a
personal letter
to the president.
About canon airport space
specifically.
And the president told the
secretary of defense
we need to take care of can Air
Force base.
So it's engagement
involvement it's
collaboration
and speaking to these leaders
in being in touch with
your local leadership as
well thank you very
much thank you for your
service thank you Mr thank
you senator.
Thank you Senator Ortiz Y.
Pino thank you Mr
chairman and and thank you Mr
Mundra gone thank you Sir
for being willing to to
serve in another capacity
in addition to everything else you
do thank you Senator
Ingle for sponsoring
him.
Does the the
the based military base
Planning Commission meet
even when there's not a
brac.
It goes on all the time
yes Sir what we
meet did we started
meeting every other month we met
in April we met in
July and now we
meet in October and
now and we select
locations were
military installations
are health or at.
So so it it really
is independent Mr chairman
and and Mr Mondragon
it really is independent of
the.
How how often or their brexit
every 10 years or
something.
Of the last
break of course was in
Clovis that we went
through I believe was in
2008
or 9
close by
their.
What I'm getting at is do
you do something besides
fighting closure of the
bases is there
another role for the
commission
besides just making sure
that the
government continues
to finance the bases here
in New Mexico thanks for the
question madam
chair.
Mr vice chair
Senator
the yes we do
a lot more than
just.
I to or expect
the brac what we do
is we
meet we
the statute clearly states
that we're there to provide
whatever assistance is
needed to
maintain
that the jobs
maintain our military
installations in our state
and
currently
I have been appointed
with the Sherman McCorkle
when Paul Cassidy
and our executive
director rich clever
to a subcommittee legislative
subcommittee to
address.
New Mexico compacts in
licensure is in the state will
be having a bill before the 30 day
session to improve
that because you have a
lot of folks coming in from
other states
that are
independent or dependence
they have licenses
but they're not approved for
the to practice in New Mexico
we want to get that change
we also
have been talking about
what they call the I did thrive
programs in our
military installations
safe and affordable housing
medical care availability
spouse employment education
and child care for also
helping address those issues
and what we do is
lieutenant governor how we might this
is the chairman of the board appointed
by the governor and we
take these back to the
governor to see how we can
assist even
in light infrastructure
in our military installation in our
state.
Mr chairman that the that's
really good I I didn't realize is
that you are involved in all of those
things well the one I was
wondering about the
is one that came up
certainly Bennett kicked if
Kirkland now
I I understand
canon has a major issue
with and I
would assume that that's going to be the
case of column and if
not already some time
soon and that
is the the
the spills the
pollution of the of the
ground water through
a jet fuel spills or
through in the case of
the chain and the
but P. S. P.
S. because
of that are you involved
in that and and trying to get them
to to the
accept the responsibility
for for cleaning up some
of the problems they've
caused thank you
for the question Madam chair
of
serve by tears
Senator of
I am on the City of
Clovis water policy
committee I serve on that advisory
board to the city of Clovis
and we have been addressing
P. false issues
are as you are
aware that the false issues
involved
214 military
installations across the country
and so they're all the dealing with
this
the P. false at
curry county is traveling to the
southeast
towards
the world's largest cheddar cheese
facility and they've been
placing filters
and yes we are
engage were involved
the last wing,nder
colonel Terrence Taylor
addressed the water policy
committee with his staff
and to what.
They were doing
currently
there is a department of
defense lawsuit
by the age scaup
form which is
a dairy farm that was
affected and they have
to put down 4000 cattle
because of that and
so yes we are involved we
are engaged and
that we are following the
progress of
the happenings there as well
X. and thank you very much
Mr chairman thank you Mr chairman
thank you by chance thank
you any further questions.
And I have a question about a couple
comments what do you find
is the single biggest issue
you face with the
military base Planning
Commission.
One of the biggest challenges
has been reported
to us as housing
and housing chairman
and so if I may expand
on that Senator
currently eastern New Mexico
university under
the new chancellor Johnson
has opened up his stores
to eastern New Mexico into
Canada Air Force base
and said we have
availability on
some of the dormitories
there we will
contract and open that
up to assist in the
housing of the young
airman
currently former
colonel Brenner
is now building
numerous apartment
complexes and has
just recently received the
RFP request for
proposal to the
military and
it will be housing
military housing there inside
the city of Clovis with
a huge
apartment complex
so housing is
been a
concern to Kaman
how we were just recently
at Holloman Air Force base
and that was a concern brought up
by the
staff director.
Thank you for that so it's interesting
that housing seems to be a common
theme when it comes to
issues across the entire
state and so I
just want to thank you for giving
us the update on Kevin there for
space the letter that was
hand delivered makes me feel better
of the future of that
base and he said 3 important
things that I want to thank you for
about engagement involvement
and collaboration because
we truly are stronger together when
we work collaboratively
for the greater good of New Mexico and
New Mexicans thank you for
that and with that what is the
will of the committee

would Mr chair

Mr motor fund to

us a little bit more information
about yourself to the committee before
I go to
the to the
audience all right
thank you Mr chairman and and
senators as
of Center do had
mentioned the ministry of
COVID county hospital
but I would be County hospital
since about 1993
and have been CEO
since 2004
and I am actually
in my twentieth
and last year right
now
and have had the privilege
of serving on the on several committees
but on this 1 I've been on it for
for several years so this is a
reappointment
and this committee
the importance of it is it gives
access to capital to
other
facilities
of some of which
Presbyterian has been able
to access capital
someone regional of
North on the list on
an awful so it's a program that
helps the entire
state
and they can get either
taxable or tax exempt
bonds loans and and
leases so it's just
a way for
and it doesn't have to be hostile see there's
been nursing homes and in the
in the state as well but it's
a way to access much
needed capital to
renew and refresh of
services and facilities
for patients
so I'll be brief which I am
actually not known for but
thank you.
Thank you for
that.
Good morning Mr vice chair
and members of the Senate thank you
so much I am
honored to actually be
participating in
and this important
council for
purposes that.
Stina compass just
mentioned
I've been the CEO at
central regional Medical
Center
just very proud of our
organization the fact that we
are serving a very diverse
community and Sandoval
County and
over the last
11 years at the hospital's been
opened I think
just being able to
understand how to best serve our
community
is very
critical and particularly
around or
more recent challenges that
all health care is experiencing
at this time
this council's important
to me because I think it helps
us to prioritize
advancing the capital infrastructure
for facilities are
much in need either through
age facilities or
or new additions
to our state
we're we're better able to ensure that
patients have access to care
which is my primary focus
so very honored to be
here and thank you very much thank
you.
Good morning madam thanks for
sponsoring that's an
Mr chair members of the Senate
committee thank you for having
us I
join my colleagues and
I guess are these as and for this
opportunity to serve
my passions as you can tell
from my bio that's always been an
education economic
development and health care
prior to relocating
to New Mexico I
worked in health care administration
in Houston with the methods health
care system for 10
years and I served on
our regional
board for
the southwestern
rehab hospital
for a number of years
so I concur with
my colleagues getting
access to quality healthcare
throughout New Mexico
is certainly a priority
and I'm honored to be part of that
so thank you for having us
thank you.
Good morning
even though I graduated from the
university of Arkansas
I was born in Clayton
raised in doing
so.
I've been around the state for
several years now but
Act Preciado the opportunity
to serve again I've been on the
board for 20 years
and I appreciate the
opportunity to serve again as
everybody knows health care is a
big. A big
part of everybody's
life today
and I look
forward to working with everybody
thanks again thank you
so much now before I go to questions
of the committee is there anyone
in the audience in support of
any one of these countries who
would like to come up and
speak.
Sure and if you can state your
first and last name for the
record.
Hi my name is Erica
campus thank you
chair and members of the
Senate I am
the administrator for the New
Mexico and hospital
equipment loan council and so
I also work with
the New Mexico hospitals as the
St and and part
of our goal is to make health care
better more efficient
easier for
our residents I'm so
in the governor's appointees
she also considered
geography so we
have appointees from all over the
state and
if the requirement that the
council B. 5 members
member of
from that community at large and
that Kerry mental
to administrators and to
bankers and the
4 out of 5 you have before
you today so thank you.
Thank you so much anybody else
would like to speak in
support.
Seeing that is there any who
would in opposition of any
of the countries.
Okay none Senator
panics.
Thank you Mr chair and thank
you all for coming forward for
this
position of
this last session
I believe it was this last
session the
governor had an
initiative for
a rural
health care fund
and part of the
language for that rural
health care fund had to
do a with
new.
Services expansion of
services or
it could be for equipment
so could any of you comment
on how you are considering
that Fund in
your role on this
Commission.
Okay so so
that fund would be able
to be enhanced by additional
funds for this commission but are
not necessarily tied together since
this would be for loans and bonds
and else
and that is that is
money
that is being awarded directly
to applicants that are
not just hospitals but health care
providers
but I think we would be able
to
participate in it to the
hospital criminal council
by maybe
matching funds if they don't get
everything that they need
SB 7 is very clear that
it is not in
acquisition of
capital a for lease
and other expenses
so it's it's going to be
an important project
to our state but it's not going to fully
make up the needs
that are are out there for
New
construction
or the capital S. need to start
programs
however I
believe is going to have a huge impact
especially in primary
care and
other programs the way
SB 7 was written is that
is going to be based on
losses.
So revenue projections on a
program and then the losses are
will be covered by that program
so it's it's a little
bit.
Are to to
use for some
entities
but I believe that we could partner with
them with any of the applicants
that that choose to reach
out to the hospital
council. So
Mr chairman and
members of the council
how will you.
Determined that there is
not any duplication
between the
applications to you
and the applications
to
HSD.
And the newest member
to this body but I would
assume that one of the things that we
could discuss as a
council is to come up with a
mechanism to ensure that
from the hospital administrators
we're hearing the full scope of
projects understanding
the various funding sources that they
are already looking at and
then making sure that there is not
explication of effort
and that the funds are going
either to
to in hands
of further the opportunity
or 2 in
sponsor
additional items that
perhaps might not have been able
to move forward to SB
7.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you all
for your responses
and for being willing to
serve thank you Senator
Stewart.
Thank you Mr
chairman
I want to also thank you for
being willing to serve
but I want to know
more about this council
I don't I don't really
understand yet
exactly what you
do
so
so if you can have
perhaps give us an example
of something that you've
done recently that would
be a more
with a little more details
so that we can understand
what it is you all
to meet
understand.
They
administrator.
There is Senator every
cent and some of our folks are new
appointees there so I'm
sorry and.
One recent example San
Juan regional Medical Center
if they needed to
refinance how they
handle their operating room equipment
which is very expensive
and to do some additions
to the hospital and
last year we helped levy the
ana with some of their construction
progress process
projects for their nursing
home I'm so it's
basically just a way to get
lower cost capital
available for these large
projects the council
is basically endorsing that
it's for the good of the public
and they're saying
yes this is true we gonna help health
care in this
community.
So Mr chairman thank
you for that but so that
you don't have the capital
yourselves
so that's
where I'm trying to figure
out what it is you're really
doing it
it's
Senator it's basically
access to the bond
market so it's
it's availability
of bonds and how and
endorsing that the
hospitals should be able to
access public
funds.
So so Mister chairman so
you're just kind of like a gateway
for like if if you
need any
hospitals nursing
homes what else
are you covering its
any health care facilities
so it could be and
anyone who's delivering care or
doing health care research
and it must be for the good
of the public it has to
be I'm an entity
that is
serving Medicare patients
Medicaid patients and
clearly is is them
delivering health template funds
cracks right so so
San Juan came to your
council saying we
need a loan
for this operating
room equipment
cetera and then what
did you do so
San Juan came to us and said we
would like access
to public funds that can
are traditionally at a lower
rate we have to
endorse as a council that
yes it's for the public
good yes they know what they're
doing with the project
that's why we have bankers and
hospital administrators who know these
projects well
and yes they should act have
access to this lower
cost capital for their
project then they
go to the bond market
all right with with your stamp
of approval yes
so do you turn your
turn people down
we M. Senator
and Mr chair we've had
to applications
in the last 2 years which is as
long as I've been the administrator
Greg might have some examples because
he has more history and
but I do not believe
anybody's been
able to get all the way to the point of
our approval where they've been
disapproved so
and you have to have your your
project pretty well together
and by the time I
council.
So Mister chairman so
so who does all that work
before you you they
wind up in front of you the
entity has to do
quite a lot of paperwork to
show you know what
they need cetera
so so but
that's not you that's
not the council it is
you know
no and Mister
chairman Senator you're correct
that the projects
initiator is the hospital
or the health care facility
and they do have to have all
that work done ahead and bring it
and presented to
us. All
right well thank you
thank you for being willing to
serve in this position
we certainly need
to have the best equipment
we can possibly
have for all of our
medical
facilities so
this is an important council
and I appreciate your willingness to
serve. Thank
you Senator
Ingle.
Thank you Mr chairman
I really appreciate your
abilities because
without a small hospitals
and small counties we
have no industrial development
all because
without a few
years.
Nothing can happen
and so I think it's extremely
important that we keep you in
a in the best way we
can as an operating entity
for the state because we're
always going to be very rural
in New Mexico.
And we're gonna
have a couple of central places
where we can get you
know the better technical
surgeries and things like that
but our doctors and our rural
areas or
without the state has no
growth potential of all
thank you for doing what you're
doing because it is very
if they're certainly a thankless
job because
you're never having
everything everybody
wants and
I live on a on a borderline
counties and we constantly
are trying to figure out where
the come to Albuquerque
for our medical
care go to Lubbock Amarillo
and the thing about it is
is it's just hard
to get in everywhere you're
going when you're from rural
areas but.
The administration of our
hospitals rural areas
is absolutely essential to
the growth that we have
and without you
all we we have no
gross
and.
I thank each one of you
taking on this job because
it's thankless
and so very
often you don't have much choice
which is to say.
We can do.
But I do appreciate your
efforts where you've gone
and what you're doing and anyway
I can help you please let me
know we the city
of quartile awesome Roosevelt
County lost or hospitals
and all of a sudden we had no
doctors
and with the major universities
there without that that the
university was basically
done and the
citizens of the county
voted by an 89
percent to tax
themselves to rebuild the
hospital
and been very
successful and
management is everything
in hospital
and we're fortunate
to have a good manager I'm
sure most of you know or
so anyway whatever
we can do to help you and
whatever I can do to help
you please let me know
because without you
we have our progress
for the status premium
thank you. Thank
you senator Senator Ortiz the
people.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
all I joined the chorus
of support
for for.
The. Your
willingness to to to do this
work on a volunteer
basis do
you is the fifth member
is it a vacancy right now or
do you actually have a fifth
member.
Members will come from the appointment
in January and that
can't corrente.
Okay very
good.
So you only need to
is that the case of Mr
chairman and members it's
only made when there is actually
a project that's
brought before you for your
endorsement.
Yes.
Excuse me
we you might need to turn
off your.
We also need to
review our annual audit
because this is a state entity
we do have a full
audited by the state auditor's
office so we need to review those
audits treaty financials
on a regular basis for the
organization and
then to review
bond ordinances or
any legal documents that are being
put forward for the to the
committee for approval by the committee
for these projects.
And just one final question
Mr chairman of
the New Mexico
finance authority has
a loan fund
and and actually it was
very low interest rate
why would somebody
come.
Do you apply for example to San
Juan come to you all
for endorsement for a
bond issue when they could have
done to the finance
authority put what would make
it better to go to the
bond market has to
do with the governmental structure
the organization so if
there are public organizations
they can go to the NMFA
and some of these are privately
owned facilities etcetera
don't and that's why this
organization allows access
to those bonds very good
thank you that helps a lot thank you
Mr thank you Senator
Lopez.
Thank you very much Mr.
And I just want to say thank you it's
good to see some of you back in front
of our committee
thank you very much for your
service
it's an important work I know our
but helped a little bit for
some entities but it doesn't
cover everybody in the state of New
Mexico and we
know we've heard on the health and Human
Services Committee over the
years
about rural health care
and lack of
access so
I believe this is a venue but it's
not just for hospitals
Mr chair but I think it's also
for assisted
living centers
because some of us are getting older
and we never know we're gonna
land up right
I I say that in jest but
we don't know but
those are all the concerns that I
know as I talk
to many who are
over that age and I
can say what age but they're
also have concerns as to
where they're going
because their children have moved out of
town so what
happens
but I also if I can just want to give
some kudos because I know
that miss Campos
and I go way back
college days and of course
fellow
Viking.
Yeah go Vikings
of it's good to see
that you know some of them ahead as
throughout years and stuff where
we are in
very good positions to make
decisions for state thank you
Mr chair.
Thank you so much no
further questions I just also want
to thank you Senator
Ingle.
A look into not get back
to.
I hope you're not gonna give any of your
capital outlay for that stuff to
Senator.
I want to thank you for your willingness to
service somebody who represents rural
New Mexico I understand
the importance of somebody who
represents a County
that doesn't even have a nursing
home Rio Arriba
county finally bonded and will
be building their nursing
home after the only
one Espanola closed its
doors 4 years ago
so I'm thankful to know that you're there is
a lifeline and that we can
call upon you would need so

committee and we're going
to be doing each
country individually when
you make your motion

comments from the
committee.
Senator Ortiz Y.
Pino.
Thank you Mr chairman and and thank
you Mr thus of its for
stepping forward and being willing to
do this.
What does the state personnel
board do this
is going
to.
Is it through this and get the quick
development of I'll turn to you
for the real stuff
Mr chairman Senator you
know we
set all the rules for
state person
we reclassify employees
we sent salary
structures
we hear appeals on
disciplinary
action.
Little bit of everything for state
employees so so you
really do have rulemaking
and and salary
setting authority
at well since I've got
you
here.
This this is
this is yes I'm
sorry I'm sorry to do
this.
We we have
over the last several
years at the
health and Human Services Committee and
I would assume you Education Committee
everybody's running into the same
thing we cannot
find.
Qualified people in the
Pacific can see rates in the
departments are enormous
the.
One little
example
to request lunch which is where
we treat
alcohol.
Operates at half its capacity
because they don't have enough
staff.
State hospital has wings
vacant because they don't have enough
staff it over
and over the issue seems to
be salary levels just
aren't competitive people can make
more working
at.
Walmart or
McDonald's then they can
working for the state
and we have a nice retirement
package but when you're
trying to feed your family that's
not your first
consideration
so I is there a so
my question all that is preparatory
to.
Is there a chance we can get
some thoroughgoing review
of our wage
scales in the personal
system and
actually. Make
it a more attractive
opportunity for people
Mister chairman Senator Pino I
will tell you that
I've been serving on that board a little over
a year now off and on
and at
every meeting we have
increased
the salaries of state
employees and it almost
every department in
the state of New Mexico
the department of health just to
the re classification
I think at the last meeting of the one right
before that
and have increased
salaries in new
positions are
tremendously
of and one of the things the
state personnel board is required
requests
is that
those departments
come back a year later and
tell us if those
increases have helped their vacancy
rates and so
far we've done a lot
we've done a lot of law enforcement
corrections
Department of Health the game and
fish you name
it we've been hearing
those reserves classification
restructured on salaries
for the last
year.
Well Mr Chairman and Mr
with us which thank you it's good to hear
that that you're grappling
with this and and that you asked
them to come back to see if
what you've done is is
succeeding I
appreciate that and I just encourage
you to to keep that
it has a we
have a huge I think we've
appropriated money for
projects or
prefer programs that
don't get off the ground simply
because we can provide
to people to carry them out and
and and it is
it's a frustration that we're all
struggling with right now so I
appreciate your efforts
thank you Mr chairman thank you
Senator
Stefanics.
Thank you Mr chair I'm
gonna piggyback off of
Senator to see Pino
and first of all thank you for
your service to
this Committee
council
board.
The legislature has had
memorials and bills
and even assigned
LFC staff to look
at the salary structure
for the entire state
not just piece by
piece and
when I have talked to
secretaries at
environment or energy
they're very concerned because
they know that they're deputy
secretaries won't last long
because they can go to the lab or
someplace else and
get almost double the
salary.
And when I sent to the
secretary how
long are you gonna stay
the kind of wrinkle their face
because they're cap as
well. And
we know that
experts in any
field could
go to the private sector
now yes they get
retirement they get health
benefits but when it
comes right down to
the value for their skill
often times
the state is sending out
the wrong message that we
don't value your skills
as much as the private sector
does so I
would encourage you to take
the message back
to the board
that.
A few people here on this
committee have
brought up this concern as
well as the entire legislature
when we've discussed at
their
and.
The other issue besides
the overall study
is. Having
worked in the state for
some years I also
know that people have
to leave
one job and
go to the next job in order to
get their own
compensation bumped
up. We
don't really have the right system
in place for good
rewards so
that might be the second issue
that you address as well.
Mr chairman the
Senator I think
we are trying to address
that this the state
personal office
in their staff have been doing
a lot of
work in the classification
studies
and
they've come back and
when they do the salary
survey said they not only
taken one within the state of New
Mexico but
around the country to make
sure that we're at least
trying to compete somewhat
of with the private
sector so hopefully
it is going to I've only been
there a little over here now
but I will tell you that is a slow
process
but we're hoping that
some of the actions that we've taken
already will
prove to successful
and and will be able to continue
to do that. Well
again thank you Mr chairman
thank you for coming forward to do
this job.
Thank you Senator
Stewart.
Thank you Mr chairman we
were all concerned about
CPO and
these issues so what
I want to apologize
also for asking
you these questions but here
you
are.
We've been blaming
CPO for a lot of things
the last 2 years.
So let me tell you
a little bit
more
what is happening
with
the
the the state personnel
office pay
bands
is that the departments
are not following
the rules
because they're supposed to
be moving people up
based on years
of experience
also
background
and so we have a
situation where some of our
departments where
people have been in the same
place for many
years they haven't moved
up having gotten their years
of experience and
so now we have a
new a pay scale
7 new people come
in and they're
making as much or
more than the people
that have been languishing
in these
suppose that steps
that are supposed to increase that
have not
so we have some
real internal
issues with our
state agencies
and and
we'll keep pointing the
finger at the state personnel
office but I've
started to point my finger
in a different direction having
heard about this
internal problem
with these agencies
so I don't know if
that comes before the
person board
at all but it it's
a crisis and several
of our agency is
chairman Senator Stewart I
will tell you that I
don't know for sure if that type
of stuff will come before the personal
board but I can definitely make
sure that we put that
on the agenda
as the chairman of
the state personnel board
and a look at that.
Well thank you Mr chairman
thank you for that Mr Dasovich
appreciate that
but.
The I'm having to do
meetings now with
state employees
who are bringing these
issues up to some
of us
and it's just really kind of
shocking to me
about how we are
mistreating
state employees
based on our own
rules not
following our own
rules so we
are having a study
this year of these pay
plans and what the
issue is and
I hope we don't
lose track of
the fact that
all these agencies are supposed
to be moving
people up on these pay bands
and they are not
so it's real price
so thank you for being
willing to look at that thank you
Mr chairman thank you Senator
Lopez.
Thank you very thank
you.
Hello.
Yes.
Testing.
Thank
you.
The magic little okay we have to
remember that okay
thank you Mr chair and
thank you Senator Stewart
those are some of the issues I was
going to be raising
also.
Some of us on this committee were
around when we did the pay
bands I
remember it very well and it
was supposed to
4 opportunity
within our departments
I mean that was the way it was sold
and how it was presented and
adopted by the legislature
then for you all as
the state person
to implement so
I'm the state did
a.
I'm the other concern
to and another issue too
is when you have vacancy savings
within the department
sometimes those extra dollars
are then used to
up the salary of
other employees who are
hired so
that's also the other what I call
movie that this happening
within our state department's
it's not something new but I think
now as senator
Ortiz Pino mentioned.
If you work in the private sector
for the qualifications of a lot
of our persons you can
go make more money any
for supporting the family and want
to move up you know the steps
in our society you gotta make money
well that's what you're going to go
and we lose a a trove
of persons who
have.
Wonderful experience within
New Mexico also
so did
if you can begin present
that prevented the chair and the board
that would be so wonderful
I'm we did pass Mr
chair also raising
the minimum I call it the minimum
wage for state employees
and we finally were able to get
that how is it being
implemented Mr
chair.
Sure this is Senator
Lopez
that I believe has been
instituted
statewide
on on the pay bands and
and the the the minimum
is there
for.
Every employee or every
agency
I can tell you that there's a
very small from what I
remember of the
the data that we saw
very few employees
that are at the minimum
wage to $15
an hour the majority
of the vast majority of state
employees are above that
and again each department
and
each.
Cabinet secretaries brought
different plans forward
with the state personnel
office on the
classification and and the
studies to compare everything
and I'll use this as an example in
law enforcement we
had.
I didn't know this until I got on the
board that
is there was
8 or 9 different pay
plans for law enforcement
in state government
of.
As of the last meeting I believe
there is now one
and whether your work for game and
fish whether you work
for of
corrections
if there are law enforcement
there's one pay plan
for for every agency
and I think that's what we're trying to do
statewide is
those classifications studies
and put people in those propane
fans.
I'm thank you very much for sharing
that in
your CPO is state
personnel office is very
important it's an at one
of the another one of the core functions
as I say the General Services
Department GSD is also
in our the court
because that serves
every entity
every agency and department
in the state.
And I know over the years always
had issues.
Still has issues
and it's just the for the core function
of what human resources
is because you're dealing with people
and I understand that
but one thing Mr chair
another concern
that we have seen as a legislature
that I have seen but also I know in
talking to other state
employees is
with regards to the process of
hiring.
You have someone that you have
qualified how
long does it take Mr chair
to get somebody
who is an
open.
On to the interview on for the whole
process how long is it taking
Mr chair now to hire
somebody.
Chairman of Senator
Lopez.
That is been an
experience for me to
understand
because one of the things I believe
in is and the way the state
government is set up
each.
Department has their own
human resource
staff they
do not report to the
state personnel
office
that was changed a few years ago
from my understanding
but I will tell you that
the the the current
the director and
the previous director have made a
big point to push
these hiring
processes
and forced and not forcing
but strongly recommended
to the state agencies
to get them done
quickly and
I think we've seen some of that
now we're
some of the statistics that we've
seen recently
shows that
from the time somebody applies
to the to the interview and
the the recommendation for
higher
it's
become a lot quicker and
I think that's something the state personnel
board can can definitely look
at
and and like I said
in being in local government
my entire career
it this is been kind of
a shock to me where
it says state personnel
office of state personnel board
but you have
each.
Department within the
state. Has their
own hiring
processes and has their
own human
resources people
are and so I
think sometimes that makes a little bit
difficult.
And Mr chair
yes yeah
it's an issue of
concern and of
course you know as a state
personnel board
I'm hoping that there would be some
more.
Streamlining I think
of the process Mr chair
I think that would be really
beneficial
as we know Mr chair each
department has their own I don
and I'm being quite
honest as to what
they do and how they do it but I
believe state person is there
for a reason.
And the role that you have is on
the board and I've said this before you're
not the only one but those who've come
before us over the
years
it it's a special
function that CPO has
and I'm hoping that Mr chair
that
the board will take heed and I know you're
with your new director
she came and I think that a year point
5 ago or so
I'm hoping that she continues
to move forward on some of these
issues to to and I've had a
conversation also
but I I'm
sorry. Mr
chairman Senator Lopez
the current director just retired
at the end of
August so we have
a new term of.
Acting director
okay I'm sorry to hear
that.
I have to
Senator Lopez because of
it I think she was
making some great strides
in in trying to get some things
done but
we've been assured that the
acting director
who is going to continue
well and I will
assure you this from my
standpoint on the board
that I will pass that on
to the other members support to make
sure that we streamline
things as quickly
as we can. No
I I appreciate that update
is too bad I mean
thankful for her service and she
is retiring to go do something else
but my gosh
but thank you I appreciate for that
update and again thank you
for your willingness to serve
in this position thank
you.
Senator
Stefanics.
Thank you first of all who
is the new or
who is the acting director of
CPO
Mr chairman
Senator.
For with names and
and I believe this
is our current legal counsel
for for state personnel
office okay
this moved into that as an
acting.
Issue thank you we can look that
up Mr
chair I remember it is
people were talking that
I was out in
on.
A field event in my
district and one of my
southern counties
and I I do want to name the
department but.
Some of the
state workers came to me
and said.
You all legislative
increase in our salaries
but we'd never order.
And the reason we never saw it
is that
someone in the department
use some of that
money to beef
up other salary so that
it didn't trickle down to
everybody
so even though
you're saying Mr chair
that.
The departments have
a lot of a Tanami
it might be wise
to
ask
all the departments to show
how all
of their employees are benefiting
so that we could maybe
take care of either the
rumor or the
fact
so just
putting out there thank you Mr chair
Mister chairman Senator we
can definitely look at that
also thanks.
Mr chair Dylan
Lange is the acting
director he was the attorney
for secretary of state for number
of years and then recently
moved of course
I.
Thank you for that and the other questions
or comments I just have a
quick comment Senator Stewart center
Lopez thank you for your comment
about performance
evaluations because I've heard
from constituents who work
for the state to talk
about merit increases not
being tied to performance
evaluations and
because there is no
reward for good work
they feel that they're punished by given
more work so they're doing
it more work for the same amount of
pay and their major
concern is the only way to move
up the state government in the
ranks is although they might
love their department of their job
they have to leave the department
for another department
to move into another rate
structure even though that might
not be the job which is
ideally fit for them it's
the only way they can see an increase
in pay and a way to move
up the ranks in state government
so I really do echo
the concerns of the other 2
senators that performance
evaluations of should be tied
to merit so that we
reward our state employees
who are doing an outstanding
job so with that what
is the will of the
committee.

I just received an
email.
Of from my constituents

they can't hear
everybody so
maybe we just need to remind
people about the
clarity and that might
thank you thank you for that
so just everybody knows
if you can speak up a little bit
louder and ensure that your bikes are
on thank you for that
into the constituents of identified
that issue we're now going to
move
on.
State.
Thank you Mr chair we're
we're gonna move on
to the
the hearing on
the for that
part of cultural affairs.
I know that there's a number of folks
who were out there we set up
an overflow room
I believe in the auditorium where
the webcast will be
streaming for
for those folks who aren't able to
make it in the room when I was a little
crowded other will be a
slight delay because as the
webcast
but you should still
be able to to
hear things so hopefully people in the
hall are hearing
that and
because we're doing well on
time Mr chair I think that
we can go ahead and
give the 6 speakers for each
side up to 5
minutes.
Very good so we're gonna move on to the
next item on our agenda
which is the department of cultural
affairs if I can have
the cabinet secretary
Deborah Garcia
he could be able to come forward
as well as your Senate sponsors
Senator Ortiz Y.
Pino wants
we're through with introductions all
start with those who are in
support I have a list of
organized support
and a list of organized
opposition as the
chairman Senator give each of
you 5 minutes which I will time
so we can be respectful
to each other's time
select members
all printed out copies
of all of the written comments
and and members of the
committee to have in
front of you copies of
both the
opposition and
support for
this country in
front of you if you'd like to reference
those as well and although the
6 on each side there's
more that you can read up
on you
may also receive this via email
what you read and so good
morning senator Ortiz Y.
Pino.
Good morning Mr chairman or
miss madam chairman and
Mr vice chairman of
good to be able to
present to you this
morning the
governor's nominate for
reappointment as cabinet
secretary of the department of
cultural affairs.
Deborah Garcia agreeable
and of.
It's my great honor to be able to
presenter
I've had the opportunity to work with
your in in
a number of issues over
the last several years
and I found her to
be very
responsive very
open very willing
to come and meet
and very willing to
of to listen
and to those are
qualities that I think cannot
be
in any way over
estimated is for their
value you
you know that this is going to be a
highly contentious
nomination because we've
gotten stacks of
letters in support
and in opposition
my suggestion is
that that indicates
somebody who's been willing to make
hard decisions it's
very easy to be
popular
and and to please
everybody if you
don't make very
many decisions or if you only
do things when when
you are forced up against the
wall to have to do them
but the fact that the department is
doing so well under
her leadership
I think is an indication
of the for her willingness
to make.
Tough decisions
not not
of hiding from
them not backing away from
making them.
And then be able to reap the benefits
of that as well say what you
see is in
her resume somebody
who is. Put
in 25 years of
work at
the intersection of
the arts which we
know is one of New Mexicos
most crucial segments
of the economy
and government
and we see somebody who is
brought.
Great luster to
the department and its purpose
3000000 visitors.
Have seen
exhibits.
Attendance is up.
Major construction projects
have been completed.
And we have a strong
force in the economy of the
state and so I think we
we have for this is a wonderful
candidate for reappointment
as a secretary and with
that I'll turn it over to the secretary
and later say something about her
own
situation.
Madam chair members of the committee
good morning thank you
for the opportunity to visit with
you today and thank
you to senator Ortiz Y. Pino
for being my
sponsor as
the senator mentioned for nearly
25 years I've been a
public servant at the
intersection of culture
and government
and for the past 4.5
years and it's been my honor to
serve as cabinet
secretary for the New Mexico
department of cultural
affairs.
In serving I have been
blessed with a

buildings and the collections
that house.
We have constructed the New

We have retained an recruited
talented staff
DCA has a 16
percent vacancy rate
which is lower than the state
average vacancy rate
of 25 percent
our turnover rate is
also lower than the state
average turnover
and we are proud that we
have a 22
percent internal promotion
right. We've
made lociceros
operational as a historic
site securing
almost 0.$5000000
in federal funding for
preservation of the historic
hacienda and
launching a partnership with
the northern Rio Grande
national heritage area

reflected in increased
statewide attendance
and revenue.
We initiated a traveling
exhibit celebrating
historic women of New Mexico

libraries senior
centers and community centers

Thank you for that I'm gonna ask
for a show of hands of those

We

Alright.
Okay so she's captured your

And so I'm gonna go

call you up to the front for you

statements you will

with the honorable Gionale
Roy ball governor of
the Pueblo of
Pojoaque.
Good morning governor.
Good morning Mr chair Madam
chair
Senators.
Okay. I am
pleased to be here today
on behalf of the public park
in support of the Rican
reconfirmation
sorry of Mr broke
Garcia agreeable
to serve a second term as
cabinet secretary for the
cultural affairs
department.
Our experience is a
secretary have proven to be
an adept and skilled
listener in navigating
the complex landscape
of our state and it's many
people and
cultures.
The secretary helped prepare
unconscionable harm to my
community through the office of
archaeological studies
by investigating their
systemically biased and
prejudiced methodologies and
attitudes.
These long predated her
tenure in our problems
her predecessors had chosen
to ignore.
New Mexico's pueblo communities
have not always received
equitable treatment by museums
and culture
institutions.
Archaeological dibuat
dig up our burials and
trying to move in our ancestors
and collections putting them
into boxes or other
archaeological
study.
We did not ask for
this. We
did not cause this what we are being
asked to correct it by working
with employees
to return what they took
from us in order to put our
ancestors back to
rest.
Beginning a decade ago we
asked the office
of.
Archaeological studies
director Eric women for
consultation
but rather than work with our
community Hughes falsehoods
and deception.
This creating an insulting
and untimely stealing our
sovereignty and appropriating
our history and
culture.
Are split over
specific.
Direction and objections
of the Pueblo he removed
are human remains and sacred
dog burials from ancestral
village sites he
was excavating storing
them and allowing reserves
ignoring the public directions
to leave them in place and not
disturb them further.
When our community approach
Garcia Garcia you
agree a goal she was not
appraised of the situation
by Dr when then how
he dug up and remove our
ancestors and culturally
patrimony and burial
objects to his
office.
Never properly accounting
for the collections and ignoring
state regulations
and seemingly misappropriating
state funds and what a place to
collections and I'm sisters
in the care of the proper
Stewart of excavating
collections
the archaeological research
collections unit of the
museum of Indian affairs
and cultural.
Indian Affairs in culture
apparently he preferred to hold
the collections in his office
where they were further appropriated
by research
and he could offer access
to the collections.
To the like minded colleagues
to write for
publication.
Further this research
also includes destructive
analysis of our cultural
patrimony and associate
burial of
objects.
This research and destructive
analysis of our cultural
patrimony were done with
permission or not
without permission or
acknowledgement from the port
Pueblo of Pojoaque is tribal
council.
Fortunately the secretary
was informed of the circumstances
made a quick and effective
study of the situation
and she personally visited
our community and leadership
to discuss our
requests for
actions and immediate
remedied and immediately
remedy to the
situation
the pueblo Pojoaque to community
is grateful
for the secretaries
leadership in ending
this ugly chapter that
reflected poorly on New
Mexico it
is our view that as
secretary she has been
settled by previous
administrations ignored
problems that has allowed
the.
Continuation of
mismanagement of
work.
And your repairable harm
to our native communities
the pueblo of Pojoaque it stands
in support of the
reconfirmation of
secretary Deborah
Garcia you can
go. Thank
you. Thank
you madam governor

Even for questions thank you for your
comments I'm next going to head to
the next person who
had signed up very
and cortices vice president
board of regents museum
of New
Mexico.
Good
morning.
In criticizing
and I live in
fort Sumner
which is a small village
in the eastern part of the state
on Senator
Ingle this
neighbor.
So of I'm so
pleased to be here
today and I am
representing the regents
and I've been on the region board
for 12 years
but I have and
speaking for the reasons today who
have given me permission
each one of them to represent
them this morning.
So first of all I wanted to say
that.
I'm very familiar with.
Senator I mean for the
secretaries work because
we look at her.
Reports we listen to
reports and we know
that all that goes through
her office because
we are very well informed
and we're so pleased about
that
she's very transparent
with us is
regents she
has not left us in a position
where we did not know what was going
on within her
department.
We know that that she has to
make hard decisions
sometimes.
But that is really the nature
of the beast of someone who is
willing to step out and be a true
leader.
So I just want to
know that we're aware
that she is in
charge of everything from
ticketing to
toilets.
And all of the
of
the
institutions this is in charge
of. And
there there are many there's
there are many many many many
buildings and all the museums
and all the historic sites
7 historic sites throughout
New Mexico someone
to speak on one of them
personally.
I can see the balls to read
on the memorial
historic site out of my
kitchen window.
Is an absolutely
beautiful building
Senator Ingle has been
there he was there when
we did our grand opening
of the exhibition.
That building was
built
ins in governor
Richardson's term
the late governor Richard since
term in
2005.
The building has been virtually
empty of an exhibition
until last
year.
Now this is an exhibition
that is paramount
to the tragic history of
fort of the New
Mexico
it the chronicles
the exodus
of the Navajo
and Mescalero Apache to the
Bosque Redondo a forced
March of
over 8000 of them
who were force marched to
fort Sumner.
Over 3000 of them
died on the
walk in over
15 of them are
buried
in unmarked graves
on the site.
This is morning wished
since 2005.
The Navajo Nation New
Mexico tribe
have been very patient.
But they have been very
overlooked
until secretary Deborah
came on board.
This was one of her first
directives
that she gave to
those who are in charge of
building this
exhibition.
Right now an incredibly
sensitive
exhibition is now
in that building.
It will rip your heart out
but is issue that needs to be
told and it's told
in a manner that is very
respectful
and very
emotionally charged
the Navajo Nation is very
appreciative of her
of her sensitivity to
this issue the most
for a tribe is just now learning
their own history.
So I just want to say today
on behalf of the regions
we do know
that
this is a secretary that
cares about all of New
Mexico.
All the historic sites feel
very
recognized.
And there's complete
supportive of her
being reconfirms
so thank you so much for letting me to
speak to you from the heart today
and we look
forward to another term
with the secretary thank you
so much thank you for joining
us I'm gonna
call forward Eric
Vazquez executive
director of the northern
Rio Grande national heritage
area.
Thank you madam chair
of Mr
vice chairman members of the committee my
name is Eric foss because I am
the executive director for the
northern Rio Grande national
heritage area we
are the only
congressionally created national heritage
area in the state of New Mexico
and one of only 62
nation wide our
mission is to protect
sustain
and promote the
cultures and heritages that
of New Mexico that makes our state
such a unique and special
place.
And on that note
our cultures and heritages
are some things that don't exist
in museums.
Or the art
galleries of taxes The
Santa Fe house or Albuquerque
there are originate
the small communities
where people have
lived.
Loved struggled
and died over
centuries it is those
communities that is the
source and
inspiration for the arts
and culture that have
made New Mexico such a burgeoning
art community around
the world.
It is those communities that is the
source of all our
of our cultural
wealth.
Yet it is often those communities
of the first to be neglected
and forgotten when it's time to
invest in the cultures and
heritage of our
state.
That is something that we were
struggling with and is
something that I will say this
secretary Garcia he could err
go out
addressed she was the first person
in a very long time to
reach out to us and
other community areas
in the rural communities
and start putting real investment
on the ground
engaging with organizations
that have been ignored
re bring it breathing
life back into
properties such as
Los Alamos and Rio Arriba
County where we are
working on projects that are
being gauging the community
driving economic economic
activity and bringing
cultural experiences
right back into the areas where they
originated.
For this reason and many
others I and my
board strongly support
the reappointment of secretary
Garcia you care about thank
you thank you Mr
Moskos and then the last
of organized support that we'll hear
from today not until
Garcia chief judge
emeritus U. S. District
Court.
Madam chair vice chair
members of the committee
my name is Lorenzo F.
Garcia and I
rise to
support the
reconfirmation
of Deborah Garcia
you Griego as
cabinet secretary.
I do not appear
this morning
as.
Of a federal
judge
for as a
former state trial judge
former judge
of the New Mexico court of
appeals for former
designated justice of
the New Mexico Supreme
Court but
rather as a
representative
of a
family.
The Garcia
family well
known a
prolific
large and I
believe highly respected
family with long roots
in Santa Fe and
Las Vegas New
Mexico.
Deborah is be
loved and admired
by the family
she's made us proud
proud of her
and her
accomplishments.
I think
Senator.
Ortiz Y. Pino for
his comments
especially about
the position
that decisions cause
conflict.
I've been on the bench for
45
years.
And I've learned
that.
If you want to be
popular
you should go sell Haagen
Dazs ice
cream.
The position of the judges
to make hard
decisions.
Every.
Decision I make
up sets half
the people every
time.
But that's the nature
of the profession
that I hear
undertaken
and it is the
nature of
being of.
N. executive in
a significant
deportment.
When.
The.
You never was a
pointed.
By the governor she
came well
prepared having
earned
an advanced
degree
at the very
percentages Chicago
point institute
in.
Or to
management.
And she put her
degree to
immediate
use when
she was hired
by the city of Santa
Fe I echo the
comments of the pro
tem mayor
of the
city.
Deborah as the executive
director of the City of Santa
fe's arts
commission
served in that position
to great acclaim
for many many years
and as you
heard. The
city was sorry
to see her leave
when she was appointed
to the
cabinet.
As cabinet secretary
she's faced both
challenges and
opportunities
indeed any
one. In
a large
organization.
Anyone who manages
a large organization
with substantial
budgets and the
number of
employees
and has a responsibility
for policy and
oversight and
management and
training and
discipline.
Of.
And beyond
that being the public
face of the
organization and the
spokesperson for
the organization
understands the
difficulty
of being an executive
in a major
organization.
I too have been the chief
judge of every
quarter on page I
have said
over the last 45
years and
know only too well
the complexities of
leadership.
Deborah as a strong
leader and
most importantly is a
strong woman
has risen to the
challenge.
She has stepped up
and has run the
deportment that
we can all
take
pride.
I respectfully ask
your affirmative
vote on her
reconfirmation.
Thank you.
Madam chair.
Vice chair members of the
committee.
Thank you that wraps up
our support of the
country The organized support
I'm not gonna ask for a show of
hands of those
who are not in favor
of the conferee and keep your
hands raised until the
committee secretary ask you to
lower
them.
Okay thank you
I'm not gonna call up each
of those who have signed
up.
In opposition of the
confirmation and I want
to start off with Dr Thomas
Wilson the former
director of the museum of New
Mexico you too will
have 5 minutes for your comments
good morning.
Good morning.
Thanks.
Mr chair enter
the committee and and members of the
committee thank you for hearing
my comments
my name is Tom Wilson
I'm a native New Mexico
my family came to Alamogordo
in 1929
I went from a go to public schools
we had a ranch in the Sacramento
mountains where I first
discovered the prehistoric heritage
of New Mexico which
I then nurtured
by becoming
an archaeologist first with a
BA degree from the university
of New Mexico and
then with of
a PhD from the university of
California
audio.
Later got a law
degree.
From the university of
Maryland.
I was honored and
still I'm honored to have served as
director of the museum of New
Mexico which before
the reorganization included
for Santa Fe museums
New Mexico state monuments
as they were then called and the
office of cultural
studies from archaeological
States excuse
me.
We all know everybody here
knows that New
Mexico's cultural heritage
is important not only to the
state but also
to the nation and to the
world.
Are you what one of you
an introduction began
saying that there is a
a lot of comments that you've
received from
numerous people
hundreds perhaps
expressing concerns about
the nomination before you
and that is highly significant
it is not limited to the
archaeological Division
it cuts across every division
in the department the
voices you hear or from
dedicated
department
public servants whose total
knowledge represents hundreds of
years of professional
experience.
Under Secretary there's been
significant turnover
in both exempt and classified
positions and the
persistent complaints of toxic
work environment and
retaliation.
I agree with.
Yes previous speakers to
say that yes if you're in charge
of a large
organization you have
to make difficult
decisions
but I think you are
I think you do that with that with
the care that doesn't
require a lead
itself to the kind of response
we've had here
for example I would I think
that at least in my
career one of the things I've tried
to do is hire the very
best from where I can
get him all throughout the
world and
then I find
and nurture them
and I it's I think it's better
if a person knows
that they have your back
rather than that you're looking over their
shoulder
it's it creates much better
work environment and you know
very little turnover
if you do that
in the in institution I came from
before here you have to get a better
job or die that's the
only way you
left.
The inability of experienced
leadership do you see
a risk chart one accreditation
from the American alliance of
museums
accreditation is the muezzin
field primary
vehicle
for quality assurance
self regulation best
practices and public
accountability
national accreditation
impacts Musim success
in fundraising
exhibitions loans and
much other things
I submit to you that the excessive
complaints about DC's
leadership puts this
national accreditation at
risk. In
addition high turnover
in leadership makes it difficult
to recruit top
candidates for vacant
positions in the department
qualified candidates will be
reluctant to
apply.
Given example that happened to
me in my previous
it as director there's a
museum of natural history
there was a woman
from New Mexico
who wanted to job at
that museum she
called me up and
she wanted to know of the
stability of the organization
she wanted to know the stability of
budget she wanted to know
whether the
turnover rates she
wanted to know
whether.
The administration above me
was solid behind
and once I was able to assure you of all
those things she took a
job and this was not a
mature woman this is
somebody who's at the start of her
career and she was smart
enough to ask those questions
and if you don't think it's somebody
that's sort of my level
is not going to ask you
know what is the record of
the. Department
of cultural affairs when you're
thinking about taking a job
they
will.
You know
the.
Donors also keep
watch of the sorts of things in
the they can be reluctant to
give now for
example just this
week. We
learned that a major donor
and a former region by the
way withdrew
2000000 approximately
$2000000 of a quest
to make music New
Mexico
foundation.
As the donor wrote to you I
think you will receive
this. Don't
let the carnage or damage
to our once beloved department
of cultural affairs
continue.
So I submit to you
that ensuring excellence in Ahlers
of operations and maintaining New
Mexico's
national stature requires
neutered new leadership
at the highest levels of the department
of cultural affairs
thank you for your patience
thank you for your time this
morning I'm listening
to go to Mr violate
Martinez the former
trustee museum of
natural history and
science.
Good
morning.
M. S. Martinez if you can turn your
Mike on you'll see an
icon thank
you.
Good morning madam
chair vice chair
members of the
committee. Thank
you so much for allowing me
to address you this
morning my
name is smile a
Martinez I
am a native New
Mexicans who grew
up in Montana Las
Vegas New Mexico
area but I have
lived in Albuquerque
for 34 years
and yes my family's land
in northern New Mexico
was impacted by
the recent
wildfires.
I served as a member
of the board of trustees of the
museum of natural
history and science
for 15
years.
From 2007
through
2022.
I was appointed by our
distinguished
and late
governor bill
Richardson.
I was confirmed by the
state Senate.
Reappointed by
governor Susanna
Martinez.
And again served
by the Senate for our
current
term.
Governor Michelle
Lujan
Grisham.
During her
this was during her first
term
administration
during my 15 years
of service I
have never felt
compelled
to take a stand in this
manner until
now. I
have always respected.
And supported our
statewide
leadership.
I am a retired school
superintendent and have
served on many
boards.
I'm here today
to tell you that many New Mexico
museum
directors.
Staff.
Board members
and communities of our
beloved cultural
institutions from
across the state
are feeling concerned
about the leadership
in decision making
at the New Mexico department
of cultural
affairs.
In particularly
concerned about the loss
of leadership in
valued
directors
and senior staff
across the state.
The staff as you
know are the most
important.
They are the asset to
any
organization.
The letters phone
calls in newspaper
articles that we
have all read should
serve to raise your
level of
awareness.
After all
they're all your constituents
as well.
This cabinet secretary
has removed multiple
directors throughout
the DCA in
a chaotic.
An unprofessional
manner as
exemplified
by the firing
of the executive director
of the museum of natural
history and science
in Albuquerque.
She had been the longest serving
director in
recent memory.
Instability and
service to that
community for 6
years prior
to that we had
had a revolving
door of directors
lasting probably no
more than 2
years.
I'm going to move a little bit from the
script and be
Frank with you and tell
you that
New Mexico is made up of
3 cultures
we all know
that.
Throughout our meetings
over the 15 years that I
have served their
I continually heard
from among us
the concern we
had that
the museum's our most
prized gems
in the state.
Our most prized
gems in the state
to not just serve
Santa Fe in
Albuquerque.
They serve.
The cultures in
the communities
in northern in
southern New Mexico
the rural
areas.
We were constantly
concerned and I
know Gary Trippin Gary
Friedman Friedman are you
here Gary Friedman
the chair of
the.
Board of trustees we
were always concerned
about how we
deliver services
to
children.
In mora if
Chama in
Espanola in
fort Sumner in
all the small communities
and bring them
to.
Embrace
the culture the
cultural affairs
department and the
services they
deliver we have
been. Really
vocal about trying
to get the services
out to our
children our
students in
rural remote
areas.
In right now I
will say.
One of the cabinet secretaries
biggest.
Weaknesses is
being able to see
this.
Being able to see
this fact.
The New Mexico museum of
natural history
probably one of the biggest
or one of the largest
museums in this
state
continually and routinely
bringing in the most
revenue.
Currently has
11 board
members.
One
Hispanic.
That makes it
0.09
percent.
Representative.
Representing
that.
That area
miss Martinez I need you to start
wrapping up your comments are almost at
6 minutes thank you very
much.
I am implore
you.
Seriously to
rethink the
reappointment of the
cabinet secretary
for the reasons that you have
heard here today
and for my comments
and I thank you very much
for giving me this opportunity
thank you of a column
Laura Lovejoy and
may former special
operations manager museum
of New Mexico and museum
of international folk
art.
Thank
you.
Good morning I'm honored
to be here with all of you thank you
so much
I'm not reading my words
I'm reading the words
of.
Tony Lomba
from Los crucis.
So and I
just wanted it on the
record.
My name is Tony long bond
I'm a former long term
employee of the farm and ranch
heritage museum in Los
crucis I have also
served as a board member
for many years after my
retirement
I have committed my
life's work to preserving
the fascinating and complex
history and culture of
our great state
I have serious concerns
about the leadership at the
department of cultural
affairs.
As one of 200
individuals who signed the letter
to the governor in February
informing her of our
concerns we
are not just concerned about
personnel actions
we are concerned about the
health and stability
of the department of cultural
affairs the keeper
of the history and
treasure of our
state.
With no disrespect
intended but to
address the confirmation
before you for your
consideration we
do not believe this secretary
possesses the capacity
or the understanding
required to be Stewart
of our cultural
assets.
The actions and lack of
management skills of the
secretary has resulted
in a tremendous loss of
expertise and
institutional all
knowledge that is
essential to the preservation
of our state's cultural
patrimony.
This also puts our national
accreditation at
risk among
the reasons national
accreditation is
important is that a
it gives our museums
access to valued loans
from other accredited
institutions
and accreditation qualifies
us for grant awards
federal funding and
private fund right racing
opportunities our
state so desperately
needs.
The churning of leadership
whether for political or
personality considerations
is a warning sign of
dysfunction and the
national
accrediting agencies
will have concerns about
the CA's governance
I respectfully implore
each member of this committee
to consider this nomination
carefully and we
ask that in light of former
overwhelming concerns
you not support this
confirmation.
Thank. Thank
you the last
person who signed up
in support and opposition
of the confirmation Dr Torrez
each this former
director museum of New
Mexico palace of the
governors.
Good morning doctor
Janice.
Mr chairman miss
madam chairman Mr
vice chair members
of the committee.
This is unusual first time of
addressed a Senate committee in
a square
room.
I hope it goes well.
I want to react to a couple other
things that were said to.
I don't represent the Chavis
family but will match the
Garcias.
And I was born in Las
Vegas I think there's 3 Las
Vegas people and 3
by valley Viking people
we got that
tied
and then
I I resented the
personal attack on
employment brought
here this wasn't
the place for that I'm
sure he was said that
you want the whole
walkie issue was not
even brought up to him
I heard you say
that.
Madam chairman members of
the committee.
I come before you out of
concern.
I've devoted my life.
But to the history and cultural
heritage of the
State.
And I'm saddened to see what has
become a
trend.
Of consistent and
open
denigration of the
state's.
Support.
I'm currently concern
for the preservation and sharing
of our heritage.
Cultural tourism is a major
industry in New Mexico
for obvious reasons
the department of cultural affairs
is its driving
force not
every state has a
cabinet level
posts like this.
Moreover in the past
the state of New Mexico
especially the legislature
has appropriated more money
per capita for this
because in any other
state in the union.
I don't know if you know there
but I was always proud to say that
when I worked here you
had an interest in what we were
doing and cultural
affairs.
So we come to the present and
find that the department cultural
affairs his phone
into its most dismal
state since its
inception
almost 40 years
ago. I
was there
and remember when it was
division of
the department of
education.
Now staff
morale does not
exist there are
less programs
libraries and archives
are closed to the public
vacancies not filled
some for almost 2 years
incidently.
And the CA's
failed reorganization
has resulted in a top
heavy monolith
which might explain his
handling of
through the higher pay grades on
average would have not
reached the worker bees
the curators
conservators the
archaeologist
monuments Rangers
secretaries receptionists
janitors and security
personnel.
The only positive voices come
from the administrative
top. Have
you not wondered about the silence
of the staff they're supposed to
support.
Attendance is up we're
told well
with rock concerts
maybe.
And after the COVID years it'd
better be.
But then who was counting.
Anyone attend a free
concert at the NH C.
C. national spent a cultural
center.
See anyone counting
their has anyone
noticed was counted in the
museum's.
To the given numbers match
the admissions revenues
beyond small
matter.
Then we have the delayed announcement
about the creation of a tribal
areas on the Queensland
Lee came out within
a week of this meeting
it seems that the department of cultural
affairs is trying to spend
its way out of
reality.
Speaking of revenues
has anyone bothered to ask
the foundations who try to
raise money in support
of our cultural institutions
fund raising is
down.
This is put the burden on the
staff Ford is
them and not the
administration who write
the grants as a
result the production of large
grants has slowed
because of the over abundance of
staff
vacancies.
Madam chairman.
Mr vice chair members of the
committee.
This important committee.
For more cultural affairs
is sick with the melody.
Which incidentally has spread to
the state archives
in the historian's office
both of which Lane DCA
have been denigrated.
This illness
this bad trend
can only be cured by 3
sources
you in the legislative
branch the executive
branch and private
support.
Without one or both of the first
to the third
become commute.
Status quo is not
an option
not now.
Our state deserves
better.
The opportunity to reverse
this trend to
start the healing process
is before you
all of
you.
At this moment you
on this day.
Make up important
decision.
Finally I want
to take this opportunity
to thank you in advance for
your seer consideration
of this issue.
Thank you for your comments the those
are who signed up
in organized
opposition and I can take
2 more to keep it there
on both sides is
there anybody else who rose up there
had opposition of this confirmation
would like to speak.
If you can come up and state
your name first and last
name for the record
you too will be given 5
minutes.
My name is Theresa Gabriel
and I live now in Los
crucis for many years I lived
in Santa Fe.
I worked for the department of cultural
affairs for 28
years it's a long
time.
It represents a lot of love and a
lot of dedication
I started out as a staff
classified
staff member
at the arts division
I was there first grants
coordinator I
became eventually
of the division director
Is and served after that
as the budget manager for the
entire agency.
I also served as the
international programs
officer in created
that program with Mexico
and Spain and the
native Americans.
We still today Tim
Maxwell and myself
get calls from Mexico
we designed that program to go
for a long term
not a ton of money
but to involve students
and to try and
understand the different
methodologies that went back and
forth between the 2
countries.
Credibly successful program
the Peabody museum is still
calling to him to
try and help them what the
problem was because
of
this.
And all the years that
I have served
and 20 it's a
lot.
And I'm probably count as a statue
in the park let
me thank all of
you there are many of you that I
now have served for a
long time.
You've given is given a
lot to the state
and I appreciate that
fact.
I've never seen
a situation and the 20
and all the years that I've
was there and I've been was there
through all of.
All of the secretaries
through Stuart
us.
And I've never seen this
much
opposition
this much
concern.
This much
turmoil.
And this much
heartfelt.
Grief and I
certainly agree
with the fact that no one
should have been attacking
personally
anyone who is not here
to defend themselves.
And the other thing I would point out about
the office of archaeological
studies is that the
people that make those
contracts.
Our only just does not
make the contract
the highway department has the
contract with the
public.
Just merely serves
it.
That is not to say there shouldn't
be communication.
I've got that.
But the highway department
is the other big piece of
this.
Before we blame
I just and Eric
limit.
No one here
and I know that cultural
affairs can
be a royal
headache it's
amazing the things they get
into.
Really it is.
What I also know in
the arts or bridge
between cultures between people
between countries.
23000 years
ago we have evidence of foot
prints going across
Alamogordo and white
sands.
That chapter isn't written
yet.
And so that's something for you to think
of. When
you make your decision
today.
And again I
truly I respect so many
of you and I know
quite a number not all of you by
any means but a number
here and I've known you for a long
time and I
certainly would commend
sponsor for
what I think in the area of mental
health has been extraordinary
work just
knock out.
So with that said thank you for
listening thank
you for being here.
Thank you for your gracious
service I appreciate that
very much
thank yes No.
Thank you I can take one
more who's willing to speak
in opposition
sure if you can come to the
Mike. Make
sure you state your first and last
name for the
record.
Hello Senators thank you for
letting me talk my
name is Dr
Barbara.
And my last name is a
German name confuses
everybody lower
case 8:00
AM
space
capital E.
N. D. E.
and.
Thank you
so.
I'm maybe possibly the
mistake of leaving New
Mexico back in 1989
and it took me 27
years to move back to my beloved
land of enchantment
since I've been back I
have been passionate
about
archaeology
and I'm only an amateur
archaeologist my field
is something else and
so it's been a
gradual growing and
I've tried to give
back to the community of
archaeology
and do something
for the field for the
people for
everyone and
I've belong to
organizations I've taken
classes and so forth
and as I've gotten to know some of
the people in New
Mexico.
Thanks volunteered for
some things and they started
to call me up and asked me
can you do this for me
because we don't know what's happening
here in Santa Fe
something we might be forced
out of this they won't tell me
what I don't know what
they are all you know
is that there are a lot of people
who are scared to death
and.
It seems to me I got
to thinking about this while I was driving
over not knowing that I was going to
talk.
An expression my father used
to use was this is a heck of
a way to run a railroad.
What does this where
people are scared and don't know
what they can do for their job
what they're not allowed to do and
that they have to just grab new
be volunteers
to take care of things
and I think there's a real problem
here and I
think.
Obviously.
There have been
the candidate has
had
some.
Successful thing she's
done a lot of people
like her and
I'd no person
is all bad and obviously she's
done some very good things
but I think there's some real problems
that need to be investigated
and I think we've also heard
enough
reliable.
Professional people who
do have opposition so that
really says something and
that is why I am here to
oppose.
The nomination I don't
even know the the per correct
not terminology
but that's all I have to say
thank you. Thank
you for your comment so that wraps
up both the
support and opposition I am
now going to go to members of the committee
starting with centers to
fax.
Thank you Mr chair
thank you senator for presenting
the
secretary.
Madam secretary thank
you
talk a little bit you
mentioned in your
statements that
you have been able to work
with all the tribes in terms
of libraries
and getting them
12 so that they
are eligible for grants
so my attached
question to that
is. Are
we doing the same for all the
rural communities that
don't have paid
staff in
libraries.
Madam chair members of the committee
senator and that when I
guess think about
that Senator Stefanics
yes so I was referring
to the
chapter houses on the
Navajo Nation
they have been served
certified as developing
libraries which
opens up
funding from the tribal
library endowment
along with developing
library resources that
are available to any library that's
a developing library
so up rural
libraries libraries
in general role library services
are a personal
passion of mine
I have to say
when I took this job and
found out that New Mexico still
has Book mobiles
I adored but no bills as a child
so
rural libraries are
part of that
with with a great deal
of advocacy from
the gentleman Senator sitting
next to me
that rural librarians element
is now at
$28000000
we will be doing in our first
disbursement to those
rural libraries this year
as was mentioned
the goal is to get that
rural indirect rule
librarian Domon to
$50000000
and the point where it will spin
off $100000
to each library so
that will be enough to pay
roll libraries for
for staff
so Mr
chair madam chair I'd like
to. Take
this the next step
what
qualifies.
I have several
rural libraries run by
volunteers and
they have
indicated
that they don't
qualify to apply
for grants so
what are the
standards
to allow
a rural library
to apply for
state funds
Madam chair Senator Stefanics
members of the committee
I'm. I have
wonderful talented staff
who will have all of that information
and I cannot answer that question
in detail what I would
say is that they can reach out to
me here in like in a
to get the information about how to
qualify.
They should be able
to if there are
are a certified
rural library through the
state library they should
qualify for the funding of the
resources available
if they are not if they are
developing library they
should still also
qualify not
knowing the library's not knowing the
circumstances I really can't
speak beyond not
but it is we
have dedicated staff out
the state library
whose job it is to bring more
libraries a special in rural
and tribal communities online
and I would be happy to connect
any constituent to those
resources.
So madam
chair. It's
not going to be my constituents is
going to be me and
if you're making this effort
with the tribes or the chapter
houses I
would like those efforts to
be also for these
rural communities that
are just being run by volunteers
that have been in existence
more than 3 or 5 years
so I think
this is something to pay little
attention to sell
then chair my next question
madam secretary
is. All
of your museums have to be
go through some kind of certification
or accreditation could you explain
that yes madam
chair Senator
Stefanics members of the
committee
what Dr Torrez
was referring to is the American
alliance of museums
they are the nationally
recognized accreditation
body
and in order
to receive
loans
to receive technical loaned
art to receive
technical
expertise and all of the services
that that offers accreditation
is required and
so the
various museums are
accredited separately
or together depending so farm
and ranch has its
own accreditation
space history
natural history those
are credit separately
the 4 museums in Santa
Fe are under one
accreditation
as we speak we
have reviewers
from Hey
I am doing what's called the
museum assessment
at the natural history
museum
they are almost over the
hurdle of re accreditation
we should probably have a letter by
the end of the fiscal year for
reaccreditation for that
next step will be farm and
ranch so within
the department we have a number
staff who are certified
a and accreditors they
go to other museums
and do accreditation assessments
and visits so
in anticipation of farm and
ranches reaccreditation
we have an internal team
come and do
a a photo
accreditation
so that that museum can
focus on some areas
to ensure it's in good shape for
reaccreditation
next up I believe will then
be space history
and then the
Santa Fe museums
the Santa Fe museums all of those
division directors are already meeting
to get up to date with
our culture court
documents
so they're updating those
I think looking at
reaccreditation I actually
think we are in very good
shape again we have
the internal accreditation
reviewers to do other.
Museums we have a great
deep bench of knowledge about
what that's and
require
we are
we we'd attend regularly
they am
accreditations
the staff turnover at that
the director positions
is actually
not any
different than it was in the
first 4 years of
the prior administration
we've turned over 7
of those positions the prior
administration turned over
6.
Good knowledge in
that mass
and sudden leadership
change is
problematic to a
Kermit accreditations
when I came into
this position
DCA was the
only agency
statewide that
maintained any of let's
go back stuff
our relation our retention
rate between the prior administration
and this administration was
100 percent.
So we with
those leadership changes I think
we're gonna we're those
can be managed
the other area that I.
I'm just asking about accreditation
yes. Like
more I'm sorry how often
is a museum have to be 12
for 510
years I
believe it is every 10
years okay
so now I'm going to ask a
question or you might go
off on that
directors.
Okay your organizational
chart some of the comments that we
received has
been that a
couple of
museum directors
have been set up to supervise
other museum directors
and
I could see that
that could be a morale
issue if that occurred
but could you tell me
the question I'm asking is could you
tell me the pay scale
of museum
directors.
Madam chair
Senator Stefanics members
of the committee of
my museum
directors are making about
115000.
Okay and so there
are according
to an org
chart about
8810.
C. H.
2468.
101214.
1516.
This.
Chair Senator Stefanics
1516 what museum
directors.
No madam chair
members of the committee Senator
Stefanics each
museum has a
director so there are 8
directors plus historic
sites that is
9 and
then there are
for
non there
for service agency
directors of a total
yes I have a total of
23 go back
stuff.
Okay thank you Mr chair I'll just
wait to hear other people's
questions thank you madam chair thank you
Secretary thank you Senator
Stewart.
Thank you Mr chairman
the thank you to everybody
who she shown up to
date that the difference between
today and yesterday is pretty
significant we had no one in
the.
We thought we were fully prepared
obviously we were not
so
but it speaks to the
importance of the
secretary that people
have shown up
so madam secretary I just
want to give you
the chance
to respond to
some some of the
criticisms whatever
you want to respond
to at this
point I'll tell you taking notes
so what I know
you have something to say about
them so I just
want to give you that opportunity
to respond some of that
criticism.
Madam chair Senator
Stewart members of the committee thank you
for that opportunity
yeah I think
one of the things I
would like to respond to
is the notion that there has
been excessive turnover
and excessive vacancies
within my
agency
that is simply not
true according
to the data
particularly when it is
compared to
relative performance
statewide as I
mentioned in my opening
remarks are
vacancy rate
is lower than the statewide
average and our
turnover rate is
significantly lower than the
statewide average
I am unaware
of any
position that has been
held up
for 2 years in
less it is going through some
form of re
classification
so as the
the chair the state personnel
board was just here before that
that can take a process I
personally have a great
respect for CPO and find them to be
fairly responsive that requesting
a position take a
while
we can fax of
last fiscal year
set a record
in hiring
for the
department
and it has been a priority
of mine to make sure
that every position that we can
get filled as an active
recruitment so
I am I'm a little
perplexed then as I was beginning
to mention the
turnover in leadership positions
is actually not
unusual for this agency
and it's certainly not unusual
within the context
of every other governmental
ex employee was let go at the
beginning of the
administration
I am also a bit
confused by
the
re organization
that has occurred I believe
without is referring to is
when I stepped into this
role I looked at the org
chart and I have 22
direct reports.
Anybody that looks at any
basis of
management and effective management
knows that thought as well
beyond
a span of control in a
direct report structure that
is best practice
so I did
implement
I did find
small increases
to a couple of
museum directors
to help with delegated
administrative tasks
related to some of those direct
reports and what I mean
by that is things like
approving
timesheets
Lee
helping to problem solve
this as sort of an intermediary
problems all to try to take care of
our problem before demand in my
full attention
but those were all very soft
reports they were not direct
reports I'm meeting
with every single one of my division
directors at least once
a month. More
likely every 2
weeks and I have a couple of
newer ones that I meet with
every day
as a leadership team
we have a weekly hot also
we meet weekly and then we meet
in person every
quarter
so I feel like
there's very good communication
between me and my
staff I feel like
I am exceptionally
available with
the exception of a few people and you can
guess who those are
they are next on my list
for if the cell phone goes
off I answer the
call.
I expect people to return
emails in 24 to 48
business hours and model
that behavior myself
I set aside time every
day to ensure that any paperwork
that needs my review on signature
is done because I've
worked in government for so
long I know the places
that things get held up
and I never want to be what is
stopping one of my leaders
from moving something
forward.
I also want to respond
to the session that
fund raising is
down
hi
respectfully disagree with
Bob and the numbers provided
by any of the foundations
would demonstrate that that
isn't true
the museum of natural history
has had a record breaking year
particularly are
specifically in their
shops
in my opening remarks I mentioned
that we just completed a
$20000000 building
in partnership with the museum of
New Mexico foundation that was a
5050
partnership
so I do think
we you know leadership
changes both
within an agency
but also within a foundation
can cause
you know some dropping off and
grants or foundation
support but I think generally
our foundations are performing
very very
well
I also would like
to point out that I am not
responsible for the make up
of appointed boards that is the
governor's prerogative
so I have no control over
that I think
my opening remarks
and everything that I sent
indicate that I take
seriously
serving every
community in
the state.
It is now a joke among my
leadership team that
when I was appointed
division directors and divisions
from other parts of the state
sort of let out a collective groan
because there point in the Santa
Fe girl it's gonna be all
about Santa Fe.
And I made it a point to
spend as however long
I'm in this chair
proving them
wrong.
What I love about this job
I loved my job at the city I think
the council may not very clear
what I love about this job is I get
to experience all parts of the
state I've made it a
point to be out and
about in other areas
of the state on a consistent
basis
I listed during my
accomplishments a number
of programs that are aimed at statewide
service delivery I take
that very seriously.
And I think that's probably enough
thank you for the opportunity.
And thank you for those comments
so. I'm
gonna ask you a question is
totally.
Out there
at and and
you may not be able to answer it
so. A
number of years ago
the governor put in
place
a paid family
medical leave
provisions.
Have you noticed
in your
department
the use of that what
sort of been the use of
that has been a
problem
can you give me any data
about how your
department that
uses that
provision if you
even know maybe you
don't.
Madam chair Senator members
of the community thank you
for that question I
don't have hard data about
that which is what I think you're looking
for but what I
do know is
we have had employees that have
used it it
is
incredibly important
to them that they be able
to spend whether
they are father
mother adoptive
parent that they be able
to spend those first months
with their child and
that they know that they have a position
and they have
salary to come back
to
and so I personally
think it is a huge
component of retaining
qualified staff in
any agency in the
state
and I also
worked really hard
when a parent is
coming back you
know something an
infant doesn't suddenly change in
3 months
and as a mother one of the
hardest things I ever had to do
was come back to work.
And so we work really hard to
help them transition back
into the workplace as
well because it's
a challenging period from other and
for child and for
employer.
Thank you very much for that
I don't I don't want a hard data
I want some data
about what's happening
so you've you've given me that
so thank you very much thank you Mr
chairman.
At chairwoman Duhigg.
Thank you Mr
chair.
Thank you Secretary and
Senator.
I have a couple questions.
I I heard
the.
I've I've heard a couple times a
suggestion that.
It lonely looks like the numbers
are good because this is
because we're coming out of COVID
for for attendance
how do
attendance numbers these days
compared to pre COVID
numbers.
Madam chair members of the
committee
fiscal year 2023
in the just shy of
fiscal year 2019
which would be the last full pre
pandemic here.
And we track that
I didn't mention in my remarks
but we have implemented
a statewide ticketing
system it's called
tessitura
every facility around the state
uses that makes
tickets available online
a point of sales and that is
how we track it it's a
system that's used by the Santa Fe opera
the lands that gets the gold standard
of ticketing system.
Thank you is that so I I
also thought I heard a
suggestion from from one
of the speakers in opposition
that. That
ticket revenue doesn't
match attendance numbers
so how and
and maybe I misunderstood
that but
how.
It how would you track
that and and is there an
indication that that
those numbers don't
correlate madam chair
members of the committee we
track it using this tessitura
system which
then pencils out on areas
decide to revenue that
is how we track at every
ticket is unique ticket that is
sold from the
system.
Is there an indication in your
system that.
The revenue being taken for tickets
doesn't match the number of tickets that
are going out
madam chair members of the committee
now.
What.
What are are you
doing now
or are planning
to do in the
future
to ensure that you're incorporating
perspectives
from staff at various levels
of the department
and to to cultivate
a collaborative environment
madam chair members of the committee thank you
for that question
as was mentioned in my mark
remarks the thing
that I'm most proud of is that department
wide network of
educators
that grew out
of the darkest days
of the pandemic when
our statewide educators
started simply getting together
on the zoom and
meeting and sharing
ideas about how they were
going to continue to serve
particularly school children
as they adjusted
to this weird world we
suddenly found ourselves living
and all of that
work all of those
ideas have
come up from
the staff and they've
been brought up through the terrible
education and engagement elected
may
to senior leadership
and we have gone out and gotten funding
for those ideas
so we are not using that
model with
our exhibit staff statewide
so we're convening all of
our prepares
exhibit designers
fabricators
installers to get together
and simply talk
share ideas
I have this resource I
have this one
and we will do the same
process where they can bubble
up the things they need to do
their jobs better to be more effective
to better service we'll go
out and seek funding without
and then we're also doing the same
things with all of our deputy
directors.
As a leader what is really important
to me as a team environment
in the sense that
somebody always has your
back and it's great to
have that at the top but you
also need that and rank and
file employees
I'm also
starting to puzzle
out our
security guards and our customer service
staff and
how we're training them how
we're having them view their
role in
ways that we can empower them
there some great examples around the
country of where
guards
have curated exhibits
I mean there and those calories all the
time they know the collections
better than anybody else they
engage with the visitors
so we really need to start
shift in how we
view our guards
from being
you know.
Enforcers of rules
to be in customer service so
that's the next
idea but I want to get their
thoughts on what they need
so that's I tend to
convene groups by classification
or by like work
where I can I will have a
member of the leadership team
oversee that work
and then we talk
about it we identify
the good ideas and
seek funding to get it
done.
Thank you I I really appreciate that
answer.
All all state I
tend to agree with Senator
Ortiz Y. Pino that
if you're doing your job right that's probably
going to be people who are going to be mad at
you no matter what you do
and I and I want
to echo Senator
Stewart's
thanks to folks for
being here today I mean I I it
really is
I. It
makes a really big impression
seen folks who are willing
to take time out of their
day to
come weigh
in on these
important
positions.
And and while we
we've got we got a lot
of input both
in favor and and
opposed.
Kind of amazed at the
back of of documents
here but
but but it it
it does make an
impression on me
that there are so
many people and support who
are here today who are taking time
out of their day
to to be
here and I know
there's a lot of people who who have
concerns as
well.
I I I
appreciate the.
Every time and attention
and the
the work that has
been done in this
department.
Mr chair thank you Senator
Paypen.
Thank you Mr chair thank you
Secretary for your willingness to
serve I know these positions are
difficult
I wanted to echoing
thank senators to phonics for
her comments of the library
of had.
Much of the same
input
Mr chair and and
secretary regarding
I'll say
some of the more rural libraries
being all quality can
ordered and
us would really like to see some
of that rectified
at least given some attention it
appears sometimes in the state
that
Mr chair is that
we're we're focused on Santa
Fe and Albuquerque too
high to create and
we forget that there are
0.5 of the population to
live outside of those areas
and so anyway
I'll going to a couple questions I
think we're we're we've been
missing just due to the
the people that are here and
who are not here Mr
Chairman one of them is political
contributions and
so I will ask you
have you donated to the
governor.
Madam chair
Senator Baca members
of the committee no I have
not. Either
this term last for madam
Mr chair and and
secretary.
Mr chair I did it
donate I'm sorry madam
chair Senator
members of the committee I did
donate to her reelection
campaign. Thank
you for that answer
I want to talk a little bit too
about a some of the
reorganization I know we beat
this thing up pretty good
and is it madam chair for
Mr chair right
now.
Okay so.
So Mister
chair.
Within their of it a lot of
the complaints in the in the letters
were repetitive and they
talked about of these
division heads
you say there's 22 so
many of the letter said
Mr chair that there were 15
division heads
and you parse that out
into
to all call in supervisory
roles which they refer to
as chairs of these
division heads
um.
Can you tell me and I
heard you say there's a lot of people
reporting to you you know I I
understand that Mr chair
which it overly burdensome
to have those people
continually wanting
to speak to you is that was just a
time constraint thing
was what was your reasoning
for doing that.
Mr chair with my
apologies
Senator and members of the
committee
when I first took on the
position you know you're drinking
from a fire hose
in a situation like
this and so it
was a way to control
the flow of information
I still met with
everyone of those division directors
on a regular basis
I think there is some outdated
information out there
there's no longer 2 chairs
over to for the
museum's apiece
there is the chair
of history
and heritage who
oversees the
history museum of
space history museum
farm and ranch and he is the director
of historic sites.
That has really
morphed into more
of a peer mentor
role than any
type of supervisory
role.
The chair of
history I'm sorry arts
and science took another
position of the getting Institute
and so
to.
It knowledge and empower the
work that was
being done with this education
group I created
the chair of education and outreach
so that person actually doesn't have
any division directors reporting
to him as I've
adjusted to the position
I I ate which
part of the reason I did away with that
is I'm I feel like I have
a pretty good
report with all my division directors
I feel like I have a good sense of what's going
on and all the divisions and on the
ground I feel like it's
become routine to meet with
so I'm much more in direct
communication with the non that
role has really changed from what
it's been described are discussed in
other places so so Mister
chair you're saying that
essentially these are
you told me a chair
to chairs do
exist
I am my question I
guess than that
and and you stated it yourself
I think you said control
information flow
that that has been the
complaint levied in many
of of a in the
of the opposition letters that
I received Mr chair and
secretaries that
that there is
certain interests certain
request
certain
certain
information that's being vetted
along the way and
we as human beings I think
Mr chair and secretary tend
to push our
own interests at times
and so
I I I would think that
maybe these chairs
in essence are
holding back some things
letting other things through maybe
maybe not even intentionally
how would you respond to that.
Mr chair
Senator Baca members of the
committee to clarify so I
I said that that was in the very
early days and I would
say in the first 90 days
that they were controlling information
or just helping feed it up to
me that really doesn't
exist anymore I am inconsistent
direct communication with my
direct reports on a regular
basis would you
say Mr chair that they all
have equal access to you
in or are treated equally
by you Mr chair
members of the committee just
thank you for that.
I wanted to ask you
to
about.
About this so
archaeological site
that has been talked
about here and the removal
out of items Mr chair
and secretary
he said it yeah I I thought
I heard you say that that was
alleviated
under your tenure that
there was an issue with that
prior to or maybe was testimony
from one of your supporters
can you go into that just a little bit
for me. Mr
chair Senator Baca members of the
committee yes that
with of those were comments and
testimony
so
nearly 20 years ago
when the department of
transportation
undertook the lightning
of 285
so north of Santa
Fe
under both state and federal
laws archeological clearances
are required.
The department of transportation
contracted with the office
of archaeological studies to
do the required
monitoring.
Not work was permitted
by the state
archaeologist which sits
in a separate division the historic
preservation
division.
Whatever entity is
responsible so there's a mix
of of tribal lands
set the federal and state
lands and private property
so just depending on which property
was being worked on a different permit
was issued by the state
archaeologist in conjunction
with whatever entity
it was in the case of
public property it's B.
I..
And not work is then
performed
by OS and
any contracting.
What it appears
happened is that
when
those.
Excavations and
monitoring or taking place
on public property.
Items were removed
that the Pueblo had
asked not to be
removed this
includes human
remains and canine
remains.
The they were removed and
taken to the office of archaeological
studies for
study.
This issue came to my
attention
basically a year ago
and I had to do a lot of work
to try to understand
what the situation was
and what was happening but
what is clear is the public
have provided clearance
permission to go on to
the property and
do that work they
had requested that certain
things not be
disturbed not be
studied and in instances
where they were removed and we're
going to be studied that the public
be a part of the research
it appears that that did
not happen.
At the same time given
the size and scope of
the project
report writing the
reports
that are required under the
permits was an
ongoing process
2025 years
later 3
of 2 of 3 volumes were
finished. The
issue with that
is that
the permit said that when
those reports were
complete any
items will go back to the
public. So
the that the status
of holding those reports are
keeping those reports and dressed out
us for so long was what
was the permitting
employment impediment to returning
those objects
so
working with the
state historian I'm sorry
the state archaeologist
B. I. A. and the
client and M. D. O.
T. as well as the Pueblo of
Pojoaque and
we agreed that
those
reports as
they were at that
time were complete
which under the permanent
triggered the return of
items to the
public who have not
done their cultural practice
to deal with that.
And that's
that's how
to keep
thank you Mr chair and and thank
you secretary so
these events are are these
infants in the
whole
related to the
termination of the individual
that has been mentioned several
times
here.
I'm
Mr chair Senators
members of the committee I'm actually looking at
my legal counsel to ask if
I can answer that question given the
pending litigation and I'm gonna
say now
okay thanks for
that answer I appreciate you
giving me that answer we talked
on the phone the other day in
the I
had some questions for you and I I
appreciate its time on the phone
and the answer much of them there are so
I will go through those
again I did disagree with you on
1.and that point
was that a
that these should not be discussed
in public I whole heartedly
believe they should be discussed in
public your
your position as a
secretary cultural
affairs certainly
warrants the public
knowing who
exactly is running that
department especially
with the authority it has
1 of 1 other thing that would concern
me during testimony mony
Mr chair and secretary
was of the mention
of the
Hispanic representation
within the board of
the natural history in
Albuquerque
can you can you comment further on
that what would it seems odd to
me in the state of 47 percent
Hispanic that we have a point
08 representation
slot
in in that particular
work.
Mr chair
Senator Baca members of the
committee those
are governor appointments and I really
cannot offer any
insights.
Did you have any influence are
you asked at any point Mr
chair and secretary about
what you think of these board members
and for input on
those
Mr chair Senator Baca
members of the committee yes I am
ask for input in the
case of the natural history board
the statute is very
specific about
the areas of representation
that need to be on that
board and so
I do think there are some challenges
there we did
put forward
a number of
of individuals.
From all forms of
diversity I
would I
would suggest that
and 2023 we are beyond
to try cultural
representation of the diversity
house many different
aspects to it and I
believe that the board
representative many of
those types of diversity
that we now honor
beyond
R. 3
cultures.
Structure I appreciate that
answers well I think that you
know in this state I think we're
we're moving
in a direction to me that
I I don't agree with and
in that where we are
excluding from certain
traditional groups within the
state whether it's
natives Hispanics on
what have you I'm gonna ask you
1 last question
on that I think is relevant
and I know it's not under your
control but I want your opinion on
it if you would
in the past recent
years
2020 to be exact
we seen
we sing the removal and
and even disruption illegally
sometimes of some of our
our most prized monuments
I would call in the state
things that reflect cultures
of of of different
heritages we saw
and I feel like it's
from outside influences
I think this state is very
cohesive
I know myself
in my family we
we enjoy
the company of
European whites and
native Americans
Mexicans a
native Hispanics
and and so I want
your opinion on the on the removal
of those those
monuments that were taken down
the obelisk in Santa Fe
soldiers monument
the monument would don the
able to block us and
1 day in the office
and and I want to know
your opinion as if those
should have been removed
or whether they should have been
left in
place.
Mr chair Senator
Baca members of the committee
I think you're you're asking
one of the fundamental questions
of our
time.
I think we're moving to a place
where we are understanding.
Increasingly the complexity
of history.
And that there is not
one view of
any given historical
events.
Everybody has a different
perspective and all of
those perspectives in my
opinion need to be
heard and understand
understood within the
larger context of
the community.
I think in an ideal
world.
The removal or the
changing of any
of those types of
items should be the
outcome
of what
may be a very
difficult
community dialogue
process.
I did engage in some of this
type of work when I was at the City of
Santa Fe not around
monuments but around other
things.
And the power of
having people
sit around a table and
talk about their shared values
talk about
their commonalities and hot
also talk about where they doubled
diverge is
a powerful thing
and I think in an ideal
world any change
or removal of those would have been
the outcome
of a public
process but of
course they were you know in in
2 instances
remote.
With you know outside of
anybody's authority or
control
but I do think dialogue and
discussion and respecting the
fact that we have different views of
history and neither of them hopped
in none of them have to be right or
wrong and that history
is an evolving thing
involving contacts thank
you thank you Mr chair I
appreciate your answer I know that was
a very pointed question
and completely put you
on the spot there
but again
here your position is important
enough to to be asked those
types of questions I
do appreciate everybody here
who testified today
that you took the time to come and
speak your mind whether in
opposition
or in
support of the
secretary it shows
that you're involved in the unit that you
care about the state
and I think that's what's lacking
Mr chair in a
lot of cases and so
thanks to you on thank you madam
secretary for for
your answers
today.
Senator
Lopez.
Thank you Mr chair Is working
Hey. I didn't
touch the thing
whatever.
Mr chair and
madam secretary
first of all thank you
for the work that you've done in the state of
New Mexico the last 4
years or 4.5
if we take.
I want to see also appreciate
those who are here today
in support and those
also who have
been in opposition
and I would say so much opposition
but I think also
adding to that and
saying pointing
out for us with our
challenges.
And up Mr
chair Senator of my issues
that I had written down as
I was looking through some of the
letters that were shared with us both in
favor and in opposition have been
asked so I'm not going to go back over
those.
But I
think.
Mr chair I wanted to make
a couple of statements
one
and and I think you may
remember I did speak with you
about the
mural that was
there also what
okay in Santa
Fe.
And how
the process may have been held it
may have been before you
arrived
as that new
museum of art has I think
a new opening just happened
recently.
But it was very saddening
I was very saddened because
of the work of the
artist who is
old who is older but
we're all getting
old.
And I think
you know for the community that
I heard from and I know that you
and I did speak briefly about
that but I'm saddened as to the
destruction of
what happened.
There a lot of pieces of art
in our state that
came back during what I call
the the rebuilding
of us of our you
know of
the state that I think we still
need to pay attention to and
preserve.
From that era
of
your during the
the late late thirties
and such of why that happened
some I will go forward to that but
I just wanted to say publicly and very
sad and what happened
there.
You're a couple of other areas
too I think of where
there needs to be some strengthening
with regards to the
arts.
Here we can see the organization
and I understand it's the purview
of every secretary that comes
in it's my understanding Mr
chair the department of health is going
through a re org so I mean
that happens and I've seen it during
my tenure for the
legislature it is
that's that's what
happens.
But I would hope
Mr chair that as
you look is
to.
Strengthening what you're trying
to do for communication with
the department that you don't have
peers supervising appears
because that is very
destructive.
It doesn't help especially
when you're looking for money to take
care of your little I damn your
little kingdom your little prize
that you have it says
everybody up very differently
and it's not good to have in
fighting I mean because it's it's
the nature of who we are as humans I
believe Mr
chair.
But Mister chair I think one
question that I wanted to ask
in invite if everything is
been stated
today.
I think there needs to be some healing
in your department.
And
I think the museum board of
directors.
If I could maybe just a point one step
back before I say one more
thing
of a statement I wanted to
make an ask you with
regards to the the museum board
of regents that are there I know
they come in front of our committee over
many years and such
I know they have a special
role in
oversight.
And I wanted to ask I
guess on this
point.
How was your communication
with the board of
regents.
Mr chair Senator
Lopez members of the
committee I think
as vice president Marianne
Cortese
stated
I think we have a very good line
of communication
between the museum of New
Mexico board of regents and
my office
one of the
functions I did create actually
was a specific
position that is
responsible for
being a liaison between the
line appointed boards and commissions
and the 7 foundations
and the numerous friends groups in
my office because
that communication with all of those
boards and commissions is so
critical on so I have
very good very Frank
very open communication
with the board of regents for the museum
of New Mexico.
And I appreciate that I appreciate
the vice chair sharing also
with us and in standing here
in support I
know Mr chair also that there
are you know concerns down
south
with with the museum
and we've all received letters read
that for miss Williams and
others she's very vocal in
the community down south and
others that we've
received.
Which leads me to the
question
there's one more area to the
national Hispanic cultural
center also has had some
serious issues an
ongoing.
And I know that the new
director I think is standing back
your someplace
but I know you
just because you're tall.
Used to like my sense I
picture him out right away
to but I'm hoping
that there's some attention is being
given
to the national Hispanic cultural
center also which
is a shining star not just for
our state but for this country
and I hope it actually gets to
realize
what its role is not only in New
Mexico but for the
nation so just
want to put that plug in.
So just what is Mr chair just
brings me to my question of
you with all that you
have heard here today if you
proceed after this committee with
a vote to move on to the full
Senate vote this
is not the end of the end of that
that the you know the
the walk you still have
to go in front of the full
Senate.
What. Will
you be doing to try and
heal.
The turmoil that has been shared
with us because I cannot
say that it doesn't exist
it's there you'll never have
100 percent none of us even
as elected officials have 100
percent in our communities we don't
it's just it is the nature of the
business.
This is my asking about
healing.
Mr chair Senator Lopez
members of the
committee.
I think you're asking the question
that really needs to be asked
and
what.
Then back up.
When people ask me why
I love this job what is
it about this job
because
as.
Pointed out it is a
world full of interesting
and awful problems
at any time.
I always say one thing.
It is the staff.
And the people with in and
around the department.
This turned out.
Opposition
support.
People are not involved
with this department
for a paycheck.
For 25 year P. E.
R. A..
This passion.
It is passion for what
ever it is it is
profoundly
personal. And
that's what I love about it I love
working for people that are just here for
paycheck.
Even if they're in an accounting
position.
I think here in the speakers
in opposition.
His involvement with the
department.
Predates me right
many many many years there are
not actively involved in the program
but they're still passionate
about it and the
concerned about what they
see.
I think if there's been an
error it has
perhaps been
not reaching out
to those people
those people who have been around
for 2830
years.
And understanding their
historic perspective.
I think that's where the
bridge needs to be
but.
Thank you Mr chair
madam secretary
with your statement I hope that you
will.
Make as much effort as
possible to
outreach to these persons
who we're here
today but there are others
at least and I know it's hard because
again in political life we have
those who are always and
the agree but
some of us do our best to try and
reach out and at least have a
conversation face to
face as to
what what and agree to disagree
sometimes that happens.
I appreciate you stating that and I
hope can
say they hold you to
it but I will say
ask that you
please do out some
outreach to try and
heal and listen to some of
those
who do have some prior
history that adds
value to the work that we
do and some of
us have been around for 20
splash years we've
seen plenty come
and go.
And.
Department of cultural affairs is
very central to
us in our state and
to the nation.
Recognizing and
valuing our
cultures that
we do have more New Mexico is
not a try cultural state anymore
never was but we need to
get off that mode and not
be disrespectful to
anybody but it we are
many.
That make up this beautiful
state thank you
Mr chair thank you
Senator
Ingle.
The. This
question what what.
What
Representative.
Senator
I
thought.
You are here this geographic
distribution on the various
boards and commissions that
are part of cultural
affairs.
The Mr chair Senator
Ingle members of the committee
yes as was
previously discussed the governor
appoints handles the
appointments we do have and
put and we have worked
very closely
with the governor's
office to make sure that we
have those that geographic
diversity right now
we are targeting a few
appointments that will reach portions
of the state where we don't have good
representation.
Well what
have some your staffs and meeting
aggressive approach on
the for side just curious
to well like to have
a sometimes we have
a concentration
of. Our
larger areas and we need to
have that too is just
the most population but we
also need to have a
scattering.
Throughout the state because I really
think it helps thank
you.
Thank you any further questions
thing that I have just a couple of
comments if you don't
mind.
20 years ago the the
lossless those historic
site was one that was
practically abandoned
and I think Eric Vazquez
as a native New Mexicans
some like myself can tell you that it
was a place where
teenagers went to
cause some sort of trouble
and to see I
have not made by the
way.
And to see that the area has
completely transformed
and is now being that economic
engine in my district
means a lot to me to
see that the history is now being
reserves the stories of my
ancestors are being
told and that the people
of today are benefiting from
that property means
a lot and as a former
county commissioner who served on the Rio
Grande that national heritage
area we work hard
to ensure that
we would preserve lost etcetera
so I'm thankful for your work
and the work of Eric I
guess than what's happening in
my district
I'm always excited to hear
from my constituents in
rural Rio Arriba County
and they were excited to know that
the museum could come to them
with displays that could come
to libraries to students wouldn't
have to load on a bus
and travel 3:00 hours
in one direction to
experience something that
your department can find
and so to hear from people
from Cambodia and
Savoy excited
that the rural library can now
be a place to
display for
students to experience is something
that means a lot to me as
a representative so many rural New
Mexicans and then the
last thing is if you do make it
past through the confirmation
I'd like to invite you to 2
things the Espanola
valley is building the
international lowrider
museum I would like for you to
come and see what we're doing
we have some pretty exciting stuff
happening we have a update
coming next week and
then with that I'd also
like to invite you if you make
it through to cruise
with
me.
Because our low rider
subculture is a
major sub culture of
New Mexico one that
carries so much pride
and when we think about low riding we
think about just nice cars
and people cruising
but north 10 years also realize
that stem education goes
into those cars that we build
the hydraulics the
amount of science that goes
into mixing the right amount of
paint I would love to
take you cruising at a
special.
So that you could experience
what we experience as
a sub culture and so
that you can that it better help
to help us to tell
our stories of north
tenuous how low
rider history came to us
and how we contribute to this
beautiful state of New Mexico
and with that committee
what is the will of this
committee.
