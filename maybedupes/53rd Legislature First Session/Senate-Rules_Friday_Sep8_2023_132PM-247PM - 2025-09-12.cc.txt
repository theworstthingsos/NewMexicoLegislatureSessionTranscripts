Good afternoon we're gonna go
ahead and.
Get started
again wrapping
up with
confirmations for
this 2 day meeting
and we're gonna
jump around a little bit on the
agenda we're going to start
with Margaret
branch.
And.
Thanks
yes.
Thank
you.
Madam chairman and and Mr
chairman
it's my honor to present to
you today a
nominee from the for
confirmation for the state
racing commission and
murder branches an attorney here
in Albuquerque well known
attorney we've
seen her on television
ads. And
in the news because she's
one major settlements
and many cases of
some of the more famous ones
including the national
tobacco litigation
case she's
been a practicing attorney for 40
years so she's had a lot of
opportunities to
do some
some to be involved in some
major issues
she also did a
settlement
of
well the tobacco settlement
involved at
1.$4000000000.
For the state of New Mexico
she she went on to represent
many clients in the northwest New
Mexico litigation
matter that resulted
in another favorable jury
verdict and settlement
for 100 families.
And she's the lead counsel in the
M. D. L. 926
breast implant
litigation which
reached a settlement of
1.2000000000.
With her husband Turner
branch
she met him at the downs of
Albuquerque in
1984 so you met
at the racetrack as
for and they
were frequent participants at the
downs of Albuquerque
the old Santa Fe
track the down
to Santa Fe and
really does so dense
she won a bet that the downs of
Albuquerque for 170
$5000 pay
out.
So not
that that's a
good this participation
sparked an immediate infants
on thoroughbred bread
and immediate intensity
of interest on her
part of the
thoroughbred racehorse
named forever
faithful.
The English translation for the
Latin phrase
semper fi
centerpieces
the marine corps
motto.
And Turner has served in the
marine corps.
So faithful
ran at
Belmont.
And Keeneland
in the 2012
racing season
and placed second in all 3
races at those so this is
a that was the the big
time thoroughbred
racing.
Markets love horses and
the sport of horse
racing.
Has continued and
she participates
even today in races throughout the
state of New Mexico
so letter state a few things
about her interest in being on the state
racing commission and why
she's particularly qualified
for
that.
Thank you very much is not
to be here I've certainly
raising commission now for about a
year
and and very
much enjoyed
my Representative my
participation in the racing
commission we have a lot of
issues and it racing is
not perfect of course
and we recognize that
but the
commission works hard
to see that
racing is the safest
possible for the
equity line industry and
for the horses themselves
and I love
racing and the person I'm
not I'm not an owner anymore
many horses
I'm on the commission there are
33
members that are
that that actually own horses
that are our owners
that makes it
very valuable
experience for us and
and their expertise is very important
to address the commission
but we're on the more the
public servant.
And that position that
any questions
are
I'd be happy to answer.
Thank you for that Mr printed for we do
that anyone in the audience here
in support of the country.
From the non
anyone in opposition
okay with that I'm gonna go with
questions of the commission Senator
Stefanics thank
you very much Mr chair
miss branch I had
and yes you have
the time that I was going to mention
this but could you
give us your opinion
or any faction might
know about the number
of forces that have died
down and the Rideau so
area.
Where where where where where the 7 horses
that died a few weeks ago
on when we can
and the governor of
course is
implementing making sure that
the commission elements drug
policies for
the horses put it drug
issue what
would look like it's primarily a
drug issue is a
drug out there the
as I understand it not being
an expert the drug out
there that the horses
are being administered
that make them run faster of
course and
the drug we don't know the
job we don't know what the drug
is and
we're trying to Canada for
a drug but we're doing everything
we can to make sure
that the horses are they given
any kind of drugs
that that they're tested for
them when we had DELLOSO
I'm one of the our
readers donate a
barn approach Martin
so all of the charity
potential security winners
are being put in that bar now
with security you cannot go
into the bar without
being cleared by
security and
low courses are there 2004
hours of course and
those.
Mr
Holley.
You might consider this
a little bit
off base to your
appointment but I think it's
related the governor
recently talked
about how guns
is a public health
emergency in our state.
From your background.
At the federal and the state level
one and all your volunteer
experiences.
Do you have any suggestions
of how our state
could address.
Some of the gun violence in
our
state.
I would
tend to kind of reserve and
not answer with an
opinion on
it I know
being appointed to the
public safety advisory commission
wouldn't be in that
realm.
So anything I could give this point
would probably be just based on my
opinion and
not.
Of true knowledge of
what is the point of what's
going on with with everything
in New Mexico right
now.
Well I could
see Mr
chair that your public
safety commission might be
us for some
recommendations
and.
Well I understand it's a very
early in the entire
process
I think that the state
is interested
in.
Prudent and
rational.
Recommendations
versus.
Our left wing
far right wing types
of notions
so you might
be just in the future but
thank you for your answer
yes Representative thank you Mr
chair from
any further
questions.
Senator Duhigg
and Mister chair I don't have a question I'll
just mention for anyone who
was wondering why

I I do appreciate it
it's a pleasure to be here
and an honor to be
considered for the tourism
commission I will tell
you that I truly
love this
state and all that
we have to offer
it is an incredible
place to live I
have.
Seen a lot of the country
growing up my my father
was a natural gas pipeline
construction and so I
lived in
28 states I've been
in 38 states
I think that's more than even a
military brat we could
break about
and I
once graduated from
high school said
leaving New Mexico and
never coming back.
So I left and came back
4 times.
And I am back for
good the last
time we came home
I will
never forget my wife
in the car ahead of me
calling me on the cell phone
saying in tears
saying I'm so
happy and I said why are you
crying she said I
just saw a mini van
with Haiti and goats and that
we're home and I
said yes we
are
this past weekend to follow
that up
I participated in a balloon rally
Colorado springs Colorado
the Labor Day liftoff
and had the pleasure of flying
there and but
on my way across the
border from New
Mexico into Colorado
we passed the pick up
truck and it
made me smile because
there were bags of hatch
green Chile being imported
into Colorado and
I said. That's
us so I
just love everything about our
state and
tourism and hospitality
means so much to our
economy here
in New Mexico and
to be
considered part of that
group that will help
shepherd and guide that I've
been a a New Mexico
true believer
from the get go we were an early
adopter in Gallup
of that brand
and I just
love all that
it brings and the opportunity
that tourism brings to our state
so I'm happy to be here
today thank you thank
you for that anybody in the audience
in support of the country.
With either one of you want to speak
on the company's behalf.
Make sure the state your first and
last name for the
record.
Mr chair members of the committee
thank you so much for having me come up
today my name is Jen Paul
Schrier I am the
former cabinet secretary
of tourism
and I am now currently
serving as the secretary
designate of the
aging and long term services
department and I'm looking
forward to coming forward
to all of you another
day.
Bill
Lee.
He's a dear friend so I'm
gonna tell you a little quick
story in the effort the
spirit of time because I know it's been a long 2
days for all of
you
but in 2011
this little California girl
phone my with the New Mexican
and as newly
weds he brought me back
here to New Mexico
and what happened
what started as a tragedy
with my my husband
being a victim of gun violence and
almost dying
I somehow ended up at the tourism
department because his
basketball coach from high
school was working there
and in the hospital he came and
visited my husband
and of course I was not
looking for a job in that
moment but he contacted
me later and said Hey you know you
might want to look at working
here at the tourism department.
And I ended up working
there. And
I surely Matt bill
Lee and
he was in the middle of
combining to
tourism agencies
like trade associations
the tourism association New
Mexico and the New
Mexico lodging Association
and he ended up recruiting me
to come in
and take over
this this association
that was going through this just
real huge change
of different stakeholders across
the state that wanted to come
together to really see tourism
grow and expand and become such
a real economic engine for the
state and
so he became a true mentor
of mine and really
educated me on New
Mexico green
Chile and all
over the state and I just absolutely
have so much gratitude
for bill and his leadership
and his willingness to mentor
me which really
led me into the role
of being secretary of
tourism.
He mentioned that he was
one of the first adopters in
New Mexico true he
was the first
and because of of
his belief in the
vision of this brand
which just seems like a logo to some
people but
there's people have tattoos
of New Mexico true on their
legs in their arms and
maybe there for it I don't know but
it's become something bigger
and better and something that
is a real
cry of a pride
for our state of that adventure
steeped in culture whether we're
celebrating the low riders
up in up in Espanola
or across the state for that matter
and bill has been a true
champion of the brand
of the department
and always willing
to support and bridge
when we need to collaborate
and do grassroots effort
efforts with
locals and I just really
appreciate you and I couldn't be
more honored to support him
today leaving
the department was very hard
because I am just in love with the
department but I know with the
leadership and the
guidance of
this lie in that we have here
next to me I
feel very confident in
him and the current
leadership up there so
thank you. Thank
you for your comments.
Come on up state your first and
last name for the
record.
Mr chairman members of the committee and
Lansing Adams the acting secretary
The New Mexico tourism department
I've known bill for over 10
years
as.
As Jen had mentioned.
When this was unproven
and this was untested
and this was just really driven
by aspirations
sound strategy
bill believed in that
and we could have done
this without folks like
Billy and now that we've
had the success of over 10
years of New Mexico
true it's an
honor for me after
bill had been so
supportive when it wasn't
easy for me to come
in and and and have the honor of
of supporting bill
so I would just
passionately urged
the the support of this this body
in in moving him
forward he's a
he's one of the good guys and I
I really appreciate it so
thank you. Thank
you for your
comments.
Without any questions of the committee
Senator Stefanics.
Thank you Mr chair
Mr Lee is
the main street program
in the department of tourism
or is that economic development
I believe that's an economic
development okay thank you
so well I'm sorry I
did not address the committee
my my
question Mr
chair and
Mr Lee
is.
How how does your
program.
How does the tourism department
interface with small
communities like
I know that many small
communities don't have
the finances
to buy into the New Mexico
true.
Advertising and marketing
scheme but
how do you interface with small
communities so I think that's
one of the beauties
of.
The department
and the dynamic
shift that we order take place
when New Mexico true came into
play.
The department is so
willing to partner with
communities realizing
that many small
rural areas in New Mexico
do not have
the funding
to significantly
create impact in the
marketing
area to
draw more people to that
and so I think when
you when you have the
opportunity is a small community
as we did in Gallup to
embrace that brand
and then utilize the
resources and the tools
that the department provide
you whether it's the co
op funding whether
it's now
the new events
marketing and and
promotion that they provide
those the
specialty
nuances of research
that are available to you
county by county
through the through the tourism department
all of those things I I think
begin to add up
in terms of
maybe not real dollars
to you but certainly
dollars that are spent
wisely to help
rural New Mexico and
then. By
partnering and utilizing
that New Mexico true
brand you're able
to make. Just a
small amount of money
go a lot further
by capitalizing on a brand
that is bigger than
your community so I
think I hope that answers
your question Senator
Stefanics thanks
Matt Mr chairman thank
you Mr thank you Mr
chair.
Thank you any further questions
Senator Ortiz Y. Pino
just one Mr chairman of
are you still on the racing commission
to no I mean the state for
going Senator
Mr chairman
no
I still have you
know when when I served on
the state fair commission
that was at a time when.
The things were
maybe a little bit rocky
but I I am
proud of the time that I did
serve in and enjoyed
it in fact I
sent Mr
morning a text
yesterday saying good
morning Mr positive have a
great state fair
and
and and
I still have an affinity for
that when I served on
the state for commission that was
my my
role in
terms of the commission was to
bring more of a tourism
aspect to it and get New
Mexico true more integrated
into the fair and so
that's why I was kind of
place there is because they do
fit nicely together yes
Sir they do thank you senator
thank you Mr
question Senator
Pirtle.
Thank you Mr chair
thank you senator you Mr
Lee good to see you back in
in a different
role
but I will say I think you you chose
wisely something
in
personable
yells.
I think so over the top
that's what's going to carry over the tight
today traded up
yeah.
I think a number
of that is to have the chair of the
committee to to present
you but I do
have a question just because in my
area we have the Mescalero
Apache tribe which is a huge
economic driver bringing in
people from
I think they're one of our largest markets
now is Mexico City
or show all the city or
out of Mexico
I was just curious what's the
relationship with the New
Mexico tourism department
and say some of our tribes and
pueblos and working
together because if
if we all work together
in reaching out
how is there any work
I know there's a lot
of
within other departments
of the As ons with the Indian
Affairs Department is there something
like that within
tourism
and then also just how are
we working with the tribes and
pueblos with regard to
tourism thank you Senator
pearl Mr chairman
members of the committee that's a great
question
you know at that
it kind of comes from my
area is well right
and northwest New
Mexico
I always say they have a surround
it and that's a wonderful thing
so we have the Zuni pueblo
to the south and then a great
Navajo Nation around just to
the north and to the
west we
certainly are also impacted by
Laguna at Aqaba
pueblos
and what we know
is that
we have to have great relations
with these folks because so
much of our
tourism and hospitality
industry
relies on being
able on folks being able to
come visit New Mexico
and then experience
all of that great culture
that they have
within those pueblos en route
and on those those
Navajo on the Navajo Nation
as well and so
we really embraced that
the tourism department does
have
incredible connections you
know
recently
the department was tasked with
putting on the inter tribal Indian
ceremonial this was the year before
last this year
that didn't have that
interaction was done
away within it became more.
Of a local event which I think
is the right thing to have
done but
during that time we had
an incredible
person leading the charge
through the department for
the one hundredth anniversary of
the intertribal Indian ceremonial
was very successful
even in a difficult time
with the pandemic and travel
being limited
incredible TV production
and television was done
that highlighted or native American
tribes and that
event in particular
and now that I understand that
that person who was running
that is now within the
department and is the
liaison to
tribes and pueblos
in in the
in the state so yes
it's critical that we have
those conversations and that we
include them and everything because
they are such an integral part
of what tourism and hospitality
is here but I
I also
will would be cautious
and saying
that while I love
the native American cultures that we
have. We have
sent so many diverse
cultures here I just love
that's and that's another selling
point of New Mexico right
we have.
Right Hispanic traditions
and native
American traditions and and
all of that comes together any
Gallup we have you know this
incredible.
Population of of
of of the Italian
descendants who came
there when it was a
railroad town in a coal
mining town in the
Croatians and
it's just this melting pot
of incredible dynamic
cultures that I think makes New
Mexico so special
thank you Senator Pirtle and
Mr Chairman thank you Mr
thank you for that answer yes I think it
is important you know
we we see a lot of business and Ross
like all of the Great Migration
on Fridays whenever all
those white license plates are
going through Russell headed to really
does so headed to the in
or wherever they're going
and linking county so I think it's
important especially
for just are counties to
work together as well
on the local level
and so is there some
support from
the state tourism
helping counties
work together to ensure
that that we're all
successful
do they work with county
commissions and local
to development
districts in
ensuring that we're all
successful
okay so you I would
point to work
that
we're doing right now
with McKinley County in the New Mexico
count in the
northwest Mexico council of
governments
and.
Lansing has been integral
in helping us set up some infrastructure
projects and those kinds of things so
yes Senator
Pirtle Mr chairman that
those those those
contacts and that
kind of work is going on
through the department of and
thank you Mr chair thank you members of the
committee for allowing me to
ask a few questions
I do have one more
I promise it'll be an easy
one is the is
the department doing us
a shift maybe to more interest
8 tourism
maybe focusing on on interstate
tourism let's say getting people
from Albuquerque to come visit the
caverns were getting
people from Carlsbad area
to go visit tent
rocks or things that beautiful
things that we have in the state because I
can tell you
37 years old
been born here my whole life
and I've watched
this over over and for the first time
you know and I I say
that these kind of little disappointment I
had a great time I'm not going to take
young children ever again I'm
just calling
but it's you know check the box right I
I did that and
and you know it's only
2.5 hours away
for me
is there are things that we can do
just advertise within
for people within the state
to to really enjoy everything
that it has because if
people within the state that
are New Mexicans
don't know about Carlsbad
caverns or hadn't been
to white sands or haven't been
to tent rocks or whatever and
then other people
meet them outside of New Mexico say
oh you're from New Mexico New Mexico
true you know one of
the law I
live in Albuquerque and I've never
been to you know
wherever is
there some way that we can
really focus on acts I think that's
one thing that's missing just speaking from
experience in ignorance on my
part not not
afraid to admit it is there
something that the tourism department doing
to to boost
tourism interest state as opposed
to just focusing interstate
Senator Pirtle Mr chairman
members of the committee I would
say yes very
much so
while I am also
very pleased that
the
the budget that the tourism
could Department.
Has continually seeing increased
over the past 10 years thanks to New
Mexico true and the
generosity of of our
legislature.
Well that some of that
goes to expand the marketing
efforts outside
of our state I am also
pleased to say that you know
a lot of the coop marketing which
I mentioned earlier I think
goes to drive in state
tourism to our smaller communities
and rural New Mexico
the new event
promotion that is being done
within the department I think also
drives
interstate visitation
to these places and
isn't it funny I
mean we always
seem to ignore our own
backyard right
and
I I know I understand
what you're saying and you
know there are so many
things that go
undiscovered by New
Mexicans in New
Mexico and
I I I appreciate the
question and I think I
think that we can do
bigger and better things there
but I think the department is striving
to see that that that
does happen so
that would be my answer Senator Pirtle
Mr Chairman committee members
thank you Mr chair thank you
Senator
Stewart.
Thank you Mr chairman so
there's so work for
what you're talking about
Senator Pirtle
I've seen it advertised
recently and it's called
staycation.
Staycation so
it's I'm I
think it must start
becoming from the tourism
department because I've gotten a
little email saying
staycation look in your
own backyard tent
rocks etcetera so
I couldn't agree with that more
but and and we probably could
use a little bit more that
to
but but my
Madam.
I have been
schooled
recently
in the error of
saying that we have a try
cultural state.
We have a multicultural
state no
my my district in
Albuquerque has the
international district
and.
23
different
languages
yes let me just
trying 8 this
other Asian
languages
Swahili
it's a huge refugee
population
at and they they speak
all kinds of
languages
so
but the biggest community
that feels left
out that
has been talking to me
is the black community.
Yes it's only 3 or
4 percent.
But they're organized
and they are ready to
be more part of
our overall
culture I have this
black leadership council
in my district
to is trying as
hard as they can to keep
kids in school
to provide things
for them to do after
school and for them
to have the ability to have
good solid
careers not
necessarily all go to
college but
use that trades
etcetera so so
I've I've had to redo
my
lingual.
Explanation of the
state it's not try
culture it's a multi culture
and we have so many
people here that add to
it so it's
just a comment I don't
know how you all are
thinking about it and
tourism department
but up but try try
culture does some sort of work
anymore I don't think
up so I just kind of a
COVID I don't know if you want to
comment on my
comment.
Senator Stewart Mr
chairman members of the committee
I can connect with you
more as I said you know in
my small town
in McKinley county
the the the number of
different cultures that are there
is always mind boggling
and and I keep I keep
trying to drive this
this chart
in this our in our in our
community that we should do a multi
cultural festival and
we we just haven't gotten
there yet
but one day we will
succeed in and get that that but
I agree with you that and that's what
makes New Mexico so special
is we we have all
of this and
we have so
many things that
are really untapped
potential when it comes to
tourism and and drawing
things and and I
I am just I
am. It
does my heart good to see the growth
that's taken place over the last 10
years with tourism in our in our
state because I
think we were for
many years consider the flyover
state you know and
I think that's
that that perception
is changing and
that's due in large part to the hard
work of the
department and that
the generosity of the legislature
that believed in tourism and what New
Mexico has to offer and
continues to support it
so thank you Mr
chairman Senator Stewart
