You see the the PRC is a the

sense and so I'd not sure they
I'm gonna have to vote against
it but I just wanted to voice my
concern thank you Mr president.
Further debate centers the
office.
I would yield Mister president.
Mr president what did the PRC it
said that the department of
transportation supported this
The Franklin Garcia those are
from Franken's from the
department transportation and
land of course is executive
director of the PRC and we can
Senator Sedillo Lopez while
they're making their way to the
chamber I'm gonna have you
restate the question for the as
once the once the expert
witnesses are receded so that
what does the PRC think about
this.
The commission themselves are
neutral Mr president there some
you for another question Senator
are you.
Thank you Mr president the FIR
says that there's no
appropriation either to the
requirement of transportation or
because if you if you look at
the bill on page of one fifty
seven all staff positions
function person appropriations
ambulance standards are
transferred to the department
the dollars everything transfers
in fact I talked to Mister
Probst before them we started
today they don't even have to
different different out of
Department.
Senator Sedillo Lopez thank you
Mr president so there are no
costs associated with the move
there's no cost is present.
because the PRC does have that
this experience and so the
department of transportation is
going to have to start from
scratch and figuring it out and
I'm worried that there may be
whatever the requirements are
it's just really important to
have stability and I'm worried
about this transfer a little bit
again I didn't hear it in the
solve here and then I look at
what are we doing to solve the
problem and with this bill I
guess I'm just not seeing the
problem that we're trying to
specifically a problem this has
to do with the constitutional
amendment and cleaning up the
final steps to make that
constitutional amendment come
not address this and so to me
this is again I get I have not
heard the debate and this is the
first I've heard about it but
again I'm I'm having trouble
understanding what the specific
office.
Thank you Mr president I rise
with some concerns about that
this build a big go back quite
some time the body probably
prevent geographic diversity
representation the PRC from
other parts of New Mexico
particularly those of us in the
south in rural New Mexico.
But I'll tell you that what the
lift and uber into New Mexico
you'll recall that and she was
having some difficulty with that
so I was asked to just carry
that bill and this was how we
Mexico and they're unable to get
it done very frankly they've
been trying for years and as a
result we were left we're not in
New Mexico.
And so we had to in this body
allow for licenses for limousine
companies for bands and
transportation services for
cabbies and for all other
transportation say the PRC
between lift and member opposed
by a cabbie Services.
So I want the body to be aware
that this is an important area
of the market place this
authority to regulate
this legislation it was that
response earlier question what's
the position of the PRC.
And the PRC's response well
we're neutral on this.
Kind of reminds me of when we
the time to us well we're
neutral on that too.
M. and managing the legislature
being asked to who well who do
we favor you guys no longer
being elected by the voters
we're gonna have you all
listen to more the debate but I
I would want to make clear that
we're transferring to
transportation in this bill from
the PRC something of great
authority and having a great
the voters and so I felt like
the voters would have some say
in the process that ship has
sailed the voters have decided
that the PRC will no longer be
subject to the will of the
voters but only to an
accountability to the voters
less sunshine we should be
concerned thank you Mr president
thank you Senator about this
Senator Gonzales.
objections centers may remove
the jackets and I'm gonna go to
Senate avail in response to
Senator about the Senate bill Mr
president like senator Wirth had
a comment or.
centers about Cervantes talked
about the uber lift needing a
legislature involved because the
PRC couldn't get it done nothing
would prevent the legislature
from getting involved it's a D.
neutrals because they've got
some commissioners support as
was stated some against but I
just like to share with you what
commissioner Fishman said
just wasn't working as well as
it should.
Likewise commissioner hall
jumped in here let me find
exactly what she said because I
the utility issues that are
important
me see if I can find
commissioner hall because she
has a good quote here to.
Again the voters did approve
this I know we had the debate on
the floor about whether they
should go to the voters in the
first place it's something that
I've worked on with former
utilities we're now bringing in
three commissioners that will
have a higher level of expertise
requirements to be there and I
just my response would be let's
uber and left we can bring it
right back here and have that
debate so that's why I've signed
on to this and it continued to
try and narrow the PRC and
we're just stripping down the
HSD anyone of no long term
strategy well I think the long
term strategy is that we want to
focus on utilities let's get
three expert commissioners in
Thank you senator Wirth Senator
Brandt.
The US president with the
sponsor yield Senator failed to
yield I would you.
just listen to what the Majority
Leader said.
And help remind me when we go
back to the constitutional
moment was or anything in the
amendment the said the PRC
Mr president Senator in effect
yes it says that the PRC will
regulate utilities and other
duties as assigned not that's
president what's clear in the
constitution is there is a
requirement that they regulate
utilities we can't come in here
and try and take the utility
structure they have these other
areas we're coming in to to
propose changing that law to
move this to Division away which
we can now do under the
constitution we could not do
constitutional amendment wings
we have to remove this and maybe
I just missed took away that was
stated in and I'm sure people
mistaken the way I've stated
things but
It's really up to us has chamber
I think the question becomes
who's better.
At regulating things like
is that now.
Transportation with would
regulate everything that comes
to rail and so you know that may
transfer of of
Bridge issues in our state right
now and I not sure I want the
former transportations loyalties
to be divided.
the resources to do so.
And the split their focus into
the US
It seems like this may be
something that we might want to
think about putting off for a
They come to us and say you know
this is a little bit too much to
handle we really want to focus
more on the utilities let's
wait.
or let's let's get rid of it now
I'm just not sure that right now
the department transportation
has.
The expertise to oversee this
although I know that the people
would be pretty much the same.
much an executive position part
of the executive branch and the
PRC is going to be appointed but
there are some guidelines in
there that doesn't make it just
fully under the governor's
or maybe there's a new kind of
company that wants to come in.
and
the the governor whoever it is
at that point to like them which
was one of the big issues that
state and that's just the facts
so it was so it concerns me I
think it's premature I would
Thank you Mr president not just
I was just checking with the
experts over here with regard to
when you talk about utilities
and
so who would have the final say
when you've got the PRC dealing
with utilities and then the D.
O. T. would need to be brought
these are all activities
regulating things like ambulance
services taxi cabs it was
pointed out to me by Mr Garcia
transliterating safety they're
already in the transportation
business this is just a division
that is a standalone Division
changing the administrative
Thank you Mr president I'm not
sure that that that gets to the
my question I just because I do
think that there will be some
overlap there maybe there
already is and
Thank you have any other
debaters for the first time.
Cenovus centers about this for a
second time Senator months.
Thank you Mr chairman president
various things but but I do know
that we've talked a lot about
what the voters approved in
approved and I think it's
important for us to at least
honestly acknowledge what the
what the ballot showed for this
percent voted yes because it
because if you listen to this
I'm just gonna read it to you
won't take long please just this
was with the voters under so
this debate says proposing to
amend the constitution to
provide the public regulation
We didn't put anywhere in the
ballot initiative that we were
going from five members to three
members and we didn't put anyone
about we were taking this away
from the voters who are locking
the doing that myself I can't
think of examples when I've done
it but but we should at least
acknowledge what we do out here.
The balance.
That the crew were asking the
and submitted to the governor by
nominating committee as provided
by law and the commission is
required to regulate public
utilities and may be required to
regulate other public service
District the PRC commissioner so
that those of us in southern New
Mexico were assured of a PRC
commissioner as were all other
parts of the state.
But I don't think that we can
generalization we say this is
what the voters voted for.
They voted for this because
there's just really nothing in
the ballot for the
I still think that there's a
place to have greater
transparency greater oversight
of something as important as
transportation and I'm given the
bring lift and over to New
Mexico.
It you and me both it took us a
lot of nights a lot of hours a
lot of acrimony a lot of
fighting and even here on the
wasn't so thank you Mr president
members for hearing me twice
thank you Senator about this we
do have Senator Lopez followed
by Senator with center city
office thank thank you Mr
You you very quickly talked
about the regulatory experience
that the department of
transportation has.
Could you elaborate on that what
kind of regulatory experience do
going to work Senator Mr
president Senator first off the
existing PRC functions included
in lane can help me here but
The road inspections.
That's the earlier of that is
that is the current PRC and
again this division is going to
remote out in the field and so
forth in addition of department
of transportation regulates
driver's education programs that
are locked programs point of
And I think that's the gist of
it Mister president senator.
Thank you Mr president I
focused on utilities but the the
accompanying issue of whether
the department of transportation
is ready to take all this on
sure about the analysis because
I am concerned about
inconsistencies between the two
divisions and so again I I still
come to us and tell us we really
want to focus on utilities only
or it may be that the governor
will say I can't find people who
want to regulate utilities and
commission and and stripping
it's it's responsibilities
prematurely it is a concern to
me so I I don't think I can
support this this bill thank you
deal.
Maybe I could bring this down to
something a little more home to
you.
In the fact that the the PRC
you have them area of the taken
serve.
And the reason for that they say

we actually discussed a little
bit can you help me with how
that would work with the
sovereignty issues of the

long going issue when we talk
about approaching some of the.

with the missing and murdered

there are no.
A lack of resources with the

it will be a first for the state

during the session the concern I
have

tribe's send the case to the
AG's office for the AG's office

what they work out of it will

going to be set up.
Mister president senator Matt
Brandt.
It is.
Not a streamlined process yet

when we talk about each tribal
entity because they have their
different resources and the way
Tackling itself this is a step
forward in progress.
But I'm finding out the absolute
I'm a little bit hesitant
because we don't have some
things spelled out and.

that also would allow some
flexibility as far as exactly

I.
So the so the.
In.
Senate judiciary is kind of
messed with some of my bills in
what those qualifications are
going to be what that person's
going to look like and how
that's going to be carried out.
And.
Thank you Mr president I'll I'll
take a look at that when I if
there's any continuing debate I
still have a lot of concerns I
do and how we can work better
with the tribes to make
some of this problem go away.
But it does it's going to take a
and but I in talking to present
as the other day I really think
that they're open to figuring
out what we can do they they see
how we address this issue we
have missing people all over our
state we're in the top ten in
the nation for people are
messing.
issues that are happening our

That they allow.
People to go in and investigate
they have that sovereignty and
I appreciate it and I'm honored

Mr president Senator Shendo it's
up to the tribe and the school
the purpose what programs they
want to implement the it's.
Leave and so doesn't impede on

respective of people from our
respective communities missing I
think we need to do everything
