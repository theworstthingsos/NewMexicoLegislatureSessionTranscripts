Whereas there are more than
fifty one thousand people in New

Pacific islanders and native
Hawaiians are among the fastest
growing and emerging communities

statistics about Asian Americans
Pacific islanders and native
Hawaiians in New Mexico the last
census counted over sixty
thousand members of this

and this community is one of the
fastest growing so the
population of Asian Americans in
New Mexico has grown by thirty
four point seven percent in the
last ten years and our
population of native Hawaiians
and Pacific islanders has grown
by seventy five percent.
And if you're curious where

Bernalillo Representative Roybal
Caballero thank you Mr speaker
with the gentle lady please
yield I yield to the lady from
Bernalillo thank you very much
thank you so much gentlelady for
introducing this very powerful
and important piece of
legislation it's a long time
coming it's been a long
struggle.
And I would venture to say that
gentle lady Mr speaker that that
census of twenty twenty sixty
thousand over sixty thousand is
probably a lot higher I think
there was a massive under count
on all of our populations but
particularly so in our Asian
communities and so I just wanted
to make that no because I think
it's important and Mr speaker
and gentle lady I stand on the
obviously and very strong
support of this legislation I'd
like to mention to the body that
the Asian American families in
Albuquerque is a thriving
Center.
It actually is the core of the
center of all education of all
organizing of all activities
they've been a strong voice in
ensuring that all the languages
are incorporated into health
systems like the University of
New Mexico health care system
they've been very strong
advocates and helped
pass the legislation to require
our departments increase their
language access so in the
language access bill that was
passable I I'm losing track of
years but I believe that was
passed in twenty twenty two so I
just stand in strong support and
on a final note I always stand
in strong support of this
legislation and these important
recognitions as a indigenous
native insured on a woman myself
and coming from these
populations and our
understanding our history that
at one time on this earth all of
us.
Came.
From the eastern.
Parts of our world.
And I think that's important to
understand and to recognize I
also stand in loving memory of
the founder of the Asian
American families.
And I know most of you will know
her name especially those from
Albuquerque Bernalillo county
daily outgoing data.
In your name Delhi outcome data.
I'll offer my strong support and
sponsorship.
And in your memory may this day
live on as an accomplishment.
Of what you took on and stood
for and fought for in your
community.
The present physically but I
know you were with us today.
So Mr speaker and gentle lady
thank you so very much thank you
and I urge to support and part
of the entire body thank you
there's further debate the
gentleman from Sandoval
Representative Martinez.
Mr speaker with the good lady my
friend from Santa Fe you.

gentleman from Santa.
Should only be I rise in support
of your memorial.
In the name of my stepdaughter
Sony who has brought so much joy
so much laughter to our family
and she came to us by way of
Mumbai India.
I have found.
A different perspective looking
at the world through her eyes
she is a survivor.
She is tall she might be little
but I wouldn't want to mess with
her so in honor of my
stepdaughter Sony I rise in
support of your memorial.

San Juan Representative thank
you Mr speaker Mr speaker I
would like to introduce some
very special guests money there
in the rostrum today Mr speaker
with us is my former coach and
his lovely wife Christensen and
Terry Stinson and they're part
of our celebration this morning
of Asian American Pacific
Islander and and native Hawaiian
day and for those that don't
know coach Stinson let me let me
brag on him a little bit he's
well renowned throughout much of
the southwest in the country so
coach Stinson was raise an asset
graduated in nineteen seventy.
And he was a two time state
place winner in wrestling.
he went on to wrestle at
southern Utah university and
then this is where his career
becomes very meaningful and
impactful for all of New Mexico
he started coaching at Aztec
high school back in nineteen
seventy six during that time
he's led his team to seventeen
team state championships
including a time period of
eleven in row eleven in a row
and I was part of that nineteen
ninety nine and two thousand
team state championships during
that streak he's coached nine
teams admin ranks nationally in
the top twenty five top high
school wrestling teams in the
country he's coached eighty
three individual state champions
his current record is five
hundred fifty ninety seven and I
he's seven times been The New
Mexico wrestling coach of the
year.
He is in the New Mexico coaches
hall of fame our hall of fame
all of honor excuse me he's in
the New Mexico wrestling hall of
fame he's been the national
coach of the year three times in
two thousand sixteen he was
inducted into the national high
school athletic coaches hall of
fame.
In two thousand twenty one he
was named by New Mexico
wrestling the all time best New
Mexico coach and just this fall
Mr speaker of coach Stinson one
of only two wrestling coaches to
ever be inducted coach Stinson
was inducted into the
prestigious New Mexico sports
hall of fame Mr speaker I want
to read a paragraph.
That coach Stinson read during
that induction speech I think it
is really telling of coach since
is background really what we're
trying to celebrate the here
this morning with regard to
are Asian American Pacific
Islander and native Hawaiian
days so because since a row mom
and dad played a heavy part in
my direction with their attitude
of no fear approach to try
something new or different
because the worst thing that can
happen is failure and failures
the mothers of success my dad
Howard since and dropped out of
Aztec high school his ninth
grade year and went into the
military dad was on the newly
commissioned USS Valley Forge
the last of the wooden top
carriers although he was
primarily involved in the mop up
time period it was his being
stationed in Japan during the
occupation time for that that he
met my mother such echo a young
lady of samurai descent who had
survived the bomb living sixty
miles away from the first bomb
and a hundred twelve miles away
from the second bomb mom was
spoiled and she grew up with
wealth and influence is a pan a
far cry from a farmer's family
in little that stick New Mexico
for dad had for bit her from
seeing a GI but love prevailed
and they married in Japan in
nineteen fifty one he was
conceived because since was
conceived in Japan and then
later born in Farmington.
Their strength is my calling
card later in life after living
in Maryland while dad was
getting out of the navy mom who
was a hundred pounds five foot
tall Japanese girl had to drive
from there to all the way to
asked to Cologne with the two
rolled into once again as an as
the navy would not allow him to
transport his family after two
years of working in an as dad
said starving we went back into
the military this time the army.
And this time the army went to
create a station average panel
relive for over here upon
returning to asked tech mom
would not let any of us talk in
Japanese as we all know the
Japanese were not well received
at this time but chin up and
fast forward my sophomore year
at Aztec high school and after
deciding because of a great man
named coach Jerry Parker I went
out for wrestling.
That season I made the
commitment to become a teacher
and coach in nineteen sixty
seven and that would and that
would with the no for added to
dictate my life to the state Mr
speaker I I know that there's a
handful of people and everyone's
life that make a tremendous
impact in who they become active
tell you that Christensen is on
that very very short list for me
I I I love the man and
appreciate everything he's done
for my community the sport of
wrestling is tremendous and he's
been influential in my life and
and many others so just one
hundred percent since morning
thank you Mr speaker coach
stance and thank you for your
service and welcome to the state
house.
We're announcements the gentle
lady from Dona Ana the legal and
whenever Senator Jones.
Mr speaker I stand for point of
personal privilege state your
point.
I'd like to share some health
care statistics and concerns.
In twenty seventeen from twenty
seventeen to twenty twenty one.
Over four year period that for
years he period seven hundred of
our primary care physicians left
New Mexico.
That was almost a third of the
primary care physicians that we
had here in New Mexico.
With which left a shortage in
almost every county of primary
care.
And that the I don't have the
numbers but I know we have a
shortage across the board of
physicians specialties not only
the primary care.
Another thing the majority of
our physicians that are
practicing for over fifty years
old and they're looking at
retirement.
Another stat medical students
who receive an excellent
education at UNM and fall in
love with the New Mexico when
they finish they leave our state
because this is not a friendly
place to practice we have a
health care crisis.
And it's a crisis of our own
making.
For far too long we fail to
increase Medicaid reimbursements
we have failed to remove taxes
the G. R. T. taxes on medical
services I believe are one of
only two states that actually
tax medical services and if all
of that wasn't enough in twenty
twenty one this legislative body
and our executive.
Past HB seventy five which
skyrocketed the medical
malpractice insurance
requirements of to to for
medical malpractice act up to
four million dollars which.
A makes it almost impossible for
physicians to get malpractice
insurance.
So we created the crisis.
And who suffers the people of
New Mexico the people of New
Mexico sadly.
I'm not getting the health care
they deserve.
We created it by the laws that
we made and the laws that we
fail to make.
But the good news is we can fix
it.
So there's no time to lose
fellow members
we need to make this a positive
place for physicians to practice
and care for the people that we
serve.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
John lady we do have some guests
in the gallery from the town of
