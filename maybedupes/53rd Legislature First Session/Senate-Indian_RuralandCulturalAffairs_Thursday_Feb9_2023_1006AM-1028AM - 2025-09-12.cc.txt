right and so anyways at
madam chair and etcetera
etcetera I see you deep in
thought of the moment I don't.
I don't know that this is
particularly anything at the
moment get or not but.
Of Representative madam chair I
don't know what use when you use
your scenario your hypothetical.
It is if the if the project is.
A ten million dollar project.
It's a twenty percent match.
The fed provided eighty percent.
Eight million in the state.
Provides two million under your
scenario.
How you thinking that the
tribe's going to get more money
to pay back the loan.
Because of the full amount is
ten million so the first so if
there's a match requirement and
the proposal will go ahead and
requesting the Feds for the
eight and then the match will
come from the state to.
Another tribe's prepaid that
that two million once you get
the grant this makes sense
because that two million still
need to make before ten million.
For the project works try to
it's only six million dollars
at.
What that does to the six
million dollars at the end of
Madam.
I don't think that was the
intent of the Senator.
Senator.
You can just listen to me so.
Of.
Madam chair of the list Senator
right or wrong but the maybe he
could use it others to come up
with another hypothetical
example that may make more sense
to me yes madam chair I think I
think he is hearing me right and
I think he is listen.
He's judging it wrong.
Both right and wrong.
In the you know and that's what
I've been and that's a that's
press board with a conversation
that they need to happen in
terms of structure these right
in the right madam madam chair
it's committee madam chair I
think the difference between.
This process and the bill that
we voted on is that.
The families or the individuals
madam chair and that are
expecting you know of federal
funding but it's not coming soon
enough so what we're doing as a
state is creating that fund to
help them so when they get their
state money or federal money
then they will reimburse us we
keeps everybody.
Extend whole makes us whole but
in this instance there is no
promise of federal funding you
have to apply to get elected for
your project let that only then
will the feds find the money and
the matching will happen so it's
not a guarantee in the other
instance in your example with
the bill we passed last year
that's a guarantee funding
that's coming from FEMA to help
those families so what we're
doing this from the that money.
Madam chair it is that much that
I think that's what I voted for
Madam session of that.
That is a believer for incorrect
and and and and and and you have
the right to understand the new
voter I'm just saying that I'm
just recognizing that not just
with regard to tribes are local
governments throughout the state
right and that there is that
there is Madam federal funding
out there that can only be
accessed.
If there's seed capital that a
lot of these local governments
and a lot of the nations tribes
opposed don't have the State
Capitol.
Yes thank you madam chair I
think I understand that but to
make it make them pay back as a
loan.
For the small municipalities I
don't think that makes sense
because why would it be asking
for matching to begin with so
that they have to pay that get
out of here and madam chair
etcetera etcetera because they
wouldn't get the they would be
able to keep the six million
dollars of they didn't have the
two million dollars.
For the tell match.
So that's what this Madam that
would they're still
significantly a hat on the in
terms of federal dollars come in
the state another west manager
right now the I would like to
make a motion on page three
slide sixteen sixteen three team
to strike.
Of the total amount that may be
expended from the fund each year
is ten million dollars.
So as a motion to get the.
Session on the.
After listening to remove the
cap might sort.
Second by second any further
discussion on the motion six.
Made by Senator seconded by
consensus.
When we.
A lot of this spending and we
know this from the past is say
okay this is the amount of money
we're gonna put here within a
remove the cap but we don't tie
it to in the index or any kind
of
so that there's no gap.
So we know right now with this
bill we know that this amount of
money.
Is kind of hypothetical to
because we don't know if it's
under funded are over funded so
we take out the cap without
putting some kind of mechanism
in that I feel like we're just
still not really fully
Coming up with a solution.
Not sure at all.
Well I'm sure it's still hold on
yes.
Internet issues.
yes that that Dadi was going out
the videos opting out okay yeah
we're offline right now so we
have to state that set in place
until it's back on but people
can't hear me the.
It.
They wanted to hear you
overloaded this.
So we're on right now until.
Until further notice.
