every public you look at the
distribution of who is a task
force member
will take concern groups in
abortation.
Horse and then historically
we've always put his remiss
glare because there physically a
part but with the public even
though there's nineteen of them
we always done you know either
three southern or northern so
just because they're excluded
from here does that mean that
the they don't have I mean if we
need it to we should have list
every tribe but I think at this
point I will be opposed to
changing the composition of.
It's not inclusive of every
tribe it's a portion I know that
they have relatives in this
glorial government for college

speak on behalf of.
