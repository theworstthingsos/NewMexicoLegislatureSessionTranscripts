Because we are mandating that
the insurance companies all
insurance companies they can no
longer charge for the copay and
those insurance plans regulated
through the demand New Mexico
department of insurance.
Okay so Mister speaker dealing
so those regulated through the
department of insurance so now
that they're going to be

this.
Wait a minute Mr speaker gentle
going to physically pay it or
they're going to waive it Mr
speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker gentle lady they will
waive those costs.
Mr speaker gently decided
meaning you can't say one person
pays a co pay and the other
person so can you just tell me
where in the insurance code that
this would be applicable Mr
speaker gentle lady.
part of this discussion on this
bill they are neutral we have
had lots of conversations about
that and they are.
They are good the bill did
change on the Senate side before
those plans are are eligible
after they paid their deductible
right those are the things is
going to bring up Mr speaker
dealing I don't have the updated
version with the Senate changes
The insurance company says we're
going to pay.
But I know a little bit about
how businesses run and in the
real world when we have a
Mr speaker and only the the
biggest problem I have with
this.
Is and I brought this up before
which was interesting is I'm
Are some was talking to her I
don't know if I could go home to
my constituents and say yes
while I go voted for this bill
this is somebody who and I'm not
bashing the because you know
everybody does procreate and
sometimes things happen and that
I totally agree with.
The problem that I have is some
to my constituents and say that
I supported this and look at
people who have other disorders
MS Alzheimer's anything else and
talking every shot up this is
figure delivery
I can't go back and say I picked
one over another I would feel
horrible about that and I also
that at least insurance code in
other states that I'm going to
be can't do that and say we're
going to pick one over another
because now that's you're
discriminated against one
wakes up one day with any type
just pick any kind of disease
and they're eliminated from this
and I absolutely don't think
that that's fair on a
humanitarian level Mr speaker No
late and that's all the
yield to my friend from Ontario

gentle lady so just a few
questions here I want to be on

question was regarding it I
think the representative from
Torrance and Bernalillo touch on
eating the cost of the lack of
paying as the individual with
the copay Mr speaker Mr speaker
gentleman those costs are
absorbed by the insurance
company and I will adhere that
less expensive than treating an

going to be able to get that for

after year Mr speaker and gentle

for myself it it's it seems to

we're doing is we're paying for

that I see that that seems all
that fair

during debate and then I forgot
again Mr speaker and body the my
expert witness today is public

once again the numbers that you
brought up for exactly the same
numbers that I'm working from
My my concern is if we have of

That with a future disaster
especially if the federal
government is going to pay

Which is that these funds could
be used for this purpose.
But.
Whichever Seki as would be
applying for these funds to be
used for this purpose would also
the dollars coming out of the
acequia Fund would have to be
replenished as if it were alone
very similar speaker and gentle
lady to what was in Senate bill

this to make sure that the fund
doesn't get depleted.
And that that it would be back
filled with federal funds of
those federal funds were

Thank you Mr speaker once again
the representative from the San

the word of folks on this one
but the speaker generally we
there's seven R. three seconds

we want to make sure that they

Thank you gentle lady hi rise

lady Mr speaker and gentle lady.
that but with this fund.
Heard the capital outlay monies
that are being donated to the
a second us it's a in any manner
can tell you
these funds combined with
capital outlay funds we can't
even cover the needs so I I
think they'll work side by side
as best they can
do the design for what's needed
on their respective they know
with the best people are to come
in and and do the engineering
studies so they give them the
that goes out and does these
preliminary bids to so the this
is what will work so we can get
the best price and then we take
that list from them and then we
with all capital outlay funds
won't even touch the need I can
tell you that.
And madam chair Mister speaker
and and that goes to my second
So I look forward Mr speaker and
and.
And the gentle lady to see how
it does work in the future and
in the division leader close.
Mr speaker I move that Senate
bills one seventy eight one
Well to close.
What is level of six for the
from entering the negative
Senate bill one seventy six as
amended has duly passed this
house deleted from Bernalillo
seven as amended on final
passage as we taking it is now
subject to debate amendment or
substation the gentlelady to
explain the bill yes Mr speaker
this bill simply codifies
gentle lady from Santa Fe
representatives to Penske.
Thank you Mr speaker with that
kind gentle lady yield.
Received some.
Emails regarding this bill so I
did.
Quite a bit of.
so I.
Upon reading the bill it seems
to me that a major purpose of
this legislation is to establish
Mr speaker lady from Bernalillo
these school based health
centers have been in operation
in our state for twenty five
With this bill would anything
about.
Putting these school based
health centers into law require
absolutely not and just for your
knowledge there already
Seventy nine of school based
health centers that have existed
the bill on page two that at the
establishment of school based
health centers depends on
support from local educational
authorities is that correct
and in their particular school
district needed to find a school
based health center there's
nothing in this legislation that
would require them to establish
that are even consider that is
anything in this bill that
changes the way that the
providers ask those seventy nine
existing school based health
centers treat
follow existing law.
And so gentle lady Mr speaker
and gentle lady for consent for
those services.
a student yes Mr speaker and
gentle lady absolutely.
Thank you for that Mr speaker
and gentle lady I I I might my
up his arm it was it looked I
think a lot worse than it may it
might have felt
I was concerned he came home
that they would address is yes
Mr speaker they would.
Mr speaker gentle lady if I
child was having a difficult
counseling those kinds of
services is would this be a
place that those students could
access that kind of support also
Mr speaker yes.
centers maybe about probably
twenty years ago when I first
started working at the
department of health and the
people who worked on school
based health centers it was a
as possible to those children
going in and out of that school
every day and Mr speaker gentle
lady it made a lot of sense to
me because there are a lot of
things we have to look out for
scrapes get taken care of we
have to make sure that someone's
watching out for kids when
they're struggling with those
those hard days or perhaps they
have questions or maybe they
years and we're just finally
getting around to putting them
into law and so generally I want
to thank you for that
and I think one one of the
department to establish rules
and procedures for the school
based health centers so that we
can make sure that those are
being implemented across the
the same care and the same types
of basic services which include
urgent care
for those.
and gentle lady and Mr speaker
and gentle lady some of these
clips how school based health
centers also provide dental care
difficult to access in our state
for children at times and so
having that dental care on site
with it with the appropriate
gentlelady because I think it
keeps control of the school
based health centers with the
school boards it keeps it with
in the control of those
a licensed health care providers
that are local providers so
we're not asking schools to all
of a sudden hire their own staff
for asking them to partner with
local agencies is that correct
Mr speaker gentle lady I I I I
won't go on too long but I just
wanted to commend you and
highlight some of the key points
In our state that has existed
for twenty five years but now
bringing it into a regulatory
process where there will be a
lot of opportunities for public
Thank you Mr speaker the kind
gentle lady from Bernalillo
please you yes Mr speaker I
yield thank you Mr speaker and
gentle lady so you know I've
school based health clinics Mr
speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker and gentleman there
any say whatsoever and how these
are run further the guidelines
and promulgated rules Mr speaker
gentle lady.
Actually of follow of a national
medical model and they subsidize
some of those programs.
Okay thank you Mr speaker gentle
this coming from Mr speaker
gentle lady.
Mr speaker and gentleman it's
the national model for.
your first page of the bill just
start there on page nineteen
this is the department shall
provide funding.
So Mister speaker gentle lady
Mr speaker and gentleman.
Depending on how much money the
the department has they
subsidize about thirty to forty
percent of those health clinics.
Okay thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady so then what would the
portion of the of the state than
for these clinics because Mr
speaker gentle lady I'm just
looking at your FIR I see that
Mr speaker it also depends the
funding will depend on how many
are requested by the schools
health clinics how many do we
currently have in the state of
New Mexico.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
Okay thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady subduing on the process
could be approximate cost of how
much each clinic may cost or
Mr speaker and gentleman
The total average reported costs
average reported cost to operate
a health clinic for schools with
two hundred and one to nine
hundred ninety nine students is
about a hundred and twenty two
thousand five hundred and the
students is about three hundred
thirty four thousand nine
hundred to about two hundred and
thirty five thousand.
Okay thank you Mr speaker and
gentle lady I appreciate those
department so provide technical
assistance Mr speaker gentle
lady what's the technical
assistance that is reference
here on the line nineteen and
twenty Mr speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker and gentleman the D.
O. H..
making sure that those clinics
are following the letter of the
law that is provided by D. O. H.
and they're making sure that
to help find someone who could
provide those services excuse
me.
would be the oversight and the
the technical assistance portion
of that and with that include
anything to do with the
local school boards to make sure
that they have of the oversight
that's needed to provide the the
budgets for the PED and the
department of health to do have
sufficient funds so that they
can have that collaborative role
to ensure that they have that
kind of technical assistance so
Mister speaker generally I'll
shells you know the schoolbased
health centers shall work in
cooperation with schools and
school districts they shall
provide services through
licensed providers they shall
adopted promulgate rules the
rules that have been promulgated
by the state Mr speaker gentle
lady to care and gentleman this
is existing law all this is
doing is codifying those those
that they are positive models in
those communities.
Okay thank you Mr speaker and
gentle lady so then.
the schools and which ones would
be now eligible under the new
statute that we would be
creating to be able to provide
this Mr speaker gentle lady.
which include the local
hospitals federally qualified
health centers the department's
public health nurses and other
qualified health the providers
but the goal is to keep those
a preference to a locally based
clinic hospital rather than a
national group that may have
chains around the country Mr
ensuring that their run
properly.
Okay thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady but this would not preclude
them from.
Putting for the let's just in
our of P. or something to get a
It it probably would preclude
them based on the funding that
needed to to do the work.
school boards of chooses is that
correct Mr speaker gentle lady.
and that mental health care
process.
Okay thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady then I'm gonna just
continue on the bill I'm on page
two now and I'm looking at
care provider to be able to
diagnose and then to treat these
medical.
These.
Okay thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady but they would need to be
licensed in mental health care
is there a specific a license
that needs to be obtained
all this kind of expertise and
certifications from the process
Mr speaker gentle lady could
this be theoretically like a
It doesn't necessarily have to
be a physician they have to be
licensed and they have to follow
all the state protocols to make
sure that they get those
licenses.
crisis intervention entails Mr
speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker and gentleman
documentales school shootings
Okay thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady so it is it seems crisis
interventions as any kind of
crisis that may happen like
let's just say something
lady and then I see on the
bottom of page two S. as
referrals as necessary for
additional treatment including
inpatient care etcetera so
Mister speaker gentle lady with
Mr speaker and gentleman all the
guess if if a student comes to
the clinic for this wholesaler
Mr speaker gentle lady and there
there's something that they need
help with Mr speaker gentle lady
the the parent has if the school
district has gotten involved
with the school board has gotten
involved and they've signed that
parental important yes.
they not need to consent to than
Mr speaker gentle lady.
Okay so thank you Mr speaker
thank you generally do so over
the age of fourteen if a minor
wanted to access for the
reproductive health care and
Okay thank you Mr speaker thank
you generally and then can you
define for me what reproductive
health care is because I don't
see it in the bill The than Mr
speaker gentle lady.
What kind regarding we certainly
I STI health education or
whatever the child is looking
for to make sure that they are.
Mr speaker and gentleman
absolutely not because they are
Any kind of contraception needs
like that Mr speaker gentle lady
or would that be prohibited
federally as well.
Mr speaker.
and the if reproductive health
care is preventive yes.
Okay thank you Mr speaker thank
you generally so I just wanna be
health clinics whatsoever Mr
speaker gentle lady is that
correct.
Mr speaker No because its
specialty care.
Okay thank you Mr speaker thank
you gentle lady we talked about
these people needing to be
specialized with all these
gentleman remember that the
final say so comes from the
school board.
And there's.
Okay thank you Mr speaker thank
you gentle lady so.
I know that they're the key but
also Mr speaker gentle lady
we're putting forward mandates
That we're not.
Keeping individuals from being
able to provide certain services
or if we are what those services
about reproductive health care
Mr speaker gentle lady so since
that's not in the statute what
that does not be allowed other
than simple preventative care as
stipulated in the bill Mr
centers shall provide services
to licensed providers and then
it gives you a list but that may
not that may also mean that the
health if you do see what I mean
the choices with the school
board and that's why there is an
for at the end of the number
six.
The goal is that they don't have
to do all of those things.
Okay thank you Mr speaker thank
you gentle lady when looking on
that as as.
I don't see that on here because
Mr speaker gentle lady it
includes primary care preventive
health care treatment of a minor
acute or chronic conditions
mental health care substance use
so yes at the end of the six
point twenty four okay Mister
speaker generated seven the top
ones three through six are
Mr speaker they are deferential
to the local provider and the
local school district to provide
any of those resources they are
not mandatory.
orange so afterward Mr speaker
gentle lady that leads me to
believe that they must require
these if they were to set up a
health clinic because Mr speaker
Okay thank you Mr speaker thank
you gentle lady so I'm guessing
so this these individuals could
just pick and choose what they
want to offer than Mr speaker
gentle lady they could just pick
it's a local created models so
they pick and choose what they
want Mr speaker and gentleman.
Okay thank you Mr speaker thank
you gentle lady and then my
of the the school and Mr speaker
gentle lady my question is what
if his child was not.
They didn't have health care
insurance for instance Mr
speaker gentle lady how would
that be dealt with regarding
referrals.
Okay Mister speaker and
gentle lady so if these
referrals did happen and this
individual as to say they got
dental health care that dental
health care would not be.
Mr speaker and gentleman
rephrase the question for me
please Sir thank you Mr speaker
and gentle lady so if we give a
referral from the school based
health clinic.
speaker gentle lady the child or
the parent would not have to pay
the cost of that referral Mr
speaker gentle lady is that
correct.
Mr speaker that's not correct.
are the children who have
visited these
These are school based health
centers are usually kids that
can't afford.
Then if and if they have
insurance and they can move
forward otherwise maybe Medicaid
or Medicare helps.
and their parents have not what
the school has contracted out Mr
speaker generally Esther speaker
he's you're correct okay thank
you Mr speaker thank you
generally I appreciate all the
answers thanks so much thank you
more of the move touched on this
Mister speaker and I may have
missed it so.
A. and section F. talks about
promulgating rules but you
stated that these rules are
health clinics the rules have
already been promulgated.
Thank you Mr speaker No lady
then why do we need to codified
if they're already in place
they've been working for twenty
or anyone else that chooses to
fund that we're not.
Thank you Mr speaker the lady
but if a school district have
representative Duncan the issue
is that getting these
school based health centers
codified provides access to many
The lady so did you just say
that and let's this bill goes
into place that we're not going
to be able to treat some of
those kids and they haven't been
treated in the past.
mind if I said that kind of have
a little gentility that is
absolutely fine.
Thank you.
these kids for twenty five years
and now we may not be able to do
that I I don't I guess I just
don't understand that
The mask you one last question
Mr speaker and gentleman they
can choose which services that
one offers.
Mr speaker gentle lady so does
they wanted to to give.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes the
school board at the school
but I I don't see school board
and in this bill at all I see
the O. H. in it but I don't see
school board and and that's what
I'm concerned about is taking
away the local folks.
shall work in cooperation with
schools and school districts and
be operated by the license
health care providers it's set
to.
please yield yes Mr speaker I
yield to the gentle lady from
Bernalillo and helped and the
side of the mountain.
The county towards thank you Mrs
Since then section is public
health act to create our bring
the school based health centers
which we already have.
What we want Mr chairman and
gentle lady is a commitment to
this to achieve the spirit of
the act which is the part of the
Okay Mister speaker and gentle
lady so we're going to pass this
for something were to happen
just answers internet stand.
It doesn't say where permanent
permanent funny but you said
Mr speaker and gentleman
currently an executive.
Gentlelady when it can it can do
away with these if they wanted.
new material on seventeen we
talk about school based health
care centers creation operation.
Okay so we're making a.
speaker delayed the department
what department are we talking
about Mr speaker and gentle lady
the department of health okay
there we go so the department of
health.
Okay so I guess what you're
trying to say years they're
going to do the clinical
oversight.
Of the whole entire program.
But we have the word shall.
And then we go on to state
licensed providers and all these
different types and I think a
doesn't say you know like in the
next line and the school board.
May pick and choose from these
Department of Health.
choose Mr speaker gentle lady Mr
speaker and gentle lady it
doesn't have to say that this
what is that years dating
because it says on page two
those are those are options for
the school and online six at the
very bottom the letter the word
or.
because the shell portion so
we're saying shall have these
have that have number three have
number four number five and
So Mr speaker and what last
question on the bill Mr speaker
jealous of department of health
to census all of the school has
a choice and that's where we
it's kind of a.
It says within the boundaries of
the school campus or within a
safe walking distance of the
school so how far away is a safe
walking distance and are they
Okay so you're saying that the
school Mr speaker Delhi would
decide.
How far away that is and could
that include Planned Parenthood
Mr speaker W. so.
So when I'm trying to just make
that Planned Parenthood could be
the possible location where
these children are walking to to
get care Mr speaker John.
Mr speaker.
Gentlelady they do preventive
health care that's a planned
parenthood's big messaging is is
that there the evolution is
health care and they do
gentle lady it does not.
I don't know Mr speaker dealing
I think I could argue that all
day long because they talk a lot
about abortion is health care
and they talk a lot about that
it is preventative health care.
state
then on one of the ones is
mental health care.
Would the parents be told this
would be no Mr speaker gentle
lady.
Fourteen and over they don't
need to the the parent but you
know obviously we all want them
to include them but that doesn't
mean they have to.
So Mister speaker and gentle
lady.
I see the pros and cons of that
of a child and discusses some
there was created personal but
at the same time I would be
horrified if I had a fourteen
fifty on child that was talking
they're not may not be into
something that the child is
trying to deal with but at the
same time that's such a huge
issue but that that is I do that
because that of the law that's
In psychology there's a ton of
different types of care with
different types of focus.
So would they be going to see
like someone who specializes in
kind of therapist with this ten
year old child be going to see
Mr Semigran gentlelady it would
be.
Generalize Care.
Okay and is does it say that Mr
health center which is located
one block away do they know
exactly who the child is going
to see Mr speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker and gentle lady yes
they would no.
speaker I would fall again like
this morning to prove prove to
you.
That it's absolutely true lower
following Mr doing no more
following please I can't take
tactically could.
With children under fourteen if
they said I'm having sex with my
encounter foreman had I you do
insertion code number a four to
six nine about gentle rain code
J. seven three oh seven so I'm
assuming that they technically
dictate or track policies on the
surface the referral practices
are part of every medical entity
that and they're all different
so it has to be on legislation
They can go to.
The primary health care for the
prevent health care for any of
these and they can say I'm
having sex with my boyfriend.
Mr hi Mr chair of Mr speaker and
gentle lady.
The the O. H. is not involved in
questions is your boyfriend and
school is he under the age of
eighteen Mr speaker dealing and
Mr speaker and gentle lady and
and.
In late crisis intervention
so that would be harm to
themselves or others that would
fall under crisis for
interventions that correct Mr
So one is law enforcement
contacted immediately if this
chart of the child says I plan
on shooting up the school I plan
Clearly the school entities that
are in charge would be aware
okay Mister speaker dealing so
I'm gonna ask a more generalized
going to inform the parents is
that correct Mr speaker gentle
lady everything is being done
under the existing law ma'am Mr
something I want to harm herself
or others are we going to tell
the parents at that point Mr
Stewart only Mr speaker gentle
lady they need the consent of
the parents.
that if something suddenly
happened.
Thank you go to the parents Hey
there's something serious happy
with their kid or they're going
to we guarantee that they're
going to call the parent in that
situation.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
they're obliged by law to inform
the parent it's a good it can
hurt themselves or others thank
services deployment harming
yourself or others the chances
known no intended to super
depressed and we're going to
inform the parents at that time
Mr speaker gentle lady.
That that child is safe.
So Mister speaker dealing so SO
here the problems that I see
just for clarity one and that
you know we had a lot of
because are some situations
where parents definitely need to
be notified and I think that
should have been in the wording
to that the school.
Shall notify the parent in the
for support system so that's a
problem I have with that
definitely is because I want the
children's being supported by
the parents and families well
unless it's a parental problem
the emails it so in SBHC which
is for the funding for the
school based health center there
was a D. O. H. claim is a claim
being made that forty percent of
Mr speaker and gentle lady it's
my information that that
information hasn't been updated.
Okay Mister speaker delay so
that again is another issue
the school could do these things
that we were shared they weren't
being referred to mental to
Planned Parenthood apparently
they can go for abortion and
If that gets signed by the
governor's gone through
everything and that is the
public the public bodies they
cannot stop someone if they want
care provider and they say E.
you know I got pregnant I'm
really depressed about this or
and thinking about going through
gender of a for I want to gender
nothing to do with this.
Mr della it's going to because
at some point when she signs
this is exactly why we were
concerned about the public care
NY or they're getting bullied or
they're having a hard time
either depressed or.
Now we move into this round.
Where we can't stop them we

is.

Bernalillo Representative
Sarinana.
Thank you Mr speaker kind lady
to yield yes Mr speaker gentle
lady from Virginia yield thank
you Mr speaker I also want to
I let's go back to see if I can
make the this Mr speaker comedy
I love school Schoolbased health
centers because when our kids
normally go for a doctor's
appointment outside of school it
learn so when you have a school
based health center the kids are
gone at least in my screen I get
a call from the school based
health center in state markets
best time because you know when
you're teaching the quadratic
equation nobody wants to leave
the classroom but he would go he
go you go for twenty minutes he
access to primary care that he
needed.
With limited time out of the
classroom and kindly the is that
the way they're supposed to work
our school based health centers.
is that you know it's there for
them Mr speaker kind gentle lady
and that they feel comfortable
go weak the the providers are
kind
it is good for kids they get
what they need and they come to
school in the state of schools
so thank you.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
there's really to be doing for
Bernalillo No Representative
Mr speaker gentle lady one thing
I notice about.
The bill is that it seems like
we've renamed these facilities
here.
they were always school based
health clinics as a title.
Health centers rather.
Okay Mister speaker gentle lady
I guess I just been calling them
other other questions Mr speaker
gentle lady on a page three line
for.
where it says the department
If we've been operating under
national model for the
schoolbased.
Health centers for twenty five
years why do we feel the need
now.
primary health care especially
for underserved kids.
Mr speaker generally I'm sorry I
didn't catch the first part of
what you said could you repeat
that please because they have
Mr speaker gentle lady I'm sure
there have been a lot of changes
over twenty five years I have no
doubt about that.
But wouldn't critical asks us
for underserved kids be included
Mr speaker and gentle lady yes
they have thank you
So Mister speaker gentle lady on
page two line twenty five see
services with all of those
require immediate notification
of parents.
Mr speaker and gentle lady the
Pretty much every year every.
Every health clinic whether they
are a school based health clinic
or not.
Okay well I think you the gentle
lady and Mr speaker gentle lady.
So.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
Are the services at the
schoolbased clinic the same as
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
The difference between the
difference between them is the
location if I'm not mistaken is
that ranger speaker internally
you're correct okay Mister
speaker gentle lady I think
that's that's some of the
that doesn't include the parent
and the so it is the same thing
that is actually beneficial and
Have we ever been short on
funding for the school based
clinics.
Mr speaker and gentle lady yes
we have.
Mr speaker gentle lady have we
Thank you and Mister speaker and
gentle lady I'm sorry Mr speaker
gentle lady I have those clinics
re opened again.
Mr speaker gentle lady no they
have not.
but the existing number R.
seventy nine.
Okay thank you and Mister
speaker gentle lady if we've
been operating and for the most
chaired the health and Human
Services Committee over this
interim.

an understanding of which one of

Okay but existing licensing law
codifies the medical providers.
understand correctly the that
controls the medical provider
but there is no case law there
is no federal law that.
Okay so that
Stricker and gentle lady that
that clarifies that for me
because in section F. of the

no statute that exists that

is accurate.
Mr speaker and gentle lady so at

Mr speaker then.
I'm being asked to ask you to

And then we have an additional

Okay Mister speaker and
and it goes on to say that

The lady at the of read that
portion of the bill but I've
came up I started talking to
several school superintendents
around the state that.
Misinterpreted.
they could either opt in or opt
out of this.
Mr speaker and gentleman it is a
voluntary thing they can opt in
or opt out and we were supported
of we were supported with this
bill.
Pardon me just for sex.
that I am concerned Mr speaker
and gentle lady that there's
nowhere in here the allows a
school system to opt out and not

appreciate the debate and I I do

Mr speaker gentle lady just all
right and then the Mr speaker
gentle lady and continuing
online twenty two or a non

to remove simple possession from
the habitual offender sentencing
enhancements Mr speaker gentle
lady when you're talking about
controlled substance you're not
talking about cannabis correct.
gentle lady Mr speaker gentle
lady just are they moving on to
page two of the bill Mr speaker
gentle lady on that first to
that the prior bills the prior
felony conviction and the
instant felony conviction or
both for nonviolent offenses and
the justice will not be served
by imposing a mandatory sentence
that section mean Mr speaker and
gentle lady the language of red
is current language in current
law and what that means today is
the
prison Mr speaker generally what
those proper findings correct Mr
speaker and gentle lady yes with
those proper findings so Mister
speaker gentle lady that is not
instead of allowing this to
remain discretionary that we get
this kind of consideration for
property crime it could be drugs
and the second offense let's say
is nonviolent that is when this
provision comes into play in the
one here a visual enhancement as
it currently is
you're position is that you want
to take out all can possession
of controlled substances minus
eighty seven is only intending
to remove the Vigil thunder
enhancements from simple
possession so no trafficking or
distribution just simple
possession which is possession
Sabah jewel and I understand
what you're trying to do but
currently under the law the
judge would have an ability
under this to not oppose it and
is still increases the sentence
by the year but yet by a here
but yes the sentence that one
here maybe suspended yes Mr
speaker gentle lady in that one

I would.

continue to build out and expand
resources for people in New
Mexico that they have more
opportunities to seek treatment
especially in including in
noticed that that first

used to get treatment in those
types of situations with
controlled substances so I guess
opportunity for the courts to
impose treatment Mr speaker
gently.
appropriations for the one and a
half year sentence.
And Mr speaker gentle lady when
you move to part be on page two
that we're now talking about
gentle lady is that correct yes
Mr speaker gentle lady as here
asserting this is no longer
discretionary there is no
possibility for the judge to
suspend this is mandatory for
to pursue the habitual
enhancement not file it and
therefore would not apply
because it is discretionary to
file that enhancement.
Mr speaker gentle lady from what
policy that she doesn't even
file these and less
unless there's a violent crime
but need to the drug offense so
Mister speaker gentle lady I
that cannot be done Mr speaker
gentle lady Mr speaker and
gentle lady that would be
contrary to statute today but I
appreciate the intention of
those efforts Mr speaker gentle
I agree with you Mr speaker
generally there often times that
they are slide two or admitted
their identity to the two prior
felonies and they're held with
what we call in abeyance as you
and have been found to violate
their probation maybe by again
not completing residential
treatment or using or committing
a new crime that that have been
regularly with people navigating
substance use part of Mr speaker
generally my point is at is
again another discretionary role
of a prosecutor to file that
Mr speaker gentle lady the
intent of this legislation is is
not for the people where that
what are you basing that on that
it's not happening today and
district attorney's offices
across the state.
intentions of dust across the
state every but every day but
this bill is for everyone else
with where that situation as
you've described is not what's
been at play in their lives and
Mr speaker and gentle lady
I have this is my second time
being part of an effort like
this and over time we've been in
Mr speaker gentle lady when you
were the last committee one
probably three or four the
district attorneys and the
district attorney's association
called in where they said they
were in direct opposition to
the concerns of individual dust
but have not received an
official position from the
association.
All right I'm I I believe that
during that hearing Mr speaker
gentle lady the official
position from the president of
if that happens my apologies I
did not catch that again I was
Not not able to fully
participate or be there in
person my apologies.
there would be an eight year
enhancement again if it's all
within ten years correct Mr
speaker gentlelady Mr speaker
and gentle lady just.
possession of heroin that
position of hair when could not
be enhanced under your bills
correct Mr speaker gentle lady.
has to have passed a meaning Mr
speaker generally you have to
have all three of these prior
felonies within ten years it
let's take a sentence of of for
your habitual with eighteen
months under line for possession
of heroin so you have four years
in prison
mandatory and then you come out
Mister speaker gentle lady under
that situation you would have
for years and eighteen months
that's a five and a half year
sentence so it started the day
Mr speaker and gentle lady I'm
not sure if we're understanding
each other well but to say it in
a different way
the ten year and would be
completed and ended within a ten
year period so your last felony
the last day of your parole
period or your probationary
saying the same thing they were
saying the same thing and and Mr
speaker gentle lady that's what
I've experiences prosecutors
very hard to actually get to
three felonies into that ten
longer sentence earlier and then
you have another felony you
might it would be kind of hard
to make all three felony state
within that ten years to get the
and if it happens it does
happen.
So Mister speaker gentle lady
what about the case where you
have somebody who's distributed
not quite sure of the question
is as the underlying felonies or
on the official offenders that
we're attempting to limiting the
Mr speaker generally Miss Vigil
Of the Mr speaker gentle lady
methamphetamine heroin fentanyl
cocaine all those controlled
substances.
Yes Mr speaker gentle lady and
court system and through the
judicial process this is
possession for personal use yes
Mr speaker gentle lady are often
distributions of controlled
substances and trafficking of
And so they would still under
your bill just because centered
possessions and not be able to
be habitual lies Mr speaker
gentle lady.
Mr speaker and gentle lady of
please are just on to out of out
of kindness to make this
sentence less severe and to help
get treatment so do you fear
let's say under your statute you
have someone who possesses
cocaine and you want to help get
them treatment but the most you
can do under your bill is an
takes to get somebody to help
they need to get through
treatment or to get through the
programs they need to in order
to succeed with again or
treatment type
Mr speaker gentle lady so if you
have a two month sentence some
of the time these people get
placed on probation and a
treatment center is able to be
located or drug courts able to
Really productive for these
individuals in many cases Mr
speaker gentle lady Senator Mr
speaker and gentle lady is you
know they can add up to five
years probation on any of these
felony cases and I would.
figured out there ready to find
a different paths and put energy
towards a different kind of
safety and stability I hope
there's a resource and program
comes as part of a court order
or sentence so there may be
people that access treatment as
part of our appropriations a
period and then maybe people
violent felonies before somebody
has a possession
in under your situation they
can't be habitual lies even if
they're prior felonies or
violent and not for drugs Mr
felonies but not on the
possession.
Wrecked Mr speaker gentle lady
so they would get they could be
a career criminal with violent
Mr speaker and gentle lady the
intent of this bill is to
recognize that possession again
possession for personal use is
not a felony like other
felonies.
and property crimes and things
like that that also can be
involved with drug usage Mr
speaker gentle lady would you
agree or disagree with that.
so Mister speaker I have an
amendment that I'd like to
propose I believe it's been
given to you for house floor
amendment number one to Senate
Two two six two one point to
those we have it is on line it
is impassable unity to explain
the amendment what this
amendment as Mr speaker is
justice and necessary to impose
a mandatory sentence the court
may impose a mandatory a virtual
offender enhancement provided in
sections a B. or C. of the
give the judge discretion if
certain findings are made in
order for the judge to impose a
mandatory time the judge felt it
friendly amendment is our debate
on the amendment the delay from
Bernalillo in Torrance
Representative Lord thank you Mr
speaker with the gentle lady
please yield I will yield to the
what this person has all these
other extraneous factors so
therefore I'm going to get
discretion is that correct yes
Mr speaker gentle lady what it
does is it thank well I believe
this discretion anyway for the
violent felonies before hand and
I you've committed a drug
offense and it's in the best
interests of justice no make
these findings and I'm gonna use
keep criminals that probably
should be on the street out of
the street is that correct Mr
speaker gentle lady in my
opinion it would.
So I I totally understand that
offense so that is non
distribution that's distribution
of drugs speaker gently right
and Mr speaker gentle lady so I
stuck with the language that
they were uses so be for a
speaker dollars on the court I
just want to get some
clarification on this amendment
for voted on it thank you very
much thank you is included in
the amendment the gentle lady
Do you have a roll we have a
motion to table house floor
amendment number one to Senate
bill one eighty seven of one of
yes in the amendment would have
The vote is now closed by a vote
of third in the affirmative
twenty nine in the negative
house for the number one to
Senate bill one eighty seven has
it's a Vigil hand Smit bill and
what you're doing of Mr speaker
gentle lady is carving out one
felony and I see this being a
lady the D. W. why in certain
felonies that are self enhancing
under the law I I I don't like
this road that we're we're going
down taking away prosecutors
violent crimes and and you know
maybe these are all just
positions but there's a a rough
history here and Mr speaker
gentle lady maybe this is a the
defendant who has had multiple
offenders we're going down a
road we're gonna see this for
other felonies that maybe
someone else considers are
violent and so with that I
thought the amendment would be a
disappointed that that amendment
wasn't passed but this is just a
bill that amendment I cannot
support that I know prosecutors
are not supporting I'm not even
lady I would I would also just
say there is complete discretion
in section a B. and C. for a
be left to each jurisdiction and
what those prosecutors and those
judges want to do on these types
of cases and so with that I just
cannot support this bill I I

Mr speaker kind lady there's
nothing defined in statute that

correct it's about intense but
there is not a number await a

working to eliminate the

Because I think it's a moral
question about how we treat
The majority of New Mexicans
incarcerated at possession for
possession are women.
Women in our state.
When we don't have real purpose

so again I'm not trying to make

the multiple possession charges
we can no longer put on of
discretionary but realistic one
bill I thought it was my
understanding that this is a
federal law that is being broken
with possession of anything but
marijuana which is been crimped
decriminalized in the state some
court but this is just about New
Mexico state courts.
Okay thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady so then you know my big
question with this legislation
for instance Mr speaker gentle
lady but I know Mr speaker
gentle lady about eighty percent
of individuals who are
incarcerated have had problems
in the past with drugs or
Mr speaker and gentleman
there was lots of questions
rolled into that one so if I
miss one please catch me back
up.
certainly not substance use
disease of what happens in these
cases is that especially when
someone's we these are women
these are moments are on a four
conviction so these are our
people that go in struggling
our state does try to do
residential drug and alcohol
incarceration there are not
enough resources to go around
what I have heard over decades
now including this week when
crossroads for women was in town
relapse is part of addiction and
when they violate and end up
back in prison as they put it
you're in prison with other
people struggling with addiction
that are engaged in criminal
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
and I certainly can agree with
that Mr speaker gentle lady I
think it's important that we
focus on these different.
gentle lady who may be addicted
to a certain drug Frances so
Mister speaker gentle lady how
would that go into effect
regarding this legislation to
those issues all it does is
simply remove the the potential
discretionary one here and then
the mandatory for any year
felony Mr speaker gentle lady
what is a non capital felony
include Mr speaker.
Mr speaker and gentleman
anything besides everything
possessed the possessing drugs.
And then they also did something
else like they were possessing a
unregistered firearm for
instance Mr speaker gentle lady
the firearm crime and then the
enhancements that come along
with the firearm activity.
Okay thank you Mr speaker
gentleman gentleman so then
eighteen month and whatever
other charges come with that Mr
speaker gentle lady Mr speaker
gentle and they would still have
a conviction on that possession
but not the additional mandatory
It as well as no more
enhancements other than that
current charge so Mister speaker
gentle lady we couldn't say oh
well we saw prior so technically
this person has to go back for
Okay thank you Mr speaker and
gentle lady will you know.
I just under like I'm just
thinking of like a mother for
instance Mr speaker gentle lady
to prison for theft if it was
over like five hundred Bucks it
could become a felon or
something so Mister speaker
gentle lady I'm just trying to
find how this would make sure
that that person doesn't stay in
is not a fix this bill does not
address the.
Generations and generations of
trauma that New Mexicans have
navigated from all the corners
one mechanism we have so that we
can.
As others have debated today
began to take seriously and with
speaker gentleman that would do
as you suggested this is not it
but I believe it's a step in the
right direction.
Okay thank you Mr speaker and
then how much time in cars rated
could we potentially be taking
off the table total Mr speaker
gentle lady if we have the
statistics.
Mr speaker and gentleman
unfortunately The New Mexico
incarcerated today are serving
only the enhancement time.
Okay good gentlemen I would add
Okay thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady so then this could
potentially affect that fourteen
percent of the entire female
Addiction Mr speaker gentle lady
or drug charges rather Mr
speaker and gentleman yes many
many years because again as
we've shared and you understood
Okay thank you Mr speaker and
gentle lady so that I'm
guessing.
With this bill how would this be
speaker gentleman of the bill is
not retroactive.
Okay thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady so those individuals
currently serving that fourteen
speaker gentle lady so then you
know I've heard some concerns
from the district attorney's
that said this took a tool out
of their toolbox for instance I
don't know if that's the exactly
what they said but Mr speaker
are going to prison for correct
sentences things like that Mr
speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker and gentleman as it
stands today it is mandatory
for me it's about our a
statement as policy makers and
this is a move to again to treat
addiction as a disease and not I
Mr speaker gentle lady I don't
see anything in this legislation
regarding let's let's invest in
treatment programs instead of
putting people in prison let's
sentence which Mr speaker gentle
lady I would submit this
individual who may be addicted
may go back on the street make
it more even more addicted to
these drugs and Mr speaker
gentle lady do we have any
response to that concern Mr
speaker I think gentlemen and
and gentle lady I I appreciate
In particular the gentle lady
I'm sure to teach a course on
wages asked and one I'm just
going to bring us back to the
bill and the specifics of the
bill so please continue
gentleman asking questions
that it is which I agree with Mr
speaker gentle lady but
unfortunately Mr speaker gentle
lady I just don't know how this
would.
Accomplish that goal so thank
You yes this is a great deal to
the gentleman from the.

Thank you.
Mr speaker the gentle lady
please yield yes Mr speaker I
yield to the gentle lady from

that.
What treatment we're going to be
providing for these people if
we're not going to put in.
In prison on some presents a
but possession drugs again Mr
speaker gentle lady Mr speaker
and gentleman this bill does not
address that issue and again if
someone is convicted of
possession they will still be
Drug and mental health and it's
extremely frustrating because
I'm like okay.
They go eighteen months or may
may not be treatment they get
and then the other frustrating
part I have like for public
safety.
Then there's a whole other side
of it right if we have people
people because everybody I know
it's been ripped off for rob
third had their car stolen.
So again we it is one part of
the problem and there's more
back out and rob because most
people that I've known in my
lifetime that addicted drugs
don't have employment.
So somewhere they're getting
that and the other thing I have
is.
break who is doing if if you
know the because they look at
the whole picture and they are
actually doing a distribution
but they might give them.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
have consider these
possibilities of for many years
and I feel that this is the
right policy for New Mexico.
If we take away the discretion I
worry about that I really do
like that amendment because I
think sometimes there just.
People that are habitual
they're just in and they're out
to getting time served I'm
worried about the repeat
offenders on the fact that we
don't we're not saying Mr
speaker daily without saying we
guess is one part of this issue
and it's not taking care of the
whole issue which is.
If these people need help.
we're building a mega we have
center in Albuquerque or and all
the larger cities.
So I still see that one
component of I see we're going
with this and this bill but I
or people are cared for so
they're not.
Affecting the public safety
that's my biggest issue I don't
see anything to keep us.
facilities and I don't see any
of that stuff playing out into
that of anywhere how we're
wrapping anything around them to
make sure that they are getting
the treatment getting the help
staffed to supply their drug
addictions and that's not fair
on our and so I will not be able
to support this unless we had
some way to make sure that.
you know what we've rested use
home many times.
We need to use discretion and
put you as a habitual offender
Mr speaker gentle lady.
the treatment we don't have the
resources we don't have anything
for them we keep put them back
on the street and if they're
committing crimes of ten or
separate from the possession but
time we got to say okay enough
is enough and even on the
discretion if you didn't agreed
I would have collective scenes
and the like after maybe four
times five times we can choose
to put them out of the street to
where that's going to become a
public safety issue so I cannot
support this bill thank you Mr
speaker gentle lady to know for
the debate related to close Mr
parents and families in New
Mexico need I also want to
appreciate the Senate for that
thirty to five vote on this bill
can Senate passed this bill
speaker I move that the Senate
bill one eighty seven.
Do now pass final passage of
Senate bill one eighty seven the
vote is now open.
Those amount to close.
passed this house deleted from
Santa Fe Representative Romero
are you ready and item number
forty yes Mr speaker we get to
that point.
speaker Senate bill twenty nine
basically simplifies the process
that has been studied over the
interim and has involved
incapacitated or or terminally
ill what this does is create the
procedure that allows for three
different categories of inmates
infirmity illness or disease
related to aging it does not
constitute a danger to the
person's own self or decide to
society at the time to review
review and the third category of
those who might be eligible for
those who are terminally ill.
I do not constitute a major to
the person's and sell for
society of review so these are
then still be possibly barred
from consideration and other
aspects in that with that Mr
speaker I stand for questions.
from Judiciary.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady are just be very brief and
cut to the chase Mr speaker
could not be a threat to
themselves and that seems to be
in conflict with the Elizabeth
Whitfield end of life options
act which we passed a couple
effective in June of twenty
twenty one the second hole as I
see here is the.
Bill allows for a terminally ill
terminally ill patients who do
recover and are in remission and
sometimes live many years
thereafter and so it seems to me
Overcomes their condition and is
no longer term and all that they
be placed back in two states
because the rear car serrated
for the rest of their sentence
bill twenty nine
very well done with pastel can
you read the two to six number
please point two two six one six
two point two so we have and it
The federal.
Thank you Mr speaker.
The gentleman to explain the
strikes the person's own cell
for two in every instance in the
bill where that appears so
basically all they're being
provision is to insert a new
subparagraphs C. which basically
states that if if they are no
that they would be returned to
the department of corrections
for incarceration for the
remainder of their terms of that
friendly amendment.
Mr speaker it's not a friendly
amendment I'm happy to describe
to the body why not please do.
current law the would be
unfriendly and simultaneously
when you look at subsection C.
with what is being proposed
within that area we can talk to
that that would be anywhere
close to reality so we're really
just not meant needing to
legislate for that and finally
anyone that does get released is
Bernalillo in Torrance thank you
Mr speaker will the gentleman
from Chavis county please yield
Mister speaker I yield to the
lady from Bernalillo and
this Mr speaker which I probably
asked later when I get on the
board.
So would imagine you're looking
the same thing I was Mr speaker
and gentleman you're looking at
misdiagnosed I was wondering the
same thing what happens to them
if that six months there are
still alive and maybe they're in
remission or that didn't happen
gentleman Mr speaker and gentle
lady that's what the amendment
says.
Mr speaker and gentleman I
completely agree with that
because that can happen and it's
all that and six years later
they are still alive Mr speaker
dilemma so I would assume that
you are probably thinking along
the same lines at what we do I
mean now what happens are still
live at six months Mr speaker
for certain terms and has been
sent there by the judge after
hearing the evidence I can maybe
understand if they are
terminally ill why they should
several people my community who
have received terminal diagnoses
and.
released from prison because of
a terminal diagnoses and may.
For whatever reason they
overcome their illness they
either leave them.
Released into the community or
you send them back to serve
their sentence and so this
chooses to serve their sentence
with somebody who you know
Breakfast is better goes into
remission was misdiagnosed in
six months or so out there and
we need some clarity Mr speaker
for whatever reason you didn't
pass when six months you've got
better whatever that you should
just go back it's almost like a
violation of parole so to speak
so I completely understand why
you want to put this in here and
you Mr speaker will gentleman
yield please Mr speaker I yield
to the gentleman from Katrin
grams and although thank you Mr
not not a lot but enough and so
I've seen it many many times
with speaker John where people
come in to make arrangements
thinking that they won't be
around in the next few months
well put because that's what I
was going to talk about to Mr
speaker German
I don't know if your amendment
says is because I want to stay
on the amendment and I'm sorry
her or specific hospices home or
anything like that Mr speaker
German.
Mr speaker and gentleman I'm not
there's just deals with what do
you do when they with me on that
and are in remission in other
words they.
Have a.
concern is very real and so I I
support treatment thank you Mr
speaker president on the
amendment gentleman from October
Representative block thank you
your amendment here and I
totally think it's a good idea
however Mr speaker gentleman it
does say an updated diagnoses Mr
speaker gentleman I'm not sure
if the original bill requires is
Well I would think that the that
would be within that six months
because obviously there.
Supposedly let out because
they're going to be terminally
alive The New.
Somebody needs as a question are
they still terminally ill or
have they overcome that the
life expectancy of greater than
six months and they be returned
to the department of
corrections.
Okay thank you Mr speaker
sure that the individuals
they're sent they're probably in
an ankle monitor I would assume
Mr speaker gentleman is there
any kind of process currently
I'm not currently aware of what
bill money money amendment
really doesn't deal with with
what happens when they're
released other than if they get
gentleman and you know I do
agree with you I think that
there are certain instances
where someone can get over
cancer they can be some kind of
crazy on this or something and
And maybe self or to
amendment six Mr speaker Jim is
that just cleanup language.
Well it strikes those words in
An inmate would constitute a
danger to someone else because
we do have this new act on the
books that we passed in this
allowed to terminate their own
life upon release and so to to
given the fact to maybe that
speaker gentleman with this
individual be able to take
advantage of the end of life
options act.
Once they get out Mr speaker
gentleman would they be
precluded from that if they are
the corrections department
officials when they go through
this process of place that they
wanted to take advantage of the
Elizabeth Whitfield and of life
They are a danger to themselves
because of their desire would be
to in their life when they get
out.
And so.
their application to to to to
get out.
For.
The state totally silent and
then they just do it after the
after they're released Mr
Jim and so I guess would they be
able to catch that before that
would happen if this individual
would be let out at you know for
six months or something Mr
speaker gentleman
requires but I doubt very
seriously that it would get
caught to even if it does
require reporting requirements
okay thank you Mr speaker John
that's certainly a concern and I
I think that's a very good piece
of your bill or your your
amendment rather to ensure that
these individuals they are not
lying that these individuals are
they shouldn't be taken now and
the than you know if just being
able to walk upon society
especially if they may have like
a life sentence for instance Mr
Into the normal life and they
could potentially be dangerous
so Mister speaker John I
appreciate your amendment I
supported I think it's a
necessary step if we're gonna
Wreaking havoc whatever it is
that we might say and this is a
very very good amendment that I
sure hope every single person
this body considers.
Thanks about very much and then
Mr speaker I will yield to the.
Gentlelady from Bernalillo
county and my long standing
chair.
this a number of years ago and
one of your colleagues from your
side of the aisle brought up the
fact that and there was a

For many years and I don't want
And I don't think you're going.
I think you are well intentioned
I just don't think it reflects
the reality of prison health
is that well the ages of isn't

on the people who were there

To relieve the presence of this

complicating something that is
not going to be dangers to

it's a compassionate thing to do
I don't think I'm I'm virtually

Is it on the amendment to delay
from Santa Fe Mr speaker I move
to table the amendment right or
on a motion table the amendment
it amended US for roll call
votes today.
And remember.
to Senate bill twenty nine yes
in the amendment will be tabled
a vote of no we're back on the
amendment the vote is now open.
bill twenty nine has been tabled
gentleman from Chavis.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady
You know I do think that.
allow that to occur because I
think that if in the.
We want to be consistent with
respect to that issue we need to
The lady from Bernalillo towards
Representative Lord thank you Mr
speaker will the gentle lady
please yield yes all yield my
friend from C. pack.
bunch of new things on here so
bear with me as asking questions
for clarity so on this one Mr
speaker gentle lady we have
three different ways to be
so I wanted to start with the
first one on page two.
Senator Clarion clarity on Mr
speaker gentle lady.
Legislative staff.
Can somebody do a prayer some
juju or something this is.
Mr speaker delay things can go
smooth for the rest of the night
now.
Okay Mr speaker gentle lady so I
Line sixteen.
It says that they're fifty five
years or older so the first
question I had on that is what
happens of somebody just got
lady Mr speaker gentle lady this
depending on their age if
they're eligible fifty five they
would be eligible that.
Okay so just for clarity Mr
yes Mr speaker gentle lady.
Okay.
So online seventeen this is
where I get confused.
So they suffer from a
on those there lies the problem
when I look at the World Health
Organization they had things in
turn members like hearing loss
related to agents or those of
things the immense and this bill
when it says these diseases
related to aging.
Mr speaker generally I'm not
to tell me this underlined
section this section right here
seventeen as a ready.
You're saying that this is a
ready law even though it's
this is current law Mr speaker
gentle lady it's we're just
moving into this section okay
Mister speaker and LED.
Okay so if we go off of that.
They have a disease related to
aging which could be hearing
loss cataracts arthritis COPD
diabetes.
Question was the other one.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
Mr speaker gentle lady so they
must be fifty five years of age
or older and they must be
suffering from a debilitating
for them to be eligible Mr
speaker gentle lady can't just
be one term has to be all of the
above and they have to be able
because I started to think of I
don't think we want to release
if let's say Jeffrey Epstein was
still alive and he was over
fifty five and he got cataracts
In our than anybody that I
killed the kid or anything like
that I don't think we want them
to be released because they have
arthritis and that was for the
terminal so I I I do have a huge
problem with that Mr speaker
gentle lady because when looking
at related releasing somebody.
With hearing loss I don't think
neck or back pain so I have some
serious problems with this
because I don't think.
The way that this is written is
going to do what we wanted to do
I have somebody who could have
committed a horrific crime.
And now they're being released
because of this very weird
disease related to aging I mean
comes to first degree murder
wafers in prison are not here
for consideration under this
bill this bill prohibits that
speaker gentle lady the
importance of does not
constitute a danger to the
person's own self or to set to
society at the time to review
requires multiple people in
never be the case under this
law.
Mr speaker delay still see that
anybody who is eligible for
this.
Fifty five years old and suffers
that that's the type of people
that we want to be eligible for
parole.
Early parole so then the
question I had on that there was
some.
It says here when you look on
So is that going to be every
single person over fifty five
who has.
Disease related to aging are how
is that going to play out Mr
Mister speaker gentle lady that
wouldn't change any current
practice.
Okay Mister speaker gentle lady
so.
Part of the problem that I had
Is there anyone that is excluded
at all from.
This eligibility of getting this
early parole at age fifty five I
mean other than the fact they
this
Mr speaker dealing Mr speaker
gentle lady again this
completely bars inmates serving
a sentence for first degree
present an amendment because I
think that there's some people
that we absolutely should not be
released for any reason and Mr
speaker I move house floor
call vote can you please read
the two to six number.
Yes it is two six two eight zero
point one thank you Julie I
resilient especially on this one
with the geriatric and made and
age will do disease related
aging I'm looking at you with
their terminally ill people and

any crime to a child that
constitutes a sex offense of

rate is extremely high and I
have read way too many studies
and stories of.
People up into the eighties and
to be eligible for this program
Mr speaker gentle lady.
It is a family member.
Mr speaker it is not a friendly
amendment.
I have I'm happy to.
law which is been in place for
almost three decades Mr speaker
gentle lady it excludes first
degree murder you can get
released until you show that
you're not a danger to society
gentle lady so it is not
friendly.
Is there debate on the amendment
the gentle lady from Bernalillo.
tabled a vote of no and we're
back on the amendment.
The delete is as for roll call
vote the vote is now open.
floor thank you Mr speaker so
Mister speaker don't lady what I
was trying to get across is for
scream order or criminal sexual
contact for criminals and sexual
geriatric inmate I do not think
that the purpose of the should
be to let somebody out because
they have arthritis or back pain
or COPD or depression this
question I did have on this Mr
speaker gentle lady on when it
says.
On the terminal on page three
which has incurable condition
Mr speaker gentle lady so they
the first evaluation happens at
that level of corrections health
professionals there and if they
on page four witnesses every
person is over phone at fifty
five will be notified including
these people to have age related
Which is very strange on this
with the normal proliferation
appropriations will would say
somebody who was harmed by one
of these people are they going
to be notified Mr speaker gentle
lady yes Mr speaker gentle lady.
on this if how long does this
process take.
If they're notified they fill
out the paperwork and they're
going through the process how
Mr speaker gentle lady so they
would if they request to be
reviewed it'll be it'll be
thirty days for them to be able
to get a hearing and then they
timeline will very per person
and so it could take you know
anywhere from.
Many many weeks
there a liability on the
probation parole or on the
prison system or would there be
any repercussions or penalties
for that if they did not get the
person out time Mr speaker
