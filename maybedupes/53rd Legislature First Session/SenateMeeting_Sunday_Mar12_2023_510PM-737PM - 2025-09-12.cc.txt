with that Mr present house bill
two is the funding mechanism for
the state's budget.
And will stand for questions
thank you centerman centers
we're debating house
Thank you Mr president and and
the I'm not gonna just senator
Munoz to yield I just there is
one one aspect of this that I
just want to make sure.
there's one aspect of that the
does bug me and that is.
the opioid settlement money on
page two hundred forty six the
budget details how the state
for counties in and that's all
to the good.
But of the twenty one million
dollars that came to the.
To the
Date.
The FIR says house bill two is
on page four of the F. I. R.
right above the Economic
Development line this is the H.
H. B. two also uses twenty one
Not a thing to argue within that
except that's not accurate.
Because it uses fully twenty
five percent of the twenty one
million dollars for something
with with one of my colleagues
whose of the big advocate for
early childhood programming and
as we all are nobody's arguing
the child care is an important
thing to do.
percent for child care when we
have an early childhood program
that already has access to a
federal block grant for child
You hope that early I was gonna
say ten minutes more than that
for child care from the.
From the ten of block grant.
land grant permanent fund and
and and and money from that
And when we're we're desperately
in need for the opioid
settlement money to go for
actual treatment of people.
attention is being is is going
on I think is really
unfortunate.
It's not worth trying to change
the budget over but I just think
that.
recognize that we need things
besides childcare to serve these
families and to serve the
individuals a lot of the
individuals of the opioid
disorders don't have children.
that was a decision made by the.
I don't know who made that
decision maybe it was the LFC
maintenance LFC staff maybe it
was the Senate finance committee
thank you Mr president so first
I I I do want to thank the chair
of finance.
He tried to work well with us
over here try to make things
open try to make things.
the changes were coming faster
than I could keep up with them.
But in this budget I just want
to highlight a couple of things.
budget which is now fourteen
percent increase.
We have started out saying we're
going to put some money in the
what's going to happen so when
it came down to a hundred and
fifty million dollars.
People on this side of the the
chamber thought okay you know we
And then we got to seven hundred
million dollars going to the
permanent fund and then we were
stepped on again and now it's
of what we came in here thinking
we could do.
On the positive side we did
spend a billion dollars on
capital outlay projects.
There's a couple of good things
didn't sell severance tax bonds.
And that means we're not paying
any interest on that that's a
win win we got the money out
there not paying interest
beautiful.
doctors we also weren't paying
them very well.
And so we set it up so that we
would pay providers more we
would pay them chair rates at a
here that wasn't a hundred
million dollars for public
safety who can argue with public
safety we obviously have a crime
problem we've got issues let's
do it.
Some of that of course is for
New police officers.
And the idea is that we would
pay a hundred percent of the
wages for an officer in one of
Problem is we can't hire
officers today.
I don't want to be police
officers they're just not out
there.
The Economic Development
Department they got a thirteen
excuse me an eleven point three
percent increase good.
Through the course of this
session we've had a couple of
opportunities to create new
industries for New Mexico and we
keep voting those down so but
tourism can replace oil and gas
probably not.
But we put in a lot of money for
them to have a national
marketing so that we can go tell
the world that we're here come
this I said it out loud somebody
took me seriously so that we can
rake white sands and turn it
into a great Zen garden but.
There are other things that we
can do with that money.
resources department environment
department and the state
engineer.
Not quite half a billion dollars
but close to half a billion
dollars.
And there are some money in
But there's also a lot of money
in there for.
What I call the green
priorities.
And and I'm troubled by the
green priorities because the
green priority seem to be
We gave all of the public
employees that include schools
in higher ed as well as the
state employees a five percent
raise.
roads and bridges airports.
All of those kind of things.
But then we had it in this thing
called alternative energy.
It was early childhood was
mentioned a few minutes ago.
In the general fund budget we
increased the early childhood.
To.
But not only that we had that
added another hundred and ten
million dollars from the early
childhood Trust Fund.
This under four hundred percent
of poverty Mr president I
literally asked if you could
name the three people in the
state of New Mexico that did not
qualify.
today is roughly five point four
billion dollars.
It's going to be eight point
five in two years and are
probably pick out a ten billion
dollars.
And then we took another five
million dollars into it in there
from the vote opioid Madam
while.
Not sure what I feel about that.
We had some of the highlights
In that represents forty three
percent of the total budget
forty three percent of total
budget is in public at.
That also includes free food
increase in almost all of that
comes from the opportunity
scholarship so free college for
everybody New Mexico.
And that represents about twelve
point six percent of the total
budget.
those provider increases that
that we talked about earlier and
some of that is for extending
the COVID benefits that are
running out of federal budget.
Part of the budget right there
just those four that's almost
eighty seven percent of the
entire budget eighty seven
percent of those four lines.
from thirty two to twenty five
and you know we stood firm
saying nope thirty was as low as
we would go.
What we did early on is we took
the tobacco settlement money
It will grow instead of just sit
there and get smaller every
year.
So we moved it to a permanent
fund.
So thank you bro and then we
said are reserves are twenty
So Mister president I want to
end with a couple of things here
one I think the LFC did a great
job input agency budget together
If we getting the return on
investment that we expect to get
when we put money into a program
so they're going through all of
those things.
It left us with the highest
permanent fund balances every
state history.
You put us in the best shape
together took care of those
really thought about those and
and try to make sure that when
that collapse comes we can
weather that storm.
of last week or so.
Things really started to spin
out of control as various people
put pressure.
In more pressure and harder
excellent staff that's over and
LFC.
They weren't well vetted so we
put a lot of money in here.
For things that we don't know
Request to the beginning this
they came in at the end.
So in the big picture everybody
came in here no we have three
We spent about one billion on
capital outlay projects we spent
about one billion on specials
that would are to junior money
and things like that special
put in there and then we added
to our budget another billion
dollars for border budget grew
by another billion dollars.
So those are my concerns with
this budget there are some great
things in their billion dollars
in capital outlay great.
Lots of infrastructure stuff
great.
fund projects that are not
vetted and we don't know what
they are.
I think that's the poison pill
in this but I do appreciate the
chair I appreciate let's
We do have further debate
Senator Sedillo Lopez.
Thank you Mr president.
I thank the chair for making
agent available after we got
important for LFC the staff and
and so I really appreciated that
because I think that that really
showed a lot of transparency to
hope we can take up in future
years
One of them all start with the
performance measures I I I don't
know Mr chair if if US senators
and twelve are just strange of
the performance measure for
district attorneys if you look
at page eleven and twelve is
performance measures is the
district attorney's office has a
lot more to do than just detain
this is diverting resources from
actually convicting people so I
hope but I understand that is
that is an LFC question with how
those performance measures are
the agency is going to devote
devore devoted to resources
because my understanding is is
if you make your performance
measures you can get more money
page ninety nine is a
performance measure that is not
in the in control.
Of of of the agency
Is the rate of serious injuries
and illnesses caused by
workplace conditions per one
hundred workers and that's
supposed to be reduced to point
That just seems not connected to
what it is they actually do.
And then finally some of these
page one eleven of the budget.
I'll ask for clarification of it
and the performance measure is
for water protection.
Out of three hundred and seventy
seven.
I will submit to you that that
is just pitiful has a
I'm hoping that the department
does better than that
but if that's a performance
measures that's the only thing
not about the budget but I hope
that the body we'll take care of
it an agent said one thing that
we could do is perhaps have a
zoom where the performance
measures are discussed in
The other thing I wanted to say
is I've been trying to track the
because half of the the liquor
for recovery and it was very
very difficult to do and so I
hope that the something that is
in the house tax bill which is
alcohol treatment so we won't
have such a difficult time this
is particularly important when
we are the number one in the
country in alcohol related
deaths.
and I'm very happy that they're
getting of of of an increase in
my understanding is is that it's
a.
lower rate of workers has you
recall and I'm not making an
amendment or anything I'm not
offer an amendment but if you
recall last year we got a
commitment which I think was was
I think one other thing that we
could do for them because.
The lower paid employees have
state so one idea of it is not
in this budget but I hope we
think about it for the future is
perhaps a retention bonus system
where that maybe someone of
one would get five hundred bonus
those are things I've talked
about was state workers and the
reason I raise this is it's not
so much but I want to compliment
the committee for all of the
work that goes into it I know
it's a lot of work and I want to
compliment the the chair for
In finance but I really
appreciate all of the work that
into went into it by the staff
Followed by Senator Shendo
etcetera cels.
Thank you Mr president.
four on the reserves money going
to our institutions.
twenty six million six hundred
ninety six thousand four hundred
dollars for the universe in New
Mexico thirteen million to New
Mexico state and nine million to
will yield and that number is
calculated based on the number
of research dollars they were
getting into the institutions so
that's how we calculate that
math and then in an appropriate
whatever amount was decided they
got the same proportion.
Semenya's Mr president center
yes.
Mr president center on that
allocation the house to the
Mr president and senator I was
just on the phone with the
secretary and she indicated that
this was a decision that was
made totally by the LFC is that
correct.
two and they did the
calculations over there so they
decided how they were going to
be spent.
So Mister president and senator
was this discussed during the
Mr president center the money
was been sitting there and the
wasn't appropriated last year
Mr president then Senator where
the universities consulted as to
whether this was appropriate or
Cup the council university
president as to whether these
the comments positive in support
or did did they think that this
was a fair calculation.
Sentiment is.
accurate in that I know New
Mexico state and tech believe
that they would have been under
funded and shorted on this
compared to what you NM is
getting up again is there a
as to how much each one's going
to get.
Centerman us Mr president we're
gonna look at that number but
universities in those dollar
amounts we're looking in volume
three right now to get you an
answer on on on some of these
questions Center viewing a hold
on a minute or you want to go to
research programs with money
going to higher education force
consortium programs that span
across the research universities
yet never got a hearing on how
already appropriated and on a
gentleman's word when things are
programmed in the house we don't
usually change them around in
the Senate that causes confusion
determined that they were gonna
appropriate and in that way.
So Mister president because I'm
a Senator that I don't get that
have any input on to how
research dollars are spent.
on appropriated and the House
determines when the budget comes
in that forty million was just
sitting there and they
determined that they wanted
propane in that manner
that they are taking up these
kinds of projects of the couple
of projects that I'm
particularly talking about are
ones that were part of last
Mr presence in center
Representative can you put your
question.
Mr president I I guess what I'm
asking I'm not sure I've I made
dollars that sat in finance
committee last year and we're
not put into the budgets any
place
I'm sorry center they're handing
the sheets and so ask me that
question again.
Senator souls and I do have an
answer the previous question
reminder to go to the chair
three on page one I you'll see
how research dollars are in
institutions and we base that
they House base that on the
percentage of a research dollars
of the universities are getting
it's fourteen percent those are
the only in wars New Mexico.
Last four and there's only four
institutions that have that
Senator so Mister president
senator I guess what I'm
concerned is because you NM is
historically been funded for
higher levels research they are
historically always going to be
funded for higher levels of
research.
Senator souls Mr president
senator that again doesn't seem
very fair and when we got a
finance committee that spends
lots of time to the interim it
country is becoming more of
consortium where multiple
institutions work together that
maybe we ought to have a
different mechanism for funding
research into the future that
Mr president and you know that
those are some of the specific
questions I last night no
actually this morning went
through the entire budget in ad
I think that's very problematic
the finance committee or the
LFC is an unelected body that is
that are supposed to be making
that those decisions there are
several places where it appears
that money going to the early
fund that's been a concern I've
had from the very start there
are multiple places where policy
decisions on education are being
Budgets are moral documents.
They reflect what we think.
Our important.
The things they consistently
tell me is a clean healthy
environment.
This this budget focus on a
clean healthy environment.
They want to talk to me to make
their own health care decisions.
They want the ability to raise
families healthy safe

traumatized New Mexico is second
only to Arizona in the number of
our students.

We are not a poor state we're
wealthy.
We have cash reserves.
ninety six million dollars.
Historically cash reserves have
been between twelve and fifteen
percent but over the last couple
of years we've been told that we
If the cash reserves were at
what is historically been twelve
to fifteen percent.
That would be free up one point
Why are we afraid of the future.
Why are we afraid of funding our
priorities.
Most of us have Appropration
But we didn't.
If we reduce cash reserves to
twenty five percent it would
free up four hundred and eighty
really reflect our priorities.
Are we moving New Mexico forward
with this budget.
Funding some programs that put
more money towards the districts
that have the students with the
highest need that's a good
thing.
In poverty we have twenty four
percent of our children living
in poverty compared with
seventeen percent nationally.
And we put money where it needs
to be that we have done some
things we put money into the
child tax credit that is known
to work to move people out of
prop poverty.

we could have done so much more.
I'm disappointed that we didn't
do more.
Thank you Mr president the I was
looking at the budget appreciate

Mr president we do have further
president yes it will Senator
Representative others present
thank you senator and.
Awesome questions in just a
minute but I did want to little
talk a little bit on what the
appropriation bills that have
gone through Tax committee on
through Education Committee and
and really because we're in the
Senate never had a chance.
And so I think the the chairman
of said education for bringing
that up I think it is something
that's very frustrating how that
process works I think it's very
have any idea what's going on
when it comes to the budget I do
appreciate you know the homework
assignment last night by Senator
Wirth and you know lots of
appreciate that
we can have a slumber party
those are souls that would've
been a lot of fun you know we're
both in education you know
within a great thing anyway
The finance committee had voted.
On a budget.
And then all of a sudden we
start hearing these rumblings in
the budget was pulled back in.
Semenya's Mr presence and that's
a very good question yesterday
we were trying to work with the
last couple of days we're trying

And I know you you want to

Yeah we don't really want the

that.
But I do know the script if we
ever want to do that everyone I
got it my drawer ready anytime
Committee should have been sent
that policy what was the issue
with the extended learning can
can you kind of explain what it
was and what we ended up with.
you did daisies which the LFC
bill did and which I think the
legislature was pushing for
that that was worked out and we
when we do ours we need to set
aside time for teachers to do an

what they're called and so
Takes off all that and and the

directly that came through Sen
Education Committee.
Mr president center of the next
bill on your sheet
is that bill that dealt with
that.
It was a mix of both.
Present center thank you for
sheet that
the bill the decides that here
next
but that's for the K. twelve
plus program.
least on this issue and is that
going to be left available for
the districts to decide how to
use that how much of that's
going to be allowed for it's
get make sure give you the right
answer correct thank you Mr
president so our desert going to
be any local option as to how
those extra hours are used when
Twelve plus so that's an extra
twenty five days.
how's that working Mr president
in house bill one thirty which
is the next bill I think we're
one thirty but the funding for
that is in the budget so I'm not
sure you can talk about one
without talking about the other
it's like you know the they're
conjoined twins.
are the policy makers and house
bill one thirty was a policy
that the legislature decided
that they were going to do now
in house bill two in the
language it doesn't say it
president so then the budget is
just covered as extended
learning the policy will come
later but I thought the whole
problem was a policy issue
that.
Mr president etcetera it was
very conflicted day yesterday.
And when we make policy that's
where it should be but there was
little bit more in obviously
we'll have several questions
around house bill one thirty
when we get there

From Bernalillo president
Senator and and Mr Abbey thank
you for helping me deal with
And I didn't see that we
addressed it in this budget and
so it's something we probably
need to look at the future and
that's with our curriculum how
do we fund curriculum for the
Mr present center out in the
education field we call textbook
curriculum so you know it's it's
for both text books as well as
other curriculums used in the
Factors in the funding formula
student has the textbook.
And curriculum costs the same
that I think the Yazzie Martinez
lawsuit makes very clear our
responsibility the state not the
responsibility of the districts
Is that per student cost doesn't
change no matter the student
it's the same curriculum costs
if you're in the special needs
as it is if you're in a regular
just doesn't work right through
the funding formula so that
maybe just be a personal
disagreement but as I've talked
to a lot of districts they
agree.
And so I think that's something
in the future we really need to
There are certain things that
just need to be fund the below
the line per pupil and
curriculum is one of those
things
members and the executive and I
know you've done you know
yeoman's work so I do thank you
for that
No okay week away from being

little late to start making

wondering is if it's in if this
is an house bill two already.

me we put in two hundred fifty
two more million in it and.
Think about that in a minute yes
Mr president center yeah let let
us look at that we're digging
through to see how you're doing
that we may send somebody over
to clarify that real quick
it is the two million for the
species of the greatest concern.
And I noticed in the budget.
and fish with the ear tag of two
million for the species of
greatest concern so the new
printing came out that way.
million came over from the house
with that language
and talking the game and fish
there is a nother bill we voted
short of money and so we added
the additional five million to
offset some of their license

development and I I heard you
mention it's it's thirty hours
for middle school high school
where is that the bill.
Senator Mr president Senator
it originally page three lines.
I don't know the line type
politics I'm looking at the
amendments and contacts this is
elementary they're the furthest
away from the eleven forty
requirement and they're the ones
that have increased professional
development right now for our
be up to thirty hours if they
don't do the home visiting and
the parent teacher conference
that they do it elementary
they're not in the middle of
this kind of training they're
development for middle and high.
Thank you madam president
Sorry Mr president.
I did pull up on here I was like
you looking at the amendments
and context and that's not in it
because it was just put on today
collaboration time they still
need to have
maybe maybe not at the high
school level but I really don't
understand this on the middle
school level
So Mister president there there
is a there is the ability for
local districts to use current
professional development time
that they have this is not all
the professional development
entire session this is been a
back and forth among
legislators among the school
districts among the
administration about whether or
of this you and I both know
serving on L. E. S. C. and
hearing about no time to lose
that professional development is
crucial the collaboration of
legislative process that has
produced this I think it's a
good amendment it was one that I
suggested frankly to try to get
us over the finish line with
Senator right.
Mister president senator I I
have to disagree with you on
that.
and we've disagreed occasionally
on education stuff most time we
actually agree on education
finance committee the the change
the US and I'm not saying no one
on the finance committee
understands education but that's
really not their expertise it's
really not the bailiwick
already.
They spend a lot more time in
collaboration a lot more time
and professional development
collaboration time that we've
been talking about for the last
ten years.
As you look at other countries
they just don't spend that much
time with kids in the seats they
if they have that collaboration
time they can come together
during the school day and say
you know we've got this one
student that we all share of
let's let's put together a plan
that away from middle school.
How may not be as the lead high
school but I think it is the the
high school and I think every
study that we've looked at over
change this I think that the
right answers to keep it the way
it was now I don't know if maybe
the executive said she wouldn't
sign it that way.
But the fact of the matter is
But when we increase these hours
we will have one of the most
hours in educational
instructional time as any state
in the country.
need to improve the quality and
we're not holding the the
colleges accountable for getting
quality teachers to us.
Then we're just going to be
don't know that I export without
amendment on there.
and it's it is something that
that I thought was well needed
when it came to giving that
extra time for collaboration and
and it's been changed by the
finance committee so I'll listen
to further debate and I I think
it'll work on them thank you.
and then I don't have a copy of
the amendment I can't find it in
the book and I don't have on my
desk so I'd appreciate if we
could get that passed out or
find a copy for me.
Senator Pirtle copies are being
Yes and thank you Mr president
Senator is there going to be
a requirement of some type of
study of schools that do this
scores or learning or whatever
metric we want to use to to
measure is there language in
this bill for that Senator

have more testing from the
federal government from the

wondering where the tension was
between the instruction hours

that's great I really appreciate
the the straightforward
amendment Senator Brandt to
close on the amendment.
Thank you Mr president and
members of the body.
I I hope that you understand.
we we bore professional
development time.
I think we're we have a
consensus.
Within everyone in the education
community is that we need more
Originally this bill we had
set aside sixty hours.
For all grade levels to use for
that one thing that we all agree
more instructional time than any
other state in any other
country.
So we're already doing more do
we think adding more of that

will have more time to
collaborate more time to work
together more time to to hone
their craft to do a better job
in the classroom.
To take half of that time off.

finance this morning in the
education community.

with the fact that professional

levels is more significant and
but we have to do that for

begin to expand that on up
