because uh we're gonna, we're on
the floor at 11, so I'm gonna
ask everyone who is presenting
today and all our members asking
questions, uh, to, to be
concise, so that we can make
sure that everyone gets to have,
have a hearing since this is our
last meeting, said our souls,
come on.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Are you
ready for me to
Thank you. Um,
Throughout this last, this
session, you know, we've done,
we've talked about a wide range
of topics, uh, everyone knows
one of my main areas is
children, it's kids, uh, what
are we doing for all of them and
I get very frustrated because we
spend a lot of time talking
about the adult problems, uh,
and we don't spend as much time
talking about the actual kid
problems and how to prevent the
problems. Uh, we spent a lot of
time in this session talking
about CYFD and all the problems
that CY
IFD but little time about how do
we prevent kids from getting
into the foster care system. How
do we prevent kids from having
the trauma and the, the bad home
lives that result in going into
the CYFD system. Uh, we talk
about food insecurity, but we
don't talk about how are we
going to solve the problems or
fix that. Uh, we talked about
homelessness, but we don't talk
much about what are we actually
going to
do to solve the problems, we put
band-aids on top of it, and we
spend a lot of time talking
about the adult problems. Uh,
Senate Joint resolution would be
a constitutional amendment.
That would put into our
Constitution, our aspirational
guide for what runs the state.
With a focus on what we should
be doing and could be doing for
children.
Um, and so, as many of the, you
know, I think it started with
the Bill of Rights. People tend
to put 10 things into those. And
so these are 10 things.
On what we as a state should be
doing to ensure all of our
children have a best chance at
life regardless of where they
start off. And so, and I would
ask how many of you would
disagree with these different
points that all children should
have a right to medical and
dental healthcare that's
accessible.
Seems pretty straightforward.
But we don't do it.
We don't have accessible health
care for all of the children,
um, and even if it's accessible,
it's not timely.
Uh, appointments are long, you
know, we, we regularly talk
about, we care about kids.
But our actions don't typically
show it.
The second one, a right to
behavioral healthcare, that
solution focused culturally
sensitive and available to all
children and families.
Very aspirational, but we
certainly don't do it.
And I regularly tell people, we
are a wealthy state.
We have huge cash reserves. We
have lots of money that over the
last couple of years, we've been
stuffing in the mattresses.
When we have kids,
And needs and behavioral health.
And we do a little bit. We limit
our budget to 6%.
in a wealthy state.
Anybody disagree that all
children should have food?
How many children should go
hungry tonight in New Mexico.
Because we have a lot to do.
And that's on us.
Right to stable, healthy
housing.
Which kids
should go without housing
tonight.
We as the adults allow that.
We've spent precious little time
talking about children that are
unhoused during this legislative
session.
It's easy to talk about, we care
about kids. Are we going to do
anything about it?
Right to transportation. That
one seems a little
Off to some people initially,
but if you don't have a
mechanism for getting to
healthcare, to getting to food,
to getting to school, you know,
that you don't have access to
transportation, you can't access
lots of the services that we do
have available within our state.
Right to live in a community
that provides home visitation
programs. Our early childhood
education and care department
has been doing lots for early
childhood visitation programs.
But they're not accessible to
all children.
and all families who want to
eat.
They're accessible in some
areas. They have long wait
lines.
Early childhood learning
programs, prepare children for
schools. We spend a lot of time
talking about child care so that
we can get the adults back to
work.
Without providing high quality
early childhood education.
Uh, one of the things I point
out to people, we've got a star
system for how we measure our
early childhood programs, and we
subsidize 1 and 2 star programs
when the highest level programs
are 5 star. Why is the state are
we subsidizing what we know is
lesser quality for some kids.
Recently, the, I had the staff
of the LESC do kind of a secret
shopper type thing about trying
to get early childhood education
programs for young infants and
kids.
There were none.
Available in Santa Fe.
And one that said we might have
some openings and required a
substantial down payment.
To hold the spot if it became
available. And certainly out in
the hinterlands of New Mexico in
reserve in Mosheto, there are
none.
There are no providers for kids.
We talk about, do we care about
kids, but do we put our money
where our mouths are?
Right to fully resourced
community schools with staffing.
I actually believe we're making
some real progress in this area.
We're making progress in some of
these areas.
But it seems like it's often an
afterthought rather than
something that we would enshrine
in the Constitution because we
truly believe that children are
the future of New Mexico and
deserve.
A, a good life regardless of the
affluence of their parents.
The right to youth mentorship
programs. There was some long
discussions yesterday in about
how we need to have more
mentors.
Are we supporting those
programs? Do we give money to
big brothers and Big Sisters,
for instance, which is often
considered the gold standard.
A mentoring programs.
They struggle to raise money all
the time, yet they provide a
valuable service for our kids,
you know, and how many of us
have stepped up to be a mentor
for another, for a child.
And the number 10, you're right
to acquire all the skills needed
to maintain quality employment,
not minimum wage employment
where you're always struggling,
where the next generation is
going to have the same problems,
but real employment. A couple of
years ago in education, uh,
Mark Tucker, one of the things
that he would often say is, as a
state, you get two choices. You
can have high wages.
And high high required
education, high skill, high
skill, high wages, or low skill,
low wages. You don't get both.
You don't get low wages with a
high-skilled job.
Are we working towards ensuring
everybody has an opportunity for
high skill, high wage jobs that
they're able to then support a
family and such.
And so I propose this. I know
it's aspirational. I know
there's no chance in this
session that it's going all the
way through. I was reading an
interesting article, uh,
yesterday about the
People who don't understand
statistics, it's like, well,
either this will get through or
it won't get through.
Somebody's like, well, yeah,
that's right. It's like, so I
have a 50% shot, right?
Like, well, that's not how
statistics and data works, and
so I, you know, pick me up off
the floor if this were by magic
to get all the way through, but
I think it's important that we
have a discussion about where do
we put our money and our efforts
in the state of New Mexico. Do
we truly care about kids, in
which case we would not tolerate
kids who don't have food, don't
have a place to sleep.
Don't have medical care, don't
have access to be and their
parents to behavioral health and
on down the list.
And so, there's no way I'm not
so delusional to think that if
we enshrined this in the
Constitution that suddenly the
next year, all kids would be
wonderful in the state of New
Mexico.
But putting something like this
in the Constitution reminds us
about the aspiration that we
should be taking care of our
children first, and then dealing
with all of the adult problems.
So, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator. We did not
have anyone signed up in support
or opposition. Uh, would anyone
like to raise their hand to
indicate support?
But anyone like to raise their
hand to indicate opposition.
Right, see then members of the
committee.
They are diagnosed.
And chairing Senator, as you
know, I'm on the school board.
I'm looking through your list.
And we already do this public
school. I've been in the
minority my whole life. You've
been the majority of your whole
life. We continue to give money
to public aid and the schools to
do these things.
We haven't got there. The reason
I think we're not there, the
reason you guys come every year
asking for more. I think the
majority of it is your
nonprofits. I think we need to
be able to streamline the money
to the child.
Not to the adults.
I think you've got really good
thought.
I think it's watered down
because we do this every year.
In a different bill.
But every year we're looking for
more for kids. Do they deserve
it? I looked through this in new
schools.
Does the majority of these
topics already, we are a small
district in southeast New
Mexico.
And it sounds like maybe Las
Cruces, Albuquerque.
Santa Fe are your problems.
Uh, have you looked at dealing
with just the schools that
aren't providing these services.
Madam chair and Senator,
the schools are part of where
these things often get actually
to the child, but this is not
focused on the, on education
solely. This really is focused
on community and building
healthy communities. We
certainly have some pockets
around the state that have very
good healthy communities for
kids and other things. We have
others, and it really isn't just
Albuquerque, Las Cruces, or
others. We have parts of Las
Cruces that do great. There are
parts of Albuquerque where good
life for kids. They're doing
great. There are other parts
that aren't. We have parts out
in rural New Mexico where it is
not a healthy environment for
children. They don't have access
to, to food and shelter and uh
medical care and all kinds of
other things, partly because of
the isolation. And so this
really isn't a public education
bill. This really is something
that
We as New Mexicans need to
believe that we care about all
of the kids.
Senator, I guess, maybe I
misunderstood you, you're asking
us if anyone's gonna go hungry
tonight or sleep outside. Uh, I
look at my district on that
school board. I did not know
when I got on the school board,
if there's someone needs
reading.
My job
I mean
Because it's our students.
So we fulfill the void, and I
just can't understand when a
small school in a small
community does it.
Why are we asking for more?
If which should already be done
and I, and I just, I guess I
can't understand that because
I'm not in a large district.
Because we've got 724 kids K-12.
A lot
But each one matters to us.
I just wonder why, why the other
communities don't care if
they've got 300.
3000.
Each one of the kids should
matter. I just I'm wondering for
the breakdown is there again,
um, I've been in the minority
the whole time I've been in
legislator all my whole life.
And we continue to get things
passed through here that you
guys are gonna say resolve
these.
And then next year you come up
with another answer and another
answer. At what point do we look
at what's broken in the system.
And where the adults are going
with this money, and that's my
only point. I just think that,
uh, instead of focusing on what
we're gonna do with more.
How do we get that money to
actually do the children.
With that on you, Madam chair.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Townsend,
followed by Senator Stewart and
Senator Branley. Thank you.
the chair.
Thank you, Senator Sos. Um,
continued passion for this is uh
One that I admire.
Um
We might not agree on the
processes that we choose, but I
do, uh, I, I do admire the, the.
Constant push. Um, I think
that's, that's to be admired.
Your
You're um
Resolution talks about rights.
Rights
As legal.
definition
It's something that I think has
to be addressed.
Um
On the Patreon 25, you talked
about children have the right to
medical and dental care.
Is it, are you envisioning
envisioning that being
At no cost.
Equally provided, what are, what
does that right mean to you?
and senator, uh,
It doesn't specify how, uh, and,
and shouldn't in the
constitutional. Constitution
should be aspirational that we
are striving towards. Um, but
the child's right should be
regardless of the affluence of
the parents. Uh, and so I'm not
saying that, you know, wealthy
children that their parents,
they should have free medical
care, but because a child is
poor, doesn't mean they
shouldn't get medical care. All
of them, it's not
Their choice or their fault, who
their parents were, you know,
you can't blame them for
choosing bad parents. Uh, if the
parents aren't able to. And so I
think it's a incumbent upon us
to ensure that they have medical
and dental care, uh, not based
on whether they can afford it,
but based on that it's their
right to have such as a child.
Now, we as adults can decide
what that ought to be as far as
whether the parents can afford.
afforded or not afforded, the
child doesn't get that choice.
And so
Madam chair and senator.
This right
Is that something that the child
Matts
Or is it something that
The government prescribes.
Because when you think of a
seven year old child, for
example, and, and we're gonna
say they have dental care and
they have all this stuff for 7
years old.
I remember when mine were 7
years old, you had to follow him
to the bathroom, make sure they
brush their teeth.
I'm not for sure they have the
life experiences at that time to
say,
This is what I need. So who
decides?
The need that they have or the
right that is going to be
imposed on.
Madam Chair and senator, I, I
think that's the adult's
responsibility, and that is us
as the legislature and as the
people of New Mexico. Uh, we
can't blame the child. Yeah, we
need to make sure that, you
know, they are, they have the
They're able to be healthy. They
get whatever health care that
they need. You know, when you
get to be an adult, if you
decide I'm not gonna have
insurance, I'm just gonna roll
the dice. That's an adult
decision. Children don't, you
know, we have the responsibility
to manage that for them.
So, in a legal term, when you,
when you talk about your rights.
At what point in your
process this this is a child.
Outgrow those rights.
Madam Chair, I think we have
defined children as under 18
years old.
And until they turn 18, it's our
responsibility, and I think we
do that in education and a
number of other places that they
don't have the full rights that
adults do that we make choices
and decisions on their behalf,
their behalf. I noticed in the
FIR on this that I
It's been a lot like a lot of
other FIRs I've seen, they were
pretty skimpy.
Um
This term I think we all can
agree on that, but
If these
were to be provided.
The cost
If it was borne by taxpayers,
it's got to be a big number.
I mean, it's
You're taking, you're taking
costs that are on private
insurance today for many
children.
You, you're, you're gonna move
it over to whoever is the
responsible party for imposing
the right.
And that's gonna be a huge
number. I, I, uh,
I uh
I think I understand.
Oh, you desire and your push.
I, I think, um,
I think it has some implications
that I don't know that we even
can comprehend right now because
If you give a child a ride and
at what point, who, who's going
to, who's gonna make sure those
rights are upheld. Does that
child have a right to litigate
whether his
Services were equal to
My neighbor's services.
If my neighbor doesn't need
Help with those services.
Um
It looks like you're
2 children they're at odds as to
what.
But
Value those rights have and the
impact to the family if, if you
gave my child all those services
for free, and her child
Uh, was provided for by private
insurance. There's a
There's a
Balancing. There's a problem
there that I think you gotta
work through.
I um
I think I know exactly what
you're trying to do. I can't
support it under this context,
but I certainly
None of us want to see children.
Go to
be without.
The belly swollen and
opportunities of about him. I
think we have many opportunities
in the legislator to provide
opportunities for children and
families.
And on one hand, when we're
raising their costs and on the
other hand, we're trying to
provide for him. It puts us in a
conflict, and I, I appreciate
it, Senator. I really do
appreciate you bringing the bill
forward. Thank you, Madam Chair,
if I might respond because you'd
asked about the cost and I've
actually done some back of the
envelope if, if, if that's all
right, Madam Chair.
very quickly just because we're
gonna have limited time to get
through all of our matters.
I, I actually had calculated the
biggest cost in all of this is
the housing, uh, which is about
2/3 to 3/4, but it, for the
state of New Mexico to
Reach the aspiration of this for
all children. I had calculated
it'd be about a billion dollars
a year, yeah.
1 billion a year, the vast
majority is in the housing area.
Some of these are relatively
inexpensive, others more
expensive, about 1 billion, uh,
kind of the main thing is, you
know, the children shouldn't be
punished because they chose bad
parents.
Or, you know, chose a family
that wasn't affluent.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Stewart.
Thank you, madam chair.
Good morning.
didn't we all see each other
about 6 hours ago or 7 hours or
something, 1:30 in the morning.
Oh
So
You know, I, I don't have any
problem with what you're
proposing. Have a little bit of
a problem thinking that we're
not already trying to do this,
all of us.
I mean, we have different ways
to do it, um, our two parties
are not aligned on some things.
I think we're more aligned on
education than almost anything
else. That's why I enjoyed the
LESC interim committee so much
is that
You know, it's just not
partisan.
Uh, so, I mean, I, I just feel
like for 30 years, this has been
my focus, and I think it's true
of all of us.
So, you know, if Michael Padilla
were here, he would say, oh,
we've already taken care of
number 3 with all my bills to
make sure everybody gets fed.
Um, so all of us could pick one
of these things I've been
working on this forever. Um,
So
I don't know it. I'm a little
confused by the final section,
um, but no none of this takes
effect until we enact laws.
I mean
we've got plenty of logs.
Um
So
I don't know. I, I just have a
little trouble thinking that
we're, we're failing kids
because we're not doing this uh
more.
I mean, many, many years we have
not had much revenue, and we've
struggled through that.
Now, thanks to oil and gas in
large part, we have a lot of
revenue, and I believe we're
trying as hard as we can to put
it where we need it. Early
childhood.
I mean, the, the changes to the
SCG are so significant, um,
we've done 2 years of work on
special ed in the I wouldn't
even schedule or hear the office
of Special ed bill that I
offered this year through the
governor. So, you know, it is
politics when you get right down
to it, the disagreement between
the two parties, uh, the effort
of having to work with the
executive, no matter who they
are.
Uh, so I
I, I am more optimistic, I
think, than most, um, I think
we're, we're moving forward on
these, um, and I, I think both
parties are moving forward on
this,
but that really shows you how
optimistic I am.
Um
So I don't, you know, comment a
little bit if you would so on
why that bee is in there and
what it really means.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair, and,
and, uh, Senate Protem, uh, that
was the council service
indicated that needed to be in
there. Part of the reason
because if this were to pass, as
it is, then it requires us right
now we have to do this or we're
in violation of the
Constitution. And so, and I
agreed, putting that in there
means that we need to ensure
every year that we are working
towards all of these goals, but
that you don't have to do it.
next year.
Did you need to be headed that
direction that you need to be
focused on those types of
things. Uh, there are several
similar kinds of areas in the
Constitution where we don't
follow to the letter what it
says, but we're enacting laws
that are in line with what's in
the Constitution. And so that
provision really is that we are
working on enacting laws that
are in line with what is in
here.
And, and I don't disagree with
you that we are working on and
making progress in many of these
areas.
Well, Madam Chair, I, I sit, I
just can't, I
You know, I can just pick one of
these, the, uh, I just continue
to go back to number 3, the
right to nutritious food without
having ginger hunger. In this
budget, we've got 30 million or
uh food deserts and food
insecurity because of center
Michael Padilla, uh, we have
healthy meals and lots of money
to do that. I don't know what
else we would need to do. So,
you know, in, in a way, I just,
I just disagree with your
premise that.
We're failing, so thoroughly,
that's what it feels like to me
is that we're sailing on all
these areas, and I could go
through and give you what we've
done in each area. Is it enough?
No, it'll never be enough.
No, it's, it'll never be enough.
Um, so, I just, I feel like
we're moving forward to try to
address these every day in the
Senate with what we're
proposing.
So it doesn't all pass. It's not
all good.
Both parties have crappy bills.
Uh, both parties have good
films, so I just, I, I, I'm just
having a little trouble with the
premise behind what you're
proposing. I, I believe in all
of these. Uh, you left out the
right to read, uh, but, uh, I'm
assuming that's subsumed in
number 10, though it doesn't say
it, uh, it's certainly what I've
been talking about for many
years. I believe children have
the right to learn to read, and
now that we know definitively
how to do that. I'm trying to
push us in that direction as of
many of us. Uh, so,
I don't know. I just, it's the
premise that I just don't agree
with that we're, we're failing
our kids all the time. That's
just what I hear behind your
voice. Uh, you know, I've, I've
taken that ACEs test. I'm a big
old 6. You know, everybody says,
oh my gosh, if you're over 2 or
3 on the ACEs, you're gonna fail
as an adult.
I don't feel like a failure.
Uh, I feel like I've been able
to be resilient and move past my
upbringing, which was not good.
So, I, I don't, I don't think
that we're failing our kids. I
think that we are doing as much
as we can.
Given who we are and with the
the circumstances now, and with
the politics right now. Uh, I
think that the New Mexico
legislature is one of the places
that we, we
Provide
for kids in many different ways.
So I don't have any problem with
this being, uh,
In the statute, I have a lot of
problem with the, um, cause I, I
don't think
I, I just think we've been
moving forward on all these
areas, and I, I just can't think
of that many more pills we need
to do. We need to do more with
behavioral health. And we as
body this year, I mean, it's
just stunning what we all did,
uh, with our new proposal for
behavioral health, bringing
everyone in, regionalizing the
state and putting money into
each entity that needs to work
together. I just feel there's
more working together that we
need to do. I
don't think this uh makes us do
that. I, I, I, I sort of feel
bad listening to you, thinking
that we're failing on all these
areas, cause that's kind of what
I hear behind your voice. And of
course, you and I talk all the
time, so, uh, you know, we, we
both feel we're failing in a lot
of ways, but
But that's, that's not my main
motivation or my name feel about
what we're doing up here and how
we're working together, so.
Anyway, that was long winded. I
apologize, Ma'am chair.
So Brinley.
Thank you, Madam chair. Thank
you, Senator, for bringing this
forward.
Senator, you're talking about
right.
But then you list.
Really goods and services.
Transportation, housing.
Youth programs, but rights do
not come at a cost. rights or
freedoms that don't come at a
cost. So this, this list that
you've presented us that every
child in New Mexico should have
or is not necessarily
inalienable rights.
But responsibilities that the
legislators should
should accomplish and should
provide these opportunities.
For the citizens and, and the
youth of New Mexico. And I too,
as I look through this list,
they will, well, what on here?
Is the legislator ignoring or
refusing to do and, and, and I
can go down the list and say,
well, what have we been doing
for not just the last 60 days,
but, but many years. You talk
about uh access to, to
healthcare. Well, most of our,
most of our youth in the state
of New Mexico have free
healthcare. They're on some sort
of Medicaid program. We offer
school-based health clinics in
schools as we should, um, we, we
nutritious and adequate food, of
course, you're not gonna find
anyone who, who wants hungry
children in New Mexico, and
because of
That. We have free universal
meals in every school in the
state of New Mexico. We offer
pre-K, we offer free education,
for goodness' sakes, at this
point, we offer free college for
youth as they continue on.
housing programs we have a ton
of investment in money and
affordable housing throughout
the state.
And then
The problem is not that the
legislator is not making
investments and wants to see,
are you succeed?
It is that there are rules and
regulations, in my opinion, that
stifle prosperity, and it is our
job as legislators to say.
Where are the silos? Why are the
investments that we are making.
Not making a difference or not
reaching a target.
It's because New Mexico
continues to operate in this
poverty mindset.
We, for goodness sakes, are
passing a $10 billion budget,
half of which 4.7 is going to
education and many.
Many funding sources for these
that you, you specifically
mentioned.
To, to want to take this out.
To the voters to ask their
opinion, if we think that we
should meet the needs of
Of our children is, is foolish.
Of course they do. It's why they
elected us. That's why they sent
us here. We have been mandated
by our voters to create an
opportunity for our children,
and as we wrap up here, it's,
it's a little bit of a gut punch
to say, well, we're not doing
that.
And I would have to push back a
little and say we are.
We need to identify the failures
of maybe why we are not seeing
the outcomes, but the
investment.
is there. New Mexico is a
wealthy, wealthy, wealthy state.
And the investment has been made
and I think that those
legislators we wrap up should
give ourselves
Credit
For where we're putting this
money and still continue to
fight to identify if the
outcomes that we are investing
on are not seeing returns.
That's where the focus needs to
be, but I would say that this,
this is our job. We've, we've
been mandated to do this and we
don't need a law to tell us.
To do our job and to pass laws
that would make a difference. I
recognize your heart for
children, and I recognize your
message here and for that, I do
appreciate this.
Um, and, and we'll stand beside
you, maybe not do this, but in
whatever we have to do to
provide a future um for, for our
most vulnerable and for our next
generation of New Mexicans.
Thank you, ma'am.
OK, I guess for a second time
briefly
to table.
OK.
Yeah man, that's a non-debatable
motion. Let's go ahead and do a
roll call.
Senator Bergman's.
Senator Block.
Senator Brantley.
Senator Gallegos.
Senator Lopez, Senator Lopez is
excused. Senator Stefaniks,
Senator Stefaniks's excused.
Senator Stewart.
Senator Townsend.
Senator Harraon, Senator Harraon
is excused. Senator Bergmans.
Senator Doig. No with 6 in
favor, that bill is tabled.
Senator, thank you for, I know
you, your commitments to the
children of New Mexico. Thank
you for having this discussion.
Thank you. I appreciate very
much the discussion, you know,
this continues to kind of be my
guiding light until all, every
kid has food and, and shelter
and others, and we've got a long
way to go in many areas, we are
making progress. Thank you.
Thank you and members, I just
want to let you know we're
probably gonna stay a little
late to make sure we get through
our agenda. I had committed to
Senator Block, that he would
have 30 minutes for his next
bill, and I want to keep that
commitment, um, but then we will
still have one more to get
through after that, so just a
heads up that and all, all that
are uh
Whip no and I said you know like
they'll let your folks know to,
to excuse us from Florida. Go
ahead, Sen block.
Thank you, Madam Chair, I
appreciate uh the time uh to
hear this bill. Uh, Madam Chair,
I have two witnesses I'd like to
present on my left is Mr. Paul
Gessing from the Rio Grande
Foundation, who I think many
are, are very familiar with.
On the right, um, is Doctor, uh,
Jacob uh Curian. He's a um PhD
physicist, uh taught at UCLA.
Uh, he also taught, uh, he was
at the Institute for Advanced
Study at Princeton with Doctor
Robert Oppenheimer, who has a,
uh, history with our country as
well.
Um, one of the things that um uh
the doctors also done, he's a
published in the Journal of
Forensic and Investigative
accounting. He wrote an article
called The Anatomy of uh
Medicaid fraud, which has been
published and I can throw that
in the record uh after uh uh if
you so accept.
Um, with that, Madam Chair, and
the bill, um,
This, this is not the state
officers, auditor's office.
There's no overlap with the
auditor's duties, um, this
particular office would have
distinct powers and duties in
which serve as a support agency
to the legislator legislature to
help uh the people in New Mexico
insure their tax dollars are
being spent in accordance with
legislatively enacted budgets.
This particular office would
have a variety of expertise in
the office, uh, not necessarily
a large.
at all, uh, it would be focused
on AI coding, software
engineering procurement, uh,
data analyst, and um possibly
finance. The office would use uh
technology tools and emerging
technologies uh that can date a
mind.
Uh, millions of transactions to
identify uh potential fraud,
waste and abuse, and it can also
flag those transactions.
And they can flag those, uh,
take a look at those and analyze
those and turn them over to the
proper agency.
Uh, this agency would help the
state of New Mexico identify
issues within agencies that are
preventing the agency from
achieving its mission in the
most cost-effective way
possible. Uh, this agency would
also help the legislature to
understand if there is uh simply
wasteful spending in government,
or if it's something more
systemic.
This bill is not designed to um
uh fire uh or recommend the
removal, um, of state employees
at their jobs at all.
It is not recommended to attack
state funded programs authorized
by the legislature as well, uh,
in, um, I know there's a lot of
emotions around this issue, but
the reality is the the country
and the state actually the
country's been doing this for a
long time.
In the 1990s, President Clinton
did this exact same thing.
Uh, President Clinton's
responsible for cuts, many cuts
to the federal government back
in the 90s, working with the
Republican uh majority Congress,
and that was the last time the
federal budget was actually
balanced in 1997. So, uh, with
that, I'd just like to turn over
for a minute or two to each of
my witnesses first to, uh, Mr.
Paul Guessing.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee, uh, I am Paul
Guessing, uh, president of the
Rio Grande Foundation.
Uh, I am pleased to speak about
the government accountability to
taxpayer office contained in SB
484.
Uh, Rio Grande Foundation has
long been a fiscal watchdog for
New Mexico, albeit as an outside
organization, working to keep
New Mexico's state and local
government accountable. Over the
years, we published two what we
call piglet books, uh, a group
called Citizens Against
Government Waste produces pig
books in Washington DC, uh, we
had piglet books at the state
level. One of those was in 2008.
Another was in 2011. Those
details.
wasteful spending. We also speak
regularly about government
spending and the need to
constrain it with massive budget
surpluses and spending growth,
it is hard to build political
support for spending restraint
and efforts to target waste and
abuse. It's also hard but
critical to make sure spending
is being done effectively. That
doesn't mean we should sit back
and let waste and abuse take
place, none other than the
legislative Finance Committee
agrees with us, as the fiscal
impact report for this bill
notes.
LFC has recommended that the
state consider creating a
standalone office of Inspector
General Le Gatto, uh, the
acronym GATO, that would audit
and investigate executive branch
agencies or strengthen.
Statutory guard rails around
Inspector General and audit
internal audit functions within
state agencies.
Currently 11 states have a
stand-alone Office of Inspector
General, with statewide
authority in 26 states with one
or more agency levels, level
OIGs with 5 states having both
types. New Mexico has a few
agency level OIGs.
Whether it is outright fraud
like that perpetrated by then
rep Cheryl Williams Stapleton,
or simply the fact that New
Mexico has $6 billion in unspent
capital outlay money, yet the
worst roads in America,
according to a recent report.
New Mexico has a lot of money
sloshing around in various funds
and pots. Where's the money? Is
it being managed and invested
effectively, if possible, is
anything untoward happening that
could be detected through
improved oversight.
Just because the state has a lot
of cash doesn't mean we don't
need better oversight. In fact,
having lots of money is even
more important reason for
improved oversight.
The bank robber Willie Sutton
said way back in the 1930s that
when he was asked why he robbed
banks, he responded, because
that's where the money is. New
Mexico can and should be a do a
better job with financial
oversight. Don't ask me or Elon
Musk, asked the LFC.
And, uh, doc.
Good morning.
Um
I've been in New Mexico for
about 30 years now. I was a
professor at UCLA.
Uh, in physics, and I've been
working in healthcare.
And one of the really um serious
issues will be facing if we're
not already is the fact that
Medicaid is going to be running
out of money at some point.
And the numbers of people who
are qualified for to receive
benefits in Medicare are going
to increase as you see more of
these government servants losing
their position.
So what we have is a situation
where we're running short of
money, and then we have the new
budget, the current budget that
has been proposed that talks
about $880 billion of reduction
in Medicaid in the next decade.
And that's going to be very,
very tragic because we have
almost half of
Half the population in New
Mexico are enrolled in Medicaid.
So we're really talking about
our neighbors, our friends, and
so on, and it is time for us to
think ahead and do something.
And
And uh when I talked to Center
Block.
I thought that a very good uh
first attempt for it.
Group that he calls Kato.
could be actually trying to
eliminate some of the fraud and
abuse that exists right now.
In Medicaid and collect the
money back so that we can use it
for the purposes.
So I'm referring to uh an LFC
report.
That came out in 2019.
Um, which said that $660 million
of overpayments with collected
back from the.
Medicaid insurance.
And what was really missing
there was the fact that because
they're overpayments.
And they were collected more
than 60 days after the end of
the period.
Statutes say that they have to
pay a 300%.
Penalty.
But that was never collected. So
we're really talking about $2
billion that is still owed to
the taxpayers in Mexico.
And a local problem is a
national problem. There's over
$100 billion similarly floating
around that really belongs to
taxpayers, that we need some
organization to take charge of
it and collect it, and I thought
this was an excellent
opportunity. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Uh, we'll stand for
questions.
Thank you, Senator. So, uh, you
have a 5.5 minutes left of your
time, as you know, the 15
minutes per presentation
includes public comment and
support. We have 9 people signed
up as organized support. We're
not gonna be able to do that in
5 minutes. So I will give one
minute to each person. We'll get
through who we can. Uh, so we
have, and folks go ahead and
line up as I call your name,
Ramona Goolsby, John Veltry Beth
Dowling.
Cynthia Luhong Canner, uh, Nancy
Siabaka Jinks and that's all
we're only gonna have time to go
through 5, you can proceed for
up to 1 minute. Go ahead.
Accountability
of SB 484.
I stand in strong support of SB
484, Madam Chair, the vice
chair, and another member of
this committee understands how
important it is to hold
government accountable.
It should not be up to members
of the public such as myself to
audit reports and file
complaints for violating laws,
but.
That is exactly what has been
occurring because you do not
police yourselves. Is that why
this bill was not brought
forward sooner. My work has
become more challenging because
this very body continues to pass
laws to hide more and more
public records each session.
So SB 484 could help
tremendously by shining light on
waste, inefficiency and by
reviewing each agency for
compliance. Thank you.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
senators John Beltre Better
Together, New Mexico State
leader the government
accountability to taxpayers Act
will clearly recommend
legislation to the legislators
for increasing the efficiency
and the accountability of
government operations in New
Mexico, which I personally see
only good and positive things
can come out of this with the
proposed executive branch office
being created, it will conduct
audits of the state agencies and
programs and recommend
improvements in government
operations to increase.
sufficiency and simply reduce
waste. In addition, this office
will provide an annual report,
something that has never been
done in the past, which shall
include an analysis of the
state's fiscal health and
administrative efficiencies
which shall detail the office's
activities and findings and will
make recommendations for
improvement, better together in
New Mexico through today has
already submitted 62,270 emails
supporting SB 484. This is the
Thank you,
sir and I hope you will as well.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Beth Dowling, and I am
the chair of the Republican
Party for Sandoval County. In
April of 2024 during the Biden
administration, the nonpartisan
United States Government
Accountability Office estimated
the federal government could
lose as much as between 200 and
$500 billion annually to fraud.
But here in New Mexico, we have
no idea what that level of waste
and fraud is.
We cannot afford to do nothing,
as Senator Stewart just said, we
all need to work together. And
uh, we wanna know why there is
a.
Discord with the two parties not
working together on
accountability.
The real threat to democracy is
unaccountable bureaucracy due to
lack of accountability and
oversight. I strongly urge you
to support Senate Bill 484.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
committee members. My name is
Cynthia Kenner. This bill allows
6 full-time employees and
independent department with the
primary focus and objectives to
audit multiple agency with the
capital outlay that totaled over
10 billion in New Mexico. They
would have access to records
with subpoena power and a budget
of 1.5 million, it's very
nominal compared to that. It's
about 0.
015% at most to ensure extra
eyes with the fiscal reports on
the website to being more
transparency for the people. It
can deter God and embezzlement.
Legislator and the people can
use this as a tool to evaluate
and make proposed improvement in
an area that may be rebuilt and
reduced tax waste of taxpayers'
money, all records of the people
that belong to the people. These
are public records. I believe
this is good.
and common sense to bring
accountability.
Thank you, ma'am.
Madam Chair, good morning. Good
morning, Senators. My name is
Nancy Cabaka Jinks. I'm a
retired state employee with full
benefits of 25 years plus, and I
want to thank each of you on
this committee for paying for my
salary these past years and also
now for my retirement. I'm now
asking that uh I, when I gave to
you that you give to me in
return, which is asking for the
same acuity, quality, devotion
that I gave to you for the
investment in me. I had the
opportunity to take advantage of
adding to my retirement VRR
state government letter which is
promotion, promotion, promotion.
Frequently a tradeoff would be
requiring travel for these
promotions to another city,
beginning my career in DPS to
carry.
Later, working in Albuquerque,
Santa Fe, Los Lunas, and finally
retiring in an office in
Albuquerque. I utilize the
promotion. Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am. That's time.
All right, um, we did, did not
have to, we didn't have anyone
sign up in position, right? All
right, members of the committee,
Senator Townsend. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Thank you, Senator,
experts.
Um
I have long been a proponent of,
of
Trying to
uh
and validate our budget.
I, uh
I, I do believe that we can do
this more than.
One way, your way is certainly a
great way.
To address it. The other way
would be to take
Annually, one department at a
time and really do what is
called a zero-based budget where
you just tear it down.
Figure out what the goals and
objectives are of of that
department fun the um set
post that economic
projects where you look, a year
down the road, 2 years down the
road, but see what regulations
have things how the economy
moved, whatever it is, and then
readjust and keep going forward.
The other way is to do it in the
manner that you're talking about
with the oversight group. Both
of them would work great.
I've long been a proponent that
New Mexico really doesn't have
what I call a budget. We
basically spend what we bring
in, and that is what we call a
budget when we, we look at our
income stream and we spend that
much.
We haven't addressed.
Uh, that, yeah, but we will at
some point in time, and it
constantly is causes a little
problem with bond ratings.
We really need to have a budget
that
is one that these legislators
Have more input into and
department secretaries, quite
frankly, have more
accountability for, so for that
reason, I support your effort,
um, and I believe that
accountability regardless of
political affiliation, but
regardless of whose in the
governor's, if we all just in
the legislative
Body.
that
Trying to make our government
more efficient and more
productive at the same time, not
just cuts, but more productive,
using the money more wisely is a
good move, so I appreciate your
bill and I look forward to
supporting it.
Thank you, Senator, before I go
to the next speaker.
I just want to know, uh, the
state auditor is in the
audience. I, he didn't have a an
opportunity to, to sign up, uh,
but I believe he is here in
opposition. Um, and I, I
neglected on the last bill. I
said,
Whoever is here in the audience
who wanted to raise their hand
in the case of court, please do
so, go ahead, y'all, if you
want, if you want to raise your
hand to indicate support.
And those who would like to
raise their hands to indicate
opposition, please do so.
OK. Thank you. I apologize for,
for skipping that step before,
Senator Stewart.
Thank you, madam chair. Sing a
little whiplash today, you know,
one of our senators thinks we're
not doing enough, and has laid
it out for us in detail where we
need to spend more in all these
areas, and now we have a senator
saying, no, no, let's rein it in
and let's get people out here
cracking the whip and finding
that frightened abuse, so.
Well,
uh, so, uh,
I think that we already have
plenty of oversight. LFC is
amazing, and they write these
reports regularly. Uh we don't
always agree with them, but
that's OK. Um, I'm involved in
all kinds of audit reports that
I have to go through, sit
through, uh, fix if we don't do
things every year, um, at the
end of this session, there'll be
an audit report, but we require
audits.
Now, have we found all fraud and
abuse, I'm sure we haven't, um,
but do we look at these on a
regular basis? Yes, we do. Um.
But I just
10 o'clock. I'm just surprised
that you would think.
That we would want a Doge cut
off this here, and what's
happening, I know this is
patterned after that. What's
happening with the federal
government.
I mean, they're about to close
down the
Department of Education, they
fired 1300 employees and
education has 30% of our budget
in New Mexico comes from the
federal government. That's about
to end, including 30%, about 30%
is for students that are having
difficulty at Title 12345, etc.
for teacher training for more
help for kids that are
struggling. Uh, so, um, I don't
I would never do a Doge type
thing that's going on at the
federal government. I know
you're trying to back away from
that, saying, well, they're not
gonna be able to fire people.
Um, but the, the, the, the
aspiration behind it and what
you're trying to do to me is
anathema to how we have to work
now. um I'm we're going to have
to, we're gonna have to use our
reserves. We're going to have to
use these trust funds that we
put money in, but
When we get the cuts from the
federal government. Medicaid.
If they cut Medicaid, we will
have to use our reserves because
we have to have healthcare for
our population. Uh, so I just uh
Just can't, can't abide by this
at all today. Thank you, madam
chair.
Thank you, Senators.
Thank you, Madam Chair and good
morning, Senator Black.
Um, I believe uh that this
actually duplicates a lot of
what we do in state government
in a different way than Senator
Stewart was talking about. We
have our state auditor, we have
our state treasurer. We have the
attorney general who's now in
Department of Justice, but in
the Attorney General's office,
we have some fraud, we have a
fraud unit because I was very
familiar with working with that,
um, through Medicaid.
And Medicare, uh, they handle as
well, but every department has
an inspector general.
Who has authority to initiate
lawsuits to go after um
employees, for example, if
they're falsely using SNAP
benefits of another person, etc.
etc.
So I, at this time,
And besides everything that LFC
does, uh, LFC and DFA make every
department go through the
wringer.
With performance measures.
And then they do.
do checks and balances on
budgets because of that.
So, at this time,
I think it's a little
duplicative.
I do understand that we want to
be.
Um
slim and trim
and that we want to save money
and that we want to get rid of
problems.
And I think
Many people in state government
to stand up to take the top
jobs.
They believe that.
And, you know, for every person
who's the secretary of the
department.
It's not a 5 day a week job.
It's 24/7.
And I know you have been in
positions like that, and I truly
appreciate it, but some of the
people, Madame Chair leading our
departments don't get a break.
They don't get a rest.
And so for some of those
reasons, I won't be able to
support it, but thank you very
much for bringing it forward.
Thank you, Senator Bentley.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator, for bringing this
forward. I think
We have a responsibility as
elected officials to be
accountable to the taxpayers
that we
collect their hard-earned money
from. I, I do thank you for
bringing this forward and I will
say this, I think that all
levels of government from the
federal government all the way
down to our local counties and
municipalities have a
responsibility to be good
stewards and fiscally uh
Uh, conservative, we have an
accountability, we must be
accountability accountable to
the, the people that we serve.
Um
I, I will say this, I, I realize
that you're coming here and this
is a message, this bill doesn't
have time to travel forward like
I would like it to, but I would
say this, I hope this is a
message to the government
employees that are here in the
room who are AG to our treasure,
to our auditors.
That
That we are demanding more
accountability from them, I
hope, and even our secretaries
have a responsibility and to be
a little bit defensive of
legislators.
We often don't know what we
don't know.
I, I remember uh post COVID, my
first interim, I was in an LFC
meeting and very much in passing
in a presentation, the workforce
solutions secretary at the time,
mentioned the enormous amount of
Unemployment, overpayment
benefits and then kind of
skirted on and legislators
there, I mean, their minds are
the first they'd ever heard of
it at this one particular
meeting. I think it was one
example of many in which this
body doesn't even know what,
what we don't know, the
information that's not provided
to us. Um, I'd, I'd like to ask
you.
In addition to that example,
what do you envision, what do
you envision and what is your
goal in, in passing this
legislation where they would
identify information and how
would that channel back to get
that information back to
legislators.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, Senator for the
question.
Well, what you're talking about
it, it was in the news recently
where the state overpaid uh New
Mexicans $250 million.
And the question is, like you
said, what is out there that we
don't know?
And when it comes to, you know,
uh, the federal doge compared to
the state again this, this is
not the same thing, uh, call it
the same thing, don't call it
the same thing. It doesn't
matter to me. I only care about
right now New Mexico and making
sure that we're good stewards of
our money. In regards to the um
state auditor who have had a
couple of quick um uh emails
back to you, even the state
auditor has said that he needs
more funding to be an effective
financial watchdog, holding
public.
including state agencies and
their programs accountable. So
we're not doing enough. In
regards to these other entities
that do that, they have
different rules and
responsibilities and roles. This
is a continued level of effort
across the spectrum of state
government.
Consistently looking at
processes and procedures and
ensuring the money is spent
appropriately as legislators
have voted in the budget. Now
the budget we know is large.
It's over $10 billion. It's
increased 75% over the past 6
years.
If we're seeing a lot of fraud.
I mean, we've seen it with
legislators with unfortunately,
one who was a teacher who's
going through some uh serious
legal issues right now. There's
a lot more that we can find here
that is wasteful spending.
Again, this is, these are state
employees of state office, and I
even wanted to put this under
the governor.
Uh, because I think it should be
under the governor. I mean we
can argue if it's, if that's
right or not.
But all we're asking for is a
consistent continual continual
level of effort across state
government looking for this. And
if something is flagged in the
transaction using the emerging
techno emerging technologies and
technologies we currently have
in a very small office of say 5
to 6 people.
That's $250 million on just that
one instance, and there are many
more out there and all of us
know of all the corruption that
we've seen or all the wasteful
spending that we've seen across
state government.
Again, this is not targeted at
jobs in regards to the
Department of Education, that's
a federal program, you're still
going to get grants and Pell
grants and all that stuff.
This office would not have
subpoena power, it would also
not have the power to fire
employees. It's a transparency
office that flags transactions.
I mean, even, even one of the
senators said we know there's
fraud out there ways.
OK.
Then why not do something about
it and have the right level of
effort focusing on that day to
day for every New Mexican.
That's all this is about. It's a
real simple process, and
unfortunately, when you talk
about inspector generals in all
these different departments,
they don't do this. They go out,
they're waiting for information
to come in because someone, a
whistleblower will go to them
anonymously and I'm very
familiar with this in my
background saying, hey.
I saw so and so.
Forging or, you know, taking
SNAP benefits or something like
that that doesn't belong to him
or her. Those are small issues,
but there's still fraud. We
should still focus on that and
take care of that. So they're
not doing it 100%. They're doing
investigations when something is
brought up.
This is continually looking and
and those other agencies aren't
using the tools that we have
today. They're just not doing
that.
And that's inefficient. So when
I talk about efficiencies, I'm
also talking about the tools
that can go in and do the data
mining of these organizations
with speed that we don't have
now in efficiencies that we
don't have now to go do that.
And, uh, uh, with that, do you
have anything? Are you good?
And Senator, I'll just say
we're, we're getting short on
time here.
OK. And with that, um, Madam
Chair, I, I yield.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair and
Senator, I would say that I
think that we
New Mexicans, especially
taxpayers, deserve some
accountability of where their
money is being spent. I also
think that a program like that
would make us better lawmakers
and a stronger legislator. Um, I
think that we need not only our
secretaries, auditors, our
agencies need to be able to
identify waste and abuse, but I
also think that we need to be
making the investment in
programs like LFC or similar
that identify the agencies and
the programs that are also
failing to meet performance
metrics. So thank you very much
for,
your effort in bringing this
forward.
So I'll note that we we we've
exceeded the time that that we
had had agreed upon, uh,
So
But go ahead, uh, let's, let's
everyone stay concise
sour center, uh, being on the
scoreboard, we have a audits,
uh, for our county. Can you tell
me the difference between uh
maybe what the performance audit
is. So we use our audits to flag
issues that we need to correct
in our budget.
But I'm wondering what your
performance audit would do,
thinking back through you
brought up the school teacher
that had an issue earlier, um,
I'm wondering if you're
performance of it would have
gotten to the
the problem with that insurance
center.
Thank, thank you very much.
Thank you, Senator. Real quick,
uh, yes, because what this,
what, what you could also
envision this office is, and
everyone has talked about it, we
have, uh, you know, this IG in
this area in this department,
this auditor here, this office
could actually be the
integrator.
Because right now we're
fractured across state
government and and having an
integrated office doing that, I
think it would have caught what
happened before, um, things
really went um.
It was bad. It was very, very
bad, but this integrated office.
Uh, could, could, is another
efficiency that would do that
across the state and with that,
Madam Chair, I'm going to yield
because of the time.
Thank you.
Thank you. I don't have anyone
else on the list. Um,
I'll say a couple things, and
then I, I'd like to ask our, our
auditor question. Yes, yes, uh.
So the the situation.
that we've been discussed that
you were just asked about what
that had caught that. Those
weren't state funds, those are
federal funds. Um, so I suspect.
This had this been in place, it
would have had no impact on on
that situation whatsoever. Um,
He also said that there's no
subpoena power in this office.
There is absolutely subpoena
power in this office.
On page.
4.
Um
So
But I would like to hear from
our state auditor.
How
How
What is being proposed here
would be, would be any different
from, from the job that you do
already. Thank you, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, uh,
it's a pleasure to be here. Um,
I sat here and listened to the
entire presentation of the bill,
and I want to commend Senator
Block for his concern in
stamping out fraud, waste, and
abuse, but I respectfully say
that this piece of legislation
is, is quite duplicative with
the function of my office. My
office is a constitutionally
enabled office charge.
with auditing every single
public entity in the state of
New Mexico.
I'm talking almost 1200
entities, about 650 are subject
to a full financial audit, and
that audit oversight includes.
Uh, the auditing of state
agencies, including programs
including.
Federal funds.
We also have a function to um
process the anonymous intake of
fraud, waste, and abuse
complaints. I have a cadre of
certified fraud examiners that
investigate these complaints of
fraud, waste, and abuse.
Right now, business is, uh, you
know, uh flourishing. We have
over about 300 active cases of
fraud, waste and abuse. Uh, now
these cases typically write for
referral. We typically refer it
to the prosecuting authority in
that locale if it requires
additional investigation, we can
make a referral either to the
Attorney General or to the state
police or to the local police
department, but I do want to
remind the committee that we
have a new entity that's.
involved in investigating Broad
waste and abuse complaints,
particularly as they pertain to
the governmental Conduct Act,
and that's our state ethics
commission.
So we make referrals to the
state ethics commission, we've
made almost maybe about 15 uh of
officials, uh, or elected
officials that have violated the
Governmental Conduct Act. Now,
my office does have subpoena
authority, um, and so,
What I'm hearing is basically
duplicating almost every single
function of this office, as you
know, certain state agencies
that are considered high risk
already have inspectors general
embedded in those agencies, my
office is advocating for more
IGs in some of these state
agencies, uh, I agree with the
LFC report.
That in many instances, these
IGs are selected by the Cabinet
secretary and should be very
independent. I'd like to see
inspectors general
administratively attached to my
office. My office is also
advocated for the creation of a
statewide inspector general.
There's about 13 or so states
that have a statewide inspector
General that's independent. And
I want, I want to state that
independence is critical in this
entire discussion. And so, uh,
I'm happy to meet with the
senator.
Uh, I presented a memorial
calling on the study to create a
statewide inspector general. So
my, my door is open. Uh, I want
to conclude by saying that my
office does need additional
funding. We have key mission
critical vacancies that are held
open for budgetary reasons, and
uh I hope to continue this
dialogue and, and inform folks
about my obscure office,
apparently it's so obscure that
somebody wants to create an
office that duplicates.
That particular office, but I'm
asking for your support to
continue to fully fund my office
and help me reform the industry,
help me establish a pipeline of
accounting majors, uh, so we
have many issues that I'd love
to discuss with you, but, uh, I,
I, I believe this separatist
misguided. Thank you for the
opportunity, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Mr. Roger. Senator
Bergmans.
Madam chair moved the table.
It's a non-debatable motion, is
called the.
Senator Bergman's.
Senator Block.
I.
The table your own bill? Well, I
mean, Madam Chair, we're so far
now it's, we're gonna, we're,
I'm gonna bring this back, so
it's.
Senator Brantley noted table.
Senator Gallegos.
Senator Lopez, Senator Lopez is
excused. Senator Stefaniks.
Senator Stewart.
Senator Townsend, Senator
Jaramil.
Senator Doig.
He asked with 6 in favor, your
bill is tabled. Thank you,
Senator.
Thank you, madam.
All right. Representative
Little, come on up.
Representing a little, we need
to do this in, in less than 10
minutes. So I'll ask you to be,
be very brief and I'll ask our
members to be very brief as
well.
Thank you, Madam Chair, I will
move right into this. In keeping
with the discussion earlier this
morning that I was able to hear
uh the uh efforts to make sure
that our
children and their elders keep
their bellies full. The bill I'm
bringing in front of you today
is House Bill 17. It establishes
a commission on the reduction of
grocery costs, this bill will,
um, address the rising cost of
groceries in New Mexico by
creating a commission to
identify and study the cases,
the causes of grocery inflation.
Uh, the committee will the
commission will study this
system, the entire system from
our farmers and dairy producers
and meat producers as well, all
the way through the system till
it gets into our hands, the
consumer's hands, uh, a quick
example, I was standing in line
at a neighborhood grocery store.
Uh, I left checked out.
Did self checkout thinking maybe
I'd get a little bit of a break
in prices as we all know, not
happening. So I stood there
examining my receipt that had
come up to for 2 bags and a
little bottle of of uh clothes
detergent was $78. And I just, I
thought, did I scan 23 times
maybe while I was standing there
looking at this. There were
elders behind me who we started
the conversation and they were
expressing just how hard it was
to make ends meet.
On a fixed income. I thought we
were talking about their
children and their grandchildren
who are growing and trying to
fill their bellies as well on on
such high grocery costs. So,
The commission is going to, uh,
will be a 9 member commission,
uh, and as you've seen the bill,
it will be a diverse group, uh,
looking to, uh, ultimately
provide a report at the end of
November, so this is an
actionable, uh, uh.
Effort, um, taking a look at the
entire system to recommend
methods to support our local
food producers, farmers,
ranchers and food businesses,
and improve access to locally
grown and affordable options in
New Mexico. Also taking a look
and assessing where
infrastructure like
transportation, coal storage and
distribution systems could
reduce costs and make our
systems stronger. Um, they're
also gonna be taking a look at
the
uh, the current state laws to
ensure that everyone is
protected in this effort as
well.
Uh, well, there's a, a focus
going to be specifically on
essential food products, they're
also going to take a look at
that again, as I've mentioned
earlier, I'll try to make this
brief, but um, taking a look at
the entire entire food system. I
heard mentioned just a few
minutes ago too that um there
are a lot of efforts that are
taking place to
To help our families, to assist
our families and children in New
Mexico. The economic development
department, it has it will house
this in their their department,
as we know, some of us may be
very familiar with the food
hunger and agricultural program,
um, where the mission is to uh
try to move this forward as
well, these efforts forward. The
Department of Agriculture, I
talked with the deputy and they
are looking forward to this
because they.
are also working to stand up the
um uh meat inspection programs
in the state of New Mexico with
the idea that not just keeping
our meats here and producing
them, uh, processing them here
in New Mexico would also
alleviate some of the costs that
are now being added to the
prices of meat products because
they're all
Uh, produced outside. We ship
them out and they um they
produce their um processed
outside of the state and then
brought back in with additional
prices, so this is a
multi-pronged effort with a lot
of departments, they'll be ex
subject matter experts that will
have been identified in the bill
and this commission will also
take a look at inviting others,
as we've heard during the
debates on the House side of
getting subject matters experts
in.
like those in the uh retail
grocery um industry as well as
um risk management as well, so.
With that, I, I have, um, my
co-sponsor, Senator Bergman's
here.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you. We did not have anyone sign
up and uh support or opposition.
Would anyone like to raise their
hand to indicate support?
But I wouldn't like to and raise
their hand to indicate
opposition.
All right, Senator Branley.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative. I'm glad you're
here. I am an agricultural
economics major from New Mexico
State University, and within New
Mexico State University's
College of Agriculture and
Consumer Science. The entire
divisions that research and
provide these and this annual
information all the time. That's
what they do, and that is within
obviously state government, New
Mexico State University.
What do you, what are you
looking to find by creating this
commission that our experts and,
and economics and agriculture at
New Mexico State University
couldn't readily provide for us
today.
Thank you, Madam Chair, Senator.
They would contribute that
knowledge, that expertise to an
entire group, um, that will be
comprised of the others in the,
on the commission.
Because that is valuable
information.
Thank you. And Madam Chair
Representative to contribute
that information to what end?
What, what information are you
looking to find that our, our
agricultural economists don't
already work on every single
day.
Go through New Mexico University
and the New Mexico Department of
Ag, which is in housed within
NMSU.
The they input would be
contributed to a final product
at the end, and what we're
looking at to come out from uh
to come out from this is a
report that lets us know where
the rest of the shortcomings may
be or areas that we need to
emphasize, uh, uh, in this
system and uh so that
Looking at it with the timeline
of November, the commission
would recommend either
actionable items for us to take
a look at because there are
different mini facets to this
and make recommendations for the
next.
To, I would say 2 sessions or
Uh, directly, uh, make
recommendations as to things
that can be done currently
within the systems that exist.
And Madam Chair, Senator, if I
could just add the report that's
due by March 30th of November,
uh, specifically outlines that
provide recommendations and
proposed legislation. So I think
the idea would be with that
great resource just breaking
down some of the silos and
actually bringing that knowledge
to us and to everyone else
involved.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative Senator, I think
you would be probably pleasantly
surprised. I hope to find out
that this is very duplicative of
what these professors do every
single day. There are some
really detailed reports that um
that take a snapshot, not just
of current market trends, but
where we're headed, why we're
there, that are accessible to
legislators and frankly all New
Mexicans right now that would,
would identify and meet really
every single um uh outlier that
you had said that you would like
to see. So I really encourage
you in the meantime to reach
out.
to Mexico State University and
New Mexico Department of Ag.
They are resources that they
are, we, we invest a lot into
those departments to provide you
the information that you are
exactly trying to create a a
commission to to uh to provide.
It's readily available today. So
thank you.
have to be 2 more people on the
list, Senators, we need to be on
the floor in 5 minutes, so
please be very, very brief. I'll
be very brief. Um, thank you,
Madam Chair. Thank you, uh, for
bringing this forward. I think
this can be done, not just with
New Mexico State University, but
the the Food and Hunger Network.
Uh, they are through the
Department of Ag, but they
permeate every state agency.
There are several advocacy
groups, all the food depots are
involved, the um
You know, so I think that
there's an existing entity. I
don't know if your funding was
cut or if it was included in
House Bill 2, but uh depending
upon how this goes, I think we
can hook you up with the people
to maybe accomplish this. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator.
Ament centers as set my
granddaughter a note the other
day, and it's just changing
times, I think this during
theiden administration,
everything skyrocketed on
prices, but uh it said find eggs
on the street and wheat in the
stores shows times have changed.
But I was wondering on your,
your point.
Why are we not looking in the
Mexico grocer Association. Just
ask them, can you highlight the
increases.
And why you look, just think
about eggs.
Uh, during COVID.
There's a lot of, I do
construction and my guys in my
office can tell me the cost
increases PVC steel, all the
materials we use, they can't
give me a reason why, because
it's something beyond their
scope, but the New Mexico
Grocery Association.
would have that detail because
they have to track it, they're
in the business of
Selling groceries. I noticed
when turned Senator and
Representative in your uh bill
page 2 to Senator for starting
on page 2. We, we, we need to be
out of here in about 3 minutes,
uh, I see item A. I would have
strucked that whole item and put
in grocery store management.
Or a lobbyist because I don't
see what that
sector does for us that 5% of
the state, you're asking 5% of
the state to be on a board.
That has no knowledge.
Like the grocery Association
has, and that's just a
suggestion. I know it'll pass
out of here. I can do the math.
on school board, but I don't see
the value of this as we go
forward in there so late in the
session, sort of like certain
block, it's sort of like uh it
ends tomorrow at noon, and I can
do that, but sure, I will yield,
said her harm me. Madare would
do pass. All right, we have a
motion for to pass. Let's do a
roll call vote.
Senator Bergman's.
Senator Block.
Senator Brantley.
Senator Gallegos.
No, ma'am.
Senator Lopez, Senator Lopez is
excused. Senator Stefaniks.
Senator Stewart, yes.
Senator Townsend.
Senator Jaramil.
Senator Duha with 5 in favor,
you have to pass. Members just
real quickly before you run out
of here. One, I just really
wanna thank uh all of our
members for all of your work,
uh, this session, and I
especially want to thank all of
our staff and everyone who has
supported us here.
Um, and also, uh, keep an eye on
your email. You're gonna get a
doodle pole about interim
scheduling, and so we will be
seeing you all during the
interim to, to do some
confirmation,
