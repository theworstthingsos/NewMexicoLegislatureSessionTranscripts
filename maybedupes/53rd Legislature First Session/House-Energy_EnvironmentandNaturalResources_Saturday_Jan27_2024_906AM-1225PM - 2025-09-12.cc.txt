Madam bice chair saturday anna.
And mr chairman here
we have a chorum
okay
as usual before we could serve a
couple hours keeping matters
first off we were here for
maybe seven hours last thirty
in we had lunch brought in
thanks to western resource
advocates we appreciate I have
not asked for lunch today i.
Foresee these bills taking that
long is certainly.
Okay so that's that's a good
point I read some month so each
bill we will do no more than
fifteen minutes prone kind
ninety seconds a person like yes
as we don't get to fifteen
minutes but that's.
So I mean I I think a lot of us
also have afternoon committee.
And i'd like you know for people
to be able to tick break between
committees
second item
I know there's a lot of texting
the goes on during the committee
meetings and i'm fine with that
I would ask that you turn off
the little time
that sounds every time you get a
text
and maybe it's my good year but
I i'm looking at represents
guide
resident.
So
so
like so
or something towns and III know
it's that I actually don't mind
the change as much as I am
distracted by the side
conversations so the fact that
we are interested by party I
still think that's a better
approach.
Okay so I I may be the one
ranger but that's the way it is
in you know like you know I get
texts I can see him on my screen
I need to hear a lot of time so
that that's just my request.
Um mr chairman.
Miss mister chair and if
representative scott were
representative towns and need to
help with that I have my sixteen
year old daughter is in town
okay
that they could be used for.
The last thing I want to go very
was the our last regular meeting
thursday I guess it was tracker
days hospital one thirty three.
So that was a long meeting
and
there was
a I would like to apologise to
our vice chair reps in sarniana
she had three amendments for
that bill
the amendments were circulated
in advance I think members of
the public word where them and
we're sort of waiting for them
there was an communication
between the two of us.
I recognized that sergeant to
speak.
She spoke briefly and said she
was done I took that to me and
she wasn't going to offer the
amendments she expected me to
come back to her to
offer the amendments after we
are done discussing the bill so
that was a miscommunication of
apologise to the voice chair I
want to mention that publicly
and unfortunately we'll all
people watch in that meeting
they're probably not watching
right now
for people who were expecting to
hear those amendments in that
discussion.
That's why they weren't offered.
Cause it was a miscommunication
so I just want they're going to
be aware that that happened
yeah and it was a long meeting
but it's unfortunate that.
Represent grecia mister chair on
that point.
You know it might be.
Beneficial to the committee
as a whole
if you cannot leave some round
rules in terms of processing
substantial bill.
In terms of.
What can happen.
In that process
in terms of a weekend I entered.
The.
Are with an open enough or
debate discussion input from the
audience.
And also the role that
amendments have in the sun cause
some people believe or feel that
mister chair that that a sub
cannot be amended but it can be
amended the thing is that the
serve has to go back to council
and in that sub with the new
amendments and then has to come
back to the committee.
For approval.
So I think that's that would be
prudent mister chair because
there are new members in the
committee but even some of all
us all timers you can forget the
process
and kind of need need that the
that
understanding of what what is
entailed in in processing the
substitute to
thank for their representative
occurs here I think that's an
inaccurate statement so in that
bill we were on a committee set
in.
It's the the standard practice
this is I learn this from jewish
airy
like we will not have house
energy committee amendments to a
house and g committees up.
Yeah so if any of the amendments
had been adopted.
We would have sent that back to
a legislative council to do a
new site the other thing that
was tricky about the serve in in
adhering to the twenty four
hour.
Is that the sub got sent out
about twenty four hours
to meet
it
I know there was interest in
offering amendments
in those amendments couldn't be
sent out you know prepared and
sent out within that same twice.
It hearing to this way for hour.
My intention had those
amendments been offered.
What was to.
Except them if they related to
something new or different in
the sub
if they simply related to the
original bill.
I I think the twenty four hour
rule should be respect.
The.
Represents her none is had she
had six amendments right so the
first three were to the original
bill and then
they were recent out with the
proper
illinitions for the subsidiary.
Since it was a substitute
I was willing to consider the
the amendments the language in
the amendments the substance of
the amendment as originally
submitted and then go the
process go back to the local
council for the process of
fixing it
but that that was sort of the
plan so I think if you have in
the men meant
that changes the original bill
are adds to the original bill
you should submit that twenty
four hours and then.
If there's something new in the
sub like if a sub comes back
with a new provision new section
that you haven't seen
a won't work with that in and do
that on the flyer whatever it
takes
because that
it would be unfair to enforce
that twenty four hour rule in
that.
Represent towns and did.
I think without regard.
If you have a.
The old.
That's dropped with the.
A few minutes or hour or so.
Yet behoods all of us to risk
back each other's ability to
respond to that in a meaningful
way because the warm will turn
some point in time and I mean
right right
and I I appreciate that because
I think.
Person of the legislature.
Rivers in towns are repres.
Mr chairman in this circumstance
there was.
Yeah.
The.
Whether or not ma.
The.
That we put or wait in the
process.
The.
That down situation
leave me to believe that unless
everything is out there in a
sufficient amount of time.
For.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah certainly
there's no intention to ambush
anyone in the the committee
served for that particular bill
it had some editions mostly it
was subtraction.
You know a lot of this is is
hard to pin down in great detail
and.
Um.
I think reaches have to ticket
his account.
Thank you mister chair I think
you appreciate your clarifying.
Looking to allow.
Changes substantive to changes
in the.
Substitute.
I appreciate that I think what
you laid out
as fair there was some concern
mrperiod chairs.
Substitute came out.
Publicly.
The.
To the substitute.
And that that kind of letter at
least me.
There were some knowledge of
this before
the substitute was available
sometime before so.
Other amendments could be.
Forwarded so I I would just ask
that
when a substitute is ready if we
know that what's in there I mean
they're because that cause any
of the amendments that were
presented soon after their head
did they have there was a amount
of time.
Mister chair that would have to
have been processed through
legislative council service so
i.
So I I would just ask when.
A.
A substitute is ready.
It is presented as soon as it's
ready and I and sometimes I
understand how drafting work
sometimes.
The.
But at some point.
If there's a draft of that
legislation before the final is
done.
And and if if that's available
the sooner we get at th.
On it for us
and.
I think that keeps us from
making mistakes I think
sometimes if we have a short
period of really short window
and then we're trying to comply
with your new rules which once
again I do appreciate your
laying that I think that's a
very far process but that would
give us the opportunity for us
to get a good product out there
everyone's a while I have had to
rush an amendment through to
respond to something and what
happens is then there's a word
in my amendment that was an
unintended it was missed and
then we're presenting and then
it's pointed out and it was
never intended but that I
missed.
I would just so maybe you.
If members before this if they
haven't.
That would be helpful I know you
don't always know that as.
Representatives
okay so just just to clarify.
The original serve amendments
was to the original bill
in then win win the
commission was distributed.
Legislative council tweaked the
amendments to make them
appropriate for the committee so
the committee served.
We sent out within the twenty
four hour rule which is.
And changes as the session goes
on but we we we hit that time.
Cause that's where we had.
And in fact that that bill had
originally been scheduled for
saturday.
And there were changes
happening.
The lead sponsor on that bill
asked me to schedule it for
tuesday.
As I knew they were still
and if you look at the community
service a point two.
Because they were changing the
changes.
You know and that's why I mean
we send it out as soon as we
have it.
But we didn't have it.
I think we've been there's a
pretty good we won't keep going
mister just one more thing
in our less committee meeting
that is all of these.
Changes that were made very late
in the process.
No no.
The.
The.
Those are information committee
the amendments.
So
I agree.
So last year reps in scott and I
could sponsored house concurrent
resolution one.
Which states there can be served
in moment should be posted on
the legislative website as soon
as practicable.
Following
when they're made available to
the committee.
Staff has interpreted that.
As as soon as practicable after
their moved in committee.
That interpretation is wrong.
And evicerate the rule that we
were turned to get past so we
could provide this public
information.
So.
Very frustrated by that issue
still working on that issue
probably won't get resolved this
session but I told he agree with
you reps got rose embergo
mr cherry appreciate that you're
you recognize that
one of the reasons I voted
against that bill was because I
felt like it was a moving target
and I just felt like if we're
going to initiate policy for at
at that magnitude when it cost
you know small businesses and
you know the community which
they came out in force.
I think that we need to be
clearer about our policy rose
how we present what we are
expectation for presenting the
policy and especially in my mind
public notification I and that
was one of the main reasons that
I voted against that because I
just I was really uncomfortable
with the way I was receiving and
not receiving information which
I requested so I appreciate that
you recognize that
and on another note mr chair
just for my constituents out
there I am at this meeting even
though all you can see is.
Okay so so that the record
reflect the rurals and bregose
it's on the edge of the table
and she is all here so you know
we continue to try to do better
rate I mean I think that's the
nature of.
The.
They're always.
Okay any other topics questions
announcements from the
committee.
Okay so the first bill up is my
bill on.
Whenever you're ready mister.
Thank you ma'am chair.
Mentioner house bill one seventy
eight
proposes to reform.
Or game commission.
And i'd like to give a little
background on how we got here
so.
For my entire time in the
legislature
past ten years.
There has been significant
disfunction.
At the camp
under two different governors.
The.
Churn over
in members members being
removed.
Vacancies.
Occasionally not being able to
make a quarter to conduct
business.
Um.
And there's the pattern there's
a prior administration.
Some questionable activities in
terms of passing a rule which.
Was not authorized it was
unconstitutional to boot.
Um.
So real problems and this is
something i'd be working on
fixing.
For most of my time in the
legislature in you know I think
a lot of our members are
especially the republican
members you know we we joined
the legislature the same year
and been on this committee you
know from the get go you'll
remember right I have been
working on this
for least at least eight years.
Last year we had hospital one a
four which changed the way the
game commission was appointed.
At that bill had some by person
sport and house.
Uh I picked up a senate
corresponder by person's
cosponsor
senator diamond now diamond
brantley.
And receive substantial by
persons port in the senate.
Ultimately passing through forty
two.
You moved to the governor of.
Sings your anne was
fetured.
Was actually pocketated and
that's a at another discussion
and I obtained with you on the
floor sometimes doing that.
So that was that was
disappointing.
But
we continue to try the work to
improve the game commission and
the game department.
Represent small and I
met with the governor staff.
Back in august I believe.
In we said won't you work with
us on the package.
To
my original department.
And in my mind that package has
three.
Three parts.
It has commission reform has
mission.
Reform changing the department
of game and fish to a while life
agency.
Then of course includes came.
And increasing the
the fees that they're able to
charge for various licenses.
That was a separate bill last
year which passed the senate
with by parson sport.
And we held it up here in the
house I held up here in the
house because I felt it need to
be part of this overall reform
package.
So we met with the governors and
staff in august.
They told us they were disgusted
the issue with the governor.
And that's the last we heard of
it.
No real interest in working on
this issue.
Um.
Also
you typically this will impeat
your main insurance session then
I didn't ask the governor for a
message because I don't think I
was going to get one.
But since the bill was vetoed.
So
I are distability was hospital
twenty three.
There were two typos in the
bill.
The speaker's office told me it
wasn't identical to the bill
that was better.
So I had the re introduced and
second try with somewhere in the
one fifties I think.
The reserve this communication
with legislative council they
had added in some of the
refinements I had asked for.
In in the amendment
and so that wasn't the same so
here we are with the the third
try in the session.
House bill one seventy eight.
Um.
I will go over the bill and i'd
like to also mention.
I have three amendments prepared
which go along with the sort of
the three prangs of what I think
the reform package.
The.
So
the bill as drafted keeps a
seven member commission.
A three members are effectively
at large members of the public.
In the the restriction I believe
is no more than one from anyone
county and no more than a two
from any political party.
And those are appointed by the
governor.
The original bill said one of
the three one from each
congressional district.
And there was concern about that
because.
There is a congressional I think
berlio county is in all three
congressional districts so we
change that to no more than one
from anyone county.
And then there are four
positions which I consider sort
position appointments they have
serve a little job description.
It's a rancher farmer.
The conservationist a hundred
englar and the scientists.
And occasionally we hear
comments that you know this is
outrageous.
There are several members of the
commission and there's only one
hunter.
And to that I respond.
One hunter is a minimum not a
maximum.
You have the the a large
positions could certainly be
hunters.
The conservationist could
certainly be a hundred any of
these people to be hunters.
Any of these people can be
engaged in agriculture I I mean
these are just voices we want to
ensure we have on the
commission.
It doesn't exclude.
Other members of the commission.
From having.
It provides for staggered terms.
Removal for cars and it makes
the outdoor recreation
commission.
In advisory member to the
commission which which I think
is portant in just opening a
line to communication because I
think part of what we're doing
is with with wildlife with
hunting with fishing is that
recreation component and that's
something I I would like to see.
The.
To me that's something the mesco
has a real strength and then can
you better in in economic
development.
So that that's the bill and it's
it's close to the bill that was
her in this committee last year.
It was amended on the senate
side so there are some of this
provisi.
The amendments which
when we get to commit discussion
will i'll offer the amendments.
The first amendment changes the
appointment of the commission
members.
And the reason I did this was in
the process of hearing the beat
on the bill and the bill working
its way through the system.
It aren't on me that that
allowing the legislative council
to a point the sore position
amendments and let alone the
governor to appoint the at large
amendments.
Didn't really insulate those
appointments from.
And so what what the first
amendment is is is scrapping
that system of three
appointments for the governor
and for for the council service
and replacing it with a
nominating committee.
And this is something I I think
we do with great effectiveness
with judges that we have
nominated income in these for
judges and then the governor
gets to select the judge from a
list of qualified applicants
it's also something we've done
recently with the public
regulation commission.
So part of when we made the
public regulation commission
when the voters made the public
regulation commission appointed
as opposed to elected.
We create a nominating
committee.
And I think I just.
That approach appeals to me so
that the way the name the
incommittee would work is
now forget all the details there
are I I let me see if I can
remember this I think there are
four point minutes for m
legislators.
So speaker that the house
minority leader in the house
said protem minority leader in
the senate all of them get to
point one person to the
nominating me not to the
commission to.
Um.
There are there are two academic
positions one that you and them
in one at the rescue state in
areas specially relevant to the
department and then there's a
tribal appointment that comes
from the governor.
So in the name with you prepare
list of candidates and submit
that to the.
The second amendment is is the
name and mission change.
That that's been included in a
couple bills
is not going to the road
discussion that I bet part of.
But changes the name of the uh
department of came and finished
you
early a while for while life the
partner forget which.
In and expands a refined
admission and this is something
we've seen in most western
states.
That they're moving to more of a
broadbase wildlife focused.
Not just
one of my former clients he
scott hook and bought it you
know while life is more than
hooking.
And then the third moment is the
the fee increased which the
department is asked for this is
important this allows them to
perform their functions is
substantially similar to the
bill that passed the senate last
year with by person support.
I.
Yeah twenty ninety seven.
A couple of the fee categories
were changed.
Um and so those are the members
I hope to discuss and and add to
the bill and I think
you know if
we're successful in doing that.
Then we have sort of a reform
package.
Which is has been a goal of
mine.
And we can continue this
discussion and hopefully move
the bill along and continue it
and.
You know maybe there's an
outside chance we get through
both chambers and we send it to
the governor but
I would like.
Thank you manager.
Thank you mister chairman so
first you're going to go to the
audience if you are opposed to
this bill.
Am I doing it correctly
at your discussion managed here
okay I wasn't sure because you
did the admit you.
I am for it so raise your end of
your post to the bill.
Anyone else supposed to the bill
alright we're gonna go online
does your own line read your
hand if you are opposed to this
bill.
Will start out with oscar
simpson.
The.
May might act as the wrong time
I am for this bill scooby thank
you all right let's go back to
the audience those who would
like to speak on the bill.
And.
Unfortunate unfortunately it
looks like our it problems or
continuing if you like it I can
turn this michael and then we
can't.
All right with the store that
and so if you're in support me
we just do.
The.
Tell us who you are.
Since there's only one person
who spoke.
The.
I don't representatives mike's
own direct in the mexico partner
game in fish and opposition to
the bill as they said earlier we
were going to talk about the
fact that the bill and it's
current form this contrary to
the doctor and of separation of
powers in that it gives the
legislature majority of point
and authority over an executive
branch.
Agency however the sponsor has
obviously recognized that and
changed her nominating
committee.
That change along with the
addition of amendments makes the
bill liberaling in that it
considers a fee increase a
mission change and their
commission reform those three
things are very different things
and should be considered in
separate bills as has been
discussed in other committee
it's very possible that several
dollars individual bills might
not have been considered your
main to this had they've been
done that way and done properly
so for those reasons we stand
against the bill thank you.
Alright let's go ahead and start
a line for those in support of
the bill if ninety seconds.
A good morning committee members
john crentra
president the new mexico
wildlife federation are immore
employee retired long retired
from the game and fish
department I just realized that
effective everywhere one of
their share I joined the
department fifty years ago
and that date and so I have seen
a lot of these fifty years on
one of the things I have seen is
the year.
Kind of cooperation and working
across in our case you might say
the isles with a really broad
corporation of environmental and
apple rights groups too come up
with these bills what you're
saying here was largely drafted
a buyer he coalition with the
help of course of a
representative in the queen
one of the hook opponents that
it is most important to me and
they all
is a license for the increase
the department is absorbing
very well to served
salby increases for the staff
they don't get to her general
and appropriations when those
are made so they take it out of
their existing funds the revenue
stream is relatively flat from
license for sales and federal
way.
And what we're seeing
is a steady revenue stream and
combined that with her the yeah.
Oh cost of living the inflation
a million dollars.
When they last hurt a license
fee increase that went into
effect in two thousand and six
is now it would take a million
and a half too produced.
So we would really hope that
this goes because I think what
we're going to see is we won't
see as there is on the ground
things a while life not a game
and game management alike
habitat projects and other
things that are being delayed
not done circumstances little
bit it'll be on the ground but
it's out of sight and if this
pass today it couldn't go into
effect until open one of two
thousand twenty six and that's
not only the rest of this
political year it's nine months
into the one after that now is
to the other two items we help
try them to support him very
much the game commission reform
and I know that i'm pressing my
time limited here so I will stop

department game in the first
meeting the commission did not
listen to those of us
force about our concerns
increasing the parent from one

increase
the bus.
Good luck wildlife back hb one
seventy eight performing
convention thank you
thank you next is jesse per
shelton.
Good morning madam character
many members and my name is
jessica shelton with animal
protection voters and we
strongly support eight three one
seventy eight there's a done
address as one of one important
piece of
medimany multiple problems
reform needed and and and where
the amendment
chairman mcqueen has has talked
about would address all of those
prants to overhaul in at data
states wildlife agencies per
best funding instruction I would
like to address the comment
about long rolling and short of
the committee that that is
almost certainly not an issue
here with this bill and it is
amendment today and the new
mexico supreme court and april
of last year unanimously upheld
a ballot question under a
challenge stating that the
multiple unconstitutionally lob
rolled multiple proposals were
put into a single ballot
question and the court in that
case determined again
unanimously that all of the
multiple proposals were demanded
to one general purpose or or
objective and so it wise
constitutional the purpose in
that case was the purpose of
reforming a single regulatory
agency and that's the exact same
scenario that is before this
committee thank you so much and
we urge your support thank you
i'm a spoke earlier there's
there at nineteen attendees but
those are all that wanted to
speak all right so we're gonna
go back to the present.
Man chair if I may respond
briefly just a couple of items.
On director sloanes comma about
a separation of power.
Okay point taken that's not
actually why i'm proposing the
change in the committee I just
thought that i'm thinking
committee will be better.
On law growing these are related
wildlife and the department
commission they're all tied
together it's not logo not
logical ruling.
And and your main this
year the tremendous rules are I
I sorry consider them an
obstacle
but as as we all know I think by
now one of the ways bills remain
as a build it's been detailed.
And then once a bill is remain
it may be considered by the
legislature.
And considering a bill
necessarily includes
so that
that's not a problem for this
bill I would also emphasise.
And remain this.
The determinations of germanists
are made by the legislature not
by the executive
thank you matter thank you all
right let's go into your
amendments can you give me your
first two or two number
so the first amendment.
If we could hand that out.
And I don't know
hopefully something up there can
move the amendment i'm not sure
if I should move them and the do
the two the two number two two
numbers two to seven four six
point two.
So we circulated a two two.
Seven four six point one
previously.
I was looking at over this
morning and there was what I
view there's an error in that in
the only change.
So in so two seven four oh six
point two I handed.
That to the attendant just a
moment ago.
An and for that for the analysts
at the only change between the
point one and point two is the
effective date.
So the effective date
of this new system would be the
first day
of the next governor's term
however that governor is and
that the reason was like I i've
been working on this so long I
i've you know hurry been through
one change of administration
that the ideas were going to
start fresh and do not in
committee and we're not gonna
like all the existing game
commissioners terms with end and
we would nominate new members
the the the point one version
had the some of the provisions
taking effect six months ahead
of time which was the drafters
intent that we would organize
the
nominating committee and in get
nominations and.
You know my intent was your on
january first twenty twenty
seven we will have a new new
york members of these various.
Elected officers and those are
the people who are going to
select the number.
All right can I get emotional to
move the amendment about it.
I I think discussion would be
appropriate
so a representative rule moves
and second by representatives
cheers more right.
So many chairman resident
community I I think outlined the
nominating committee before.
It may be we can just go
straight to questions on this
amendment.
The.
I have a couple questions and
related to both your memorial
and the bell itself
representative mcqueen
you said you've been working on
this for about eight years
was there was there ever a study
done.
The.
Um in those eight years
name terrorism brigo.
I don't think there's been a
formal study that's been
commission.
Um
been much discussion there's
been a review of how it works
and other states.
It's it's to me it's an organic
process that hasn't worked down
by or stakeholders and a wide
variety of stakeholders
in the legislature so was there
some sort of.
Helped come to the point just
i'm since I haven't been here
before I
mantate his break representative
now okay so let me ask you th.
Representative
and I and I appreciate that you
know you're looking at this
I heard
on the outside that there were
issues
so how to you anticipate that
this new
organization would improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of
this department or is there
going to be two departments and
i'm confused about that
manchester or is it brigo so
there's the commission and
there's the department and the
commission overseas the
department so they're they're
closely related it's it's a
little bit like the receipt
stream commission.
And then we have
yeah there's a commission and we
called the issue but there's the
agency which is sort of part the
sea and shares office you in the
the commission overseas the
agency and that's the way this
is this is set up so many chair
and representative then the
department would answer to this
commission that is newly
established with these different
rock i'm in these different
players I guess that are being
proposed member chairs and
brigade leave the commission has
been around for a hundred years
the commission has been placed
for a long time.
So it's not a newly established
commission it would be new
members
historically when we get new
governor we get new members
because the currently they serve
at the at the pleasure of the
governor one thing that the
builders which the moment would
carry forward is create terms
and stage terms and removal only
for cause so that in the future
when we get a new governor.
We don't get entirely new
commission there's more
continuity in the membership
okay thank you manager.
The.
The.
Who selects the nominating
committee
um
cherribs of scott
denominating committee
is made up of I believe seven
members.
Um
i'm looking for where it is in
the bill
but if memory serves at seven
members
one appointment each frame the
speaker the minority leader the
same proterm the minority leader
nice chamber
two academic positions
in then one tribal position
appointed by the governor
so the academic positions are
existing positions in our
seat universities
and they would they or they're
designing with sir.
So the government will have
alchemist chair
it was over one of those
positions is that
memchairer says got that is
accurate the governor would have
the final selection on the
members of the commission but
the nominating commission itself
the good bear with the way only
a point one member
made of chairman as to chairman
this would appear with this
process to yield a
fundamental shift in them
mission of this.
Commission.
From one of managing
hunting and fish.
Two one of broadly managing
wildlife in the state is that
mostly accurate.
Manchester replacement scott
as this amendment no
as to the the next amendment
which changes the mission yes
I will say we're getting a
little off this amendment but I
will say the
department has argued argue that
they don't need a mission change
or a name change because they
are a due manage other wildlife
so I don't know how fundamental
it is I think it is in evolution
of their mission I don't think
it's uh I found the mel change.
But yes that's night in this
amendment
I am chairman of true.
Who provides revenues.
Fund
came a trish.
Mancher rips guide in excellent
question and one that we had
been very functious of
the existing revenue they did
get some general fund money last
year I think was seven million
nine million or something like
that I think seven
but for the most part their
funds come from honey and
fishing licenses in the federal
robertson pitmanac rubs and
petman pin runs
so they're currently funded
extensively from
hundreds of angers and it's a
it's very clear to all of us
involved that if we expand their
mission we need to expand their
funding there were not asking
the hundreds of englars to
continue to be the only people
that
effectively find the agency
through buying licenses so we
would definitely be working on
that funding and that's part of
the reason for its laid
inflamentation of portions of
the bill.
That made him chair mr chairman
there is no provision in.
Is that the original bill or.
Any of these amendments that
would provide for example the.
Anyone else having two
aid account at the table
mentioner is in scott we have
considered other funding
mechanisms I I think er
no them around the bill
and we would be looking at
either general fund money or
at one point it looks like there
is a potential that really
substantial
expansion with federal phones
with the.
Rawa recovering america while
they fact that that bill
sponsored by senator hynrick was
dropped from a big om the best
bill also didn't get past
they're still working on that so
that that could be in the
pipeline at some point.
So madame chair mister you would
address the concern of the
hunters and anglers that are
currently paying for the agency.
The.
This while this legislation
would
necessarily I think reduce the
inslots of honors and anglers.
With this legislation they would
continue to be.
Then first majority of the
funding is that
does it remain
up accurate.
It is hundreds and anklers are
paying
through their fees to manage the
wildlife the
running and phishing and now it
would appear as though the
environmental community and
other waterlife entrists would
be
getting a significant additional
influence without
any.
Any more skin in the game if you
could you address it
managed here to have scott again
your concern is valid and noted
in i'm confident will be
addressed it is not there is not
a separate funding mechanism in
either of the bill or the
legislation
or the amendments i'm properly
and less this a less question
made of chair mister chair with
respect to the commissioner
removal provisions
who makes that determination.
Um.
Mancher ribs got
death termination I believe
would be made it's actually a
good question.
The.
I would think the governor
since the giver may see
appointments yes I think i'll go
with it so the gun makes the
final appointments to give her
could take to remove a
commissioner there is a process
there standards and this this
man chair says guide and members
of the committee for those
who don't know this process was
lifted I think from uh
legislation relaying to the
regions.
And as a way of inslaying them
from political pressure.
The.
Mr chairman have made him chair
mr chair.
The given the
wide veriety of interests that
would be represented here
it would seem to me
that uh
neglect of duty mail seasons in
office.
Certainly could become
contentious.
Given the very us interests
that would now be represented.
The process could you describe
the process how might do how
much that function given the
wide variety of
of wildlife interested would be
represented with this new
commission.
Mentarities got I imagine a
you would see a letter from the
governor
removing a member stating the
grounds
are the language provides for
notice of hearing an opportunity
to be heard.
So hearing would be scheduled
and all sides could present
their position
the sure in court has exclusive
original justician to conduct
that hearing.
This
I don't think it would be easy
to remove someone and I don't
think it would be common dreams
and that sort of thing all that
you can remove someone ma'am
terrorism scott you know if
there's something clearly wrong
there they're not showing up
there.
Allegation improving that sort
of thing.
But it's an it's it's not just
your removed it's you have an
opportunity to respond and
there's an independent
essentially try to fact that
would make that decision
I haven't chaired mr chair thank
you for that answer.
I have feel like this might.
Eliminate at least some of the
political accountability
making it that much harder to
remove.
Commission.
And.
Particularly.
With game and fishing issues in
this state.
Where many people are
passionate.
Of all be interested to listen
to the rest of the discussion
both but I note that I would I
think I would be
on the
on the side of more not less.
Political accountability is.
One of these or more of these
appointments terms out to be
less than ideal.
Thank you madame
then terrorism scuff I may
respond appreciate that I know I
I hear you
I would suggest it that one
person to canability is another
person's influence so it's it's
about.
Thank you madame chair and thank
you mister chairman for your
representative scott anyone else
have questions.
Thank you madame chair mister
chair I believe in
one of your answers to
representative or against
westerns you said that there was
some review process of
other states and what they were
doing is that correct
manager have heard there has
been a
large group of state holders
that have been working on this
issue for a long time and it is
not been there not no dispublic
meetings they're not a task for
us there hasn't been more
anything like that but
interested parties who have who
have met together and
occasionally with legislators
and i've been working on this
for a long time this isn't what
the situation where legislators
have been excluded
and III think it's really
interesting who's attending
these these meetings there are
you know while they
preservationists there are
hunters and englands there are
you know animal cruelty
prevention advocates is wide
ranging and
the the group that's been
working on it has worked really
well together because there's a
lot of the common ground both
in.
Recognizing the current is
function and agreeing that we
can do better and how we can do
better.
Thank you mister chairman madame
chairman are matter madame chair
person sorry and mister chairman
I was just curious as to what
other states were reviewed and
how they handle this situation.
Manager over some memory I I
don't have an extra with me
today I could defer to you that
would be
useful in this case most western
states have a wildlife agency
and have gone away from a game
in fish agency
thank you mister chair
madame chair mister chair
in I think both the
the bill and in this amendment
there is a.
Provision
about how a person should not be
eligible to be appointed if the
person has changed party
affiliation during the previous
four years is there
and I am not a constitutional
law expert by no means I I just
worry about the free speech
implications of that provision
is that something you could
address
manchesters and embry I I don't
think you have a first minute
right to be appointed to a
committee
the reason that provision is in
there is in
hopefully that recently but then
past years the way that
positions on commissions are
committees were filled when you
had had to have by person
representation was you just got
while your friends to change the
party and then you pointed them
october that we're just trying
to protect against that abuse
okay III and I do appreciate
that I understand the potential
for abuse there and I I
appreciate that I just.
I'm sorry madam chair
madame chair mr I I appreciate
that I just was not sure how I I
understand you don't have a
constitutional right to be
appointed.
Sorry kind of thinking about i'm
just not i'm new to this and
sorta filling things out
madame chair mister chair my
last
kind of thing is one.
The sort of the removal process
and or whatever it seems to me
there are two sort of mechanisms
separate mess mechanisms of
removal the first one in
subsection f seems to be self
executing while the the second
one in section g requires some
sort of hearing process with
original jurisdiction
before the supreme court would I
would that be correct and how
that works.
Men chairs of embry yes
thank you madame chair mister
chair.
On the self execution
I guess the self executing
portion
there it is when a
commissioner no longer meets the
qualifications who is
responsible for making that
determination.
Met chairs of embry
I I think that's termination
could be flagged by anyone.
I I would hope the governor's
office who is responsible for it
while under the amendment who
would be results for the
appointments
is on top of that
could a
member of the public sea a
commissioner moves away could a
member of the public bring suit
to remove the commissioner at
you
maybe I don't know that that's a
location question that beyond my
expertise thank you mr chair
madame chair
mr chair
well I appreciate that that if
it's citizens as hey.
This commissioner moved from
this county to this county now
we have to commissioners in one
county.
But it seems to be self
executing they don't need to.
File suit correct.
Um.
The.
Yeah it's it's a tricky question
man chair or seven it is suffer
executing as you say but if it
set the self executing and they
continue to show up meetings and
participate in the commission as
if they were
a commissioner.
At you then maybe you need some
sort of intervention.
I appreciate that thank you and
and and that
madame chair mister chair.
So if one moves
and if if you can only have one
from a certain county a
commissioner moves into another
county from which there is
already a commissioner which one
of them is no longer qualified
man chairs
seems reclaired to me that the
commissioner that moved with no
longer be qualified I am that's
not stated in the in the
amendment but just young think
he get through that with bd
logical result.
Thank you mister chair and
madame chair final follow up
mister chair would that also
apply to someone switching
political parties
they were no longer be qualified
correct maintainers embry I
believe
okay thank you very much mister.
The.
And.
Madame chair if there's no
further questions from the
members I moved to adopt the
amendment.
Call them if we do it this way
right or can I just say there's
no objections but we have any
objections.
You haven't okay so let's do a
quick role c.
Yes madam chair representative I
go support the amendment
representative dick then
representative garcia
are president of hembry no
representative montoya
president of rubio
isn't it a scat
business of small.
A president of town.
Madame chair yes.
Mister chairman yes.
Seven years
by a buyer voted 7ou haven't
adopted amendment
it's going to the next amendment
can you tell me their two or two
number you want to do next
the two or two number of the
next amendment is two two seven
four oh four point one.
Can I get a motion to the
amendme.
Mention members of the community
the second moment is the mission
and name change
in it.
As I said before of you this as
an evolution of the of the
agency I do actually think the.
The mission statement and the
the name is important
in in terms of the
outlook and philosophy of the
agency
and then it's like.
So focused on hunting and
fishing.
Um.
The.
It changes the name of the
agency.
By reference in different areas
of law.
Because you know the old.
The.
Came in fish commission
depermine gimme fish commission
is the name that appears over
never.
And they expand and has some
clear playing ridge
and explains that the department
to include other while life
species.
Her thousand and four questions.
Thank you madame chair chair.
The issue that i'm dealing with.
Is
the
interest to change
the make up of the commission
in the process they're
or is the real intent to change
the whole department and their
missions statement when I read
the first line of the.
Bill.
Definition
it says reforming the state game
commission appointment process.
When I start thinking of
the amendments
and what testimony I have heard.
It's bigger than that is and my
misreading it madam chair and
german mancher was in towns in I
think the the intention is a
thorough reformable to
commission and the department
so I don't think you're
misreading it.
Well I am madam chair.
I I represent a lot of people
that have great concerns with
the commission i'll make no
bumps about it and I have voiced
many of those that the commi.
I'm concerned.
And i'm getting a little off of
the amendment that before us but
when I look at the total
t of all of the amendments.
The.
The changes although.
I do believe changes are
warranted of making no bunds
about that I think the scues
what those people that I
represent
feel appropriate
mancher and and miss chairman
the amendment that we're looking
at right now.
Has a declaration of poli.
And when I read that I think it
it conforms with your
earlier answer that you're
you're over your purpose system.
The read reconfigure the not
only the process of the
commission but the purpose of
the department.
And
representative bregno earlier.
Ask about
what
what's dead he had been done but
but.
Who had orchestrated been
involved in the process I have
gotten a number of comments from
people in different industries
out figures owners and general
and they are
they would side with you and I
but changes are are warranted
better concerned that the
where we're going
they don't understand questions
have been on the next amendment
on the fee increases questions
have been on this amendment as
to purpose.
M
can you david a little more in
in the new language as to
provide for the conservation and
management of the states were
all life as a public trust
restores.
Within transit and ecological
value as well as for the benefit
us
apply and non concern the
enjoyment of.
At first read that doesn't
bother me and then I i'm you
know the devils.
Madame chair
when you think about.
Reconforming the purchase of the
department.
What do you believe that changes
are that the department needs to
meet in order to satisfy
those people that you represent.
The.
Mentioners in towns in.
So I think I represent the
people my district
and people the state and I
represent
people they have an interesting
conservation people they have
interest in hunting
people to have an interest in
recreation and people who don't
have an interest in any of
this to me is that the statement
that you read is
he broad statement the policy I
think it is inclusive not
exclusive I and I think that's
good
I I know there's a concern among
some that
there's a desire to
end hunting and fishing
and.
The certainly not my desire it's
not the purpose of the bill
wouldn't be allowed into the
bill or any of the amendments
it's pretty inconceivable to me
that that would happen.
Because of
the white history of having
fishing the deep cultural
significance of hanning and
fishing.
Significant economic benefit of
hunting and fishing this isn't
is it about that.
To me what this is and i'll say
begins at evolution of the
agency and whether it reminds me
of manchers and towns and is.
We used to have the highway
department
in their way of a department
transportatio.
Because we realize that
there their mission and their
role was broader than just
highways
now and and I think the the
mission role of the permanent
image this is or should be.
Rather than handing in fishing
I I think this change your over
the three amendments I think
this is probably the more the
most controversial the three
now
I also think it's the future now
it's it's coming because it's
appropriate and we're we're not
trying to do this to the the
detriment of anyone.
The.
I appreciate the german medicare
i'll continue to listen to the
discussion and dome but those
are the questions that i'm i'm
building the day and them so i'm
sure i'll have more questions
manager thank you mister.
Thank you representative any
more questions
okay repeated sc.
Thank you matter
mister chairman when he asked
this
question as.
Is an example of one of my
concerns does this if this isn't
legislation becomes law
what the department of game in
fish.
Be responsible for the.
Well fair of the three towed
sandon lizard in southeast new
mexico
ma'am chair reserve sky as I
understand that the
the structure of this still
allows the game commission to
elect to be responsible for
the species or not and
the reason that is the case is.
There are a lot of things there
wild by nature and i'd like I
know that the commission doesn't
be responsible for it codes
right they don't want to be
responsible for for at they're
not an extermination service
there are wild creatures out
there that really wouldn't fall
under the perview of the
commission
a threatened or endangered
species
I think should be under the
perview of the commission and I
think the to me that the the the
goal of
the federal and interest pieces
act and other threatening
endangered species preservation
efforts as always been to.
Conserve and restore those
species to a level sufficient
that they don't inhibit other
activities right if we have
healthy populations of
threatened and endangered
species
such that they can be delisted.
Then they no longer restrict
other activities so man chairers
have sky I am not familiar with
the species you reference and
that the percent sure if it's
real or hypothetical is it a
real species.
Yeah.
Met from terror chairman.
I can assure you
the debt lizard is of
significant concern
better since you have turned up
I I wasn't familiar with it but
yeah we want to see that that
table
right now
under the last administration
the state stopped participating
wolf recovery efforts
that end stop will for coverage
efforts it just we just give up
our seated at the table I think
that would be a mistake so are
they responsible for the welfare
of that species.
I went for it that way are they
involved in the conservation and
that species and and an efforts
to conservative species I would
hope so.
But madame chair mister chairman
today.
The game and fish department is
not primarily responsible for
the welfare of that lizard is
that
man chairers have scott
considering I didn't know the
lizard existent few moments ago
I will I I believe that's
accurate I don't think this bill
changes that I don't think it
makes them primarily responsible
for the wealth her
there's there's probably a lot
of them
details and and and facts to
play in that in that analysis
that I i'm sorry I can't comment
on more thoroughly.
And madam chair mr chairman let
me ask you the same question
about
wolf.
It just came and fish.
Have any significant interaction
with the maintenance of that
species today
ma'am tear reps in the sky again
I believe that a federal effort
and we should be involved in
them.
Here the idea that the federal
government would be in the
mexico doing something that were
not consulted on.
Would it be would it be your
representation madam chair
mister chairman.
That there are no advocates for
the.
Jumping mouse to.
The world population
in the state today work in state
government
or there is no agency charged
with interaction with
environmental protection for
those non game species so many
cheers have scott
that would not be make
contention my understanding and
this is again why I view this as
a and evolution more than a
fundamental change you're in the
department has their position as
been that they don't need a
change in mission because
they're already involved
so there's a little bit man
chair reserves got there's some
semantics gone on there
better chairman's determined up
a sort of view this is
game animals.
In wildlife.
Or
on a fan diagram intersecting.
The the interest of that one
stagement do not always
even closely coincide with the
interest of that other segment
in asking game and fish or
whatever the new ones and we
called.
It seems seems a bit like trying
to fit a square pig into a round
hole
oh
that's their hope you'll be
pleased to listen to the rest of
the discussion but that is my
concern thank you sir thank you
thank you representative scott
next is represented montoya
thank you
thank you madame chair and
mister chair.
Mister chair I
my concerns are all a little
different my concerns are.
Not what I believe is your
actual intent.
I actually I I think I think
you've worked this bill over
time to make it.
Better
I think some of the timelines
that you.
Set some of the arguments.
Aminable to.
My concern is not intent.
Um my concern is.
The.
White potential.
Unintended cons.
Miss chair
we've lived through a time my
family's from from north central
new mexico live through the time
where the great economy there
was logging.
And and.
Many of my relatives and
extended relatives and lost
there was there livelihood do
too the spotted out
we've seen the.
Through message will legitimate.
Process looking at endangered
species.
But currently mister chair here
in the mexico we have a huge.
Water crisis.
And.
About sixty percent of all the
water that comes into new mexico
comes into my county and.
But in years when we've had
drought.
In particular because of the
upper san juan silvery minnow.
Designation as an endangered
species even though the silvery
mental exists virtually on all.
Rivers across
the rocky mountains area but
because the specific designation
of the sand one county the upper
sale one county silvery meno.
Even during times of drought we
have to have prescribed.
Releases of water.
Out of.
The damn.
And that and in madam chair
that's through a legitimate.
Process of determining whether
there's an endangered species
might my concern.
Madam chair.
Is that with an expanded board
with an expanded mission.
I'm concerned that a board.
Could potentially.
Start making some considerations
just because the of the change
of the the boards.
Um.
Mission.
And I think you're right I think
this is the most pray the most
conservative are most
controversy of all the things
that you're putting forward and
I don't really need to do you
can respond if you want to but
that's the biggest reason I
can't support this as I I see I
see what the unintended
consequences have been on a
couple of things and I I think
some of the fire danger that we
have now has come from what used
to be removal systematic removal
of when it wouldn't have clear
cutting on.
We weren't really losing habitat
we had sitting going on I think
the fire dangers in some of the
things we have experience have
been unintent of consequences of
a very.
I think people who really have a
valid concern of of certain
things.
But i'm worried that.
The processes that we currently
have.
That protect animals.
The.
And a a different process that
goes on I think that could be
potentially transferred to a
group that has a different
missus mission that then opens
us up as well too further and
lawsuit to force this board to
do things that
currently there's there's other
routes to do that so that that
is my concern mister chair is
just the just a wall of
unintended consequences here and
and I don't think it goes at all
towards.
I think you've been very clear
about what you what you believe
why believe it
when I my respect you for.
For for free beliefs I I just
think that that this is this
down the road.
Consequences are are too high
for.
Thank you representative anymore
questions.
Lamp chair
center on the amendment i'm
trying to turn a kind of
ornate the sequence seen
of your first amendment with the
second amendment
madame chair and the
chairman and.
You know on the first take.
I couldn't see a conflict
for one
on the first amendment we struck
section one it in its entirely
pages one through five.
So
that section is gone in the
first a member you put in
a redoom of section one.
But then your second amendment.
Many chair that's good number
three
which is on page two.
And the number three
then faces back to that deleted
section.
On page four line nine strike
number two and insert and do
their up eleven
week you've already struck that
section.
But then you're referring to it
and your second amendment so I I
have problems kind of
understanding the sequences.
Of the second amendment in
relation to the first amendment
especially in that section that
was taken up and redone.
Er man tear rives in gracia.
Because the amendments are so
substantial
I had conversations with the
council service
about how to.
Sequence as you say and at one
point there is a plan to have
multiple variations of the
amendments that like there is a
specific order and different
variations if if they weren't
all adopted either adopted or
adopted in that were in it was
just really complicated and so
that my last communication from
the council service was.
Present him in mids who adopt
him in mince.
We would send the amendments
back up to the council service
to make sure that in the
committee report.
They were consistent in cohesive
is that you're you're right you
know that the pagination in the
references and it's it's
challenging this is
this would be a really good time
to have a committee substitute
because the bill was remained
because it was vetoed I didn't
want to start off with the
committee substitute I wanted to
do a moment
it's it's possible that as is
moving forward I am I commit to
that
the the amendments if they are
adopted
there there's going to be
scrutiny from the council
service assistance from the
council service to make sure
that they
don't have conflicts
that's.
You're your concern is is valid
and noted in that how I proposed
to address it thank you manager
and mister ch.
Thank you rips and gracia next
is charter small that they very
much manage her thank you mister
chair for I really appreciate
the clarification questions from
themselves garcia in appreciate
sort of understanding that way
forward madam chair mister chair
this a lot of this work right
now is being done in different
ways by the.
Could be more involved I think
there's benefits for us having
them widely involved in areas
but there are none game programs
with
non game species that I won't
find when I do my applications
for for hunting for this
upcoming year there are going to
be species that the department
interacts with spends money with
in fact that aren't there that I
can't put my dry in for a
hundred licenses that write
mentaries that have small yes
okay manager
and chair so were
really opening and bringing us
into more of a open ability to
interact with those species the
proactively engaged with them
but it's not necessarily
something new across many speci.
In his.
Teams work on a wide right I
followed both department again
fish on facebook and we see a
lot of non game species that
they're interacting with their
was that
not asking you to check facebook
but
just reinforcing that a lot of
the nine game.
Moved here small I I do my best
avoid facebook but I will take
your word for it okay thank you
manager thank you mr chair I
really I see steps forward here
I think the fact that there's
broad support and that concerned
voices while still for sure you
know a lot of different
questions it may remain think
what we see here today is a
level and in a lack of
opposition frankly that speaks
to a lot of progress it's been
made in more and more folks
seeing are
hopes for the future and what is
the fourth most bill diverse
state reflected more and mor.
With the clarification that the
amendments will be
worked through by council
service to b.
Next as representative rubia.
Representative rubio in a second
buy representative dixon.

number is

And in this point of version was
circulated previously so this is
substantially the fee increased
bill which passed the senate
last year a couple of the
fees were changed but this is
this is really the portion of
the build that the department
wants because it helps
as public testimony indicated

yeah thank you all through your
discussion and the amendment the
amendments.
Our big chunk of the bill
we have in them in the bill i'm
happy to answer any questions on
the amended bill.
Representative thoughts.
Thank you man fair chair.
With respect to your last
amendments which is the one I
quite frankly.
You said the department wanted
to know this like the most can
can you describe
your over a year
department income for the last
three years.
Them terribles intensity I
cannot
madam chair would it be
appropriate to ask the
representative came on fish to
describe that sure would you
like would you.
Item chair representative we
bring in about thirty twenty
eight to thirty million dollars
you're in license.
And man journalist care and
in the last three years has that
been an increase or decrease
you're over a year
madame chair representative most
of our hands are over subscribed
so it's a steady state we have
more applicants than we have
licenses to actually bring in
about the same amount every
year.
Well.
Madam chair mr chair I probably
shouldn't
I guess I won't direct any
further questions to you
that I certainly have.
In my district manager
which german director flown
there has been a significant
negative impact
to the ranching community in
particular because of the
impact.
Of
the management
of the elk
the sacrament jumping mounts
and the inability
of the US department of game and
fish to coordinate their efforts
with the new mexico game and
fish and i'm not putting blame
on anyone i'm just onya it's a
math.
And
their has been a significant
increase in the elk population
in that district year older year
for the last
twenty years I believe maybe
even further than that
but if there has not been.
If there hasn't been an increase
in the income derived from that
species.
While the inhabitants in the my
constituents are continued to be
armed
I don't think that's fair
and I certainly don't think it's
fair when we have madame
chairman share increases.
Count permit is going from three
hundred and fifteen dollars to
five hundred and fifty dollars.
That
reps got robbery's got his
calculator but that's about an
eighty percent increase if I
didn't miss it
I look at the board.
Permit the going from five and
ordered a seven hundred and
fifty do.
Madame chairman and
representative when you look at
these no proposed fees what is
the and what is the impact to
the department
expected
financially mantas intention I
do not have the.
Well madame chair maybe I spoke
to soon director slow
surely as the director you have
run the math
madame chair representative I
also don't know as I don't know
what changes.
I understand that represent.
Madam chair and.
Mister chair.
Do he have an fire that would
have the impact of this proposed
member.
Mim tariffs and towns I believe
there isn't.
It should be in your book
correct.
The.
I believe it's on the bill but.
So
them chair director slown if it
helps the if you had the the
figures from last year sent the
changes I made were increases in
a couple categories so would not
be less than.
Madame chair representative
assuming that's correct
we estimated an approximately
ten million dollar annual.
Something that we're talking
about
the same
so madame chairman
that's a thirty three percent
increase that we're asking you
said yet a thirty million
dollars
revenue stream we're going to
increase that by ten million so
we're going to go to forty at
thirty three percent increase is
that correct
madame chair representative but
I believe that math is correct
although I would say that any
increase
will last us the last increase
we had was two thousand and six.
I I want to be clear that i'm
not here advocating for.
I don't know exactly what's in
the bill it does at this point
and it's unclear.
Perfect increase to except
everything else.
The.
Well manager
mr jared dreadful and I
appreciate that I am.
The thing
if I might
that I hear from the mexicans
better than I represent within
my district them I know that we
all represent is we have three
and a half billion dollars in
the money this year and we
constantly are going back to a
people they have to pay more for
this or that and yet it's not
setting well many people
I also understand
and right frankly you.
Agree with the fact that
the rate structured that the
game of fish department
utilizes.
Should in my opinion be
adjusted to
inflationary measures
on an annual basis whether it's
affordable
but
having a rate.
Change ever twenty years is not
going to conducive the good
management
and is not conducive to the well
being of the employee then a
department
so many chair representative i.
Again I I think you're on the
sample I told you that last
year.
I think there's desperate need
for changes.
I'm not comfortable with these I
haven't had enough time to go
through
but I
I don't want game in fact.
Politicized any more than it is.
I want my constituents to be
treated
responsibly
to the impact of the management
of the species that is deprimal
that they're well being
and that's not happening i've
talked to about it I don't I I
have serious concerns with it
I noticed that a couple of
changes so many chair and and
share one was we were changing
for post changing from
department of agg partner of
interior in in the bill language
did did I miss
that was in the last amendment
can you expound on that little
bit that I miss that
mantere rivers towns in
me we change the name of the
state agency uh there was there
were some clean up edit
which I
don't have expertise in they can
the the terminology the name of
the name of some federal acts
and things like that I don't
know you obviously we can't
change the name of the federal
agency nor are we changing
you know how the the age the
state agency is oriented towards
his federal agencies you know if
the technical changes
look like that can't change my
assumption was that that was
reflecting current law.
The.
Or maybe.
There that wouldn't be the first
mistake i've ever made reading a
bill but when i'd look at page
three
the second minute
under section five
the new underlying language.
Years to change that the acts
and rolls and regulations are
more gated.
By the and
what is strick in this sector of
agriculture and what is the
insurgents united states
secretary of the interior their
under and i'm trying to follow
but that really means and what
the impact.
Um
chair resident towns in my
assumption and I did not house
was that was a technical change
to conform to
how the law actually works on
federal.
The member of chairman towns of
that change came from the
council service yeah not from us
and I appreciate that I just.
I thought the direction
might have impact in the
promotation of.
The changes and I was trying to
understand
why the change.
You know representative
mr chair manager
one of the things that I can't
stand leave here from
point to the legislature is the
bill there we passed last year
that I was a trapping bill
which the department.
And
I I get it that we all represent
different.
But the impact
that impact i've heard already
this morning is
a
rim that.
Reluctance to except changes
there are so.
There are so demonstrably.
And known I mean we we know
their wide sweeping but we're
not sure but what impact are
going to have this cause.
I appreciate your after and
and referred to.
It's it would stress me to
tell you that i'd.
Changes are warranted
i'm very concerned that these
are so unknown that I can't
support but i'd like to be able
to thank you
thank you representatives of
next is represent garcia thank
you ma'am chair and mister chair
mr chair I I just have kinda
one.
Can a clarifying.
Issue in a deals with them with
directors loans
comments in an opposition to
legislation.
And the manager
he mentioned that the bill.
And conflict in terms of log
wrong.
And.
My understanding in terms of the
concept of log rolling.
Madam chair is that it only
applies to constitutional
amendments.
Is that your understanding
mister chair
manager ribs that's not my
understanding but I wouldn't say
my understanding is.
Firm or detailed you know I
went.
Um.
I don't know that the answer to
that might I guess my assumption
would apply to the ordinary
statutes like you wouldn't see a
your game commission and tell
the advocacy bill rate I I mean
those would be to disperate
topics that should be treated in
separate legislation to me all
this is is intricately related.
I just I i'm not concerned about
the log
thank you manager you know
mister chair think all raised
the question with the
legislative council.
For my own you know for my own
known
under.
That is my understanding i've
only seen this issue of
liberaling in my twenty seven
years up here.
Address two costs to members but
all.
Manager thank you.
I think representative garcia
next is represented himba
thank you madame chair mister
chair
a few moments ago
director sloane
said that.
There had not been a v increase
in twenty years and I realize
that the cost of doing business
has gone up a lot over the last
twenty years
but then I think he followed it
up followed that up with
so maybe these should last
another twenty years did I hear
that correctly I believe them
chairers have every
I believe she made that steep
I would if I may respond to your
question in
reserve towns its comment with
note that the amendment we
adopted as a cpo gesture
yes thank you
thank you mister chair madame
chair mister that was my point
that I think that that section
see there has a a yearly
provides for the opportunity to
adjust those fees yearly.
So
I guess
madam chair mister chair
one concerned I have and and
using representative towns and
example of the
what seems to be lack of game
management with the elk
population in his part of the
world is that
rather than managing game the
the department has been
purchasing land
and
this.
Change in the mission of
the department allows them to
further continue this ability
and rather expand it so that
they are not really a game
management but they're buying
land for conservation taking it
off the tax roles
of localies and the counties are
losing.
Property tax money.
At the could you address that
ma'am chair reserve embry I
believe that the department very
infrequently acquires
manchesters and hermerate they
did acquire
large ranch recently
it's not double aged I bar did
no listen name of their engine
elbow
that was a separate
appropriation
you know land acquisitions.
There's a lot of fear around the
inacquisitions.
Land has expensive.
We're talking about if you know
this fee increase in place
you have ten million dollars in
inco.
Income to the agency that's not
for violin the agency isn't out
there requiring a bunch of land
the the bar had it it's on
appropriations on process
it wasn't the agency actually
thank you
thank you madame chair that is
all ahead.
Thank you manager minimum chair
mister chair
couple of questions first madam
chair mister chair the regarding
on it income in the fees side
it's my understanding that a
number of wildlife departments
or other the same sort of
department in neighboring states
do far more proactive
conservation work with land.
Is that you're understanding man
chair ribs
okay madam chair mister chair I
want to for to spend a little
bit of time there I think it's
super important for us that
private land owners in other
states with wildlife departments
that regardless of the political
makeup of those states have a
far more engaged involved and
frankly proactive wildlife
interface from th.
Madame chair mister chair is
that your sense of man chair
represents us and managed her
mister chair weaken that can be
an all sorts of things that can
be in
habitat management that can be
in wildlife studies that.
In access and open gate.
Man terrible representative
small yes great in madam chair
mister chair I think if we move
forward with this legislation
today with the components it's
my strong sense that it won't
make us better able to be better
partners with private land
owners actually alleviate.
Yeah.
Ma'am chair resents fall yes I
mean this to me as part of the
evolution of the agency great
man chair mister chair I think I
appreciate that it's such an
important point we are the
fourth most by our dev.
Certainly
as well as sovereign tribes
other stakeholders to maximise.
Benefits of our biodiversity and
minimize.
Um.
Madame chair and mister chair so
the in that
thing that amongst.
In the past.
Although there have been
statements of a lot interest is
today the first.
Er manager reserves small yes I
I would
note as recent sky pointed out
our process of publicising
amendments you know has not been
good
you perhaps people aren't as
aware of the amendments you know
if this build advances maybe
we'll hear additional discussion
in subsequent committees okay I
am sure mister chair I I
appreciate that
it seems to me.
No interest is sort of season
selves as getting a leg up many
folks see themselves is taking
the step forward so nobody's you
know nobody's being left behind
some we see a lot of steps
forward that are dependent on.
The.
A stable and inc.
That's a positive step forward
these are very challenging
madame chair mister chair many
folks don't.
The fact that were really in a
state of car.
Either very.
Thank you mister chairman next
is represent.
We still have two other bills.
But we have the other people
thank you madame chair
and mister chair of the the l
bar ranch is that the ranch look
is at located.
As well.
Because of the prior.
A separate purchase
man cheers a month
I I don't know what county the
delbar's in I do think I heard
something
about perhaps what you're
talking about
you know I again I was just
state.
The department start in the
position going out enquiring
lay
I I
sincerely and fully believe that
there are appropriate times for
the government to acquire land
that they don't already hope.
And including in the situation
where you have a threatened
error dangerous species which
would facilitate the
constitution that species and
also remove the burden of the
conservation that species from a
private land that are and I
would also note that all of the
acquisitions are any of the
acquisitions have been
volunteer.
You were not talking about in
the domain we're not talking
about taking land.
We're talking about landowners
who seek um
her menable to this kind of
transaction.
Thank you mister chairman.
Our manager mister chair.
I understand that I just look at
the total landmass across the
mexico there is already owned by
the state at where and and or by
the federal government it's just
it is just a consideration
missed a matter of sharing
mister chair just just one
comment
I I just bill is going to go out
of here and it's getting me to
go to judiciary I would suggest.
That it would be appropriate to
do a committee subso it's
understandable I think it's a
very dangerous thing to.
Have a bunch of confused lawyers
in the room
i'm i'm not sure that.
Thank you mister chair man
terrorism at motoria might be a
dangerous thing to have a bunch
of lawyers.
Think you represent a montoya
next is represented break thank
you madame chair and I would
argue that it's probably not
good to have a bunch of lawyers
in the legislature but that's
another issue
so madam chair and
mister chair
one of the things that I and i'm
gonna help bring another
perspective to this because I
did grow up in northern new
mexico I have a lot of family
ignore it and they are dependent
on fishing
all
dear etc just to feed their
families and we're raising those
fees which I understand
according to some of my
colleagues is minimal but when
you're trying to feed your
families in your dependent on
those particular
err species to eat over a period
of time
and when we're giving you know
tax refunds because we agree
that new mexico is a
estate that is basically
impoverty
and then we're also giving
refunds for these to encourage
all of these things but yet
we're raising fees for families
who are dependent on these
particular species over time to
feed their families
I really take issue with this
and I I have to tell you I have
some of those family members
that are struggling.
You know on a to go get wood so
they can sell word just to feed
their families
and and I understand that
according to some of our
representatives it's minimal but
when you're trying to struggle
from week to week or month to
month just to survive
it's it's an impact madam chair
and and mister chair
eight the other thing and just
that's just with the fee
structure
in overall I mean just the bill
itself
I just you know and I mentioned
this earlier is eight years
we've been working on this but I
see no comprehensive
information that tells me I need
to be voting in favor of this
change and i'm hearing from a
department director that's
basically telling me make
mountain chair and mister
charles that and I think you
have the right intentions mister
charit and you know I I really
do I think that you're looking
over all at all of the species
in new mexico and I happen to
deal as the city counselor with
our work population in our
coyote population and
albuquerque that was one of the
things and I had the response
from the game of this department
immediately
because they were they were
killing you know residents dogs
then they were doing things that
and and
respectfully director your your
department was right on top of
it immediately and I respect you
for that
but when i'm hearing madame
chair and mister chair a
department director whose
manager's department I don't
know how long and I don't know
you sir but probably for a while
it's kind of telling me that
they're involvement has been
minimal.
In this bill
it really concerns me mister
chair and and madame chair
that
not everybody again is at the
table to make in these changes
and that we we don't in eight
years we don't have any studies
that I can look to to say yeah
this is the appropriate
direction that we should be
going in
and I respectfully mister chair
you know appreciate your work in
your intention but I still don't
have that and finally madam
chair and mister chair.
I truly and you have
understanding my background I
come I am a former bureaucrat
for twenty eight years plus
and you know city counselor I
don't I think that there are
roles that
you know the administration has
executive branch in the
legislative branch and I think
sometimes those rolls cross and
you know
we we.
Probably all want this the best
for our legislation but.
I'm struggling with the roles
here is are we.
Are we sort of diving into
reorganization of a department
which really is an executive
administrative.
Inction
then I understand the fee
structure which I think it
legislature does have the
abilities to set that
you know the legislature does
certainly have the ability to to
discuss the policy but i'm still
struggling mister chair and
mountain chair with the whole
issue of.
The lack of information that
that provides the justification
for doing this so without being
said manager I
but I do I do want to raise
madame chair the whole issue of
increasing fees for residents
because of the comments that I
made earlier.
Mentioner members of the
committee
I probably share ordered lunch
sorry about that
and yet this has been an
interesting discussion right
because there's a lot of
acknowledgment that we need to
do something
I am chair I would like to say
that in terms of the department
not being at the table
that's been their choice.
We asked them repeatedly.
To engage with us on this issue
and they decline
in terms of the fees I I would
know their substantial
differences between resident and
unresolved.
So we do have a we do have it
serve in state preference and we
also have senior and better and
discounts
could we do more there that's
something we could look at you
know I appreciate that.
You have obly I would just say
changes hard
that's that doesn't mean it's
not needed.
I just think there's at some
trepidation around this bill
you have intended consequences
things like that it's new it's
different I get that.
But I also paying changes
necessary and in this case
changes warranted and and we're
ready to.
Thank you manager.
Yeah.
Dixon
all right and victori.
Representative but I go now.

Present further are there two
amendments
just one.
Reps
whenever you already.
Thank you mister chair and
committee members sorry we were
in another committee I was in
another committee especially
reps and furry my bad so we we

the first bill to us quite a
while our next bill's house bill
one eighty seven school solar
tax credit observer.
Thank you mr chair i'll go ahead
and would you like me to explain
the amendment first.
Manager
sorry i've been over there for a
long time resident from
I I think the amendment is is
pretty discrete and what won't
you go ahead and present the
bill and then will take public
comment and then we'll move them
and then okay thank you very
much.
Household one eighty seven
is the school solar income tax
credit and the bill is to enable
all the mexico public scores to
go completely solar electric
over the next four years
and at a zero cost to the
schools and to reduce the
electric costs by four times the
amount of the state tax credit
and this bill provides a forty
percent refundable and
transferable tax credit to
companies who install solar on
their school property to provide
solar electricity to the score.
And refundable credit is needed
to get federal taxed equity
funding to invest in the
projects and historically very
few schools have gone all solar
but with the bitencentives and
this incentive all public
schools can participate and it
is expected that seventy percent
of new mexico schools will
convert to complete solar
electricity in the next four
years this is the this is a once
in a forever opportunity for
school to go solar right now.
And the school districts can
issue competitive rfs the
baseline costing came from the
state cess in twenty nineteen oh
seven contract low bidder for
the solar clear energy solar new
mexico let's see who states that
with this new mexico tax credit
they can provide the resources
to build all the solar for all
the new mexico schools to go a
hundred percent solar within
four years at pricing that will
save the schools four times the
amount of the tax credit
and the program caused if the
seventy proof if the seventy
percent of new mexico schools go
solar within four years of this
bill passing
based on this clear energy solar
low bidder prices.
Or equal competitors there will
be two hundred four million
dollars of new mexico tax
credits needed
and there are programs return on
investment is that the forty
percent tax credit means that
two and a half dollars of
private money are required to
get one dollar of new mexico tax
credits and for companies
providing a commitment that
their projects will save the
school district four times that
of the tax credit amount and
this means that the two hundred
and four million dollars of new
mexico tax credits will return
eight hundred sixteen million
dollars of reduced electric
costs in the state.
And the reason this is so urgent
to do this this session is that
the higher federal incentives
are
only
available right now and the
incentives in the inflation
reduction act currently provide
a forty percent federal tax
credit plus accelerated
depreciation benefits which the
public schools cannot directly
use and the higher incentives
have a competitive component
benefit that must be submitted
in april in may of twenty twenty
four so just in a few months and
this level and incentive will
not be available next year and
once approved for the higher
incentives the construction must
be done within four years.
And the rule area scores are
more difficult and expensive to
provide solar projects but
they're currently bonuses that
the solar federal solver
incentives provides
with the extra incentive in role
areas not available in alba
kirky last cruises are santa fe
but such that rule areas will be
able to achieve the same four
times lower electric costs from
the clear energy solar supplier
as a larger cities get to take
advantage of
so there's a value to the school
districts all one hundred and
fifty seven new mexico school
districts can participate and
the savings and average is
sixteen point six million
house district and twenty seven
point seven million per m senate
district and you can see the
summary which I will be glad to
introduce my expert mister
rockie back who
has
extensive experience with
utilities
as it's utilities expert in also
a solar advocate and mister
ribs
the mere irjector so there were
some handouts they were sort of
tucked into the notebooks
like I can see them sticking
other represents cuts not books
so just if you're looking for
these these handouts which I
think
is referencing they are usefully
included in.
Go ahead.
You have to push a button search
to michael now.
Mr chair representatives thank
you for allowing me to speak to
day and and express
some statements on this school
tax credit
they've been concerned expressed
about it i'm sorry I was
distracted could you introduce
yourself again i'm sorry my name
is rocky back in who are you
with
I do consulting work I also have
previously own solar companies
and i've also been i've been a
consultant for the california
public utility for nevada power
and have been a party to the
last several as ten years and
i'll pass electric great cases
over the public healthy
commission to mexico thank you.
The.
So in considering this bill i've
mainly looked at projects that
are currently contracted for
dimming school district and
cobry school district those
contracts would only have loud
about sixty percent of the
schools to go solver because the
people funding this those
projects won't do a project
unless it says at least ten
percent of the electric cost of
the school and so they don't
want to do projects where the
schools are going to pay more
for solar than they would have
to the electorate company with
this bill the diming school
district is an example would be
able to do all of their schools
and the additional four million
that would have been paid in a
tax credit would increase the
savings to twenty five million
dollars over the life of the
project which is now warranted
for thirty years so but makes a
huge difference in the amount in
number of schools that can
participate in the case of no
pass or electric virtually none
of the schools in a parcel
lecture territory will qualify
on a financial nouses in which
they need to save ten percent of
the electric cost without this
bill the reason for that is
because there's a very high.
The man charge in those areas so
if you have some usage at night
when solar is not on you still
pay the demand charge and it can
be the same amount since the
demand charges up to eighty
percent of the total electric
bill without doing a lot of
batteries it does at work.
With batteries you can address
the demand charge the twenty
four hours twenty four seven
usage it becomes much more cost
effective and creator much
greater savings for the school
districts.
Every school district in the
state has been analyzed and
that's part of the fact that
there's table which i'm just
holding up that has every school
district all.
It gets a hundred and fifty
seven school districts to show
the number of students the
number of buildings the
estimated cost for
them to have solder to do it
between ninety two and ninety
seven percent generally of their
total electric costs because we
assume that they will also do
efficiency measures later.
And overall the were the numbers
came from four four hundred and
she's me for two hundred and
four million dollars of tax
credit is because that will be a
seventy percent implementation
over the next four years if
schools get the additional
federal incentives it has to be
completed in four years which is
why we believe they would all be
completed within that time
they're certainly some schools
that for their own various
reasons are not willing to do a
solar project and so we've
estimated based on feedback that
there would be seventy percent
of the schools in new mexico
which would implement and not
all of them if all of them
implemented and if there was
only a forex savings then or
four times savings there would
be one point one billion dollars
of electric savings over the
next twenty years this is be
thirty years at seventy percent
of the eight hundred sixteen
million dollars of savings over
the next thirty years
and that's it after work savings
in the analysis of dimming their
savings would be about six times
what the tax credit would be but
other areas don't have as high
electric usage of these
different variables and so
yesterday for the entire state
is about four x savings based on
the commitment of the cest low
bidder which was clear energy
solar new mexico
it is not restricting a declare
energy new mexico the dimming
and other project are not
through them
and cobra not through them but
what they've said is there a
baseline they're available to
every school district because
the cs numbers they don't have
to go through the expense of
doing an rfp for a small
districtive if they only have.
A hundred students they could
still participate without all
the expense of an RFP but if a
larger school district that can
afford it and has a process
wants to do an rp there
certainly welcome to do that
they're not required to do this
but certainly they would need
them show reason if they pay the
higher price or we're not going
to get savings of why they did
that pick the ces no bidder to
do the work which does provide
that so that's how it would be
done I want to point out if you
if you're looking at this sheet.
Footnote number two is that we
did have a requirement to
initially in the bill for a four
time savings
that requirement was strongly
extremely strongly objected to
by the psfa they felt that it
would be a burden to them to
have to administer those
requirements they stated that no
other solar bills have read to
have a performance requirement
and so we were told that it
would not
legislate of council told his we
had to remove that in order for
the building forward so that's
why that requirement is no
longer in the bill it was in
there and was intended but that
that's why it was removed.
The.
I am thinking I can answer most
questions you may have and i'm
happy to stand answer any
questions anyone may have thank
you very much.
Thank you for that recent ferry
rates to go to the public.
Okay
is there anyone here in the
audience who like speaking
opposition to this bill.
The.
Is there anyone online who would
like to speak in opposition to
his bill please resure.
Um.
We have my t antonio with excel
energy.
The.
Mister den tell you if you know
more than nine years
thank you mr chair members is
committed to still energy we are
leader
deployment throughout our
service area and and our company
we and politicians have any
chance talk to the sponsor bill
sponsored but they're just some
concerns we have to bill
the possibility for confusion
exists with the bill like this
you know what is the real energy
pause mexico we hadn't recently
passed
community solar bill couple
years ago it's just now being
implemented you know they those
community solar projects have
the other eligibility to serve
schools and so this is kind of
the subsequent of that
customers that are served by
solar projects that impact them
out of their integration
community sold projects to you
not have
the amount of customers to serve
you can make their projects
biable some questions we have
it is more of a concern with
that also just a size limitation
I don't see the size limitation
in the bill we went down really
prefer to see something in the
bill that the middle side was
most systems to serve the
existing school on which
grounds they were
constructed on
generally my concern thank you.
Thank you mister de antonio
anyone else in our position
seeing then
everyone in the room who would
like to speak and support.
The.
Let's straight from your seat
and told it should be working.
We are in support of this bill
as we.
Allowing third party to stall
school.
Thank you others.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
Thank you ma'am others.
Yes sir.
Okay so we are getting reports
that we can't hear so
mrperiod bothers if you could
turn them I gone into the but
nobody should start with that
I would relocate
they've seen were reduced
electric costs helped their
budget issues tremendously
but beyond that I mean generally
sorry since schools is genius
side from those financial costs
doing so will help students in
new mexico understand that the
adults in her state are taking
action to help them have a
brighter future climate
psychology alliance in north
america urges states to address
the psychological dimensions of
the climate and ecological
crisis polling shows climate
anxieties especially high and
children and young people and
their beliefs about whether
government is responding
appropriately to reserve a
healthy future has a huge.
Thank you others in the audience
in sports.
Anyone else now will go online
for soft we have your car.
To put you.
Almost afternoon
chairman of a queen members of
the committee my name is
supposedly development
I don't hear today representing
earth care group care is the
community development
organization based on the south
side of the
area and family members work on
issues impacting their lives
from the local to the state
level we were closely with the
public school and help pushed
for the solar relation of
facilities throughout santa fe
as distracted which has been
incredible energy cost savings
things to solidisation we
support this because it will
make it possible for other
school districts throughout the
state to solar either their
facilities using the incredible
incentives available right now
that the sponsors are in expert
when our school store as we see
considerable savings for school
budgets which means more funds
for important school needs of
other kinds we've seen the car
saving benefit for solar first
hand are you random campaign
almost ten years ago to solar it
is on it also which is the
community center where we
operate and we'll see not only
but also
like folks have said an example
set through this policy where
young people can see that there
are tangible actions we can take
to solve the climate crisis
given that the window to act on
climate closing rapidly it's
critical that we transition to
sources whenever possible you
want to think that the funds are
for this bill and for creating
his great incentives for a
school to go solar thank you so
much
thank you next that we have.
Jews you need.
But then I wanted to chairman
any members of the committee my
name is jose in a go and i'm a
spokesperson free yaka use
united for climate crisis our
requirement energy campaign has
thousands of members and
supporters are crossed new
mexico I personally am a member
leader in the premium basement
we support this bill as a common
sense incentive to encourage our
schools to go to solar our
members or young people who are
scared for their future and who
are quite frankly losing hope in
the ability of adult leaders and
the institutions in the ran to
address the climate crisis this
bill is super low hanging for as
a renewable energy bills are to
move us in the right direction
linked to the sponsor and thinks
in an advanced for the committee
for supporting this bill.
Thank you next up.
We have read old christian.
Rendell your muted on your end.
That would help
good morning many members thank
you for allowing me to continue
reading the christian president
of a clear energy solar new
mexico
with the current new medical
state zero one nine seven.
Little bit about we have sold
products in the city new jersey
south carolina north carolina
and investment
we have the financial capability
to install for all schools
over the next four years
the current face is a rocky
match utility
they require a large amount of
batteries as you might as well
and this is quite massive
financially impossible to sport
of solar enspective this is the
case for most courts in the pn
territory and this is more
should be a problem for almost
all yes
and other class.
Our commitment is that only
install solar when we know our
customers can state substantials
not financially feasible
with this bill also become
all stores
practically request they do
today thank you.
Thank you
real
next week on the porter.
Good morning mister chairman and
members of the committing and
thank you for the opportunity to
speak to you today on this
important bill it will reduce
costs in a reduced green demand
eleverage significant federal
funds and it also will advance
our clean energy goals in the
state please fastest bill it's
important to our children it's
important to our future thank
you.
Sorry that's it for public
comment.
Would you like to have anything
before we go to the committee
yes please mister chair mister
baccus would like to respond to
those
at a note about the one case.
Mister chair representatives
I was one of the commentators
and participated in the
community solar program for new
mexico and in response to mister
antonio's question
there's about two hundred but
there's two hundred megawatts of
power limited in the community
solar program there are roughly
three thousand five hundred
megawates of solar required in
order to accompanise energy
transition so the approach me
two hundred and four mega watch
it would be in the solar for
schools that's less than six
percent of the three thousand
five hundred megawatch required
there is an overwhelming
abundance of opportunities for
community solar based on the
limitations it has and in my
opinion I have no impact on
their ability to have customers
a consumers if they are not
using schools as part of the
base for which they're doing it
and so I I think that's not a
concern at all with this bill
thank you
okay.
So
going to the committee of first
we do have a
amendment
with someone like to move the
amendment for discussion
sir second
second okay rivers a ferry could
you explain the moment.
Mister chair I mean that mister
bacchest explained that he was
in talking to the drafter
mister chair representatives the
questions that came up with the
drafter and with some of the
schools that looked it is is it
had the statement of installed
and purchased in the case of
most entities that will do these
projects they're going to
purchase materials are going to
purchase labor and have it done
but they're not going to
purchase complete systems so the
language it said purchase an
install systems created a
conflict which was recommended
to take that out and so
this amendment is to take out it
means it just installs not
installs and purchases which
complicated the later
implementation.
Is there any discussion on the
american
is there any opposition to the
amendment.
Okay the amendment is adopted
now onto the bill for some
realistic representative
thank you sorry
thank you mister chair
representative and mister bakes
thank you
I a few days ago which seemed
like a few hours ago and that
time seems like a few months ago
we heard house bill one o eight
the local solar access find a
bill and and i'm just.
Not entirely clear how this bill
will.
Possibly conflict with or
compliment that bill could you
could you explain that to us a
little better please.
I'm not familiar enough with
household when a week of at my
expertise
mr chair representative hembry
the other bill is I recall is a
hundred and ten million dollar
bill to set up a find which
within later allow applications
to that fund which would then
allow projects to be done which
could be ministerable could also
be schools but.
That is a
it is not a conflict in that
schools can be separated and
they can be done soon they won't
miss the additional federal
incentives a program that has to
have applications after a fund
set up is not going to get done
in the next few months so that's
the reason why this bill is it's
fundamentally faster and well
create transition faster.
The other difference is that if
you wanted to have all of the
municipal buildings in the state
done I did until the industrials
are not enough to do that and so
there's not a conflict in what
it allows to be done so
municipal buildings can be done
for whichever groups want to and
schools across the state can be
done but they do not conflict
with one another from a funding
or the other building of
projects
thank you mister bocke's mr
chair
representative
and mister barkes.
So
it sounds like what could happen
but as you said it it may not be
practical because of the timing
but a school could apply
for the local solar access fund
to help.
Pay for this and then the
installer gets the.
Tax credit is that correct.
Under under this bill I am
confused at how all this works
together i'm i'm and and because
of that confusion I may not be
articulating my question quite
as.
As as well as I should buries
I guess first.
Who gets the tax credit.
Is that the contractor.
I'm so i'm just trying to follow
the corner of mister chair and
and represent if I want to make
sure that i'm allowed to answer
not getting out of order.
There are multiple ways it can
be done my belief is that almost
all of it will be done but sweet
through what is called purchase
power agreements so a entity
such as clear energy new mexico
would fund the project to have a
contractor install everything
based on having a contract with
the with the school only for the
school to buy electricity from
them so the school would only
buy electricity at a significant
lower price and they would
otherwise pay the school would
pay nothing else in terms of
insurance
maintenance etc the separate
energy would own the system and
just sell the school the
electricity because the separate
entity owns the solar they get
the federal tax credit they get
the state tax credit they get to
depreciate the system and that
brings the cost round
dramatically versus any other
way of doing solar at this time.
Thank you mister barcus mr
chairman representative ferrari
and mister baucus so.
What is the
potential
liability.
Four.
An entity not related to a
school or a school discrete
owning
property.
At the school.
Mister chair representative
himbury sorry
the entity owns the solar
equipment at the facility they
do not own the property the land
or any of the school property
their school is not deeding over
any property it's just allowing
it to be put out their property
so it's similar to anything else
at the school made lease or buy
the entity that is selling the
equipment and or maintaining it
is responsible for the insurance
to make sure there's insurance
for anything that may happen
everything is done with
licensees permits inspections
in most areas for example there
has to be a hundred and five
mile per hour win certification
a little handle that without an
issue and other standard
construction processes such as
is used for all school
construction or leased equipment
that may be on a squill side
okay thank you mister bakis
mister chair
representative ferrari and I
apologize if I miss pronouncing
it
by I understand and it is
himberry you have been saying it
correctly apparently represented
on toyota tells me that armbray
is also acceptable but
so if I understand correctly the
the federal funds available that
this is
designed to help spur because
it's essentially can be.
Because the combination of this
along with the federal phones
but that federal program sunsets
in four years is that correct.
Mister chair embry no sir the
federal phones
have first several different
categories and have different
requirements the.
Without drawing out too long at
their six percent base that
there's an additional goes up to
thirty percent if you meet
requirements for training and
for.
Wage levels there's an
additional amount for being in
an energy zone which santa fe
albequer key and stras crucials
are not most of the rest of
stadius there's an additional
amount for using domestic
content there's additional
amount for low income
certification the department of
energy is administering a
program to allocate the low
income allocation which is a
higher level of incentive but
that's a competitive nationwide
competitive analysis so schools
have to have basically
contracted with someone to do a
project they chat to say
nebulously were low income they
have to say here's how much and
here's what we want to do and
then they have a competition for
that both diming school district
and cobra school district have
already submitted for that
program under the twenty twenty
three under the twenty twenty
four which is expected to be
better mapro may those have to
be submitted so schools that
want to do this need to get on
board and I can assure you that
all of them are being contacted
to
make that available but
it doesn't sunset the program
it's just that there's expected
to be way over allocation for it
so it's it's that that it's
ending it's that if it gets
allocated you don't have a chart
a shot excuse me thank you
mister barcus but that for
clarifying that so mister chair
representative mister bakis
so it is that
there is essentially a race
going on for the allocated funds
that
because there's only so much
there okay thank you that kind
of.
Helps me develop these other
question and so.
How many schools in new mexico
sorry mr chair.
Mr chair
representative ferrari and and
mister barcus how many schools
in new mexico can realistically
get this done and for you.
Mister chair representative
do I say it wrong you're it's
right
now you're thinking about it
I know i'm sorry
the.
Work can all be done for all
schools in new mexico within
four years because this is
contracted work this is not the
schools having to develop it
everything from the engineering
to the permitting to the actual
installation acquisition of
equipment etc is a standard
process as compared to the
amount of solar being stalled
each year the united states this
is a small fraction well under
five percent would be my general
gas and so the capacity to do
the installations is there as
the representative from clean
clear energy stated they have
the funds to to do it now it's
just a matter of having it be
financially feasible which this
bill would feel that last piece
thank you mister backer back us
now I now i'm doing it
personally
it's normally plants back is
played back okay sorry sorry
but like the that would have
been them the roman god was
barclays right now nicest would
have been greek okay I apologize
mister battles though you're
correct
mr chair of representative
ferrari and mister back is
so this response has an
aggregate cap of two hundred
four million dollars but no
yearly cab.
Again they're kind of i've
guessed creating some sort of
urgency or a race between
schools to get this done
I mean.
Ha
it seems that that in that race.
Larger cities
with more contractors available
to do this would benefit.
More than rural school districts
where it may take more time to
get this done
and so it seems to give to me at
least because there's not a
yearly cap that the first year
I mean this could all be gone
to the albuquerque school
district
and that seems to me to to give
a benefit to larger cities over
smaller rural districts could
you address that please mister
chairman brief
the opposite has been my
experience thus far the smaller
school districts are able to get
consensus among their personnel
amongst their construction
people amongst their building
facilities people and make a
much faster decision in the case
of uh cobra school district they
made their decision within two
weeks in the case of last
christopher school district
which we've been working with
for a while I think getting a
decision just to do something is
going to take months in terms of
the size and the money
allocations if you look at the
table that was handed out
all the turkey search certainly
is the largest school district
and i'm looking okay out of
turkey schools would be seventy
five million dollars out of two
hundred million dollars so that
is the largest peace but the
funds are there for seventy
percent of schools to get this
done I don't believe there's a
significant advantage to the
larger districts and in terms of
speed of making the applications
I would assure you that my
belief is strongly that the
small school district will all
be in there first okay thank you
mr chairman representative for
our eight and mister bacus so
if what I have heard is correct
that you think all the schools
in the state of new mexico can
realistically get this done in
four years.
And the funding is therefore
seventy percent of the schools
someone's getting left out
correct
mr chairman's robbery there are
school districts people
individuals that have political
or other views that they do not
like solar and so those did have
expressed that too as we believe
will not know it no matter how
much is paid for it they don't
want to do that because it's not
their political view and so we
believe that seventy percent
allows for every school that
wants to do this to do it and
does not.
Ask more money that would then
be tied up for a period of time
then what is needed for those
that who will actually do it
thank you thank you mister
baccus and one final question
mister chair representative
rural and
mr baccus.
All the schools that want to.
Can get this done in four years
and the sort of federal
incentives well be expanded in
four years why does this not
sunset until two thousand thirty
si.
Mister chair representative the
sun said date was to parallel
what's been done in some other
solar bills and for concern with
folks that they didn't want to
have it overly rushed
I believe it does not lead to
being that long but I don't
think it hurts anything for it
to be that long the experience
with past solar bills is that
they've had sunsets long be
young when they actually ran out
of funds and so it's similar to
what's been done in prior solar
bills in that it doesn't hurt to
have a extra time if you don't
need it but if something was
tighter some school districts
have got a waiver or whatever it
wouldn't require another action
of the legislature
thank you very much mister
representative I appreciate the
time mr chairman thank you reps
and brigade
thank you mister chair
representative ferrari guess
thank you mr marcus yes
so I have a question and I don't
see it in any of the information
that was provided
so my understanding is these
companies would put the solar
panels on the roughs of the
schools and the schools and
then.
The tax credit I guess could you
sold or bought.
I'm not sure about that to
someone else that wants to so I
I support the concept
but I have a fundamental
question about anti donation so
is there an agreement with the
square system
each respective school system a
lease agreement
so that there is not an anti
donation issue
because
my understanding
against and maybe i'm wrong is
that
the respective company would be
profiting in terms of a tax
credit is that that would then
be sold to someone my
understanding that correctly or
how how does that
you know i'm still confused
about that mister chair and
representative berego
the
solar panels will not be on the
school because of them the
liability and different things
for the roofing and structure
would have to go through a lot
of process they will be free
standing but on the rest of your
concerns I mean it refer to my
expert mister back is
mrperiod chair ripped in berigo
if I produce it right now
i'm not an attorney that could
give you the answer on the anti
donation cause but in terms of
your question about how is it
processed with the schools
every meter will have a separate
contract not just a school
district so every meter will
have a separate contract because
buildings get torn down they
don't lose everything at one
time things get moved whatever
so every meter will be
separately contracted for and
there is a complete contract for
the life of the system including
removal of the solar system at
the end of the term of the
agreement all of that is
included in all the financial
masses and commitments.
That are done so
there are separate contracts
they do get a substantial
reduction in the prices that
have already been committed to
based on this bill being passed
out so exactly how that
interacts with the interdonation
clause i'd have to refer to your
attorneys and i'm sure they're
service
their home mister chairman and
and representative ferrari I
want to support this because I
think it encourages
you know solar and solar credits
and so on but I do have that
fundamental question about you
know if there is a private.
Company that is
essentially using the property
of a score
it I mean there is a fundamental
question unless there's some
sort of lease agreement
that has been established with
the school board
is if there if the company is
paying the score a certain
amount then it's a legitimate
lease agreement but there is a
profit margin that is
essentially been
you know
I guess
gained by the private company
I mean how does that work and
III need to have the answer to
that in order to make a really
respectful decision
is there an anti donation
you know are we violating anti
donation and and i've done a lot
of work in lease agreements with
regard to telecommunications
when I worked for the city of
albuquerque and you know there
were
many many
including pn who leased to
telecommunication companies to
put their antannas you know when
there was an exchange of of
funding.
But I don't want to put the
school systems in a position
where we are violating anti
donation and I not have that
answer I don't see it anywhere
in this information.
And so I have more questions
than I have answers right now
thank you i'd like to refer to
mr baccus mister chair represent
brego.
The schools don't release the
equipment to have a purchase
power agreement contract so like
with the utilities that they're
buying electricity from now
they're only paying for
electricity they are paying us a
price for electricity that is
significantly less than they
would have paid to the utility
for the same amount of
electricity
the
issue of leasing space to them
has been determined on all the
months i've looked at this far
to be insignificant the reason
for that is that when you put a
cover over a parking lot and you
have zero loss of parking
capability there is no real.
Item that the school is giving
to the
people that are doing the solder
so this these are not being
installed on ruce on either ones
we've looked at thus far and I
think they probably won't be any
because i've heard a lot of
concerns from school districts
about roof issues but in terms
of leasing the space when you're
talking
literally a four by four space
on the line where the party
light is for people we're not
supposed to park on the line
anyway there's nothing being
donated and there's a part of
the contracts on every contract
i've looked at and he's again
purchases of the electricity
contracts at the end of the term
they're required to remove all
the equipment
and so
I can't see anything that anyone
would say is a donation to the
companies they're just selling a
little electricity to lower
price and took some extent
there's a benefit for the school
districts have covered parking
as an added benefit to them not
in any way and attraction to
them.
And representative
mister marcus
so.
The company comes in and and the
score sister school board or
whoever
agrees to this this sum.
Basically I don't know how what
what to refer to it as this
business transaction
these school system basically
says you've got four by five i'm
just saying hypothetical for by
five area that you can put these
these panels in right
and the company who is a
privately owned business comes
in and place of those on there
on the on the school property
there has to be some sort of a
lease agreement between the
school system and this company
and there is some sort of a
benefit to that company at some
level and that's what my
question is is that an anti
donation and I there's a bunch
of attorneys in here maybe I
should be asking you know I I
don't know I don't have the
answe.
Because that company is
essentially benefiting at some
level from placing those
those solar panels on that
school property.
Mr chair representative I think
we can my expert can explain a
little further.
Mister charles and brigo.
If you thought of a purchase
power agreement as being very
much like a lease I mean their
typically thirty pages or so
they cover a merion of issues
from liability to cleaning trash
etc etc and in those agreements
like a lease would be there
being given the right to have
the space used but it's been.
Evaluated as being.
A benefit to the school matt
something the school is giving
up to have covered parking so
most people refer to these its
carports very nice car ports but
still carports and so
the idea that the company is
somehow.
Benefiting from that is
not a separate consideration
because the only place they can
sell the electricity as to the
school itself they're not
allowed to sell it so place else
it's what's called net metering
is behind the meter on each of
these meters and so that's part
of the inner connection process
of deteriors have had for a long
time it's it's facilitating net
metering it's not creating a new
situation it's not like
community solar where they may
have a.
Fifty acre project somewhere in
and have transmission lines
coming in and so.
From a practical and basic.
Look I can't see how there's a
donation of anything by the
school over time if the school
decides at the end of the
agreement term we don't want
this to have to restore it to
what it was before so
did the school by allowing
solder to be above their parking
places give up anything no if
they if the school decides to
have it moved later they can
request it to be moved all of
those are standard parts of
these contracts.
Thank you for that explanation
and mister chair I think in the
next committee may be maybe some
of these questions should be
addressed but it seems to me
like if there was some sort of
because there is still a private
company involved
it seems to me like there should
be some sort of a lease
agreement even if it's just for
a dollar or something to get
around that question I think
that is of a fundamental
question that needs to be
answered before you know and
maybe not in this committee but
in the next committee
that
if the school
system
entered into this agreement that
you mentioned then there should
still be some sort of financial
agreement that
avoids any even appearance of in
propriety of a for that private
company so I think that's
something representative that I
would take a look at as this
moves forward I mean I I want to
encourage this sort of you know
dynamic because I think it's
it's it benefits what we're
trying to do in terms of
creating you know clean energy
but I also have some fundamental
questions about those
contractual agreements and how
they're structured so without
mister chair i'm just gonna
leave it at that and I hope that
in the next committee those
questions can be answered
thank you very
this committee he's been at this
for about three and a half hours
i'm getting requests for a break
reps for you with the okay with
you if we took about ten minute
break thank you mister chair so
what will just pause would
probably turn off the the.
The webcast we're we're gonna
take ten minute break in the
morning back.
