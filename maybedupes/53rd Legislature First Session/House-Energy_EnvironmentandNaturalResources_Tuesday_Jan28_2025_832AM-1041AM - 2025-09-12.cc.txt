Present.
Representative Dixon.
Representative Garcia.
And then
Representative Grola, here.
Representative Henry.
Representative Montoya.
Here
Representative Murphy.
Here
that works, that works.
Representative Small.
Representative Small.
Representative Serana.
Chair McQueen.
Do we have a quorum? We have.
OK, thank you.
It
OK, so we're, we're gonna do a
little housekeeping um before we
get started. Uh, first off,
Um
Nina, our committee assistant,
would you like to introduce
yourself?
My name's Nina Reggio. I'm the
committee assistant for House
Energy and Natural Resources.
So she, as you may recall, is
that sick at our organizational
meeting, so we're glad to have
you back.
Um
Uh, first off, uh, just to check
in, especially with the ranking
member, uh, we put out an
agenda.
Uh, and then there was a request
by the sponsor of those bills
to, to move those around and so
we put out a revised agenda.
And that's
That happens, um.
I think everyone got to know
this is that is everything
working smoothly?
Yes, the amendment so.
OK.
Yeah, so we're, we're working on
the amendments, um, so we do
have we
We have a 24 hour rule, um, and
we're also, uh, I haven't
checked but the amendments
should be posted online as well.
So they're available to the
public?
Um, so we're still, yeah,
working out the kinks.
Um
Uh, we do have an email
distribution list that we send
out to uh the committee. If
anyone would like to be on the
distribution list.
To receive notices about agenda
items and things like that.
Uh, you're welcome to give your
email address to Nina, and she
can add you to that list.
Um
We do have a committee dinner,
uh, coming up, um, uh, for the
committee and staff.
Um, and our sponsors, uh, did we
pick a date for that?
So that's gonna be February
10th. Do we pick a location?
He the Cafe.
Uh, so you'll get notices about
that, um.
February 10th at Coyote Cafe.
So put that on your calendar
now, um.
That's usually a, that's usually
a nice dinner.
Um, and then, uh, we have some
musical chairs, so we had a
little bit of musical chairs
when we came in this morning,
um, uh, we have more throughout
the course of today's hearing.
So, uh, I have a bill up in um
Uh, another committee?
Uh, so I'm gonna present that
and uh vice Chaarano is going to
chair.
Uh, and then vice chairarana has
a bill up.
Um, and looks like uh
representative Garcia, Isabella,
um, so I think there, there's
just gonna be some in and out
today.
Um, if anyone else, uh, has
anything, uh, let me know as we
discussed at the last meeting.
Um, you know, if, if we're
missing people that we think are
going to affect the outcome of
the vote, uh, we will hold the
vote open and try to attract
those people now.
Uh, any
Questions or announcements from
the committee.
OK.
So, um, uh, our first bill is uh
representing block, and I'm just
gonna excuse myself and let uh I
share.
Sorry now take over.
Mr. Black, whenever you want,
you're ready to go ahead and
introduce yourself, do you have
any experts?
Thank you, Madam Chairman. I
don't, I guess I will be,
there you go.
Everyone, good to meet you. I, I
don't think I've met all the
members here in this committee.
So good to meet everyone. uh
Representative John Block from
House District 51 in Alamogordo.
So good to see everybody here.
And so I guess, I guess I'll
just start with the bill
introduction, first, you have an
amendment. Do you have an
amendment? I do have an
amendment up.
OK.
I
One moment, Madam Chairman.
the
3
0031.
1. I hope that's what you all
have.
Um, and, um, yes, I'm sorry, go
ahead.
Madam Chair, I moved I move the
amendment for discussion.
Thank you.
So I don't know if you read
that.
Right. Um
The movement, the amendment has
been moved and seconded, so go
ahead. Representative Block,
explain your amendment.
Thank you, Madam Chairman. So
pretty much this amendment is,
like I said, it's clean up from
legislative council. It's just
changing, I believe.
Fund
On page 1 line 14, and then
through sections 6 to 10.
It's pretty much reformatting
the.
The way that this tax code is
written here, so it's pretty
much just a clean up. I don't
think this was done.
Previously, in the previous bill
that was your for this committee
in 2024, I believe. So that's
pretty much what this amendment
does, nothing structural, Madam
Chairman.
Right.
Sure, I move a pass.
Do we have any objections to the
amendment, right, right, you
passed by a representative of.
To you,
no, on amendment.
This is the beginning.
OK.
If there are no objections, then
we um have an amended.
Amendment is adopted.
All right, Mr. Black.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair and
thank you all again. So
not to make you guys go deaf
with this microphone, sorry. I
learned that from Representative
Murphy this morning,
so
this legislation is actually
modeled after a 2020 bill from
Senator Padilla and now Senator
Trujillo, both a Democratic
members of the Senate, and this
bill essentially
puts an excise tax. It's not a
severance tax. I want to make
that very clear. This is not a
severance tax on renewables. It
is merely an excise tax of 3.3
or 3.75.
So this tax would just be on par
with what we collect currently
with oil and gas in the city New
Mexico.
And as New Mexico continues to
transition in our energy sector
and continues to move toward our
very ambitious goals.
Or
Budget really needs to be more
diversified.
And so when it comes to
diversification of our budget.
We need to see about where we
can.
Harness the potential of New
Mexico when it comes to our
energy sector. We have all the
sunshine in the world, Madam
Chairman. We have great wind. I
always pass all the, all the
wind farms whenever I come up to
Santa Fe. So I see the good work
that is happening in the state.
And so this is a way to have
buy-in from industries to help
grow our, our communities and
grow our state through
production of tax. So I won't be
very lengthy, Madam Chairman,
but that's pretty much what the
bill does, and I'd be happy to
address questions, but I'm
will go to comments and I I look
forward to that. So thank you,
Madam Chairman.
All right, we're gonna start out
going to the audience. Um,
Raise your hand if you are in
support of the bill.
Um,
we are gonna only take 2 minutes
for opposition, 2 minutes
apiece, or about 10 minutes,
right? So let's go ahead and
start on this side. You'll stand
up.
A re
And then, and try not to
duplicate your remarks if
possible.
Chair.
committee members. This is very
spotty.
My name's Athena Christodoulou,
and I'm an energy and
environmental engineer. I oppose
this bill because again, I don't
want to belabor the point. We
are uh charging the baby that
we're developing, which is
renewable energy. I do think
that at some point, the state
should consider a ma levy on
exported electricity, but that's
for future. Thank you.
Good morning.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Melissa Bernardin. I'm
here representing the Sierra
Club Rio Grande chapter in our
35,000 members and supporters.
We're here in opposition to HB
45, which is a tax on New Mexico
renewable energy that will slow
our state's ability to lead a
clean energy transition,
renewable energy companies
already pay gross receipts tax,
corporate income tax, personal
income tax on payroll.
Land lease payment and property
tax. New Mexico has some of the
best renewable energy resources
in the nation, and a renewable
energy tax will slow our energy,
new renewable energy develop in
our state and slow, most
importantly, slowing our ability
to fight climate change. Thank
you.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, Rickie
Lee Chavez on behalf of the
Inner West Energy Alliance for
the sake of our new members in
our inner West Energy Alliance
is a multi-state trade or uh
association that represents
utility scale renewable
development, um, across the
Southwest and specifically here
in New Mexico with um all due
respect to the sponsor and his
dedication to the state, we do
respectfully oppose this piece
of legislation. Um, I believe
that the previous speaker
covered the majority of.
our points, um, but we would
just, uh, reiterate for the
committee that renewable energy
projects here in New Mexico do
play gross receipts tax,
corporate income tax, um,
property tax, and if um we're,
we're given this opportunity to
stay within the status quo, um,
we can continue to uh be
competitively priced and and
compete for renewable
development in the Southwest,
and so we respectfully oppose
and encourage you to do the
same. Thank you.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
committee members. My name is
Mariel Nanasi and I represent
new energy economy. We stand um
in opposition to this
legislation, we need a time
where we're incentivizing
renewable energy, supporting
grid stability, um, and limiting
public cost and unfortunately,
we believe this is, this bill
would hinder that. Thank you.
Good morning, uh, Madam Chair
and members of the committee. My
name is Marco Gonzalez and I am
the richer lobbyist for
MMEnergy, which is building a
400 mile transmission line from
Union County to San Juan County,
um, and capturing, um, some of
the most best win in the
country, uh, where there is no
actually development at this
point. And I also represent
pattern energy, uh, which is
building the largest renewable
energy project anywhere in the
Western Hemisphere in Little
Duran and Encino, New Mexico.
So, uh, for all the reasons that
have been previously mentioned,
we oppose a bill.
uh, respectfully, uh, uh.
Appreciative of the uh
The the sponsor and I did talk
to him this morning about having
to oppose it respectfully. And
so we ask that you oppose the
bill. Thank you very much, Madam
Chair and.
Thank you, Madam Chairman, uh,
Madam Chair, my name is Jason
Thompson. I'm a registered
lobbyist for Conservation voters
in Mexico. Um, there's been a
lot of previous points stated
and I won't belabor that and uh
with due respect to the sponsor,
I didn't get a chance to come in
this morning and check in with
you and that and talk to you,
but you will respectively uh
oppose this bill as well.
To the other points that were
stated, the only one I would
mention if it hasn't been
mentioned yet, was that they
believe that it potentially
limit smaller companies to be
able to compete with larger
companies in terms of
competitive advantage. So with
that point and all the points
previously stated we
respectfully sta in opposition.
Thank you.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Jim Desjardin, the
executive director of the
renewable Energy Industries
Association of New Mexico.
We've been around since 2004 and
about 60 plus members. New
Mexico is blessed to have an
abundance of renewable energy
resources, and we're well
positioned to take advantage of
them, huge investments are
already being made currently
that have been referenced these
uh projects are providing jobs,
economic development throughout
the state, as already been
mentioned, there's a lot of
taxes already being paid on
these projects, and we believe
right now to implement an
additional tax will be premature
and
and
would not be in the best
interest of the economic
interests of the state. So we
urge you to oppose the
legislation. Thank you.
Good morning Representatives. My
name is Glenn Weichel. I'm the
democratizing energy lead for
3rd act, New Mexico.
A, New Mexico is made up
entirely of volunteers, elders
who care deeply about
environmental justice, and we
urge you to vote no on this
bill. Thank you.
Great. Um, next we're going to
go online, um, if you are in
support of this bill, please
raise your hand.
Mr. Stone, we're gonna start
with you.
Mr. Stone, go ahead.
Right.
Mexico is legally committed to a
rapid energy transition through
the ETA and this bill will slow
the transitioning by hurting the
economics of renewables.
Which have already taken a hit
with the IRA in limbo and
proposed tariffs.
My second point is,
Have y'all been down to the
Permian Basin or up to the San
Juan lately?
So many of the oil wells and
compressors there are powered by
solar energy.
So even the oil and gas industry
understands the importance of
solar.
For low-cost electricity.
Please reject HB 45.
Thank you.
Um, before we continue, is, is
there anyone in opposition? If
you're in opposition, please
raise your hand.
All right. So everyone else is
for the bill. So we'll give you
one minute. We're gonna go for
about.
5 minutes. Thank you.
No, 10 minutes. We'll go 10
minutes. Thank you.
Um, next will be, um, Carrie,
Carrie Brunner.
Here online we're just having a
few technical technical
difficulties. We'll be getting
up soon.
Carrie, can you unmute yourself?
All right, we're gonna go ahead
and go on. We go.
Um, do you need logston?
All right, we're gonna go ahead
and go on.
Jeanie, could you go ahead and
um start your marks.
Um, do you need Loxton?
Is good morning.
we go to the next May, may I
speak, please?
Yes, you may.
Uh, if, if I am, uh, able to uh
make this statement. I would
like to do so um start your
marks. Yes, I will. Thank you. I
think there is a delay in the um
on the um
Technology, so I hope this is
not a problem. I uh would like
to speak as a member of the
League of Women Voters New
Mexico in opposition to this
bill, the renewable Energy
Production Tax Act.
Yes.
Can you hear me? Yes, good
morning.
May, may I speak please?
Yes, you may.
Uh, if, if I am, uh, able to uh
make this statement. I would
like to do so.
your marks? Yes, I will. Thank
you. I think there is a delay in
the um the um
Technology, so I hope this is
not a problem. I uh would like
to speak as a member of the
League of Women Voters New
Mexico in opposition to this
bill, the renewable Energy
Production Tax Act.
Yes.
Can you hear me? Yes, good
morning.
going
It was like May, may I speak
please?
Yes, you may.
Uh, if, if I am um able to uh
make this statement. I would
like to do so.
remarks? Yes, I will. Thank you.
I think there is a delay in the
um the uh
Technology, so I hope this is
not a problem. I, uh, would like
to speak as a member of the
League of Women Voters New
Mexico in opposition to this
bill, the renewable energy
production Tax Act,
Madam Chair, I, I,
I would like to 3 times.
Yeah.
I think there is a delay.
And the um.
ology So this is not a problem.
Which is
All right, we're having too much
trouble with technology, so
hopefully they get it fixed, but
we're going to go ahead and um
come to committee, go to
committee. Our first anyone have
questions? Raise your hand and
um.
My first question is
Representative Cortez.
Good morning everybody, Madam
Chair Representative block, and
members of the community. I'm so
grateful that you all showed up
and whether you are in support
or in opposition of the bill,
that is part of the beautiful
democratic process, so thank you
for showing up to have this
meaningful deliberation with us.
Um, I'd like to share some
comments before I ask my
questions, and I believe that
this will really set the stage
for this committee meeting
today. Um, I believe that
Our experiences shape the lenses
in which we look through. And
you can just nod your head if
you agree with me.
We can all agree on that, on
that whether we're Democrat or
Republican, the things we have
been through in our life shape
our lenses. Um, I represent the
beautiful people of district 62.
I live in the heart of oil
country and I'm the voice of the
hardworking men and women who
worked tirelessly in the oil and
gas industry. And in the oil and
gas industry, and it contributed
49% of the state's budget.
And I'm from Lee County, New
Mexico's largest oil producing
counties and I believe in
diversified energy, but not in
one in place of the other,
meaning diversified energy in
addition to oil and gas, not in
place of oil and gas. And being
a double, a double minority. I
am Hispanic and female, I
believe in equitable
opportunities, not equitable
results. And I'm gonna say that
again.
I believe in equitable
opportunities, not equitable
results, and I, I do not believe
it's OK to create winners and
losers by giving one energy
sector, a competitive advantage
over the other. And I do believe
that it's important to level out
the playing field, which I
believe this bill does to just
to create a attacks just like
the oil and gas tax. Now, Madam
Chair and Representative Block,
I don't believe you.
expounded enough and I would
like to give you the opportunity
to do so. So my first question,
Madam Chair Representative Block
is why not wait until renewable
energy is more established
before imposing a tax.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you so much,
Representative and uh I
apologize I said Madam Chairman
before, and I guess we're
saying, Madam Chair, so I just
want to clarify that, Madam
Chair, thank you. So,
I, I completely.
I think that kind of.
Argument is is one that could be
made, right?
But I look at sectors like the
oil and gas industry in New
Mexico.
And so when I look at the
history.
Of oil and gas, we first struck
gold, oil.
In 1922 in this state.
The state began taxing oil and
gas. By 1933.
This industry that we're talking
about today.
Which is renewables.
Have only been on the large
scale in the state of New Mexico
since the early 2000s.
So right now is around the same
time.
In my opinion,
That we texted oil and gas, and
I think it's a good time for him
to start, especially as our
state is looking to transition
to net zero by 20, I think it's
2035, we have a very ambitious
goal for 50%, I think 2050 is
100% if I'm not mistaken, and
our state is a lot.
More advanced when it comes to
those goals. So for example, in
our neighboring states, I have
a, it's from Rita, the renewable
Energy Transmission Authority,
they give a report every year to
the Finance Authority Committee,
which oversees the finance
authority. And so in Arizona,
they have a 15% goal by 2025.
Colorado has a 30% goal by 2020
and 100% by 2040.
And we have 100% by 2045, so our
neighboring states, some of them
like Utah, have a 20% by 2025.
That's right now.
We have far more ambitious
goals.
And that means that if we're
going to be transitioning off of
energy that is produced from oil
and gas and coal, for example,
then we need to replace at least
some of that revenue.
With what we're replacing it
with.
And so I think it's equitable, I
think it's fair. And as you've
seen probably in your fiscal
impact report, it's not really
going to amount to much of the
budget.
Right, so if there's an argument
that's out there that says, OK,
this is going to cripple our
industry, we're brand new, which
they're not. They've been here
since the early 2000s. I was
born in '97, if that gives you
context.
They've been here since I was.
5 years old.
Essentially, right? So the thing
is large scale, it needs to
finally be on the tax structure,
not only so that they can have
equal tax with oil and gas, but
Madam Chairman, in my opinion.
They should be contributing to
the, to the schools.
To the healthcare system that we
have.
Much of the severance tax that
we collect goes directly as a.
Investment in our communities
back into schools and roads and
police vehicles and fire
stations, and I think if, if
this industry.
wants to show the state that
they're here for the long term.
Then they will make those
commitments in this way, Madam
Chair. Madam Chair
Representative Block, I have
another question if that's OK.
So, what I'm understanding is,
isn't most of the revenue out of
state, meaning the tax.
would also be coming out of
state.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you for that. I, I
completely agree with you. Uh, I
believe about 50% of all
renewable energy from wind and
solar.
Is
Going out of state through
transmission lines, mostly to
Arizona and California.
So there's in the FIR I would
love to address this, by the
way, in the FIR says, oh, New
Mexicans will be saddled with 3
to $4 extra energy costs, and it
will plunge people further into
poverty.
Right, which I don't believe is
very objective stance, but, but
I think if we're looking at
who's buying our energy, a
majority of those taxes will not
go to the everyday consumer.
It's going to go to California
and Arizona. So Madam Chair
Representative Block.
Why are New Mexicans so upset
about taxing California if it's
not coming out of your pocket.
I would, I would love to speak
for other folks, but I will not,
I will say, uh, Madam Chair and
Representative that New Mexico
has very ambitious goals, as I
stated, but we also have a very
poor populace. Our populists, we
have the lowest income per
capita.
In the entire country.
So our our citizens.
They rely
Unfortunately, in my opinion,
on, on many government programs.
And I think it would be a good
opportunity to show.
Our people who work so hard in
our state, like in the oil patch
like in your district that there
is opportunity for them because
we hear all the time, we want
to, we don't want to take away
jobs, we want to replace those
jobs with solar or wind.
OK, well, let's replace them.
But what do we replacing the
schools that they go to in the
budget where we getting the $45
billion that goes to the PED
every year. Where are we getting
that if we go to 2050, 100% ETA
standards, right? I didn't pass
the bill. I'm just trying to
alleviate some of the strain on
the bill, madam Chair. So I also
have a lot of other really good.
Ideas on how to build our
budget, such as legalizing
online sports betting, right?
Maybe we need more, more
revenues from different sources,
and I'm not trying to pick on
industries. I'm just saying, OK,
you've been in the state for
over 2 decades. You have $10
billion projects you're
investing in New Mexico.
By by everybody collectively
giving 3.75% of that revenue.
If that bankrupts your industry?
Then is that really a sturdy
industry that is going to last
the test of time, right.
Thank you so much for
elaborating, uh, Madam Chair and
Representative Block, and I do
want to make a point to so many
struggling New Mexicans, think
about your bottom line, think
about all of the increases that
you have paid, you know, with
inflation, which we know is a
federal issue, you know, with
all of these other increases,
money could be generated into
our state at the expense of
California and so I think Madam
Chair.
Would, um, re-evaluate if people
are now in favor of the bill
that you would have a chance to
talk, um, we just want to make
that available to you, Madam
Chair and Representative Blot,
um, moving forward, I do have
one more question.
What alternatives were
considered in this process.
Sure. Thank you, Madam Chair,
and thank you for that
representative. So many
alternatives I've looked at.
But I thought, why reinvent the
wheel?
This bill was brought forward by
2 Democratic members of the
Senate back in 2020 to actually
fund the early childhood.
Trust fund which we funded in a
different way, right? So, Madam
Chair, I think this idea is a
great idea because it puts them
on par with the same industries
that we're already taxing. It
doesn't choose winners and
losers, and like I said earlier,
we have so many alternatives
that we could bring forward as
revenue streams. The state of
New Mexico a few years ago
decided to tax uh cannabis,
right? That is bringing money,
dollars into industries in local
communities. We're also looking
at other expanding places that
we wanna, we wanna build
industry like right now, it's
not equitable with nuclear, for
example, because we don't have a
nuclear power plant in New
Mexico, right? I would love one,
by the way, but we don't have
one. So what we are doing is
we're using the tools that we
have at our disposal with oil
and gas. We see what's working.
We see what's bringing in
revenue. We also see what is not
necessarily bringing in revenue
because we see industries like
the oil and gas industry, they
pay all those taxes that were
just mentioned.
by many individuals today, they
pay property taxes they pay
payroll taxes they pay GRT.
Everybody does. Every small
business does, so why are we
giving super opportunity to one
industry that is.
A multibillion dollar industry
in the state already. Why are we
giving them an upper hand, and I
hear it's a baby industry. It's
been around for 25 years, 2030
years, I guess I'm a baby too if
that if that counts, but, you
know, I'll do what I do, so
thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair
and Representative Block, and
thank you everyone for giving me
a chance to ask questions to
represent my district, District
62, the hardworking men and
women in the oil and gas
industry and to bring equity in
the policy that we bring to New
Mexico. Thank you so much.
you next is representative
Small.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative Buck.
Uh, first, um,
The
We're sort of told roughly
there's uh between 4 and 5000
jobs in clean energy in New
Mexico right now. Would you
agree with that?
Thank you, Madam Chair, and I, I
would actually say there's
probably even more in the future
that are growing as well. That's
great.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you. And would you agree that uh
it's probably good for us as a
state to look at what other
states have done, uh, and to
sort of learn from that example,
right? Maybe we learned from
Texas' example. Maybe we learned
from Arizona. We look at other
states what they've done. Would
you agree?
Thank you, Madam Chair, and I
would certainly agree. Was that
a yes or no question? Because I,
I would be so happy to give you
those states that are also doing
tax was a question about should
we, should we follow other
states? And so Madam Chair,
representative block, the state
that I'm thinking of actually is
Wyoming.
Wyoming, some of the best, uh,
wind resources in the country
located not as well when it is,
is New Mexico to serve both
internal and external needs, but
they chose to do this, uh, same
approach, going from uh that
local tax structure and Madam
Chair, represent Blan, would you
agree that lessee payments, so
if you have deeded land, a wind
turbine goes up on your uh land
that
Uh, landowner gets payments.
Would you agree or not?
Thank you, Madam Chair, I would
agree. And are you also
referring to state trust land as
well or just in the state gets
some as well. Maam chairs
representative, uh, I'm also
aware of counties like Torrance
County and others where the uh
Financing agreements they've
reached with renewable energy
providers, whether it's for the
renewable energy, whether it's
for the transmission. That's
funding uh new ambulances,
that's funding schools, um,
those sorts of things. In
Wyoming, Madam Chair of Saint
Blanc, to go back to Wyoming, do
you recall what happened when
Wyoming instituted that tax.
Thank you Madam Chair, and thank
you a representative. I must
call you senator, sorry. You're
Mr. Chair as well.
But yes, I do, and I believe we
had this discussion last year in
this committee.
Great. And Madam Chair,
representative block, I, I, I
think so.
What I recall happening is that
an industry that was growing and
creating jobs, bringing value to
a state.
Stopped
That you see an increasing line
of production that is renewable
energy.
This tax was imposed and that uh
ascent stopped and it stalled,
and Madame Chelan.
As I recall that stall lasted an
extended amount of time. And
frankly, they still haven't
recovered from that.
Uh, so, Madam Chair
Representative,
Um
If I'm what I'm looking at is,
so say, you know, more than 5000
jobs, and we sort of agree
broadly on that. We agree that
there's room for growth.
It terrifies me and one of the
reasons I can't support the bill
is because to me it says we're
putting 5, 10, perhaps.
15,000 people out of work.
With a single.
Policy choice that's being
proposed today.
And the reason, Madam Chevlan.
That I draw that conclusion is a
place like Wyoming, where they
went through this, they
instituted this tax. Now, let me
move on briefly. Madam Chair
Representative, what's the
largest
Uh, share growing share of our
state budget general fund
outside, well, even inclusive
now of oil and gas production
since we've insulated our uh
general fund from that.
I think
Thank you, Madam Chair, and uh.
Representative uh wind energy.
my understanding actually is uh
investments, as a matter of
fact.
Um, the, uh, investments that
the state is making based off of
production. I want, I'm excited
to talk a bit about production,
oil and gas production. Uh, it's
coming from investments. Um,
And Madam Chair, Representative
Block, I think to me, one of the
things that that says is that
we're not in this sort of dire
fiscal situation where we need
to say, we'll, we'll sacrifice
100 or 15,000 jobs.
In order to raise, you know, 50
odd million or what have you.
That's not an equation, Madam
Chair represent block in my sort
of
Looking at it, that bears out,
putting 5, 10, 15,000 New
Mexicans out of work.
Uh, as opposed, in return for
raising money that um yeah,
don't think we need. Finally,
Madam Chair, representative
Block, just to talk briefly
about production, which I am
Mindful of grateful for, and
excited to think about. Do you
know roughly what our rig count
is right now?
Thank you, Madam Chair. I have
not looked in the last week or
so, but I, I would be happy to
provide that to you
representative from the oil
patch, Madam Chair
Representative, you're right on
sort of the, the numbers that I
look at the public numbers
updated weekly. Uh, I believe
it's at 102, Ma'am chair
Representative, do you know
roughly what the production or
how many barrels of oil we
produced last month.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I, I
don't have that figure in front
of me, but I do have it in a
packet of papers that I have in
my desk, I've got it here
on the
energy information
administration man chair
representative, it's roughly
it's over 65 million.
Remarkable. There's a lot to
work through my first year,
Madam Chair, representative my
1st January 12.9 million
barrels, roughly again according
to EIA.
Um, Madam Chair Representative.
One of the conclusions I draw
from this is I want to come back
to jobs.
If we agree over 5000 New
Mexicans employed in clean
energy now.
That it's a rapidly growing
industry, and Madam Chair
Representative.
My conclusion looking at another
state that did this tax.
is they put people out of work.
They stopped projects.
Um, we're looking at two
fundamentally different energy
sources. Madam Chair
representative, would you agree
that a severance tax is based
upon severing a mineral from the
state of New Mexico.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative, uh, it is,
however, this, this is an excise
tax in this bill.
It does go to the severance
fund, which is a little
confusing, right? But I think
it's the best fund for those
revenues because it's so, so
closely watched by the
legislature that we do have a
lot of eyeballs on it, and those
funds can indeed be managed and.
and invested properly, which is
why it's going to that fun,
Madam Chair. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you,
representative. Um.
It
The, uh
My takeaway, one of my takeaways
is that this is, we're, we're
looking at in this legislation.
Two forms of energy as the same.
That sever the severance tax
model being applied to renewable
energy, uh, treats it like oil
and gas or coal or uranium or
another mineral that's uh
here in the state in situ, has
to come up and that's how you
draw revenue.
Madam Chair Representative.
I
It's just not the case, and sure
representative, the jobs that
are on the line from clean
energy.
are uh paying the Mexicans, uh,
Really good salaries, keeping
rural communities, Madam Chair
Representative afloat. In some
cases, bringing people back to
rural communities.
At the same time as they support
um
The low and zero carbon abundant
energy future that we so
desperately need. And Madam
Chair Representative, uh, oil
and gas production, which we are
deeply fortunate to have, which
were, again, we're now the 2nd
largest producer, uh, they're
producing far more volume.
Far more.
And so it's, they are an
essential.
Integral
Deeply valued part of our state.
We don't need to compete one
against the other. We don't need
to sacrifice one against the
other, and Madam Chair,
representative again, uh, the
idea of, of killing 10, 15,000
jobs per
Funding that we don't need
comparing energy sources that
are totally different.
I can't support it, although I
do appreciate having these
conversations and appreciate you
bringing the bill forward. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative Nix.
Representative Henry.
Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Madam Chair Representative
Block, I do want to allow you to
expand a little bit on other
states around us and and the
taxes that they're using, if you
would, sir.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you Representative Henry, I
appreciate that. We got 2 Johns
in the house now, or more
John's, I guess, so that's
awesome. So I would just say
first of all, regarding the
jobs.
In energy, we want jobs, right?
No one is anti-job, I don't
think, and this legislature, I
sure hope not. I think what
we're looking for is continued
investment in our state because
we see how policies we've heard
of.
One single policy annihilating
an entire industry.
We've seen how the energy
transition Act has forced
thousands of jobs out of San
Juan County.
With the four corners.
power plant and the uh San Juan
generating station closed.
Because they had to hit these
standards that were not
attainable, and now there are
thousands and thousands of New
Mexicans without jobs. Someone
just sent me the number of
renewables jobs in the state of
New Mexico right now. It's about
2744 as of 2023, I think that's
the latest data they could find.
So, I mean, we're not looking at
10s of thousands of jobs that we
want to kill, because I think if
we're going to kill tens of
thousands of jobs with a 3.75%
tax. That is totally crazy. So
your, your, your point, I want
to talk to you a little
bit about a few states that are
similar to ours, but I also
don't think that states should
be thought of thought of as
monolithic, right? If we just
copy paste whatever California
or or Wyoming does, then that's,
I don't think that's good policy
because it needs to be tailored
to the land of enchantment, so I
have a list here.
Madam chair and representative
of other states that have
certain projects similar to, to
this tax. So we have Iowa, we
have Michigan, we have
Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma,
South Dakota, and Texas.
Texas is based upon the the
income tax rate, so that is a
little different, but it's, it's
very similar. So that's
according to the American Bar
Association, you can look it up
on their website, but there are
other states that are indeed
taxing renewables, and they have
thriving energy sectors there.
Madam Chair Representative, uh,
I, I do understand that, that
we're one of the leading in wind
wind energy at the moment. Um,
can you tell me how much of that
stays in the state of New Mexico
and how much.
Elsewhere.
leave Arizona, California is the
right primary.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I need
to look at the breakdown from
the, the energy information
association.
Or administration rather. I
think it's a bit, I think the
last one I saw was 46% for for
both, so wind and solar. So
about 46% stays in the state, a
majority then goes to other
states like California or
Arizona or whoever is the
highest bidder, I suppose, or,
you know, I, I feel for their
ratepayers over there, right,
but they're they're getting
that that energy from us.
Thank you, Representative Madam
Chair, another question I have
does go along the job uh.
Question that you had, you've
sort of answered a little bit,
but.
I would like to expand on it. If
we go to zero emissions by 2050,
what happens to the oil and gas
industry jobs.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you Representatives.
Pretty much they dissolve. There
is no way that the oil and gas
industry can thrive and survive
in a state where it is almost
impossible to
Produce the energy, so
communities like Artesia where
you're the mayor.
We're going to dry up, places
like Levington, Hobbs, Carlsbad.
We're not gonna see population
centers there.
And
That would be unfortunate
because I love our whole state,
right? I want every single
community in our state to thrive
because we have, we have
different sectors that power us.
Like if I go to Silver City,
they have extractive industries
out there. They have rare
minerals that we harness for our
American energy.
Sector and security. So I think
it's super important to look at
those micro details in the
microeconomic framework and say,
OK, how is this gonna hurt?
The communities that produce the
most but may get treated.
Possibly the worst, and I think
that would be those sectors.
All across the southeast corner
of New Mexico, the northwest
corner, and I think we need to
really be super vigilant when it
comes to policymaking in those
communities.
Thank you, Representative Madam
Chair. Madam Chair, the last
question I really have, um,
is if we look at this.
Let me think of how
The oil and gas industry, you
said.
These taxes came online about
the same time, according to what
you had told us earlier.
If we did that,
What's the expected expectations
in 202,050.
How many jobs do you think will
come online? Uh, will we replace
oil and gas industry jobs.
Because I'm like you, I, I'm
very concerned about jobs in New
Mexico, um, I also very much
appreciate Representative
Spoll's comments on, I do think
this is an industry wind energy
that can add to the
Other counties that might not be
as fortunate as Eddie and Lee
and San Juan to have the oil and
gas industries, but I do want to
make sure that we're on an
equitable equal playing field,
uh, with all industries and
making sure that as we're we're
looking at these, we all have
the fair shot at making it.
That makes sense. It did. Thank
you so much, Madam Chair and
Representative, so currently
from and I looked it up at the
uh.
Energy.gov, right? That's what
tracks how much.
Production we have, how many
jobs we have in the state. Oil
and gas.
31,705 jobs.
That's 3% of.
All jobs in the state of New
Mexico.
It's a huge section.
huge part of just employment in
the state of New Mexico. So I, I
just, I just can't really abide
by the argument that this tax
would
Takeaway jobs, a couple 2000.
While displacing 31,000 workers.
Who are in these industries that
we rely on to power this capital
as we sit in here today.
And I think it's critical that
we look very closely at the
policymaking that we have
because I've heard the argument,
right? New Mexico, if we put a
3.75% tax on renewables, we're
going to cripple renewable
industries.
That's not.
The shining beautiful vision
that they've given us in many of
these policy papers that we see
before us in the interim.
We see a lot, Madam Chair and
Representative about how good
New Mexico is when it comes to
wind and solar production, we
outrank every other state in
this country when it comes to
just the bare resources that we
have available to us just
because of our land.
So
I don't think that's, you know,
I'm, I'm looking for the cities
of gold. We found it here in New
Mexico when it comes to
renewables. Why can't we have
both? Why not complement one
with the other. I've even seen
some, some land where there's an
oil rig on the land, and there's
a, there's a wind turbine right
above it. There is nothing wrong
with that, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative. Thank
you.
I think Representative Nick is
Representative Montoya.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Um
Representative, um, do
appreciate uh comments by
Representative small uh
acknowledging that
We can kill business with taxes.
That's uh
That's uh
That's a good acknowledgement.
That's something we need to keep
in mind as we go forward, all of
us, that what effect?
Taxes on an industry can do to
employment and can do.
Uh, frankly, to the businesses
that we impose those taxes on.
Um
Something else that was that
that's been mentioned and, and
I, I really can't avoid this,
and that is because
Uh, directly affected, uh
friends and family of mine, and
that is a shuttering of the.
Uh, coal power plant and the
coal mine.
In San Juan County.
Um
That was well over 2000 jobs
between the
Between the mine and the power
plant.
And then the direct
Daily subcontractors who worked
on site. So, um,
Uh, with all due respect, uh, we
don't.
Uh, as a body seemed to care
whether or not we put people out
of work, or whether or not we're
willing to hurt a
A
Community, um, the, the, the
shutting down of
The San Juan generating station
in San Juan County has nearly
crippled.
Uh, the, uh, central
consolidated School District
that along with the other power
plant coal mine, or, or the
generally the only sources of
tax base.
Or central consolidated school
district, which is the 2nd
largest school district in the
state, uh, besides, um,
Albuquerque, the Albuquerque
School District.
I would like to see.
I, I, I actually wish this bill
would have gone first to the tax
committee.
Cause this is really a tax bill.
And um
Every year, actually, uh,
Representative Henry will be
joining me uh tomorrow we will
have our
Our first meeting there and the
first thing that will happen in
that committee is a discussion
of good tax policy.
Um
So, I know you've not served on
tax, but uh could you tell me
what are some of the
Main things that we look for in
tax policy.
Sure, thank you, Madam Chair,
and thank you, Representative.
You know what, I actually
I can go through them on the FIR
with you because they claim that
this is horrible tax policy, and
I'd love to just disprove that.
So one.
Be
The way that the tax is set up.
So,
There's an argument.
And I'm, I'm gonna play devil's
advocate here because I like to
be fair, right?
There's an argument that we're
subsidizing an industry on one
end.
And we're taxing it.
On the other end.
And that's the argument that we
hear against the bill.
However
Currently, with oil and gas.
Oh, with many industries.
Agriculture, for example.
We subsidize it on the front
end.
And we tax it on the back end.
So I agree with you. I think
that we need to clean up our tax
structure. We've got a lot of
problems that I've heard
regarding our uh gross receipts
taxes, for example, the
pyramidding.
There's a lot of bills that I've
heard in the past from people
like Representative Harper and
folks who who've brought that
forward in the past to help fix
these problems, but I think
that's probably the main concern
that we're looking at when it
comes to tax policy, and I would
love to clean it up for every
industry, but I think I'm just
going to start small and and
stick with this bill for now,
but I would love to work with
you.
Appreciate that, um, Madam
Chair, um,
It was mentioned earlier.
How bad tax policy can harm an
industry.
And that is a concern in the tax
committee, which I previously
served on for 8 years.
Um, so I've heard, I've heard
the
Uh, discussion as to what's good
and bad tax policy.
But one thing that
Jumps out is.
In in this bill that you're
presenting today is
Trying to treat.
Energy sources with some level
of equity.
Um, so, being fair in the tax
system is something that
And, and so, um,
Mm
I, I actually, besides the two
senators who previously
presented this uh uh uh bill in
the past, I believe it was
senators.
Trujillo
I was one of them and I, I
forget who the other, but there
were, there were Padilla.
Um, and I also in the past have
introduced this bill, and I
called it a pills tax payment in
lieu of severance.
Um, the reality is,
We have the direct competition.
To
Uh
Carbon-based fuels is renewals.
And in one instance, we are
subsidizing heavily.
And with the exception of the
other.
Type of taxes that all
businesses pay.
Um
We're not really replacing in
the budget.
Or even looking to replace in
the budget.
That tax
That we, if we're going to get
to zero carbon, I mean,
obviously to a zero carbon
future means zero.
Oil and gas dollars.
And
If we're going to replace.
Those dollars, there has to be
a, a mechanism and and one of
the things that I really like
about this bill is.
It puts a tax on
Uh, and I think your numbers
were incorrect. I think I've
heard 70% of all of New Mexico.
Uh, renewables are actually
going out of state.
Um, I've heard that number twice
that I could be wrong, but that
was.
I've seen those numbers twice.
Um
And I believe it was mentioned
even by one of the, the.
posts in the audience that
presented that that may be a
and attacks of
Uh, going out of state, um,
Might be more acceptable than
What would happen to, you know,
a New Mexico taxpayer. So that
that might be a consideration. I
would really like to see this
session discussion go forward to
tax committee.
Um
That being said,
If we're going to talk about
what
Ha, what is going directly into
the
Uh, general fund. I have these
numbers because I'm presenting a
memorial today, recognizing oil
and gas for their contribution.
Uh, to our, to the New Mexico
state budget. And I, and these
numbers are shocking.
But
49%.
Is direct dollars from the oil
and gas industry. Payments from
oil and gas companies to the
general fund.
That doesn't include.
Um, all of the taxes paid by
individuals who work in the
industry, and you quoted 31,000
direct jobs, but once you
include all of the service jobs,
not just the drilling jobs, not
just the production jobs. It's
well over 100,000 direct and
indirect jobs in the state of
New Mexico. So when we passed
the ETA and when we
are going towards zero
emissions, we really are not
concerned about whether or not
we put people out of work.
Um, so I, I, it's, it's just
To me, watching my industry back
home and how, how devastating it
was.
to our local economy, to put
that many people out of work at
one time.
This would be at a statewide
level. So, I, I, I appreciate
comments about how can we find a
way
To keep this industry alive
while allowing another industry
to grow.
That that is just not the
agenda.
We, we really are looking at
putting this many people out of
work and taking this much money
out of the budget. So I do
appreciate, and if you could
respond to this,
It seems to me when I presented
this bill.
It was
In an effort to figure out how
do we start to backfill the
dollars that we know will
eventually go away.
If we do away
I mean, this tremendous amount
of money, $13 billion.
In taxes to the state.
In state and local tax revenue.
7
$400,000 directly to the state
general fund.
2.3 billion.
dollars
Going directly towards education
in New Mexico.
This is staggering.
If we're going to
Tax
And regulate
This industry out of business.
Something has to replace it.
Something
And if it's not the industry
that's directly coming in to
replace it.
It's gonna be the taxpayers.
And the reality, it's gonna be
the taxpayers anyway.
Because even if we tax this
Tax renewables.
It's gonna go to the ratepayers.
Unless we're taxing what's going
out of state.
That would be a way to
potentially subsidize. So I
really do love this portion of
your provision, but could you
address
This information that I just
just discussed with you.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Representative, and I think
it's a great point that you
make.
100,000 people, I, I'm sure you
know those communities better
than I do.
I don't live in the oil patch,
you know, we actually have oil
in the uh basin that I live in.
I'd love to tap into that
resource, right, but.
There's a lot from 100 years ago
that that protects that from
happening. But what I would say
is.
The jobs that are created.
In any industry.
I think
Our jobs at the end of the day.
We want them to be here.
We want those jobs to help
assist industries like, like
renewables, like oil and gas.
But we also have to be smart
about tax policy like, like
you're saying.
And when it comes to
Renewables
I don't know if they'll ever
make up 50% of the budget.
But that's pretty much what we
need to make up if we completely
annihilated oil and gas.
We need to make up 50% of the
budget, which is about almost
$11 billion right now, or
We would need to cut 50% of the
budget.
And we saw what happened when we
had to cut the budget in the
early 2010s.
And it was painful.
For teachers
For healthcare workers
For people across all sectors,
our budget had to slim down, but
it was even it all that slimming
down was a drop in the bucket.
Compared to what we may have to
do by 2035 and 2050 if we do
indeed hit this 50% goal that
we're claiming is going to help
save the world, right? If we're
going to do our part here in New
Mexico.
Then we need to also
Be aware of those nurses, those
doctors, those teachers.
Those healthcare workers, those.
Food service workers who had
jobs in the Permian, and now
they don't, or they have jobs
over in San Juan County, and now
they don't. What, what are they
going to go to? Where are they
gonna go? And I fear, Madam
chair.
They're going to leave our
state.
And I don't want that.
Because fewer people in New
Mexico means fewer
representation in Congress.
It means fewer people in this
legislature.
It means fewer people being
represented by us, who should be
their advocates and in many
policy positions were taking
away their jobs, or taking away
their opportunity, and I'm
someone who wants to build upon
people's opportunity. That's why
I bring forward these tax bills
to reduce GRT on microbusinesses
so that we can thrive in New
Mexico. We have policies that
can implement industries that we
maybe don't know about. Let's,
let's have more.
Thoughtful discussion about how
we replace what we have, or at
least slim down while replacing
with certain industries like the
one I just mentioned, you know,
I don't know if it'll work, but
online sports betting is working
in New York. They're getting
billions of dollars with that,
right?
We could try that. I'm not here
to cripple industries. What I'm
here to do is supplant those
industries with good paying jobs
for generations to come, and it
also means supporting renewables
as well.
Me, um.
I do believe that uh
Representative Smalls comments
were
Something we need to consider.
And that is
It really could harm an
industry.
Taxes
I believe somebody mentioned
earlier that that that
That this tax is premature.
But it is eventual.
Um, if it's not now, at some
point.
We have to replace.
The dollars that are coming in
from oil and gas from somewhere.
That is something that we as a
body, need to
Pay attention to
Um, I know I like taking those
uh capital outlay dollars and
taking care of important
projects in my community, and I
think everybody, I haven't seen
anybody yet reject taking those
capital outlay dollars and
spending them in their community
that come directly from oil and
gas.
But
I would like to see this bill.
pass out of here, even if it's
on a no wreck.
Just so this discussion can be
had in the proper committee,
which is the tax committee.
Um, where we will talk about
good tax policy.
No doubt it will, it will die
there as well, cause I do
believe.
I I actually hear.
Uh, folks from the industry, and
I do believe without the
generous subsidies that we're
putting forward and without
burdening with further taxes. I
think it's likely right, could
very likely harm the industry. I
think that's a fair point.
Uh
If this were in a vacuum,
That would be the only fair
point.
The other fair point that's just
not being addressed here, which
needs to be addressed by the tax
committee.
Uh, Madam Chair, is
What are we doing as we're
putting one industry out of
Out, out of
Business.
How do we replace the revenue.
Because we are spending money
like that money is going to be
here forever.
Um, we have spent since I've
been here the budget has
doubled.
And, and literally in the last 6
years, the budget has doubled.
Um
And I came in, as you stated
earlier, Representative Block, I
came in when we had to sweep.
Dollars back that were unspent
by boards, commissions, school
districts.
Um, because, because the, the,
the, the, the
The cost at the uh of
Oil, uh, by the barrel had gone
down so dramatically, you know,
it really was killing.
The budget where we will soon be
there again.
And we have to find, but Madam
Chair, the reason I would love
to see this bill go to the tax
committee is because
The reality is
The cost to the ratepayer.
On electricity has already
doubled since the ETA.
If we also raise taxes, that'll
be a double hit.
On New Mexico residents, New
Mexico taxpayers.
Um
We have to really address this.
We have to decide, are we
really, really willing to, to
kill the golden goose.
Are we really willing to chase?
The folks who provide
Over half of our budget.
Are we really willing to chase
them out of the state.
I, I would suggest we find a
way.
To help industry that is
currently providing
What we're enjoying in this
budget surplus. We keep them
alive and then find a way.
To grow
A renewable industry.
That, uh, in New Mexico.
Mm
Without
Harming the ratepayer without
harming the taxpayer. So please
uh consider.
This is not the right committee
for this bill to be heard.
If we could have this discussion
in the tax committee.
Uh
I know it won't survive there,
but at least this discussion
needs to be had.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you Representative Nex is
Representative Dixon.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh,
thank you, Representative for uh
this bill and, uh, you know, a
fascinating discussion.
Um
Really just uh sort of two
questions. Um,
Do you know what the um.
Global, uh, output for
production of oil and gas.
was in 2022.
Many million barrels a day.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I
believe it was about 103.
if I'm not mistaken, Madam
Chair, that's, I have 93 or 97
million. So, um,
And then do you know what the
projection is, uh, for 2050,
according to the International
Energy Agency.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative. You got me
there. Ah, good. OK, well, this
actually gets to the concern
that, that um some of the
committee has expressed, and I
think a very valid concern about
um whether or not, um, you know,
this, um, we'll be losing all of
the jobs and, you know, the
Permian and San Juan Basin, uh,
if, um,
You know, we don't equitably
tax.
Uh, renewables, um, in fact, the
International Energy Agency, um,
is projecting that uh production
will be 93.1 million barrels per
day in 2050.
So that's actually not um
suggesting that the oil and gas
production is going to go away.
Uh.
Representative Madam Chair, uh,
do you know why, uh, oil and gas
production is not going to be
going away.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative. So I would have
to look at the figures, right?
I, I would hate to comment on
something that's speculative,
but what I would say is if uh
the EIA is saying it. I'm sure
it's based on some kind of
projection, however, I would, I
would just caution.
We have to look at New Mexico,
not on a global scale, in my
opinion. I, I think maybe in
some aspects, but I think at
least in the short term when
we're looking to transition our
budget to a more.
Diversified portfolio.
That we also look at other
sectors that may be coming into
play, because I, I'm sure that
you'd agree that there is still
a lot of potential when it comes
to oil and gas, when it comes to
the money that's coming in, at
least in the near future. And so
I would hope that that's also
considered.
Great. Thank you. Well, um, and
so the, the answer though of why
decline, you know, oil and gas
production will decline. Um,
however, um, what I think is
important to remember about uh
New Mexico production is that it
is, um, as my colleague and I
were discussing some of the
cleanest.
Uh, oil and gas in the world and
um you know,
A lot of oil and gas goes to
petrochemicals.
Um, and other
Other uses, so not just energy
generation. So, when we talk
about oil and gas versus
renewables. Um, that's not
actually.
It's not
They're not mutually exclusive,
um, and they're not necessarily
competitors because oil and gas,
um, does have a, an important
role to fill in the global
economy outside of energy
generation. I just wanted to
flag that I'm in in um.
In the context of diversified
portfolio. We did hear, um,
testimony from a representative
of
Um some of the um.
Renewable energy, um,
associations, uh.
Mr. Chair, are we back to,
sorry.
Adam Chair
OK.
um, and representative, just
wanna make sure I'm on track
here. Um, that, um, you know,
the renewable company companies
do actually pay a number of uh
different forms of tax in New
Mexico, ranging from GRT and uh
property tax and employment tax,
all of those things. Um, and
I would argue that rather than
um potentially.
Shutting down an industry in New
Mexico.
Um, by imposing an additional
tax on one sector, what the
state should really be doing is
investing in growing our other
Economic development
opportunities, uh, for instance,
Aerospace and space,
biosciences, advanced computing.
Um, and other types of clean
energy and and water
conservation and so um.
Mr. Chair, Representative, um,
as much as I appreciate the
discussion, um, you know,
positing, uh, renewables versus
oil and gas. I don't think that
we should actually be discussing
it that way. Um, I think we
should be talking about growing
the pie for everyone.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, except Murphy.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Representative, thank you for
your, your bill and discussion
today. I think my colleagues,
all of them, um, have talked a
lot about energy and revenue
replacement.
Um, we have touched on jobs, and
I'd like to follow up, um, a
little bit on that and and then
the impact of the job market uh
with respect to tax policy.
Um, the way I understand your
bill is that it's overall
purpose is to begin a relatively
small revenue stream from
non-traditional energy sources,
basically ending sort of picking
winners and losers and bringing
some equity to tax market where
it with respect to that.
You note that the renewable uh
and, and I'm from Chabots County
and, and obviously, um.
No, uh, represent a lot of oil
and gas, uh, workers and
producers.
Um, also a large agricultural um
component, but also a large
renewable presence as well. We
have solar, uh, wind, um, um,
and I support all of those. I'm
in all of the above and um some
may suspect that
being an oil and gas producer,
I'm somewhat um
Um, opposed to competition and,
and that's, I think everybody in
the industry recognizes.
That we do need to trans
transition just as we always
have.
Um, you know, man began by, um,
you know, burning wood, and then
peat, and then coal, and we've
now found a lot of energy in
this molecule we call
hydrocarbons.
And so, transitions are the
nature of, of, of.
energy development and I welcome
that.
And if I can channel a little
bit of Tom Billy Bob Thornton's
Tommy Norris character in
Landman, we're not gonna, we're
not gonna die um from oil and
gas. We're gonna die from from
not having a replacement for oil
and gas, and we need to move
towards that rapidly.
Now, to my question on tax
policy.
Um, Mr. Chairman, representative
block, um, it's been suggested
that tax policy has a lot to do
uh with impact on jobs.
We're talking about a renewable
market of roughly I'm just gonna
round off 3000 jobs.
Um, oil and gas, we have roughly
32,000 directs, additional
70,000 injera. So, if it's true
that tax policy does impact.
Oil and gas and that uh oh
excuse me uh jobs.
If we put a if this body elected
to put a 3.75% on renewables.
And that was going to kill the
job growth of that industry.
Would not the converse be true
that if we eliminated the 3.75
on traditional oil and gas
sources that jobs would also be
created, and you're looking at a
market of direct jobs, 10 times
that.
So could you comment on that for
me, uh, Mr. Chairman
Representative block.
Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman,
Representative, I think that's a
very good point, right? If we
just flip it on the other side.
Let's take away that.
If we take away that 3.75%. We
also take away all of our
capital outlay, right? And so
it's total proof positive that
tax policy does make a
significant impact on
communities and people, and if
we did the opposite, we took
away that 3.75% tax, maybe it
would create jobs. Maybe we
wouldn't reinvest those dollars
in different ways, and maybe it
would continue to, maybe it
would be 200,000 jobs.
Next year or whenever we did
that.
But I agree, I think that's a
very good point. And I think
it's good that we're discussing
that in this committee because
it's not the tax committee, but
we do have a lot of members who
are on tax committee and this
committee, which really helps a
lot when it comes to that.
Mr. Chairman.
Um, Representative Block, um,
following up on that a little
bit. The um
The
It was suggested that that the
tax um
In Wyoming really stifled the
development um there. However,
you also listed a number of
states that have done this, and
it doesn't seem that it's had
the same impact, so I wonder if
that was really.
Reason, if it was the tax that
did it, I will, you know, uh,
there might have been a lot of
mitigating, um,
Mitigating factors, but would
you agree?
That
As a
As a state
Just as businesses have to
compete and be efficient.
That as a state, New Mexico has
to compete and be efficient as
well, with respect to uh
attracting new jobs.
Um, and I think that's very
important. So, for example,
If the adjoining states.
Uh, which are very similar to
New Mexico in many regards.
Um, have this, or some of them
do, and it hasn't been a
problem, then why would it be a
problem here, in your opinion?
Why would they why would people
oppose that when we have
examples nearby.
Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman
and Representative. And I think
that's a really, really
interesting point to make
because I see this, this Rita
study that talks about the
potential of wind and solar in
New Mexico. We've probably the
best potential for these
industries of any of our
neighboring states, this report
from the interim says it's
137,000 megawatts of highest
quality wind potential on state
trust land, that's just state
trust.
Then it also says 824,000
megawatt hour potential of
highest quality solar potential
on state trust land. So if we're
looking just at the numbers
here.
If I was a solar, I like to
reverse engineer things. If I
was a solar or wind producer.
I might be in the future, who
knows, right? If I was, I would
be looking at New Mexico as.
A gleaming beacon of
Potential for revenue
generation, and I think that
that is what we offer that a lot
of states don't offer. So
Wyoming, they have a lot of
sunlight too. I think we have a
little more sun than they do.
We're pretty cool. And we also
have a very windy state. So I
think these kind of factors
natural elements to our state.
Give us all the potential,
including oil and gas deposits
in the Permian Basin, right?
That's a blessing and a gift
that we've been given in our
state, and I think that's just
one little spoke on the wheel
that we need to be addressing.
Mr. Chairman and Representative,
I'm up here with um because I
know you're anxious to move
things along. Um,
I'm a geoscientist.
And um, so that means I have
some background in geology and
Geophysics and all of those
really nerdy areas that, that
people have for the graduate
from the New Mexico Tech usually
come out with.
And I will say this, and I'm
also a businessman and and one
that operates in multiple
states, although primarily in
New Mexico.
And
Mexico is blessed. We're blessed
with the sun and the wind. We've
also, um, share a basin with
Texas. Permian Basin has 3 parts
to it, the Midland Basin
primarily and in uh in Texas as
it suggests central basin
platform which goes across New
Mexico and Texas and the
Delaware Basin on the west side
which we are absolutely has the
best rock in the world.
If, if it was not for that, most
of the development would be
occurring in the Texas line
because we have in this state.
A more severe tax and regulatory
policy, then Texas does.
Now, luckily, we've got good
rock and good production to help
make up for that.
And I think that does
demonstrate that if we were not
blessed with that.
That and we need to take heed
because as these basins are
developed, they become um they
they they become um both were
technological and economical
side more challenging, so, um,
at any rate, I would, I would
hope that you would agree that
if we could equalize tax and
regulatory policy to be
competitive with our adjoining
states, we should. Thank you
very much, Mr. Chairman.
Repsol.
The motion from the committee.
move a do pass with no wreck.
Substitute motion to table.
We have a substitute motion on
the table that motion takes
precedence. Do we know where it
represents, uh, synacortesis.
We're gonna
take him in and see if we can
find her.
Did we get a 2nd on that motion?
Second
Thank you.
Appreciate that.
OK, um
Nina, could you take the boat,
please?
Representative Abeda.
So, especially for the newbies,
it's uh it's yes the table or no
table. So the, the, the vote.
If a vote of yes, uh, tables,
but no, we would be back on the
discussion.
Representative Cortez.
Note
I just walked in, at the table.
Representative Dixon.
Yes to table.
Representative Garcia.
Representative Grola
to table.
Representative Henry.
Not a table
Representative Montoya.
No a table.
Representative Murphy, not the
table.
Representative Small.
Representative Soriana.
Jerry McQueen.
Yes
by about 6 to 4 the bill has
been tabled.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I
love the discussion. I really
appreciate it. It's always good
to be in your committee. Thank
you very much.
Uh, we have another bill on the
agenda, uh, we're representative
Saranana is presenting, um.
I missed a good part of that
discussion because I was out of
the room.
Um, and I didn't feel I didn't
really want to interject myself
in the discussion. I will say it
seemed to me like we were
talking a lot about oil and gas.
Uh, on bill that tax renewables.
And so I, I may, you know, in
the future ask you to stay on
the bill.
So just keep that in mind.
Representative Sarata House Bill
51 energy storage, income tax
credit.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and
members of the committee, um.
Uh, I am here to present in
Hospital 21 shortage income tax
credit my expert witness.
him introduce himself.
I suspect you need to pull the
microphone closer to maybe put
over to the side and point it
in, there we go.
OK, thank you.
Right
Good morning, uh, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Jim Dejardin. I'm the
executive director of the
renewable Energy Industries
Association of New Mexico. We
have over 60 members and we've
been around since 2004, and I've
been in the solar industry in
various capacities since 2010.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, we have an
amendment. Do we want?
Um
Ever since starting, uh, do you,
do you want to explain the bill,
uh, uh, first or you want to go
straight to the amendment, would
that be helpful.
Like I explained the bill first.
OK.
Um, first, with all the new
people, I just want um explain
what energy storage system is,
so it is a technology that
captures and stores energy for
use at a later time, OK, um, how
Bill 51 would add new sections
to the Income Tax Act and the
corporate Income and franchise
Tax Act. It would create a
non-refundable tax credit of
40%.
of the cost of taxpayers to
purchase and install 11
certified energy storage system
on their property beginning on
or after January 1st, 2025 until
January 1st, 2030.
The maximum credit is $6000 for
a residential property and
150,000 for a commercial
industrial or agricultural
property.
The taxpayer must apply for the
certification of eligibility
from MR Energy Minerals and
Natural Resources Department.
Within a year following the
calendar year in which the
system becomes operational.
Um, a taxpayer may not claim
both personal and corporate. Is
it, is it on? No.
Income tax for
The same property.
Do you want me to switch?
No, I, I think you just need to
sort of put it directly in front
of your face.
I, I agree, and it's if you turn
your head a little, it tends to
go in and out. OK.
Um, the aggregate amount of
credit that Ener may certify to
eligible taxpayers annually is
$6 million. Is that too loud?
OK. Property owners may obtain
tax credits for the tax year
with available certification if
the aggregate cap of the text of
the credit has already been
certified.
Any tax credit that exceeds the
taxpayer's liability in the year
the credit is claimed and may be
carried forward for a maximum of
5 consecutive years.
And Energy, minerals and natural
resources department would
provide information on
certificates issued to the Tax
and Revenue Department and
include the tax credit in its
taxable expenditure budget. So
why do we need this bill?
Um
House Bill 51 would provide,
would promote wider adoption of
energy storage throughout New
Mexico and provide localized
energy storage to property
owners, allow rural, urban and
suburban communities to make
more energy efficient and
provide.
Access to a reliable um backup
electricity.
Um, especially during extreme
fires and floods like we've seen
the United States, it's cost
efficient, um, if you store the
energy during off-peak hours and
use it during peak hours, it'll
save you money. Um.
And it it it it's integration
with renewables as renewable
energy sources like wind and
solar intermittent. Energy
storage systems can store XF
energy generated during peak
production time for use when
demand is higher or supply is
low.
So if I have 8 boys in my
household and I know they're
gonna be home at 5. I can store
the energy and turn it on, the
energy storage system during
peak times when so my electric
bill won't be as high.
Um
I think I'll go and pass it on
to my expert witness.
Thank you very much, Vice Chair
Sareana. um.
I would just um cap that by
saying that the future of the
solar industry and as it was
mentioned in the presentation of
the previous bill were blessed
to have a tremendous solar
resource in the state. It's so
good that we basically need to
store energy at certain times
because there's actually an
almost too much of it at, at
certain times of the day during
certain times of the year.
Conversely, there are times when
there's not enough, so the
ability to store energy is the
future.
Solar industry and in New Mexico
right now, we have an extremely
low attachment rate, in other
words, the amount of solar
systems that are coupled with
energy storage system. It's
about 1%. So to put that in
perspective nationwide, the
attachment rate is around 12 to
15%
calan for California and Hawaii
exceed 50%. So clearly there's a
need to incentivize more
attachment rates so that we can.
Solar with storage.
Thank you.
OK, and before we go to the
audience or go to the committee,
there's an amendment.
Um
Mr.
I'm sorry, I was gonna move the
moment for discussion. Thank you
for that.
Um
Representative Sarala, would you
care to explain your amendment?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So the
amendment just says, um, you can
only have one energy storage
system. If you have a
residential energy storage
system, you can't use that same
energy storage system for
corporate industry or ag.
And that's the first part of the
amend amendment. Second one is
just you can't use a corporate
energy storage system as a
residential energy system and
the strikeouts are just it's
already in some, it's another
place in the bill, so it's just
striking that out, putting it in
a in a new place.
I'm just moving this language in
the bill, is that correct? And,
and, and yes.
Um
Would someone like to move the
amendment for adoption, or is
there any discussion on the
amendment?
Chairman, I have a question.
What if Mr. Chairman
representative, pardon me, um.
What if, what if you have a
person that's working from home.
How does that work? I mean,
because they basically are in
their corporate.
So to speak
That it's also their home.
So Murphy, um, I think that goes
to the, the, the bill. I'd like
to just get the amendment out of
the way first.
So the, the amendment language
as I understand it, we're just
moving where the language
appears in the bill.
And then I, I mean, I, that's a
perfectly acceptable question.
Let's, if we could just hold off
on that for a second.
Um, OK, is there a motion to, is
there further discussion on the
amendment or motion to adopt the
amendment?
The 2nd
Is there any objection to
adopting the amendment.
OK, so Xing Nan, you have an
amended bill, um, and we'll come
back to the committee, uh,
Riverside Murphy, uh, first
we're gonna do public comment. I
understand the
Online comment is not working,
is that where we are?
OK
Um
Just by a show of hands, uh, who
here is in uh in support of this
pill?
Uh, who hears in opposition to
this bill?
OK, so, um,
If we could, uh,
do some, do come and support if
you guys can try try to figure
that out, we're gonna go to the
public first.
OK, so, uh, no more than 2
minutes and uh no more than 5
people. So if you'd like to
speak in support, uh, I guess
come to the center and we're
bringing a microphone out.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee. My name's Randy
Sadwick. I am the president of
Positive Energy, solar company
been in business since 1997. We
employ about 100 people now
they're in Santa Fe and the
average wage is about $36 an
hour.
Um
I, I support this bill, storage
is an essential part of the
energy transition because the
sun only shines about 6 hours a
day and sometimes the wind
doesn't blow and this feels an
essential gap for the energy
transition, and it's been proven
over and over again that
incentives do ultimately lower
the cost and, and this is what
we need for our energy
transition. It does provide
resiliency for natural
disasters.
And grid outages which we have
more and more.
And the technology is primed.
There are very competitive and
functioning brands, and finally,
the National Electric Code has
provided for safety measures to
address uh risks of uh fire and
so thank you very much.
Uh, good morning,
representatives. My name is
Glenn Weichel. I'm a power
systems, uh, and also an
activist with Third A New
Mexico. Mr. Reel that mic on.
I can hear myself really well.
Just hold up a little higher.
I'm sorry, just hold it up a
little higher, please. Sure,
yeah. OK, that's nice and loud.
Um, in my recent academic work
at NMSU, I spent years building
power grid models of energy
systems, which will run
sustainably for decades in the
future. So my models looked into
the future, uh, towards the
energy transition. My conclusion
is that a smart, reliable and
sustainable power grid in New
Mexico needs several more
gigawatts of
Battery storage to complete the
energy transition. This is 5 to
10 times more than what we have
today.
Battery energy storage systems
in your home are like energy
efficiency programs on steroids
instead of reducing energy
consumption, batteries can add
power to the grid when the power
grid is stressed by high demand.
They put downward pressure on
electrical rates on electricity
rates.
These batteries reduce the need
for power companies to invest
ratepayer funds in transmission
lines and grid scale energy
storage because they're
connected to your neighborhood
power lines, the power does not
have to compete for overloaded
transmission lines to reach
homes and other neighborhoods or
towns.
The power stays within your
neighborhood when you need it.
Furthermore, batteries offer a
healthy alternative to noisy,
smelly home generators, which
can poison you with carbon
monoxide.
They're a great option for rural
New Mexicans and people with
critical medical equipment to
ride through the occasional
power outage.
The proposed tax rebate.
Will improve health and support
the transition to clean energy,
which we so desperately need to
address the climate crisis.
Uh, I also wanted to add the
Representative Dixon has another
bill called Power Up New Mexico,
which will allow these batteries
to be
Bundled or aggregated together,
and the owners of the batteries
can actually earn money from the
power company for their
contribution uh to uh addressing
high power demand times. Thank
you. Yes, please pass the bill.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman, members of the
committee. My name is JD
Bullington and I'm here speaking
to you today on behalf of the
city of Santa Fe, which I
represent, and also public power
in New Mexico, which I also
represent, uh, both of these
organizations are strongly in
favor of this legislation. I
remember when it really wasn't
even that long ago where energy
storage technology was a dream.
It was just a concept, but the
technology has come a long way,
and energy storage is now
absolutely vital.
As we move forward.
With our energy transition
plants in the state, which
appear to be unstoppable. We're
on a path, um, for energy
transition and new technologies.
So this technology is extremely
important and we should do
everything we can to incentivize
its future development and get
it implemented and get it out
there cause it's a vital
component of our energy
transition plan. Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Chair and
respected members of the
community, uh committee, sorry.
Uh, my name is Abbas Ail, and
I'm here to represent two
organizations who support this
bill very strongly. The first is
the New Mexico Society of
Professional Engineers. I'm a
board member. The board has
reviewed all provisions of this
bill quite thoroughly, and we
fully endorse every provision of
this bill and recommend it to
pass. The second organization,
I'm also a board member of the
Tesla Owners Club of New Mexico.
And we strongly believe that
this bill will not only help the
Tesla owners in New Mexico, but
all present and future owners of
electric vehicles. So with those
two, I do recommend they do
pass, and I will also add, as
did some of uh my previous
public comment colleagues, uh,
that I'm a former staff member
from Sandia National Labs. I
worked on battery storage for
over 30 years, and these
technologies are now very safe.
They are.
All certified by national
certification Organizations, and
as the bill mentions, any
homeowner who installs these
systems will make sure Mlo will
make sure that these are
certified commercial systems. So
with that, I recommend a do
pass. Thank you.
Nice to see you Ris Navi.
Next
Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee, I'll be brief, um,
Melissa Bernardin. I'm with the
Sierra Club Rio Grande chapter.
Uh, we're in support of HB 51
for all the previously mentioned
reasons. I'm actually gonna
speak from a personal
perspective. I'm a resident of
Valencia County. Um, we are by
no means rich in my family. We
are working class, middle class,
and
Yet we've stretched our budget
to do our part to go green. Uh,
we purchased a used EV and with
the federal and state tax
credits, income tax credits
similar to this one, we were
able to finance rooftop solar.
We would really love on those
occasional times where we
experience partial day power
outages, um, to have the
security of battery storage, and
I think an income tax credit
like this would make it
affordable for families like
mine, uh, the, the current cost
would just be cost prohibitive
for us, so we strongly support
this bill. Thank you.
OK, so we, we, we set it 5, so
I'm just gonna keep it there,
um.
Are we, are we able to go
online?
OK. I can't see the online list.
Let's take 2 online speakers.
OK, and we're doing support.
Other way.
Glenn, are you there? OK, let's,
let's try one more person.
OK. So, Glenn, if you can hear
me, um, we're having technical
difficulties, and I apologize.
OK. Is there anyone who would
like to speak in opposition?
OK. Thank you very much, um,
seeing Nun, we're gonna go to
the committee and first up, uh
I'm gonna go back to
Representative Murphy.
Who had the question before and
Mr. Chairman, I represented.
Um, so I, I did ask a question
before and it had to do with um
won't be able to go with the
provision, but I know that
there's an exclusion from a a
commercial operation in a
private home. Could you explain
that to me and also address the
question.
Um
Oh, Mr. Chairman, um, he
explained to me how that works
and my concern is, you know, so
many people are working remotely
anyone who would like to speak
in opposition.
OK, you're gonna have to shut
that down.
Because that was that was my
voice from.
A minute ago. OK, just, just
mute them all, OK.
OK.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Chairman, uh, I think, I
think you get the gist of my
question.
Thank you. I'm gonna defer to my
expert witness, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you very much, uh,
Representative Murphy, uh,
Chairman McQueen, um, so
basically the, the bill
basically would go by the
actual.
property.
So,
I'm, I'm having a hard time
hearing you, so I imagine people
at home are you're gonna have
to, you gotta get in front of
you, OK, so, um, uh, Chairman
McQueen, representative Murphy,
so the bill is based on the type
of property. So if you're
working at home, as you noted,
as many do, including myself,
that would qualify for
residential and not for
commercial.
Mr. Chairman, thank you very
much. um.
I
As a fiscal conservative, I love
tax credits, um, and a lot of
tax cuts even more and tax
deductions, uh, maybe last, but
um.
When, when I look at that and
consider the impact, how will
this, how will this impact the
average Mexican and and and.
This is my concern.
Um
Roughly, I, I believe that the
individual average income in the
state for an individual is
roughly 300 or $32,000.
The family is about double that,
60, 62, 64, somewhere in that
range.
And these systems are pretty
expensive, I would guess. Um,
you're providing up to $6000
worth of credit, 40% of actual
costs, my understanding.
And I have to ask myself,
How many of the average New
Mexicans are really
Um, going to go to these
systems, uh, will they take 10
or 15% of their income and
invest in it.
And it's a tax deduction really
the right approach when we're
looking at the average New
Mexican.
Or is there another approach
such as a low income grant
program or something like that
that might make more sense. OK,
um,
Chairman McQueen and
Representative Murphy, thank you
for that question. So one of the
reasons why you have a tax
credit, it's incentivize the
adoption of newer technologies,
and this has been true for for
decades and this is no
exception. And so the the idea
would be that people who can
afford to take advantage of that
would be the early adopters and
one of the reasons, quite
frankly why it is a significant
tax credit of 40% is to um
Enable people of more moderate
means to take advantage of that.
No, I, I, and I appreciate that,
Mr. Chairman, um, I, I, I
appreciate that, um, but I think
that makes my point, and that
is, is that really this will be
uh primarily utilized by high
income families and individuals
because only they can afford it.
If you take a, um, average, uh,
New Mexican family making
$60,000 they're gonna pay
roughly at most, probably around
$3000 in state taxes, roughly
5%, and people can argue a
little bit one way or another
but I think that number's pretty
close.
So,
Could they really offset their
true tax burden. Now, if they're
paying 15% or 20% of a federal
rate.
Then perhaps it would make some
sense. It probably totally
offset that that tax, but I keep
going back to, does this really
target the average New Mexican
or isn't this really for higher
income people.
who probably need it at least.
Um, Representative Murphy,
Chairman McQueen, um, first of
all, we hope that as many people
as possible can take advantage
of the tax credit in the bill
does specify a rollover.
provision. So you can roll it
over for up to 5 years. So if
you have smaller amount of tax
liability, you should be able to
still take advantage of it.
Great. It's still, it's still
though begs, begs the question
if they can afford it in the
first place, correct?
Um, I'll answer that by that
it's true for a lot of things,
including energy storage.
2 more quickly. Um.
This, this goes to once again to
the average in Mexican and and
the goal of this body and all of
us I think to promote more
affordable housing.
And um one of my concerns it's
probably something that you all
have looked at and considered,
but I appreciate some feedback
on this.
My understanding is some of
these battery systems and mainly
I've seen them in cars, so I'm
not familiar with this complete
technology.
Uh, what's if you have a house
that catches on fire or there's
they can burn.
And keep burning. They're very
difficult to put out.
So,
What does this do to insurance
rates?
Uh, how does that impact, um,
perhaps the goal of promoting
more affordable housing for in
the state.
A representative Murphy, um,
Chairman McQueen, thank you very
much for that question. Uh,
quite honestly, I'm not an
expert on insurance, so I don't
know how to address that, but as
was referenced in the public
comments, there are new energy
codes to update that, and there
are a lot of safety features
right now in electric vehicles
in energy storage and the
concept of lithium-ion
batteries, which is most of what
these would be, is not new. I
mean that technology exists in
our cell phones, our laptop,
computers.
uh, power tools, so it's, it's.
You know, it's not 100% safe but
very safe.
Mr. Chairman and uh
And thank you, uh, let's see, I,
I guess one more question and
this also goes to sort of the
average New Mexican. So let's
say that you have, my
understanding of how the rates
are determined is based upon how
many people are using these
things they're using or hooked
up to the utility.
So, if you have some people.
That have adopted this
technology probably in if you
um.
except my assumption, higher
individuals, higher income
individuals or families that
adopt this technology.
The rate, their effective rate
will actually go down, right?
Because you're storing on that,
that energy is essentially free,
any energy they're pulling from
the grid, their overall rate
will go down as a adopter of
this technology.
What happens to those that can't
adopt it, won't that force?
Normal electric uh electrical
rates up.
And hurt the average New
Mexican?
Um, Representative Murphy,
Chairman McQueen, thank you for
that question. So,
The future of
Where we're going with
electrical generation is my
observation is we're actually
gonna be short of generation due
to the adoption of electric
vehicles, building
electrification, data centers.
So I think this is actually
going to help that situation.
The bottom line is we need more
generation, more generation that
comes in variable resources like
solar, we're gonna need to have
energy storage.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I agree
with that last one, is how we
get there. Thank you.
Thank you, Representative
Montoya.
Um, thank you, Mr. Chair. um,
and briefly, Mr. Chair, um,
there were several questions in
the last uh discussion.
Uh, that were kind of tax
policy, which probably wouldn't
normally deal with here, but
had a feeling that bill was not
going to go to the tax
committee, so, so there, there
might have been a longer
conversation about equity and
some things like that. So just,
just so you're fully aware,
that's probably why that
conversation went a little bit
longer.
But I do expect this bill to go
to the tax committee. So I'm
going to reserve those
questions.
Uh, for the tax committee, uh,
just more of a comment to to
follow up on Representative
Murphy's comments, um, this,
this does
Uh, seem to be that the that the
poor.
Particular, um,
Will not be able to take
advantage of this, so a middle
class and wealthier folks will
be able to take advantage of it
and just that standpoint.
I have a hard time with it, but
I, I, I'll, I'll address tax
questions in the next committee.
Um, I, and once again, I know
we're running a little over and
so uh I'm gonna keep this really
to to one question and, and
frankly, um, Mr. Djor Deidre
Jane.
C. Jarddane, sorry.
Um, I would like to have
In the next committee, uh, I
would like a better answer
concerning uh insurance.
And the reason is, um,
It has been brought up, uh, that
a battery fire of that size, you
can't put out that battery. You
cannot put that out by
Even putting it in water, that
continues to burn.
Um, and I know, uh, obviously
we've been watching California
Burn.
And prior to that disaster in
California, insurance companies
pulled.
Out. So a lot of those folks.
Completely uninsured. So I, um,
once again, Mr. Chair, this is
just a, just to prepare for the
next, for the next committee. I
would like to have a better
answer on that cause I, I would
like to see what insurance.
At least currently.
Uh, if they're addressing this,
if they're looking at this as a
concern, cause one thing we
don't want is in an effort to
protects the environment in an
effort to uh be more
self-sufficient. We don't want
to see somebody's
home go up in flames if that
happens over and over with the,
with batteries.
I, I, I can see homes not being
insurable. I see people then
pulling out the systems.
So that they can have insurance.
So I, I'd like to address that.
So, uh, that's all I have, Mr.
Chair, just for the sake of
brevity.
Uh, Representative Montoya, I
always appreciate for the sake
of brevity, uh, representing
Senator Cortez.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I have one question I know
Representative Montoya wanted to
wait for his tax and rev
committee, but I'm not going to
be in that committee, so I do
have a question about tax
policy. Can you explain how this
is good tax policy.
Mr. Dejardin, did your mic come?
Oh, no, no, OK.
Sorry, thank you. Um, so as I
was saying, representative
Cortez, I believe it's good tax
policy because essentially we're
investing in the future. And so
as this industry grows and it's
predicted to grow many times in
the next 10 years or so. I think
it'll be good for New Mexico and
also the economic development,
the jobs, and all that comes
with that is going to be
contributing taxes to the state
of Mexico.
Well, I have a comment that will
preface my next question. Um,
both tax and rev department and
then energy, minerals and
natural resources department,
they recognize in their
respective analysis that tax
subsidies do not align with
sound talks, uh, with sound tax
policy principles because.
And there's 33 reasons. They
distort economic behavior. They
cause market distortions and
then they create winners and
losers by giving one group a
competitive advantage.
Over the other. So
Are you concerned about?
Distortions in the economic
behavior and in the market.
Cheering the Queen
representative Cortez, um, I, I
read that analysis, quite
frankly, I came to a different
conclusion, but I think there
Concern was more short term and
I think what we're trying to do
here is incentivize an industry,
um, and get it going and as I
mentioned, our decoupling of
energy storage with solar
systems in New Mexico is far
behind uh pretty much all the
other states. So we're trying to
set up the industry so that it
can contribute in taxes and
other ways to the state of New
Mexico.
Are you concerned with equity
equity in the energy sector.
OK, well, I'm quite frankly, I
mean, that's equity is a kind of
a tricky question. I mean, on a
personal level, I am concerned
about equity, um.
And of course, we want to have
Outcomes for all people in, in
our industry.
Chair, I would ask, I would add
on section uh or subsection B,
page 2 in the
In the it's not a definition,
but in the.
Um, if you're asking about
equity and and where we are
moving with this, you will see
all the added benefits for not
just for.
Um, installation for
non-residential property,
including commercial,
industrial, agricultural
property, making sure that we
are covering a lot of bases to
this bill.
Um, since we are on the topic of
equity, I ask you to go through
the chair.
Mr. Chair, thank you.
Chair, since we are talking
about equity.
And you guys are concerned about
equity. Would you be willing to
make an amendment and provide
tax credits for other sectors in
energy since you are concerned
about that.
Mr. Chair, what other sectors
would you be referring to? Oil
and gas.
Mr. Chair, I think that through
our um our the act that we have
in place for oil and gas and
other and those uh those types
of industries they're not
included in here, but they
already have a substantial um
benefits that we that they
already give to them. Thank you,
Mr. Mr. Chair, if I may make one
more comment before closing. Um,
I do want to just reiterate it's
important not to create winners
and losers in the market by
giving one group a competitive
advantage over the other and I
just
As that in the future you
consider making it equitable.
Thank you so much, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, um, representative.
Henry.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just have
a couple of quick questions.
Mine's on the life expectancies
of these battery packs.
What, what do we, when they,
when they are installed, what
happened?
How
Um
Chairman McQueen, Representative
Henry, thank you for that
question. Um, the life
expectancy does vary, uh believe
a typical warranty on a
Battery that you would have for
the type of vets we're talking
about would be about 10 years or
10,000 kilowatt hours, but again
it
The life expectancy can vary
depending on how you use it like
a lot of things.
Mr. Chair, so I'll have 2
questions off of that. The first
question is, what happens to the
batteries after they're done.
What, where do they get disposed
of?
The second question I have to
that would go back to what what
some of the other
representatives have talked to.
When you have a family that had
to use the subsidies to actually
get the system installed. Once
that battery has come to end of
life, what happens to that
system? How do they keep that
system alive.
Chairman McQueen represent
Henry, thank you for that
question. So battery technology
as it's
were referring to it relatively
new and we're in the process of
working that out our national
counterparts of solar energy
Industry Association is working
on that issue, but I would also
suggest that the topic of cradle
to grave. In other words, how we
dispose of products whether it's
this microphone or laptop
computers is is something that
does need work on in our
industry is very involved in
doing that.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I, I, I.
I would like to continue on that
and understand where we're going
with the cradle to grave because
we're seeing it in California,
the solar panels that are coming
to end of life, they're having a
hard time disposing of them. I
just want to make sure that as
we are growing in industry or
trying to, uh, which I, I
totally understand it and, and,
and makes complete sense to me.
But I want to make sure we don't
have unintended consequences on
the back end to where a.
We don't have anywhere to store
the, the used.
Used our product at the end, but
then also I want to go back to
my second question of what
happens to that family that had
to have the subsidies to even
get the system installed.
If it only lasts, let's call it
10 years, just as a rough
number.
What happens to them? How do
they keep their system hold.
Chairman McQueen, Representative
Henry, so
I think you had 2 there you
wanted to go back to what we do
with the product when it's done.
Yes, Mr. Chair, the two
questions I'm still looking to
to answer is, I understand y'all
are making advancements, but as
we see again, like I'm gonna
refer to once again California
with the solar panels the end of
life. They don't have anywhere
to take those now that they're
they've kind of been used. I
want to make sure that we're
thinking ahead, so that when
that does come, if it's only 10
years away, that's really not
very long, um.
What are we doing to make sure
that we have taken care of that
issue or or what, what, uh
direction are we going with
that? The second part that I'm
really, really interested in is
how do we make sure that family
Continues to be able to use
their system once the subsidies
are gone, and in 10 years their
system no longer.
No longer works, I guess. I,
I'm, I'm kind of new to this, so
y'all help me what that looks
like when when the system is is
end of life.
Chairman McQueen, uh,
Representative Henry, thank you
again. So going back to solar
panels in California. I know the
solar industry in New Mexico
pretty well. I read about it in
California. I do know there is a
place in Arizona that's in
business and their sole business
is recycling of solar panels and
there's kind of two things you
can do. First of all, they take
the valuable part, parts of that
solar panel and they recycle
them. So they, you recycle as
much as you can. And then after
That it, you know, you, you
dispose of the remaining
contents and I'm assuming
something like a landfill.
Um, and I from what I would
think you're gonna see a similar
thing with batteries, but again,
this is an evolving um area and
for the homeowners.
I, I
You know, what are they going to
do when, when that product is no
longer functioning, is that
your, your, your question, um.
presumably they would do.
The same thing they would do if
an appliance in our house is no
longer functioning or an
automobile, they would, they
would replace it and by the way,
in 10 years from now, it is that
this technology would be
significantly less expensive.
And, and I would just say one
more thing that during that 10
years, there's a lot of
functionality that they'll
receive out of that battery
whether it's resilience, whether
it's being compensated for for
dispatch to the grid. There's a
lot of services that were
recognizing that a battery can
do and that would provide
compensation for that family, so
hopefully it will be a
worthwhile investment for them.
Thank you
Mr. Cha, that there, there is a
growing rebu recycling industry
has noted and what you're
talking about and what is
happening, we don't have the the
laws or we haven't looked at the
legislation here for uh robust
um circular economic development
uh with recycling and and use of
these types of products, but it
is coming and it's here. Thank
you.
Mr. Chair, last question is, is
I'm gonna kind of dig into this
a little bit because I don't, I
guess this is a statement to to
some extent. My understanding is
lithium batteries cannot go to
landfills at this point. And if
we're going to exponentially
grow this by trying to get them
installed again, don't disagree
with that. Um, I just want to
make sure that we are
Working fervently to understand
what that's gonna happen. The
second statement I'm gonna make
is going to go back to what
Representative Murphy, and I
can't remember which other
representatives said.
If we are asking families to
install this.
In 10 years when it, when it's
end of life.
We're hoping that at that point
it becomes more affordable, but
if they're struggling to get it
installed at the front, I would
really hate for them to be
utilizing their system for 10
years, and then in 10 years, the
system failed. So I just wanna.
Understand kind of how that
would work.
Um, how we make sure to keep
those families whole and safe
and continuing to use a system
that
Within that 10 years, they
probably have become very
reliable on and hopefully have
seen great benefits from. So
that would be all I say, Mr.
Chairman. Thank you.
Thank you for that. Uh, anyone
else on the committee?
Um, so I would just, I would
just add.
I do have some heartburn or
attacks
approach.
Um, we, we used to talk about
the Swiss cheese effect. Uh, we
seem to be headed back in more
holes in, in.
Into things rather than fewer.
So I, I'm concerned about that,
but I also think this kind of
tax credit is intended to, uh,
you know, increase absorption of
the technology, yeah, and it
becomes more common in the
future.
Uh, is there a motion from the
committee?
Mr. Chair, I move to pass.
Esmond we have a do pass as
amended, that's the proper
motion. Thank you. And the
second.
Um
Nina, can you take the vote?
Representative Abeda.
Yes, Representative Cortez.
And that Senna Cortez please and
no.
Representative Dixon.
Yes.
Representative Garcia. Yes.
Representative Carolla, yes.
Representative Henry.
No
Representative Montoya.
No, and I'd like to have just a
brief comment at the end.
Representative Murphy.
No.
Representative Small.
Vice chair, said I.
Chair McQueen
Yes.
OK, you have a due past 6 to 4
represent Montoya to explain
this vote.
Um, Mr. Chair, more of just a
comment, uh, maybe.
We asked the waste isolation
plant to
Expand and start storing lithium
batteries might be a big
business in the future.
Rosan the we isolation by the
plant already has a problem with
fires, so we might not want to
add to that, um, so that's it
for today. Uh, we have been
excused from the floor, but I
would encourage everyone to head
down when they get a chance, um,
thank you very much for your
adjourn.
Is the agenda
