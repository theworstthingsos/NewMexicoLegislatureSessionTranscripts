the official aroma of New Mexico

to our agriculture and other
kinds of things and I think

types of things.

so exciting to have the right
elementary students take part in
their state and participate in
what it's like to form until to
stand up on behalf of the bill
and this is really what this is
about and you need to be able to
do more of this of course they

smile and just a comfort to be
too many New Mexicans I stand in
support thank you thank you
thank you anybody want to make
comment about opposition do we
have anybody in online.
I don't believe so madam chair
in even in public comment.
Okay so we will go to Egypt
Committee o'neill
thank you madam chair just a
question just for context.
As any other state and are you
have official Rama.
Did you all hear the question is
whether states have an official
role.
you madam chair.
Is.
I think you're comes one of our
experts.
Please go ahead when we have you
unmuted.
I think now being.
Just right now menu.
It was.
Okay so right so we will be the
first state going down this road
I'm very excited that thanks and
thanks to your panel for
presented thank you thank you
senator Munoz Senator Griggs.
Madam chair general nutrition
the need to.
I think it's a great Senator
Ivey Soto I thank you very much
of Madam chair so I guess my
question distances New Mexico is
a big state and while I.
Completely understand the the
the rum of crucial roasting in
the fall.
As being an official from of New
Mexico I guess I'm wondering if
if perhaps we should include
the smell of money in southeast
New Mexico created.
for it we should include the the
spell some of the areas that we
have in New Mexico or other
industries that can be rather
aromatic.
Yes or students like to respond
to that comment about whether
the smell of oil and gas should
be included in your the problem
with the smell of their what
would you all think.
Senator.
Like to address that for you
please.
The reading.
Hey girl.
Reinsurance should be that there
are because no matter where you
go New Mexico you're going to be
snowing range early but other
states or other
Other areas in New Mexico.
They they don't have is more of.
Our calendar and.
Working in the is everywhere
like if you were to go to all
workers you will be able not
that it is
you go there you will be able
and all of the that I would not
be able to help out.
Thank you.
The lots of people might
consider the smell of cal's
we're going over or extensions
of interim.
There's certainly no and I and I
appreciate of the young man's
answer to the question it really
is a statewide aroma and so
thank you because it's been.
Senator sent to you to Senator
thank you thank you madam chair
things thank you
I think it's a great idea of
Senator Ivey Soto said all the
false narrative of the rules in
the Chile and maybe we can have
some time or look at the spring
smell of the fresh cut off off
of wherever you go in New Mexico
that is another smell that I
mean I grew up with chilly out
of off of those are the two best
smells.
In the world.
How dare you to that's not the
greatest.
I stay away from my brother's.
But no this is a great deal
thank you centers goals for
bringing it but that fresh cut
off awful and green Chile is the
you can go anywhere else in the
world is as you know you're in
New Mexico.
So I'm just recalling thank you
madam chair thank you senator
Sanchez I have a couple
questions.
Why is it just going to be
surely there differences between
green chili red chili family of
I know we have jalapeno bombers
and stuff like that can you
comment on the broadness of it.
So experts did you hear the
question.
While the smell of chili roasted
not the smell of it goes or
red chili or other kinds.
I would like to answer that for
you.
okay.
I think that
we're not we were drinking the
Kool for having a lot for having
different before they kind of
get into in the cafeteria very
but.
Also along with what it is all
for voting the statewide rate
increases sure it'll help
more of our partner retailers
I don't have a lot and with the
increase of of the product and
with the with this new role more
it will increase jobs and help
with the funding.
It'll it'll increase and this
make lacked a lot better thank
you madam chair.
Thank you
you senator solves many of the
questions from any of the
members.
What is the pleasure of the
committee.
I'm going to pass we have a
motion to do fast by Senator
Sanchez and the second by
Senator Ivy Soto Julio would you
please call the roll Senator
Griggs yes.
Senator Ivey Soto yes.
Senator Sanchez yes.
Senator o'neill yes.
Senator Pinto yes.
Million five to zero in
opposition Senator souls you
have the force bill one eighty
eight thank you and I might
point out thank you to the
bottom of the FIR over it starts
the state run we could not
visitors away from Colorado
which for some reason things it
has potentially comparable to
that of.
Get to the office I'm sure had a
wonderful time.
Different regional.
During the trading Committee and
much appreciated thank you
losses thank you thank you for
joining us.
Okay in our next item on the
agenda is Senate bill one
fifteen multimedia at the at
Hispanic cultural center Senator
Campos thank you very much thank
you very much chair members of
the committee and of course this
is an appropriations bill S. is
for five hundred thousand
dollars to go from the general
fund to the Hispanic cultural
division of cultural affairs
department for expenditure in
fiscal year twenty four to
purchase equipment
on your appointment internet
radio some stage video visual
and related equipment for
multimedia facilities at the
national Hispanic cultural
center and an instance madam
chair members of the committee
as we continue to build if you
will of the multimedia system
throughout New Mexico at the
Hispanic cultural center of this
would definitely assist in a
couple of things the first would
be at a teaching moment and and
secretary.
Is a system will continue to get
the word out if you will in
terms of interviews are cultural
events and the kind of things
that definitely involved around
this type of media so in essence
madam chair members of the
committee that's what this bill
would do.
Thank you Senator Campos and up
to the audience do we have
anybody in support of the bill.
Do we have anybody in
opposition.
Students have anybody online I
know madam chair with.
In the public.
The public
anybody from Senator o'neill
this thank you madam chair and
just really support this bill
the Spanish cultures freeways
but they can do.
And we're not really tapping
this fall tencel so I think it's
really important that we we have
pass this bill and move it on to
the August LESC thank you.
Any other questions or something
Senator Griggs thank you madam
chair center of your FIR talks
about capital outlay and then
probably the the junior bill
more you might be able to
addresses shellfish this well
when we went to the junior bill
few years.
Trying to get away I think
shovels.
These I.
State General financial plan.
The last few years the work was
a junior bill did you see
A substantial
bills continued to be brought
forward in the in the act.
For where you're a decline
because of the the June bill
proper so thank you very much
madam chair and of course
integrates in terms of the
appropriation process with
supplemental appropriations act
referred to as a junior bills in
essence the intent is to go and
work with that specifically for
nonrecurring programmatic issues
but we continue to see however
is the request if you will for
equipment and things are going
to be related on a one time
expenditure basis so we have not
seen the decline yet but I
anticipate with the on board
regulatory pieces that we do put
out
be specific as to how these
resources should be spent I
would anticipate that this will
be one of the issues that would
not be included within a junior
bill four of those six.
Madam chair Senator.
One of the things you
Representative are usually
employees
how will that how will that be a
call so again.
Madam chair where Senator Griggs
in terms of anything that would
be appropriated let's say for
example through June.
That would be nonrecurring with
the understanding if any of the
resources were to be used for
either contractual or NXT
position that would only be for
one year for a short period of
time given given if you will the
institution opportunity either
to incorporate that inculcates
that within their system or if
you will provide additional
grant money of to put someone
into that position I I may also
add that within this they're
already experts within the
Hispanic cultural center
organization that would help to
correlate if you will the
filming and production of
several of the simple
secretaries are going to be
going on there already but with
the FTE itself the understanding
very directly is that this would
not be a recurring expenditure.
Thank you madam chair intention.
Any other questions from
committee members addressed
We have a motion to do that
space Senator Ivy Soto in the
second place and.
Believe that you please call the
roll.
Senator Griggs.
Senator Ivey Soto yes.
Senator Sanchez yes Senator
o'neill yes.
Senator yes.
With a vote of five to five in
favor of opposition Senate bill
