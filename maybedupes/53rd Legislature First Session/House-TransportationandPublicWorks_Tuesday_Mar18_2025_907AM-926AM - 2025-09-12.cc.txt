Yeah.
Et
de la Cruz,
yeah
Good morning, everyone. We only
have license plate bills this
morning. We do have a member
that is present that can present
a bill for now. I did text
everybody that's on the list, so
that they would be aware that
there was their license plate
bills this being heard this
morning.
Uh, with that being said,
Representative Bolego, did you
want to go first? We have nobody
else here to present.
So.
Let's wait a minute, wait a
minute.
Here he is
Testing time, Senator.
Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee, I bring forward a
Senate bill that would introduce
the lowrider capital of the
world license plate bill. And so
for a long time, people from
Espanilla Valley are often asked
where we say where we come from,
if we've heard the latest
espanola joke. We don't want to
hear it.
And when I, you hear me say on
the Senate floor that I
represent the lowrider capital
of the world where we're brown,
we're down and we're low to the
ground, and people chuckle, but
kids in the valley pick their
little heads up because they can
relate to a senator who relates
to their subculture of low
riding. What this film would do
is shine a light on the
community that needs a win, a
community that needs to know
that they're respected, that
their culture is respected, and
so it's not only in the espanola
that we have low riding gets
across the state of New Mexico.
You'd be amazed how many people
have reached out from every
corner of the state in support
of this bill. Lowrider clubs,
enthusiasts, so much so that an
article was written and
published in South China
regarding the bill. This will
bring tourism to New Mexico and
shines a light brightly on here,
and you all may be getting a
lower capital of the world, uh,
t-shirt before the session is
over. And with that, I'll yield
to my co.
Mr. Chair, um, uh,
representatives, I'm honored to
be here to sit next to the
senator to present this bill.
Um, I just drove in from
Espanola, by the way. My mom
lives in Espanola, um, you know,
there's a lot of really
beautiful people who live in
Espinola, and it's sort of
gotten a bad rap over the years,
and I'm really proud to just sit
here and present this with uh
with my co-sponsors.
Thank you and uh, are you ready
for questions?
OK. Is there anyone in the
audience in favor of this bill?
Is there anyone online in favor
of the bill?
No German.
Is there anybody in opposition
to the bill in the audience?
Is there anybody online in
opposition to the bill?
No, chair.
Member questions?
Representative Romero.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you all for bringing this
forward. Actually this is one of
the bills that my dad has been
asking me about, because my dad
grew up in Chimayo and had low
riders, and so he was
particularly interested in this
and my interest in cars, not so
much low riders, unfortunately,
but, um, still have an
appreciation and I'm one on the
committee as chairman and
everybody knows that I'm an
automatic yes on license plates,
so I'm glad you brought this
forward. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair,
represented by the 2 Excel shirt
for your dad to take back. All
right, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you so much, Senator.
He'll, he'll certainly
appreciate it.
Thank you, Representative.
Representative Doll.
Mr. Chair and Senator, I, I have
soresentative Romero has a
always vote yes on license plate
policy. I have always vote no on
license plate policy, but every
single license plate that comes
up, I love the cause. I love the
first like I need to just like.
Change my policy, um, does this
one have the amendments on the,
the sunset, uh, the, the, the
one that we've been seeing
lately on the
If they don't get used or
there's not enough public
center.
Uh, representative, uh, I mean,
Mr. Chair Representative, it
does, and I can't remember the
date cause I forgot my file with
me, but it does have that.
Although I do see that this is
going to be a popular place, uh,
when the legislation was being
drafted, we asked also include
tow trailers because Lowrider
clubs put their cars on trailers
that they're gonna be shipping
their their vehicles to for
lowrider shows. So I think it's
going to be a popular place.
And Mr. Chair and Senator
Representative, does it, where
did the proceeds go?
Mr. Chair representative they'll
go to um the department of
Cultural Affairs, and then will
be used for grants for museums
that will do lowrider exhibits
that we'll talk about the
history of low riding in New
Mexico.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Senator. Thank you,
Representative.
Represent ranking member Brown.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and
good morning.
I wonder why it's taken so long
to get this plate.
I know that low riders are very
popular. I think they're
fascinating.
And I was just curious, uh, Mr.
Chair, Senator Representative,
do you know how many low riders
we have in New Mexico, just a
good guess.
Mr. Chairman Representative, I
wish I knew how many. I just
don't. Um, Mr. Chairman, uh,
maybe someone can answer. I
don't know. Um.
Is there any kind of special
licensing that has to happen for
low riders, I assume not.
Mr. Chairman, representative,
good question. There isn't any
special licensing, but I do want
you to know that northern New
Mexico College is trying to work
on getting their first electric
car lowrider, and they'll be
teaching students how to soup up
a car with electric vehicles and
will be teaching that part of
mechanics at Northern New Mexico
College, if we ever go in that
direction.
Well, Mr. Chairman, and Senator
Representative, I would expect
every lowrider owner to get one
of these bits. It, it just so
goes together, but thank you for
bringing it, um, Mr. Chair, a
few years ago, I ran a series of
license plates that I thought
were emblematic of New Mexico.
The green chili plate was one of
them.
Uh, but the year I brought the
whole, I think it was 12 plates.
Um
Uh, it was, it, it didn't go
anywhere, but I thought we'd
better bring back the chili
plate, uh, the next year and and
at least try to get that one
through. And um it's a popular
plate now. I think this one's
gonna be very popular, even if
you don't own a lowrider. So, uh
thank you for bringing it and I
will definitely support it.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
So ranking member, you're
responsible for the chili plate.
That is beautiful. I have one
for sure.
So, uh, I like to share with
people that I was, my first car
was a low rider, still have a
low rider pickup.
Uh, back in my time, I, I like
to also say that low riders
didn't do tricks.
All they did was be low and
slow. That was it. Nowadays they
have hydraulics and airbags and
on and on.
And so it is a very Mexican
thing, back in my time, my first
writer, I couldn't afford to do
anything but put cement bags in
the back of the trunk just to,
so it would be.
It was slow and it did go slow.
It was a 1964 Impala.
And uh I was really proud of
that car. I can show you
pictures. Uh, so what is the
will of the committee
and representatives, I can vouch
for that because we went to
college together.
Do you remember my low rider,
don't you? OK. What is the role
of the committee? I'll do pass,
Mr. Chairman. We have a motion
by Representative Romero.
We have a second by ranking
member Brown. Please call the
roll.
Representative Armstrong.
Representative Gorigo.
Yes.
Representative Brown.
Representative Do. No.
I'll.
Representative Fernandez.
Representative Hockman B Hill.
Representative Jones.
Yes.
Representative Lindstrom.
Representative Romero, yes.
That one.
Yes, de la Cruz. Yes, 81.
have a due pass, uh, center, why
don't you stay there? I think
you have another bill. Let's
just move yours right away.
I
I just, uh, offer that we take
representative Dow and the
lowrider soon. I think she'll
change her boat.
Mr. Chair, I, my first vehicle
was a '73 Jeep J 10. It was
high, but it did go slow.
Senators, when you're ready.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um,
This is another license plate
bill.
But what I've been saying all
session is, it is unlike all the
other license plate bills.
In 2023 we the legislature
adopted the look twice for
motorcycle safety license plate.
And this is what it looks like.
It is, it was brought to
Representative Chandler and
Senator Harmio from the
motorcycle community in their
districts who are really excited
about it, who helped design it,
and we have him here also.
But what was missing in the 2023
bill was the motorcycle sized
plate.
Which is what the biking
community really wants. And so
all this bill is doing is
allowing for this plate to be
designed and sold at this size.
And that's all.
And I don't know if you want to
add anything center, but that
will stand for questions.
Thank you. I think you're on
amendment.
We should definitely not have an
amendment. You do not have an
amendment.
Never mind,
never mind. Is there anyone, is
there anyone in the audience in
support of this bill?
If you would like to speak,
please line up behind the
presenters.
OK. Do we have anybody online in
support of the bill.
No, Mister Chairman.
Do we have anybody in the
audience in opposition to the
bill.
Anybody in opposition online.
No, Mister Chairman.
Thank you.
Remember questions.
Ranking member Brown.
Thank you very much, uh, Mr.
Chair and senators. I, I don't
really have a question, just
give you a little tiny story.
Years ago, we had a state
employee, uh, in a, who was
involved in a motorcycle
accident.
And he passed away. He worked, I
think, for Department of Health,
and we, his widow asked me if we
could do something to help
people know that they need to
look twice for motorcycles.
Yeah, cause, you know, they're
not as visible as uh
No, you know, regular vehicles
and so Mr. Chairman, I
Worked with the uh county of
Eddy Public Works Department and
we were able to put up a a motor
we actually designed a
in conjunction with the
The NDOT of traffic sign at the
location where he was killed.
And um it meant a lot to his
widow that we did this, I just
trying to let other motorists
know to be really careful and
look for these, these bikes, so,
um, I support what you're doing.
I think it makes perfect sense
to have the smaller version, so
I really do support. Thank you.
Thank
Uh
I love this concept, uh, it's
just really extending it to a
very needed category of vehicle,
which is a motorcycle, as a
lifelong motorcyclist, I can
tell you that I have actually
lost friends in accidents too,
specifically.
13 years ago.
Uh, and so
The notion of having people
recognize and be more aware of
motorcycles, motorcyclists.
Those machines are very
unforgiving.
So if you cut a motorcycle off
or you hit a motorcycle where
you stop to abruptly, it just
creates lots of danger.
So I appreciate this uh signal
for questions, what is the will
of the committee?
We have a motion by.
Leader Armstrong and a second by
ranking member Brown.
A roll, please.
Representative Armstrong, yes.
Representative Borigo
Representative Brown, yes.
Representative Dow? Yes.
Representative Franklin
Hernandez, yes.
Representative Hockman Beto.
Representative Jones.
Yes.
Representative Lindstrom.
Representative Romero.
water
Yes,
yes, you have a new pass.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members
of the committee, 4 more days,
we got this. Keep going strong.
Represent and
no new dude, I can't get that.
You'll have to forgive me, Rob.
And no
Is that right?
That is right. Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Like you got it.
When you're ready, please
proceed.
So, I just want to
Everybody know this bill is much
simpler.
On its face. So, um, TRD has a
policy by which they can um
reject inappropriate
personalized license plate
submissions and um some rejected
plate submissions are being
challenged on our First
Amendment basis and this bill
would simply put TRD in a better
position to um argue those
challenges. So the policy right
now is that personalized license
plates may not be um derogatory,
offensive or misleading.
obscene, vulgar, sexually
explicit or profane, promote
drugs, alcohol, or other
intoxicating substances or
promote gang violence, and they
also can't be um
easily and any plate that is
uneasily differentiated from
another plate can be subject to
um differentiation, so.
If your last name is Ortega and
you want Ortega plate, but
there's already a registered
rotega plate that starts with an
O and you want yours to start
with a 0. You might be rejected
because it's too similar to the
other plate.
So that is, that is it, Mr.
Tarrant. I stand for questions.
Thank you. Anybody in the
audience? I don't think we have
anybody. How about online?
Anybody online?
In support
No, Mister Chairman, anybody in
opposition, anybody in
opposition online.
No, Mister Chairman.
Thank you.
committee questions.
Representative Do.
Mr. Taran Representative, I, I
don't know if anybody saw, but a
Freedom index for small for new
business in New Mexico just came
out and it's pretty dismal. I
think we should probably like we
we've got a rank top of the
nation for our freedom index on
specialty license plates and
letting people do whatever they
want with their license plate.
Representative Lustrom.
Thank you, representative. Do we
have a big problem with this,
uh, are there plates that are
being printed now or we don't
print them, do they get them
printed someplace else and then
put them on the car. How does
that work? Um, no, it's, it's
done through the state. It's
just there have been some
challenges to the rejections and
TRD is just asking for a
stronger tool too.
Combat those challenges when
they arise.
Yeah, I'm seeing some, some
things that are.
I think over the top.
But I think they buy them in
Vegas or something and then put
them on the car. Do we still, do
you know, uh, Mr. Chairman, uh,
Representative, do we allow
front front plates, you know,
and we don't allow front plates
for.
purposes of like for like
legality purposes, it's not like
you're not required to have a
front plate. You can put.
A front plate on your car, so
this would be, this is just in
um regard to like state issued
plates that you're using that
you register with MVD. So if you
bought a vanity plate in Las
Vegas, that's just for fun. You
can still put that on the front
of your vehicle, but this is for
state issued plates. OK, thank
you.
So, uh, representative, this is
actually a department bill.
What is the will of the
committee?
We have a motion by
Representative Dow.
2nd by Representing Borego.
Make a roll, please.
Representative Armstrong, yes.
Representative Gorigo.
Representative Brown.
Representative Dell.
Yes.
Representative Hernandez, yes.
Representative Homan Bell,
Representative Jones. Yeah.
Representative Lindstrom.
Representative Romero? Yes.
your water?
Yes, de la Cruz, yes, members,
uh, we will be rolling HB 507,
uh, we will not hear. There will
be just, please take note that
there will be some bills this
Thursday, so please be prepared
for that.
On Thursday, and we also will
have burritos or if you're
hungry, come hungry.
Thank you, see no further
business we.
Thank you.
