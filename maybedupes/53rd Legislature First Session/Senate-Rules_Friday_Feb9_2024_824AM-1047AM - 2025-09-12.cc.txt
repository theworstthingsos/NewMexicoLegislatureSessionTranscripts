Buddy and Precision.
Hmm. As you know, uh and I
believe that we have the
resources to do this financially
as a state, and maybe more
importantly, we have 33
And the modern
Um and the modern
Um, infrastructure
Enveloped into a single county.
That county commission has the
sole duty to select a
replacement.
If the legislative district
touches has precincts in two or
more counties
Each of those county
commissioners submit
The name or names to the chief
executive, and the governor
makes the appointment.
That's all we have.
I just explained
The Constitution and the statute
to you.
Very plainly. There are no
rules.
There is no procedure. There is
no timelines. There is no
Suggestions so every single
county does it. However, they
want to do it and my home
county. Uh, it's incredibly
troubling. Um
And so I'm gonna have a document
delivered here in a couple of
minutes that that that that
outlines the last 10 or 12
appointments have been about 10
or 12 appointments in the last
10 years.
Uh, by my home county, the
county commissioner, uh,
That envelopes that legislative
vacancy
Ah!
Kind of kind of get kind of
makes the call.
And and when they have two other
votes, they call a meeting and
they accept applications.
Applications are not accepted
When the vacancy occurs. There
is no way to
Two.
To to join the process.
Until there's a press release
sent out.
Which calls for a meeting
normally within a week and and
calls for a procedure to accept
applications.
Um, you know that hometown that
that hometown commissioner has
their two votes, the other two
votes go with them. Why not, and
their replacement is made.
And I don't want to disparage
anybody who's been appointed. I
mean, there's outstanding people
that have been appointed.
There's about four of us that
are currently serving that that
were appointed, and I don't want
to disparage anybody with
regards to that. I look forward
to working with hopefully
working with all of them in the
years to come, but there is no
input by community.
There's no input by
neighborhoods.
There's no input by parties.
Ah, there's no way to weigh in
other than this highly charged
highly political, highly insider
process.
Um And so so, for example, uh,
so anyway.
In this. What This calls for
Madam chair is if if there's a
vacancy
In the after the session or in
the summertime or in the fall.
Then it goes to a special
election and that the special
election shall occur within 60
days of the vacancy or the
impending vacancy.
If there's a vacancy in
Christmas, like, uh,
I think a member passed away
over the Christmas holidays
about five years ago in the
House.
If there's a vacancy that
happens around Christmas time or
in January
Then the county commissioner.
There's no time to call special
election.
So the county commission will
have the same authority as they
do now. However, after the
session, there will be a special
election so that appointment
will only last during the
session. It also contemplates
the situation where
A legislator. Uh, basically a
senator who wins election in
November.
And there's an impending
vacancy. January 1.
That the that the clock starts
then. So, for example, let's say
somebody wins their election
November 5th, for whatever
reason that I want to resign. We
know that they're going to
retire January 1 when they take
higher office. The classic
example is honorable. Tim Keller
sent then Senator Tim Keller
became state Uttar Keller.
Um Everyone knew he was gonna
resign on January 1.
The county commission did a very
smart thing.
They announced a meeting. They
held a process they named
Uh, Senator Keller's successor.
They did a great job.
And then they also named they
named a house member to replace
Senator killer and then they
held a second meeting.
And named, uh, an impending
house replacement. Seamless
great that that that vacancy
occurred on January 1, but the
pending vacancy hand happened
roughly November 5th or so so
that so that if if if it
happens November 6th, then
within 60 days of that impending
vacancy, there will be a special
election.
Um if sir
With your permission answer. So
this just outlines the various
replacements that happened in my
situation. It was it was similar
but handled
Very, very differently.
My predecessor retired roughly
October 15.
There was tremendous, tremendous
tremendous pressure on the
county commission to delay the
vote until January.
It conflicted with fundamental
principles of democracy. Madison
vs Mulberry 1803 the classic
case where of a new government
cannot undo what the previous
government did.
It was. It was reminiscent of
what Mitch McConnell did when
honorable Justice Scalia passed
away in February.
And Mitch McConnell, who
controlled the calendar in the
U. S. Senate, delayed the vote
until January, where President
Trump
Made the appointment not
President Obama and so there was
tremendous pressure to do that.
The county commission, then
institute its very first rule.
Sadly, even though the Berlin
County Commission has made you
know 10 appointments or so in
the past
10 years. They had no rules.
They literally had no rules in
their ordinances.
So they passed a rule that
vacancy had to be filled within
21 days.
The meeting was held.
And and and
And I was appointed.
Why my county commissioner who
was doing everything in her
power to to to not have me get
the appointment.
Not only felt
That there was rude or uncool or
or or not.
Or not.
Collegial for her not to get the
appointment. She literally
believed that she had the moral
and legal authority to make the
appointment.
She literally believed that to
the point where she called a
colleague, the B word and and
Senator, we're not disparaging
people in this commission or in
this in this committee, please.
Thank you. I don't believe I
disparage anyone, but but I was
so let's move on.
Okay, but she called someone A B
word, senator Move on.
They deserve it.
So anyway, to make a long story
short, they there was no rules
in place to deal with those
situations and then the
Constitution manage chair.
Apologize to this committee if I
disperse anyway.
The constitution is clear.
Legislative appointment shall be
Subsequent to the next general
election.
Because there was a change of
government on January 1.
Based on legal advice of the
Of the county attorney.
They didn't follow the
constitution and they appointed
someone for 19 days.
Using the excuse that there was
a redistricting issue, and then
on January 1, they proclaimed a
new vacancy.
And and appointed somebody else.
All these people were awesome
that they appointed anyway. To
make a long story short. This
needs to go to the people.
Uh,
Lastly, what happens when these
vacancies occur. There's so much
Politicking and pressure on the
county commissions that they
can't even do their job
literally drains.
The county commission for weeks
and months on end until that
appointment is made, So I say
Let's let's give the the women
to the people and and and, uh
An end. Uh, this pattern and
practice of arbitrary
government.
Thank you, madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator. We don't
have anyone signed up in support
or opposition on this, Uh, would
anyone in the audience like to
raise their hand to indicate
support?
Would anyone like to raise their
hand to see none. Members of the
committee, Senator Moore. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Thank rural
members might be like, well,
it's an Albuquerque issue.
But it impacts the
When when it happened in the
state Senate.
And what? Really concerned me
about that, as I'm not leaving
12 years later, is we literally
had the process Then it started
to tip for tat. If you, um,
basically took a Republican
teacher and Democrat
And we had a Republican governor
at the time. So previously was
always you try to take the same
political party and work with
you, You know Republican
Martinez administration
retaliated as soon as Phil
Griego was gone. We took a
Democrat district and made a
Republican district. And so it's
those ripples. And I've never
liked that. So I would actually
appreciate your doing include
Something in offer a friendly
amendment if you would, because
what we have with that situation
obviously could have a governor
switch the makeup of a
legislative body.
So you're a twist and the
governor gets to pick up the
political power that is
More than theoretical because it
has happened in our, um so I
would like to on page tune after
Ah filled. The vacancy shall be
filled by a member of the same
political thing else like that.
Uh, Senator? Yeah, I think so.
Senator, Can you restate your
I think and Senator, I think by
the member vacating, perhaps
because they might not be
resigning? Yeah.
Or by the vacating member
member.
Uh, Senator. Thank you. I think
that's a good fundamental
principle. Two points I would
suggest
That they be filled by the
By the the election.
Um, I'm sorry. We didn't clarify
that. This is this is before
before the election at six
months, um, that is still being
filled by by by law. Correct,
Correct, Madam Chair Center.
Moore's book, For example. My in
my district. The demo of
The winner of district 26.
In November of 20 was Democrat.
Yeah.
And your name Democrat Then on
the resignation day was
independent.
I think the proper to appoint
someone from the from the
affiliation of the elected
person, the person I was unaware
of that. So this is the process.
That's right. The way yours has
been.
Because he did switch. I forgot
about that. Yeah, but I think
it's good, fundamental. I think
Let's go through the chair. I
agree that that should be in the
in the enabling statutes, but
I'll defer to the committee if
they want to put it in now.
Well so and and I want to talk
about something structural about
your amendment in second, but so
so you're saying this is
friendly or unfriendly?
Okay, friendly. I believe it
should be in the enabling act,
but
But it's a I agree with the
principle.
Okay? And I would I would have
hoped the committee would as
well we'll go. So is there
Is there a discussion? I have
something I'd like to talk about
on the amendment, but I'll go to
members of the committee on the
Amendment first.
Did you want?
It was the truth. Senator Hurtt
Pinot is giving me a meaningful
look. Okay?
So there's Stuart. Madam Chair.
the amendment to be changed.
Yes.
Sponsor if the sponsor of the
amendment agrees with what does
me I would like to hear what how
you would structurally fix it
because I do a structural issues
here.
Well and so, senator because of
where you're putting it.
It applies to an election, too.
So you are telling the people of
New Mexico? They can so you're
putting it in.
And be there. Oh, no, You're
right. Well, no. Because number
three under sub B says In all
other instances, it filled shall
be filtered in election, but
that language that you just put
in that it has to be someone of
the same political affiliation
applies to that sub C.
If I may, Madam Chair I look at
line Look at Page three, line
four.
Between the words appointment
and until, or I'm sorry between
the words Phil
done exactly what you were
saying it would have done and
and I appreciate what you're
saying, but is saying about the
enabling legislation, But I'm
not gonna be here so
This is my crack at it. And and
and and Senator, they can't hear
you online.
Right. So so it is totally
unclear to me. What what The
actual amendment is at this
point or and what is being
moved. So on Page three line for
after filled
Insert by a member of the same
political affiliation as the
member of the AB. But that
doesn't get you elections.
That's a member of that was
elected.
That's awkward. The election,
right? Okay, I will drop this
issue. Promise me you guys will
add this into the statute. Uh,
Hey, Senator, I make no such I
will. I will drop the
amendments, but I agree with the
principle if you guys will at
least work on it in the future,
and Senator McKenna, were you
wanting to the The amendment has
been withdrawn. Were you wanting
to speak on the amendment or or
on the bill?
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um you
know, I couldn't hear what
Senator Moors and proposed
amendment was, but I understand
it's being withdrawn. Its been
withdrawn. Yes. Thank you,
madam. Thank you, okay.
Uh, other members of the
committee. Oh, wait. Sorry. I
had Senator Hermione. Next book,
not Senator Robert was on
withdrawn Amendment or on the
bill itself.
Okay, then Go ahead. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Uh, it looks like
there's two situations where it
would be appointed.
Based on time, and that's
paragraph one, paragraph two. Is
that correct, Madam Chair that's
correct the last six months of a
term.
Uh,
Or or
Leading up to or during a
legislative session.
So so I would suggest that the
amendment needs to be in both
paragraphs one and paragraph and
senator. The amendments been
withdrawn. No good point.
If he's going to consider for a
future that
That would need to be addressed
in most situations in
Senator harm you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and I
think that this bill senator
makes so much sense for when
you're one county. But when you
look at myself that's multiple
counties were four counties.
Rural New Mexico. Um, we've
gotta move quick and getting an
appointment so in the
commission's and wife or
counties
We coordinate on when that
vacancy will be filled.
And so we did have a vacancy
that we field while I was a
county commissioner and as the
commission the commission
chairs then meet with the chairs
of each other county in the
district.
Applicants are sent into each of
those counties and what we then
plan our Special County
Commission meeting.
So that we don't overlap each
other so that were spread out
with enough time so that I think
it makes sense for a one county.
Situation, but I don't think
when it's a multiple county that
wants to move quick in running
Mexico that the bill would make
sense for us, and so it was just
a comment, But one quick
question. How many days after
the vacancy? Did you say the
election to take place?
Thank you, Madam Chair Center
had a meal and you're right that
there doesn't seem to be
problems in the outer counties,
but it would be a 60 days from
the date of vacancy.
For example, the honorable
Christine Trujillo announced.
Her retirement in early June,
Effective July, 1st.
Nothing would preclude the
The secretary of state or the
county clerk to start planning
the election.
From that announcement.
But it would be 60 days. Okay.
Thank you, Madam Chair. It was
just a comment on that one
Simple question. Thank you.
Thank you, Uh, Senator Stewart.
Came out of the chair.
So who's going to make these
appointments? Now that you're
trying to cut? Thank you, Madam
Chair Senator Stewart in the
senator, Can you pull the mic
closer to you? Thank you, Madam.
Chair, Senator Gorton, people
the electorate.
But not if it's within 60 days
of the session. Oh, thank you,
Madam Chair, Senator, then?
Yeah, for practicality. We do it
the same way we do now.
But you've cut out the county's
ability to do that. In this
amendment just stricken them out
Unless I'm reading this wrong, I
don't believe so many chair
center Stewart if it's if it's a
If it's in December or January
or during the session than the
county commissions would
Would do the appointment. Um
In paragraphs one and two. So
there's two scenarios. Madam
Chair, Senator Stewart.
And so on Page two.
Line 21.
Paragraph one. That's in the
last six months. If someone were
God bless him were to pass away.
Uh, in the last six months of
their term than the county
commissions would make the
appointment, Madam Madam Chair,
Senator Online's 1414, 15 and 16
You remove the county
commissioners from filling the
appointment.
And I don't think you re
inserted that anywhere.
One moment. Thank you.
That was the way it was drafted,
And I think I think I should be
drafted better if you look Madam
Chair Senator Stewart on Page
three.
Line eight.
It says. In all other instances,
the vacancy shall be filled at
an election.
Um
And then in, uh and when you go
to page two line, 23
The vacancy shall be filled by
appointment.
And then you look at, uh
By whom? Madam chair you've
taken out the county commission.
That was not the intent, but it
appears that that could be
interpreted that way. That was
not the intent of the
interpreted you've. You've got
them out of the statute didn't
intentionally cut them out is
what I'm saying. Madam Chair
Center Stewart. That's an error.
I apologize. You might want to
rework this absolutely excellent
point. That was not my intent,
as mentioned.
And Madam Cheryl, just say it.
It's also not in the title
telling, you know the titles.
What
Goes on the ballot. It does not
reference the county commission
at all.
Yeah.
That. Wow. Excellent, Excellent
Catch, Madam Chair Centers tour.
Thank you, ma'am. Chair Senator
to subpoena
Hmm.
Thank you, madam Chairman and
Senator. Another issue that
Strikes me as
Having an election.
60 days after the vacancy or
curs.
On page three lines.
Um
Five and six.
After the session ends, You'll
have another election.
I'm not sure what the point of
that would be, because nothing's
gonna. I mean, there's really no
need.
Until the next session comes up
is there I mean, Essentially, we
only have authority when we're
in session. Other than that,
we're going to interim meetings
educating ourselves, maybe doing
some constituent service. But
it's
What would be What's the rush? I
guess is what I'm saying to have
an election 60 days after the
session ends. Thank you. Thank
you, Madam. Chair, Senator TCP
No.
That would that would be. I
don't know if there would be a
need, but there would be a
desire to have the people
determine their elected
officials. It was taken from the
example in Tennessee Madam Chair
with a
Where the young man was voted
out by his house colleagues. He
was then reappointed.
By the by the county Council
there in Nashville.
But then they still had a
special election Afterward, they
still allowed the people, so
there was a special there was an
appointment.
Which which was necessary so
that the people had to vote
during the session.
It would be necessary and
practical to have that
appointment either leading up to
the session or during the
session. But then it would go to
the people. It wouldn't really
matter in a house seat that
much. But in a Senate seat, that
would be two years
There could be two or three
years, uh, of a
Where the people should
determine their senator, as
opposed to, as opposed to one or
three people.
It's just we have a situation
now with these, uh
Elections every year.
That maybe you just hold it at
the next election.
I mean,
Every note. If it's not a
legislative election, it's where
the county
Where the city municipal and
school boards get elected. We
could tack it onto that just to
avoid the cost of another
election.
The people would still have
their say.
Whoever was appointed isn't
going to do much until we have
another session. So that would
work. I think a little better.
You could just tack it onto the
whatever we call that general
local. Thank you, Madam Chair,
So that's a That's a great idea.
In fact, regardless of whether
this legislation was forward,
there's actually a It's not
really written well.
Uh, as to whether
The senator is then has to has
to run during a house.
Election cycle.
Uh, I think I think I think it's
clear that that the county
commission shall or the governor
shall appoint subsequent to the
next general election.
But is that general election
attached to the senators? Next
general election or the next
general election in general, But
that could be a possibility as
well, I think
The cost is minimal. That
technology is there. The rules
could even call for a mail in
ballot. I just think that
Ah, the more power we give to
the people to determine their
elected officials, the better
I agree. I wouldn't say the cost
is minimal, though we just spent
For one City Council district.
They just had to spend
Runoff election 250,000 so it I
mean, there is a considerable
Hit because they have to have
judges. They open it up. You
know, they hire people.
Early voting all the rest of
that, and I think if you just
tack it onto either the next
general or local election,
whichever, whichever would be
the next one.
It could be the the election.
The position will be filled by
election at the next general or
local, Some wording like that.
And that, uh,
Yeah, definitely. That would
that would be more beneficial
than what we have now, Madam
chair. Thank you, Madam
Chairman. That's all I am.
Right? I don't have anyone else
on the list. Um so, Senator
There.
So other than when Senator
Stewart pointed out about that
we don't know who is vacating or
I mean, who's appointing?
This conflicts with a bunch of
the timelines that we have
throughout our election code.
So so this would be a special
election, which means it would
be done by mail as opposed to it
would be done by mail all
special elections in New Mexico
are male elections.
But
So 60. So, for example.
For special elections. The
proclamation has to be issued 67
days before an election.
So just even just the
proclamation. The thing that
starts it off is already outside
of the time a lot. Some of these
time frames that you're
providing for here.
Uh um.
Also
How would you have a primary and
a general election?
In in some of these time frames
that it just doesn't provide for
it doesn't provide time for
people to get the petition
signatures they would need to
get, um, like there's all these
time frames that we have laid
out through our election code
for a lot of very good reasons.
and this kind of flies in the
face of all of those. Ah,
Which which I think would set a
very dangerous precedent. Um,
for how we administer elections
in New Mexico would be really
burdensome on our county clerks
and would
Result in a lot of confusion for
over voters because we're be
doing totally different
processes for this rather than
other things. Um and I hear what
you're saying about that.
That
There that cannon commissions
have have quite a bit of
discretion about how they handle
these appointments. But that's
still the same for when folks
would be being appointed under
here, even if it did, say county
Commission that wouldn't change
anything. None of that would
change. Under this. They would
still have the same degree of
discretion that they have now in
handling those appointments, so
I don't think it
I don't think it solves the
problem.
That that you've articulated to
us here today.
Um
There's also this language about
the impending vacancy.
Because that's not defined. We
don't know what that means. So
does that mean maybe someone one
election, so we we know they're
gonna be resigning. Or does that
mean someone's really sick and
we think they might die?
Um, we're going to call that an
impending vacancy. There's it
is.
As it to use that have an
undefined term Be
What triggers
Something happening is is not
not really a workable approach.
I think
Um
Uh so I I can't support this, Um
But on there, is there any
What's the will of the committee
on this?
I may. Madam chair when I just
think that think the committee
thank you for the conversation
and the catch. I don't. Uh, this
kind of
I had some PTSD so sorry for
snapping at members. Um, what
happened on on opening day last
year was just categorically
unacceptable and
That stuff can happen again
cannot
What's the will of the
committee?
Okay. We have a motion to table.
Is there any objection to that
motion? Explain my vote.
Alright. So show all members
voting in favor of the motion to
table Senator Morris to explain
his vote, and I agree with you
that something should be done in
the future. I don't think this
is cooked enough. And as we
talked about, I think
So I hope you continue to fight
for this and it just occurred to
me as I'm looking around the
room. Six of the nine of us have
gone through this process at the
in this room right now and that
I don't know if it's right or
good or bad or it's just It's
just an observation. I just
noticed that six of the nine of
us have gone through this.
Let Liz I guess you didn't
actually go through the process.
Your your your predecessor went
through the process. Yeah, but
your your seat was stolen and
you took it back. Yeah, kind of
Commissioner.
Kind of commission, are you? You
don't run on I was I was,
including your okay?
Thanks. Okay. Thank you so much.
So I think we're going to hear
both, um
Okay? Yeah. Alright, Cool. Thank
you, Senator. I think we're
going to hear SJ r. Three and
four together. Senator Lopez and
Senator Tallman. If y'all don't
mind, they're they're very
similar. Think the primary
difference is just a difference
in the
One is 6060 of the others. 4545
So given the similarities, I
thought it would
Makes sense for us to discuss
those bills together. I think
analysis for both of those are
being handed out to the members.
Senators. I'll let you guys rock
paper scissors to decide who
goes right. Go ahead and
proceed. Senators.
Well, thank you. Good morning,
and thank you, Madam Chair and
thank you, Senator Tommy, he
says I get to go first. So, um,
Madam Chair members of the
committee. I sit in front of you
with Senate joint resolution for
And, um, Madam chair. It's It's
high time that we make a change
in the
The way that we do business here
in Santa Fe.
Um from my 10, Europe here and
for a few of us who have been
here for a bit. It's a 30 Day 60
day.
Um
Routine, as I call it is really
doesn't serve the state of New
Mexico anymore.
In 1964. The changes were made
to add the 30 Day.
Um
Because of the issue on budget.
I mean, there's just a lot of
history that goes behind us. But
Madam chair, Essentially a
change has to come where we
Um, can address the concerns
that exist in the state of New
Mexico. We can't wait every two
years to try and address
something.
Yes. You do have the option of
going to the governor. Whoever
the governor maybe to ask for an
iMessage.
But essentially, that doesn't
reflect the will of the people.
And I believe we have to have a
change to propose to, um
To the people to decide. I have
chosen 60 days because it takes
us a while to ramp up to kind of
get into I call the mode. Um
did it also gives us more of an
opportunity for 60 days, She
really have some more discussion
amongst us here in the body.
Working with our colleagues on
the other side of the chamber in
the House.
And vice versa. But it also, I
think reflects the needed
changes. Um, within our state
society is just moving too
quickly, and I've seen it having
to wait two years until
constituents or we have to wait
till next year. Um, and they're
like what? Why? Because you have
to explain the process of 30
days just primarily for budget.
And of course, we have to wait
if the governor seized fit,
whether it's his or her agenda,
and if it's not, then we have to
wait.
So I'm just very simple in that
madam chair and I just hope we
have a fruitful discussion this
morning and committee.
And I hope we do pass something
out. Um, for us to send on
Because the voters need to
understand, of course, but we
need an opportunity to really
address the issues for our
state. And I am I know, Madam
chair there. Maybe I hope some
more discussion as to invite my
colleague here has a 45 day. My
argument. Madam Chair will be
the 60 days gives us more time.
Um, in order to do the business
of a statement or communities.
That's all. Thank you.
Senator Tallman.
Good morning, man. I'm cheering
good morning, members of the
committee.
Thank you for giving us this
opportunity.
Um I have my top four reasons.
Number one.
The
I'm not strongly opposed to the
60 day. I just feel that would
have a better chance of
succeeding at at the ballot box.
So
60 Day session, um, kind of
drags the 30 day sessions too
short.
Even in the 60 days.
Uh, session, we managed to pass
anywhere from 2 to 300 bills.
And
Even and a 60 Day session.
You know, we waste a lot of time
and there's a big flurry of
activity. The last week we got
Make better use of our time.
So I don't see.
That's really accomplishing a
lot more.
Whether we have a 45 Day session
or
60 Day session.
That's number one number two is
obviously is
Senators already mentioned. The
governor doesn't control the
agenda.
And as a
She mentioned that you know you
You have a bill that
You don't get through. You have
to wait two years if it doesn't
have to wait two years to take
action on it. If it's not major
main, or if you want to amend
the bill.
Another reason is, I think the
voters would appreciate the
wisdom of the 245 Day session.
Versus a 30 Day session.
Versus 30 Day Sessions
alternated with, um I just think
it has a better chance of
getting a might be able to think
it has a better chance of
getting, um, having success at
the ballot box.
And, um
Also, I think the voters
Uh,
What would not
The
Two.
Another reason they would not be
able to prove it, because, uh,
They
Would give the lobbyists more
time to
Take the
Legislators out to dinner.
Somebody scoffed at that. I
think it's a
Well, it's a you can take it for
what it is. Is you want, um
At least it shows you're paying
attention, but
Um so
Yeah, I think, uh, in summary, I
think it has a better chance of
succeeding at the ballot box and
that violently opposed the 60
Day.
But again
There's a big flurry of activity
at the end. We waste a lot of
time and I don't think we're
going to accomplish a lot more
than 60 days.
Versus a 45 day. Thank you for
your listening and I look
forward to the discussion.
Thanks.
Thank you. Senators. Uh, don't
have one person signed up in
support of both Australia three
and four. Claudia Risner.
I don't see here in the room
machine online.
Claudia, Go ahead for a couple
minutes.
Yes. Good morning, madam Chair
and committee. Thanks for the
opportunity to speak with you
this morning.
Um I'm speaking on behalf of the
Veterans and Military Families
Caucus, and we are in strong
support of both of these bills,
especially Senator Lopez Bill
that asks for 60 days for each
session. The caucus is in favor
of that, because we think you
can get an awful lot done. We
see how hard you work. We see
the flurry of activity at the
end that Senator Tollman has
brought up
I think the hard work throughout
the entire session. We also
would like to have the
opportunity to speak with the
legislators and work with them
each year, a non budget related
legislation and we don't need to
go through the process that
Senator Lopez, um outlined about
having it being messaged to be
German.
So, um, the caucus has over 500
people throughout the state and
we are very strongly in favor of
the Senate joint resolution for
for these reasons. Thank you.
Great. Thank you. Uh, we don't
have anyone signed up in
opposition. Would anyone like to
raise their hand to indicate
support?
Would anyone like to raise a
hand to indicate opposition?
Alright Members of the
committee, Senator Moore. Thank
you, Madam chair. Thank you,
Senator. Wars. Um, I you had me
at the German this and 3060 or
30 30 45 days. It's just a
matter of what is convenient. 30
days is just too short. 60 days
is too long in my opinion, And
so I like 45. I think that's a
good way to go go about and we
can schedule it every year.
It's uh, it's people are used to
it. We can come up here. We're
not taking too much time away
from our businesses and our
family. I think we can get this
work done in 45, but I like both
of them. But I'll be voting for
45 because I think that's the
Goldilocks Timeframe versus 60
Days, which is a grind for all
of us when we thank you, Madam
Chair, Senator Stewart
Thank you. Thank you, madam
Chair.
So I had a a resolution. Uh,
like Senator Lopez is in the
house. Um, 15 years ago. The
thin
Majority leader, Uh said over
studying this we have a big in
CSL study going on. So I have to
wait till we get the results of
that study so that sales 3535
with the majority leader voting
with the other side.
Uh, So then the study came out
and they said our sessions too
long, and we should extend it to
60 days. So I'm with the 6060.
Yeah. I don't want to spend any
more time up here than
necessary, but we are seriously
not getting work. Done This 30
days we are out of time.
We're out of time now for really
passing any Senate bills over to
the house and we have plenty of
them still in Argentina.
I mean, we have less than a week
and houses doing three hours on
every bill every day.
Every day, three hours on every
bill. So, um, we're gonna see a
lot of death here. Dying of
bills. Um, we're just out of
time. So I much prefer the 6060.
That's what I will be voting
for. Thank you Much chair,
Senator TCP. No, thank you,
Madam Chairman And and the F I,
R brings up an interesting point
on
On the 45 day. That is, we have
another provision in the
Constitution that says you can't
introduce legislation.
After after after 30 days. I
mean, in other words,
Yeah.
And and and
Mhm. It's actually not. It's not
worth it halfway point. I think
the problem is it's worded 30
days.
How does it were you?
Hmm.
It's it's not a constitutional
amendment. It's a statute that
we already have.
We can change statutes.
I forgot.
We don't have enough time. We
can't get him to change his
statue.
Ah!
I do think that that 60 days is
not too long
when we get to the end of the 60
Day session and still have
stacks of stuff that we haven't
even been able to read, let
alone analyzing committee.
Now we might also want to do a
limitation on the bill's
introduction.
And as somebody who typically
introduces way too many bills. I
fully endorse that would love to
be able to say to a constituent.
Oh, I'm sorry. I just gave up my
last bill I can't introduce
anymore.
But I I do think that 67 45 45
just because
Even 45 is going to be really,
really jammed.
Thank you, Senator Hermia. Madam
Chairman is just a comment, But
I also see the 6060. But one
thing that's really hard for me
is I'm juggling a part time job
while being a full time senator.
And so even though that would be
really hard again to go back to
back 6060. I see the benefit in
it, helping my community and the
state of New Mexico when I talk
about bills.
If you think about it the first
two weeks or mostly.
Performers coming on the floor
constituents coming in to talk
about concerns. It's really
about listening those first two
weeks. The 6060 makes sense to
me because then after those two
weeks we get that ball moving,
And then the 30 day you're
almost done. And so thank you,
Madam Chair. I was inclined to
vote for both.
But if we did something, think
that
Members would need a good break
in the middle.
Because, um, for people who live
far away who are away from their
families, etcetera, it is much
different for them and forth.
So I just want us to keep that
in mind, so I'll probably
Bling.
Only madam chair.
The 4545 is certainly something
I would support because it's
just pointed out it. It's
Rough to be gone for, uh, 60
days, particularly if you're
Trying to somewhat in doubt with
with 60 Day session. Certainly
so
You know, I I would favor the
4545 and I would prefer we just
get to work and
We tend to
But everything off till the last
two weeks anyway.
I think if we went to 120 days,
we still put it off to the last
you know, two or three weeks, so
I would prefer people are
But to the grindstone and have
Senator to subpoena for a second
time, actually, like the idea of
the break. I think some
legislators do that, Madam
Chairman. They they have a
Uh, 60 Day session. Maybe you
have to introduce legislation.
all in all legislation has to be
introduced during 30 days. Then
they take a couple of weeks or
three weeks Go home meet with
constituents.
Re introduce themselves to the
family. Whatever else we can
reestablish their business,
whatever they're doing practice
basketball, So when the game
comes over
Can do a little better than we
did last night. Whatever you
can, but that little break and
then to return, uh, to finish up
the work. I think something
thing to consider is not in
either of these bills. I just
threw it out because I think
some states do that.
Senator Thomann. Yeah. Thank
you, Madam Chair. I forgot to
mention the Colorado limits each
legislator to five bills, except
with the exception of of
Appropriation bills, which so
they had 100.
I think that they have roughly
100 legislators, so that's 500.
500 bills and we've had some
times 1000. But Cowes certainly
hasn't affected the Colorado
economy, their booming so
whether they were eliminated.
Five bills are doing fine.
And also Massachusetts has
Of course, it's a small state
geographically, but they meet
for five months, three days
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
for five months. So like
But that would be that way. I
wouldn't work in
In Mexico because we're much
larger state geographically.
Just thought I'd throw that out.
Thank you. Thank you, madam.
Share interesting. Other members
of the committee.
Oh, I'll say
Yeah, I I don't like how we do
it. Now it's 30 days. It's not
nearly enough time. Um
But as someone who also works
full time Ah
I think it would
My law firm is right now willing
to let me go for 60 days every
other year.
Ah, if I was gone 60 days every
year. I don't know that I would
have have that job. I think it's
asking a lot of an employer.
Two.
Not have someone there for 22
months every year. Um
And it is hard on our families.
Uh, I'm lucky that I live close
enough that I can see my kid,
usually on weekends throughout
the session, but
But I'll tell you this. The long
sessions are a lot harder
actions. Um so I don't know.
I don't know necessarily What
The solution is. I know that, uh
Representative Figueroa, I think
has a bill that does us 4560.
Um
I would probably
I kind of like that splitting of
the difference, too. But
But but the way we're doing it
now sure isn't it's not a great
way to run a state.
You know, great way to do
thoughtful policy making. Um so
I really appreciate both of you
bringing these today. Um
We're at the end of the session.
I
I don't think any of us think
that these are necessarily gonna
be on the ballot at the next
election, but I think it's a
really important discussion for
us to be to have as a body. Um,
and it's something that we need
to
To keep working on, Uh,
procedure and a path that
That allows for the kind of
thoughtful
Policy making and debate that I
know we all want to have some
senators phonics. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Do we have a house?
Joint resolution coming
So, Senator, I think we probably
do now. This it hasn't crushed
over Madam chair. It has not
because I was just wondering in
terms of timing.
You know if we want to see
something done
You know, it's like what has the
better chance of passing because
Thank you. And and Senator. Just
so you know, my assuming that
House resolution crossed over to
us before the virus across over
to them. My intention was if it
was sent to rules was to release
it from rules because we're
having this discussion here
today, so I wouldn't want to
hold anything up. Have the same
discussion that
That were already having Madam
chair if I may. My
understanding speaking to you
with representative Figueroa,
it's on the House floor.
Her measure.
Um
Those 45.
It was amended.
Her measure, so it's 60 days and
then the other would be 45.
Senator combines your that does
that measure have the
restrictions on the 45 that
It's only budgetary or has that
been removed?
Right?
Senator Pirtle. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you, Senators. If I
had a preference, it would be
the 45.
They option personally.
Um, it's already hard enough to
come up 60 days one year and
then
Because of the Germany this
issue. I mean, I think all of us
are experiencing it this year at
a higher level than than we've
ever seen that it's just, um
We're basically power early, too
much power into the into the
executive branch of government.
Um, but maybe we should split
this baby and just go 52 days.
Senator Tallman.
And and so, senators. Let me ask
you this and I should have asked
you this before, So I apologize
for kind of springing it on you.
But
Because both both of your bills
would go to judiciary after
this. Um and since there is a
house bill already on the house
floor, I think has more likely
to make its way over here. Then
neither of these would be to
cross over to the house. Uh, at
this stage.
Are. Are you okay? With us just
rolling these two. They're not
necessarily going to vote on
these today with the
anticipation that we're hoping
that that the house one will
come over or would you like we
can take a vote on these today?
I'm just
Trying to think kind of
practically
Ah!
Um, Madam Chair. Of course, it's
the will of the committee. But,
um
As was mentioned when you're the
debate time it's taken on the
house, and I think
You know, there's already a
movement. Um, we just need to
change the 30 Day.
Session.
So And if I am just if I may
just one more thing, you're
still maintains the 60 days, so
we're not getting rid of the 60
day. Um
It's a slight uptick from the 30
that we haven't does get rid of
the German issues, so I'm
I'm fine for whatever the
committee wishes just to leave
it. Sit. That's fine with me.
Monitor. I was going to make a
motion, but you know, I'll leave
it up to you to let us know what
you want. I was going to move
the do pass on Senate Joint
Resolution four.
And and, you know, etcetera.
And if you don't want to do
that, I'll remove my motion.
Going to the motion or rolling
it. Yes, then make your motion.
I'm moving to pass on Senate
joint resolution for
Alright. Um And is there? Is
there any objection to that
motion? I'm gonna do do pass on
the other one also, so let's go
ahead and do it before I go
ahead and do it on for, um, This

Thank you. Let's go to
r seven with the consensus was
that we got to get rid of
Jermaine
SGR seven.
Good morning, Madam Chairwoman
and so uses it calls for the
creation of an independent
redistricting Commission, which
I'll refer onto as the IRC to
replace the Citizens
Redistricting Committee, which
was created for the 2021
redistricting cycle. Now with
this would do Madam chairwoman
is the IRC would become
responsible for creating
Binding legislative,
Congressional and Public
Education Commission maps
beginning in 2030 bipartisan
majority of 77% of likely voters
in New Mexico support the
establishment of an IRC.
The nine members would be
selected from a statistically
weighted pool of qualified
qualified public applicants.
Three Republicans, three
Democrats and three independent
third party members. The
secretary of state's office with
the listed and review
Applications, hire an
independent expert contractor to
manage the random selection
under carefully designed rules.
And host materials related to
the commission's work until they
hire their own staff. Once the
commission is up and running, it
would become independent of the
secretary of state. Joining me
this morning is representative
Figura who will also make a few
comments, and we also have two
expert witnesses who may also
want to weigh in and we're going
to start off with
Extra witnesses. We have Leonard
Corman, whose via Zoom and
Heather Bella's Who's the
Election Reforms Network, who's
in person with us today.
And Madam chair. Um
Leonard Gorman is the executive
director of the Navajo Nation
Human Rights Commission.
And the Navajo Nation Council
designated the Navajo Navajo
Human Rights Commission to
oversee all redistricting
activities. So that is why he is
here with US and
Vice president.
Election Reformers network
Heather will speak first.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Uh, Madam Chair members of the
Committee. Thank you so much for
making time to hear this bill
this morning as a member of the
fair districts. New Mexico
Coalition. I just want to let
you know that this particular
piece of legislation is notably
improved over some that have
been introduced in the
Legislature in recent years, and
we're going to point out to you
today a number of ways that
we're excited about this
proposal.
Importantly, you should know
that it builds on feedback that
has been received by lawmakers
as well as voters. Um and that
it is, um not a cookie cutter
copy of any other state model
that we've seen around the
country. Instead, it very
intentionally attempts to
address the unique aspects of
New Mexico's geographic
diversity as well as our ethnic
diversity, Unique
characteristics that mean we
need to use a redistricting
process that's right for us.
And so our coalition believes
that this one this draft does in
fact, address those matters.
Look forward to taking your
questions.
Thank you and Madam chairwoman
will next head over to Leonard
Gorman. Because zoom
Mr Corbyn, go ahead.
Thank you, madam chair and
members of the committee. Yeah,
cannot stand in slow this genie,
but just seen
My nomination, Human Rights
Commission.
As introduced by representative
Figueroa has been designated to
represent the Navajo Nation.
Navajo voters in the
redistricting activities and
we've been designated at least
twice at the moment, the 2020
2011 and 2021 redistricting
activities.
We get involved in the Arizona,
New Mexico and Utah
redistricting and we were very
supportive of the Senate Bill
304 that passing 2021 that
established the Citizen
Redistricting Committee at that
time, and we feel that this is
the right step of being
undertaken by this New Mexico
Legislature.
And that as a broad issue for
voting rights, the Navajo Nation
Human Rights Commission passed
the resolution and then the
Nabatiye committee of the
nomination council also passed a
resolution supporting bills that
they believe in Hance, the
voting rights of the Navajo
Nation. Thank you.
Thank you.
And Senator, we do have 12345.
Six. No. Seven people signed up
to speak in support. Um so I'm
gonna ask that, Uh, everyone
keeps their comments to two
minutes or less, will start with
Mason Graham.
And come up and use the mic and
and say you are, please. These
mics are even the handheld ones
If you're not right in front of
your mouth, focus online can't
hear you hear me? There you go.
Thank you, madam Chair members
of the committee.
Name is Mason Graham. I'm the
policy director for a common
cause in Mexico.
Common causes and strong support
of an independent redistricting
commission in order to ensure
that our voters in our
communities are accurately and
properly represented in 2020. We
did do a poll on this issue and
we did find that the majority of
new Mexicans across geographic
and ethnic backgrounds,
political parties did support
the creation of an independent
redistricting commission.
We also do have a online
petition that we've been running
for the last few years. That
petition is now at over 750
signatures, also calling for an
independent redistricting
commission. We really appreciate
the process that was created by
the Citizens Redistrict
Commission and we believe that
it's time to go one step further
and have a truly independent
process. Thank you, an expert to
pass
Good morning, Madam Chair
members of the committee. I'm
Hannah Birling, president of the
League of Women Voters of New
Mexico.
We support a redistricting
process and standards that allow
new Mexicans and meaningful
choice in selecting their
representatives.
And that also increase public
trust in our election process
and our government.
I think that's it
Great. Thank you so much, And we
ask that you give this
resolution to do pass.
Thank you, Lauren Burn Ali.
Madam chair.
Madam Chair, Um, committee
members. My name is Lauren.
Burn, Ellie. I come from an area
in the northwest corner of New
Mexico. Shiprock, New Mexico.
I've worked with the Navajo
Nation Human Rights Commission
for 15 years now and through
that tenure, I have been very
active and involved in the
redistricting activities in the
states of Utah, Arizona and New
Mexico. I strongly support this
legislation. I think that it
provides an opportunity for
citizens of New Mexico to weigh
in on a very important process.
I also would like to thank the
senators here and urge you to
support this referendum. Thank
you.
Thank you, Kathleen Burke.
Good morning, madam Chair,
Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you.
Kathleen Burke Fair districts
for New Mexico, an organization
organization of over 40, New
Mexico, and national
organizations and more than
50,000, New Mexico voters.
We have provided you with
handouts. If you will kindly see
those
According to a 2022 New Mexico
poll of 500 likely voters 77%
want an independent
Redistricting commission and
only 12% oppose
More than any past redistricting
method. The drafters of this
resolution have created a
proposal for an independent
redistricting commission of the
highest possible standard for
the New Mexico Legislature and
for New Mexico voters and to
ensure that your constituents
communities of interest will be
kept intact.
Hmm. In the hope that we may put
this on the ballot and let the
people decide.
Madam Chair, Ladies and
gentlemen.
Fair districts proudly offers
you this resolution. We ask for
your vote in support today.
Thank you.
Thank you, Cedric Page.
Good morning. Uh,
Good morning, madam Chair.
Members of the committee Cedric
Page.
Alright, There we go. Thank you.
I'm uh, the past coach chair of
the New Mexico First
redistricting Task Force in 2022
and following on the work of
Justice. Chavez led that
organization earlier. I'm also a
member of the N A. A. C P of
Santa Fe.
Local action committee.
We stand. I stand strongly in
support of this, Uh, resolution,
as a community member as a
person involved in a number of
community activities. I see this
as a way to get more people
involved in understanding their
community of interest.
As a professional geographer
with over I won't say 50 years
of experience teaching and
practicing geography, getting
people to understand how to map
their community. How to map
their community of interest is
critically important. I think
this is a process that will come
about through the establishment
of a independent redistricting
commission.
So with that I stand in support
of this resolution. Thank you
for your time. Thank you on
zoom. We have Robert Rattigan.
Robert, Go ahead and proceed for
two minutes.
Good morning, madam Chair.
members of the committee Robert
Rhatigan and independent voter
and member of the Mexico 2020
Citizens Redistricting
Committee. The CRC was a great
step forward towards fair
elections and fair
representation in New Mexico.
The next step is this resolution
in the establishment of an
independent redistricting
commission that creates binding
maps.
Valid criticism of the Citizens
Redistricting Committee was that
it did not reflect the
geographic and demographic
diversity of our state members
were disproportionately white
and from the Albuquerque area.
The statistical weighting method
in this resolution allows for an
impartial process of selecting
commissioners. It gives fair
opportunity to new Mexicans in
every corner of our state from
every race, ethnicity, sex, age
and political affiliation. Thank
you, madam Chair.
Thank you. And last we have
Sharon Berman, who is also on
zoom.
Good morning. Thank you, Madam
Chair and committee members for
all you do, and for considering
this resolution, I'm Sharon
Berman and I am a policy manager
for New Mexico. First, a
statewide cross partisan,
nonprofit organization, bringing
people together to learn about
and suggest actionable solutions
for a better new Mexico.
Organization convened over a
period of three years. The New
Mexico redistricting Task force,
which considered ways to
strengthen our state
redistricting act.
Well. Several of their
recommendations help strengthen
the 2021 act, their top priority
and independent redistricting
commission was not included.
The task force consisted of over
25 members. It was diverse,
culturally professionally in
geographically, they were
students, Business people,
researchers, legislators,
members of state and tribal
governments, non profit
organizations and members of
state and national associations.
Please pass SJ R seven, allowing
for an independent redistricting
commission and help our state
lead the nation to a stronger,
fairer and visionary
redistricting system. Thank you,
madam chair and committee
members.
Thank you, but anyone in the
audience like to raise their
hand to indicate support
Then we don't have anyone signed
up in opposition.
Madam chairman, I wrap up Do we
have time?
Sure. Give me just a 2nd 60 60
seconds. We'll give me just a
second. Sure representative.
Would anyone like to raise their
hand to indicate opposition?
Okay, so you now go ahead. Wrap
up. Thank you, Madam Chair. I'll
answer a couple of questions
that come up a lot before we
even start and the first one is.
Why do this now?
And the answer is because 2030
is coming faster than we expect,
And we need time as you just
spent.
A great wild debating. We need
time for thoroughly vetted
legislation to set up the new
system.
We also have the institutional
knowledge with us.
Of what worked and what didn't
in our last process. We don't
want to lose that.
Committee CRC members, Um
Justice, Chavez and Rattigan
have contributed to their
process and we've all seen and
still remember what worked well.
and what didn't want to take
that knowledge and apply it to
setting up the process for the
next time.
And what worked well.
The middle.
The public testimony. The public
input to map making the debating
process through the middle, but
there were concerns as was just
mentioned about the selection
process at the end.
And about the binding nature of
maps at the end.
The Citizens Redistricting
Committee was created with the
intent that the maps would be
binding, but that required a
constitutional amendment and we
did not have time.
So we made that huge step
forward for New Mexico. This is
the next piece. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you. Committee.
Thank you. All right. Members of
the committee Senator Tuesday
Peanuts.
Thank you, Madam Chairman and
and thank you, senator and and
future senator for bringing this
forward Representative, Um
I guess.
I just want to start by saying
that your definition of what
went wrong does not at all job
with my experience of that. I
thought the experience was
great.
I thought to keep in mind that
there is an infinite number of
possible maps.
All of which would have the
right would meet all the
criteria.
We didn't give you one of the
options that we had.
Which was making sure
That you knew where the you know
where that you could take into
account You knew where, but you
couldn't take into account where
incumbents
Lived, you know, with their
homes were and so the maps you
presented us with did create a
number of real political issues
for us pairing members of the
same party in the same district
and a number of locations that
could have been avoided.
The maps would have been just as
good just as representative in
every way.
But wouldn't have created those
problems.
We had that additional criteria
and we were able to adjust.
And we were required to accept
the maps that you said to us, so
to say that because we didn't
accept them, That's the problem.
I reject that.
We came up with maps that were
so good that they were not
challenged.
For the I'm talking about the
legislative districts. They were
not challenging first time in
30 years that those maps were
challenged in court 40 years.
Because you all had great
Input from the public and you
gave us a number of options.
And and I so I think we followed
the process and it worked really
well.
We were able to, you know to to
avoid having some some, you know
political catastrophes, but by
not matching people up in the
same districts which your maps
would have required. But we
hadn't asked you not to do that.
My thought is, Let's just give
you use the same process but
give you the opportunity to take
into account where where
incumbents live.
And if you still want to go
ahead and put to you know if
your process would still put two
incumbents in the same district,
we we We kind of got backed into
that at the at the end, but But
I really do think that that that
the process worked well.
I see no need to change it.
Thank you, madam German
Thank you some remorse. Thank
you, madam. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you, Senator. And
thank you. Almost former
representative, Um
Soon to be former
representative. Um and now you
got it. Um, I've obviously been
a strong advocate for
redistricting since my first day
here and, um
Uh huh. And Senator Neal and I
used to be on this committee and
I were very strong supporters of
this and originally on this task
force, and but it seems like a
lot of the input we gave was
ignored. I think we shared the
concern that if you try to come
up here and completely removed
the legislature politically,
you're not going to get that
done. I've always not liked
legislators picking our own
districts. For all the reasons
um
That I don't need to go into.
Um, but I don't mind us, drawing
the districts for the
congressional members or the
Department of Education. I do
think it's incestuous and
backroom deals when we draw our
own districts, and that's why
you get the districts that they
look like they do. But I do like
the fact that congressional
members have to talk to us every
10 years and have to come to us
and and But I think that part of
redistricting that don't sit
well with me. It's just drawing
our own districts.
Um And so cutting the
Legislature out is something
central to kneel, and I
recommend that you guys don't do
completely and you're still has
to be a role and that was
ignored. And in also, this
constitutional member isn't wage
was written. I told the
advocates three weeks ago that I
couldn't support this because it
was so cumbersome and so poorly
written.
That we needed a committee sub
That's very simple. One
paragraph, There shall be an
independent redish in commission
is established by law. Um and
that doesn't seem that we ever
got that. I asked for that to
be, um, drafted and presented
and doesn't seem to have
happened.
So I will as a citizen support
independent redistricting. Um
I'm sad that it was my last vote
here. I can't move this forward
because it doesn't seem like a
lot of the input the real life
Political input that was given
to the task force was included,
and that's a shame. Um and I'm I
won't speak for Senator O'Neill.
But I will. Um, we've had these
conversations, the two of us
that
That to get this through the
Legislature and get the
Legislature to pat give up its
power to do redistricting.
You're still gonna have to
include them somehow in future
legislatures and just taken away
from them completely and not
having a role for them just
isn't gonna politically happened
on either side of the aisle. Um
and so I hope in the future
before the 3rd 2030 we can ever
Redistrict Commission
And I was the sponsor of the
Republican House Senate sponsor
of the Redistricting commission,
as it was last time, and we got
that done at the last six.
Seriously, the 11th hour if you
all remember you were there for
almost four. That was
interesting that was sausage
making at its best, and but I do
think it moved the ball down the
field, and I hope that we we, as
a state can get to this, uh, for
legislative. Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Representative. Thank
you.
Thank you, Senator Nibert.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um
Senator representative.
I was never a fan of
Redistricting to begin with
Reed.
They commission that we went
through.
I participated in the process as
it came to my community. Aw, uh,
you know, the
Maybe it's a participation that
occurred in my community.
I didn't go around the state to
participate in the other ones.
But
You know?
My assessment is that the public
participation was
Was
Fairly then, uh, there were
certainly some advocacy groups
that were organized and did
attend.
But the average citizen, uh
You know?
Was
Basically relying upon the
system.
And our community. Uh, my
community.
So what happened? Uh, where the
only county in the state that's
has a part of all three
congressional districts.
My part of the state. Uh
Each house district and I don't
know the Senate numbers, but I
know this house numbers pretty
well.
Uh, each House seat.
Yeah, and, uh,
Eastern New Mexico's about
31,005 the average uh, most of
the Northwest.
House seats or 27,500.
That's quite a disparity. That's
what we got.
Uh,
And so you know, I'm somewhat
disenchanted. I think, uh,
My community was fairly
disenchanted with the
Results We talked about
protecting. I can show you a
congressional map in the city of
Roswell.
That helped innately splits up
communities of interest City
Braswell's in two congressional
districts, the town of
50,000 is in two congressional
districts.
County of 139,000 is in three
congressional districts.
So it's a bit odd. Uh,
Hmm. And with respect to, uh
Education Board of Education.
Uh, we got it corrected.
But what came out was
District nine
The
Incumbent
Of district 10 was now in
District nine and the incumbent
and district
Mine was in district 10. They
swapped them.
We got it corrected, but only
after we raised a fuss and got
permission from
The one of the entities that
spoke earlier.
And it wouldn't have passed if
they hadn't said that they
approve that change. And that
was the only change that was
allowed on the House side.
The only
We tried to address some other
issues and
They could not.
You know first, So, um, you
know, I I know the Senate side
addressed a lot of issues that
were pointed there or TCP? No
But on the House side, The only
change that occurred was with
respect to the board of
Education, and that was
Getting the two districts on the
East side swap back position.
Um
So I'm somewhat disenchanted
with the whole process myself. I
do think that that we as
legislators
We are accountable and
We have to go back and face
The people that elect us
If you have an independent
redistricting commission, these
people are appointed.
And they're not really
accountable.
To the people.
They are appointed to fill a
position for time. And so, uh,
if you take the legislature
completely out of the process,
the people have really no
recourse other than to write.
What the what The concerns are.
Um and so
I agree with my colleague.
Um, senator more is that the
Legislature does have a role to
play want to create a body that
that does some of the heavy
lifting.
You know, we might but I do
think that that we as a
legislative body to ultimately
make those decisions and and my
biggest beef was
What came packaged to
Legislature.
Uh, certainly.
And I talked to many of my
colleagues on the Democrat side
of the aisle from Virgilio and
asked him, You know, how did how
did this happen? Uh, you know
how how come they represent
31,500 people when Republican
and Democrat legislators in
northwest New Mexico represent,
uh
Largely
You know, no explanation for
that. So
I still prefer for us to have a
role in it. Uh,
This basically from from Page
two line.
17 to the end is all new
material. It's not designated as
new material, but it certainly
is new material, and it's a
substantial substantial link.
It's uh
If it would add.
A number of pages to our
constitution.
Um and
I'm I'm concerned about.
About putting all of that stuff
in the statute. I think I think
we can
Probably
Do something with our laws with
respect to redistricting and not
have to shin but
This effort is to totally
Wipe out the legislative body,
the only say would be
There's several appointments
that certain members of the
Legislature would make. Not all
the members of the Legislature.
So with that I'm opposed to
this.
Senators phonics.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
while I would like to support
independent, um
Commission. I think this is
written like a statute.
It. I agree with Senator Morris
needs to be, you know, 1 to 1.5
pages to be And if you could,
uh,
Hair it down.
You would have my vote, but
This appropriate
In my opinion.
Thank you if you want to. Thank
you, Madam chair. Thank you,
Senator. That was the committee
sub
For the purposes of
transparency we wanted
This legislation to be posted
this proposal to be posted so
that the shorter committee said,
which we didn't get to you in
time, Madam Chair and and
Senator. I'm sorry. Um, but we
wanted it to be transparent.
where that committee sub was
supposed to lead, so we wanted
this longer version out there.
Excuse me, man Chairs,
representative and Senator. So
senator about an hour before
committee this morning.
We got a committee sub. None of
the analysts had it wasn't had
10 been provided any analysts
hadn't been provided to members
are rules safer Committee subs.
You need to get them to us, at
least 24 hours ahead of time.
Um, I would move to pass this
over until we get to it.
Madam chair. I do have an
amendment that I think would
Take this palatable.
Well, um
Well, I mean, so if if that's
the motion, so you're making a
motion to to roll it over,
Senator, I did.
It can be voted down. But I I if
there is a committee subway
should be reviewing it is there
They're up discussion on that
motion discussion. Yes, Madam
Chairman. Are we meeting
tomorrow or Sunday?
So senators were meeting on
Sunday but only for
confirmations. So if Monday
would be the earliest
I mean, if they have a committee
sub I don't see any point in
discussing the
The bill that has been subbed
out.
Just because we didn't get it 24
hours. I mean, I would I would
agree with the motion.
Alright, let's uh on the motion
the motion I've been asking for
committees.
Madam chair. I'm going to just
apologize. It was
Put out in past February, 2nd in
house government.
And entirely my mistake that it
didn't get to you on that date.
We weren't scheduled in here
yet, and it was miscommunication
on my part, but it's posted and
you all are. Welcome to look at
it. Thank you, Madam Chair,
Madam chair.
Yeah.
It's a senator's responsibility
If this is a Senate joint
resolution, the senator is the
one who needed to bring it to
us. So we're not dealing with
the House joint resolution. We
are dealing with the Senate,
Joe. Thank you very much, madam
Chair. The resolution was sent
to me at 6:30. P.m. day before
yesterday. I've been going
through so much thinking about
my brother's death that it was
last in a million gun bill.
Emails that are coming in when
we then worked with the analyst
yesterday, he had questions for
us. And finally when we got him
to understand what we were
doing, it was 630 PM again the
next day, so it's not that we
ignored it and I dropped the
ball intentionally.
We tried.
Thank you, madam Chair.
All right. We are on a motion to
to roll this over. Is there any
objection to that motion? No.
Your motion.
That might be your motion. It's
not my motion and a second
All right. Is there any
objection to that motion,
Okay, so your bills
Well, we'll get it before the
beat. We hear this again. Yes,
and we'll get it out to all the
analysts, Um
Real quick before before you all
Leave, Um
I just to the extent that you
are going to continue to try to
take this lottery approach.
Let me attempt to dissuade you
from doing so.
Um, So this is, I think, uh,
modeled largely on what Michigan
did.
Right now They're redrawing 13
legislative districts in
Michigan because it turns out
when you just get like a random
lottery of people to do a highly
technical process like
redistricting.
They don't know how to do it,
and then so and they then are
completely dependent on experts
that are provided to them. And
in Michigan, those experts told
them to do racial gerrymanders.
So, which is why those 13
districts are now having to be
redrawn because they were
All racial gerrymanders and the
folks who are on the commission
didn't have the background
didn't have the knowledge to be
able to critically assess assess
the information that they are
being given from those experts.
Because they were just these
randomly selected, folks. Um
Also the when you you have this
set up to
For the demographics of New
Mexico to be reflected, but not
the political affiliations to be
reflected when you put the same
equal amounts of folks on the
commission for political
affiliations that does not
reflect
The political makeup of New
Mexico So you are over
empowering.
Uh, the minority when you do
that, Um I would very much urged
folks with when I am not against
independent redistricting. Uh,
but
I would
I would. I think there's I don't
think this isn't a workable
approach. Um and I think that
for approaches in the future
Um
There should be a deep dive
into, especially if they're
being modeled after what other
states have done.
There needs to be a deep dive
first into how it's worked out
in those states because I think
Michigan is a really good
example of it not working, so I
was very surprised to see a
Michigan approach.
Being proposed here, Um
That's all. Thank you. Thank you
all very much, Madam shirt. Can
I just
If they're coming back with the
committee sub make of suggestion
of possibility? Sure, I mean,
assuming that if if it's going
to track with the house
Resolution that somehow that'll
survive mustard of this
illustrious committee. I think
it's a little presumptive, but
Um, they'd be on page two lines
1415 and 16 strike the strike
through
And then
Online 21 strike and adopt
Online 22.
Strike congressional districts,
comma
Strike and the and then line 23
straight through to the period
It would read by September 1st
of the year. The federal
decennial Census census.
Redistrict Commission shall be
established to develop plans for
the redistricting of state
legislative districts and then
strike everything after that,
until
No, and I hope that they all
they're listening to your
suggestion in sheriff since you
Jason gave us that new
information. I like the bill
now. Ah.
Great. Thank you all so much,
and we're gonna go ahead and
move on to tax.
Um
Uh, we're gonna do set up
Memorial five and then Senator
Portal. We'll end with yours.
All right, Senator Lopez, go
ahead.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm
sitting in front of committee
with Senate Memorial five.
And what this is proposing is to
request the LFC to create a task
force to support enhanced the
restructuring of the Children,
Youth and Families Department.
Um, Madam Chair members of the
committee as you There's some
membership. That's um
Being suggested.
The task force is supposed to
immediately East monthly and, um
There's a
I guess when it comes down to
you, madam chair is, um let me
just one more thing to mention,
too, is that I did have a chance
to also speak with Mr Sully.
I'm from the Legislative Finance
Committee. And he also, um gave
some directions to some of the
parameters that this task force
would look at and reviewing.
Um all of the data that we have
available Madam chair members of
the committee. There's plenty of
information that we have.
Um, there are other states who
have gone through some
restructuring of their own
Children, Families departments,
Um State of Oklahoma has
recently gone through a complete
restructure.
Um A lot of this work has been
done, of course and support with
the anti E K C.
Foundation and some of their
subsidiaries in
Um Madam Chair was in a, um, at
a conference in Houston talking
about juvenile justice reform,
and I had a chance to learn a
little bit more about the work
of Annie E. Casey across our
country. Their focus, of course,
is working with
Families what I call families in
crisis.
They've done a lot of good work
here in the state of New Mexico,
and I know that, um
I think there'll be an added
value. If this memorial passes
for them to go, also come and
work with us as we look as to a
proposal
For this next coming legislative
session about how we possibly
restructure C Y F D and I'll
stand for questions.
Thank you. Um, we didn't have
anyone signed up and support.
Thank you. We did have one
person signed up in opposition,
Marilyn Beck.
Can come up.
Thank you, madam Chairwoman and
committee members.
I would just caution against
this. This is a task force to
review task forces, and we have
spent the past six years
reviewing task forces.
Um, I stand before you today.
Just really, um, frustrated the
executive order that was passed
was passed 51 weeks ago and
almost literally nothing has
been done and the Office of
Children Rights has ceased to
exist in that time, and three
out of the seven committee
members of the Policy Council
have resigned.
Um, there are not sides in child
welfare. But there are I mean,
That's not true. There are sides
that think that this is an
urgent crisis that needs to be
dealt with, and another task
force is not going to be the
solution. I do want to say that
I come before you today,
thinking and begging. Um
We elect you the public members
to do hard jobs.
And I think just coming, you're
going to leave the session in
six days and say
Don't worry. We fixed child
welfare. We did another task
force.
We did another task force and I
want to say that this is
studying the task force.
The chair. I thank you for
bringing forward but she sat on
the task force with me for the
enhancing Steering committee and
the house starting Real 10 Task
Force. We have enough. I want to
say that solutions can and will
exist with six days. You have
the opportunity that house Bill
175 and then chairwoman Senator
do Higgs bill would actually
make a difference in the
confidentiality if you're
looking at things to study.
A recent I'm in New Mexico
Foundation of Open Government
Award winner for 2023 William S.
Dixon F d a lot.
This is the executive. These are
the exit interviews from 2023.
Let me just show you you can't
even see And I have the general
counsel here. I'm shaking as I
tell you this, but there are
real solutions. Yes, your face.
I have exit interviews. If you
want to find out why C y f D is
not working, amend the
confidentiality clause do real
change because another task
force when you go back to your
constituents and say we fixed C
Y f d. We passed another task
force. I'm going to tell you
that's just not true.
Thank you.
Would anyone like to raise their
hands into Cheops? Alright
members of the committee? Sure.
Hold on.
Madam chairman, and, uh,
Senator. What? Maryland
We had seen those exit
interviews. These are exit
interviews with workers leaving
the department and the question
was, Do you have any suggestions
for how the department can be
improved?
Everything was redacted. We
don't know what the workers now
This is not an open, transparent
organization. This is an
organization that's covering its
own ask. And and this is just
You know, it's it's It's really
peculiar.
That they would have had the
gall to send that out and in
response to an emperor request
when it says nothing you wanted
to know what we're doing Nothing
That's a pretty good example of
what's going now. Uh, but what
can we do?
I had an amendment. It was
tabled in judiciary not tabled.
Really. It was just rolled over.
But that's not gonna happen this
year.
I think we need to amend the the
the
Confidentiality provisions in
the Children's code. Absolutely.
They should protect kids, but
they shouldn't protect
malfeasance or
Unseasoned by the department.
Um
I am going to vote for this
because we've got to do
something, but it is.
An inadequate response to a
crisis. I think Marilyn's right
on this regard. Thank you, Madam
Prison. Madam Chairman. Thank
you. Thank you. Thank you for
the
Promotion. Yes, I have Senator
Baca first and Senator Morse.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um
I? Yeah, reading this. You know,
I I agree with with Miss Beck
and and what she just stated. It
is disgraceful to see that
confidentiality literally. It's
a cover up. It's a legal and
statutory rules, uh, or by rule
made to cover up the
inadequacies of C Y F. D.
Um, that organization is as as a
senator or TZ, Pino said in
crisis after lengthy questioning
the secretary designee at that
time, uh, admitted that it was a
crisis. We have got to do
something. I'm going to support
this. I am going to support it
just because we've done nothing
this year.
Nothing.
I I just can't imagine that we
sat here for 30 days we have we
are we have that that cap in
place that we have done nothing
on since July.
And we're sitting here and and
we're doing this small thing. I
just I just don't know. Madam
Chair and Senator
Why this body doesn't have the
will to do more. We can do
whatever we want.
And we should make this better
This building needs to be torn
down C y f D
And it needs to be rebuilt into
something that is transparent
and workable and protect. So I'm
I'm gonna I'm gonna vote for
your memorial here.
I don't know how effective it's
going to be, but I'll tell you
what, I'm certainly not going to
go back to my district and say
We fixed it just the opposite.
I'm going to say we did nothing
because that's what we did. We
did nothing. We had no messages
coming down on this. We had a
secretary in here that says that
she's going to assess it. For
God knows how long I don't know
how long we need to assess it.
If you can look back and see
what's going on there.
Um, you know, they need to start
cleaning house in that agency.
They need to start doing some
rulemaking. They need a they
need to come in and do do
sweeping changes. Not not these
little Mickey Mouse solutions
that are really not empowering
anybody within the agency or
protecting our kids. So, um
Anyway, We've had lengthy
discussion on this this, uh,
session. I'm hoping that
Hoping and praying that all of
us can come together on this
important issue and and really
do something.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Morse. Thank
you, ma'am. Sure. Thank you,
Senator. And thank you,
Maryland. It's your passion and
your, um and I appreciate,
although not here anymore Angle
You always say it's kissing your
sister and show your passion and
you're trying to do something.
Comments in the paper this
morning were very, very strong
to do so Hopefully they will get
the message upstairs and across
the street someday that this is
unacceptable.
Thank you, Senator Pirtle.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. I'm going to
support the memorial. And I
think
It is doing. I'd like to see C Y
f d Just take the advice of my
grandfather. He said. When you
when you find yourself in a hole
Stop digging.
Some point. Somebody needs to
take the shovel from these
people.
Um, and that's us.
And and, unfortunately the
Legislature throughout the years
is giving away its authority. Of
course, I've always tried to be
a strong opponent to that. I
know you've opposed many times
when we've tried to give away
our authority. Um Senator Morris
and Senator Boxer as well in
this committee. Um, and that's
what we have to look at is. How
do we get that power back that
oversight back because how many
times
Do we sit in here and go? Well,
we how many memorials do we pass
just requesting information.
Um and and I think I've said it
plenty of times where the
executive branch doesn't respect
the Legislature. This is another
example of that that we would
even have to pass something like
this to get the answers that we
need.
Um, there's this idea that if
they just ignore this, it's
going to go away.
It's not going to go away
because we have people like Mrs
Beck.
In the audience. That's not
gonna they're not gonna let it
go away.
And that's the only thing that
gives me hope on this issue is
that people are this passionate
in this fired up about our
Children.
In the way they're being treated
the way they're being neglected,
Not just by, you know their
parents or their guardians. But
when the state's supposed to be
stepping in and ensuring that
they are not harmed.
And so I think that's the
biggest disappointment to me is
that somehow? Um, we're ignoring
those that know.
What? What can be fit, how to
fix it.
Um
And it's
To admit
There's a crisis.
So it wasn't a complete loss. At
least now we have an admittance
of of a crisis. That's step one
If anybody is aware of this of
the 12 steps, that's step one.
Um and so hopefully we can move
from there. It's unfortunate we
have to wait till next session
because we haven't got the
messages. We haven't had the
movement.
Um there's a lack of desire to
really push forward, um, because
there's at least one or two kids
out there for sure that a year
is too long.
One month is too long. One week
is too long.
Um heck, this weekend's gonna be
too long.
So we got to do something.
I don't know what it is. I'm
just a farmer from Chavez
County. But I know there's some
people out there that do and
hopefully this moves us in the
right direction. Thank you,
Senator. Senators, phonics.
Thank you, Manager. Thank you,
Senator for bringing this
forward and I'm going to vote
for it. Um, my question, Madam
Cure. Senator is the lfc on
board with this
Madam Chair. Um, Senator? Yes,
okay.
Uh, Madam Chair, Senator, I
would hope that the appointment
by the governor would have
authority to actually go back
and make changes and not just
sit and talk to the group.
And Madam chair. Um
Senator, I hope that there would
be in all the recommendations
that there would be statutory.
Uh, recommendations one of the
things that I heard from
Of former employees that the
Children's code
Was in dire need of revision,
especially 32 Dash A. So it
would seem to me that we're
talking about the department,
but we're also talking about
other entities that feed into
the department. Thank you, madam
Chair.
Madam chairman, I just add
Go ahead, um, for the comment to
Senator Stephan X made and
Senator TZ Pino has had some I
mean, we've all had interest,
but we do have a task force is
reviewing the Children's code at
this time.
So there may be whatever the
outcome is for the next
legislative session, some
potential revisions.
So I I don't know what else
we're working on yet, but we'll
be reconvening right after
session is
Senator McKenna.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Good
morning colleagues. Thank you,
Senator Lopez.
For your
Your diligence and working on
this memorial.
I'm
Just like, um, a previous piece
of legislation that was
proposing
For a commission on C Y F. D.
I'm opposing this memorial as
well. Madam Chair and senator,
and I want to explain why
I differ.
In the opinion that we haven't
done anything this session for C
Y F. D.
We just days ago.
Confirmed a secretary.
I'm gonna repeat that we just
days ago confirmed the
secretary.
Yes, she was acting for several
months.
But I'm gonna harken back to my
training and organization
development.
One of those tenants are
Is pardon me, Madam Chair and
Senator.
All groups, individuals.
Working on a team.
They all have to have Byeon.
Contribute and agreed to towards
a goal.
And I'm looking at the Madam
chair. I'm looking at the one of
the
The agency bill analysis, and
this came from C Y F. D.
I'm looking at page.
Let's see. They're not numbered,
Madam chair hold on just a
moment. So it's on page 12.
Three under significant issues,
Madam Chair and Senator
The work outlined in this, SM
has already been undertaken or
is currently being conducted.
The work outlined in this, SM
would be duplicative.
Of these previous and current
efforts.
Similar similar
Advisory boards and task groups
have been assembled in the past
and C Y F D continues to
implement many of the consensus
recommendations are very small
groups.
So, Madam Chair and Senator, I
see
Our
Implementing yet another task
force on C Y F D as onerous.
Yes, we find
In January of 25.
There are still
Alarming gaps of performance.
In C Y F. D.
Then this body can say Hey,
This is what we've considered,
Let's go back to them. Let's
have that conversation with our
secretary.
Madam chair and, um, Senator.
Was secretary was the secretary
consulted about this?
Proposed memorial. Um Madam
Chair, Senator. No.
All right. Thank you again, Um
Madam Sharon. Senator, I have a
lot of respect for those who
have war trying to get our arms
around this.
We do care about
All of those Children that were
serving in the families.
But again, let's let our newly
confirmed secretary
Assess completely as a confirmed
secretary Cabinet secretary, um,
let her teams
Assess.
And put forth.
What they need what they've
identified to do give them time
to soar on the on this for
Pardon me, give them the
opportunity.
To serve.
Their clients and the families.
And not let's not add yet
another layer.
Of management to them.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Senator.
Thank you, Senator McKenna,
Senator Nibert.
Oh, thank you, madam Chair and
senator for bringing this, Um
As previously stated, There's
not a lot that we can do in this
session and I wish we could do
more.
And you know, last set or
In January. We tried to do those
measures.
All seemed to go by the wayside
through the process, but
We're limited in what we can do
during this, Uh this session is
was debated earlier. With
respect to some resolutions we
were considering
And so
If we don't pass this memorial,
then
Where are we?
What we're left with. Maybe an
existing study. We're left with.
Maybe some hope that, uh
The secretary who has been
recently confirmed.
Uh, will
Pick up the ball and run with
it.
But this is the only way that we
can have some oversight at this
time.
And it may be, uh,
Maybe an inadequate. Uh
Response. But it's really the
only arrow that we have left in
our quiver, so to speak.
One question I have Madam chair
in senator is
In the list of things that you
want this task force to do.
I don't see anything that talks
about.
Recommendations for changes in
statutes.
And
Is it generally covered or do we
need to add something to request
them to look at some changes,
and I'm particularly interested
in statutory changes that would
break that department up to get
it focused, at least that part
that's dealing with abuse and
neglect. Get them focused on
As I said before the best
interests of the child, and, uh,
Do you think it's that aspects
covered or is it covered with
something else that's going on
or is that something that
We need to add to this task
forces responsibility. Madam
Chair, Senator. I appreciate
your question, because that
actually is the genesis. So what
started this whole thing about?
How do we and it says there to
enhance the restructuring?
Restructuring, of course, covers
quite a bit when you think
about what can be done.
If there's something statutory,
Um it should be presented before
us when you know the reports
given out
Um, it would land lend itself
for the interim committees and
others too.
If there's something statutory
that needs to happen, and we
should be doing that.
Oh, I just I just want to make
sure And if Madam Chairman,
Senator if you're involved in
this process, making sure that
they focus on on that aspect,
because that's really what this
branch of government can do, We
can change statutes, we can
create statutes.
But we can't implement the
statutes. And so what we can do
is find out. What are the
deficiencies in the statutory
charge that we've given the
executive to deal with this
subject matter And what changes
do we need to make to provide
that?
Focus. Provide that authority
provide that, um, desire of of
what this body feels is
necessary to address that crisis
That's been stated and so we
need to enhance that language or
if you're comfortable with with
that existing language. I'm
fine. I just want to make sure
somebody is going to be talking
to these folks on this task
force.
And try to get us some some
direction as to what we need to
do. I know we're going to hear
it from some advocacy, folks.
uh, this next 6060 days session
and what we need to do, and
we'll continue to try to push
legislation through but we have
we really need buy in from
The agency We need buying from
from the executive, frankly, to
to really
Make a dent in
The deficiencies that that
currently exist and the Children
that are being harmed and the,
uh the efforts that we're
currently engaged in as a state.
Are inadequate, and I think
everybody recognizes that. So I
hope that in this process you'll
your, uh
Implore upon them to look at
that specifically. And I I have
heard that the department is
going to undertake a substantial
rewrite of the entire Children's
codes. So that's a pretty heavy
lift. But I I hope that part of
that is to address some of the
Problems that we've seen that
Miss Beck has pointed out on
many, many, many occasions that
we need to get
Our handle on
And so I look forward to maybe
seeing a report.
Giving us some clear guidance.
What? What type of legislation
we need to do. Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Senator, Senator
Stewart.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I just
I didn't. I didn't get the bills
that Marilyn Beck mentioned. If
we pass those two, we would be
doing something about C Y f D if
she could just tell us those
again or if you can, if you
remember one in yours. Yes,
Senator, So one of them is
Senate Bill 258.
And then there's a slightly,
There's a slightly different
house version as well.
And what's the status? Those two
bills? They did not get a
message.
Need to 60 Day session.
Senator PHP or TCP now, Thank
you, Madam Chairman and I'm
grateful to Senator Nyberg for
Bringing up the issue of working
on legislation. We can do that
in the interim Health and Human
Services Committee, and I think
we should make that one of our
real goals this summer.
Especially the whole age. Just
become
A black hole.
Until a tragedy occurs. And then
they say, Oh, well, you know, we
can't tell you about it because
it's confidential and
That would be I think whatever
happened at this test force goes
through. That's fine, too. But
we can. What? Whatever happens
to it. We can start working on
Trying to do some legislative
changes during that the
committee then can endorse it in
care.
Yeah. Senator Baca. Thank you,
Madam Chair. It's interesting to
hear where your bill is. I would
remind this committee and others
that, uh, Germany, this is a
very subjective matters. So
maybe committees committee needs
to meet him, perhaps consider
that bill and where it might fit
in with the current messages we
have. That's an excellent
suggestion.
Yeah, Uh, Senate Bill 258.
Other members of the committee.
Just briefly. I I think I think
everyone else is pretty much
said the same things I was going
to say, um
And and Senator, I know that you
are deeply involved in these
issues. Uh,
And
I'm glad that you are. Are there
at the table when
When these are these issues are
being considered and and that
you're on that task force. Uh,
that you mentioned that's
looking at the Children's code.
Um
I feel some of the same thing
will repeat some of the
sentiments that
It's a
It feels like a we have an
inadequate tools at our disposal
to to deal with this right now,
and I don't know that another
task forces is the answer. Um
But I seems to be kind of the
only option before us, Uh, at
the moment, so
So, uh, kind of take the same
approach than I did on
Or or cheesy, Pinos. Uh
Proposition of
I don't know that this is the
solution we need. Um, but I'm
gonna vote for it because we
just don't have very many
solutions in front of us. I do
think that overall and see why
FD it's It's not that we don't
know what the solutions are.
We know what the solutions are.
It's just a matter of being
able. And I
I, uh
And very much looking forward to
seeing. What our how our new
secretary meets those
challenging so
So with that, uh,
Or cheesy peanut or center
spikes. We're going to make a
motion.
All right. We have a motion for
it to pass. I was still rock
Hopper.
Senator Baca.

Members of the Committee. Thank
you. All right, Senator Pirtle.
Let's have some fun.
Ah!
Senator Purtle. I will tell you
I've had no less than probably
12. People come up to me and say
Why is this on the agenda and I
told them I thought it would be
a lot of fun to have this
discussion. Yes,
yeah.
Right?
Thank you, Madam Chair today we
have before you Senate joint
resolution 14.
And I'm just going to start
with, um Arbil locator that we
have for the Legislature. Senate
Bill One Water Trust fund.
Senate bill to Low Income Solar
Act. Senate Bill three Paid
Family Medical Leave Act Senate
Bill five.
Firearms near polling places.
Bill six. Cannabis Regulation
CHANGES Senate Bill 77 ru ru
filibustering your own Bill,
What's happening right now,
madam? Sure. I just thought it
would be important to just list
all of the bills that negatively
impact on proportionately rural
counties. And and so I think we
we get the just go ahead. Let's
let's go to your your bill.
Thank you, madam Chair.
You stopped me a lot sooner than
I thought. Um so, essentially,
I've felt for quite some time.
Um and so has as my area that
there is a, um, a divide.
Within the state, and it's not
Republican versus Democrat. It
hasn't been Republican versus
Democrat. Um it's urban rural.
Um
In my neck of the words, it's
not uncommon to find a Democrat
who's pro gun. Um, who might be
pro life or share a lot of the
philosophical ideas and beliefs
that that I do. Um what? What we
find over and over is that the
rural parts of the state or
ignored
Um, it
It's becoming more and more
common as districts, especially
for the Legislature to become
more and more condensed into
urban areas. And so this is just
to ensure that if a small group
of counties will say
Chavez, Eddy and Lea, um, felt
even more and more left out,
ignored, unheard that they would
have the ability to either
create their own state or join,
um, a portion of another state
with people who think and
believe a little bit more in
line with with what they do. Um,
And with that all Stanford
questions.
Alright. We did not have anyone
sign up in support or
opposition, but anyone in the
audience like to raise their
hand indicate support.
Does anyone want to raise their
hand to indicate opposition?
Alright members of the
committee, Senator it easy piano
then Senator Bob. Thank you,
Madam Chairman just quickly.
Isn't this basically what the
civil war was fighting?
Um and no madam chair and
senator. I appreciate the
question cause a lot of people
do get confused. Do get confused
with with that, um so secession
being one of those words that we
just automatically go.
To that.
In our history, and it's It's
not a part of history that any
of us really enjoy talking
about.
This is about staying in the
union, but states shifting their
boundaries as needed. And that
was the intent. Why the U. S
constitution allows for this
because, as times change, it's
it's no different than time
zones. You might find out there
in the wrong the wrong place.
and so this is just to allow
areas to join with other areas
that, um, either fit their their
philosophy. Their economy.
Um the people align more with
each other. It's not to leave
the country. We're not leaving
the country or or, um, trying to
go against the United States.
It's just saying, Hey,
Chavez, Eddy and Lea. We don't
really feel like we
Fit much with the rest of New
Mexico. We'd rather hang out
with Midland and Odessa, and
then you form a statement. Thank
you, madam Chairman and Senator.
Yeah, I was being a little, uh,
What's the word facetious about
that? But but the but the real
issue is, um
Well, Texas take you.
Well, Madam Sharon, Senator? I
don't know. I don't know how
hard you guarantees to me. But
Must have been pretty hard, but,
um, you know, I would hope Texas
would take us it would complete
their their, um, monopoly of the
of the Permian Basin. Um, and so
I think they would probably
welcome us with open arms. But
wouldn't Madam chairman wouldn't
the Texas water policy deplete
the Ogallala even faster than
than it is being depleted now?
Well, madam Sharing and Senator,
um, the counties, which, of
course, um
I live in our part of the
artesian aquifer that's
replenish a ble.
Um, so I think that's another
part of
Um
An issue that would make them
Take us even quicker. I know
we've been in the litigation
with him for many years and, um,
but I don't want to get too too
far off topic because the issue
isn't whether Texas would take
us. Um it's really the fact that
Southeastern New Mexico.
Has been neglected and it's
going to continue to get
progressively worse as new
Mexico becomes more urbanized
along the Rio Grande corridor.
Um even areas of northern New
Mexico feel the same way even
though they align
With, say, the political party
that's in the majority, although
they they align philosophically.
They don't feel, um, like their
needs are being met by the state
with all the power centralized
into Santa Fe and Albuquerque.
So I think the real issue here
is, um, moving forward. This is
something that was put in the U.
S Constitution for good reason.
Um and I and I think it should
be taken seriously because as
areas get ignored, I think
that's when unrest becomes too
set in. Um there's there's real
issues that that come up.
And then we've seen just this
year. I didn't. I didn't even
get passed Senate Bill six and I
was cut off because it was. It
was pretty obvious that it it's
very heavy handed anti urban
legislation that's been
introduced and so I think it's
just an important point to make
that, um you know so much that
we do here become so politicized
that we really do ignore just
the simple fact that people want
to be left alone.
In their beliefs and not have
kind of, um, you know, Populist
vote can basically dictate how
you you run your life, and I
think that's
Really why we had a Republican
form of government in this state
many years ago, where Colfax
County would have had one
senator the same as as Berna,
Leo to ensure that all the state
the entire area of the state,
um, had a voice and a say much
like we do The real issue. Madam
chairman seems to be then one
man. One vote is what
One person when voters is really
the issue because there's more
people in the urban areas you
feel like they shouldn't
necessarily get more assistance.
What Madam chair and Senator, I
don't disagree with the way it's
set up. I'm just saying history.
That's why it was set up that
now, obviously, we're all gonna
believe in one man. One vote
because with that constitutional
amendment was really about
Is what the Democrats Southern
states were doing by only, UM,
allowing African American and so
that that amendment was to
ensure that regardless of race,
color, creed, sexual orientation
or anything that within whatever
district you were voting in your
vote counted the same as a
strongly support that and I
would never say that somehow
that was a mistake. The mistake
that was made
Um, is when we took away
basically the the Senate, which
was the representation of area
and the House of Representatives
was the people's house, and we
lost that balance. And so I
think
For years. We kept that balance
by by having individuals elected
from both parties that that
we're willing to compromise and
come together and sometimes I
would look over my shoulder and
go. What is my Republican
compadre thinking and you would
do the same with some of your
Democrat cohorts and I've seen
just in the last four years due
to a faulty primary process that
you end up with the extremes on
both sides, which basically
means there will be no
compromise and everything is
Voted on submitted just for the
headline in the newspaper.
Well, Madam chairman, I would
suggest that when hurting county
was 1800 people had one senator
and Burnley a county was
600,000 at one senator.
To the weeds on this, But I just
think, um
That that that that New Mexico
is is a whole.
And that there are parts of this
state that that are very
different from other parts, But
we do share a commonality a
common history.
And I would hate to see that
getting fragmented because of
individual political beliefs,
life guns or individuals. Those
things come and go.
But the history of New Mexico
has been one of
Shared heritage and I would like
to think it's important that
Roswell important that, uh
I think it's particularly
important that Lee County is
part have 5 billion reasons.
There's 5 billion reasons a
year.
But but I think we are and and
and we should pay attention to
the rural parts of the state. I
could not, uh
I agree more with you than that,
Um
That is absolutely crucial, and
that's what you and and and
other people from rural parts of
made sure
Meat inspection being 111
example. Just this year.
I don't know anything about meat
inspection. It's probably not
going to have any impact in
Burnley or county to a great
extent, but it certainly is
important to people in rural
parts of the state. We got it
done.
So I think we have to work
together on these things. I
guess that's what I'm saying.
Thank you. Thank you, Senator.
Short. Thank you, madam Chair.
I'm sure you remember my
comment, which was printed in
the paper last year or year
before when you brought this.
Somebody made a plaque of it, so
it's hanging up in my best, But
I want to read you something
So Article four, Section three
Clause one of the U. S
Constitution.
Says New states may be admitted
by the congress into this union,
but no new state shall be formed
or erected within the
jurisdiction of any other state.
Nor any state before me by the
junction of two or more states
or parts of states without the
consent of the legislatures of
the states concerned as well as
of Congress. So you bypassed the
New Mexico Legislature with this
joint resolution.
So just a little. It's on our
analysis. You'll get it so it
seems like you probably should
have passed it through the
Legislature.
That's all my chair. Thank you,
Senator Baca. Oh, Senator
Neighbor.
Thank you, madam Share.
Um Madam Chair and Senator.
The the issue of
This is used not unique to New
Mexico, is it?
And Madam chair and Senator. No,
it's not. I think San
Bernardino. Um portions of
Washington, Oregon. Um, a lot of
the the states along the West
Coast, really most of the states
west of the Mississippi size.
There's such a diversity and in
view and commerce within these
states that a lot of the areas
do feel the need to maybe join
with and so I, It's not
New to New Mexico by any means.
In fact, there's many areas of
California that feel separated
Um Madam chair and senator. In
fact, you hear some talking El
Paso that it's closer to five
other capitals than it is to the
capital Santa Fe being one of
them.
And folks in El Paso feel like
they are ignored by their own
state government. So it uh it is
something that I think
Affects a lot of areas of the
West, um and large, largely due
to geography and distance to
The seats of government and and
also as you point out
Generally more rural in nature.
Um
If this
If this were to pass and become
part of the Constitution.
Uh huh.
Well, we also not as Senator
Stewart, uh, pointed out, you
would still need to
Get the consent of both Texas
and New Mexico Legislature for
that to to move forward, would
you not?
And Madam chair and Senator.
Yes, that that that's correct
and then Congress
And then, of course it's written
in here. I think it
Didn't need to be being passed
in Congress work. They have to
be signed. That would be the
process, So I think,
essentially, it's um I mean,
starting off at the beginning
two thirds of the votes.
In each county.
So it would be an extremely hard
process A long road to hoe.
As you could say, um, but
You know, I think it's only if
actions by this body becomes so
egregious.
To these specific areas that
action like this is the last
Effort that they think they have
to protect and maintain their
culture and their lifestyle.
And so, madam Chairman, Senator
this
Constitutional amendment would
simply
Set into place. The
Procedures by which the counties
could then
Begin a process.
But ultimately state
legislatures.
Two.
Enter into an agreement.
To allow for any changes in
that.
Correct.
Senator Morris. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you, Senator For
the last 12 years. I've really
enjoyed spending the money that
comes from your neck of the
woods. So I moved the table,
All right. We have emotions
stable.
Ah, Is there any objection to
that? Yeah. All right. Let's
show center, Balkans and her
Pirtle objecting as
Okay. Senators, Baca, Nyberg and
Pirtle objecting and other
members vote voting in the
information. Go ahead, Senator.
Thank you, Madam Chair. And what
a surprise. That motion is from
all right. Thank you. All we we
We are going to be meeting in
this room at 1130 on Sunday to
get through our last four
confirmations. Um
We're and go ahead, Senator,
Phonics manager in the event
that we would finish those
confirmations. Could we schedule
that? Um
Joint resolution substitute.
Just at the end of the thing
that at the end of the agenda to
see if we even have time.
Uh, you know, Senator if we have
time? Sure. Um, we're only
giving ourselves an hour and a
half to get through four
confirmations, two of which are
Cabinet secretary. Okay, I'm
guessing we're thank you plan to
address next week, going down
the final stretch.
Um, uh, primarily, it'll be to
address house bills that come
over and in that last week, so
we Sunday is our last day of
doing confirmations. So we're
really just holding Monday for
her house bills and then
Wednesday. Yeah, there's some
emergency manager. Yeah.
Alright, We're in recess. Thank
you all.
