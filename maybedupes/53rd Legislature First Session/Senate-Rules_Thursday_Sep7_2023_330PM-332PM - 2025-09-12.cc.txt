Okay.
The.
The only
ones.
So it looks like the
the last person of the
day we're we're
not able to get a hold of
them and so we're not sure
if if that individuals coming
today or not
and so we're going to go ahead
and recess for the
today
and this
individual we will reschedule
for another time
either tomorrow
or when we meet
again for confirmations in
November
but otherwise we will be back
tomorrow
to finish out to
confirmations
for this 2 day
meeting and we will
see folks tomorrow
starting at about
9 we
are in recess until that.
