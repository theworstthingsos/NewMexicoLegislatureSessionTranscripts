Representative Powdrell Culbert.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
delay lady from Bernalillo you.
Madam speaker I will yield to
the gentle lady from Santa thank
you madam speaker I just have
one question for clarification
earlier in the day you were
talking about the brandishing of
a firearm.
And the
Thank.
Of the on the sentencing I just
want a little more
clarification because you had
wanted to run this brandishing a
firearm during the commission of
a crime.
So on the one area.
And then brandishing.
Of our armed.
Is right.
So we're I was a little bit
confused is.
I'm hearing brandishing a
firearm.
You know is in one category but
brandishing a firearm and then
using that in the commission of
a crime falls.
someplace else in the code so
I'm just asking for
clarification.
Madam speaker gentle lady
So.
Page ten section subsection B.
is the penalty enhancement for
a firearm that was brandished
and that is an increase of three
years and the penalty.
The question I believe that
you're referring to with the
word used that's what we just
struck with the amendment and
that was in section five Hey.
And so for Madam speaker gentle
lady for clarification purposes
we removed the word.
Used and Rick left possessed.
Okay and madam speaker gentle
lady.
Is there a difference in the
sentence.
Not in my mind again I can
brandishing the firearm.
But.
I don't commit.
A crime.
So from brands in the far are
in committing a crime.
In this gun has been used in the
commission of a crime is there a
difference in the amount of time
that an individual will have to
do.
Madam speaker gentle lady to
clarify the question is what's
the in hand the the sentence
enhancement the additional years
it would be three years if you
brandish a firearm in the
commission of a non capital
felony.
Okay all right thank you.
Seeing no further debate the
gentle lady to close.

In terms of the question around
the age for younger people it

Was it because of the liability
cost around that do you know.
I'm Madam speaker gentle lady we

hundred thirty four to deals
with the.
Of the sports authority division
of the tourism department to
revitalize the sports authority
this money and house bill two.
And this is the statue component
and without all stand for
questions.
Seeing some debate.
The representative of the
gentleman from San Juan.
Thank you madam speaker does the
gentleman from Bernalillo yield
better speaker yes.
Of Madam speaker and and
gentleman was this part of
are you re instituting something
that existed before is this
brand new agency speaker Jeff
thank you madam speaker
gentleman's from San Juan
existed before and it's still
good law it's so we have a legal
duty to revive this division was
placed within the there was
created I think in two thousand
twenty two thousand four to move
over to the tourism department
as an official division in two
thousand seven but it's better
to fund for over ten years now.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman so
In the past what we've into a or
in the last ten years I should
say
we've got focused on tourism for
sports for sporting events I
know you are a big New Mexico
sporting history buff of what in
the past has been in New Mexico
and what things are going on in
the state even now that this
could potentially highlight.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
from San Juan New Mexico has a
strong history of sports in fact
the one the world boxing
heavyweight championship.
Was in Las Vegas New Mexico back
in the day with old NC double a
track and field championships
got chairmanships of golf the
most famous of college
basketball game in history was
in the path NC state versus
Houston.
What one of the programs that
came out of the sports authority
back in the days now The New
Mexico bowl owned by ESPN the on
the Saturday before Christmas
but I think one of the great
favorites is the kind of
mackerel series in your neck of
the woods it's essentially a
little World Series but for
fifteen sixteen year olds and
I've lost count there's about
sixty eight major league
ball players that played in the
Connie Mack World Series in
Farmington New Mexico.
Thank you madam speaker and.
Gentleman I I know you brought
this up earlier this year but
the the gym the gentleman who
actually has been
running cutting back will World
Series for the last several
years is the brother of the
policy more I'll let you
describe that just a bit because
I guess first phone call I got
about to the hall of fame or
Ralph nearly passing was from
you so madam speaker and and
gentlemen would you briefly
discuss a little bit about the
the World Series Richard you and
Ralph maybe.
Thank you madam chair from San
Juan Raul the native brothers.
Which is the gentleman that went
to a local Rolf.
So Ralph is a storybook story
book of.
A life of born and raised in
Farmington played high school
ball in funding to Mexico one
two then one of the well then
and now great national power
open the Sooners was a two time
all American and then played for
the Dallas Cowboys one of the
the great links between New
Mexico and then Dallas Cowboys
his brother is a tremendous
Committee leader in up in
Farmington and then now is the
executive director in hosting
the fundamental series just a
wonderful of brotherhood in a
condolences to the family of of
the recent passing of Mr need.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman as well as from what
we what you we've just discussed
will obviously the agenda of
Anna's biggest moment in sports
here it happened in the pit and
we had years of of great NCAA
play here
but Madam speaker and gentleman
could this fund also be used or
could this.
And now that we at are adding
this back into tourism would
would be able to highlight other
things such as rodeo and maybe
so the horse racing events that
take place all across New
Mexico.
From San Juan I believe so I
believe so once the sports
authority gets up and running I
think you can build
relationships with our with our
college teams we have a
fantastic high school
organization and M. A. A. that
does some of the best state
tournaments in the country are
great little leagues from soccer
field basketball baseball
women's sports as well as as
young men sports so the hoax
forced a big hit as well as
everything did during the COVID
this will help revise it not
only for our young people for
our local economies with the
infants that'll help organize
thank you madam speaker I
appreciate the gentleman bring
this forward I think that all of
our communities are better plan
we're able to invite people to
our communities eat in our
restaurants stay in our hotels
you madam speaker and and and
and gentleman selling County the
so many other things that are
that are there sports fishing
and we actually have
world renowned rock climbing
events that take place there for
for four wheel rock climbing
events and so madam speaker and
gentleman I I do appreciate this
I think this is been overlooked
for far too long and I
appreciate your persistence in
trying to champion New Mexico
sports and the the it tourism
and it is it is a great place
for for the this focus to be in
this year madam speaker and
gentleman we Senator the Connie
Mack World Series being played
in New in Farmington New Mexico
in August this year will be
featured on CBS of to a national
audience the championship game
we've had people come through
Farmington Ken Griffey junior

a parade of the National League
talent that has come through so
I appreciate it once again thank
you for bring this for.
The gentleman from Santa Fe.
Speaker does the kind gentleman
from Bernalillo yield madam
speaker yes thank you madam
speaker and gentleman.
Can you tell me the current
structure of this board is it
not like twenty four twenty five
members and and how that's
changed in this bill.
Thank you madam speaker the from
Santa Fe the current
instructions board is nothing
because the board has not
existed for over a decade in
statute however.
The board was made up of several
cabinet secretaries including
the super and as well as a
superintendent RLD.
A couple of a staff of the
governor's office working with
the current secretary of tourism
really excited about that we you
know reinvigorating this
division the bill cuts it to
seven public members which is
consistent with other boards
within the tourism department.
Mr chairman that's that's
amazing and I mention these
public members to get to produce
a marsh or are such for their
service thank you madam speaker
of this on the wall and
corrective known.
Yes vested interested volunteer
but they do get per diem as they
should Senator and gentleman so
so would be fair to characterize
this bill as not only getting
this government entity doing
what it's being what what the
legislature just passed the to
do.
But also decreasing the size and
potentially without the cost so
with this be.
A good who decreasing government
to make it more efficient bill.
The figure of the loan from
Santa yes this districts big
government and makes it more
streamlined and effective to
work with the private sector
thank you madam speaker and
gentleman any little TV staff
will will take that as a victory
okay last question who said
Madam speaker and gentleman.
Every champion was once a
contender who refused to give
up.
Madam speaker gentleman from
Santa.

correct this is one of these
very few bills that actually is
a benefit to our New Mexico
small businesses.
And actually is a slight revenue
generator for the state I'm
happy to explain the details of
that it's a little complicated
but it's based off of the
changes to the state local
taxation policy that happened a
couple years ago during the.
What's the the job back to
something whatever the TCGA was
for the defense did a couple
years ago this is a slight
modification to the state level

Gentleman from Cibola and

I'm sorry gentleman it's house
bill two four three are you
ready on that item.
Thank you Mr speaker I am but
the record reflect all action
necessary for placing House Bill
two four three on final passage
has been taken the general to
explain the bill.
Did you do two things at the
same time.
There I am okay Mister speaker
members of the house house bill
two forty three.
House labor there is a military
affairs committee substitute for
house bill two forty three is a
very simple way of how the the
our retirees retirees are easy
are right in.
Retirees state employee to keep
their jobs and be able to
qualify for a one hundred
percent three dire meant.
With the same process that they
would today at ninety percent
with that Mr speaker I stand for
voice there is debate the gentle
lady from Otero.
Thank you Mr speaker and Mr
chairman does the gentleman from
the lan yield.
Mr speaker I yield to the gentle
lady.
Thank you gentlemen and and
thank you Mr speaker
soon gentleman.
Does this bill require that all
of her employees must work that
additional time were they still
eligible to retire at their
current years in service.
Speaker gentle lady all this
bill does is allow you to stay
and get the one hundred percent
retirement at the same level
that you would today at ninety
percent to get everything else
in the bill everything else in
your retirement program stays
the same it doesn't touch
anything but the top end where
if you state the a moderate
years that you would normally
stay for ninety percent
retirement now you will get that
retirement you will get the for
those years you will get a
hundred percent.
On your retirement.
Thank you gentlemen thank you Mr
speaker I'm German I'm kind of
curious why was this done any
bill I mean can I ask that.
Mr speaker a do you know you
know what we wouldn't through in
house labor.
The session I'm in the beers how
many meals did we hear to I work
at a waste to retain and the
continue to keep people on the
job.
I'm reading of.
Thank you about something like
this but I never could put it
together and then finally it's a
dummy bill because of the what
about one of the bill of the one
of the generic meals that is the
same to me as soon as a chairman
so that I can bring up the bill
like this after I have a
brainstorm.
And thank you for that the
gentleman and and I guess I will
conclude my questions thank you
Mr speaker.
Thank you gentle lady next to
the gentleman from Valencia.
Thank you Mr speaker does the
gentleman from single McKinley
yield.
Mr speaker gentle from the lives
that I yield.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentleman from McKinley.
I have a couple questions to
point out.
that I brought up actually
committee the other day.
Thank you the questions are
really about.
The the solvency of the power of
fund okay right now when we talk
but through the day can can you
talk about the current solvency
in the issues that this bill may
create.
Mr speaker and gentleman well
into I am not an expert on the
solvency but I do want you to
know that the analysis that we
got that we should be in there
this morning the analysis that
we got shows that my fashion
this legislation it.
All right funding just a slew of
their I mean it doesn't help
that much but it helps improve
it just is like I said like they
said though we just a slew of
they're like one third of one
percent there are not a student
there Luber.
Thank you Mr speaker as speaker
thank you gentleman from
McKinley the second question I
have is the also the point of
the bill is at thirty one years
they would get a hundred
percent.
It's also my understanding is
that they would continue every
three years to get a Cola cost
of living increase from a points
anywhere from a point zero five
two point three percent.
Mr speaker of the gentleman that
is happening in today's world
that is for discontinuing to
happen this this not change
anything at all if you get a
goal of two days of your
retirement you will continue to
get your goal are we did not
touch anything at all in that
area all we've got to is that of
ninety percent to a hundred
percent.
Does it just comedy from
Bernalillo Representative trio
here of would you please mute
your microphone.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentleman from McKinley County
my only what if this is the it's
just for statement and I didn't
understand about the power and
for these the employees are
there but the other thing I want
to bring up the buzz is here to
be in for teachers as well.
Because in order for the
educated to get the same hundred
percent.
We have to put in a total forty
three years.
And that the the percentages of
retirement based upon the thirty
one years would be seventy two
percent of four teacher has
opposed to a hundred percent for
the peril.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen for McKinley.
Next we have the gentleman from
New Dona Ana grant and Sierra
Representative Terrazas.
Yes Sir Mr speaker with the
kinds of women please yield.
Gentleman yield growth on and
he's only going to be able to
keep it on the same zoom
background you had last night.
Well Mister speaker I to wake up
the whole body last night Mr
speaker.
Thank you generously you
randomly random all night Mr
speaker so thank you I was glad
I could help and in general
everybody unless like Jennifer
and use your friend Jefferson
and you are and we appreciate
you all of participating with us
in good fun we appreciate you
and your contributions gentleman
thank you very much and the
floor is yours questions thank
you Mr speaker again I'm glad
that I can use people very
easily Mr speaker gentleman we
we spoke this morning on in in
our committee
Mr Chairman concerning this.
Issue and and my question was my
understanding through our debate
was that.
We'll have to work for three to
five more years in order to
receive a hundred percent did I
misunderstand that this morning
Mr speaker Jim Baker Dylan is
yes you what what it is is you
will just work whatever you are
working now if you are working
now a new virgin up to that
extent where you retired at
ninety percent of you say those
extra three years or whatever it
is that's on your plan okay
every plan is different that's
use the example of three years
if you were that age for the
three years now instead of
retiring and ninety percent you
will retire at a hundred
percent.
Okay thank you Mr speaker
gentleman because that's that's
not what I understood when
settle for if you everything
remains the same and you get a
hundred percent but then in
committee it's it's what we you
just to discuss right now Mr
speaker gentleman it was that if
you work three to five years
depending on the fair plan you
would you would you would be
fine so the last question was
the only other question the well
ask a few things but my main.
Question was because of the fire
that was that we didn't have
The solvency issue and the bond
rating for New Mexico because
does have a big impact on our on
our bond rating thank you if you
can just explain that real quick
Mr speaker gentleman that's the
only other question I have.
The girl and gentleman this does
not affect the bond rating if
you remember this morning like I
told the gentleman earlier this
does help the B. R. A. fund just
a little bit it doesn't help
that much but it does help.
And that's about it but I have
nothing nothing to do with the
money bond rating or anything at
all.
Thank you Mr speaker Jim and I
just the the solvency was the
only issue I had I think one of
the other representative.
Representatives also had so
that's the only questions I had
thank you very much Mr speaker
Jim of.
Thank you John this further
debate the gentle gentle lady
from McKinley and San Juan.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman yield.
Speaker are you really able to
lay laid by the neighbor down
the hallway from me.
Mr speaker and gentleman I'd
like to know what this is going
to cost and if this is the
general fund expense.
Mr speaker and gentle lady this
is not a general fund expense
number one it is not going to
cost anything because what it
does there's a people in our
staying on to work longer years
are going to put more money into
B. R. A. and they will retire at
a the.
I'm gonna say this an older age
so they will be in the
retirement program for a few
years less than they were
before.
There is a loss to to to or at
all to the general fund.
Mr speaker
general the general fund match
state employees.
Mr speaker are you Mr speaker
gentle lady yes it does but then
again like I said they both this
people will continue working
this like they do now.
Both funds will continue going
in instead of hiring new people
they will just keep these people
on for a longer period of time.
Mr Mister speaker John what what
are the FIR say the total amount
was going to be.
Fund arses.
There were in the moderate
neutral to positive impact the
lives of the.
So there is no specific dollar
amount.
Speaker gentle lady non.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentleman.
Actually the generality for
Santa Fe Representative Lujan.
Thank you Mr with a kind
gentleman yield.
Mr speaker I yield to the gentle
lady from some stuff a in.
Yes yes yes in your I just want
to ask Miss speaker real quickly
and I think some of the
questions are covered by
chairman Mr but.
Mr chair Mr speaker and
gentleman is this for all state
employees.
It is not for Mr speaker and
gentle lady from Santa Fe this
is for all employees that are
covered under their off.

Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman gentleman I I'm not

know you're reading off one is
an official FIR or.
Can you help me understand that
I'm I'm like the chairman of the
chair lady of a HFC for and when
you increase the amount
available it appears to me that
it would have an impact.
And I I would like to like to
know how this was vetted and and
if that's actually an official
FIR from LFC does have a lot of
unanswered questions because
this just popped up out of
nowhere to very late date and
I'm concerned that it may not be
well vetted and and
I don't have vote for something
and then find out later I
shouldn't have so.
It is the FIR you're looking at
an official document from LFC.
Mr speaker and gentleman it is
however I myself like everybody
else's up.
The FIR is the FIR is requested
for the committee chair and it
is released after it is first
