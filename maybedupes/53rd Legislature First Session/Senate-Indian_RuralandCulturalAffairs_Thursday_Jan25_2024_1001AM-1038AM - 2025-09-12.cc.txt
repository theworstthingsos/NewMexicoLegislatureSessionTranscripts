Those that are in the r.
As we move forward
I don't really.
Thank you madame chair and
thank you so much for hearing my
bill today i'm senator pat woods
and seven representing
curriculum union counties and
it's always applaus.
Simple bill for a very complex
problem is certainly done
addressed the whole problem but
it starts in a direction that I
hope helps
the bill as you see is a one
page bill it has an emergency
calls it appropriates fifty one
million dollars
to the department of health for
the expenditure in financial
year twenty twenty four and
twenty five uh to provide
emergency furning for rule and
front here
hospitals with fear beds with
fear than thirty five bids and
any uh unencumbered ballots will
be reverted.
Just a a brief explanation uh
we are trying to assess rule
hospitals made we have changed
many practices funding hospitals
now it's it's a lot more like
we've found by the number of
patients that go with.
And our problem with many of the
rural hospitals is that the
declining populations were just
don't have an enough patient
going in to to pay all the bills
and other laws have been changed
uh many of the malpractice
insurance costs have gone up
what mobile tribes to dress is
just a open the door type
payment
that you will just put so much
money per hospital financial
year just to get the doors open
we are in diary of these health
centers out there in the role
area
I have got a list of those
hospitals
and the sad part of it is to
those hospitals are in my
particular district and
rose about county hospital is
right out of my district these
are uh these hospitals need help
and i'm trying to figure out how
to do that and I hope
this money will go in the
department of health to do just
what I mentioned
I will
I will be happy to answer any
other questions that may come.
Thank you.
I have several witnesses in the
room I think if they would just
stand in and if you would allow
them uh you're normal time I
think they could probably
explain and a pretty short time
where their problem lies.
By will kind of gauge it by show
pans at first those that are in
opposition to the bill please.
Those that aren't supported
those data and support if you
would if you would like.
Like.
My name is.
I came from the southern.
Um i've been there for almost
nine years we have done a lot of
amazing.
But what you see is a community
that is almost fifty percent.
We are also a large.
Which is eighty four miles away
as a nurse I know.
Or a trauma thing on that road
that you're not going to make it
to the next hospit.
What happened to our hospital
financially
i'm just gonna give you a really
high level of that but see
amounts that the federal level
has made some changes with how
many.
The.
Many.
In my community is one of those
we have a lot of ranchers day
workers and elderly people who
are on.
But our medicaid population is
hardly anything so we have went
from two to three million
dollars in medicare matching
funds or what would be known.
Down to two h.
I mean that alone.
Now we have done things to
protect ourselves against that
by trying to get more services
there but there are some
services that either are above
our level of expertise or we
just don't h.
I have some priorities providers
that come.
But to get other providers.
The other thing that has heard
us is that since covered the
price of medication and supplies
has gone up around thirty five
percent or more in some areas I
don't have the ability to.
One of the bigger things that's
heard us is the price of
staffing in order to.
We end up paying a little bit.
The other thing is trying to
find nurses.
In new mexico when we are
working really hard with our
state to try to work on that but
the shortage of nurses and the
the cost of salaries have gone
up and I don't want to go way
too far into this but I want you
to know what our premiums.
We used to pay a hundr.
General liability and
professional liability this year
I could only find two quotes
quotes out of almost seventy
companies that I went out to to
try to find insurance one was at
one point eight million and one
was at eight hundred thousand I
have no.
Last year and these are the
prices and i'm also a component
of the county therefore
protected from the tort claims
act but with the number of
insurance companies leaving the
state my p.
In that alone with everything
else.
I mean they deserve.
Emergency
practice care in patient care
swing bed care.
Madame chairman members of the
committee mission for us may not
be happening mexico cattle
gore's in mexico war goods we
stand in strong support as sb
fifty two health care in a real
communities is in desperate need
of this appropriation the real
life stories in rural new mexico
about health care are just get
riching about the delays the
weight times the lack of staff
in doctors that we can go in and
see this appropriation is
definitely needed and we support
fifty two and a personal amount
my dad has had many many
accidents in we are sixty five
miles from a hospital the
closest hospital did not have
doctors and we had to go across
county lines are state lines to
get them really to save us like
so we desperately need these
moneys in real community.
Good morning again madame
chairman was the committee once
again my name is mike miller i'm
a regional obvious four rose
about general hospital and for
talents and norley general
hospital in lovington
I think the ceo here gave a very
good explanation of what the
issues are
and why this funding is needing
needed
you know the the reimbursement
rates have not kept up with the
inflation of all the things that
she spoke of earlier
hopefully we have a bill coming
later in this session it might
raise those upper limits but
it'll be a few years before that
may be available so this is a a
stop get measured that I think
was very important to keep the
doors open in these hospitals
again on a personal note I am
lived in port I live in
portallis i'm actually the mayor
in port I will tell you we went
they shut her hospital down
several years ago we struggled
for a lot and we finally were
able to put together a special
hospital district but that
hospital together I think
lovington went through a similar
problem years before they
and you know as as my position
my other position that we all
know that health care is very
important to a community to the
economic development I urge you
to support senator which bill
thank you.
Right.
Thank you madame chair and I
think the issue is that
these hospitals are having is
just going to be something
that's going to expand to to
larger hospitals as well if we.
In the cautious.
The.
But if you can't give your
insurance c.
In any if there's a if there's a
single ve.
Proud to hear that there has
been.
That could be extraordinarily
damaging to.
Hospital and almogordo and
advance of wounded people with
well over twenty millio.
So I don't know how union.
Only could handle.
That a shy that's that's that
that's the issue that there
but these guys are ha.
In their too far.
From major population
so I think it's an important
that we
we agree to move senator would
be all forward so more people.
Any questions.
That mean what is th.
No i'm just I just you know
unfortunate to live
in a.
But I break.
Does not have don't does not
have those choices.
Impressed.
The.
It is a really
end and in fact one things that
I hear from folks
in the earth where we have
military basis is that one of
the issues around her military
basis actually is that they.
Because myself is medical care
the moral areas of our state
which includes out we're settled
as from as well as a lot of the
area where you represent center
woods on their bucks.
And that the the military
insurer spending millions of
problems transporting people out
of state to get health care that
they're not.
That if we could get our world
hospitals.
It is to be able to have some of
the some of the
availabilities
to be able to provide care for
folks it wouldn't have to do
that and it would also make it
easier to have some of the
families move out people who
might have kind of conditions
frankly who know that they're
gonna need care and and.
Thank you manager
and think.
It's going back to its right so.
Senator for the question.
The reason I picked up five a
fifty one million dollars it was
just kind of a shot in the dark
initi.
This deal is if I could if I
would have said you know five
million dollars to union county
you can't really do that start
with this but
it does not bring out the fact
of how many
small hospitals are energy
and this is just the first maybe
a little bit of a stop get so
that we can pass another bill
that we have going uh uh beyond
one sixty one senate bill one
sixty one that goes into a
little more detail on on what we
need to do but it can't.
So if we can disc.
If if how can I say this.
If we close
the hospital in claim
could we ever reopen.
If we can keep it open until we
could figure out a funding
formula to help these people
then we can keep it going
and it's the same with every one
of these small hospitals is how
can we just keep him open one
more year until we figure out
something on how to achieve a
funding source to keep ruin to
mexico
with with some kind of critical
care out there that so
important.
Thank you for that center and I
do understand the severe.
All the rule.
And we heard senator mo.
So that moves them all.
Really appreciate.
You really need to.
That are there are throughout
the state and.
You know still be out there.
Senator greeks yes
senator abuse total
yes
synergy centers yes senator
schendo
excuse senator neil yes
senator pinto yes.
The.
I am after serious finance and I
would appreciate you you
gentlemen lobbying on my behalf
and in my chairman if you could
lobby on my on behalf I would
really appreciate that
and we will
maybe maybe thursday for those
we'll see if any other bills
have been read out and referred
to this committee as we move
forward but I think.
Yeah.
