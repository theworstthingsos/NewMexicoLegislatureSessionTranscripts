Thank you madam.
Gentlelady to explain the bill
thank you madam speaker all
little tired right now but do
not shell Senate Senate bill one
fifty is a product of at
actually a Federal Cremins that
at the time president trump made
with reinsurance companies that
they wanted to make that level
the playing field and so in
states like New Mexico we have a
statutory requirement that
foreign reinsurance companies
must offer capital in the exact
same amount as the reinsurance
that they're offering so for
instance madam speaker if you
have Lloyds of London offering
every insurance policy for forty
million dollars they then have
to prove to the OSI that they
have forty million dollars and
the bank and so to cut short
madam speaker we are not in
compliance of federal policy we
need to change that language in
the statute so that foreign
reinsurers are have the same
standards as domestic reinsurers
and with that I stand for
questions.
I see there is debate the gentle
lady from Bernalillo

gentleman from Bernalillo please

Thank you madam speaker of the
members this is Senate joint
resolution ten which would
provide an extension of the
lease between US Mexico New
Mexico state fair.
And the downs of Albuquerque the
downs of Albuquerque was shut
down because of the pandemic for
proximity mines.
They have no qualms about paying
the rent during that time
however agreement has been
reached to.
To extend the committee.
Ten extra years but it needs
legislative approval and with
that I stand for questions there
is debate the gentleman from
Chavis and Lincoln counties
Representative Nibert thank you
madam speaker will the gentleman
from Bernalillo county yield
Madam speaker yes.
Madam speaker and gentle lady I
mean Madam speaker and gentleman
the
interesting thing about this
that I learned during the course
of our discussions was a.
The owner of the Albuquerque
downs as maybe not only a small
investment but a substantial
investment in upgrading those
facilities on state lands and
and madam speaker and gentle and
gentleman which is by the tell
us about that investment and the
the the type of money that the
owner has been out of pocket for
improving those facilities.
Thank you madam speaker.
Gentleman from Chavis Lincoln no
you're correct I think what we
learned in one of the committees
was investments of north of
twenty two million dollars to
the grandstands the the
facilities the.
Surrounding the the track and
and just make it more enjoyable
for tourists and for and for
horse lovers and for for
filmgoers to enjoy that down
there at all because you're
correct it is a state facility
but private money has gone into
upgrading that facility and
making it really top notch.
Madam speaker and gentleman as I
stated in committee.
I thought the.
The person making that type of
investment on property owned by
the state would probably want
longer than a twenty five year
term extension to their to their
lease but that's what was agreed
on and I certainly support the
legislation thank you for
bringing to Madam speaker and
gentleman.
The gentle lady from Travis
county Representative Ezzell
Madam speaker thank you very
much for the gentleman yield
please.
Speaker I yield.
Madam speaker I just want the
crowd to know what
happened fund over the COVID
contrary Act Harris said in
whenever the racetracks were
shut down.
Because there were two tracks in
our state during that time frame
went ahead let those equine
athletes run and it was the all
American Ruidoso downs and the
downs at Albuquerque and I have
I would just want that recognize
because they did hold up to
their bargain without spectators
and without any help from the
casinos and it was very hard on
them but they understood the
importance of having those
athletes be able to trying and
to run and maintain those jobs
and all the trickle down effect
that goes with it madam chair

the clock for the otherwise we

Baldonado came and I became fast
friends
whenever I came in early on the
session he took me under his
wing so to speak we served on
house said together were served
on L. E. S. C. this summer.
And there's a couple things that
stand out to me with regard to
my friend Alonzo one of those
was his ability to handle
difficult conversations and
debates with members on the
other side and really but
gentlemanly but effective way I
had a very good way of letting
people know that you disagree
with them and the issues that he
had with whatever position
they're taking at the end of
that they were still colleagues
and they're still friends and I
respected him for his ability to
do that because I think that's a
lost art and politics Mr speaker
the other thing is
Representative Baldonado Alonzo
to me.
Have a lot of wisdom you know
he'd service place a long time
and in terms of how to approach
legislation out approach other
members how to handle the
political life and and I I'm
honored and I was on the first
people that he called
and I was surprised and saddened
but also happy for him and so I
know he's he's going to be a
friend well beyond my
legislative days in his well and

Thank you gentlemen I have an
announcement to make in the
final three minutes.
the members it has been my.
true honor and incredibly high
privilege of a lifetime to serve
as the representative in
district forty seven.
Since two thousand nine in as
your speaker since two thousand
seventeen.
I have truly enjoyed nearly
every minute of service that I
have given to the state into my
constituents as I sit here with
you today I am truly energized
by the potential of our great
state and firmly believe that
the future of New Mexico is
incredibly bright.
while I am excited about what is
next for our beloved.
New Mexico I must tell you that
this is the last time I will
speak to you from this rostrum
at the conclusion of a regular
legislative session.
I recently decided.
That I will not seek reelection
to the house and I will pass
this high office to a new
speaker in January.
this decision though recently
made has.
Then some time in coming.
Over the past year the time I
spend away from my family as a
result of my public service has
weighed on me more with each
passing day.
As my children get closer to
leaving home and going to
college for going on to is after
high school for them.
I want to take every opportunity
I can to spend as much time with
them as I can.
The is become clear to me that
it is time to put my young
family first.
And devote my full energy to
helping Kelly raise our girls.
It is also time for me to play a
supporting role.
To Kelly's dreams and work
issues done for me over the
past.
Thirteen years.
When I first decided to run for
the house I have a lot of ideas
for new laws and policies.
Over time my vision is changed
and hopefully of maturity at
least a little bit along the
way.
when I look back on the list of
goals I had for our state and
for all of us.
All the work that we've done
together to make New Mexico a
better place for everyone I
realize that.
Almost everything I ever hope to
achieve in this office and has
been accomplished.
And we've also been able to do a
heck of a lot more.
Together we have absolutely but
the people of New Mexico first
and then our state a better
place for everyone who lives
here.
Neither district forty seven and
won the speakership belongs to
me or to any person.
And looking back on the history
of this house speaker of this
chamber has not voluntarily
chosen to leave office since
nineteen sixty five.
For me it is truly never been
about the title it's been about
the work.
I believe in change and I
believe in giving others an
opportunity to lead.
As I look around this chamber
that I first joined in two
thousand nine I can say looks
very different today than it did
when I was a first term member.
Among all the things that we've
done I'm perhaps most proud of
the work that I and my team have
done to actively and mindfully
maker chamber more diverse more
welcoming.
And to be more focused on
outcomes and not politics above
all else.
I have also tried to follow
state general rule that one
should never take your work
seriously I'm sorry what should
ever take yourself seriously we
should always take your work
seriously.
As I announce my departure at
the end of this term has never
felt more true than right now.
I want you to know this
institution will be in good
hands.
The house of representatives.
You have so many members with
incredible potential as leaders
of our state and as leaders in
this chamber.
I will always be available to
you.
When and if you want to chat if
you need advice if you need
support.
If you want to talk about the
hard days and share the highs of
the good days.
And I will always count you as
my colleagues but more
importantly as my friends.
I also want to thank you for all
those times that you shared
advice with me for the times
that you supported me when I had
to make tough decisions.
And even for the times that we
disagreed.
It's in those moments that I've
learned so much from all of you
all of the members here.
Learn from the people you
represent and I want to thank
you for sharing all of your
lessons with me and helping me
become a better person and a
better father.
Finally there are so many people
to thank.
I can see here for.
Hours thanking all of the staff
thank you all of the people
who've made our work and our
success is possible.
but I want to thank.
One person in particular on our
staff.
Someone who live sometimes
referred to well first of all I
want to thank.
My family home.
my wife Kelly.
Is an incredible person and
since I first.
Decided to enter public service
she has stood by my side every
step of the way and I would not
have been able to any of this
without her on wavering support.
Want to thank my girls for
putting up with me being gone so
much.
In it was them that is motivated
as I said this decision.
in terms of our family here in
the legislature I have to thank
someone who I've often referred
to as my co speaker.
We anticipate.
And once again thank you all for
an incredible honor incredible
privilege to serve the people of
Mexico at your side thank you
