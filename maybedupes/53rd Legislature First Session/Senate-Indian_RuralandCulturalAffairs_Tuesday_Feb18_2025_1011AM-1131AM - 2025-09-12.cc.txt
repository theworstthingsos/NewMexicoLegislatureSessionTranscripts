So the Senate Indian Rural
Cultural Affairs Committee will
come to order me to please
take the
role.
>> Yeah, this with
the Chair. I can't
even tell
you.
>> Good morning. Thank you,
Senator Chip Pino
Pinto.
Um,
where do you want pencil?
>> Well, you're all here.
>> Senator
Maestas,
Senator Sanchez,
Senator Sheer,
Senator Souls,
Senator
Pinto.
There's a core.
>> Thank you. So,
on the agenda, we have
Senate Bill 316
when you Senate Bill
41 Senate Bill
276 and Senate bill
308 and
our floor time is at
1130.
So,
well, again,
Senator, >> thank you madam Chair,
Senate Bill 3 to 16
requires uranium waste
disposals and federally managed
underground facilities.
Uh, the issue of permits for
uranium disposal to federally
managed underground waste
depositories.
Currently, we have numerous sites
across New
Mexico. Uh,
that will have tailings that have
been moved. We'll get into
that in just one second.
But what are uranium tailings?
Uranium tailings are, are
radioactive toxics.
And by-product left after
uranium ore is processed
to extract
uranium. They contain
heavy metals, radium and other
long term
long lived radioactive
elements.
Haines, emit radon gas, which
is a health hazard linked to lung
cancer. Contaminants
are leashed into underground
water, uh affecting
drinking water supplies,
wind and water erosion
can spread the radioactive
dust and materials.
Uh waste depo deposit
methods and are tailing
polished large engineered
impounding
impoundments designed to
contain tailings and prevent
leaching dry
stacking is a newer method
to where dewater
tailings are compacted and
covered, minimize
environmental impacts and
underground disposal. In some
cases, tailings are returned
mind out areas to reduce
surface exposure.
The regulations and best
practices are
controlled by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, NRC
and the Environmental Protection
Agency to oversee
uranium waste
management in the US.
International organizations
like the International
Atomic Energy Agency
provide guidelines.
Beck's practices include long
term mining engineered
beers and site
reclamation efforts.
Long term uranium
management challenges or uranium
chains remain hazardous waste for
thousands of years
requiring perpetual
care cost
and responsibility for long term
commitments are often falling
on government and
taxpayers
climate change and extreme weather
events pose additional risk
to containment
structures,
innovations and future
considerations are using
plants to absorb and stabilize
contaminants which
is a
high
eating media process.
And so what that process is is they
take a machine, they run
the tailings through there. They
take 98 9, about
75% of the uranium
out, 25%
of, of precious
minerals come out.
And so you have
uh almost all the
uranium out and and
left it in the pallet
format. Uh advanced
containment lines to
prevent leaks and leaching
and new reactor technologies
to reclaim some of this and
some advanced nuclear reactors could
potentially use the waste as
fuel.
Currently, they transport
fuel uh
green waste uh
across the reservation
into Utah.
Uh and energy fuels
were uh
or
in the pinon
plane mind into
Arizona to white Mesa
in their bluff uni
are low
classified materials
and they are
under federal law, the lowest
level materials that they're taking
on the interstates from
Cameron up
to Utah through the US Force
Base service and the
transport's gonna take 2 to 4
years.
Uh What happens if there's an
emergency when a truck tips over?
If they're transporting waste,
they can only run certain hours a
day from 8:30 a.m. to
3:30 p.m. when kids are not
in school.
Um Are
there any additional benefits to the
Navajo Nation from this agreement?
Well, it removes it from
one place but it moves it to
another. Currently, there's
an EPA order
that takes the uranium
waste from
Church Rock which is right
outside of Gallup and
transports it 30 miles
to the
uh we're just
moving one Utan and waste
to another.
There's
no
both Navajos. All the Navajos
are not in support of this
EPA order. He said
that Navajos supported it,
they do not support it
um or taking it from
one family to another family
and, and currently putting
it in another place, they
could have moved it to Milan, which
has uh
aboveground
wet storage and
manages that facility
over 100 year
waste. Um But they have
chosen not to do that. And I think
the EPA has chosen not to listen
to the people
that live in that area.
Uh And they've chosen to take
it to a, a site
which I think they have cut a deal
on uh and try to
contain it in our where waste
dump is. Well, if anything
happens in that area, our water
is even more shallow in that
area. There's actually
uh Artesian wells that
exist in that area. That's how water
shallow the water table is
there. And so if we're gonna mov'e
it from one place to another, that's
not the way we want
it to happen. We want to
go a place where it's safe. We
want it back off the reservation
or the surrounding areas.
They're moving to Checkerboard
Lane, which is right
across the fence is, is Nava
Nation. And
so we're gonna
have to figure out how we're gonna handle
uranium waste in New Mexico.
Uh There is ways to
clean it up. There's better ways than
just take it from
11 stack
and stack it in another stack and
then, and then put
uh more people at
risk in their water table.
That
manager,
>> thank you, Senator.
So we will go to those
in the Committee room. Those that
are in support. Please raise
your
hand,
those that are in opposition.
Please raise your hand.
If you would like to make public comment,
please come up but be
mindful and of
your time there. Um But
please come up. Thank
you
>> here.
Oh, madam, Chair uh
Committee Members.
Uh My name is Larry King
and I uh reside
in Church Rock, New Mexico,
several miles north of Church
Rock on State road
566.
I stand here or
II, I opposed
the Senate bill
316.
Uh This bill
will be very detrimental
to our community.
It prevents clean up
to our community which our
community have been
advocating for many, many
years.
Um It mentions
uh that the, the bill
mentions uh
where
uh calls for uranium
waste uh to be
disposed of
only in a federally
managed underground
repository where there is no
such facility in the
US.
Um is also brought up
that the uh
uh
where the mine
waste uh the the waste
from Redwater Pond
or the former Kerr mcgee
K mine will be
transported to the Red Rock
landfill. Uh
We've uh mentioned
time and time again
that this
was, is not
uranium waste, it's not
tailings waste, it's mine
waste, nothing but
crushed rocks with
maybe a speck of
ra radioactive
material here and there.
Um We mentioned
that several times. Uh but
there's a huge difference in
this product that we're
trying to get out of our community
and our, they're literally in
our backyard, these contaminations
which we have been living for many, many,
many years.
Uh But
um so,
uh
um so
I am strongly opposed to
this bill three Senate Bill
316. Thank
you.
>> Good morning. Thank you, madam,
Chair and Committee. My
name is Teresita Kiana
and I come from the Redwater Pond
Road community
and I also sit on the
Executive Committee as
well in our community
and I, I opposed
the Senate bill 316
because my Children
deserve
to go home and be
safe. Our
community has been overlooked
for decades.
We've asked for clean up,
our community,
um wants
clean up and I
ask why
overlook us
again.
And so
I'm asking that
this not be
passed because
we deserve
to have our home cleaned
up and
we deserve to be
listened to and heard. We've
been talking about this
for years and years
and we deserve to be
respected as well.
We're people
and we deserve the same
thing that everybody else
wants,
wants to clean home, clean
environment and to be
safe. I have a
son who was born with a
heart murmur
and I have a daughter
who is 10 years
old and she's already
had three surgeries
in four different locations.
And those are skin
um nodules that she
keeps getting
and she is going
to be receiving
another surgery
because she has
another nodule
right on her neck and it keeps
growing. And so these are
things and issues
that are happening to people that
are living in
these contaminated
areas and if
the State is not going to clean
it up and
the federal government is not gonna
clean it up,
why,
why are, are you
overlooking our communities?
Why are you overlooking our
people? And
that's, that's our future right
there. My
Children are part
of that future.
If you guys don't care about
the State of our State
in its future,
then continue to overlook the
community. Go ahead.
But we're not gonna stop
fighting.
We deserve the same thing
that you guys all have
and all want
a clean home, a clean
environment and a
bright future for our
Children.
That's what I want for. My
Children. Thank
you,
>> Senator, the
Committee here. My name is
Brad
Laino. Spent 33
years in the military,
came back out as
an honor
and I live 200
yards from the waist right now
or at the mill that was
there.
And
I can see that it's still
seeping out in certain
places. We don't know how,
how highly
contaminated it's going
right straight to the ravine. That's
right next to it. That goes right
straight down through
gallop.
What the ditch going through there
before
I,
uh,
where's that? Right now?
It's not properly
lying.
It's not,
uh,
permanently place
there every
so often they have the
mind. Uh, the
EPA keeps
changing, adding the
sites so it doesn't
ero
ero
Abe
and where we are planning
to take to Red
Rock
facility, they
will have, they will build a
high
art State of the art
uh, facility for that
particular area
and they line it and everything
properly, how it's going to be
built and it's
gonna be on the north
east corner of that
landfill that they would
have. I'm,
my relatives is in,
in, uh, Peru
also
eos they,
they're not against it. I mean,
they're a little ways, quite
a ways from it.
And, uh, I don't
know where this, uh,
miscommunication is coming from.
That's a high, a
contaminant. So,
I don't know. All I know
is came from the school teacher
that was given to the
students and the students
came up with that letter. What
not, not understand
exactly what they are,
what it is.
So,
or like I said, I still
live there,
I guess seven
K there with the great
my grandkids.
So that's all I ask is we're
posing
the spiel
that boy
coming.
Thank
you.
>> Uh Good morning, everyone.
My name is Edith Hood.
I'm with the rat water pond root
community.
And
as Children,
we were
around there when the mining
itself came in
along with the drilling,
we were still living there when
they were all amongst us.
Not, not ever saying it
was dangerous or
anything.
And so it's, it has come
to this 50
years later, we're still
trying to ask to have it cleaned
up, but nobody
listens whoever
feels important. We
ask them to come to our
community, but
they don't show up,
not till something
happens and then they decide
to show up. So
I'm just wondering,
where are
these people?
Now?
We could have known about
these uh uh
laws
and these
things that are with the
NAO tribe,
the local
government
and especially the federal
government. Where
have they been?
We've been there 50 years
or so with the
mining.
We didn't even start to
get into that till that
uh 1979
spill.
My cousin and I
went and
sampled with
a sampling group.
That's when we find, we
got to find out it was
contaminated
and this is where it all started
in 2007,
we appeared in
Washington.
We appeared before the
Human rights
Committee and
yet nothing has
happened yet,
especially from our
government.
When are they gonna
start listening to us and
do something about it?
Thank
you.
Oops
>> Yacht.
A
is it Red? Ok.
Um
My name is Sarah Ataka.
I am a
long time
uh supporter of
Redwater Pond
community. I
am originally
from uh down
south, one of our satellite
communities uh
Raymond Navajo,
but I have been involved
with uh this community
since 2005.
As they learn
as they um
uh discover a lot
of areas that they
have um
uh come to
this point where they are
living in
a highly
contaminated
area. We've
done uh research
in that area under
uh Southwest Research and
Information Center and
also the University of New
Mexico uh
now that has
created a
larger component
with the University of New
Mexico call
Metals and
they um are focusing
on tribal
communities
uh to do um
any metal uh
contamination.
So I have seen
this community come
from uh
their grassroot level
learning about
uh the
contamination in their
area. And many
of them have participated
in the mining industry
themselves as well as
in the research
and finding out
that, that where
they're living at is not
a safe place.
And even if
um they
really try to stay
within the
community,
Majority of the
residents there has
now moved off and
they are expecting
it's gonna be temporary
because after the
cleanup of the mine
waste, they want to mov'e
back in because they have their
homestead is there? Their
homestead is still there.
Their houses are still
there. Uh
Some of them are boarded
up. Some of them come
home on weekends
to, um, check
around their homes and
there's no more animals.
They had sheep, they had
cattles, they had
uh, horses. Those
are no longer in
existence in the area. It's
a very sad, sad
place when I first
came into the community, it was
beautiful.
Generations were
there, Children,
our elders were there
and they learn with us.
But now every
year, little by
little, we, we started
seeing our
people um
passing on
and it, it's sad because
I've, I've seen this community
over 20 years working
with them and not
only within um
that community, but I
have worked within the
Eastern Navajo chapters
and also Navajo nationwide
on other research
pertaining to uranium.
And I really,
and uh I really
am uh
against this bill
because there is so
many different
parts in here that I
see that does
not uh
give any
um progress.
There's no funding
um available for
it. Um
The community of
Peru who is
um through their
local government is opposing
this but
uh the Majority of the
community there
um are
OK with it.
And I am
also genio
my son here
um Bradley
uh lives in the community
and I am also,
um, very wary
because he's the one that
is still sandwiched in
between the minor
waste there that needs to be
removed throughout the
years. We, they
have done a lot of,
um, um,
can, uh,
sort of clean up but it's
only a bandai kind of a
thing
uh removing soil
um three inch off,
you know, around their
homes. Um
Also
um uh
monitoring the air
there, the water
there, the soil
there, there's
it's highly contaminated
and
hopefully moving
this mining waste,
they will come back to a better
scenery because that
mining waste is not.
You wouldn't want it in your
backyard if you're
gonna think about
beautification around your
home. It's not like
that. So
um I just want
to tell you that
um uh
Mannose,
I I respect
your leadership, but
please
do. There's some
loopholes in here
that needs to be fixed
so that these people
can continue to live in the
healthy environment.
Thank
you.
>> Good morning madam, Chair and
Members of the Committee. My name is
Susan Gordon. I am
the coordinator for the
Multicultural Alliance
for safe environment.
And I've been working directly with the
Redwater Pond Road community
for 11 years
on uh January
7th, the
EPA, the
Navajo Nation and
the State of New Mexico
released a press
release that
was announcing
that EPA had signed an
action memo
to mov'e the Cora mine
waste to the red
rock landfill.
Um EPA has
100 and $87
million to have
this project mov'e
forward. The press
release includes
statements of support
from um Navajo
Nation President Bou
Nygren from the
Secretary of
um the
Secretary of the Environment
Department, James
Kinney.
So this is very much
AAA supported effort.
And um
if you have had a chance
to look at the fiscal impact
report for Senate Bill
316,
it's unfortunate that the way
it is worded, but it, it
will prevent any
uranium mine clean
up in New Mexico from
moving forward. It could
actually impact some
existing projects
like the homestake Barrett
gold site
in Milan.
Um It
as was mentioned
before, the mine ways
that we are talking about from
the Cuve site to
the red rock landfill
is
rock, it's dirt
that was removed from the,
from the shafts from the
pit and it
is not
uranium tailings which
is highly toxic
and dangerous to the
community. Um
Our communities are
um committed
to working through
the process in New Mexico,
there'll have to be a lot of different
permits. Um
And we want to make sure that
this new
um disposal
cell will be
as up to date
as possible and
that any shipments
going to the red
rock landfill will
also be done as
safely as possible to protect
all the communities along the
way. So we very
much oppose this bill
and hope that you all
will uh
table it in this
Committee. Thank
you.
>> Uh Yeah, my
name is Versa. Nance.
I live Redwater
Pond Road
and I've been
there and
I was born
there
and we all live
there
all the time.
We were just
kids
when this might
started.
We didn't know what it
was and
we were informed
it was
uranium.
No, we
live all through the people
who work,
they build their shed
in their car all
this time
when the mine was
open.
So
no,
Mr. Mino, you're
opposed to
get that Tayle
mov'e.
It's a nice
eyesore
living between those
male. Um
You ruin your
mind
in the backyard, front
yard.
How would you like to live like
that? We
don't, we didn't
ask for
it.
So now
we want that turned
up to
take away from
our
community
and I know other
reservation and
throughout the reservation,
there's other minds
about 500
something
and people that live
near those of
mining,
they have all kinds
of
ailment.
They have
physical
damage to
their
system,
cancer and
whatnot.
And even there's some
ladies that were pregnant
that had a
deformed
babies.
So,
so we want this
mind to be
moved from our
place, the
tailing
every year, we put out
a walk
to inform
others to
look up
for community,
for our Children,
for the future of our
Children.
So please
help us
could get
this out of
our way.
I know you people
that live on
by the,
you don't
care.
But for us,
we lose
family
load of people have
gone
because they work at the
mines
and we have the
walks every summer.
We have people from all
over China
Africa
and they complain too
about their.
But like, so
the, the community
like that,
think about you're human
being. We're
just like you,
we want to live
where it's
safe.
So please,
I oppose
it.
The bill
that you put out there
and we have invited you
to our work
and the city
government.
So we don't
see many of
you come to our place
to see the
place.
So that's
what I'm gonna say and thank
you for your
attention.
>> Thank you madam Chair. Thank you
Senators. My name is
Sarah Canno and I work for
Amigos Bravos as a policy
specialist, Amigos
Bravos is a statewide water
quality protection and
restoration organization
based in Taos, New
Mexico, guided
by social justice
principles and dedicated
to preserving and restoring
the ecological and cultural
Integrity of New Mexico's
water and the communities
that depend on it. I've
been on the walks that MS
Nez was just referring to
and I'm here to urge you
to oppose
Senate Bill
316.
We uh our organization
is particularly concerned on
impacts on ground and surface
water quality and it's so
important for us to
come together and find
solutions to this
uh URA these uranium
mine um waste
piles as
they'll impact water for the
whole State. And what we
saw in um
the original uh
disaster in
1979
in the Rio Puerco is that these
areas didn't get any attention.
We know it was the largest
spill of uranium
waste in us history
and it didn't get the attention
that other spills got because of
where it occurred. So,
um we think this is
important for
the Redwater Pond
uh road community that
works so hard with the
EPA, with
Navajo Nation, with New
Mexico Environment Department.
This has been a decades long
process and finally, we have an
agreement on it, but
also it's important for the whole
State because we need to show
that there, we can come together
with the proper agencies and
find solutions to these
problems. Um
So thank you for your
time.
>> Thank you. My name is Colin Cox with
the Center for Biological Diversity. I'll just
be very brief. Um We
oppose 316 because
it'll stop uranium waste to clean up
in the State. And we just
urge you to, I don't, I don't
want to repeat what other one has said
and all the things you've heard within the community.
We just urge you to table 316
and let the cleanup continue.
Thank
you.
>> We will mov'e to those
on zoom
too.
Good morning, madam,
Chair Members of the Committee. Um Am
I audible to you?
>> Yes, we can hear you, please State your
name. >> Great. Thank you
very much. Uh
madam Chair Members of the Committee.
My name is Eric
Janz. Uh I'm the legal
director at the New Mexico
Environmental Law Center.
The New Mexico Environmental
Law Center opposes
Senate Bill 316 and ask
that the Committee table it
um for
three reasons. Uh Before I
get into the reasons, I'd like
to uh
acknowledge the
uh community Members
who uh made
the trip to Santa Fe
this morning. Um
All these folks who I know
well, ha have
jobs and families
and they've taken
time from their lives
to stand
up for their community. And uh so
I commend them for that.
Um The three reasons
that the Law Center poses
this uh
bill
is that first, it's
unclear uh what kind
of waste uh
this uh
bill applies
to, does it apply to mine waste
to tailings to high
level nuclear waste? These
are all very different kinds of
waste with very different kinds
of uh radioactive
and chemical properties. The
mine waste that is scheduled
to be moved from the
quave uh old
quave mine site to
the Red Rock landfill
property. Six miles
east of Theo
is mine waste.
It's a fairly low
level uh of
radiation. Uh
It has no
risk or very low
risk and acute
exposures.
But chronic exposures like
the folks at the Redwater Pond
road community experience
uh can be very
dangerous.
Um
Secondly,
the
uh the bill
uh and with all due
respect, it's
misinformed.
Um The Red Lock Red Rock
landfill is not in Thu at
six miles east of
theu. Well, the cuve
mine, as you've heard uh mine
way. So as you heard is
uh mere yards from
where people live.
Um Red Rock
landfill has uh one
residence within two
miles uh a
two mile radius.
Um Additionally,
the uh technology
and engineering
uh at the Red rock
landfill as
planned by EPA
uh is going to be State
of the art. It'll be a, a line
disposal cell
with leak detection
uh and an apport
transpiration cover
uh that is
much more uh
safe in terms of public
health and environmental
protection than simply
uh burying the waste
uh with dirt
where it uh currently
lies, which is the only other
alternative uh
which brings me to the third
point. Uh And
that is that this bill as
written uh will
effectively halt
mine remediation,
responsible mine remediate
uranium mine remediation
in New Mexico.
Um without there's
no current federal
facility that takes
uranium mine waste, none
is planned.
Um And
so the only option
for communities is to have
the mine waste in their
communities covered
with dirt uh
and left to
erode as time goes
by. So, uh
this bill is essentially
sentencing uh communities
like Redwater Pond road,
Mariano Lakes, Smith Lakes
and dozens of others
to be living with uranium
mine waste uh
for generations to
come. Thank
you.
And next >> we
have
good morning madam
Chair and Committee Members.
My name is Aa
Chavez. I'm the Ed
for nm native vote.
We are in deep opposition
to SB 316.
There was no tribal consultation
or community outreach.
Our communities are not
landfills. What about
the underground water plume?
Does it mov'e along the Rio
PCO? Where is the monitoring
of toxins? We
need to stop the environmental
racism. We need to be
cleaning up our lands
for these reasons and
others that have been stated, we
strongly urge the Chair and
the Members to please
table and or kill this bill.
Thank
you.
We will >> mov'e >> to >> Committee Members,
Senator Souls
Madam Chair. I I do want
to respond to some of those before
we start. And then I do have Man
Monique from the Navajo Nation
who runs the natural Resources
Unit.
When we talk about Redwater
pond. I if that
contamination doesn't have a
uranium in it, why are
they lining the, why are they
the way they burying it and lining
it? Because that is
raining a minute.
We want the the tailings
moved but do we want to
mov'e from one reservation
location to another and burden
the next chapter which
the the chapter is?
And for the Gentleman that just
talked, I mean, you can talk about
where through is and where
through isn't. But my wife grew up
in through. So I
know exactly where the power
plant in the in the dump
is. Uh but we
always have
other people with
outside influence saying, oh, we
don't want it here, we don't want it there.
If the late lady from
Taos would read the
fir it
says that depending on the bill's
definition, underground monitoring,
potential impacts to
groundwater quality
becomes more significant
when we mov'e these tailings like
that. And so we have
shallow water and
through
which would
greatly affect the
groundwater quality.
I agree. I mean, we didn't
create this problem but now we have to
deal with it and how do we
mov'e it? How do we mov'e it
safely? Well, in
Utah, a company
called Yes Energy Fuels
has agreed to set 10,000
tons of uranium waste from abandoned
uranium mines on the
Navajo nation for
free.
They've even accept, agreed
to accept an additional
30,000 tons
of uranium waste for
free.
And so can it be transported
to other places? Yes, it can,
can be transported
from one chapter
house to another.
There's no fairness in that
and, and people need to have a
voice. The council delegates
when I met with him are all
in support of this bill. I don't
know why they're not here. We didn't
notify him of that, but
we're, we're just moving
one problem to another
problem place.
And if it's not that
toxic, then why are we
moving it at all?
It's toxic
and, and we're moving it to a dump
site that has shallow
water that's closer to
another chapter. Uh
He to that May be the
Baka Pruitt chapter and
not the root chapter
and we're moving it from one chapter
place to another.
And are we really protecting what we
nearly need to protect as we mov'e
forward? Um But we, I
love to hear people that
aren't from the reservation
talk about what the
needs of the reservation are and how
they're experts. And they walked on this
walk and they walked on that walk.
They've never had a wife teach at a
church rock chapter school
and watch what
some of the effects are on Children
of uranium mining.
They've never had to deal with
other people. They, they come and they
go, they get federal grants,
they try to tell us what's best
for for us.
Um But it doesn't need to be
removed and where does it need
to be moved? It needs to be moved to a
safer place. I mean, here's
a place in Utah that will take it for
free
when we're gonna have to build another
uranium waste dump
site in New Mexico. I represent
Milan and, and you look
at those sites and you can just see
piles of tailings
and, and large sprinklers
running every single day
if something happens, a flood
happened, uh maybe a
year or two ago and they
had to barricade a bunch of stuff.
So the tailings wouldn't hit the,
the, the water streams
and, and go down the river. So
there's the best place for it
underground. I believe so madam
Chair and I believe that
uh I'll let my expert witness
make a comment before we
get started.
>> Thank you so much, Senator
Munoz and thank you for
your support and putting this bill
together.
The Naville Nation has
523
miles.
I'm
sorry, I'm Daniel
Moquin. I'm
with the Naval Nation, Department of
Justice, the Natural
Resources Unit. Um
Sorry that it was late for this meeting.
I just learned about it early
this morning and I live in Los Luis
and I had to drive up
and uh
had barely enough time to
make it. Um
But, but thank you very much
Senators for having me here
from this Committee for
being here.
What the Neville Nation is trying to
do is
use a new technology
that we think is very
exciting and
not only do we think it's very
exciting, the NRC
thinks it's very
exciting. They
actually uh clarified
their regulations. So, so this
new technology could, can mov'e
forward. It was a four to nothing
decision
because the technology
was so promising. We think
the technology is promising
not only for the NAVI nation,
but we think that could end up
saving a State
in New Mexico, hundreds of millions of
dollars in remediation
cost
two.
Now, we care very
much about the
Redwater Pond community.
I've, I've been there
numerous times. Uh
They, they're
not as, as uh
supportive of the
ablation technology, they want
the stuff
removed.
But
President Nyren, when he first
supported, it wasn't
uh uh
wasn't totally
informed about the situation
because President Nyren
wants to be moved
materials to be
moved as quickly
as possible.
Uh
Proposed repository
does not have a water
discharge permit. It doesn't
have a license.
It's, it May go
2 to 4 years of, of
hearing even
before there's approval to
start building, it
May be six years before
there's any
remediation done
under that proposal.
Now, Senator Munoz was, was
very uh
of helpful
in in drafting this in such a
way that uh
we don't kill
the U SEPA proposal
because what the U SEPA
said is
basically put a gun to the nation's
head. And
if they can't do,
if you can't do the Red rock
repository, then they say they're
just gonna do a cap in place
which everybody in this room
agrees is the worst thing that could
occur to leave that
material at the Redwater
pond.
We believe we have a technology
where we can start removing
and, and while the 10,000
tons is a very small
fraction, it would
allow us to do a, a
test at
that scale of this
technology, 10 tons
per hour removing
uh uh
removing materials. And
we could do that in a
matter of a month, we could
start moving material
off the site within a
month and not have the
uncertainty of creating
a repository.
This ablation technology
was tested by us
CPA
and,
and basically, their results
were showing that it could
take like
98% of the uranium
out of the soil that's in the soil
and the material and
93% of the radium
226.
Um
and the by-product
itself can be sold to energy
fuels. I mean, energy fuels
is, is a
uh entity that's
a private energy. It's a
business, it wants to make money, the
reason it wants to do the 10,000
tons. It actually wants to show that it
can reprocess this
material, get
uranium uh
from it and
basically put that in the,
the nuclear cycle.
But things
changed of
tremendously in the world when
cop 28 and that's the
conference dealing with
global warming decided
that nuclear power was the
only way we're ever gonna make
the, the targets
to prevent global warming.
They said they're gonna triple
triple uh the use
of nuclear power
in the world. Well, that
takes uranium,
navigation is
dealing
and myself simultaneously
dealing with pinon plane
and reopening of uranium
mines and there May be
uranium mines reopened
all, all through New
Mexico.
What we did with this
is to avoid us
CPA. Just saying, well,
the, the,
with the Legislation with,
with the help Senator
Mules in his office
is just
say
you need telling you
us CPA, you need to test
this at scale. So we
can see whether it's technology
works or
fails be
before you implement
the alternative. But
since the alternative can't be
implemented until there's a
license, there's
going to be no delay caused
by, by this particular
bill because it's,
it's four, it's a minimum
of probably four years out before
you even have the licensing
permit permitting in
place.
So
what, so
we don't see how this
delays. We've
also, the bill is also
drafted. So it doesn't give
the US CPA the permission to
just say, ok, throw, throw
in the towel and say, OK,
we're just doing, gonna do cap in
place. NAVI
nation deliberately
uh helped draft
drafted. So it would
not lead
to that alternative
automatically.
And all U SEPA is to
test of that scale. I will
say further that the
Naville Nation just
recently has decided,
you know, this is so
promising, even though
Naval Nation has limited money,
we're actually gonna test to that
scale. We're going to do
it within the next few months.
We're going to bring
uh the existing machines
because this company
called DSA Separate
from energy fuels. But they
have this inflation
technology
and we're going to pay
uh to have
it to do the
ablation. We're gonna bring the
minerals up to, to energy fuels
and sell them to them.
And then we're gonna take uh
what happens? You get a 25%
fraction and a 75%
fraction. You
concentrate all the uranium
uh vanadium
and probably critical minerals
which also were important to this
country. Um
You know, we, we've made this
argument, the U SEPA
and all they, they want
to stay within their style and they go, well,
we don't know how to
monetize
waste even
though uh on,
on the, we
believe like on the
cora it would cost
31 to $38
million to do the
ablation and the
ablation can be done in a matter of
months. Take it
out of, take
the uranium out and we'd create
the 25 and 75%
fraction. Some of it would go
immediately. And
we believe that while it costs 31
to $38 million to the
ablation that you probably get
40 to $50 million of
uranium. And we
don't, uranium and vanadium,
we don't know about critical minerals at
this point. We don't know if they're.
So that's the study we want to
do. Now,
after we have the, the 25%
75% fraction,
the 25% fraction because
that's highly radioactive.
We'd want to ship that out
immediately. So it
would start within months,
moving it from Redwater
pond.
Um The
75%.
Now, it's interesting because
that soil
under naval nation
standards and
us CPA standards us
CPA standards.
That's, that's a remediation. You
wouldn't have to do more
uh for like
grazing. Uh
So this is true
on uh New Mexico
lands. Well,
at least the BLM lands because
what the NRC has said is anything
on federal lands you're taking on
federal
lands?
Uh, uh, it
would be possible. I'm
sorry, probably took too much
time. But this is rather complicated.
But the, the, the
basic point is we want to start
remediation immediately.
That's what, that's what the naval nation
wants to do. And we think this
bill by helping to
push the U SEPA
into using it. And plus we're gonna
spend our own money to,
to, to do a test
uh for
test that, that
uh there will be a test
of uh
of the
ablation technology.
So that, and
if you look at the bill is, once
there's a test of the ablation technology
and we think it can be done in a few
months, then then it can
mov'e forward, everything can
mov'e forward. The bill doesn't
prohibit, prohibit
anything once that, that
ablation test is, is
done and
we're, we're ready to mov'e in
months.
I'll, I'll conclude there. I, I guess
I've taken too much time already. Thank
you,
Senator >> Souls.
Thank you madam Chair.
There. A whole lot of
comments and things
about ablation and about
reprocessing. Where
is that in this
bill?
>> That that is not on this
bill? That's why it
allows it. So you don't see
it in there.
>> Ok. Uh Madam
Chair. Yeah, we're dealing with what's
in this bill. Uh
Where is the
federally managed underground
depository right
now.
>> Well, there's one currently at
Whipping in, in
Carlsbad and there's
another one in Utah. I don't know the name
of it. >> Uh, madam
Chair and Senator, the
one in whip. Do they take
mind tailings or is it
just transgenic
waste?
>> Um,
I'm not sure that facility,
the other facility know about the only
operating mills
in, in White Mesa
Utah and that's
energy fuels and that's where we're
sending all this material. >> So
madam Chair, you know, the
one down at Whip only takes
trans waste. It doesn't
take mine tailings or any of the
poisons that aren't
radioactive there.
Uh The other one you talked
about or you just
mentioned, uh
does reprocessing,
this only
talks, you know, correct
me if I'm wrong,
but that
it shall only be disposed
of not reprocessed, disposed
of it federally managed
underground depositories.
Where is the underground
depository that's federally
managed? >> That's also up
at White Mesa and that's NRC
licensed and the
NRC. Uh the State
of Utah who,
who basically
is
an agreement State, what they call
agreement State is the ones that, but
they administer it
under the NRC licensing
and basically the requirements
and they're not allowed to deviate
from those requirements unless they have
stricter requirements. So
that, that, that's the repository.
So they would mill it and then they put
it in that repository
>> and, and madam Chair, is
that an underground?
Yes, the repository.
Now, it doesn't talk of it says disposed
of not rebuild,
uh, is what's actually in
this bill.
Um, >> yeah,
it, it would be most
disposed of but they
reprocess it to get
out.
Sorry.
>> And so madam
Chair, Senator
Expert, how
far does that require it to be
shipped?
How far away is
that?
>> Um, I, I should
know that offhand
through the
Chair.
I'm sorry, I
apologize.
>> So, just go madam Chair, Senator,
>> um, Madden Chair,
Senator.
I, I would have to look
at that. I think it's around 200
miles, but I'm, I'm not, I'm
not sure the
exact.
>> So madam Chair and
Senator, uh, what we're talking
about? Mind tailings
is very
heavy
rock dirt,
things of, of
that nature
that are going to be shipped
200 miles.
Who's gonna pay the cost of
that?
>> Um, madam Chair,
Senator,
we, we believe that
uh, partially that, that can
be paid by, by the, the
products that we're going to
be shipping there. So,
but we also think the US
CPA can,
if you look at the, the
US CPA S
numbers,
the cost of disposing
of it at the
proposed uh
facility
was like 100
and, and 30 something million
dollars altogether. The
cost to bring it up,
bring everything up
to White Mason
dispose of it was 100 and
$80 million.
But they, they
used a number of
like $2.5 million
where we have no idea where they got that
in terms of possible,
uh, uh
uranium,
the people. We're talking
to that the experts
in the field. We're saying it's,
it's about about the same
cost as, as
bringing it on up there. So
that, that, that's how we, we think
that that can be accomplished.
We also think because
of that the federal
government, the Department of Defense
and Department of Energy who we have been
talking to desperate
really wants to get their hands on
a, a domestic
source of uranium that we
could get additional federal
funding to, to
defer some of that. So the
naval nation would at least get some of
its uh value for,
for its minerals but
just doesn't exist. Now,
we think that uh you
could, you could cover that
costs,
>> madam Chair and
expert. Lots of what we're
talking about is not actually
uranium waste. These are
mind tailings to get
to the uranium
is the underground that
has high levels of poisons
and other toxins. Not
uranium. Is
this gonna take all of
that waste regardless of
whether it's got a uranium or
only the valuable
uranium uh
tailings that have extra
uranium in it. Will they take
all of the waste because this
bill talks about
all the waste, not just
the valuable waste,
>> madam Chair, Senator.
Yes, it's, it's our,
it's our intent to
take everything
the 25% fraction,
as I said earlier, that's the
valuable waste. We take that
first because it's also highly,
highly radioactive at that
point because you concentrated
all the radioactivity in
there. But we would take
all the material,
all the material of,
of that >> madam Chair and
expert, you just said we're gonna take
that waste first.
My understanding is lots of the
concerns at
Redwater Pond is
not actual uranium
or uh radiation
poisoning. It's all of the
other problems are
they gonna be left with all, all of those
problems until that becomes
valuable? Or is this
company only gonna take the valuable
waste and then go? Oh, well, maybe
we're not gonna take all of it. What
is our guarantee that they're
gonna ship, they can ship
any of the waste up there rather
than just the 25%
valuable >> waste. Madam
Chair
Senator.
What happens to the
75% of
fraction
is
as, as I stated,
all the material is
concentrated. So uranium's
taken out but also
other, other minerals are taking out
at the same time.
And basically
it loses its
leach so that
waste as much and
leach addresses
water infiltration and,
and basically
the ability for that to
mov'e. So
what you're, what you're dealing with is a
much safer fraction.
The entire amount
is much safer because it's
been treated, the
75%
itself is
uh uh
it is, it is,
is clean enough that basically
it would, it would
actually uh
BB the standards where,
where you, you could
have
uh it's better, the
treated the entire treated
material once it's done is is
better than what we
call she sheep camp uh
quality in terms
of uh safety.
So basically you can run sheep
on it. You, you can, you can
have uh sheep
camp on it. It, it
basically what it doesn't
meet and what it did not meet
is the much higher
Navajo nation
residential standard. That's much
higher than the usual U
SEPA residential
standard. And that was
developed because
of native people.
And Naville people in this
particular
have more uh
contact with the land, more
contact with the soil. So
it's a much higher, higher level
of standard. You need a
much higher standard than,
than you would have. So
this, this
technology is already
at a, a,
a standard once it's been treated,
even if you want to remove
the 75% fraction
where you could build a sheep camp on
it. Now, we're not gonna leave it.
We're not gonna leave it, but it,
it, it'll be far safer
than it is right now.
Uh, once, once this treatment
occurs on
it,
>> madam Chair, you know,
I, I,
everything that I'm hearing
is the profits are gonna be taken
out and the problems are gonna be left.
Um, and, you
know, this prohibits the
State from doing any
other kind of uranium tailings
or uranium waste
remediation or anything
else other than this
one particular one in
Utah. And it sounds
like there's a corporate sweetheart
deal set up to get the money
out while leaving the
problems to the people.
Um, I, you
know, as the bills written, I
just don't see
how, you know, that
25% where the profit
is, you know, and then it's like
we'll get to the 75%
but it'll be cleaner for the people.
They'll be ok you know, they've
heard that for
generations
and you know, and this
prohibits the State
from,
from doing any kind of
remediation or other things. So,
thank you, madam
Chair.
Thank you, Senator, >> Senator
Share.
Thank you madam Chair.
So first
I'm very, very
confused because we're
talking about it prevents clean
up.
But then
you who represent the Navajo
nation anyway, or at least
a uh say no,
it's gonna clean up much
faster.
So I don't
know who to ask. But how does
it prevent clean
up if we're
gonna clean it up in
months instead of
years,
>> madam Chair? So
thank you for the question. I
mean, I'm as perplexed
as you are because it's
our intent to, to speed
up, speed up the clean
up. It's our
intent to, to
have it as protective
as possible
immediately. It's, it's
our intent of naval nation
not to divide its
communities.
And it's your
intent of not to
have the
material uh
at through where it's, it's close
enough to endanger the naval nation.
And, and the Navel Nation has one
other concern that I will share with
you that once,
once this facility opens,
we have no ability to
prevent uh
waste from being brought.
Uh not only throughout New
Mexico but from Arizona and
everywhere else. We don't want
a regional repository for
waste
on, on the border of Naville
Nation and it's,
it's not even, it's on the
border because the original
place that U Sepa S
said, and at the
last minute they said, well, we can mov'e
it, but they never shown us how
it's over. The mineral State
of the Naville Nation
mine. Naville Nation owns
the mineral State over where they're going
to build this repository.
The Naville Nation and a lot
Navajo lattes own it.
So they're going to take,
uh, illegally
take, by the way, our
mineral State,
if they build this repository
in the present present place,
it is now.
>> So I've also
madam Chair, I heard
what at least to me sounded
like conflicting information.
One was that we have all
these this toxic
waste there that we need to deal
with. And then the
other one is what we have is
crushed rock that's
ugly.
Is it both or is it
just toxic or is it just
crushed rock? That's
ugly.
>> It man. Chair
Senator,
it is toxic,
particularly untreated,
you know, radioactivity
levels are high enough to
be toxic. There are other
minerals there that
also would come out if we did
the ablation. So, so it
it is toxic. There's no
question is toxic in
place and
because there will be no treatment
of it under, under the
existing U SEPA,
it will be toxic when it
reaches the through
landfill and it will stay
toxic forever
because there there will
be no treatment
and that's what we're trying to
do because when
you're dealing with elements like
uranium 238 that have
a half life of 4.5 billion
years facility
built for 50 to 100 years is
just kicking the can down the road.
We want treatment. That's
what the nomination wants and they
don't want that adjacent
to our communities. We don't want that
dump and we don't want other
waste brought there,
uh potentially bought,
brought there particularly
when there's a, a
win win here
where
the United States gets the
uranium it wants and gets
the materials and we get rid
of it forever. And
that's, that's what the nomination
wants.
>> So madam
Chair, I know there
was some discussion about,
uh, shipping
it versus
leaving it
isn't shipping
dangerous
>> we believe.
Oh, sorry,
I'll get this right. Eventually. I do
apologize, madam
Chair
Senator.
Um,
there's, there's minimal
risk, uh shipping.
I mean, anytime you have a truck on the
road there, there's always
a potential for accident.
Uh But you know,
the, they're going
to ship it, they're gonna ship
it from, from the red water
water water water
pond community down to
through. So it, it's
not like
obviously you
have, you, you're,
you're probably going to have eight
times. Uh I think it's about
eight times the distance, but
you're still shipping. I mean, you, you're
still shipping and there's still
that risk of
no matter how you're shipping.
But, but we think
that,
uh
and it goes back to what I said
earlier, we're either going
to mine new uranium
in this country or
we're going to be
going back and we think
is a better alternative,
reprocessing
the waste that are at a at, at
these mines. It's
my analogy. It's like aluminum
can, you, you can save
95 percent of the energy by
recycling an aluminum
can as opposed
to going and
dau site going all through
that process and creating
it. It's just far
safer, far better for
the environment that we use
the opportunity
to not create new
minds. And there'ss
uh you know,
naval nation is preventing
numerous companies
trying, trying to come in and push us
into the new mines.
But we, we can't prevent
mines around Mount Taylor and
other areas
if they open new mines.
So we,
and, and they'll be shipping ore,
they'll be shipping ore. And
ironically, the Mount Taylor mine
will be shipping ore all the way up
to White Mesa.
You know, and they
want to put a huge mine in White
Masa, 52 trucks per
day type mine
at, at Mount Taylor.
We think it's far better
that uh,
it's not be shipped from
there if, if
it isn't necessary. But, but
ship shipped from Aura, you said
that and unlike
that one, which would be 10 to
12 years down the road,
the country needs the uranium. Now,
we can provide it now because we can
provide the waste now. And that's
what we're trying to
do.
>> So madam Chair, as I
was just listening and trying to sort
this out and I just couldn't understand
why there was
opposition
to faster clean
up and better clean up
because
that's what it sounds like to
me.
Um
Yes, I
don't disagree
that,
that there's the potential
of,
of taking the part
you want leave another
part.
Um
But then I think I figured it
out.
The Redwater pond
folks that are
here,
they have legitimate concerns
because they've been
ignored for
how many years 5070
years, 80
years, I don't know, long
time since
those
first uranium mines were started
there.
But then I looked at the other people that
were,
I believe that it's simply a
hatred of nuclear
power because
there are too many people in the world that they
can't tell the difference between nuclear
power and a
bomb,
which is significantly different
technology.
And so it's just hatred of
nuclear power that's driving this.
And I think they've scared the people in
Red Redwater
Pond
and, and that's what concerns
me is
if it's just
hatred
of nuclear power
because we hear folks all the time. Oh,
we have to have clean energy but not
nuke.
Ok. Nuke
is zero, carbon
zero
and you can start one of those plants that run
for
long
decades,
decades.
Uh The danger of,
of nuclear power.
We have American sailors
that sleep right next to nuclear
reactors on aircraft carriers
and submarines and none
of them come off the submarine with three
heads. None
of them
because we know how to deal with the
nuclear
power.
Say, well, what about Chernobyl?
Ok. Chernobyl was
bad but
Chernobyl was bad because Russians
are stupid. They
turned off,
they literally turned
off the
safeties,
they turn them
off.
Now, first of all,
they didn't build a good power plant
to begin with.
Oh, but what about Three Mile
Island? Ok. Let's see how many
people died at Three Mile Island.
None.
How many people got sick
three because they fell
over, getting out of the place. They didn't get
sick. They were injured
because they tripped, getting out of
it.
Nobody was injured at Three Mile
Island made a big deal.
It caused, it
caused
as a former soldier, I cannot
say her name
properly
because there's expletives
stuck in the middle of her name according
to, according
to my commanders,
but it caused her to
make a movie
talking about
melting all the way through the
core of the earth,
which again is not
possible, but
it's certainly not possible in
American
reactors.
And now, and now I understand
it, the people
from, from uh
Redwater Pond Road,
they're legitimately
concerned because,
because they've been lied to for a long
time,
the other people are concerned because
they can't get nuclear power
and nuclear bomb
separated in their
mind.
And I think that's a shame madam
Chair because
we have a chance to do some really
good things here,
really good
things,
hatred of oil, gas and
coal,
all of which can also and
have been dramatically cleaned
up over
decades.
Nuclear power is
only expensive because
the power plants get sued
every 30 minutes by somebody
that hates nuclear power and
doesn't understand the science behind
it.
That's why it's expensive,
stop suing them and it would
be cheap.
They're not that hard to build
either.
And as long as we don't let the Russians
run one of them, we won't have a
problem.
So madam Chair, I think
that I think I figured out why
there's opposition because I just, it
didn't make any sense to me as I'm
listening made no
sense. We're gonna clean
it up faster and
better.
Are there still concerns?
Absolutely because
we've been lying to him for
70
years,
but he represents Navajo Nation.
I do have a question, madam
Chair. Why,
why aren't there delegates
here? Why isn't the President
here, >> Mr. President?
I don't think I sent out the alert from
delegates to be online but the
delegates and
uh Mr. Monique,
we're in consultation in, in
with this bill
and they had no changes
when we originally drafted it. They thought
it was fine. This doesn't
stop the redwater pond
cleanup. Just
remember you're gonna hear four years
before they even get a water
permit to transfer
that this doesn't
stop the redwater pond. Somebody
has sold these people build goods.
It's not true.
Does not stop, it does
not prohibit it in any way
shape or form. Just
says when, when the millions are
done that they're not going to be
deposited in another place.
You've heard the issues.
They had a tailings break in, in
Milan a year or two
ago and, and they had to
stop it. If you keep
putting it above ground,
Mother Nature and the natural
disasters and air quality
are gonna continue to
happen.
And so how do you really fix
a problem? This
doesn't limit anybody's
ability to, to clean up
anything. It just says when they're done,
these need to go underground.
I mean, when are we gonna learn in New
Mexico at some
point in time time?
I'm not, not be here. You guys
May not be here, but something's
gonna happen in Carl's bed
like it happened a couple of years
ago where they had a nuclear
waste leak, right.
And, and when are we gonna learn that? Are
we really want New Mexico to
continue to be the dumping
ground? I, I agree
100%. When they did the
uranium mines, it was boom and
bust and they made their money and they
got out and they left
us with this problem. They
left damaging to
people. They
heard
generations of Navajo
people by leaving these
and, and now we're left to deal with
it. And how do we deal with it best?
Right. I'm,
I'm the determination the Nava
Nation is. This is the best
way to begin to deal with it.
It's not my determination.
It's let's not just dump
it in another chapter. And another
problem uh where they're not
gonna see it where
they're gonna see it off the
road. It's going to be next to the beautiful
red rocks of New Mexico.
And we have one solid
waste dump site that the Navajo
Nation uses
mckinley and Sebola uses.
Anything happens and you shut down
the dump site, then you don't have any
dumps the
Navajo waste, Navajo nation's
trash or garbage goes
to from there
to the east of
Thu or what do you want to call
it? Prut Baca? And,
and it's all the dumped there. But
this is not a force. This is
not saying you can't clean up
that stuff. This is
saying, where do we want
to head in our future with uranium
waste? I
mean, where do we really want to
hit?
You won't put it next to the river
in San Juan? Nobody wants it in their
backyard,
>> right? >> So where do we
put it where it's the safest place and
that's underground?
>> So madam Chair, I
think,
I think that, that
especially in New Mexico, we
seem to have a fear of
technology. We
had a chance to do carbon capture
and we decided, no,
we didn't want to do it because we were
afraid we
have a chance to do
uh a lot of
things. And in New Mexico we say
no, we don't want to do it because we're
afraid
and I don't know why we're
afraid.
I don't think New Mexicans used to be
afraid.
I think we became afraid when
Californians came in here and told us
to be
afraid.
I don't know, I don't know this
technology. I don't know why
Mesa,
I would like to know more about White
Mason
and I do think that that would
have helped
us if we had some of
that.
But I do think if, if
this is going to actually clean it
up for real
and not just mov'e
it,
that's good if it's
gonna produce
uh the power
that we need, especially
because we have this mandate
for 43%
electric vehicles. We've got these
data centers that, that
suck power in
unbelievable
amounts and we're
closing our coal fired power
plants
and the, the, the wind turbines
and the solar panels can't keep
up with that stuff. They
just, you, you have to
have literally
tens of thousands
of acres of wind turbines
to replace San Juan generating
station, tens of
thousands of versus 20
acres.
And then you have to run all the transmission
lines that takes a lot
of time.
Nuclear power seems
like a logical answer to
me. But
that's because I know the difference
between power plant a
bomb.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Senator Chair, >> Senator
Maestas. Thank you, madam,
Chair, Senator Munoz. Thank
you,
appreciate you emphasizing
the point that
where this stuff is stored
matters, you know, where
this stuff is stored matters.
And so when I read
the bill, it's like
it,
you know, that the feds probably
have super strict
regulations that it should be
stored where in
a federal facility.
But now I'm learning
that that there May not be
a
facility uh ready
made is the facility in Utah.
Uh
madam Chair, Senator Munoz is the
facility in Utah. Does it fit
the definition under under the
bill
where it
says
federally managed
underground
repository?
>> We May want to tweak that
definition a little bit. But
like I said, it's, it's, it's, it's
managed,
I think we need to find,
manage a little bit better. II
I will concede that.
But the, the facility up at
Energy Fuels
basically, as I
said, is NRC
licensed and then basically,
uh that's
the oversight is NRC.
You know, I think,
you know, that's, that's the
intent and
I certainly wanted
to mind it
being tweaked.
I also like to clear
up one
statement
and I think it's a misconception
of that.
Um, where they said,
well, how are we sure
that 75% is going
to go because it's not
energy, energy fuels
is willing to take
all the waste. There's,
it's just a question of
payment and, and we
are arranging the payment. I
mean, uh if
you look at uh
uh US E
PS own figures to
bring to the
feet of dispose of it up,
up at the West West
Mesa uh
facility of
energy fuels facility.
They're going to pay them,
they would have to pay them
100 and 5 million
to do it at the through.
They want 100 and $10
million you know.
So, so it's
by, by, by moving money
around. I mean,
now I understand
Redwater Pond being
concerned, but we're
not relying on, on the
private entities to
take it. Uh
The promise that's being made is
being made by the NAVI nation,
the President of the Naville Nation
that all the material is going to be
moved, you know. So,
so that, so it
will be moved.
>> Oh, thank you madam Chair. Thank you
Gentlemen. I,
I think um
just going through
just thinking out loud.
I don't know if New Mexico can permit
something that happens in Utah.
Maybe Utah can.
But my question is,
does this bill need to be passed
for, for you to
do what you're talking about? I
mean, I think, um,
I think that it's probably
more advantageous to take it to the
facility in Utah. If there's
a, if there's a profit
being made, that's not my concern. My
concern is just the, the environmental
impact of removing that,
that waste and putting it in a safe
storage. Um
So we shouldn't be prejudiced with
regards to any of that.
Um
But when you say uh what
is real quick, madam Chair,
Gentlemen, what is Nr
>> C
NRC is the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission?
>> Thank you. And then also when you say
they would
remi they would
deposit it.
Our intent is to take all
the material. Who is they, who
is, who is, who is
our >> OK.
Our is the Naville Nation,
Naval Nation, Epa and
President Nyren, we've
personally talked to him.
So, so our intent is
to remove all
waste but not
divide Navajo
communities and not expose
Navajo communities to, to more
waste. >> So madam
Chair, I appreciate we should
uh find a way for
State government to work
with the Navajo Nation. The key is
just to remove the waste as soon as
possible. Uh
But to mov'e it from
one community to another,
it is probably not the best thing to
do. Um But
anyway,
madam Chair Senator, you want to respond
to that. I I >> I think the EPA
has to give you permission to mov'e the
acre waste and then they have to do
that. And so until they
decide that you can mov'e it and where
they're gonna mov'e it because it's got to go
somewhere um just
like in the, in from
red water pond to, to
Pruitt Baca through whatever you
want to call it,
they're just moving it from one place
to another and, and they got to make the
approval and they've agreed to
that uh removal
and to pay the cost. I mean, we
haven't, there's other
mines, Mariano church
rock. All those
mines have millions, but those
are going to
uh a site in Milan
where they already have an EPA site
in clearance and
they're going to put the tailings there
and they May change their mind with this new
technology though.
>> Madam Chair, thank you Senator Munoz for that
clarification. And then also,
um
because uranium is used
in nuclear power
reactors and stuff like that, it's, it's under the
auspices of
NRC.
>> Madam. Chair,
Senator.
Um the NRC
has regulatory authority
about anything that occurs
from milling on,
milling on mining
is actually not regulated
by the NRC.
And, and, and so so some of this
waste as
it sits there, the NRC doesn't
have regulatory authority,
but you know, once you mov'e
it, start moving it to the mill, the, the
NRC would have regulatory authority.
>> Thank you, sir, madam Chair, Senator
Munoz. Lastly, the, um, the
mineral waste that's proposed
to be moved, that the Navajo
Nation has mineral rights to
that, to that
waste.
>> Oh,
>> since the, since the, assuming
the miners have moved on the >> mining
company, madam Chair
of it,
we, we believe we do
and, you know, obviously,
if we don't, there, there are
ways around it because we could
tax any
removable, you know, we,
we could create a taxation scheme.
We, we think that we can
talk to the
the the potential
responsible parties
and basically work out a deal with
them where we wouldn't have
any litigation problems.
But if we do then
then, you know, you
know, it is naval
nation resources and
we, we, we do believe that
that, you know, it's coming
off our lands that, that we do
have a right to, to, to, to
that material. >> No, thank you madam
Chair. So I appreciate
your leadership center on this issue
is trying to, trying to do the best
for all, all involved.
I don't think the bill
solidifies exactly what you
want to accomplish. So I May
not be able to support it, but I just
want to thank you for bringing it
forward
>> the questions from Committee
Members. The Chair will
entertain motion.
I mov'e to table. We
have a motion to table
that's non debatable.
Anita, please call the
roll
>> the vote for Senate

Committee meeting. Thank
you,
>> Chair Members of the Committee. Thank
>> you. Thank you madam
Chair
