I mentioned in my opening is

after I turned to the section
one fourteen of the election

regarding who can serve on an
election board.
I believe this is in sectional

Mr speaker gentleman it looks
like the that section is an
existing law fund there are
some.

a domestic partnership with one
of the candidates cannot serve

eligible but this expands to

Okay thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady and I think there's some
new language in that section
and be a presiding judge within
two years of that election Mr
speaker gentle lady my reading
that correctly.
Mr speaker gentleman that's
correct.
changing any kind of per diem or
arm of.
What we're paying these

speaker gentle lady what I need
to be in compliance with that
Mr speaker gentleman we believe
those are subject to it for a

Okay Mister speaker gentle lady
those could be deleted I believe
the ballots is about.
Twenty months or something like
that Mr speaker gentle lady with
those also be deleted alongside

the election those are available
for twenty two months this bill
provides for other elections
without a federal candidates for
files for longer than sixty days
I think that's a good thing to
do Mr speaker gentle lady I'm
gonna go about section twenty
I think it's twenty six in your
mail that envelopes Mr speaker
gentle lady and from my
understanding Mr speaker gentle
lady we are asking for the last
four digits of the voter's
social security number which
voter registry to ensure that
those social security's match
and then my second question on
that Mr speaker gentle lady is
if they do not match how would
part one is yes part two is that
would go to the care process.
Okay Mister speaker gentle lady
and then regarding the cure
process we are extending that to
toward go to Mr speaker Mr
speaker gentleman yes that would
be done as we did in twenty
twenty two the Friday after the
election would be the deadline.
Okay thank you Mr speaker gentle
Okay thank you Mr speaker and
gentle lady yeah I would just be
interested in seeing how many of
those ballots were.
Not properly made and the care
security numbers last four Mr
speaker.
Mr speaker and gentleman it's
generally if they're missing the
signature or don't have the last
boxes Mr speaker gentle lady are
they required to pick up those
ballots by the close to poll
time on election day or do they
lady and so let's just say
there's a rural county and they
would have to have someone at
that box in that rural part of
the county by seven PM or
whatever the polls close to pick
up the ballot Mr speaker gentle
bill to page one twenty nine on
the amendment to contact section

Mr speaker gentleman the role of
the county commissioners as the
state but we have
Okay Mister speaker gentle lady
in that report it would pretty
much be the same as what's given
now from the counties or would
there be any other language
making sure the canvas itself is
uniform in every county.
Okay thank you Mr speaker and
gentle lady and then regarding
the ballot box on election night
through the adjournment of the
state campus to ascertain the
missing election returns Mr
speaker gentle lady or is there
any anything that we're changing
closed because sometimes there
are absentee ballots that people
mistakenly
are provisional ballots that
they put in there so they sort
section seventy eight regarding

or insufficiency what we

Okay Mister speaker gentle lady
are we giving the individuals
any longer time to.
Get the signatures or is it just
the review process of those
questions I really appreciate
the answers today thank you Mr

There is further debate the
gentle lady from Bernalillo and
towards Representative Lord
the amendments in contacts I'm
gonna be just ask the question
to level this book up.
she how Tribune now Mr speaker
gentle lady.
Mr speaker lady it she will have
two more weeks.
was in a rhythm here Mr speaker
lady from Torrance virtually all
right now it's fifteen days.
lot of referendums and the clock
always gets run out to on those
and here's the problem you sent
in for the referendum descended
and some boarding or something
as a crack to get kicked back so
clock so can someone look up to
see how long we on our side have
to send the referendum and then
get it back from the secretary
state and the now time to apply
actual review of whether or not
it's sufficient is more thorough
and accurate and it doesn't
have accent of time to get all
the signatures and write it out
just perfectly you Senator the
secretary of state she looks or
to find all your mistakes
reviews it sends it back to you
submit secretary St review sends
it back how long do I have to
reply back to super important as
referendums are super important
Mr speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker and lady from
Bernalillo Torrance this is only
changing the amount of time the
secretary of state has to review
Okay Mister speaker July you're
talking about.
We submit our referendum and
then the secretary states has.
of days I want to make sure that
when we do the referendum and
we're submitting it that this
fifteen days post two weeks
doesn't end up we get it back
that day and that's a cut off
we're just trying to have the
secretary of state gives more
time for thoughtful review of
the referendums there was always
some sort of type of and it came
back there was like fifteen days
and it would be mailed out and I
would get it on the fifteenth
day and then up to six and send
it back so hence my problem with
to my next question so
throughout this I think starting
on page eleven we have some
warning for domestic partnership
however we don't technically
who's that for Mr speaker gentle
lady.
Mr speaker and lady from
Justice there's no spouse of
the Canada allowed on the
election board there's no
domestic partner allowed on that
election board if this is an
acted okay Mister speaker July
Medicaid Hawaii Nevada New
Jersey Oregon Vermont Washington
have domestic partnerships but
we don't have any code like a
forty dash a dash one dash
something for domestic
partnership so so who is
Mr speaker in lady the term
domestic partnership is used
throughout our statues AZ's
spouse and neither is defined.
Mr speaker delayed we don't have
we had a bill and I Taos I
thought we had to Mr I would be
surprised we didn't have
domestic partnership and our
state so I worry about this
building and here when we do not
So going on there's a there's a
section in here Pacific section
ninety eight but that may have
been moved this bill does not
eliminate the pre primary
convention but it does repeal
end up at the top of the ticket
so did we just literally repeal
that is that what just happened
in that section Mr speaker
gentle lady.
Mr speaker lady for a valid
order now in every election
problem I have mostly is we have
the referendum thing scares me
because having done referendums
and having kicked back so many
times and it literally right
to go to how do we define that
and and it's excluding certain
people that want to master
partnerships people who want to
benefit a meritorious but don't
want to do marriage which would
was going to ask so I with that
I I finish my questions thank
you.
