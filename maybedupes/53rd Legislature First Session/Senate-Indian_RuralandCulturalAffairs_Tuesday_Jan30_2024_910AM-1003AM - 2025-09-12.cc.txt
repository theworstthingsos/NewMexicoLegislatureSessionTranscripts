Explain your build.
I wasn't
everything up till now was just
kind of smart alec comments and
now you're making put out the
whole world that i'm making
smart alkan thank you very much
it's all
mrperiod chair this is really
about the
semi constantanial of the
declaration of independence yes
exactly two hundred and fiftieth
year anniversary
semi quinn centennial.
But neither one of us were well
enough educated to say.
So this
for what.
No
one else six
so mister chair.
This is really about the
declaration of independent and
the four hundred and fiftieth
year are of its signing so
signed in seventeen seventy six
right and so here is here is the
the declaration I just want to
read just a little bit of it
here so
when in the course of human
events it becomes necessary for
one people to disolve the
political bands which have
connected them with another and
to assume among the powers of
the earth the separate and equal
station to the laws of nature
and nature's god entitled them a
decent respect to the opinions
of mankind requires that they
shall declare the causes which
impell them to the separation
most of us have heard that
probably at many times but the
last sentence says this.
The.
And for the support of this
declaration.
With the firm reliance on the
protection of divine providence
we mutually pledge.
To each other or lives are
fortunes and our sacred honor
so the question had.
Is who were this who are these
men that sign us fifty six of
us.
Five signers were captured by
the british as traders.
And tortured and killed.
Twelve had their homes ransacked
and burned two lost funds in the
war one had two sons captured
nine of the fifty six with
themselves killed in the war.
What kind of men worthies who
boldly wrote their names on the
declaration.
That let the fires of liberty in
the souls of the whole world.
The twenty four were lawyers and
jurisd eleven were merchants
nine were farmers and large
plantation owners men of means
well educated their security
their incomes in their worldly
possessions made them
substantially well off.
But they signed the declaration
of independence even though they
knew the penalty if they failed.
The.
Was the gallers.
They signed and they pledged
their lives their fortunes in
their sacred owners carter
braced in a virginia a wealthy
planter and trader saw his ships
swept from the sea by the
british navy.
He sold his home in his
properties to pay debt some of
the debts were for them for the
nation itself.
He died in rags.
Thomas can keen it was also
hounded by the enemy and was
forced to move his family almost
constantly.
He served in congress without
pay and his family was kept in
hiding his possessions were
taken from him.
In his reward.
Poverty until his death.
Vandals are soldiers are both.
Looted the properties of claimer
whole walton when it he worked
ruttled middleton.
All lost their properties.
At the battle of your town
thomas nelson junior.
Noted that his own home had been
occupied by general corn wallace
the commander of the briti.
The.
He's looking at his home.
And he tells general washington.
To bomb barred his own home.
The.
He died bankrupt.
France's lewis had his home and
properties destroyed the enemy
jailed his wife and she died
after just a couple of months
john heart was driven from his
wife's bedside as she was dying
their thirteen children fled for
their own lives.
His fields as grissmill were
laid waste.
For more than a year he lived in
the forced and in the caves and
when he returned home.
He found a dead wife.
In all thirteen of his children
missing.
And he died of a broken heart
two weeks later.
Morris and livington suffered
similar fate
and these were the stories of
the sacrifices of the american
revolution these were not wild
eyed rabble rousing roughiens.
These were soft spoken men.
Of means wealth in education.
They had security but they
valued liberty more standing
town straight and unwavering
they pledged.
For the support of this
declaration.
With the firm reliance on the
protection of divine providers
we mutually pledge to each other
or live.
Mister
chair.
This document.
This document.
Started a nation which is not
perfect now and was not perfect
then.
But it lit fires of liberty that
almost no one in all of human
history are in any continent
ever received befo.
Liberty which was unknown
throughout.
Now spread around the world yes
I mean is china does not have
this.
There were plenty of countries
in the middle east do not have
this.
But nobody has.
In fift.
Fortunes.
In their sacred o.
The.
Thank you for chairman.
But then I also.
Sure ever retired.
But I moved to pash.
The.
Oh.
Okay
okay.
Thank you madame I thank you for
that.
Dramatic reading despite.
Two hundred fifty that the.
Finding the united states
america
what are welcoming to the indian
affairs committee.
Sure you're aware of what's
coming to europe
proudly
there I do I do see on the on
the the commission the shirt
that you're creating
here.
About most of the governors
cabinet.
I'm not sure why the absolute
general.
Of the national gardener.
But i'm I am curious that
everybody gets to.
Send a designate other than the
governor.
Who's the utterance here.
And the state destroyed that
makes perfect sense the students
are and would actually show its
but his friend but i'm up but
but i'm wondering if a perhaps
we should have the state
historian either f.
Madame chair.
Having the governor as the
chair.
I believe some important in this
this comes from this is most
other states have this exact
language right now so having the
governors as the chair I think
is is is very important as
having the highest ranking a
person in the state.
Functionally I believe she could
appoint anybody she wants to
actually chair the committee and
I agree that a historian would
be would be great for that and
this does go to the cultural
affairs department that the mo.
Out and it was wondering if the
perhaps.
The.
State australian who shall
convene the meetings.
But not post i'm just thinking
it's we can already do that I
guess it's it's just that a man
charitable service says covers
the one rate chair.
And there's no actual.
I I just hate to think that
that's wh.
Where your nearest amendment.
Should not have asked him that
I can can we do this in the next
between this committee in the
next one well my thought was
just simply i'm pitched to the
line twenty five would be the
state historian.
And then we just add after the
word state historian
who shall convene.
The.
We could either save the
meetings or who shalcom leave
the first bid and then we'd let
the.
But that way we have somebody
whose actual response for it
making sure that people get to
the
which which would you.
Madam chair I don't I don't a I
don't think it's needed but if
we're going to put it in.
I'll convene the first meeting
and then they and then in the
body can elect a chair if they
wish yeah so what we say the
state historian membership might
my memory would be pitched to
one twenty f.
Who shop can be in the first.
I will accept that.
It h two line twenty five after
the word history.
Answered the words who shall
convene.
The first who shall
convene the first meeting.
The governor will be the
honorary chair.
The state his story and w.
Advise them.
It doesn't seem to think it's
necessarily he thinks seems to
think that they will take care
of one third there at the table
so madame chair by convening the
first but by not by not making
the historian the chair can be
the chair but in this case
convene the first meeting then
this group of people who come
from higher red indian affairs
public education lieutenant
governor.
So on can then elect their own.
Or from
in since you were there at the
original signing senator you
could do.
You should do.
Yeah.
But I just want to make sure
they get to the meeting they
have a minute you know where
they wrote the matter when they
wrote the declaration of
independence
somebody had to bring the quilt
that is correction yes.
And that's the.
Convenient means they're the
ones who go by the little many
donuts to get everybody you
know.
Madame charley believe it goes
to finance committee.
Okay.
Mended bills senator.
Senator share you have a.
Thank you so madam chairs long
some sitting here even almost
the end can I do the next one or
you want me to.
Too well wait for senators more
than my estus because that could
be a weight okay senator share
and those that.
Three other bills we have sent
it bill one thirty one senate
bill one seven.
Just ask to be.
Well
he's going to be my expert
witnessing.
We have.
Thank you online we.
Senator my estimates
after that.
Thank you madame churcel said a
bill one eighty nine is an
appropriation to the
department of tourism to just
get the contiment will series on
national television and so just
a little bit history on the
continent world series it's been
around a while but in nineteen
sixty four a group of of a
business owners from farmington
went to chicago where the
american amateur baseball
congress was and still is to see
if they could bring the
contimental serious farmington.
That should have been almost a
futile attempt to do anything
because well farmington in
nineteen sixty four was in the
middle of nowhere and now we're
just right on the edge of
somewhere.
But they won they won the vote
and in it came and why did it
why were they able to do that it
was mostly because of rickets
field.
The field itself.
Was built with local local
people texaco mostly built the
field
not only with their money but
with their their people as well
and this bullfield was as good
as any ball field in america at
the time.
Nineteen sixty four in soul now
you're gonna take these these
are fifteen to seventeen year
old technically.
Of and put them on a major
league barfield.
And looked in play.
And this was huge this was huge.
In just almost unheard of.
The stadium itself would matter.
Wouldn't bleachers.
But the but the field is what
made it happen so as this was
growing as it came along
the the players were coming by
bust for a while but you know
there's no rail nowhere service
and the road to farmington was a
two lane road with no shoulders
most of the w.
Middle of nowhere.
But it's things progressed.
There started beast come some
expenses and so what the city
did.
Is created the foster parent
program and so what happened is
every player.
Got a family.
In that family then housed them
and fed them and washed their
uniforms and took them around to
see the sites and in generally
just took care of them while
they were there which really
raised the bar for all
amateur baseball all around the
world I mean that was that was
huge then the local civics club
the the lions the rotarians of
elk whoever was they started to
adopt the teams and so the team
and general now had somebody to
help them figure out how to
navigate things.
How to how to go places and just
all of that the local community
of banks mostly for first
national bank of farmington for
a long time then wells fargo
bought all of the baseballs
initial voter based.
Playing practicing and things
like that so the communities
done all of this and this is
considered.
The finest amateur baseball
tournament.
Anywhere.
The.
Great baseball.
Of the players that have been
there three hundred and thirty
six.
Have made it to the to the major
leaks.
And that includes them some
serious people that that were in
hall fame that are now in the
hall of them so barry larkin who
was born in cincinnati and
played for cincinnati reds for
his whole career.
Played informing to new mexico.
Edgar martinez who was born in
new york or to recondescent he
played for the mariners after
playing on rickets field.
The most.
Famous one probably is kangaroo
for junior who played for both
cincinnati reds and the mariners
played on rickets field.
And so those are just some of
the highlights that have
happened and with that level of
baseball
we should be.
On tv.
So or as the communities come
together here and said okay so
how do we make this happen cbs
sports literally said okay we
need some advertisers to do this
and because the state of new
mexico is in the business of
advertising the state of new
mexico and this creates
certainly plenty of jobs in
tourism and could create a lot
more tourism.
This is the fund that saw that
weaken have more tourists.
Not quite as dramatic is.
Thank you madame chair
honourable members so in the
first saturday in july the world
descends on william sport
pennsylvania the home of the
little world series
there there's players are twelve
years old eleven twelve years
old.
The connemack world series I
believe has as much or more
marketing potential as the
little world series which has
been on national tv for the
packaging thirty years or so
simply because of the connection
to major league baseball it's
very rare that a kid place in
the little world series and
makes the major leagues.
But there is dozens of connie
mac players who are older
sixteen seventeen who make the
major leagues and so there is
you know about a hundred hundred
and twenty major leaguers who
theoretically could help
advertise cutting mac world
series as a former player.
And and the tourism department
madame chairs you know spends
about eight ten million dollars
in tv advertising a year.
The proview network is the
essentially the espn of new
mexico high school sports never
up a web page and you could
watch picel sports all the long
they have great cameras great
great technology and they film
the connie mac cbs wanted to use
that coverage to to put it on
national tv but was a little bit
short entering of advertising.
The tourism department I believe
spent about thirty five thousand
dollars on the connie mac
through an rfp but if that would
have increased two hundred fifty
thousand would be a national tv.
For the region.
Thank you senator.
Here but those and are in the
audience to have anybody in
opposition.
And.
Okay.
I agree with.
Don't forget which one.
Senator share definitely must
become the reader.
This
is actually a bit for been here
so and it was.
No I think I think I think you
actually write you guys re.
The discussion senator.
His brothers have played in the
continent as we.
It sort of my question manager
is that so are we looking at.
Phone for buying advertisement
or or.
The money that's been
appropriate.
Advertising because I know that
and and FIR is is it's going to
be allows what to do.
The.
Would be comment for.
Madam chaired.
We would buy advertising
advertis.
Okay sorry
I bought it but I can read
because manager baseball and
independence or whatever god
must america
I mean I thought we're trying
to
go.
The only constant in this world
madame chair.
His freedom and baseball okay
okay.
No I actually it's older so they
bay bruth is younger than connie
mac.
Technically it is thirteen to
seventeen I have not seen
anybody that's not at least.
It's quite.
They thank you matter I I had a
better arm than you know
if anyone
know.
But I do or with.
I haven't been there.
We did have a motion senator I
be so for do.
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you committee thank you
manager.
Very reader for the day.
The.
Okay yes so for those online
where on senate build on seventy
the rural libraries and damage.
Yes.
The.
Thank you madame chairman and
thank you members of the
committee I think this is six
annual presentation on the s.
And just to refresh your
memories we we originally.
To assist the fifty libraries
that met the qualifications in
those days that had to be a
small communit.
Some are non pr.
Over the year we we originally
set out to target a fifty
million dollars for the endoment
fund because there were fifty
libraries and the thought was.
In time that would be generating
what amounts to a million dollar
endowment for each library and
the revenue each year is what
they would get and please to say
that this year f.
The payment is going to be made.
Fifteen thousand dollars for
each of these rural areas.
Tell you what they can.
In the meantime a whole bunch of
other communities have been
developing libraries and I grew
up now to.
Approved by the state liberian
who incidentally is here as a as
an expert witness in case
anybody has any questions for
the rural for the state
librarian about how this program
works
and so we need more than fifty
million of each libraries.
The.
We currently have over the years
we've managed to squeeze out.
And we got it up to twenty seven
twenty eight million dollars
now.
Just twenty two short but we're
asking for thirty million to
finish the project because this
is my last year in the senate I
will not be able to come back in
business with you next year if
we don't finish this thing this
year and so the hope is that the
thirty million will provide
enough to cover.
With that i'll ask my.
Crucial use the one who
developed this idea right to me
and I i'm.
The committee thank you so much
for hearing this bill so there
besides the fifty four libraries
that are eligible right now for
the endowment there several more
that'll be coming on line in the
next couple years hills barrel
um daddle oh cyrical the
endowment provided grants for
the first time to five
communities that wanna establish
libraries they were now bay
plablo peaker east weblow timber
own pet coast in a host circle
so they'd add small grants to
three thousand dollars through
the endowment this last year
hopefully this coming year that
will rise a little bit so each
of the libraries will get about
fifteen thousand five hundred
dollars this year it was based
on when the endowment was
fifteen million
it takes a couple years for the
money to catch up you know
through the state investment
council
and for their earnings to build
so
eight sixteen of these libraries
have but it's under sixty
thousand dollars many of them
have budgets in the twenty
thirty thousand dollar range
coach delay could to the prev
low coroner carry socialist
budget is eleven thousand
dollars so fifteen thousand
dollars is going to
more than double their bite
there there currently run by
violent hears so it's going to
make a big impact on these
libraries most of them have told
me they'll be using the money
for a part time staff or to
increase the staff salaries a
question for example lords berg
dow go their library directors
are making fifteen dollars an
hour they world they will be
able to get a raise some
libraries like the floor similar
library that roof is leaking
they're going to put it towards
that the pleblo of
fantalibrations hoping to expand
they don't have enough money
right now so they are going to
put the money towards that.
Um.
The important fairly libraries
planning system is following a
part they are going to put money
towards that so really basic
needs are going to be covered
by this year's fifteen thousand
dollars dispersement and
hopefully almost for about forty
five thousand dollars a year in
the future if the endowme.
Okay
we were asked during the inn.
See zero.
The governor has asked for ten
million.
So so that's a possibility that
ma.
Yeah.
Anybody and support.
Okay would you like to speak and
support our just show you.
The.
It does.
Hello.
The.
Hello.
Yes please speak up
thank you
i'm joseph
the cocher of the.
Legislation committee of the new
mexican library association i'm
association support senate bill
when seventy and we
will second work so now mark has
told you about the.
Impact of these funds on these
rural libraries.
I like to visit those libraries
and I come up with the analogy
it places where the railroad
don't stop here anymore and
we're thrilled that carriers
it has emerged as a new library
that will have his steady
the stream of support to enable
them to do that the things that
they are starting to do in that
kind of community
we are.
Impressed with child's show my
marks initiative in seeing a
solution to the problem because
these are our.
Um
then the smaller the community
if they have a rural library it
becomes more than that it
becomes a community center in
you can look at imbudo as as the
prime example of the
wonderful spin asked that they
have like a government close a
radio station that
you will power radio station
works out of the library so the
cultural impets are incredible
thank you for
your attention in your support
for the first and the bill one
seventy and thanks to sender or
teasing pin offer carrying it
hope you can
get it fully funded.
Thank you thank you and thank
you for your purchases.
Okay.
When you do talk about labor.
Yeah.
Thank you very much for so would
you start the soft habit.
Since the funding has been
available.
The.
Yes.
You expect how many more to keep
coming online.
Well there is there are about
nine villages that are trying to
start libraries that I know
about five l.
The.
Got it.
To your you're not meeting your
goal now.
You see the problem you've
created right.
You if your community needs a
library here's a method.
The.
That I had a problem.
It may mean that we have to.
You know I don't I don't know
how these translatence in this
digital age.
In the same way but but there
was a.
Part of this digital edge.
There is a there was a study
done about.
Students.
And it studied one thing.
The number of books.
It didn't study what the books
were it didn't look at anything
else that is when I counted the
number of books in the ho.
And there was a one to one
correlation a direct
correlation.
Between.
Access to bo.
Students.
Particularly this especially.
Having libraries in a community.
Agree it's a great problem.
Shows and it.
The rural libraries and down
before
thank you and for those online
we are on senate bill one thirty
one new mexico bowl advertising
list senator m.
Thank you for joining us.
Thank you madame charle members
this is cynical one thirty one
and this is similar economic
analysis as the the connie mac
bill.
But also the the tourism
secretary of santa language and
so there's an amendment out as
the cooking okay are committed
to consider
we do have an amendment here.
Or senate bill one thirty one on
page one
lanes eleven and twelve
I think they're passing out the
amendment purchase
advertisements commercials and
plublicity or an insert in lou
there of sponsors.
Part of the amendment on page
one line thirteen straight via
television.
Another on page one line
nineteen strike purchase
advertisement.
And insert in their sponsor.
On page one lines twenty and
twenty one strike via.
Thank you madame chair so we
introduced the bill.
And we kept it broad you know
advertisements commercials and
publicity.
The tourism department email me
and would prefer this language
this language is cleaner you
know in house bill to.
Does the same thing essentially.
And gives the department more
flexibility so we'd just prefer
the the words sponsor.
Proposal m.
Madame chair correct the tourism
department suggested this
language if in fact this bill
were to go in house house
beltward prefer the language
suggested in the amendment for
actions yes please.
You have sent a bill one thirty
one
we will talk about the bill now
thank you madame chair
honourable members so the new
mexico ball was actually is one
of the most popular and well
organized ball games outside of
new year's day when I say near
stay i'm talking roseball sugar
by orange ball but this is one
of the most organized and and
respected ball games outside of
the major bowls it's been into
mexico since two thousand six
the executive director mister
jeffs and yet it is out of town
he regrets not being here
but essentially the the sports
authority division of the
tourism department helped
organize the original ball game
and the appropriations in the
first four years of the ball
game from the state and mexico
were three hundred thousand
three hundred fifteen thousand
three hundred thirty one
thousand and three hundred forty
seven thousand and then of
course the banks crashed and and
everything went went crazy even
under the martinis
administration during its eight
years the average sponsorship
was in the neighborhood of a
hundred twenty five thousand.
So the last four years it's been
kind of hit and mass it went
from zero to a hundred thousand
and three hundred thousand
hundred thousand so we want to
institutionalize that
appropriation it we are the
along with his let the pueblo
the statement is the title
sponsor.
The the the ball game has
struggled with granting.
Corporate exclusiveness to a
sponsor but it's kept the the
name new mexico in there because
it's something that that our
whole state could take a pride
in it is the number one grt
revenue generator of any single
event in the state in mexico
obviously the bloom faster but
that's two weeks long or or nine
days long rather and so
we are I think it's it's a dual
so.
For for the tourism department
to advertise and sponsor the
restaurant bull it's it's gets
three for one one as it gets tv
commercials which it would
purchase anyway too it it
superizes and promotes the
fantastic bowl game that has
fantastic economic drivers
throughout the state and three
at promotes new mexico and
general as the destination point
throughout the country the
the fire suggests that only.
The two teams watched the ball
game that's not true the entire
country watches the ball game
it's on a saturday which is you
know it's not on our tuesday
night it's on saturday afternoon
smack dab right before christmas
and really kicks up the bull
season nationally so.
So with that i'll stand for
questions.
We have anybody.
Yeah.
Thank you madame chair center on
the last three years was a one
hundred thousand three hundred
thousand one hundred thousand
expenditure on the ball game but
we want to lock it in at three
hundred thousand dollars a year
it would help up.
Bring consistency and and and
solidify the ball game as the
new mexican boats it's currently
it's the is this left in a
mexican born is led that has a I
think there are they got the
naming rights for like half a
million dollars but we want to
keep new mexico in the ball.
As a name of the ball.
The.
Then thank you madame jersey or
neil so they the bill is a three
hundred thousand dollars it's a
nine hundred thousand dollar
property three hundred thousand
dollars each of the next three.
Thank you madame i'm not I
believe it's a either a three or
five year deal for a sleep that
public is led to casino rather
correct somewhere in the
neighborhood of.
I believe it's in the
neighborhood of half a minute
per year the naming rights to
this ball.
Thank you matter I will let the
remorse know who has baby duty
this morning
hopefully he gets.
And those online
I don't think we have any other
bills referred to this committee
so we will not be beating on
thursday.
And it's way yeah so we will
probably be back here next
tuesday we will see what if
anything.
Thank you committee members for
joining us today and thank you
for those online great day.
Yeah.
