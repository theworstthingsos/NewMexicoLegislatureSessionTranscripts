Representative Henry.
Represented Montoya here.
Representative Murphy.
represents an acortez here
representing small.
First.
Cheered McQueen.
We have.
OK, we will meet uh Saturday at
8 o'clock in this room. Uh,
we'll get that agenda out, um.
Hopefully today. Uh, anything
from the committee, uh, before
we begin?
OK.
Good morning, Chair. Good
morning, Senator.
Uh, please start off whenever
you're ready. Thank you very
much, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee. It's great to go
ahead and be before you this
morning.
Uh, Senate Bill 5 is amended is
a uh.
The ill laughter, a lot of hard
work, not only throughout the
interim, but for many years. And
within the pieces of this bill,
as we've talked about, uh, fee
increases as we've looked at
governance and more importantly,
as we continue to deal with uh
wildlife in New Mexico.
Uh, this is a culmination of a
lot of those uh issues and as we
move forward, um, I just have
some brief opening remarks, and
then of course I'm going to
defer to uh my co-sponsor
representing McQueen, who uh has
spent a lot of time uh and
effort in helping to put forth
so many of these issues and of
course to the people on both
sides of the issue as we move
forward and how really want to
thank them because
Uh, there's been a lot of give
and take in this piece of
legislation, and our hopes are
as it goes through that this
definitely remakes if you will,
the way we treat our
environment, our wildlife, and
more importantly, um, our state
as we move forward with a clean
environment and a place for our
animals, if you will, to roam
and uh our fish to swim. So
within that, uh, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee, uh,
New Mexico has a long and proud
history of taking care of.
Our wildlife.
The Department of Game and Fish
was founded on the need to
provide a sustainable food
supply for our citizens.
Many who still hunt and fish to
feed their families today.
This bill honors those
traditions and ensures we hand
down a well-funded department
and functioning game commission.
The future generations of our
great state.
To me having a healthy wildlife
management system means having
healthy communities, a healthy
food supply, and a healthy
economy.
We owe it to the hunters and
anglers who provide funding to
the department through their
license fees to take care of our
game, fish and wildlife species.
wildlife management has become
more costly and we facing new
threats.
For example, my community in the
area that I represent.
I see the damaging ripple
effects that fire and floods
have had on the environment.
From the lakes we fished to the
mountains, we hunt in.
And that continues today as we
continue to go through a drought
period, as we see animals
searching, if you will, for a
place to live and of course
their own environment and food
to eat.
We need the uh Department of
Game and Fish to have the tools.
Authority and funding to
maintain healthy populations of
our wildlife.
And ensure they are protected in
their natural habitats.
This bill seeks to do that. It
is a product of years, as I've
mentioned already, of
negotiations and bipartisan
support amongst legislators and
the representatives of the many
voices.
Here in New Mexico.
I ask my colleague.
Who has become, if you will, a
respected and admired friend of
mine as we've dealt with this
bill.
Because he is not only
knowledgeable in terms of what
the facts are.
But more than that, his heart is
committed to ensure.
That we leave New Mexico in a
much better place for future
generations. So at this time,
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee.
I would like to defer to
representing McQueen to further
elaborate and to start talking
about the technical pieces of
this particular bill. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Thank you, Senator.
Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chair
and thank you, uh, Senator
Campos and Senator, thank you
for your, your work and your
leadership on this issue I'd
like to also thank our other uh
sponsors, uh, include Senator
Wirth, uh, Senator Brantly, and
of course our own uh chairman
Small. Uh, we're joined today by
Jesse Debell of the
in New Mexico while the
Federation and uh Judy Coleman
with Audubon Southwest.
who can help those ants answer
any questions.
I sort of wanted to go over um
how we got to where we are
today.
Uh, so this bill started in the
Senate and got 3 committee
referrals.
Um, at each, uh, stage, there
was a robust debate.
Uh, and it eats each stage,
including the floor.
The bill picked up amendments.
Um, so coming over to the house,
we had a bill uh plus 3
committee reports plus a floor.
And so to try to clean that up.
And make it more readable.
Uh, we put that into a single uh
standalone amendment.
Um, which is before you, uh,
which is, which probably have
that motion to consider the
amendment. Great. Uh, at this
time we'll accept the motion to
accept the proposed uh healthy
amendment to
Bill
as Tracy.
I believe we have to,
I believe we have to, uh, for
discussion, for discussion, yes
sir.
Uh, so, OK.
Great. It's been moved and
seconded by Montoya
representurolo for discussion.
OK, so, um, thank you, Mr.
Chair. The, the amendment which
is, uh, it's available online,
it's 231-642.2.
Um, there are 3
Uh, changes in the amendment
which are not reflected uh or
which did not come from the
prior amendments of 3 additional
changes that we've made so far,
uh, for this committee. Uh,
first is that
Uh, the Senate, uh, upped the
price for the sheep tag.
Uh, I think it was 3150 or
3,125, they upped that to $9000.
Um, at $3000 Archi tag was the
most expensive in the West.
Uh, so we felt that tripling
that uh was uh a bit too much.
Uh, so we've dialed that back,
the $3500 in the amendment.
Um, there's also added a
non-resident uh shed collector
fee.
Um, and that was set at $500.
The highest fee that we found in
the West, I think it was Idaho
was something like 185.
Uh, so again, we dialed that
back to $200.
And then, uh, to help make up
for any potential lost revenue,
we bumped the non-resonant game
hunting fee.
From, uh, the proposed change
had been to $85. We bumped that
up by $5 to $90.
So those those are the three
changes that exist in the
amendment.
Um, what I would like to do is
propose uh a few additional
changes to the amendment.
And how, uh, I would expect this
to work.
is if the amendment is adopted,
if these additional changes are
adopted.
We would get a 0.3 amendment,
and then, of course, the
amendment is input into the
committee report, and that's how
it'd be reported out of this
committee, if passed.
So you just the additional
changes there's uh there's
really just two, although they
appear in different pages, um.
On page 5 of the amendment.
In the pieces are the upper
right hand corner.
Um, at the end of the removal
section.
Uh, we would propose, or I would
propose, adding a final decision
by the district court and action
brought pursuant to subsections
G or F of this section.
may be appealed directly to the
Supreme Court.
So this is uh this is an attempt
to expedite any removal process,
um, if it goes to district court
and then goes to the Court of
Appeals and then goes to the
Supreme Court, uh, that adds an
additional
Uh, year, year and a half, maybe
2 years at the Court of Appeals.
Uh, so we would just adding that
language, and I can um
read that language more slowly
if that helps.
OK.
So it's at the end of section G
if you look at section G, this
is the removal language and it
already uh has a removal being
brought in district court.
So that suggested additional
language would be
A final decision.
by a district court.
In an action.
Brought pursuant to subsections
G or F of this section.
May be appealed.
Directly
To the
OK, thank you for that and uh uh
chair Senator, do you want to go
through those amendments
individually, or should we do
those, we have to take action on
the first overall amendment and
then you're outlining the three
additional verbal amendments,
would we do those individually
or as a, we'll do those as a
whole after you finish
explaining I think that's a good
idea. I just have, I just have
one more um.
Uh, then on page 16 of the bill.
So we, when we added the um no
when you had the non-resident
shed license type, we included a
a different section of
Um, uh, chapter 17, which had
previously been in the bill.
And that pulled in some
language.
The existing state law, if you
look at um
Sections I and G on page 16.
Uh, it uses the word
handicapped.
And we received a message from
uh the governor's commission on
the disabled, uh, that they
would prefer that to use the
word disabled.
Um, and so the, the other
amendment would simply be uh
changing each instance of the
word handicapped.
And I and J uh to disabled.
And then the word handicap also
appears in the table of um
License fees
On page 21.
And page and twice on page 23.
Great. OK. Uh, members, I see
everybody's tracking and getting
those on there.
And Mr. Chair be my suggestion
that we adopt those amendments
and then we just work from this
amendment.
Um, and then, of course, you
know, at the end of the debate,
you know, we can vote whether or
not to advance the the bill as.
OK.
OK, uh, thank you very much. Any
questions on, we're, we're doing
the first amendment. Uh, there's
a motion to adopt from
Representative Garcia, uh.
On the amendment, uh, on the
first, the, yeah, on Twitter.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um, Chairman Small.
Chairman Queen, um.
Were there any, um,
Any changes.
To amendments.
That were made
Uh, through the process on the
Senate side. Is there anything
In this amendment that changes
any of the language.
From an amendment that was that
as it made its way through the
Senate.
And the reason I'm asking that
uh Mr. Chairman and Chairman
McQueen is this if any changes
that we make here is gonna have
to go back for concurrence, and
if not concurrence, they'd have
to go to conference, so, um,
along the way, um, Mr. Chair,
uh, chair and senator, um.
If we make changes to anything
that was agreed upon along the
way. There's a potential for
Disagreement between chambers.
Uh, Mr. Cha San Montoya, yes,
um, so the, the 3 changes were
those fees that I mentioned at
the cheap tag, the shed fee, and
um
bumping the non-resident uh game
hunting license by $5. Those are
the three changes, um, there was
what I believe is a
The wording, um,
Change in it's actually on page
4 section B, um, in the Senate,
uh, they turned one of the
at-large members into a tribal
position, and there was some
discussion about
Um, we wanted a federally
recognized uh Indian nation
tribal pueblo.
that the tribe itself was in New
Mexico. Uh, so we didn't, uh,
the goal wasn't to have a tribal
member from, say, a Midwestern
tribe it was, it was to have a
member from a New Mexico tribe,
and there was some question
about
Where the word the qualifier in
New Mexico would, would be put
and we ended up at the end.
And that was actually there was
an amendment in Senate rules. It
was changed on the Senate floor,
and I think this reflects a
minor wording change, but other
than that, the initial
amendment, the uh the document.
document number that I read.
Uh, the, the goal there was
simply to consolidate all the
different documents into one and
not make further changes.
That being said, because we are
making some changes, there will
have to be concurrent.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, uh, uh,
Chair McQueen, on, on, on page
9,
under new material, uh, while it
might to be protected, item B
towards the bottom of the page.
Um, it reads when determining
whether and how to protect the
species of wildlife, the
commission shall consider
Um, I, I was, uh, under the
impression that that word had
been changed to May.
In the uh process are we
changing that back to Shell?
On page 9 of your amendment. So,
um, Mr. Chair Montoya, I don't
have the other various
amendments in front of me, uh,
in
Uh, Senate rules, there was a
request to change a shall to me.
And we, we accepted that as a
friendly amendment.
After Senate rules.
Uh, the people who made that
request came to us and said,
Oops, we changed the wrong shell
to me, and what we really want
to do is change this other shell
to me, and I can't tell you
where it is.
Um, so in Senate,
Conservation, the Senate rule
amendment.
Amendment was stricken and then
a new amendment was put on to
change a different.
Shall I mean.
OK. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just
uh making sure that if this goes
through the process that
goes back to the Senate that
that we didn't change something
substantially.
That was changed to get it to
where it is. That, that's all I
have, Mr. Chair. Great. Thank
you very much, Roel Motoya. OK,
we have a motion to adopt uh the
uh house energy First Amendment.
Is there any objection to that
motion?
then we've adopted that.
Sorry.
OK. Uh, now, can we have a
motion in a second for uh the
Chairman McQueen's verbal
amendment.
Moved it up, Mister Chair.
and moved by
uh er and Garcia, seconded by
Representative Odeta. Is there
any objection to that motion?
Discussions.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and and
chair um McQueen, uh, just
I know it's just, just a
statement. It's not normally our
practice to
on the fly and usually
Get advance notice, but doesn't
seem to be
To
big of a deal, so don't want to
make too big of an issue of it,
it's just, uh, maybe.
If we in the future, we may need
to sim similar consideration if
we
Uh, want to change something in
here on the fly.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you.
OK, uh, any objection to
adopting that amendment seeing
then we've adopted that.
Now, we're gonna go uh back to
our amended bill, um, is there
anything that
Presenters wish to add, then
we're going to go to public
comment and then we'll go to the
committee, Mr. Chair, if I may,
I'd like to, I'd like to walk
the committee through the bill.
Sounds great. OK.
Um, so thank you all for, um, I
think that we're all clear on,
on what we're looking at, what
we're working on. Um, I wanna
first sort of highlight some
things.
Uh, that the bill does not do.
Um, because there's, you know,
there's, there's a lot of
interest in this bill.
And there's been a lot of
discussion, um, and sometimes,
um, some people can get the
wrong idea.
Uh, so it doesn't, uh, repeal
the general, uh, which allows
Landowners to kill animals on
private property when they're
damaging that private property.
It doesn't change the E+ system
for L tags.
not in this bill.
doesn't allow the Department of
Game and fish to designate a
species as endangered.
Or does need critical habitat.
Uh, those are federal concepts,
not part of this bill.
And it's, it's not.
Uh, intended to divert the
attention of the department away
from hunting and fishing. Uh,
hunting and fishing.
As uh a substantial historical,
cultural, and economic uh
history in New Mexico in
importance in New Mexico, and
we're not trying to take away
from that.
What we're trying to do is
expand and clarify the mission
of the department to be a
full-fledged wildlife agency.
Which
And always they already are.
And we're just clarifying that
and modernizing that.
But I wanted to lay that out.
Uh, the process, um,
Uh, Senator Campos alluded to
the process. Uh, it's been
substantial. Uh, I think I
started working on this.
Um, probably 8 years ago, maybe
9.
Um
In the interim, in this past
interim, you know, we, we've had
a couple of bills. I had a bill
that was pocket vetoed two years
ago.
Uh, in past and the, the
governor's office, to their
credit, I believe, uh, convened
a large group of stakeholders to
discuss this issue.
Uh, we had meetings in the
cabinet room up on the 4th floor
if you've been there. Uh,
there's a giant, uh, stone table
in the middle.
Uh, in every seat around that
table was taken and chairs along
the wall were full as well.
So there were quite a few people
involved in this, um.
Uh, broad array of stakeholders
from different points of view.
Uh, I will say,
Not every single person who
might be interested was in that
room.
Um, but it still was a very
large group, and I think we had
a very good
Result.
So the bill, as I conceive of
it, um, has 4 parts, uh, and
they, of course, all relate to
the Department of game and fish
and became commission.
So the first part.
Clarifies the mission of the
department.
Uh, the department will tell you
that they already worked on
non-game species. That's true.
Uh, the FIR states that the
agency already considers and
manages a broad range of
species.
So what this bill does is
clarify that they have the
authority.
To manage any species in New
Mexico.
And the discretion not to.
And that was a goal of the bill.
We're not trying to mandate um
Did they get involved in any
particular species.
So the bill combines authority.
With discretion.
The second part reforms the game
commission.
And the goal here has been to be
bring uh stability and
professionalism to the
commission. So in the past, you
know, what's happened is the
commission serves at the will of
the governor.
And every time we get a new
governor, we get a new
commission.
And so there's a lot of turnover
and there's been turnover, um,
you know, within, uh, different
administrations and there have
been times where we, uh, the
commission has had a hard time
achieving a quorum.
Because they're missing uh
members, members haven't been
appointed.
Um
So this bill would maintain the
current structure of 3 at-large
seats.
Um, the seats would have
geographic and political party
diversity.
Uh, it creates 4 position seats,
so the total commission stays at
7.
The position seats are sort of
they're sort of little job
description or or qualification
for each of these.
Um, and they include the rancher
or farmer.
A hunter angler, and you have to
be bold.
A conservationist, so sort of
um, you know, non consumptive,
uh, wildlife, um, person.
And a scientist.
Um, one comment that comes up a
lot in working on this bill this
year and in past years is why is
there only um one hunter angular
position.
And
What you, what you need to
understand is that
This is the minimum.
It's in no way a maximum.
And it, in all likelihood, as in
the past.
We'll have multiple hunters and
anglers.
Because the, the farmer or
rancher could be a hunter. The
conservationist could be an
angler. The large members
certainly could be hunters and
anglers.
Um, so, you know, we, we
elevated, uh, that position
because we, we thought it was
important to make sure that was
a minimum.
The current statute doesn't have
that.
So when people say, oh, why, why
do you only have one?
First off, we don't intend for
there only be one, and secondly,
that's one more than we
currently have.
So I think that's a step in the
right direction.
Um, the bill also creates a
nominating committee. So in the
past, the governor has, you
know,
Interviewed people and selected
people for these positions.
So in order to take some of the
politics out of the process, we
have created a nominating
committee which will submit a
list to the governor.
And the governor has to pick
from the list, and this is what
we've done, uh, with the PRC.
This is what we do with regions,
this is what we do with um
judges.
And this is just a way of having
a a filter, you know, so we will
have a group of people, don't
get to that, there's 9 of them,
you know, that
Uh, candidates, so we have good
candidates for these positions.
And then the governor will pick
from that list.
Um, the nominating committee
consists of 9 members.
There are 4 from the political
leadership of the legislature.
So one from the Sanrote, one
from the speaker and then one
from the minority leader in each
chamber.
So we, so we have legislative
representation on the nominating
committee and it is of course
bipartisan.
There are 2 scientists
positions, uh, department heads
at UNM in New Mexico State.
Uh, there are two sort of at
large appointments from the
governor, and then there's a 3rd
appointment from the governor.
Um, who has to be a tribal
member.
Uh, and then finally in the
commission portion of the bill,
we create 4 advisory positions,
non-voting positions, and these
are the heads of the outdoor
recreation division of the
Department of Agriculture, the
state land Office and the
Department of Indian Affairs.
And the goal here is just to
increase communication between
these agencies.
And, you know, as you can
imagine, uh, wildlife issues,
uh, cross agency boundaries,
right? So outdoor work or
wildlife is incredibly important
to outdoor recreation. People
want to go and see wildlife.
That's important.
that has obvious interest the
land office, um, one of the
largest landowners, not the
largest landowner in the state.
Andar of Indian affairs.
The third part of the bill
increases on the fishing piece.
Uh, and these haven't been
increased in approximately 20
years.
Um, this is something the agency
has sought for a couple of
years.
And this is something that we
want to include as part of this
overall reform package.
Um, so once we pump up those
fees, uh, we then also had a CPI
adjuster, uh, so the, in the, in
the future, the agency can sort
of keep pace with inflation.
And then the fourth part of the
bill, which I think is critical,
um,
It isn't actually in the bill.
Uh, but that's fun.
Uh, when I started working on
this and we were, we're we're
talking about reforming and
making of fish, and including
this, you know, expanded
mission.
It was clear from day one.
that we couldn't pay for that
with honey and fishing licenses.
But that didn't seem fair, that
if we wanted to ask the
department to expand its
mission, we need to get them.
additional sources of funding.
So the department is already
receiving approximately $3
million a year, uh, through the
land of enchantment Legacy Fund,
um, my understanding is they're
using that money uh to address
species of various conservation
need.
Which may or may not be a game
species, I think mostly not, but
they could include game species.
And then there's an additional
um 10.5 million in the budget.
Um, 3. I think 3.5 over 3 years
of grow money government results
and opportunity, and this is the
way to get um
Uh, funding to the department
and uh as you probably know
that, you know, it's sort of a
3-year period, and then once
they put that money to use and
um uh show good results that
money can become a permanent
recurring funding for that
agency.
So that's, that's how we've
addressed the funding piece, and
it's, I think it's really
important to mention that even
though it's not actually in uh
the bill in front of you.
Um, and finally, I'd just like
to say, you know, we appreciate.
Uh, the staff at the department
came and fish, um, you know, I,
I
Uh, I was once I government
employee myself. Uh, I've always
had uh
Uh, very good, uh, interactions
with government employees, we
think they are hard-working
conscientious individuals, and
we want to get them the tools
that they need, uh, to do their
job well. Uh, so with that, I
would ask for your support, I'd
be happy to answer any
questions.
Great. Uh thank you very much,
uh, Chair. Thank you very much,
Senator. Good uh experts. We're
gonna go now to public comment,
as is the practice for the
committee will take 3 in person,
2 online. We'll ask folks to
raise their hands just to be
able to show and recognize sort
of where folks are. We're going
to start in person opposition,
please raise your hand if you're
here in person in opposition,
right, and if 3 folks could come
up.
We'll do 3 in person.
Please go ahead.
Tell us, yeah, just tell us your
name. Sorry, and there's a note,
uh, our practice is 2 minutes of
public comment.
purpose.
Chair, members of the committee.
My name is Brandon Wynn. I live
in Albuquerque. Um, my children,
my 4 children are 6th generation
New Mexicans. Um, I'm not a
lobbyist. I've never been paid
to advocate for New Mexico
hunters, that's what I
specifically have worked for 30
years for, for no pay just as
volunteer. So this bill has a
lot of great stuff. It fixes a
lot of really big problems with
New Mexico wildlife Management,
especially the game commission
appointment process. I think
they cleaned it up very nicely,
but
The one thing this bill doesn't
address in any way, shape or
form is to me the biggest thing
where New Mexico is the biggest
outlier in the West, and that is
the privatization of the big
game tags. No state in the West
does it like New Mexico. There's
only 19,000 private landowner el
tags in the entire Rocky
Mountain West, 14,000 of them
come out of New Mexico. So
basically, the legislature and
the game commission has stolen
from the Mexican.
residents, you know, uh, some of
the sponsors talk about the food
supply and everything. Well,
what our system does, it puts
trophy heads on walls in
Houston, not food in New
Mexicans refrigerators. I have a
solution for that. They proposed
raising the game hunting license
fee to $90. I propose that you
change that to $110 generate
another a million dollars that
you can buy down some of these
non-resident tags so the
department, if we have a good,
honest commission.
which is the point, you need to
give them the money to be able
to sell less non-resident tax.
And another thing I would do is
I would eliminate the
non-resident standard elf
license fee and sell all the
bull either sex, elk licenses in
New Mexico at the quality high
demand thing that will generate
about $2.5 million money that an
honest game commission would use
in the future to buy down all
these non-resident private super
rich, what they call in Montana.
Bulls for billionaires tags, so
that's what I ask is that you
make these simple funding
changes, please do this for New
Mexico resident hunters, you got
nothing for us here. Thank you
very much.
Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee, Howard Hutchinson,
um, number one with the San
Francisco Sola Mo Conservation
District, and on my registered
lobbyist for the coalition of
Arizona Mexico counties.
Respectfully to to the sponsors
who we've recognized for a long
time a possible need for the
change in appointment of the
game commission.
However
I was a member of the
negotiating team and drafter for
the wildlife Conservation Act in
1995.
What we came to an agreement in
that there's a distinction
between conservation management
for threatened and endangered
species and for species of
concern.
And we wanted to make it a clear
distinction at that point.
To create a separate portion of
the commission's powers.
to address that.
And leave the science of
management of game.
As it is
They, they can.
They have a hard time doing that
with the with the staffing and
and the funding that they get.
But we think that this um
this combination of the two
concepts of management is gonna
detract for from the game that's
available for hunting and
fishing in New Mexico.
And could dilute the management
for species of concern.
Thank you for the consideration
of the time of Mr. Chairman and
members. Thank you very much.
Mr. Chair, committee members, my
name is Tom Patterson.
I serve as President-elect of
the New Mexico Cattle Growers
Association, and for many years
chair of our wildlife.
Committee Wildlife in New Mexico
are principally found in rural
New Mexico.
Rural New Mexico is where we
produce our cattle. What the
game commission and the
department do.
is not theoretical to us.
Their actions affect us in our
daily lives and in our livestock
operations.
Cattle growers opposes Senate
Bill 5.
We are joined in that opposition
by the New Mexico Farm Bureau.
And by the northern New
Mexicotockman's Association.
And so the record is clear in
case it comes up.
We agree that the department
needs a fee increase, a
reasonable one, and yes, cattle
growers provided this house
sponsor with the definition for
a rancher or a farmer when he
asked us for one.
But contrary.
Contrary to what was reported
repeatedly in the other chamber
during debate on Saturday. We
have consistently opposed SB 5.
We oppose SB 5 principally
because of sections 5A and 5D.
They are brand new.
We've read 5A and 5D. We've
reviewed chapter 17, that's
referenced. We asked the
department, does Section 5A
authorize the department to do
something that it isn't
currently authorized to do.
The answer is yes.
As the sponsor has acknowledged
here this morning historically
the legislature has controlled
the species of wildlife that the
commission manages and protects.
Under its express words section
5A transfers your legislative
prerogative and control to the
Game commission decide which
species of wildlife as defined
in Section 5D. Please go ahead
to manage.
And that's across New Mexico. We
urge you to vote no. Thank you.
OK. Uh, now, we're gonna go
online.
Um
We've got uh I believe we're
gonna start with uh uh I've been
Jane
And this is an opposition to
Senate Bill 5 as amended.
Mr. Chair and members of the
committee. My name is Ivan
Valdez. I am a fly fishing guide
and also the owner of the real
life fly shop in Santa Fe.
As an avid hunter and a business
owner who depends on outdoor
recreation, particularly fly
fishing.
I stand.
Go ahead.
I stand in strong support of SB
5 I'm gonna ask you to stop
there. We're in opposition
online. Apologies.
Uh, we have one hand raised in
opposition, uh, Mr. Thomas
Shelley, are you wishing to
speak in opposition. If you are,
please go ahead for 2 minutes.
OK. Um, uh, Mr. Shelley, we've
got you, uh, it seems like the
microphone is unmuted, but we
can't hear anything yet in the.
Can you hear me now, Mr.
Chairman? We can, uh, very well,
a little bit more, that's, but
that's great. Uh, we're gonna go
to you.
Sorry.
We're gonna go to you for 2
minutes starting now.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name
is Tom Shelley. I'm a cattle
rancher, vice president of Grant
County Cattle Growers, and a
Grant County commissioner.
I oppose SB 5. The department
needs a license fee increase.
Our resident hunters want more
in-state licenses and less out
of state licenses. We have a
great, a, a game commission
that's responsive and is
working. Most of our
commissioners have agriculture
ties, and that is a good thing.
One designated commissioner in
this bill with ties to an
understanding of agriculture is
unacceptable. New Mexico
families want the
crime, and economy to be
addressed, not the recreation of
the fish and wildlife Service at
the state level. This bill will
dilute the effectiveness of the
current wildlife program and
ultimately will cost New Mexican
families at a time we cannot
afford it. I urge you to vote no
on this bill. A fair license fee
increase absolutely the rest of
it, no. Thank you.
Great. Thank you very much.
OK, uh, now we're gonna go uh to
uh those who are here in
support, first, if everybody
who's here in support would
raise your hands.
No, and then we'll have 3 folks
come on up.
for 2 minutes.
Go ahead.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good
morning, committee members.
Carrie Romero, executive
director and registered lobbyist
for the New Mexico Council of
Outfitters and Guides. I want to
say that we were originally in
opposition to this bill over the
interim and even at the
beginning of this session.
However, through the legislative
process, the sponsors and other
stakeholders have worked with us
to develop this bill, which is a
compromise among many of the
stakeholders, the majority of
the stakeholders.
It seems like much of the
remaining opposition are from
those who just have an indirect
working relationship with the
Department of Game and Fish and
lack of clear understanding of
the provisions in the existing
chapter 17 statute. This bill
changes just a small portion of
chapter 17. It's a key portion,
and there is some legitimate
risk, but not the risks that are
being voiced by the opposition,
and I would note that there is
also legitimate risk in the
existing statute as it is today,
if this bill isn't passed.
The groups that work directly
with Chapter 17 on a daily basis
are in favor of this bill. The
outfitting industry works
closely with game and fish. They
issue our outfitter and guide
operational licenses. They
regulate our clientele through
hunting and fishing licenses,
and they enforce our industry on
both the administrative as well
as the criminal side. Working
with game and fish is how the
outfitting industry functions.
It has always been in our best
interest to make sure that if
this bill passes, it passes in a
form that we can live with.
There are many good things in
this bill that would improve
chapter 17. Game commission
reform is at the top of the
list. License fee increase, yes,
it's needed. Many outfitters
like the creation of a shed
hunting season, and there are
even portions within the
expanded take section that would
benefit the industry. There are
many good things and the bad
things have been amended, so
that they are at the point where
they're not tolerable. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, uh, members of the
committee, Debbie Hughes, I'm
the executive director with the
Association of Conservation
Districts, and I just uh had the
opportunity to meet with my
board night before last. They
are still in support. They
understand it's been a very
diverse group working with all
the sponsors, um, I myself am
also a farmer and rancher, and
we have hunting on our ranch,
but the soil and water districts
work closely with game and fish
to habitat restoration projects
and what our goal is, is to do
restoration.
Projects so we can keep species
from being listed. That's the
way we need to work together. So
thank you very much.
Thank you.
Good morning, Chairman Small
committee members for the
record, Dan Roper which tried
Unlimited. Uh, I'd like to start
by stressing to you that this
legislation is broadly supported
by New Mexico's hunting and
fishing community. In addition
to Trout Unlimited, this bill is
supported by nearly every
organization we worked with in
New Mexico that represents the
interests of hunters and
anglers. Those groups include
Impact Outdoors, the Theodore
Roosevelt Conservation
Partnership, Ducks Unlimited,
Backcountry Hunters and Anglers,
and many others. Uh, as you
heard from the bill sponsors,
uh,
this bill addresses three major
challenges to wildlife
management today, and
underfunded agency, a game
commission in need of reform and
a lack of clarity around which
species the department can
manage. From our point of view,
uh, we need to do more work for
all of New Mexico's wildlife,
the species we hunt and fish as
well as the species we don't,
we're confident that this bill,
when coupled with new
investments from the land of
enchantment Legacy Fund, new
funding proposed in House Bill
2. It puts us definitively on
the path
have to do that. Just this bill
alone generates 9 to $10 million
in new revenue that will allow
the department to do a lot of
great work. Uh, the last thing
I'll add, uh, well, maybe two
things. Uh, just one, we have no
doubt passage of this bill will
be a vast improvement over the
status quo.
The second thing I'll say is
this is a bipartisan bill. It
enjoyed bipartisan support on
the Senate side, and we
sincerely hope to carry that
over uh today and going forward
in the house. Thank you.
Great. Thank you very much. OK,
we're gonna conclude, uh, we're
gonna go online starting with
Jeremy Romero for 2 minutes and
then going to I've been, uh,
next.
Mr. Romero
Here.
And members of the committee. My
name is Jeremy Romero. As a
lifelong resident and sportsman
in New Mexico. I pride myself in
continuing the hunting
traditions that New Mexico
provides. Traditions that have
been passed down to me by past
generations and traditions that
I hoped to pass down to future
generations. Senate Bill 5 take
an important step towards giving
the Department of Game and Fish
the authority to manage both
game and non-game species. I
believe that broadening the
department's mission will
further assist in preventing the
biodiversity.
crisis was simultaneously
working to promote, enhance, and
restore wildlife habitat for
game and non-game species.
Additionally, I also know the
men and women working at the at
the Department of Game and Fish
have a difficult job in managing
our cherished wildlife species
and habitat. While doing so was
severely limited resources.
The proposed license fee
increase in Senate Bill 5 will
provide much needed resources to
the department. As a as a
lifelong sportsman, I would
without a doubt pay the
increased license fees.
Mr. Chair and members of the
committee, I would like to
conclude by expressing my strong
support for Senate Bill 5.
Great. Thank you. Thank you very
much. We're gonna conclude uh
our online with Ivan. Ivan, go
ahead and support.
Mr. Chair and members of the
committee. My name is Ivan
Valdez.
I'm a fly fishing guide, and
also the owner of the real life
fly shop in Santa Fe.
As an avid hunter and a business
owner who depends on outdoor
recreation, particularly fly
fishing, I stand in strong
support of SB 5, especially want
to thank the bill sponsors for
welcoming an amendment to this
bill that allows for an
adjustment to the vendor fee
charged.
Private businesses who sell
hunting and fishing licenses on
behalf of the game and fish.
We are proud to sell an enormous
amount.
Of these licenses to our
customers every single year.
Since we entered the
partnership, the fee paid to us
for selling a license has always
been $1 per person.
Considering how things have
changed over the years. That's
just not enough to cover the
cost we incur to facilitate that
transaction.
SB 5 does so much to improve our
state wildlife agency, and with
this amendment, it also
strengthens the partnership the
agency has with entrepreneurs
like myself.
It's never been our goal or
intent to make money from
selling licenses for for the
department, but it shouldn't
cost us money either.
I encourage you to vote yes on
this bill, so we can continue to
grow and improve our wildlife
populations and the economic
benefits that wildlife provides
to business owners who depend on
it.
Thank you.
Great. Thank you very much. OK,
that concludes our public
comment. Uh, thank you, members
and thank you very much to
members in the audience and
online. Um, anything that uh
briefly want to add, we we're
gonna go to our uh committee
next. Mr. Chair, I think we're
ready for questions. Fantastic,
uh, questions, we'll go ahead
and start with Representative
Santa Cortez,
thank you so much, Mr. Chair,
Chairman, Senator, and experts.
Um, I can certainly appreciate
your eight-year journey up until
now, so
have some questions just so that
you can catch me up.
Mr. Chair and Chairman, what
exactly was the problem that
this bill is trying to fix by
changing the way game
commissioners are appointed.
Uh, Mr. Chair and San Cortez, so
as I alluded to, you know, what,
what we tend to have is, you
know, every time we get a new
governor, we get a new
commission because they serve at
the pleasure of the governor.
Uh, we've also had
Um, you know, we've had people
appointed to the commission at
times that maybe don't have good
background in these issues, uh,
and there have been people
who've been removed from the
commission, uh, because they
have taken a position that
whoever is governor at the time
doesn't like. So if we're asking
the commission to govern this
agency, we need to give them the
authority to actually do that.
So Mister Chair Chairman, has
there been a lot of complaints?
Uh
Mr. Chair, uh, Representative
Cortez, yes.
Mr. Cha Chairman, would you
share some of those?
Uh, Mr. Chair, Santa Cortez, uh,
you know, as I said, you know,
at times they've had a hard time
getting um a car, um, there have
been issues before the
commission, uh, they have been
controversial and commissioners
have taken up a certain position
and um
find out they're no longer
commissioners, uh, you know,
there's, uh, the commission has
uh been highly political, uh,
and I don't, you know, I'm not
singling out the current
governor by any stretch. I mean,
this goes back for a long time.
Mr. Chair Chairman, would it be
appropriate for me to ask when?
Uh, Mr. Cha represents a Cortez
for a long time.
Fair enough, Mr. Chair Chairman.
OK, so my next question is, Mr.
Chair, Chairman, is we're
current game commissioners
interviewed about the proposals
for appointment or retention.
Uh, Mr. Chair, uh,
Representative Cortez, uh, I,
you know, I have had
conversations with passing
commissioners. I, I have had uh
some, you know, uh, indirect
conversations, there are some
Uh, you know, sort of in the
hallway kind of conversations
with game posters, uh.
Mr. Dubell, did, were you
wanting to add to that?
Uh yes, thank you very much, Mr.
Chair Representative, uh, my
name is Jesse Dubell. I'm the
executive director of the New
Mexico Wildlife Federation. The
Wildlife Federation is New
Mexico's largest and oldest
sportsman's organization. We
advocate for hunting and fishing
in the state and the wildlife
Federation was instrumental in
the creation of the New Mexico
State Game Commission back in
1921. At that time, the purpose
of the commission was to
insulate wildlife management
decisions from politics.
Unfortunately, with the current
structure of the
commission. Commissioners can be
removed at any time without
cause. So you really don't have
the necessary insulation there.
As a result, the commission has
been extremely dysfunctional
that the turnover on the
commission is immense. We often
don't have enough commissioners
to form a quorum. Currently we
have a vacancy on the
commission. The Berlio County
representative resigned from the
commission on August 8th and
still hasn't been, the seat
still hasn't been filled prior
to the August 8th resignation,
that commissioner hadn't showed
up to
meeting since March. So we, we
have a very broken commission in
the state of New Mexico, 85% of
residents have gone without any
representation on the commission
in the past 3 years.
So this bill is absolutely
necessary to make our commission
functional. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you so much,
Mr. Chair, Chairman, and expert.
That was a very thorough
response. So going back to my
question, so were any of the
game commissioners interviewed
about any of the provisions in
SB 5?
Uh, thank you very much, Mr.
Chair and Representative. Uh, I
work with game commissioners on
a daily basis and uh have many
conversations with existing
commissioners as well as
commissioners who have been
removed. And so much of the
input that I've provided
throughout the last year that
we've been working on the bill
as a direct result of feedback I
have received from
commissioners, both past and
present.
So, Mr. Chair, Chairman,
Senator, and experts. Um, can
you agree that wildlife or
located mainly in rural New
Mexico. Um.
This chairs I'm sorry, Cortez,
uh, we have rich, uh, wildlife
diversity throughout the state,
uh, certainly, um, I, I think
your best chance to see them is
in rural New Mexico.
Excellent. Mr. Chair Chairman,
so currently we have district
representatives in the game
commission. Is that correct, Mr.
Chair, Chairman?
Um, Mr. Chair and secrets, so
the current structure is there
are appointments uh made up by
various groups of counties.
Um, and then there's some large
appointments there, there is one
appointment of the groups of
counties. I think one is simply
Bernalillo County. Uh, I think
most of the groups of counties
include uh county which um can
could be considered, you know,
urban. Um, you know, I, I think
the mix of game commissioners.
Um, we'll come through the
appointment process and we're
Um,
there's nothing in this bill
that would attempt to exclude uh
rural voices from the
commission.
So the reason I asked Mr. Chair
Chairman, Senator, and experts
is under this bill, could we end
up with a game commission whose
members don't live near the
wildlife or the citizens that
encounter them in the rural
counties.
So, Mr. Sherberson of Santa
Cortes, uh, 222 answers to that
first, you know, it's been my
experience that
Uh, we have hunters and anglers
and wildlife enthusiasts, uh, in
urban areas, as well as in rural
areas. So the majority, I
believe the majority of the
hunting licenses are sold to
people in Burnleyo County, uh,
and that's not surprising
because there's a lot of people
in Broo County, so we do have
interest in wildlife and hunting
and fishing in both urban and
rural communities. Um, and the
second point, uh, again, I've
lost the second point, uh, I
could ask it again if it helps.
Mr. Chair Chairman. So under
this bill, could we end up with
a game commission, whose members
don't live near the wildlife or
the citizens who encounter them
in the rural counties. Um, so
the direct to that question is
shares in San Cortez is now. I,
I have no no expectation of that
happening.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, Chairman.
Um, I do have some questions
about the fee schedule that are
located in section 9 and SB 5.
So Mr. Chair Chairman, Senator,
and experts, how many years has
it been since the department was
able to update its license fees,
Mr. Chairs and secrets, um, I
think we're just short of 20
years.
Mr. Chair, Chairman, what
percentage of department
revenues come from the
collection of these license
fees.
Mr. Chair Representative, I
believe approximately 97% of the
agency's budget as a result of
these license fees and federal
matching dollars. There's a 3 to
1 federal match from Pittman
Robertson and Dele Johnson
monies that are collected
federally from excise taxes on
firearms and ammunition because
the New Mexico Department of
Game and Fish is an enterprise
agency. It relies heavily on
license speed dollars for its
annual funding.
And
Mr. Jason, if I may add. That's
also why we've added additional
sources of funding, you know,
through this process.
Excellent. Thank you, Mr. Chair,
Chairman, expert, so does this
bill proposed to raise all
license fees for both the
residents and the non-residents.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative
Cortez, the license fees begin
on page 20 of the amendment, uh,
many erased, some are not.
And Mr. Chair Chairman.
How was that amount of the
increase, how is that determined
for each license?
Uh, Mr. Chairs there my
understanding is there was a
robust process in past years
where those fees, uh, they
looked at uh the where the fees
were and where they were in
other states, and we tried to
say true to those decisions, uh,
Mr. Debell.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
that's a fantastic question.
We've been working on this for a
couple of years. The New Mexico
Wildlife Federation and other
organizations representing the
licensed buyers of the state,
convened a working group,
included the New Mexico Council
of Outfitters and Guides who
focus primarily on non-resident
license fees. We involve Trout
Unlimited that focused primarily
on the fishing license fees, the
Mule deer Foundation worked on
the deer hunting license fees in
New Mexico Wildlife Federation
and backcountry hunters and
anglers worked on the resident
license fee.
And so as a result of all of
that work in that collaboration,
that's how the fee schedule
we're looking at today was
established, and I should also
note that the resident fees as
Chairman McQueen said, all of
them are not adjusted, but those
that are average $10 to $15 per
license. So it's a very minimal
impact on the residents of New
Mexico who depend on hunting and
fishing to feed their families.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, Chairman
expert. Was it a consistent
increase across the board?
Mr. Chair Representative, not
exactly. Some fees started off
lower than what they probably
should have been. So those
speeds might have seen a larger
increase. Others were already
slightly higher than where,
where they might have, um, what,
what might have been ideal and
so those might not have been
adjusted at all, but as a
working group, we also analyze
license costs to residents and
non-residents all across the
west to ensure that our
structure was consistent with
other Western states.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, Chairman
and expert. So, I have another
question. The Senate raised the
non-resident license fee on the
Bighorn sheep from $3150 to
$9000. Does that sound correct?
Um, Mr. Jean Cortez, uh, that is
correct. Uh, the initial
proposal in the Senate was
$15,000 and as we discussed
earlier in the amendment, we've
brought that back down to 3500.
Oh, it was amended? Oh,
wonderful. OK. Well, I believe
that concludes my question.
Thank you so much, Mr. Chair,
Chairman, Senator, and experts.
Great, thank you very much
Representative Senator Cortez.
Next is Representative Montoya.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, uh,
Chairman McQueen, um,
This bill is better.
Then years passed.
Um, I think, uh, the license
fees are that's been needed to
be addressed for a while.
Um, Obviously, the board
changes.
That's been the biggest scrape
about uh uh game and fish is how
um
From year to year or from
Uh, really at the whim of any
governor.
Um, a board can change.
Um
The process seems
Like a pretty long process.
Uh, I mean, we don't have that,
obviously, we don't have that
same uh process to that degree
even for boards of Regents, and
recent history might show.
Um, but, uh, that being said, I,
I, I like those portions of the
bill.
Um
I, I'm wondering though with a
quorum.
And having uh this.
It kind of expanded, uh, board
where you can have, do you think
that'll help or hurt?
Uh, the ability to get a form.
Um, Mrs in Montoya, uh, thank
you for those comments, you
know, I'll say 11 of the big
improvements, I think in this
bill over the one that was
pocket veto, the game
commissions, the stand-alone
game commission bill, is the
nominating committee.
Um
In the bill that was pocket
Vito, I was trying to diversify
the appointments and
What I realized in the process
was, uh, I was trying to take
politics out of the appointment
and I was just, just sort of
rearranging the politics. I
wasn't really taking it out. And
so I think the nominating
committee um is a, is a strong
step forward in terms of
vetting candidates and then uh
the governor picks from that
list.
Um, in terms of the of the
making a quorum, there there are
4 advisory members, they would
not be counted towards the war.
They're just advisory, um, you
know, the hope is increased
communication across agencies,
you would still have um 7,
7-member commission, uh, you
would have 6 year terms, you
would have only removal for
cause.
And the hope is that or really
the expectation is that, you
know, once you have some
protections for the
commissioners.
That serving on the commission
becomes more appealing, you
know, that we have more
applicants and we have people
who um really sort of get into
the job and, you know, less
turnover as a result.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, uh,
Chairman McQueen, um, I
Like I said, I think this is a
better bill than in the past,
but I, I, I, I believe the
biggest
Deficit in this bill since um
since we are going in and
Uh, changing fairly
dramatically, the mission.
of the uh current uh
Uh, fishing wildlife commission
or game commission.
I
Taking on something completely
different, which is the
management of all species.
And because of that,
I don't believe enough farmers
and ranchers.
Or on
Are, are prescribed in this. And
if this were to go forward, um,
I, I'd like to have a discussion
with you about that. I, I, the
composition of the board, I
think it's better than it was,
but the reality is decisions
that what was generally just
about managing uh uh
Sportsman.
I mean really, fish and wild of
the game of fish was really
about managing people, not
managing animals.
So this is, this is quite a bit
of a change because now we're
talking about managing wildlife.
That is going to greatly affect
People have nothing to do.
With, uh, currently with Game
and Fish.
Um, and, and Mr. Chair and Chair
McQueen.
Where I see where we've already
affected.
Private landowners and folks who
who uh raise livestock.
is just how we've treated over
the past several years, uh, uh,
how we handle coyotes.
And then now how we are handling
uh the Mexican gray wolf.
That that
Both of those have affected
greatly.
People in agriculture who who
raise livestock.
I, I believe that's the major
deficit here.
I, I think they are completely
underrepresented considering how
decisions that will be made.
By this group.
will affect them and and I I
don't see any real recourse.
We've made these changes.
Um, and, and, and, and, and
restricted.
How we handle uh the, the, the
coyote population which has
gotten a little bit out of
control, and now the Mexican
gray wolf, uh, there's no
recourse, um, for people who
have
Uh, elk that come onto their
property. There's there's,
there's a way for them to come
to the state and and and
And petition.
I
Based on that, but this, this
does not allow for that. Um,
could you please address
Those concerns for me, Mr.
Chair. Mr. Chair and I tell you,
so, um, the, the acquisition is,
is one of the few positions that
exist in current law, uh, and,
and then the current came
commission, we have this, um,
you know, these, there's some at
large positions, the groups of
counties, uh, there's supposed
to be at least one farmer or
rancher and one,
Uh, conservationist type
position. Uh, it's been a little
vague in the past when, when
governors make appointments,
who's filling what seat, uh, but
we did carry forward that, that
acquisition, you know, again,
that's a minimum, not the
maximum. Uh, there's, there's no
reason why the at large
positions or, you know, the
scientists or the
conservationists, you know, or
any of the positions could also
be uh agricultural people, uh,
because we have, you know,
agricultural people obviously,
you know, throughout our
communities and throughout our
uh
Uh, you know, ways of life in
New Mexico, um, and then,
And we also added the advisory
position of New Mexico
Department of Agriculture, and
that was sort of, I think that
was the first request. Um, I
think at the farm bureau
actually uh asked for that, and
that made a lot of sense to me.
I was thinking about that and
we, we took that idea and we
expanded on that to also include
uh Indian Affairs State Land
Office, um, and outdoor
recreation, uh, you know, and I,
I think that's, uh, that will
make for good communication and
good discussion.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and and
and Chairman McQueen. I, I, I
believe.
As I was listening to uh the
folks uh who are presenting, uh,
who were commenting today. It
seems like uh it's agriculture.
In particular, that's against
this. Yeah, I've I've heard from
anglers in support heard uh from
from uh
Obviously those who are wanting
to see uh this greatly expanded.
Uh, ability to manage.
all species, right.
Whether or not they're in danger
or not.
Um
So I can see conservationists
being on board, I could see uh
folks who are maybe in the
industry.
Of, uh, of, uh,
In the business of tourism and
dealing with the anglers and
hunters.
But the majority of the of the
Opposition that I heard, and
that has reached out to me.
are private landowners, and
folks who raise raise livestock.
Um, so I, I would say if you're,
if you're, if you're listening.
to opposition and listening to
concerns, you need to listen in
my mind to the people who are
raised in the greatest concerns,
and I think there's, um, and
because in, in my mind that's
the 2nd largest industry we have
in New Mexico is is agriculture.
Um, I'm having a hard time with
Seeing this major change.
Um, I think, I think I the the
folks, like I said, that I have
heard from the most.
Are those are concerned about,
they have no recourse.
Um, and that has proven out, I
believe, in the way we've
handled.
Uh, the coyote population and
how we've handled the, the
Mexican wolf population. So, um,
I, I appreciate this. I do
believe this is better.
Then
Before
But in my mind, until we address
the folks who have
Great financial investment.
And uh they, they ranches and in
raising livestock. I, I just
can't support this, uh, once
again, I appreciate the way this
bill has evolved, but I just
don't think it's quite there
yet. If we could
If there's, if there, if this is
gonna go on the final passage if
that's how this is gonna work
out.
Um, you can see the folks who
have stood in opposition all
along the way through the Senate
to what you're hearing today.
I would, I would ask.
That more attention be given to
private.
Landowners and those who have,
who are raising livestock. I
think if, if you could get
To that point
Uh, and then you would truly
have a compromise bill that
respects every New Mexican who
has interest in this bill today.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you.
OK, uh, next, we're gonna go to
uh Representative Dixon and then
Representative Murphy.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um,
Thank
you, um.
Chair McQueen and uh Senator,
um,
This is uh not my area of
expertise, so I'm gonna ask you
a couple questions about um sort
of the
Shift in scope for the
department, um, and what that uh
would entail.
Um
Mr. Chair, um, and
McQueen chairman. Um, can you
Explain to me what is the
difference um in federal and
state.
Protection, so, um,
Who decides what species are
determined to be endangered and
what is the uh
In layman's terms, what does,
uh,
The greatest conservation need.
Me.
Uh, Mr. Terry Rosam Dixon, so in
general, uh, the federalangered
Species Act is what deals with
endangered, threatened and
endangered species. That's,
that's entirely a creature.
of federal law, um, the species,
the greatest conservation need
is uh um something we do here in
the state. I would like to turn
this over to uh Ms. Coleman. She
can expand on that.
Good morning, Mr. Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Judy Calman. I'm the New
Mexico policy director for
Audubon Southwest. We work to
help birds in the places that
birds need, and I do just want
to acknowledge that we work
regularly with private
landowners on conservation and
recognize that that's a crucial
part of bird habitat, um, and
thank you for your question,
Representative Dixon. It's a
good one. I think there's been
some confusion about this during
the discussion of this bill.
Is this too echoey? Is it OK?
OK.
Sorry, um, so, as Chairman
McQueen said the federal
government does have an
endangered species act where
they list endangered species. I
think that's what people
automatically think of when they
think of endangered species when
things are listed on the federal
list, the federal government
does have a wide variety of
things that they can do to
protect that species, including
designating critical habitat,
impacting permits, I think, you
know, that's a lot of things
that people are worried about
when they hear about federal
list.
I know Representative Montoya
mentioned the Mexican gray wolf,
that is a federally listed
species under the purview of
Fish and Wildlife Service. It's
not directly under the curfew of
the state game and fish
department. Um, I do want to
note that even for endangered
species, the game and fish
department at the state level
does not have the same powers
that the federal government has,
so they do not have the power to
designate critical habitat or to
impact permits, all they have
the power to do is do habitat
restoration projects and
regulate.
First species that they've
listed on the, the state list of
species. So I think it's
important to note that those
powers are very, very different
at the federal and state level,
um, on the SGCM list, the
species of greatest conservation
need list. That is the list that
the state department puts
together every 10 years and it's
a list of declining species in
New Mexico that are not yet um
so bad that they're listed on
the federal list, so it's a list
of species that the department
is paying attention to. It's
not the same as endangered
species, but it's a list of the
species that need attention.
Again, even for the species on
the SGCN list, the game and fish
department does not have
authority to impact permits to
do anything specific, but it's
the species list that they're
watching that's in decline.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, thank
you, chair, and um Miss Calman,
um, in section 5, the new
section, um, you know, new
material that's being added, um.
I'd like a little bit more
clarification on a couple of
phrases.
So
First, and I don't have the, the
line, but um 5A defined as
protected.
So that's one phrase that I'd
like a little bit more um
information on and then um also
Mr. Cha, chair.
Management and protection by
rule. Um, if you could elaborate
on exactly what those mean and
entail.
Um, men chairs in Dixon, so I'm
looking at page 9 and 10, there,
there are no line numbers on the
amendment or do you know exactly
where those that language
appears. Sorry, Mr. Chair and
Chair, on section 5A, um, 0, it
is page 9,
Halfway down.
In the new material, so 5A is in
addition to species defined as
protected?
OK. Thank you. I found it, uh,
I'm gonna let um Malma answer
that question as well.
Mr. Chair and Representative
Dixon, I'm sorry, one second.
Um, so protection in that
context is defined in statute
already, and this bill does not
change any authority that game
and fish already has, and so
again, they don't have, you
know, authority to do the same
things that the federal
government does. They only have
authority to regulate take of
protected species monitor
protected species and do habitat
restoration projects for those
species, so that would stay the
same.
And if I could, I just wanna
also note that the importance of
the SGCN list is to ensure that
our species in decline in New
Mexico do not get listed on the
federal list, and so we know
that good state management here
actually can prevent those
listings, which everyone wants
to avoid.
Me and um Jackson, if I can add
to that, you know, avoiding
listing under the dangered
Species Act is really a goal,
because once a species is
listed.
Uh, management of that species
is much more restrictive.
Uh, so that's something we want
our department to to do and
participate in, uh, under the
Martinez administration, uh, we
withdrew from uh Mexican gray
wolf management.
And that didn't change.
Outcome, what it did was it it
denied us a seat at the table.
It denied us a voice, you know,
this is our agency where we have
this expertise. We want them
involved in these issues,
working on behalf of New Mexico
and again so we can avoid these
federal listenings.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
chair. So,
Just to make sure I'm following,
so defined as protected, um,
that phrase to the protected is
already defined in stature, so
we are not changing what
qualifies as protected.
And then
Extend management and protection
by rule, uh, Mr. Chair, chair,
that
Essentially is uh takings
monitoring and habitat
restoration. Am I correct?
Ma'am, uh, Mister Chair
and Dixon, um, so again this is
that sort of authority and
discretion that I talked about.
You know, there are certain
species that are already
specified in the rule, and we're
not changing this, you know,
we're giving the um the agency,
the authority, the commission
authority to work on other
species, but the discretion to
Uh, decide which species to work
on.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Chair. So, um, other species,
that's another area of question
that I had, uh, which is, you
know, as we're talking about
changing the department from
Game and Fish to wildlife. Um, I
was
Intrigued by uh some of the
definitions of what is included.
Um, and I apologize. I, oh, here
we go. OK, on page 10, uh, Mr.
Chair Chair, um,
5D, so section 5, subsection D.
Um, as used in this section,
wildlife means a non-domestic
mammal bird reptile amphibian
fish, which I, I follow, um, but
then I'd like some clarification
on why we're including
invertebrate species.
And then, yeah, we could start
there and then I'll, I have
another question.
So Mr. Chair, I might let um uh
this comment chime in on this,
but, you know, the way I look at
this is, um,
Again, this is the agency where
we have the expertise.
Um, so if, for example, there
was an endangered butterfly.
You know, that are the
Declining, there's the word
declining butterfly that was
present in New Mexico and I, you
know, I, I can remember um
there's butterflies in different
places. I don't know if there
are any, but um,
Uh
We would want our agency
involved in management of that
species in order to help avoid
listening under the Endangered
Species Act.
And that's why we include things
like invertebrates.
Did you want anything that
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
chair. And so,
With the butterfly in that.
Case, um, if
The Department of Wildlife were
to decide that it's a species in
need in
decline.
Then
What would the department be
allowed to do to protect, said.
Butterfly.
So Mr. Chair, Dixon, uh, what
the department cannot do is
designate critical have done.
Um, so that's, that's
significant, and that's the
power that the feds have under
the Federal Endangered Species
Act.
Um, Ms. Cole, anything to add to
that?
Mhm
Thank you, Mr. Chair and
Representative Dickson, so
Yes, so their power under the
species of greatest conservation
need list or the state
endangered list is the same. So
all the department can do is do
habitat management projects,
restoration, and regulate takes.
So in this bill, you know, the
department already does a lot of
non-game work, and they focused
that non-game work on the SGCN
list and we're reinforcing that
in this bill. So yes, we're
saying that they can work on any
species, but they also have to
focus.
On the SGCN list and show a need
for working on that species,
which really would mean that
that species is in decline.
Right now there's no insects on
the SGCN list that might change
if as an invertebrate species
went on it, their powers would
remain the same to just manage
that species as best they can
and regulate take if they needed
to. But that tape regulation
would not apply to things like
industry permits. They don't
have what the feds have. The
feds have an incidental take
permit where they can just say,
by building this whatever
project you might impact this
many.
Listed species and therefore,
you're taking them. That's not
what the game and fish
department can do. They can only
regulate direct take from
individuals.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
chair, and uh expert and so, in
other words,
If a wind farm was going up in
an area that let's say,
Um, is in the migratory path of
A declining butterfly species.
The state could not prevent.
That wind farm, only the federal
government.
Is that correct?
Chair and Representative Dixon,
that's correct. So if it was a
federally listed species, there
could be impacts to that permit.
If it's a state listed species
or a species that game and fish
decided to protect under this
bill, game and fish could not
impact that wind farm.
Thank you, Mr. Terry. Thank you.
Um, I really appreciate this
clarification, as I mentioned,
this is not my um area of
expertise. Um, let me see.
Oh,
Mr. Chair and Chairman.
Continuing in that sentence, I
was also um
It was unclear to me, and if I
could get some explanation of
why we're including
Including a living animal or any
part egg spawn offspring or the
dead body or parts thereof.
Thank you.
Um
Mr. Terry resumed Dixon, so, uh,
first off, we believe this is
current statute that it's been
relocated and that's why it's
shown as new material. Um, but
also, you know, there's a
wildlife trafficking, um, you
know, includes parts, right? And
that's, you know, part of what
we ask our, our department to,
to do to enforce, um, you know,
not, not only do they have
jurisdiction over things like
poaching, but also um the
marketing of, of, of animal.
Um, pieces, um, you know, once
they happen, um poached.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Chairman. So antlers.
would be an example.
Uh, Mr. Chair, representation,
uh, sheds, yes, although we did
as, as we mentioned, we added uh
some shed provisions. Uh, we
think the department had the
authority to regulate that, uh,
being with those amendments came
in over in the Senate.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, thank
you, chair.
I believe that
Those questions, um,
have cleared up some confusion
for me at this time. Thank you.
Thank you very much Dixon. Next
is Ran Murphy.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, uh,
Representative, I'll try to make
this quick. Um, I know we've got
a lot more to do today. Um, I'm
an avid hunter and fisherman.
And I want to start off by, by
acknowledging how professional
my interactions have been with
game and fish department over
the years and what a great job I
think they're doing. And so, uh,
with that said though, I'll have
to say this too is as if I just
put on my angler hat, my hunting
hat. I'm not sure how I feel
about this bill, and I've got to
think about that a little bit,
but it, but it does areas of the
vastly concerned me.
Um, and I echoing uh
Representative Montoya's
remarks, um, the people in
agriculture, um, in my area and
I, I come from generally rural
area, um, uh, are very concerned
about it.
And so my first question is, um,
If you, if you just make
If you, if you approach the bill
where, where the power, and I
won't talk about this in just a
minute, the legislature's not
being diluted and you're not
expanding the scope. If you only
focused on the board and the fee
changes which there seems to be
pretty universal um agreement
that those need to be done. This
would be a fairly
noncontroversial bill. And I'm
wondering why, um, what, why you
took the approach and added
those other two elements in, in,
in 11 bill.
Um, I'm, I'm sorry, uh, Ms.
Roseanne Mercy, which are the
two elements that you think are,
oh, the, the transfer from the
legislature to the commission on
the Species.
Um, expanding it.
And let me explain that a little
bit. Section 16 list.
Game animals.
Game birds and game fish. These
are all, um, species, families,
genesis that are manageable by
the commission.
There are 10 to 12 under each of
those, and they are, you know,
some expansive, some more
specific.
Um
So it's, it's the expansion of
that to all species. Um, when I
talk about the expansion of
scope. So those four elements
board and fee changes, easy.
Transfer of power a little
harder.
And then expansion of scope.
Pretty problematic.
Um
Miss Sher Rosette Murphy.
Uh, I, I, I'm trying to answer
your question uh to sort of a
lot in there. Um,
Part of, to me, part of what
this bill is, is an
acknowledgement that the
expertise on these issues is
housed in this agency.
Uh, so if there was
A species in decline.
That that we needed them to be
involved in. If we had to wait
for legislative action.
And hope that that could get
through the legislature.
You know, that's not, um,
I mean, you know how you've been
here long enough, you know how
this place works, right? Um,
like, cause I, I think even if
it's a crash course, right?
It's, it's hard. Uh, so like if,
if it came up that
You know, the
West Mesa spotted butterfly I'm
making that up, by the way, um,
you know, was in decline, you
know, I mean, at what point
would the agency be able to
respond? I mean, it might be a
matter of years.
And that, I don't think that's a
good thing. Um, so, so because
we, we have, um, hardworking,
conscientious state employees
we're gonna vest them with this
authority, um, under the
supervision of the revised game
commission and I understand Mr.
Dubell would like to.
Uh, probably clarify my answer.
Uh, Mr. Chair, Representative,
thank you very much for the
question. I'd, I'd like to start
by mentioning that the North
American model of wildlife
conservation, which is the model
that's pretty closely followed
by our state wildlife agency as
well as every state wildlife
agency across the country is the
most successful model of
wildlife management that exists
anywhere on the planet. Now
there are 7 specific tenants in
the North American model. One of
the tenets that this bill does a
fantastic job of addressing is
the tenant that
It says wildlife management
should be based on science, and
that's the reason we're
depoliticizing the the
Department of Game and Fish, and
I should mention the new
Department of Game and fish soon
to hopefully be the New Mexico
Department of Wildlife is our
state's only wildlife agency. We
don't have another one. There's
not one for game species and one
for non-game species and one for
species of greatest conservation
need. We've got one agency. So
we need them to do all the work,
we need them to be properly
resourced and we need their
authority to be clarified, as
has been mentioned.
We're not asking them to do
more. They're already doing work
on species of greatest
conservation needed many
non-game species and this is
something that the hunting
community is overwhelmingly
supportive of. 40 days from
today, we're gonna have the
opening of spring turkey season.
That's like a holiday for me,
uh, it's an unbelievably
important day in my life, the
opening of spring turkey season.
Any turkey hunter knows that the
1st 6 weeks of a pot's life, it
relies almost exclusively on
insects for survival.
So as a hunter, I'm very
enthusiastic about the portion
of this bill that ensures the
departments could be managing
all of these critical wildlife
species to ensure that we have
healthy intact ecosystems. Thank
you.
Mr. Chair and and representative
expert, um, regarding the timing
issue, uh, and I have been here
long enough to get at least a
little sense of how this place
works and so, um,
I, I would point out is that
there are things that happen
between the legislative session,
uh, Mr. Chairman and
Representative, there's interim
committees where a lot of work
can be done, uh, if there's a
true emergency, my
understanding, and I don't
pretend to know about all of
their authority, but I know that
the finance Authority, um, is,
you know, always in place to
address it many types of
emergencies and so it might take
a year, it might even take 2.
Hopefully wouldn't, but um with
that statement, um, I just
challenged the, the, that
there's no sort of
Alternative, right? Um, to lead
to lead into the commission
because I think there are
legislative mechanisms that um
that could perhaps address it.
The last one is, is this last
question is my last question,
and it is, um, Mr. Chairman and
Representative, you were looking
for a mate in a show, I may have
found it.
And you can tell me if I have or
not, it's down under.
5B just uh below the.
58 were uh Representative Dixon
was talking about and it says a
species of wildlife, the
commission shall consider. Now,
throughout this document, it
says it typically uses May.
And I'm wondering if you can
tell me why the difference here,
what you're, what you're trying
to accomplish in it concerns me
a little bit when we talk about
flexibility and then we in
certain sections, um, sort of
ignore that flexibility. So, Mr.
Chairman, Mr. Represent uh
representative um the Queen.
Um, Mr. Charis Murphy, so, so
one of the downsides of
combining all the amendments in
one document and you sort of
lose the that history, you know,
the iteration of the bill. Uh,
so I, you know, there was this
issue of there was a request to
change Xiao to May, we agreed
and there literally was, you
know, some discussion after
that, after the committee
hearing that we changed the
wrong child to me and so we fix
that. Um, I, I will say I'm not
finding the language you're
talking about, but I, I will say
when you
When the language says shall
consider.
You know, that's still fairly
open ended. You're gonna
consider it.
You know, and I think
considering, um, you know, the
science, you know, the
economics, the different aspects
of these issues is important,
so, um, uh, I, I, I, I mean, I'm
pretty comfortable with where
the bill is now. I, I have a
missed Coleman going to add to
my answer.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and
Representative. I just wanted to
add that this particular she
requires that the commission um
consider certain things before
deciding to protect the species.
So it's actually a little bit
constraining the commission, I
think, by requiring them to
consider certain things before
protection.
Thank you for that explanation,
uh, Mr. Chairman and, and
Representative all just conclude
there. Thank you. Thank you very
much for Murphy. Next, we're
gonna go to Garcia, then
represent Henry.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Chairman, uh.
And thank you.
than Senator.
For bringing this legislation
forward.
Um,
couldn't empathize with your
8-year mission.
I had a lot of information that
that took me 8 years, 10 years,
12 years to really get through,
so I kind of really, you know,
I'm a fan of of uh.
Fellow colleagues that kind of
go through that enduring
process, um.
Mr. Chair, um,
You know, uh, representative,
uh, Senator Cortez mentioned
what were some of the problems?
And uh and naturally you've
addressed.
One problem that I saw as major,
which was basically
Uh, Malthusians, Malphicians of
uh of government.
And that was this whole notion
of kind of packing.
commission with one political
party.
Um
Uh, and in regards to uh
Potential candidates of
Uh, for the commission.
Changing the party affiliation.
And actually, that was not a
long process, Mr. Chair. It was
basically a process of collusion
between the executive and the
potential candidate.
And uh um
And you kind of address that,
uh, you know.
Item H, page 5.
But I want you to kind of
elaborate on the exemption.
We do have an exemption to that
4-year period, uh,
Or a candidate that has 0 party
affiliation in the four-year
period cannot qualify as a.
As a commissioner.
Um, but you do have an
exemption. If you could
elaborate on what that exemption
is.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Repent Garcia. So looking at
section 8 at the bottom of page
5,
you're exactly right. Um, you
know, there, there were certain
there were instances in the
past, uh, in various, uh, you
know, boards and commissions,
oh, you know, I need a Democrat
on this um commission, why don't
you become a Democrat and I'll
appoint you, you know.
So to address that, we have a
4-year lookback period that you
can't have changed your party
affiliation within the past 4
years in order to, you know, be
considered a member of that
party.
But we do have in state law
this, this, uh it goes to the
open primary issue, um, and, uh,
declined state voter or a member
of a minor party can show up on
election day, uh, in both, and
the way they do that is they're
effectively using the same day
registration, uh, uh, process
that we've put in place, so they
decided to become a Democrat or
a Republican or I think the
libertarians are also a major
party, um, and they vote in that
primary election.
And then they have the
opportunity to change back.
And so what this exception to
the 4-year lookback period is
that if you are a GTS voter and
you did change your party in
order to vote, uh, in, in a
primary?
That we're not gonna hold that
against you. You, we're still,
you, you, if you change your
registration back to what it
was, you would still be
considered a DTS voter.
OK, thank you for that, uh, Mr.
Chair and Representative.
Um
That was very clarifying.
I think very proper.
Uh considering the conditions.
Um,
Also, Mister Chair, um,
You know, I really appreciate
the
The indexing that you.
kind of applied to um.
fees.
Uh, I feel
You know, um, we should do that
with.
All aspects of of government
regarding.
You know, um,
bees.
etc.
Uh, it's, it's only right and
proper.
That, um
That the fees of whatever were
being imposed on.
Kind of keep track with um.
With inflation.
So I think that's very
commendable.
Um, another important, um,
issue that I wanted to address
in
That the legislation before us
does kind of a
Um, modernizes.
You know, the
the doings of the
A commission, wildlife
commission.
And in that, um,
I only see one portion of the
legislation
of item C, page 9.
That kind of deals with
The concern that I had
historically regarding these um
Heritage destroying fires.
Like the Ca cannon from its
peak.
You know, it just wasn't a
typical.
Wildfire
Wildfire, Mr. Chair, that just
turned to ashes, the greenery.
You know, the grasses, the pine
trees, the pin and whatever.
But it kind of really uh
inflicted devastating damage.
Uh
On a heritage or cultural
heritage.
of a native population in that
area.
And actually wildlife was
affected dramatically, Mr.
Chair.
Um
Because of that.
Um
And I want to see how
This modernization of
The wildlife department.
How
In this legislation.
They're kind of
Uh, obligated to maybe look at.
Immediate emergency response.
To what is existing on the
ground.
And what that would look like.
Based on
The language that you have in
the bill before us.
Um
Keeping in mind, say.
What happened with the Cafan and
hermit peak.
You know, and um,
Um
And how does your legislation
kind of elevate.
Intervention of the wildlife
department.
In terms of really addressing.
What is happening not only with
wildlife.
But also with property
management.
Other people devastated.
But
heritage destroying fires,
Mister Chair.
So, um,
Mr. Chair and Garcia, Senator
Compass is gonna chime in here,
but yeah, just like say.
Where you're talking about the
sort of healthy force. Uh, we
need healthy forest. Our forests
are not healthy right now, and
healthy forests are good for
wildfire prevention.
Uh, they're good for wildlife.
And they're good for grazing.
Yeah, so these are all things
like as we work to restore
health to our forests, um.
I think there's, there's a, a
role for the Department of Game
and Fisher, the Department of
Wildlife, the play, you know,
we, we don't really ask them to
go out there and, you know, thin
forest or do work like that. Uh,
that's not the role of this
agency, uh, but it is, is one of
these things that as we restore
the health to our forests, there
are, there is a multiplicity of
benefits, uh, including to fire
prevention, including the
wildlife including the
agriculture.
Thank you very much, uh, Mr.
Chairman, of course, uh
Representative Garcia.
It's a point well taken for a
couple of reasons. First of all,
as we saw the uh huge
devastation and of course, if
you will, a rebuilding and we
lost so many of the trees and
we're trying to figure out.
As we go forward, how the
habitat is definitely going to
change, and of course we have
the ground cover and we're
dealing with those issues as we
take a look at the heritage of
the area.
Uh, that's gonna transform, as
we know, because the individuals
that have been there for
generations.
Now are figuring out, well, what
are we going to leave to our
children? How are we going to
continue, if you will, with the
wildlife that is in the area.
The game and fish department
have been uh very supportive and
cooperative in helping to keep,
if you will, herds in areas
where they can survive, but at
the same time in the rebuilding
as we move forward, it is gonna
take a lot of work and with the
modernization as you indicate,
uh, with this.
particular department if this
was to pass and this was to
occur.
the resources in order to go
ahead and fundamentally focus in
on the heritage and if you will,
the preservation of uh of
course, what's left after what
has been uh destroyed. So, uh,
we have a long road ahead of us,
uh, but you do bring up a very
good point. This is going to be
something that is integral uh if
this bill was to pass for us to
go ahead and make additional
changes to hold on to the
heritage la.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Thank you.
University. Thank you, Mr. Chair
and thank you, Senator and
Representative.
I'm really elaborating.
On that real important aspect
that I.
near and dear to my heart.
Uh, lastly, Mr. Chair, on item
G.
H5 um.
All right.
Damon fish commissioner is
subject to a.
The, um
State at the commission.
processed currently.
If they are
What does, what in your
legislation kind of highlights.
Um
For
promotes
that process.
Um, Mr. Chair, Representative
Garcia, so you're referring to
the removal provision in on page
5, section G, um, and we, we
actually, um,
We did a lot of work on this,
uh, we originally had, uh, the
removal, um, having uh original
jurisdiction in the US and in
the state Supreme Court.
Uh, it was brought to our, our,
our attention by the ethics
commission, that that was an
expansion of the state Supreme
Court jurisdiction by statute,
which we can't do. Uh, that has
to be a constitutional
amendment.
Uh, and so we had to go back to
district court. Uh, we, we
consulted with the ethics
commission and we included them
here, uh, because we didn't want
a situation, a situation where
commissioners could be harassed,
uh, either by, uh, elected
officials or members of the
public that like they, they
voted uh took a decision that
was not uh popular and, you
know, someone will allege that
that that was malfeasance. And
so what, what this said that
To do is use the ethics
commission as sort of a filter.
So if you have a complaint, you
can file it with the ethics
commission, and they think it
has merit, then they are the
ones who would uh proceed at
district court, so it's not just
uh anyone off the street.
Uh, and we consulted with us
ethics commission and they're
comfortable with that role.
Well thank you for that, Mr.
Chair and thank you for that
addition.
Those are all my questions, Mr.
Chair. Thank you, Senator. Thank
you, Representative. Great,
thank you very much
Representator Garcia,
Representative Henry. Thank you,
Mr. Chair, Mr. Chair, Senator
Dern, and experts. I've got two
really quick questions,
hopefully, uh, the first one is
when you were mentioning earlier
that the department has the.
Option to do habitat
restoration. What does that
consist of?
I, I think you were addressing
that to our expert, is that
correct? Rosan Hendricks?
Whoever, whoever feels best to
answer, but yeah, the expert uh
is the one that talked the most
about it, so she would like to
answer. Yeah, thank you, Mr.
Chair and Representative Henry,
I think the department's also
here and they might answer that
question better than me, but um
they do all kinds of habitat
restoration work that can be
riparian area a restoration, um,
you know, monitoring of species.
I, you know, I, I don't wanna
speak for them. I don't actually
have that much experience with
what they are doing right now,
but um they do have that.
ration work all over the state
for their listed endangered
species and for SGCN species
when they have the funding for
it. So, Mr. Chair, Mr. Chair,
and Senator, if, if, is there,
is there any fence out? Is that,
could that possibly be part of
restoration.
Uh, Mr. Chair, Representative,
thank you for the wonderful
question. Uh, exclosures are one
type of habitat project that
certainly can happen. Similarly
to how sportsmen today are
enthusiastic about paying higher
hunting and fishing license fees
to support the department back
in 2021, the hunters and anglers
of New Mexico banded together
and encouraged our state game
commission to double the price
of our habitat improvement fee.
It started in 1984, it used to
be $5. We asked to make it $10.
so that the agency would have
more funding, more resources to
do habitat projects all across
federally managed public lands.
So some of those projects
include the removal of
unnecessary fencing, exclosures
are one thing that can be done.
Also, we spend a lot of time
because of the devastating
droughts that we're experiencing
doing water infrastructure,
putting in guzzlers, water
catchment systems, things like
that.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, Mr. Chair.
The reason for the question is
if I have a grazing lease and I
have water on it, uh, and we've
decided that through this piece
of legislation which we've added
a whole bunch of new species if
we're concerned of, uh, I'm not
gonna say a mouse because I
think that'll bring up a lot of
uh of heart issues, um, but
let's say a mouse. um
are all of a sudden is that
watering source possibly gonna
be fenced out, which would
drastically.
my grazing lease. Is that part
of, could that be something that
is considered restoration.
Or
Habitat restoration to improve
the, the bug, the mouse, the
What we've grown to Mr. Chair
Representative, I don't think
that threat exists at a state
level, but I certainly believe
if we allow some of these
species in decline to be added
to the federal endangered
species list, then that risk is
very real, and the risk to our
landowners who I, I'd like to
mention provide critical habitat
for wildlife all across the
state. I primarily hunt on
public land, but recognize the
invaluable contributions our
private landowners make to
wildlife and when those species
in decline get listed federally.
The impact it has on industry
and on agriculture is, is
tremendous and so I think this
bill goes a long way to ensuring
the threats that you're
mentioning will not happen. Mr.
Chair, Mr. Chair, no, I agree
with you. I definitely don't
want to be listed federally
because then it becomes a bigger
problem. My question is, is, is
we're expanding because of this
new section or not new, we're
expanding section 17-2-3, we've
already discussed that from just
the mammals, birds and fish to,
to basically include anything
that walks, it feels like, um
or flies. Uh.
If, if we see that, and we see
that in decline.
One thing I've learned from Mr.
Chairman is may and shall do
become a very big deal, which I
never knew that until uh Mr.
Chair has pointed out enough, so
thank you for teaching me that,
but that's where, when, when we
said Ma and Shell, uh,
Representative Murphy was
talking about on page 9, being
when we said, when we switched
it back to shell rather than May
underneath the sho which tells
me you will do one of these
things, whereas May means that
we're seeing a decline in a
butterfly.
Because that's another issue
that's impacted places I've
lived in, in the mountains, um.
You're going to choose from one
of those. Well, under one of
those.
And I've lost it, um.
Species,
the department,
um.
Yeah, no, I've got it. I just
completely lost the page.
The rules and management
programs that would potentially
accompany a protected status,
the farms are required.
Oh darn it, I've lost it.
Anyways, in here, I saw where it
said that you are going to
restore the habitat, and that
became a big concern to me
mainly because a big chunk of,
of the areas I represent do
either have grazing leases and
or agriculture leases, and I
want to make sure those folks
are continuing, there is no
possibility that because we've
decided to watch a species,
which I don't disagree with, so
please don't take it that way,
but I also don't want to impact
those folks because we're
worried about.
else.
Ministers of Henry, so the
department, you know, has the
authority to regulate direct and
not indirect date. So they don't
have the authority to designate
critical habitat. They don't
have the authority to mandate
fencing. They don't have the
authority to mend the the
removal of fencing. So they
really don't have a lot of
authority on private.
OK, Mr. Chair, Mr. Chair. So
that means I just wanna make
sure I'm very clear that if
somebody has a grazing lease and
we have identified a bug or, or,
or new
Animal that we, we've now
designated, that there's no way
we're going to be able to impact
that grazing.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
it's, we do have the department
here, so perhaps they could
clarify, but it's my
understanding that the, the
grazing lease that exists is
going to be between the lessee
and the Federal Land Management
Agency and the New Mexico
Department of Game and Fish and
hopefully soon to be the Mexico
Department of Wildlife does not
have the authority to negatively
interfere with that
relationship. OK, thank you for
that answer, Mr. Chair and Mr.
Chair. The only other thing I'm
gonna be very quick because I
want to get some other bills as
well as y'all do, um.
When, when we're expanding this
list, and now we're gonna add
obviously rabbits, raccoons, uh,
quite a few what I would call
nuisance y'all probably won't. I
apologize for the word, but, uh,
growing up around agriculture
and everything else sometimes
rabbits are a bit of an issue,
raccoons have become quite a bit
of an issue. Is there anything
in there that now, now that
we've added those to this
massive list, uh, that's gonna
impact any farmers or ranchers
to deal with it as their.
Negatively affecting their
agriculture, much like coyotes
to do on our uh.
Cattle industry.
cattle and she.
Mister Chairs, uh, Henry, we're
actually not adding them to the
list, you know, again, we're
giving the department the
authority to manage the species.
In the discretion to manage them
or not manage them. So we're not
mandating that they're take,
take on rabbits or gophers or
coyotes or anything like that,
um, and that, uh, you know, my
expectation was largely uh
continue as it currently does.
Mr. Chair, Mister, uh, if, but
we are sort of adding on to the
list. We're, we're adding the,
the possibility, basically
anything, as I said earlier that
walks, crawls, flies, is now.
A possible
to look at, whereas right now,
if you look at 17-2-3. It's
mammals, uh, which are all
pretty big when I was looking
through that it's the elk, it's
the deer, don't disagree. It's
the birds, which is a huge list
in fish. Um, so we, we are
adding some other smaller
rodents to this list. Is that?
The possibility of adding other
small rodents to this list. Is
that possible? Ma'am to
represent Henry, yes, we're
adding that authority again, um,
uh, Miss Coleman, you want to
add to that?
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair and
Representative Henry, I just
think it's worth clarifying
again that we're in the statute
um directing the game and fish
department to look at the
species of greatest conservation
need when thinking about
protecting a species and to be
on the species of greatest
conservation needless, that
species needs to needs to be
shown to be in serious decline
in New Mexico, so it would have
to be a species that is not, as
you say, a nuisance species of
which there are plentiful,
plentiful animals, but rather a
species of.
having a lot of trouble to go on
that list and so that's what
we're really focusing on here.
So yes, we're giving them the
authority to look at any
species, but we're also
directing them to look at
species in decline, and this
bill also doesn't take away any
powers that private landowners
currently have in statute, so
we're not taking away their
ability to shoot and kill
animals on their property.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you.
Uh, thank you very much,
Representative Henry. Uh, thank
you all. I, I have a quick, a
couple of questions and then
we'll go to Representative
Garcia, um, for the motion, uh,
Mr. Chair, Senator Campos,
experts, it seems like during
the course of this more support
from a wider variety of folks
has come together. Is that your
sense?
Uh, Mr. Chair, uh, I, I think
support has been building over
the years as, as Representative
Montoya said, I, I think the
bill gets better and it's, I
think it's very good bill at
this point. Right.
Uh, thank you, chair. Thank you,
Senator. Thank you experts. I
wanna, you know, there's a great
deal of uh sort of bipartisan
work and really cross
stakeholder work. Many times we
can see some of these similar
stakeholders, one might imagine
there are different interests,
but we heard a wide variety of
common interests here today that
are sort of unified in this
bill. Um, Mr. Chair, uh, the, I
think we got that clarity. This
doesn't, um,
Expand the state's role into any
federal jurisdiction. Those are
still very clear, Mr. Chas that,
that's your sense, Mr. Chair,
yes, and Mr. Chair, this will,
it could potentially are quite
likely keep sort of that federal
intervention from happening by
having to stay working
voluntarily with more funding
helping a wide variety of
stakeholders, uh, if private
landowners are, for instance,
interested.
interested in uh say keeping a
species from becoming federally
listed, will your bill help them
in keeping that species healthy
and not being federally listed.
Mr. Chair, yes.
Great. That's, that's really
good to hear and, and that helps
me. Oh yeah, I think it helps
illustrate why um there's a lot
of different interests that are
coming together here. Um,
The
Yeah, yeah, I think the
committee has gone through a
bunch of the questions, really
appreciate the time, but just
wanna close by, from my end and
I'll go back to you all, um,
complimenting the work that's
been done, want to thank the
senators, Senator Campos,
Senator Brantley, Senator, uh,
worth, uh, for over the course
of a number of years coming
together, noting many of our um
guides and outfitters also have
agricultural operations and
seeing sort of how the
those interests are reflected
here in this bill, which is
really impressive, uh, combined
with the extra funding that's
coming to the department and
closed by thinking the
department for helping convene a
wider set of stakeholders
building on momentum which seems
to bring us here today.
Uh, Mr. Chair, anything for you
and the senator to add before we
go to Representative Garcia.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee, and
there's been so much of the
dialogue going on today, and I
truly appreciate each and every
one of you as you have not only
pose the questions but continue
to go ahead and have the
concerns and to express, if you
will, your thoughts in terms of
what this uh particular measure
and what the department can look
like as we, uh, prepare, if you
will, uh, a new vision for, for
what this, uh, definitely can
be.
A few things just first of all,
uh, what are we really trying to
do and improve leadership.
Continue with the funds, if you
will, that are going to be
necessary to uh manage and to uh
operate the department, in fact,
I was going back and since the
90s, um I've been carrying uh
funding bills. Some have gone
through, some haven't, and that
has made it very difficult for
the department as they move
forward to continue with a
stable, uh, financing situation
in order to continue to.
hence uh the department.
This also provides, if you will,
those tools as we move forward,
and there's a few things that I
would just bring to uh to the
table as well.
Oftentimes when there's the lack
of the quorum with the uh game
commission. What happens then to
the administration, to the
concerns that have been raised
that had been placed on the
agenda.
They possibly are delayed.
When it comes to the officers
that work within the department,
when you go ahead and you see
what DPS, uh, they, they have
maybe better compensation
packages. So we have people that
have left the department so
we're trying to go ahead and
stabilize that.
As we continue to go ahead and
deal with so many of the issues,
the bottom line is we're really
trying to go ahead and improve
the ecosystem so that we can all
uh coexist. As humans, as
animals, as we continue to move
forward with all the species.
The intent, Mister Chair,
members of this committee is to
ensure that we continue to
modernize the uh eloquently
stated.
The key for each and every one
of us is if this is to pass.
This is going to be, if you
will, the future for future
generations.
to enjoy our environment, our
wildlife, and more importantly,
to help New Mexico to continue
to be one of the focus states
where people come to enjoy, but
at the same time for local
residents can continue to enjoy
the great outdoors. Thank you
very much, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
members of the committee. Thank
you, Senator, Mr. Chair, Mr.
Chair, if I may, uh, you know,
I'd like to think that the
center and, you know, all of our
sponsors. Uh, I'd like to thank
our experts you bringing here
today, the public who came out.
Um, this is a bill that
generates a lot of interest.
Uh, it, we put a lot of work
into it. I think it's a very
good bill, Mr. Chair, um, I, I
appreciate your comments a
moment ago, uh, and I appreciate
your, your expertise in this
area and your ability to bring
funding uh to this issue, you
know, because that's, that's
always been one of the
challenges, you know, as I said,
we always knew that if we were
gonna do this, we had to broaden
the scope of funding and I thank
you for doing that.
OK, thank you. Thank you all.
Uh, we'll go to Rose Garcia,
please, Mr.
Du pass recommendation on Senate
Bill 5 as twice amended.
OK, I'll second that motion. Uh,
can we go ahead and take the
role?
Representative of Beta, yes.
Representative Dixon, yes.
Representative Garcia, yes.
Representative Grola, yes.
Representative Henry, no.
Represented Montoya? No.
Representative Murphy? No.
Representative Santa Cortes? No.
Representative Small.
Christ, you know.
McQueen.
Yes.
Cape by a vote of 6 to 4. We
have a due pass on Senate Bill 5
as twice amended. Thank you, Mr.
Chair, members of the committee.
Thank you very much. I'd like to
suggest we take a 5-minute break
as we clear the room and change
seats, we do have we do have
more bills. We'll take a quick 5
minute break, see everybody back
here about 10:35, 10:38.
OK, if you could, in the
audience, if everyone could take
a seat, please.
OK, at the, uh, so that was a
long bill this morning, um,
we're not done. Uh, at the
request of the ranking leader.
Uh, ranking member, member, um,
we're gonna, uh, go to hospital
270 0 emission vehicle rules,
um, Representative Armstrong,
uh, whenever you're ready.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Chairman and
thank you committee, uh, for,
for hearing this bill. I
appreciate that. Um, um, Mr.
Chairman and members of the
committee, in November of 2023,
the Environmental Improvement
Board adopted the California
Advanced Clean Air rules for New
Mexico, which became effective
in model year 2027, which is
actually 2026.
The California Advanced Clean
Air rule requires 43% of all
vehicles available for sale in
New Mexico be zero admissions,
and the percentage increase 8%
each year until 2032.
Where the mandate will require
that 82% of all vehicles
available for sale, be it zero
admissions vehicles.
Um,
the California Clean Air rules
will limit choices for vehicles
and ultimately raise the price
of vehicles throughout New
Mexico. New Mexicans deserve the
right to purchase the vehicle of
their choice.
For their needs based on their
budget and lifestyle.
Um, the other point that I'd
like to make.
Um, to leave you with is that
these rules have been adopted.
Do not prohibit New Mexicans
from purchasing um the vehicle
of their choice in another
state.
And registering it here in New
Mexico.
This will force New Mexicans to
travel hundreds of miles to
purchase their vehicle.
Of their choice out of state
meanwhile hurting New Mexico's
small businesses. Our small
business, uh, retailer, uh, in
New Mexico is about they employ
about 15,000 New Mexico, New
Mexicans. Ultimately, Mister
Chairman, members of the
committee.
Um, this creates tribal and
rural hardships in New Mexico,
uh, imposing government mandates
instead of allowing it to be a
market-driven, uh, market driven
to determine what vehicles are
best suited for New Mexico's New
Mexicans, and limiting choices
and increasing costs to New
Mexicans.
The New Mexico, New Mexicans in
rural and tribal areas in New
Mexico have often have to often
drive hours to their jobs,
schools, medical appointments,
however, these areas are notably
lower rate of EV charging
stations and in the areas in New
Mexico that do not have
electricity in their homes or
businesses. Uh, Mr. Chairman and
members of the committee with me
is Carlos Garcia, and um Ken
Ortiz, and if they would like to
add anything, um,
That, uh, there was also Mr.
Chairman's, uh, some things
passed out to you. I appreciate
that and I would let them add
anything.
OK, Mister Chairman, with that
we stand for questions.
OK, thank you for that, uh, just
by show of hands, who is here in
support of this bill?
You see one, who's here in
opposition to this bill? OK. So,
uh, it's generally our, our
custom, we do, we do transport,
3 in opposition, and we'll do 2
online, we'll do uh support
first, sir, if, if you would
like to speak, you don't have
to, but if you would like to
speak, please support.
Yeah. Represent Mason.
Thank you, Representative uh.
Mr. Chair and committee didn't
really come expecting to speak,
but I would like to stand up in
favor of her bill, uh.
This to me is just another.
mandate upon our citizens of New
Mexico.
That is nonrealistic, uh,
electric cars in some of the
instances she mentioned will
not.
Not make it from their home to
their.
place of employment or their
doctor's office or
And if it does, they're gonna
have, they have to wait hours to
recharge to get home. Thank you.
OK. Anyone else in the room in
support?
OK.
I'm not seeing anyone. OK, we'll
go online, uh, Paul Gessing.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of
the committee. My name's Paul
Guessing. I'm president of the
Rio Grande Foundation. We've
worked on the EV issue
extensively in recent years.
First and foremost, uh, the
environmental improvement board
is usurping.
With the governor, the
legislature's proper role in
policymaking in New Mexico, that
should concern every legislator,
no matter what their political
ideology may be.
Secondly, this EV mandate is
Simply not going to be achieved.
It is completely unrealistic.
California and other states that
have adopted it already
recognized.
That they simply cannot obtain
and sell enough electric
vehicles to achieve this
regulation.
So what will happen?
People will buy vehicles in
other states like Texas and
bring them here to New Mexico.
There's nothing that this uh
regulation does to stop that.
It'll kill jobs, it'll kill car
dealerships throughout New
Mexico, and it'll cost New
Mexico millions of tax dollars.
So, I urge you to support this
legislation, which will provide
common sense, and if the
legislature chooses to.
adopt an EV policy of its own.
They could do that, not through
an unelected body. Thank you.
Thank you. We'll take one more
online in opposition, Thomas
Shelley.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
My name is Tom Shelley, and I'm
a rural rancher in southern New
Mexico and Grant County. My
Cattle operation is in a remote
area and I
Have to have a one to
Truck to manage the, the steep
roads and so forth. And there
is, I can't imagine having to,
uh, or, or
There isn't available an option
that I can utilize other than,
uh, uh, a 1 ton gas or
diesel-driven vehicle. And so I
really appreciate
Representative Gail Armstrong
for bringing this forward and
protecting our uh
Livelihoods for those of us in,
in rural New Mexico, and I
appreciate it very much. Thank
you.
OK, so we're gonna come back to
the room. We're gonna do uh
support. We'll take 3 people,
uh, so I would, I would ask that
you be from different
organizations.
And you, you want to give the,
the
Speakers at the table a little
bit of space.
And we're only taking 3, so
unfortunately, sometimes we have
a little bit of a rush.
Uh, to be one of the three.
OK, thank you, and you have 2
minutes.
OK, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, thank you so much for
the opportunity to speak. My
name is Camila Feibelman. I'm
with the Sierra Clipse Rio
Grande chapter. I want to say a
couple of things. The clean cars
rules do not say anything about
what anybody has to buy. It just
says that manufacturers, as they
have agreed to do and support
doing have to bring more clean
and affordable vehicles to the
state. Anybody who's ever bought
a
as I tried to do two weeks ago,
knows that the mandate on what
car to buy is what the dealer
wants to sell you. I attempted
to buy an EV in state from a
local dealer, and I was shown
two cars for $58,000 even though
the MSRP on those cars was at
the lower end of $30,000. I
asked to order a car of my
choosing. They said, oh, we
can't do that. We don't have the
capacity for this. We have
Dozens and dozens of members who
showed up to clean car's
hearings in support of rules
that gives us some choice. These
rules don't say what dealers
have to take the cars, but
people in urban New Mexico drive
less than 30 miles a day.
So if you are in support of
having the choice to buy a clean
vehicle, please raise your hand.
Thank you.
You. Next.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and members
of the committee. My name is
Alex Shoebanks. I'm with the
Southwest Energy Efficiency
Project, also known as Sweep,
and I'm here in opposition to HB
270, which were which would
repeal New Mexico's carefully
considered advanced clean car
and clean truck rules.
Repealing these rules would
reduce access to the most energy
efficient vehicles for New
Mexico businesses and residents
and costs us all money.
Sweep researchers have
documented that electrical
electric vehicles are more
efficient and cheaper to fuel
than gasoline and diesel
vehicles.
For example, we estimate that a
typical pickup driver in Bernao
County could save on the order
of $1200 per year on fuel by
driving an electric F Ford F-150
lightning instead of a gasoline
F-150.
Over the full life of the
vehicle, that driver would save
more than $25,000 all in.
Even though the electric truck
costs more upfront, the savings
on fuel and maintenance far
outweigh the price premium.
That's like getting a 25%
discount on truck ownership. Who
wouldn't want that?
The same basic efficiency
advantages holds true for all
types of electric vehicles from
sedans to garbage trucks, and
the technology is only going to
get better over time.
However, manufacturers don't
automatically send their most
efficient vehicles to the New
Mexico market.
We need clean car and truck
rules to ensure that
manufacturers keep us on the
map.
Let's make sure that New
Mexico's, that New Mexicans stay
at the front of the line for
cost savings by keeping our
clean car and truck rolls in
place. I urge you to vote no on
HBC.
270. Thank you.
Good morning, Chair and
committee members. My name is
Alicia Care with and a native
vote, um, and then many vote
stands in strong opposition to
this bill. Our urban communities
are facing serious air quality
issues. Take Bernalillo County,
which is on the brink of
exceeding federal smog
standards. They are in fact
required to take action to
improve air quality and clean
cars rules do that. This
legislation would not only take
away these rules, but they would
prohibit similar rules in the
future. Dealers sell the car
That are on the lot. Clean car's
rules simply require
manufacturers to bring EVs to
New Mexico. Right now they're
sending these cars to places
that have these roles, you know,
I enjoy my Sunday cruises as
much as the next New Mexican,
but I would much, much rather
enjoy those cruises, uh, with
the uh with clean air and
without toxic pollution from
vehicles that are rolling coal
with black smoke from their
exhaust and other um
emissions, excuse me. So I ask
your support to uh please
pose HB 270. Thank you.
Thank you very much. We'll take
2 in opposition online. Our
first is Barbara Calif.
Good morning, Mr. Chair and
committee members. I'm Barbara
Cali, registered lobbyist for
the League of Women Voters of
New Mexico. The league supports
programs to protect clean air.
This bill would restrict the
environmental improvement
board's ability to implement
portions of the goals set by the
clean transportation fuel
Standard program to reduce motor
vehicle emissions and
incentivize manufacturers to
develop and produce cleaner
vehicles and accelerate adoption
of new technologies.
Please vote no on HB 270. Thank
you very much.
Thank you. We'll take one more
online.
PM Webb.
I could say your name, name,
please?
Kim what.
Hello.
We can't hear you.
OK, we're gonna move on, um.
And there's no more hands, so,
OK.
OK. Um, back to the sponsors,
anything to add before we go to
the committee? Yes, Mr.
Chairman, thank you very much. I
just wanna make it very, very
clear that this is about choice.
This is about, this bill is not
about electric vehicles. Um, in
fact, you'll hear testimony from
auto dealers that they are very
supportive of electric vehicles,
as am I.
Uh, we have, um, in that they've
invested hundreds of thousands
of dollars in infrastructure,
tools and training to sell and
service EV um at their
dealerships. This bill is about
government mandates for the
government is trying to tell New
Mexicans what the vehicles, what
vehicles they should be driving.
And it's actually not
The legislature telling
People what
Mandate what to drive. This is,
uh, appointed group of people.
That made this decision. This is
not in law. This is in rule.
so without Mister Chairman. Uh,
we stand for questions.
OK, going to the committee, uh,
for separative in Montoya.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um
Representative Armstrong, uh,
leader Armstrong.
Um
Well, just briefly, I know that
there were some things passed
out and uh I, I know there was a
group that stood up and talking
about that they represent all
the tribes and nations, and I
believe I have a letter from in
front of me and I think we all
have this from President Boren
of the Navajo Nation.
Who was not adequately
represented, I believe, um, his
own words here are for us to
not, um,
Um, adopt the California
regulations, and Mr. Chair and
uh
And Leader Armstrong, I think
there's a very good reason for
that.
And I'm sure we've talked about
this a lot in this committee.
But are you aware, Madam or
leader of the
a number of folks who live on
the Navajo reservation who do
not have electricity at their
home, which would mean no way to
charge an electric vehicle, Mr.
Chair and Representative, you're
aware of that number?
Uh, Mr. Chairman, uh,
Representative, I'm not aware of
the number, but I am aware I
live close to the Alamo Navajo
reservation, um, where I've
lived for over 25 years and, and
I do realize that. But
ultimately, um,
You know, I, I want people to
have a choice. I want the
dealers to have a choice, and I
want it to be market driven.
Um, and not mandated by an
appointed group of people, um,
if the legislature wants to pass
this law, then let the
legislature pass the law.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and and
Leader Armstrong. I'll give you
that number because it's been
talked about quite a bit in
here.
Uh, about 50% of anyone who
lives on the Navajo reservation
does not have electricity or
running water at their homes.
Madam Chair.
And Leader Armstrong, this is
what what we've done is
discompassionate.
To the folks on the Navajo
reservation.
This is amazingly heartless.
What we, what the governor has
instituted. Rosa Montoya, so in
keeping with the kor I, I'd ask
you to
Thank you respectful. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
I know the Navajo reservation
very well because of, um, I'm
married to a Navajo woman.
Relatives of ours live on the
Navajo reservation. The nearest
grocery stores are usually 50
miles away.
Just for
Any actual services.
And so, uh, maybe I'm a little
I, I, I, I hear people get
emotional and a little
frustrated.
This one frustrates me.
This, this is a, this is
choosing a group of people who
can afford
A $60,000 vehicle and then have
to be able to uh within 10 years
have to replace a $10,000
battery and forced it on folks
that do not have jobs, do not
have electricity, and do not
have water, and somehow,
Starving them out to save the
environment is good policy, and
I, I, I just, and I'll leave it
at that, so, so I don't get
gaveled down by the chairman.
But
Um, so I'm gonna change and just
ask this question uh to your
experts.
Mr. Chair and and experts.
Are you guys in the, in the
business of making money.
Mr. Charidan and ranking member
Mon tell you, yes, we are.
So Mr. Chairman and um and Mr.
Garcia.
Uh, folks that uh are wanting to
buy electric vehicles. If they
were, if there were more people
wanting to buy electric
vehicles, would it not be in
your best interest to sell them.
Mister Chair and ranking member,
yes, it would be, and, and we do
sell them almost every dealer in
New Mexico has EVs for sale.
Mr. Chairman and, and, uh, Mr.
Garcia.
What is the number one selling
vehicle in New Mexico.
Uh, Mr. Chair ranking member
Montoya, it's the Ford F-150 and
it's been that way for over 30
years.
So, uh, Mr. Chairman and Mr.
Garcia.
Is it in your good business
interest to sell less F-150s if
you have customers who want to
buy them.
Mr. Cheri remember Montoya
absolutely not. We want to sell
what people wanna buy and what
regardless of what it is.
So Mr. Chairman and, and Mr.
Garcia.
Uh
In other areas of consumers.
Um
If I as a consumer living in New
Mexico want a product.
And it's not offered in New
Mexico.
What is our option?
Uh, Mr. Chair member Montoya,
uh, now with the internet
searches and the availability of
vehicles online, uh, if
something's not available here,
which in a lot of cases it isn't
just because we, we don't have
any big volume dealerships at
all in our state, um, people
will go and buy a vehicle out of
state, whether it's an EV or a
polluting gas car. So thank you,
uh, Mr. Chairman and, and, and
uh Leader Armstrong.
Um, I, I had my local car
dealers come and meet with me.
And, um, Mr. Chairman and
And
Uh, Representative Armstrong,
what I heard from them is they
have a backup plan.
And that's just to move across
the border into Colorado.
That's just the backup plan,
because they can still sell to
us. It's just this will harm
GRT, one of the biggest.
Uh,
One of the biggest GRT producers
in each of our
Uh, counties or not each, but
most of our larger counties is
from vehicle sales.
This, the way that this mandate
is in place doesn't take into
consideration local budgets.
Would you like to expand on that
a bit, uh, Leader Armstrong?
Work
Uh, I think I can help with
this, uh, Mr. Chair ranking
member Monto, I think what your
dealers told you is don't move
across the border to Arizona and
Texas, Colorado has, uh, the,
the same rule that we adopted,
the only difference is Colorado
sells so many more cars that
they would be able to get more
gas vehicles, um, as the
regulations go. I just wanted to
say that, could you repeat the
question?
the point you had to. No, it
just how does this, Mr. Chair,
how will this affect GRT if
we're, if we're, if our dealers
are moving out of our
communities, how was it affected
the tax taxing Mr. Chair and
ranking member, people will
still have the vehicle register
their their vehicles here, so,
uh, and that was a major point
that we brought up is that
there's no penalty in in what
the, the uh people opposing this
bill, what they don't realize is
is that we, we want
Clean air and we agree with the
environmental concerns. It's
just that we know now that these
numbers don't work, and when you
look at the GRT number in the
vehicle registration, um,
You know, that would certainly
gonna take, it's certainly gonna
take a hit, but um,
With uh with people going out of
state and, and buying their
cars, it's, it's going to
affect, um, the, a lot of taxes
registrations and, and, and
anything that dealers have in
terms of, you know, paying our
employees in New Mexicans and
then the income tax on what they
would make because we're all
gonna have fewer employees, so
it's not from the excise tax on
the cars, but on GRT your point
is a very valid one and people
are going to keep going out of
state, but when they bring those
cars in from out of state, it
throws all the environment.
numbers out of whack because all
the data is based on replacing
our cars in New Mexico with EVs,
which is fine, but everyone's
just gonna keep their higher
polluting car longer, and then
they're gonna go buy something
out of state, so whether they
bought it here or bought it
there, we still have a gas or
diesel car coming into New
Mexico, which nobody wants to
talk about. Thank you, Mr.
Chair, and, and, um.
Mr. Garcia,
Um, just two more questions,
and, and one is
Uh
Is there the option to do what's
happening currently with Tesla,
where they've located on Navajo
or Indian reservations instead,
um, which also
That that that brings the
question, taxes, yeah. Mr. Chair
and rank member Montoya, I'll
give you a very brief answer for
that. The reason why Tesla is
going on those lands is because
they don't want to follow any
rules or, or, or follow our laws
or collect the proper taxes.
There's no consumer protection
if someone buys a car for me,
they've got my phone number and
a 90-year reputation on the line
when they've got a problem, when
they have a problem with Tesla,
they don't have the same
consumer protection. They can't
go to the Attorney General's
office or anybody.
else. Nobody wants to talk about
that. Now, Tesla does they sell
every car that Tesla sells is
sold out of Colorado or Arizona.
They don't have a dealer license
here, so there's certainly lost
money there, but um, you know,
what you're asking is, in the
future, will other retailers
follow this model, uh, to go and
sell in places where they're
unregulated and don't have to
pay taxes and all these other
things, that is certainly a
legitimate concern as the
model evolves and if, if things
keep going the way they are, I,
that's a major concern for, for
everybody. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um,
Leader Armstrong and Mr. Garcia.
Last question.
Um, an F-150.
Uh, can it be replaced if you
are a farmer, a farmer or a
rancher, can it be replaced with
an NEV pickup and if, and if
not, why?
Of Mr. Cheri member tell you the
simple answer to that question
is no, and I'm sure a lot of
people that have heard me speak
are tired of hearing this
answer, but when people ask me
about the EV mandate, my answer
is until there's an electric
F-150 that can do with a gas
F150 can do, there's no point in
discussing any of this, and
there is no truck on the market
now that comes close to doing
what an F-150 will do in terms
of range, hauling, towing.
ability to drive on dirt roads.
There's nothing even on the
horizon that's anywhere close.
There's a couple of trucks and
they're OK for driving around
town, that is, you know, some
commenters made and were
represented Armstrong is from
and, and some of you in your
constituents, there just isn't a
replacement. So until there's a
truck replacement that can do
the same thing as an F-150 and a
compact SUV that can serve most
other family needs. There's
really nothing to talk about the
technology just isn't there, and
that doesn't even get into the
lack of charging stations in New
Mexico.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you in Montoya Henry.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
leader. Thank you experts. Um, I
just had a, a couple of quick
questions that I want to make
sure I understand. With this
piece of legislation, um,
Are you eliminating the sale of
EVs?
Mr. Chairman, um, thank you for
the question, um.
Uh, Representative Henry, no.
Mr. Chairman, uh uh.
Adam, um.
In some of the testimony you've
kind of already alluded to it
with the F-150s, but when you
come from a rural area like
myself, um, and or I was raised
in Cloudcroft as well. Um, when
I look at the folks around my
communities, uh, for us, it was
about 80 miles.
80 to 100 miles round trip to
just to go to the grocery store.
Um, and that's not that, that's
not a flat trip. That's an 18%
downgrade. So going down, I'm
sure we'll do pretty good.
Coming up, especially with the
weight of these EVs, I think
that's something that should be
considered, but on the way up,
Um, that's an 18% downgrade that
these cars are gonna have to
pull. Uh, what kind of, um,
car do y'all have out there
right now that really rural New
Mexico could use to make these
sorts of trips.
Uh, Mister Car Representative
Henry, there's nothing out there
right now truck wise that even
comes close to what you're
talking about car wise, you
know, the, the EVs are getting
better every year and there are,
um, it would be a compact, uh,
EV car, um, you know, I can name
several of them if you want, but
those are the ones that are most
capable of a trip like that, but
the trucks can't do that trip.
Uh, we've just talked yesterday
or two days ago with the retired
state police chief who has a
F-150 lightning truck, and he
says he's on the edge every day
just driving from Albuquerque
and Santa Fe to himself back, so
there's the incline with La
Bajada, but I mean you turn on
the air conditioning or put two
people my size in the truck or
drive it when it's cold, that
range goes way down and all EVs
have those problems, but there
are, oh, there are multiple
choices for vehicles that would
do that 160 mile round trip for
you with no problems,
Mister Chair Leer and and expert
wouldn't do it.
In a snowstorm and a blizzard.
What's our fear there? Because
I, I, and I'm not just talking
cloudcroft there. I, I believe
there's snow everywhere, some
other places in New Mexico. How
does that affect that? Uh, Mr.
Cha and Representative Henry,
um, a lot of the EV models do
have all wheel drive available
that I believe performs um as
well as a gas or hybrid powered
all wheel drive, um.
The trucks are a little bit
different just because of the
weight of the batteries and
things like that, but, uh, if I
were driving, uh, a, a Honda
Prolog uh in a snowstorm, I
would feel just as comfortable
as driving an all-wheel drive
Subaru in the compact cars
they're, they're the same and
it's basically the same
technology. So Mr. Chair, Madam
Leader expert, I guess where I
was headed with that as well is
I've seen on, on the interstate
between uh Albuquerque, and a
lot of different spots when we
have a major
blizzard in the, in the, the
roads are shut down and you're
sitting on the interstate for
quite a while, and I know
everyone can say, well, your gas
car will run out of gas at some
point. How much more difficult
it is when we do have those
types of events. Another one
I've reached, which is in
Mexico, but my uncle lives in
Houston during the hurricane,
the interstate got shut down. A
lot of those EVs ran out of
juice.
What does it take to get those
back up and running, and how do
we clear our roads at that point
so that others can safely get to
where they're needing to go,
right? So, Mr. Chair and
Representative Henry, that's
another major concern that
nobody likes to talk about when
these vehicles run totally out
of energy. We call it that that
they get bricked and they have
to be towed.
Uh, we, we've had several, uh,
legislators have gone around the
state in EVs and run out of
charge and get stranded and have
the cars get towed that it was
the speaker, uh, it happened to
him most recently, I think I can
say that, uh, that it happened
to a most recently and they got
stranded. So yeah, your car can
run out of gas, but you're a lot
more likely to find a, a gas
station, but if you turn, pull
off on the side of the road and
want to keep your heater going
or anything like that. It's the
same concern. I would have the
same concern as being stranded
in a.
I was in a gas car, it's just if
the ED runs totally out, you're
in for a very expensive tow bill
that the EV manufacturers aren't
paying and a costly repair bill.
We have them towed into us all
the time when people run out of
power, and most of the time it's
what you're talking about there
in New Mexico, they get stuck in
bad weather, it gets cold and
they don't have it calculated
right.
Mr. Chair, later and experts,
uh, I'm gonna even expand it. I
don't need an answer on it, but
I do know in the last couple of
days between Roswell and
Artesia, 25% shut down a number
of times due to dust. So it's
not just winter, it's not just
rain, uh, apparently there's
dust in New Mexico, um, for
those that didn't know. You're
welcome. Um, I think that's my
biggest concern, and I love, I
love what you said, uh, Madam
Leader of the market demand.
Uh, that's something I've even
heard in this committee.
Mr. Chairman, uh, later that we
want the market to demand what
they're wanting to do. We heard
it most recently when we're
talking about royalty rates and
leases, we wanted the market
demand to to understand the
pricing. I think that's really
important when we're talking
about these things. I don't
think any of us are against EVs
or the hybrids or whatever kind
of car you want to buy, if
that's the car you would like to
buy, you should be able to buy
that, and I'm fully support
that.
But for my area, for rural New
Mexico, uh, EVs are not a
practical use for us when we've
got folks in the oil field on
the ranches, on the farms, even
simple folks going from
Cloudcroft, weed, timber on to
Almogordo, which is probably
their closest big grocery store.
You're talking hundreds of miles
that they're putting on these
cars, and the grades that
they're going up, that 18% is
just from album to cloud croft.
If you're going to we.
You got more to go. You're not
gonna make it.
And so we're limiting these
folks to what they can do and
how they can live and the
choices they get to make. And I
have an issue with that.
I have no problem if you want to
buy an electric vehicle.
But for the state to mandate
what we're buying, that's where
my issue is. I think this
legislation is very well done
because it puts it back in the
hand of the consumers. If the
consumers, to your point, are
begging for EVs. What are you
gonna do, Mister Chair, expert.
Uh, Mr. Chair and, and, uh
And, uh, Representative Henry,
you're 100% right. I'm gonna
stock in the manufacturers are
going to send me what sells, but
the bottom line is, is my dad
would say the proofs in the
pudding were still under 4% in
EBs here, there isn't the demand
and people can blame the
manufacturers or blame the
dealers, but people in New
Mexico vote with their
pocketbooks. If they're buying
them, the manufacturers would be
building them and it's not just
in New Mexico, this, this type
of mandate is failing
everywhere. It can't, it just
can't work. There has
to be a better way for the, for
to handle and solve our
environmental concerns, which we
all have about clean air,
especially in Burleyo County,
there has to be a better way to
achieve those goals through
hybrids, plug-in hybrids, other
programs or something, there has
to be a better way than doing it
this way cause ED sales are the
same as they were when we
started this 3 years ago,
despite all the promises made
and claims made by experts. It's
just not there. There has to be
a better solution now, and I, I
wish.
the legislature would be able to
craft something like that. So,
Mr. Chair, leader and experts,
I, I really appreciate that
answer. I think that's exactly
why I land where I do on many of
these bills, um, again, EVs are,
are great if that's what you
want.
F-150s are great if that's what
you want.
Um, in Artesia.
We have 250 power strokes, but
they're great if that's what you
want, um, to mandate to us that
we have to have EVs that will
never work in my ear. We're
pulling too many loads, too much
stuff and driving too far, even
if it's simple as, as going to a
grocery store. So I fully
support this and I thank you for
your answers.
Thank you, Representative Dixon.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um,
Thank you for this discussion.
Uh, it's
I think it's a very important
discussion, and helpful um for
us as legislators to hear
directly from people impacted,
um, in this debate. Uh, Mr.
Chair, uh, and Leader Armstrong.
I have a couple of questions
that, um, I think we're gonna
help me understand a little bit
better. First, um, our hybrids
included.
In this mandate? OK.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative
Dixon, hybrids are not included
in this, which is a major
problem because hybrids are the
logical stepping stone to get
people either mentally or
literally from the step from
higher polluting cars to EVs or
whatever the end solution is,
um, plug-in hybrids, which are a
very small percentage, and I
personally believe or should be
the technology that we're
embracing. They basically earn a
15th credit of a car versus an
EV even.
though they pollute slightly
more, I think it's like 5.7%
more um
um I'm almost positive that's
what the number that I heard
from um the uh experts last
time, but, uh, regular hybrids
are not included and they, they
should be.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. um, thank
you, Mr. Garcia. Um, our
hydrogen fuel cells included?
And do we have any um stations
in New Mexico or dealerships in
New Mexico that offer those. Mr.
Chair and Representative Dixon,
it's interesting that you asked
that. I've always thought that
fuel cell technology was going
to be the future in this, and uh
Honda, we've been a Honda dealer
for 50 years, and they really
led the way in this technology,
and I really felt that there was
going to be the future. It sort
of got to a point where it was.
cost prohibitive in a couple of
manufacturers have pilot
programs in California, one of
them being Hyundai, um, where
they have hydrogen fuel cells
stations. I don't know of any in
New Mexico, but no dealers sell
um the fuel cell cars here, um.
Uh, that I'm aware of and no, no
manufacturers uh sell hydrogen
fuel cell cars to New Mexico
dealers.
Thank you, Mr. Terry. Thank you,
Mr. Garcia. Um, can you walk me
through how uh this mandate
specifically impacts a
dealership, because am I correct
in thinking that you have to
purchase the vehicles or how
does it work when a dealership
gets the vehicles from the
manufacturer. How does that
affect the business?
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative
Dixon, that's a great question.
I'll give you a brief, uh,
The brief answer there. So when
a, when a, when we order a car
for a customer, we order cars
for stock or the manufacturer
tells us we have to take 10
amount of cars, which happens
most of the time. We get billed
for those cars in full, usually
anywhere from a week to 2 weeks
before the cars arrive on our
lot, so we start paying daily
interest on those cars, uh,
every single day, whether it's
gas, EV, hybrid, whatever it is,
we start paying those interest
charge.
s every day and obviously right
now with interest rates being
where they are, are carrying
costs are very high. So every
dealer tries to have the lowest,
what we call is a day supply to
give consumers enough selection
for what they want, um, and
then, uh, and meanwhile, having
our cost be as low as they can.
But when you have models and
every brand has them that don't
sell as well. You're carrying
costs become very expensive, so
the EVs, um, which, you know, my
one of my main
criticisms of EBs is they're too
expensive, right? I've always
said that in, in the more
affordable they get, the better
this thing's gonna do, but it's
just not there yet.
But when the EVs, you know, we
just got into uh electric
Cadillac Escalades that are
$160,000 we're paying money on
those every single day that they
don't sell, so it's, it's.
When you have cars that don't
sell, it's crippling for an auto
dealer whether it's an EP or a
gas car, um, the EVs just tend
to sit a little bit longer.
And, and Mr. Chairman, uh, Madam
Representative, I would just
like to add that under this
Mandate, they are required to
take and supply so many EVs.
And as he stated,
after as as he stated, the
percentage um of people that
actually want the EVs is, is not
there. And he would like to add
something else. Mister Charid
representative Dixon, I realized
I didn't answer your question in
full. So the example that I
always use, uh, when, with the,
the 43% and a lot of people
forget it's 82% in 2032, but
take my Honda dealership that
sells 150 new cars a month if I
have to have 40 and I sold, uh,
I think we sold 7 EVs there last
month. So if the 7 has to
represent 43% of my vehicles I'm
gonna get 9 that gas vehicles
versus the 143 that I need or
142 that I need, so that's what
you're asking is, so then I have
all those less cars to sell to
people, then they're forced to
go buy something else, keep an
older, higher polluting car
longer, one less trade in that I
get on my lot for someone to buy
for their high school student or
something like that, so it's
really
a domino effect.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. um, thank
you, Leader Armstrong and Mr.
Garcia. When is the next, so,
um, when is the next increase in
percentage. Where are we right
now and when does that uh go up
again?
Uh, Mr. Chair and Representative
Dixon, so for the 2026 model
year which we're starting to get
2026 is now, uh, it's 43%, so
here's the rub, right? No, no
one's getting to 43%. No
manufacturer can produce 43% of
their inventory is EBs except
for Tesla and the total LEV
markers, um, vehicle
manufacturers. So what are we
going to do? There's nobody
anywhere near that number. So
this 2026
is a big year because it's 43,
but it goes up 8% a year after
that. So it, it ends up for New
Mexico at 82% in 2032 in
California ends at 100% in 2035.
So we just have a bunch of
unrealistic numbers that nobody
can hit and and someone said
earlier that the auto
manufacturers worked with
California on these uh rules,
that's 100% not true. There's no
auto manufacturer that has come
out in support of ACC 2 at all
in the new legislative.
that's coming out to overturn
it, General Motors, Toyota,
Stolantis, they're all opposed
to it, um, and they were never
consulted much like in New
Mexico, we weren't consulted,
you weren't consulted as
legislators, we weren't
consulted as small business
people, uh, and what this would
affect. and I think everybody,
even on both sides would have
come up with a better solution
than this.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
for that. Um,
Just checking my uh list of
questions. Um,
Mr. um, chair and um leader.
I, uh, I love my electric
vehicle. I have charged in um
Vaughan many times, Carrizozo. I
hung out at the McDonald's in
Carlsbad and Artesia, uh, while
waiting for my vehicle to
charge, um, but I do understand
that it is, it's not for
everyone right now. Um, I
Wish that the, the rule included
hybrids and sort of uh more
transition vehicles for New
Mexico. Um, I think everyone
knows that I'm a fan of hydrogen
and hydrogen fuel cells, they're
actually, they dominate the
market and in a number of East
Asian countries. Um.
Mr. Chair and leader.
When we talk about climate
change, um, you know, uh, my
colleague mentioned market
demand. I do believe that
economics.
And basic supply and demand.
I don't think we should make
decisions as a legislature
without factoring that in.
However,
I think the climate crisis is a
very unique situation, and I
have certainly advocated for
policies that
Um, allow the government to um
impact those directly. Um, and I
think that this is a policy that
does that. Um, I don't
necessarily agree with
delegating what I think is
legislative authority to the
EIB. I've also been very vocal
about that in the past. Um,
And another area, Mr. Chair and
leader that I have been vocal is
that I think a lot of times this
state is too narrowly focused on
addressing climate change, and
we don't actually look at low
hanging fruit.
For greenhouse gas reductions,
um, and instead we
Bypass those because they may
not uh sound as good.
Um, Mr. Chair, uh, and leader, I
I'm not gonna be able to support
the bill.
Um, I think this is a really
important debate, and I think it
is a very uh difficult situation
that our, our dealerships, our
business owners, um, employers
of, you know, our community
members have been put in. Um, I
think that it would be valuable
for the governor and the
legislature to have discussions
in the interim to really figure
out um what are, what
it.
What can be modified. Um,
So that this works better for um
more people in New Mexico. Um,
but I did wanna just um
be very upfront um about my uh
perspective on this, and I
really appreciate the
conversation. Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Thank you, Representative for
representative Peter, uh, so by
the way, uh, roll calls been
open for some time now with we'd
like to bring this to a vote,
um,
uh, Beta if you could be brief.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
um, minority leader and I'm
sorry, could you please tell me
your name?
Uh, Mr. Chas representative of
Betas Carlos Garcia Garcia,
thank you.
I live on the Navajoish and I
lived there my entire life,
except for the time that I went
to law school. I lived in Tucson
and my first semester roommate
and I were complete opposites,
but we lived exactly the same
distance away from Tucson, she
drove an electric car and I
drove a gasoline car, um, and
She had to be strategic in her
time frame to go home and then I
was zooming past Deming and made
it home through hatch.
Um, one of the concerns I have
though is that even after law
school working for Navajo Nation
Department of Justice and
traveling to WinderRock going 2
hours one way. I never had the
option of getting an electric
vehicle, and I'll tell you why,
and I have some problems with uh
respectfully Representative
Murphy's position and the letter
that has been provided by um
Bill, which is dated last year.
And I don't know what's been
done since then, but really, I
believe people in the Navajo
Nation are being held hostage to
gasoline vehicles because he's
not provided an option for us to
have electric vehicles. Can you
tell me how many electric
charging stations are on the
Navajo Nation.
Uh, Mr. Chad Representative
Abita, you've proven my whole
point for 3 years President Nyre
and I talked to him recently. He
said everything in his letters
current and it's still his
position, but it's, it's a
bureaucratic red tape situation
from federal money to get these
charging stations put in to the
250,000 square miles in the
Navajo Nation, you know,
obviously, we have failed as a
state and the DOT is nowhere
near hit the numbers that
they've projected that they need
to hit.
And the numbers, uh, I mean, not
having ready water and
electricity to me is talked
about being held hostage, but,
uh, you know, those concerns
would be ahead of EV charging
stations, but I know there are
very few in the Navajo Nation
and, and I think there should be
more. I agree with you 100%
thank you um minority floor
leader, that's actually none.
There's none. And so what I'm
saying is that I feel like the
position that he has taken on
this letter is inadequate
because they
No market there because there's
no way for us to sustain it.
And we may want that choice,
like the way Leader Armstrong
said, like the way
Representative Henry had said we
want to have that choice, but
we're not given that choice
because of the bureaucracy, um,
my concern with this is that,
um, I like having the option you
have a high majority of native
indigenous people who live in
urban areas who also want this
option and um I want them to
continue to have that. And I'm
sorry.
Uh, um, Mr. Chairman, uh,
Representative Obeda, um, right
now they, they have the choice.
They can put it if they want to
put an electric charging in
their home, they could do that
if they have electricity
available, ultimately what we're
saying is that this this letter
came out when the um the
Uh, EIB made the decision.
This is not a legislative
decision. This is an appointed
uh board's decision that was
made.
All we're saying is we want you
to have that option. We want you
to be able to choose an electric
vehicle or a gas vehicle. We
want you to have that option.
But what we're saying is,
dealers are being mandated to
carry electric vehicles on
their.
On their dealerships.
That are not selling, and they,
they are paying for those, and
that's, that's all we're saying.
We want everyone to have a
choice.
Thank you, Madam Chair, or
excuse me, uh, thank you,
Chairman and Madam floor leader,
um, minority leader and Mr.
Garcia. I agree with that, but I
don't agree with the position
that um the reason why there's
not a market.
is because of these other
Issues laid out in the letter
that you provided. Um, I don't
agree with that, and because of
that, I simply can't support
this. I think that any
initiative to go towards cleaner
air quality is a good one, but I
do thank you for bringing this
to us. Thank you.
Thank you some some small
briefly if possible. Yes, thank
you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, madam
for uh minority leader, um,
experts, Mr. Chair, experts, is
there sort of an auto dealer
sort of third way position. Have
you proposed sort of a lower
percentage. Um, Mr. Cha and, and
Representative Small absolutely,
unfortunately, um, the EPA when
all this started, they said you,
there was a there's
The Federal standard, um, and
then there's the California
standard and the EPA said they
don't want all 50 states coming
out with a different rule. So as
we have said from the beginning
and, and New Mexico is a unique
state, right? There's, we have
nothing in common with
California from the amount of
miles people drive to incomes to
demographics, all those things,
even Colorado has a higher
income than than California
right now. So what we proposed
early on, very early on, was
delayed implement
ation for us to catch up on Sat
incentives, which we have the
worst of any of these states.
It's not even something that
factors into the monthly payment
of the car. We talked about
delayed implementation and let's
go and ask the EPA, let us have
our own, because geographically
we're so different. So we think
the layed implementation and
even if it were a more
reasonable number than 43%
because our sales have to go up
1,000%. I mean, everybody here
is smart enough to know in
one year, that's not gonna
happen. But if they said, OK,
well, let's, let's do everything
we can as New Mexicans to
protect our clean air and fight
for clean air, and let's try to,
let's have some real competitive
state incentives and try to get
to 10% and double our sales and
include hybrids and encourage
people to buy cleaner vehicles
and trade their older cars. We
talked about a cash for clunkers
to get these old higher
polluting cars out and get them
into EVs. Everything fell on
deaf ears cause it was
California or nothing, right?
And that's really
The problem for New Mexico and
also for all the other states
that got looped in this and some
of them backed off it because
they realized it was too
extreme. It's, it's not gonna
work in California, uh, but we
did propose a lot of other
things. OK, uh, thank you, Mr.
Chair. Thank you, experts. Thank
you, Madam Flo leader. Mr.
Chair, Madam floor leader,
experts, um, sort of going to
the micro now. It's my
understanding that many
dealerships offer home charging,
uh, sort of packages with EVs.
Is that something?
that you're familiar with?
Uh, Mr. Chair and Representative
Smalley absolutely so my
dealerships, I can speak for the
ones that we own, um, my people
are trained where there are home
charging cords and things that
come with the cars. We talked to
people about upgraded service.
We have multiple providers that
we put people in touch with.
There's new PNM programs where
one of the dealers that signed
up initially for the new P&M,
um, rebate, um, and we do
encourage people to have home
charging because it gives them a
lot more safety and security,
and I believe that.
That is something and, and to be
honest with you, the, the
consumers looking at these cars,
the amount of research they do
is extreme, so they know about
those options and we uh further
explain them to them if they
need it. Got it. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Thank
you, Madam Madam minority leader
in uh experts uh that sort of
driving expansion of
electrification with the
vehicles seems like a very
positive feature, Mr. Chair, and
it seems like, um, yeah, and
there's a lot of work.
Clearly that we can do, Mr.
Chair, and minority leader
experts. I also won't be able to
support the bill. I appreciate
the conversation. I think it's
interesting to explore sort of a
wider approach and um if there
is sort of space that drives
significant uh expanded options
for consumers, which
Mr. Chair, Madam Flo leader, I
think there's also, it seems not
to go too long, but the there's
an argument here and we've seen
a lot of folks in the room today
where folks are in many parts of
the state are asking for more EB
options.
And so I think there's
You know, it's a tough balance
to walk. Perhaps this is as we
go through the interim, there's
a way to look at more New Mexico
focused approaches.
Uh, and potentially with sort of
coupled with investment and what
have you. I appreciate very much
the conversation and always the
minority floor leaders
leadership. I won't be able to
support it, but thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Uh, Armstrong, uh, anything to
add briefly before we go to the
committee? Most certainly, thank
you very much. Thank you all for
your consideration and and
letting us present this bill. We
understand that there's a lot of
conversations to happen, um, but
I, I would also just remind
everyone to give away our
legislative authority, uh, and
to do this through rule when
things change in New Mexico.
Other side will not be happy. So
thank you, Mr. Chairman.
What's the pleasure of the
committee
do pass, um, Mr. Chairman.
