So this young man
has done a lot in his short
life he's
an attorney after his
work at Saint Louis
Missouri
he was in the Air Force

to hire him for the work he did in
the Air Force because he

here but
yes Senator Stewart thank you so much for
the introduction I had
chairwoman Duhigg chair
vice chair harm
our harmony
hope how to me hello and distinguished
Senate members at
like you have just heard my name
is Darren white but most people
do call me ND
I'm here today and
I'm deeply honored to be considered
for confirmation to the
gaming control board I
have currently served in this public
member board position for over
2 years at and
along with Mr van Billups
we're currently the longest serving
members on that
board this experience
has provided me with valuable
experience
and insight into
the state gaming industry
as a lifelong New Mexican and
a brand new parent I'm dedicated
and passionate about the
success of our great
state in my
professional capacity as an
attorney I have a profound
appreciation for
navigating the complexities
of highly regulated
sectors this is
exemplified my current
involvement with the recreational
cannabis industry within our
state such
experiences have not only
broadened my understanding
but also instilled a sense of
dedication to ensure
that industry operate fairly
transparently and within
the bounds of the law
it with this backdrop that I
believe that my continued service
on the gaming control board would
be immensely
valuable it's important
to note that as the public board
member this is an unpaid
position this is something I'm
very passionate about
my aim remains to contribute
thoughtfully leveraging my
legal experience and industry
knowledge to further the board's
objectives I'm
really grateful for this opportunity
and I remain committed to the
responsibilities that
come with it I really
appreciate your
consideration.
Thank you so much Senator
Padilla.
Hi good afternoon Mister vice
chair and madam chair and members of the
committee Senator Michael Padilla
here thank you very much for
a your flexibility today
I absolutely wanted
to personally I
want to personally be here to present
this country because I'm very
proud of his work in our
community 27
years in the field of business
management accounting has
absolutely I can't
think of another I couldn't find
another certification that
this candidate could obtain
so that I think we do very well
we both very well to have this kind of an
individual on this board
because the type of work that they
do in addition to
that he does a ton of things
like mentoring business
operators and professionals that
way has done a tremendous
amount in the community just as a
volunteer
he's he served on this board
is you know what which is one of our more
important
negotiating boards and bodies
that they do the work that they do
I'm very proud to to stand here and
support him and as I
said I can't imagine
I I looked I really did after
reviewing his resume and and
spend some time learning more about it
I can't think of any other
certification that he can
probably tell us himself and
so will let him do that but thank you very much for
allowing me to be here with you and I'm very proud to
present him to you
Vanderbilt's.
Thank you senator.
Yes thank you all for
for taking the time
to meet with with
with Indian Indian
I regarding the New Mexico
gaming control board
my background
is
investments in
tax and finance
and business they know that sounds
very very boring
and it is
how it was thinking of the the
the group that was right before us
needing a finance person
I said mmhm they have to
consider that
but we're right where I think I
excel especially
in in this organization.
Is that I I have the
ability
to.
To see
that the big picture and
and you would think that that would
be common sense and
everyone can but I'm also
able to put my
ego and and pride
aside and to get
the most out of the people I'm
working with I I don't have a
problem asking for help or
questions but I'm
also have the ability
to to lead this
group there
are times where
personalities in communication
will get in the way of
certain situations
and I'm able to break down
those walls and those silos
and get people to cooperate
and communicate
and I think
yes my my audit
background helps when it comes
to to regulations
and efficiencies
but I think it's my
communication skills that are able
to bring these these people
together and and
help them work together
for for the goal of
the New Mexico gaming control
board to be 100
percent honest when I was appointed
to this this group or I
got I got a phone call from a list
although she's not here
to to ask me if I would be interested
as the CPA member of this
board I honestly
said tell me again
who you are and what what is
this for do again I just
had to do some some research because I
wasn't quite sure what
was going on there so
it's taken me
a. But
months even years
to to learn all that
the bit the acronyms
for government whether
it's CPO or DFA
and for 2 months I had to
see can you just tell me the whole
word and and not just
LFC in the
cafe and so
I think I'm I'm beyond that
that learning curve
but yes
to to Senator PS
point I I do also
sit on the board for
meals on wheels
I am passionate about
feeding feeding the hungry
of the state I'm passionate
about children
coaching.
And I don't know if they're certifications
for that for those things but those are my
passions I want to be a teacher
growing up
well I had the math skills apparently
I didn't have to I
don't know why I couldn't be I still want to be
a teacher I I had my teachers
and nurses my mother was a
nurse registered nurse.
I was born in Phoenix
Arizona but moved here when I was
10 and for
that for the last
47 years I've
I've been in in New Mexico
when to to Rio Grande High
School university in New
Mexico and
and I've been a
CPA for over a
decade.
Thank you.
Thank you so much on Mexico to
questions or comments from the
committee.
Senator Duhigg.
Thank you Mr chair
I'm just I'm
looking at the.
The statute you all
are under.
Because it says here in our
book that
law enforcement the CPA
and attorney members serve
full time
and receive salaries and
I know you're not taking a
salary
this isn't here basically if
if you do take a salary you
can't have any other
employment.
But that the
subsection about
that says
that you shall
be full time state
officials and shall
receive
salary
I'm.
So I guess what my question
is.
Is there a need for
you guys to be full
time I'm assuming not
since you are not I I
just I just wonder if we should if this is
a claim that we should
do at some
point
right to me at all this is the
board of full
time employees
right and and
then present that's why I thought it was
so strange but it
it is.
Yes in the big book
and and says
60 - to a -
I
need.
So long Forsman certified
public accountant and turning members
of the board shall be
full time state officials and
shall receive a salary set by the
governor the public
member and ex officio board
shall not receive
salaries
at and if you could turn your
Mike on thank
you. A
chairwoman to hang the those 3
members are full time
and do work full time at the gaming
control board I'm the only one that
doesn't. Okay
so I think I was assuming that you
are the attorney member of the
public your the CPA
member.
Okay hold on
okay thank you
sorry I was.
So.
Management of the whole board school time
also I'm I was with you that I was
a little kid he is
full but I didn't realize when
I heard Mr white say
that. Our act
great thank thank you for clarifying
that for
me.
I guess my other question is
because you guys have like subpoena
power you guys act
have all sorts of power have
how often does
that get used
I know you you
it it terrifies
me a little bit that you all have been there 2
years near the longest serving
members.
But and
in those 2
years have have you'll
see in that that power
use.
Madam chair Mister chair members of
the committee note we have have not
used that subpoena
power now I would imagine
that our
attorney member would
but currently that
that see is is
vacant and answer
your question
earlier
the CPA
member is
is there
the law enforcement
members there
the 3 members
vacant and
then we have in
the and then
the racing
commission chair
person is
also on our board as
well and
Indies and
in this case houses
spots are are not
salaried.
But because I'm not an attorney
I don't understand the
the subpoena power can
CPA's subpoena
people now
I was gonna say if that's the case then
I may have to
start.
Chairman and vice chair
and senator snow we we've
not utilize that power
since I have I've been
on the board and it it
has not been brought up
so.
What what what kinds of things
had are are you all seen
over the last 2
years.
With regards to the New Mexico gaming
control board yeah
generally and
right now we also have a vacancy
in our in our state gaming
Representative liaison
between the tribes
and and the state
hi I have I am the
acting person in in that
role as well
and with that
we we see.
And and before I talked about the
communication barriers as
well there there
was.
Some.
Hesitancy from from
the tribal governments
to work with
the state government
and me as the
person in the in the
middle. I
get to go back and forth
and try to encourage both sides
to to communicate and
I think this is
a good.
Opportunity for the
the the 2
governments.
To kind of bridge
the those differences we have a
contact in place
and sometimes there's issues
where. One
side or the other side deal like
they're not being Representative
enough and although
I'm I'm not an attorney
when when both sides of a contract
feel like they're being under representative
it's probably a good
contract.
Yes
but those are the type of things that we're
seeing outside the agency
we we regulate
also the the non
profits whether
it's the the veterans
the building because the
racinos we
also talk with them as
well.
There's revenue sharing with the
tribe's there are
tax revenues from
the the race
tracks as
well.
Keeping them in
compliance is with the
organization itself
does we have
6 departments
that work together to
keep that the
regulations and communications
with with all these entities
flowing.
Madam chair of the answers your
question thank you very
much that's all I have
Mister thank you senator
Ortiz Y. Pino.
Thank you Mr chairman
so.
Thank you first of all for being willing
to to take on this
responsibility thank you
for offering to serve
and and and for
serving already you've already been
on all done
up. But I'm
still trying to get a
handle so
that.
Tribal gambling
which is legal
most of the state
gambling takes place at the
tribal casinos I assume
you have no authority over them
so that is that
right.
Madam chairman Mr chair and
members of the committee we
we have no regulation
over the the tribes in the
compact but what we do is we
monitor.
The.
The topics for the
the items within the contract
which includes things like
revenue sharing
types of gaming
okay so while
each time has their own
gaming authority
we work with those at the
Ortiz
to.
Manage the compliance or to monitor
the compliance of the
contacts.
And this is very
helpful so but then
you indicated the Mr
chairman of
Mr bill ups the
that the
tribe's Elise
initially there was some
resistance are they are they much
more collaborative now are they
willing to share that information
that you need to do
your monitoring activity or is
that still an issue.
Madam chair Mister chair
members of the committee I
I believe it
has I've personally
gone out to.
Maybe roughly half of
the that
the tribes submit that
tribal governors
with email correspondence
and phone calls with with the
remaining and
yes I did sense a
hesitancy but
I believe now
that.
They they see a
person they see a face state they
realize that
that the state
is not just trying
to take every
dollar that they can and that we're
willing to work together
I'm I see
yes yes thank
your question Senator
Pino yes I believe
that those areas are coming
down.
And madam chair there's as you
heard earlier there is a gaming Representative
that liaises between this
board right and
and the tribe yes yes
as an example former state
representative Georgene Louis was the
game representative prior to becoming
a state legislator she served
in that role as a conduit between
the 2. And
and Mr Chairman
then just to pursue
this a little farther who
does regulate the
tribal gaming
activities in the state of the
self regulated because of
their sovereign status
so
madam chair Mister chair members of
the committee yes they they are
self regulated
with regards to each
tribe's individual gaming
commission but they're also
over overseen by and National
Board to the
national Indian gaming commission
for example.
And there are federal
statutes
that that also.
Dictate what can
and cannot happen
within these tribal but
it is your role to
make sure
that.
Whatever revenues are generated
that letter do the state are
being paid.
Madam chair Mister chair members of
committee correct okay good
and then one last question and
then the receipt knows
those you do regularly
is that is that the case
of and and so
the state racing
commission handles the horse
racing.
And you or or do you handle the
betting on the horse racing or
and this is the receipt of
that you the to
regulate of you would
have a. Madam
chair Mister chair members the
committee great question
yes the the racing
commission monitors
and and dictates the
the horse racing
dates timing
events we
monitor
the.
I guess the casino
portion
of so with regards
to the the slot
machines
that that's where
and the in the gaming
revenue generated from
that is what The
New Mexico in control board
regulates just a
quick quick
the pure curiosity
question how
how are the revenues
from gaming are they
trending up in the state or
down or they flat to
what's happening in terms
of
now that more people are working they probably
don't have much time to gamble
but no there working
there more money to gamble with
so what what's the
what's happening.
Madam chair Mister chair members of the
committee.
Also a great question I
think with with
any and I came in we came
in right
after the pandemic so
there was a time where we were
actually closed race
track for close because he knows were
closed and so
just the the task
of the re opening
procedures the.
The the the policies
and processes
of sanitation
and getting people to trust
the environment to come
back that has
now
increased.
Highly in in the last
3 years of now my guess
is because of Indian myself
but the claim
was a.
But ever since we've come in
that they have have gone
up 343
for more great
good thank you thank you Mr
chairman thank you Senator
CENIC's
thank you Mr chair thank you
gentleman for
coming to
offer your services to the
state it does
indicate I want to go
back to the horse racing
it does indicate that
you may conduct
background investigations
pursuant to the horse racing
Act. Now
I'm hearing that you're
indicating maybe just the
financial part of it
but recently the
governor said she wants to make sure
that they're cut back
on the doping or
eliminate the doping
what role would you have in
that
issue.
So.
Chairman and vice
chair members of
the committee it was there
we do oversee we kind of are
the umbrella agency over
you know the the indicates
India Indian
casinos and
also
the the the racing
board and so we do
have that authority you
know to make sure that they are
you know playing by all
the rules that we can oversee that but
there's a lot of negotiating that has
to be done
with the horse
racing
association
so we haven't dealt with the
doping aspect
directly
but it is something that you know would
be over our
oversight so
Mister chair and gentleman
there were 7
horses
of approximately that died
down I read does so in the
past.
6 weeks to 2 months
so what's your role in
that.
I do believe that there is a current
investigation going on as far
as tracking
you know that process
and overseeing some
of the doping regulations ago
involved with horse racing but
I haven't dealt with that personally I don't know
if van that is that
related to
your.
Board is what
I'm trying to
understand.
Who's dealing
with.
Thank you
madam chair Mister chair members of the
committee so to
those specifics
that is dealt specifically with
the racing commission.
To our point on our
board the the
chairperson of the racing commission
sits on our board so
we are informed of
those those
actions that are being handled within
the racing commission but we
do not
directly.
Dictate the actions
of the racing commission
that we can set support them
with as they
become relevant
to.
The.
That the gaming tax side
of things so for example
monies generated from the
casino are used to
help out with
things like jockey
insurance
and and payouts
things like that but
with to your point
specifically that
is how within the the racing
commission and
to to
to Mr white's point
that is a current
investigation which
they do take very
seriously.
Well thank you Mr chair I don't
I don't think that finances my
question because
you know we all get lots
of emails about horse
racing and
about
what's being done
correctly and incorrectly
and
I'm not sure who
supervising.
The activity but I appreciate
your answers thank you very
much.
Thank you so much any other
questions from the committee.
Thing I'm just a quick comment
India I worked with your data care
2 weeks so it's good I think you're
in middle school when I was
working with that it's good
to see you there practicing
law and serving on this
gaming control
board what's the will of the
committee.
I move that the
committee
do a do pass on the recommendation
for confirmation
for.
Bear in mind that the
second and vandals
Care Act after when.
For this Dan
YG thank
the motion by chairwoman
Duhigg seconded
by Senator Ortiz Y.
Pino for the confirmation of
Downpatrick quite the
second is there anyone in
opposition.
Seeing none
we actually can't take a vote
we Senator
Lopez so we'll take the
vote once we get Senator Lopez
back in and
so I'm going to just go ahead
and this portion of the agenda
we'll circle back and take
the vote. When
it when the time comes thank you
gentlemen for being here
once we get our
Senator Lopez back in the room we
will take that vote.
Madam chair Mr the would
you like the conferees to remain or
but it's alright they take office
thank you very much.
I think what we'll see again
on the Senate floor
session thank
you.
Yes thank you so much as
Senator Stewart you might want to stay
in there I know I'm
coming.
We're gonna move on to the next item
on the agenda which
is the construction
industry commission
and we'll start off with Mr eyes
the is empty good to see you
my friend if you can come up to the
table and your Senate
sponsor Senate's to Senator
Stewart we'll
do an introduction of the past
Mike over to you to make some
comments.
Thank you Mr Chairman
I'm honored
to offer
conferee of
Isay is empty to the
construction industry
commission.
I have known Isaiah
for I think it's like
5 or 6 years
we work together
on his first
bill and one of
my first
bills because
this was for
the far left and
safety dampers
that keep
buildings like
this US
keeping people safe
from smoke
and fire
so of course it's the
sheet metal workers
who make these fire
life and safety
dampers so
our bill allow
them
to be
elevated to the part
where they could
actually
be the people
that found those
dampers that
expected them that
decided which ones
need to be refurbished
or thrown out re
done etcetera so
it took us like 4
years to get that
bill which passed I
think unanimously
and it had an emergency
clause it took
us maybe 3
years through the PRC
it was really Salazar
the I'm just glad they're all
gone because all of
this P. C. conditioners
had no idea what we were
talking about
so
Isaiah
his now a
very.
Very experienced organizer
with the sheet metal
workers he's been
a attorney equipment
and Ishmael Sandia
national labs Los
Alamos national labs
Intel New Mexico
Hospital well he's
worked all over the
state he's
just one of the best organizer
some lobbyist
about things
that help everyday people these
far left of safety tempers
are absolutely
crucial
so very proud
to be working with that I say
that and offer his
confirmation
so turn it over to
him and let him say
more.
Thank you Mr vice chair and members
of the committee my name is Is is
empty and.
I have of justice here
25 years in the construction
industry in only 41
years of age
started doing construction
in high school
so I bring
a particular of set
of skills to this commission
as be the have
worked on both sides of the fence
when it comes to unionize
labor and on
organized labor
with certain various contractors
throughout New
Mexico.
There's a lot of different things within
the constructions Commission that I'm
learning to do right
now has been a hearing
officer here
in you know bad cases
of malfeasance with
contractors not performing
of what they set out
to perform with
certain end users such as
homeowners and other
end users throughout the state
so I look
forward to this commission and to serve
in the state well thank
you.
Thank you so much and I'm gonna go
ahead over to
Senator Duhigg
stepping in for Senator Moores
to introduce our
country.
Thank you Mr chair I'm
happy to introduce
Mister John
Stroud Mr
Stroud is the president
of JB Henderson
construction
where he
oversees outside
line departments and
over 1000
employees
and he has
completed projects
from folks ranging from
Intel over in Rio
Rancho 2 U. N.
M. 2 APS
and Rio Rancho public
schools and
also some work and Nevada
New York and
Virginia
and I will hand it over
to him to tell us more about
himself.
Good afternoon everybody again my
name is John Stroud I was
born here in Albuquerque
graduated high school
here went
through a you pipe
fitting apprenticeship at the
same time what do you
got a construction
engineering degree so
kind of had a a field side
and a off the
side
since that time
said to have worked as an
estimator of worked as a project
manager what we call
a division manager and
now as president of the
company
we have also recently
acquired another New Mexico
owned company and
so as
of just kind of set overall
roughly 1000 employees
about 600 of them here in
Albuquerque Russian
state New Mexico
about 400 Arizona
and said have
done everything
from residential projects to
commercial to industrial
to to
government and
I've been on the commission I'm gonna
say for probably about 2 years
now from not the
maybe even roughly 3
now and so
again have
made the
probably at least 90 percent of the meetings
have been hearing officer in
several cases as well
and
said again if you'll have me look
forward to serving.
Thank you so much Mexico to
questions and comments from committee
Senator fenics.
Thank you very much Mr chairman
thank you gentlemen for
bringing your expertise and
skills
forward.
Many many people
in the state come into
contact with C. ID
of with our projects that
they might be doing not just
on the commercial side but
residential center
what do you what role do
you all have
in of
promoting good
customer
service.
If you want to looks like
mines mine's read Saul
talk here for a little bit at least
but but yes as part
of the C. IDE
some of our roles
include
approving every contractor
and every license renewal that
that a piece of the
contracting code
said the
one of the other things is a
we have a bi monthly commissioner
meeting as part of that
clay Bailey which is the director
of C. ID gives a report
out to
include items such
as turnaround
times
as far as a
a number of calls
take in but
also on plan reviews how
many is been submitted how many's been
returned with the average turnaround
time is and
so there are
a few years ago
it was starting to get
I'm gonna say a little bit
you know hirer is getting to be a
little bit more of a concern and
so at that
point you know kind
of
I guess help support him to
get more staff
one of the things that
that that I think you'll
find is that the
state C. I. D. is in essence
of a fairly
small
number of overall permits in the
state so Albuquerque
has their own
permitting process in
Bernalillo county and
and
Kerala's has their own and
so a lot of times
what you'll find out is
Kerala's is having an issue
getting permits turned around
but state C. ID doesn't
necessarily have
100 percent control of that if that
makes sense.
Well that does make
sense except
in Santa Fe County
where I live
I live in a rural area
and when I was doing
some expansion work
several years back I had to go
through.
My County
in.
Planning and land use
and then I had to go through C.
ID.
And.
It felt like there
might have been too many
steps and
then I had to wait for inspections
inspections mostly from
C. ID.
And I'm just wondering
if there's something that we could
do with this is similar to a
question that the chair asked
another group
if there's something we could do
to make
it.
Not easier
well easier but following
the law
following the rules for
the customer.
I think there's always room for
improvement and you don't know
no matter what there's always room for
improvement on any
process
also currently the
president of AGC which is
the associated general contractors
which is directly
across the street and I
know that we have
also
and I think we actually produce the
board of all the different
regulatory steps it takes
to get a project done from
environmental which could be
happening years in advance depend
on the type of project a residential
remodels obviously different
than Hey we want to build a new
hospital or whatever but just
you know all the different steps and
there is an incredible amount of
red tape that is
is involved
one of the things that
that I say it was
kind of talking about
is we
have a set of rules
but
it seems like maybe
a half or 2 thirds
of the people follow those rules
as far as getting
a a the
permit in calling
for inspections and
so I mean we spend as part
of the board I'm gonna say we
spend.
75 percent of our
time dealing with
issues in cases where
people work more folks were following
the rules and so
therefore it makes it
in is that partially
because the process is too
cumbersome you know what you know
it very well could be
but but as of right now
we're pretty well bound
by certain rules and
regulations and it would take
a a the
a task force
I would say to really try
to increase that
but for state C. I. D.
right now I'm gonna say their turnaround
time is within a week to 2
weeks so it is
a in my mind a
very short amount of time
right now is there a
couple years ago with COVID
and some of the you
know and the after
that you know that was
that you mean times were
definitely longer but
as of right now state
C. I. D. is
it and my mind has a quick
turnaround time and I don't
think any inspection is
taken more than 2 days from the time
once called
so
so so yes again as of right
now I don't see a big
room for improvement our
need for improvement from stakes at
8 get Cummins
yes a gentleman on meal
Senator Stefanics
so in the past there was a
shortage of
inspectors in the state
recently the governor
has raised an increase to
wages for inspectors
as a retention tool
of because they were underpaid
and and that that
caused him to be understaffed
so there was a shortage there was
actually a bill that was put
out to privatize
inspections
after they've made these
wage of
modifications they've been able
to retain a lot of the state
inspectors which is
streamlined the the
processing time from
the time you submit for
a
of a permit to the time
and actually get a certified
inspector out to inspect
the projects so that turn around
time as John stated
has been significantly
reduced.
Okay so the one of the
things that we like
for you to think about is
that boards and
commissions can bring
forward
ideas of how we might
change any
existing statutes
that are
cumbersome.
That whole back
businesses from
expanding
creates more expense for
the homeowner because
of any weight Sir
any.
Of rules that don't
need to be so I'm
just asking you to put on your thinking
caps for the
future and think about customer
service both on the economic
development side but
also the residential side
thank you very much Mr chair
thank you senator Ortiz Y.
Pino.
Thank you Mr chairman and and thank
you both first for
for being willing to step
forward and and and
serve in this
capacity my
question is more
discussing the the
status the current
status of the whole
construction.
Segment of the economy in the
state right now
are we doing all we
can to
find the
contractors in the state
with the skilled
workforce that's needed
or other some things that we
at the legislature could be
doing that would.
They would make it
easier to find the
the sheet metal
workers electricians or whatever
it is that you need
so.
Gentleman Hermio members the
committee there's been
a significant decrease
unskilled and untrained
Crossman. Being
brought up you know through high
school so
if there's anyway the state legislature
could help would be to increase
funding for apprenticeship
programs of
our joint depression training
fund operates solely
on contributions
from contractors and
members we get
some
minimal amount of funding
from the public works apprenticeship
training fund but
that is not enough to
keep of the
doors open so
there were there were some bills last
session or passed through to
increase the funding for apprenticeship
programs in the state
of there's different
the schools
in the third school districts in the
state like Rio Rancho
public schools is putting on a
new CTE
program that has trades
included as
culinary arts so they're starting
to bring back those CTE
programs which
convocation would
cation when I
went through them of
so if there's any type of
funding that can help high
schools put CTE back
on and also help current
apprenticeship programs
with signing up
for every 7 retirees
were pulling in about
3 to
replace them
so we've actually had to
reach out to retirees to
come back to work
just because of the
significant loss of skilled in
trade of.
Craftsman in the
state.
Yeah I'm gonna say the
kind of echo what what
I say was saying
we've been and just a really
incredible time for at
least as long as I've been
around
said it's been just just
pretty dynamic with the
amount in need which is a good
thing you know I mean it's good
but but as
mentioned we've
came off of from about
2008 construction
hours drop
significantly
therefore we have a lot of retirees
without having a lot
of work our previous
classes were small it
was hard to bring a whole bunch of new
people into the trade you
know because of that and then all of a
sudden now we hit
this superspeed of
steep ramp
up and so
now yeah Hey what what
we do and so I think we're kind of
paying the price for
not having
some systems in place
and and
and enough work you know over the
last few years and so
it's definitely been a
challenge
I know some of the
programs there some
training programs that are
are state funded via AG
see where we're not
just trade people but
but yes when you trades but
we also need project
coordinators and project
managers and and
estimators and accountants
and and everything else
that that goes on kind
of behind the scenes in order to
keep you know the guys in the field
working and so there have
been some some programs
and if
what whatever they have is
been much appreciated
in needed
but but yeah as of right now
with what we're seeing forecast
wise we're not seeing a
big grant down
and so so
yeah I anything that that that
can help to bring
trades in whether as you said
whether that's a on the union
side or non units in non
union side
it would be a good thing right
now. Mr
chairman I can also answer
this question we put
$75000000
into our state equalization
guarantee
for CTE
maintenance or security
actually we we separated
out and put another 25000000
and just for security
and in addition in another
part of the budget we
put in $50000000
for high schools for
CTE programs
but the best thing we did
unfortunately was vetoed
was has a new
graduation requirements
bill that allow
these high school students
to get certificates
from their apprenticeship
programs that gives
them a step up
then they get hired immediately
for apprenticeship programs
if they come out of high school
with the certificates
for their first step
and can immediately
get a better salary and
be trained that so
I've already talked to the
governor and she's willing
to sign that bill again
with the few changes
but that to me that
was
that was really unfortunate
the high schools are ready to do
that and we are starting
to really ramp up in the
high schools for
a CTE programs
we've been trying to do this for
a while this last
year we actually put significant
money and if we can
now get those graduation
requirements and
it will address
these issues.
Then Mr Chairman just
a quick follow up on
that.
The another group that
did as always
seem to
me.
We might begin tapping
for these the
career field it
are the our men and women
coming out of prison
are there are there barriers
now to to
them for
being.
Or you know entrance
into a apprenticeship
programs if they have a
criminal record is that bar them
from getting in or is that
something that we don't have to worry about
we just need to reach out to
them and get them
interested
chairman of the US senator Ortiz
Y. Pino there's no restrictions
to come into an apprenticeship
program the only
restrictions would be.
Prohibiting them from working on a certain
project like a
school
if they have a
background that prohibits them from
working in a school or
a national laboratory
that's the only really red tape
that prohibits them from working
in the trade other than
that they're able to come
in for the I would
think that this would be a very
fruitful area to
to work with the corrections department
on on
on.
Beginning the friendship
while they're sitting around
being you know
being at a
state tutor.
Yeah.
Whatever it is however also
occupying their time to actually
get into a career field
of this sort would would make
their their success
outside the walls much more
likely so
something maybe we could work with
corrections department to
to expand the opportunities
for men and women coming out of
prison thank you Mr chairman
in in some of the
private employers such as
Intel also has a
fairly strict background
check that that that would make
that
not not
not possible per
se but
the one of the
areas that we do
have fairly good look at
is our armed services and
and specially having a base here in
town but but those are
our folks that that
typically also
make very good candidates
for most
have work with their hands are used
to getting up in
and and having
a regimen and and
and typically they that they make some
pretty good
employees.
Thank you Mr. Thank
you any other questions just
a couple comments from me thank you for
what you do my job
was almost national laboratory
is the chief of staff of craftsmen
and women and so
recently I believe it was in the
Washington post did an
article about New Mexico
and how the 2 laboratories
Sandia and Los
Alamos in addition to
Intel has really
taken craft
workers away from
any other projects that the state would
need to build our
infrastructure right here
and because of that we've seen a
huge turn of
people when we focused
on on high school
graduates going to college and not
into the trades that we're seeing
that huge gap in saying
what Mr Zemke said about
we lose 7
retirees we came 3
from that and so
northern New Mexico college is
working on a program with 3
public schools
Espanola
mess of the Stempel walk it
and what those schools are gonna do it
they're gonna take turns busing
students into
northern New Mexico college to
learn a trade and get a certificate
program and we're hopeful
that they will then take advantage
of the opportunity scholarship
to continue their education
and then get into that cropped
workforce so Mister them do
I'd like to hear your ideas
I'd be interested in helping you in any
way because in
my area my
district could definitely
use some help on
motivating students and getting it to
the crops and
contributing to the workforce in the
state of New Mexico so
with that the will of the
committee.
