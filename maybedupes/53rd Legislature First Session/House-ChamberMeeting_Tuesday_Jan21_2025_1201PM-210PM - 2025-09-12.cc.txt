young organizer in South
Broadway.
He's a leader of Macedonia
Baptist Church and has changed
countless lives over his many
years of service.
Including my own as a young
organizer at his church. Thank
you, Reverend Smith.
I want to thank Cat Padrell for
that beautiful rendition of the
national anthem, as well as
Mariachis and Nuevo, amigos and
Nuevo Mexico, and the Pueblo
Vacoma American Legion 116 for
presenting our colors.
I want to thank my family.
My wife Diana, my daughter
Marisela, and my son Camilo who
apparently has a tally of the

So, if anyone, if you guys want
to check the vote, he's got it.
Um, to my parents who are not

share in that sacrifice. So to
your families, thank you for
allowing your loved ones to
serve the people of the state.
I want to give a special,

making this work possible.
Folks, I'm gonna have you remain
standing because I wanna take
this moment to acknowledge.
Our dear friend and colleague
Elioli Alcon.
Who passed away last week at the
age of 74.
Chairman Alcorn was a Vietnam
veteran who earned a bronze star
for his service.
He was also a magistrate judge
and served in this roundhouse
for 16 years.
He rose to become the chair of
the Consumer and Public Affairs
Committee, and then the La
Veterans and Military Affairs
Committee and served honorably.
He was a champion of the little
guy.
And he was not afraid.
To speak truth to power.
Or work long hours. You might
remember he once called the
committee meeting at 3:30 in the
morning.
He championed his community. He
championed New Mexico's
veterans, service members and
their families. He was a
champion of tribal sovereignty.
He was a champion of our economy
and our environment.
He was a wonderful mentor to
many of us, myself included, and
a friend to all of us.
He will be greatly, greatly
missed.
Let us take a moment of silence
to remember our beloved friend
and colleague.
Chairman Elio Alcon.
Thank you. You may be seated?
Folks, we have many long days
and nights ahead of us in this
building over the next 60 days
as we work on behalf of the
people of New Mexico.
We are here to work to make
their life better and more
affordable.
To improve the safety of all of
our communities and to ensure
that every child in our state
has access to the opportunities
that they need and that they
deserve.
We're not always gonna agree on
the best way to reach these
goals, but let's not let our
disagreements distract us from
doing the work of the people.
Cause I've said many times.
We can disagree without being
disagreeable.
And we can and we should have
heated debates.
Yet we can still treat each
other with civility and respect.
My first piece of advice to all
of us.
Especially those of you who are
brand new.
When things get tough, and they
will.
Remember why you're here.
We are not here to govern by
election cycle or pursue
headlines or score political
points. We're here, we're not
here.
To boost our own egos.
We're not here for the fancy
dinners or cocktail parties. We
are here to solve the problems
of the people of New Mexico.
We're here to deliver resources
to communities far and wide from
rural frontier New Mexico to the
urban cores of our state.
We are here to prepare New
Mexico for its full potential,
for the bright future that it
deserves.
My second piece of advice to all
of us.
is to find what grounds you and
think about that every single
day you step into this building.
For me, it's my family.
After long days of committee
hearings and meetings followed
by long nights of debate on the
floor. When I'm driving home
every night to the North Valley,
usually after stopping for a
fancy dinner at Allsop's
Chimichanga.
Best dinner
I often find myself thinking on
that drive about my grandfather,
Benito.
Who was an agricultural worker
from Mexico who came to the
United States under the Bracero
program and eventually ended up
as a minor in Silver City.
I think about the kindness and
the hardships he must have faced
as an immigrant and as a laborer
in a new country.
I think about the courage that
he must have taken for him to
leave his family behind to do
that hard work.
I think of the policies that
allowed him to come here.
And the ones that made it a
little bit harder.
I also think of my own parents.
Who believe so strongly in the
power of the American dream that
they left their home and came to
New Mexico.
To give my sister and I are
shot.
I think about how hard they
worked to take care of us and
how sometimes it felt like the
deck.
was completely stacked against
them.
But I also think of the programs
and the policies.
The summer lunch program at
Mesave the park in the
International District, where
the afterschool tutoring
programs or our Catholic church
down the street.
That took us in after school.
I think of those opportunities
afforded to us and how they
impacted our lives.
Then I think about my own two
children and how I want them to
not only get the best education
possible but to also feel safe
in their neighborhood.
And I also want them to someday.
Realize New Mexico's full
potential and for themselves
decide to raise their families
here.
Because after all,
We all want the best for New
Mexico.
I know every single one of you.
Loves your family and your
community. That's why you're
here.
Representing them
In this legislature.
And I know there are many of you
special guests and, and we'll
get to introductions in a little
bit, but I do wanna take a
little bit of speaker's
prerogative here and tell you
about Norman Ramon Dorado,
sitting right here in the front.
These two individuals have been
a part of my life. They are
immigrant rights activists who
not not only advocate for
immigrant rights, they advocate
for the rights of seniors to
have healthcare. They advocate
on behalf of children to have
affordable childcare. They
advocate on behalf of our
environment. They advocate on
behalf of their neighborhood,
every single day.
Because they know that none of
these plights that we work up
against are in silos. It's all
interconnected.
A few of my guests here on the
floor.
I've got Sheriff John Allen from
Berlio County, or Berlio County
Sheriff, and we have Alan
Sanchez, the president CEO of
CHI Saint Joseph's Children.
Both of those men working
diligently day in and day out to
keep our community safe. One of
them does it by enforcing the
law to make sure that our
children are safe in our
communities. The other one does
it through prevention work by
providing the largest home
visitation program in the city
of New Mexico and guess what
those guys do it out of their
own pocket. They don't even take
a dollar from us.
And I have, uh, my friend Salah
Absi, who is a reformer, an
activist who has been working
diligently over the last few
years to reform our elections
processes and the way we conduct
primaries in New Mexico. The
next generation of leadership
represented by her here in this
chamber.
Folks, we're gonna have robust
debates.
We're going to have heated
arguments in committee on the
floor.
And we should
Because it is important that
whatever legislation gets passed
that we get the details right.
And that we think about how what
we do in this building impact
New Mexicans on a daily basis.
It is also important that we
don't take these debates too
personally or to become
paralyzed.
By the fact that we might be on
opposing sides.
And look
Some of you have known me for a
long time.
Don't take yourself too
seriously.
Have a laugh.
Right? We can joke around.
Right, it's not all heat and
debate and tension.
Look in the eyes of your
children or your grandchildren,
or your nephews, your aunt,
your, your, your, your nieces.
Look at them. Look for them for
inspiration.
Both in what we're here to
accomplish.
And in how we conduct ourselves.
Folks
We have a busy 60 days ahead.
It's not gonna be easy. It's not
gonna be always fun.
But we can make sure that we
make it as easy and as fun as
possible.
You have my word.
And I know I have yours.
I look forward to working with
each and every one of you with
our governor, with our Senate,
and with the everyday folks that
walk in through these doors.
To ask for something to give us
a piece of their mind to offer
advice, to offer solutions.
Which is gracias. I'm honored to
once again serve as your Speaker
of the House, and I look forward
to the work ahead. Adelante.
Right
Thank you.
Mr. Speaker.
