The Senate Indian Rural Culture
Affairs Committee. Welcome to
Order Anita. Please
call the roll.
>> Good morning, Senators,
Senator Sure. Uh
Senator
Mieses, uh,
Senator
Sanchez,
Senator Cher,
Senator Souls,
Senator Pinto,
32. Excuse
me.
>> Thank you. And thank you,
Senator Boone for joining us
here today. And
uh I believe this is,
is this your initiation
Committee meeting?
>> No, I, I,
no madam Chair. I, I've been
in a couple before,
uh, I presented my first
bill. I don't know a
couple of days ago, so I've got
that under my skin.
So, uh,
no, but I'm very comfortable
being here. I appreciate being
here. >> Ok. Well,
you May begin and if you have any
questions, feel free to
ask. >> Thank you. All
right. Thank you madam Chair and Members
of the Committee. I, I'm here this
morning to present
a bill to you
that
is near and dear to me
because it, it
directly affects what I do
for a living, what my family's
done for a living for five
generations. And
uh uh the agriculture industry
is, is of course,
uh very
essential to us. And
uh
Senator Ezell
says all the time, if you eat
you're involved in agriculture.
So that, that makes us
all involved
and gives us all a
stake in it.
And uh what I'm
here to talk to you this morning
about is Senate Bill
415
agritourism.
And uh what we're
asking for is
uh $350,000
from the state's General fund
for fiscal year 2026
to support the N MD A New
Mexico Department of Agriculture
and operating an Agritourism
marketing program.
And the program will
promote New Mexico's
agritourism industry,
blending agriculture and
tourism to attract
visitors and create
economic opportunities for
local farmers and ranchers.
And uh agri
agritourism is
defined as a
commercial enterprise, combining
agriculture and
tourism to bring
people to farms and
ranches or other agriculture,
businesses for entertainment,
education and income
generation.
We, we've been preaching
to each other through our
trade organizations
and through our
uh
through the groups that, that
work together
to make
about the world a better
place for agriculture.
We tell each other, we need
to tell our story and that's
what we're, we're wanting
to advance here. We're wanting
to mov'e up the
ladder and trying to tell people
who we are, what we are and what
we do and
how,
how it affects everybody.
And so the Mexico
Department of Agriculture has
expertise in, in
supporting ag markets
and they uh they've
previously hosted events
like the Agritourism
symposium and
supported operators through
professional development program.
So that's what this Bill
is about and
I I have to,
to assist me with it
today to two very
capable uh
expert witnesses.
I have with me the,
the division director
from uh Marketing
and Development New
Mexico
uh Department of
Agriculture, Jason New
and then also have with me,
Susanna Calhoun
from Calhoun flower
farms, who's a producer and
has a unique
uh
presentation to give you.
And uh so with that,
I'll, I'll
give it to
them.
>> I was briefed on the
microphones. So work
with me. Thank
you. I'm
honored to be here today. Thank you
so much for allowing me
to be in this room.
My name is Susanna
Calhoun,
where to begin. So
I am 1/5
generation rancher,
fourth generation farmer.
Um
We have
witnessed
the evolution of the last
especially 100 years of what's
going on in
agriculture in New
Mexico.
I feel that there has
been a lack of a
spotlight on what a
powerhouse New Mexico can
be. Um
Our family started with
pecan's cotton lettuce
and now we farm
flowers.
So um it
has changed a great deal just
within my family
and it is such
an honor to be in
this State.
So just as a little
bit of background, what we
do as a flower farm,
it's actually a very new concept,
particularly in the desert.
You can't grow flowers in the
desert. It's too hot. I
can't tell you how many times
I have been told that, but
we all know in this room, we
have the power of the sun, which
is actually one of our other
superpowers.
So we
started out in events
um and actually around
COVID, things changed quite
a bit. Um We lost
all of our clientele
that was fully booked for
2020
within two weeks.
Um We were almost
out of business. We had to give
back a great deal of
funds and we had to
pivot what were we gonna do with
our flowers in the ground?
So agri
tourism kind of
became this concept. We
started having a couple
people out at the
farm just to
people were curious. So
we started kind of doing that,
testing the waters.
Um A little bit of
my resume.
Uh We have just been
named the top 30 flower
farmers in the country.
Um All of the other ones
are in New York, Oregon,
Washington, and there is
one in New
Mexico.
So as a
women owned
business, that is
something we're really proud of here.
Um especially in a
male-dominated nated
agricultural
society.
So that is something
I'm truly proud of. Our
flowers have been on the cover
of Martha Stewart,
British Vogue
Reuters. They
have been in Netflix, Rocky
Mountain, Bride N
Pr Green Wedding
Shoes. And we were just
featured um in Johnny
Seeds, which is one of the
biggest premier seed companies
in the
world.
A few facts that we all
also already know. I'm just
reiterating,
we are one of the biggest
states in the country.
We are one of the poorest
states in the country. We
are one of the most undereducated
states in the country.
But actually I think we can
also turn that around for
ourselves through
agriculture and through our
minorities and
diversify.
So marketing,
when I first started this
business,
I was, I call it
pushing pedals.
I was pedaling pedals,
um with multiple
buckets in my car and
going statewide,
convincing people that I
grew these flowers in the
desert. And
um being the
biggest State in one of the
biggest states in the country that
is so difficult for a
brand new entrepreneur to
drive everywhere to convince
its character building, trust
me. And it made
driving up here,
no problem. And I was so
excited to see you.
And um
but the fact
remains that this is a
huge State. There are a
lot of rural areas
and there's not a lot of funding when
you're starting something new
facts. Um
We also are a hub
here for billion
dollar industries that I have now
witnessed Netflix
wedding industries for the last
two decades. New Mexico
has been named the top
20 destination
areas for events and
weddings. Where
does this relate?
We can now host
events and
educate our consumer
without I call New
Mexico. Sometimes the Bermuda
triangle of pricing.
It is so difficult to
find a price that
accommodates for
all our, all of our different
demographics.
So what
this allows is
the comprehension
of the consumer
to be witnessed
by themselves. We're not even
pitching it to them. There's not even
major
um
convincing, they
get to witness the
beauty of New Mexico
themselves
in a unique
way.
So
marketing,
I was trading, I was
trading my hard
worked earned
materials
um for marketing
material, I had no money
to pay a photographer
to buy a
billboard
that was out of the
question. So
my goal um
being here today is
to save new entrepreneurs
and young farmers
money. This can
truly help that while
also creating
a huge
revenue for farmers
that has never been
tapped before. Not
to mention there are multiple
states that have a lot
more sophisticated farming,
but New Mexico is actually further
ahead of them in
this
area.
So by moving
forward, we are continuing
to grow billion dollar industries
while creating a
bridge between corporate small
business and
growing. One of our major
superpowers, which is
agriculture
to finish,
a saturated comprehension
of the consumer's knowledge
of the providence of their
home goods and willingness
to pay more is
a ripple effect that will
create
different economies across
multiple platforms.
The comprehension is fully
there. They are willing
to pay. They won't
question my prices
when they get to come onto the
farm. They get how
hard it is to
make a product and start
from the beginning and see it go
to the grocery store.
This is an amazing
moment for New Mexico
to create an evolution
of agriculture.
The enchantment of New
Mexico is what
the world needs right
now.
By granting this,
you are putting New Mexico on
a diverse
international lucrative
and trajectory
platform.
Thank
you,
>> madam, Chair Members of the
Committee. Again, my
name is Jason New, I'm the division
director for the New Mexico
Department of Agriculture
Marketing and Development
Division.
Um I
wanted to talk to you a little bit
about agritourism
and New Mexico agriculture
first.
Uh agriculture
in the State of New Mexico is a
$4 billion
industry. Uh
that's generated by
farmers and ranchers.
Uh Tolling
almost
21,000 is
our latest statistics.
Um Agritourism
reported in the 2022
census,
326
farms that have
agritourism revenue
based components
to them and together they
generated an income
of over $20
million in 2022.
So they are an economic
driver.
I think Senator Boone
described and defined
agritourism very
well. Now,
how does that fit into agriculture?
How does it benefit agriculture
in many ways? I
think some of the points that I wanted
to put forth to you
first
was it's a
diversification of their
income source. It's another
way for agriculturalists
to stay competitive and
sustainable.
We have an aging population
of uh farmers and
ranchers in this State circling
around average age of
60
agritourism is another
venue. Another
means for that
next generation to stay in
agriculture. We have an
example of that right
here. We have
an opportunity for new people
to enter agriculture.
And so that's
important to,
to understand and, and
maintain where our food
comes and keep it locally
produced.
Uh There's a lot of opportunity.
We are a big producer
State, we
grow a lot of
food and a lot of it
leaves our State.
Agritourism is another
pathway for
direct farm sales.
A lot of these agritourism
operations are U tip
you, you pick
or they have uh farm
stands or there are C SAS
or tied to farmers
markets. And so
it's another pathway for
a farmer to direct,
sell their local goods to a
consumer. So
another economic and direct
input to our State keeping those
dollars in our
value chain in our
supply chain.
Um Another
threat to agriculture is
understanding
those outside of agriculture,
understanding
what the importance and value of
agriculture is.
And so there's that, that this,
this educates
attendees to agritourism
venues.
It it uh you know, it's
an entertainment venue as well,
but there's this educational
component where people can come
in from different settings around the
State. Meet
with growers,
get their hands in the soil,
pick their food
and, and learn
more and more about
how it's produced. The
challenges facing
agriculture
and, and just
grow that, that
understanding.
And so
there's there's a
lot of benefits
and as well
in terms of
technical side of
agriculture.
So agritourism not only
just has is part of
farm sites and picks,
but there's a technical aspects where
a lot of agritourism
and farms
entertain
um workshops
on soil health,
climate resilience,
um water
technology. So
there's, there's tremendous ven you
know, opportunities for
agricultural side now in the community
and economic side and tourism
dollars bring a lot to local
communities. Many of them
rural
um visitors,
local State
National International are
spending dollars on hotels,
fuel food,
restaurants
and that's, that's creating
jobs, that's creating tax
base.
And so
um with this,
you May have questions on how
does N MD A plan on administering
these dollars
and to frame it up the best way
possible as we see
most of these dollars going
direct to our agritourism operators
and throw them in the form of Michael
grants or cost
share and a minority
portion for a heart specialist
at an MD A to put together
an awareness campaign.
Where does our, our agritourism
operators in the State?
What do they offer? Who they
are? When do they
operate? And
so we see that is a minor
army investment. We see
this is a as we have
the vehicles and the mechanisms
in place, easily
put this together and deployed
in an effective and efficient
manner. Thank
you,
>> madam, Chair Members of the Committee. We're
ready for question.
>> Thank you, Senator. We
will go to those in the room
and by show of hands in
the room, how many are in
support
and in
opposition
those in support. If you would like
to speak, you May come up to the
mic
>> madam Chair Senators.
My name is Tom Patterson.
I have the privilege of serving as
President of the New
Mexico Cattle Growers
Association.
Cattle growers supports
SB
415
kettle ranchers
are probably one of the last
remaining examples
of an industry
resembling the economic
model of perfect
competition. We
don't control the prices we
pay
for our inputs or the
prices we receive
for our production.
Our profit margins
are very thin.
Livestock producers
learn that they have
to squeeze every nickel
out of our revenues.
And when that isn't
enough, we
have no choice
but to look for other income
streams
in practice. That
means part time
or full time, work off
the ranch. It
means having your spouse
work off the ranch.
It means looking for alternate
income streams for the
ranch beyond the
sale of cattle,
custom feeding,
guiding hunters.
And that's really why Senate
Bill 415 is so
important. This
appropriation will do at
least at least three
things.
It'll support
agritourism in a
deliberate meaningful
way across our
State to
allow farmers and
ranchers to
meet a demand from
people who want to spend
time on our
farms and ranches
and who are willing to pay
for the experience.
Second, it
will help create jobs
in local communities
because chances are we're
going to need outside
help to meet that
demand and
third
agritourism
will supplement revenues
for our farmers and
ranchers,
especially our
smaller ones
and the ones on the
edge.
We need such alternate
income streams,
New Mexico cattle growers
urges you to
support Senate Bill
415.
Thank
you.
>> Good morning madam, Chair and
Committee. My name is
Richard Maestas.
I am the city manager of
Rato New Mexico
in a former life. I was the
Associate dean of the
College of the
University of Nebraska's College
of Technical Agriculture
and we started a program
there, um,
entitled Combat boots
to cowboy boots, which
supported our returning
armed forces veterans to
start careers uh in
the agricultural
industry.
This bill is extremely important
because it also supports
beginning farmers,
introductory farmers, people
just getting their start
in this industry and getting their
start in this career. So
I feel that it is extremely
important to
um support
this um
this legislative,
the other thing, you know, when people
think of redone, they think more
of volcanic
rock than they really do
agriculture. But
you know, we have a lot of hydroponic
farms up there. Rammel
F family farms is one
of our local hydroponic
farmers which
provides um
lettuce,
um
vegetables, everything
you can imagine to
our community and it's all
locally grown. So
we strongly encourage you to
support our small
family businesses and
our veteran farmers. Thank
you.
>> Uh madam, Chair Members of the Committee,
Jason Espinoza representing
the New Mexico and Farm and
Livestock Bureau. Uh
We're here to support Centreville
415, which really is an
investment in agritourism, a
growing industry that
brings visitors to farms and
ranches, diversifies farm
income and strengthens our rural
communities.
Agritourism is much
more than just farm tours. It's
farm stays, you pick
operations and educational
experiences that connect
people to agriculture
while providing a much needed boost
to local economies.
Visitors don't just stop at
the agritourism
sites. They eat at local
restaurants, stay in small town
hotels and buy local
products. Multiplying
the benefits statewide.
This bill gives them an opportunity
to generate additional revenue
and share New Mexico's unique
agricultural heritage with the
world. Uh We Jewish
support. Thank you, madam,
Chair.
>> Thank you. And do we
have anybody on
Zoom?
Ok,
>> good morning madam, Chair Members
of the Committee. My
name is Arby Nichols. Um I'm
here um
speaking on behalf of the
New Mexico uh coalition
of agritourism operators
um on behalf of
Otero counties as the Otero
county attorney and
uh on behalf of my family's
operation Nichols Ranch and
Orchards, uh like
Senator Boone and Miss
Calhoun, I'm 1/5
generation farmer in New
Mexico. And
uh I want to help share
why uh why this bill is so
important.
Um
What agritourism does
for small family farms
in New Mexico is allows
them to not only survive
but but to thrive
and UHS and, and
continue for generations.
Um These small family farms
simply can't compete at the
commercial level
um with, with big
agriculture, but
with agritourism,
we're able to
um be successful
businesses that can continue
to be passed down for
generations. And
also it reduces
barriers for those that want to
get into the agricultural
industry, um
such as our veterans
and uh and other younger
Members. The average age of a
farmer currently
is around 60 years
old in America and
we need new generations to
come in. This helps
um tourism is
another benefit.
Um When
folks come uh visit
these uh agritourism
operations,
they're also staying at
hotels and RV,
parks and eating
food and buying
gas and um,
it's a huge impact in
Otero County. We
have, uh my family's operation,
Nichols Ranch and Orchards. We have heart
of the desert. Pistachios
mcginn's Pistachio
Land cad Walder Mountain
Farms, Runyon
Ranches, Mountain Park,
events, Tularosa
Vineyards and Cider
mill farms. Um
Just our operation
brings in uh
over 10,000 people
annually uh from outside
the State of New Mexico.
Um, you know, most
are from Texas but um
we get international
all across the country
and uh that is money
coming into New Mexico
that wouldn't otherwise be coming in.
So there.
Um And then
what also what's been spoken
about is education value.
Uh Most of our
operations um
have field trips that we host
annually where we're able
to connect our
uh our Children
to their food
and uh and help them
see with hands
on uh where their food
comes from and what it takes to
grow it. Uh And,
and you can't put a value
on that. Um
So growing
this industry and
helping this industry,
it, it helps the tourism
industry in, in New
Mexico as well
as um a, a bunch
of other industries
and uh and it's preserving
our agricultural
um history
and uh and
allowing it to continue for
the generations to come.
So I, I ask that you
um uh
and vote for a
due pass on this bill.
Thank
you.
>> She, good
morning madam Chair and
Members of the Committee.
Thank you for the opportunity to
speak to you all. Uh My
name is David Lucero
and my, my wife Mary
and I own Jal
farms in Fort Sumner,
New Mexico.
We planted an, a
fruit orchard, a small
fruit orchard in
2021.
And this will be our first
year going into production.
And so we're excited about
that. We're, we're
excited to,
to meet new customers
and, and have the opportunity
to promote our, our
fruits and that we'll
be selling.
Uh, we hope that you'll support
this bill and,
and, um,
help us to mov'e forward
with the agritourism industry.
Thank
you.
>> Do you have questions from Committee
Members?
Well, Senator
Boone, thank you for
bringing the bill for it. I've been
out to several
areas where, you know, even
where you pick your own strawberries,
pick your own blueberries.
Um, and the
way I grew up too
was, um, we still
have sheep and cattle that were
given to us who run about
25 sheep and about 30
head. So it's
a, it's just a weekend thing for
me. Um, sometimes
I'm a farmer,
uh, two apple
trees in the front
yard. But,
um,
I think one of the things with
agritourism and some of the
places that we have
toured through during the
interim was
um, some of the liability
that comes with bringing people
on to your property.
So I would, you know,
I, we can only do
so much during the Session. But
you're welcome to kind of address
that in a manner speaking,
maybe the there's some other
creative ideas of how
we can.
Um
you know, there, there has to be
some responsibility though, some
accountability, but how do
we, um especially if
we're gonna promote this
um as it moves forward
because we don't want anybody getting
into a situation where
we're um
it becomes uh
economic downturn
for them.
But um
it's always interesting because
when you do go pick your
own
um
produce are
uh it, it,
the premium is charged.
I mean, it, you're, you're selling
the experience to, to go
out there um for the
day and other things
surrounding it that always
um
um
pops up too in some
sense, diversifies the economy
of the area where it's not just
agriculture, like
people like coming through
and um
and it is an educational
experience too. Oh,
taking my nieces out to
pick is probably
one of the funnest things to do
too because before you get
home, you know,
just seeing, seeing them eat
healthy foods that
are less than
minutes away or a couple
of seconds coming off and,
um, being able to, I think
that's a very excellent
privilege to have.
So I
don't have any more,
have any questions just to comment about
the liability because I don't
think we've really, um, addressed
that >> madam Chair
Members of the Committee. We certainly
expected to hear that. We
know it's, it's
kind of stymied our efforts in
the past at times
because of the liability.
But I, I think we're prepared
to, to, to, to
give some answers for
that
>> madam Chairman. It's a really
solid point.
Um It's something that
we have tried to approach for
a while and the fact of the matter
is that until
this really becomes
something that we can really sink
our teeth into, we're gonna
need to keep working through
those challenges. But the
solutions that we have come
with, I'd like to share with
you.
So we are,
this is a perk
of being on private
land, right? When
you are on private land,
we do not publicize
our hours.
Um When you do not
have public hours, it's by
appointment only.
Um This helps with
your commercial driveways.
I make sure all of ours are fully
zoned and correct
in terms of
um
anyone that comes on and
making sure that any vehicle
that comes on is properly
taken care of along with
its people that are in
there. Um
Before anyone comes
on to the property,
uh we ensure
that not one but two
waivers are
signed
in our tickets,
you can purchase them
online. Um
And this is very common,
for example, I'll give you another
example for a festival.
If someone buys a ticket to a
festival, when you buy
that ticket, you are checking
a box that says I
am not going to
potentially sue you for
anything that's out of
this world. Basically.
Um There are,
there are many things in terms of
entertainment and areas
that you check
off a waiver and as
the owner of that land, you
are entitled to do so
as things get larger,
you need more coverage,
no matter what,
what we do is we put
these practices in place
while also
hosting free
events in terms of
educating the people that are
coming on to the farm. So we
make sure that they know
there are bees that can sting
you. We don't sugar coat
it. We fully make
that part of the charm in our
advertising before they even
step on. There
will always be some version
of a risk in
everything that you
do. However,
this is a very new concept,
but I fully am
confident that this could be
worked out. Um
But what we have done is
make sure that we're very
transparent with our
insurance companies. We
are very clear with the
people that are coming on.
And we also signed
with a lawyer
that has written it
a waiver that fully
discloses what they May
be coming on to
for the farm and
they fully acknowledge it in
nine years. We have never
had a single
issue.
Um I'll leave it
there
>> and uh
and thank you for that
answer and it sounds
like it's a lot to go through
because when I go
to other states,
thank God, it's the season
when we're able to go
picking. But
you just drive up
and then you get to go right out
to the field and
uh it, it, but
what you're describing, I
mean, it's a shame that we have to
come to that. But I would
explore what are other
states doing that
allow, um,
that it seems more
streamlined because they
even have stands where
it's kind of like your own
self service where it's already
picked. And
it's, it's your,
your, what is it your,
your,
your honesty in
that sense where you drive
up, put money into a
bo lockbox
and take what, what
you paid for and then you go
on your way. Um But
out here it seems very,
um >> she
just >> faulted.
>> So there's a few different
types of, for example,
you pick. And I love the one
that you described actually, which is
on everyone's honor, right?
Where you, you,
it's the honor system and you
come and it's
a, a, just a
mutual trust
between human beings which I
love. Um That's an
excellent point though, there
are multiple types
of agritourism
and frankly, some other
states don't have the
Legislation either. So there's
frankly still a bit of
grayness in other states
as well that I think needs
to be um
clarified in terms
of insurance.
Every State is facing
the same challenge that you
have brought up in terms of
fine tuning the
insurance policies.
Um The honor code
is actually one of the ways
the loopholes that I have read
from other farmers
where it doesn't
create as much liability because
they're not holding Clippers, they're
not interacting
with tractors, they're not going
by a ditch that's full of
water, they're going to pick
up on already
made
project basically
or, or a product.
Um So I've learned
that in different farms and
different offerings for
these different ranches and
farms, there's gonna be a
different type of entry
in one, for example,
there's a large pumpkin
patch. Um, I
believe right outside
of Albuquerque, they still
have a giant sign that has
a huge waiver and says,
hey, look, you're still coming
