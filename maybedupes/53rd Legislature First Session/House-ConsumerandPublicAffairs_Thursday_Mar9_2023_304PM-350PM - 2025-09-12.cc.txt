Alright.
To have a for.
Wonderful so we're just gonna go
in order in our on our agenda
starting with Senate bill one
thirty two.
Have Representative Ortez is yes
you want to introduce your yes
madam chair my experts Kaylee
here.
Right with that go head.
I thank you madam chair a Senate
bill one thirty two addresses
the rising rates of sexually
transmitted infections by
eliminating faster copay Policy
doctor bills and costsharing for
preventive care and treatment of
sexually transmitted infections
a lot of New Mexicans don't see
Care for S. T. eyes because of
the high out of pocket costs
this is a huge problem because
as TI's can get more dangerous
and a much more expensive to
treat if you don't treat them
early on and if you don't have
to preventive care so that can
lead to problems like
infertility and other STI's and
that's a real problem so this
bill seeks to address that that
I stand for questions.
Thank you what that will go to
the audience is there anyone in
opposition of this bill.

Thank you madam chair.
I've got a bill that has been
amended and amended and amended.
And.
I've got FOR a room the the last
from your house.
That was a complaint by the
Attorney General.
That said.
What is.
Let me explain the bill.
Bill is the timing of a lot of
the lot if.
Lottery winner in other words if
someone million wins a million
dollars are going to have
million for.
Therefore I'm trying to figure
out a way to keep their
identities secret unless they
wanted to be made public.
And.
to give them the opportunity to.
Get used to the new found
wealth.
So maybe they can actually help
their selves interface.
So I've had opened of help
amending bill.
And some of the amendments
including taking out of section
one in the bill.
what that section one then I had
to take it up in the up title
amending New Mexico lottery Act
because we've taken out the New
Mexico lottery Act and then I
had to
we took out in page three.
Line.
Twenty one lottery contractors
and then we had to put lottery
contracted back yet because of
the way the thing read it which
says the the authority a lot of
contractors and the Human
Services department the taxation
and revenue department or.
An employee of the same ones so
we had to use those same
definition twice there to make
it sound right and also in
Senate Judiciary online twenty
five.
After disclose if said shall not
disclose to the public
our publishing the name so.
With that alternative.
Members.
And again come to you with
another.
And the amendment simply is I
think you had one email to me if
not.
I will teach I will take me
bring it to you.
In this.
Hello.
And I will be the man to.
So the question the Attorney
General that was this.
It is noted that Senate bill one
ninety eight provides a penalty
for a person who violates this
provision but the statute also
prohibits state entities from
disclosure but it does not
provide a penalty or remedy for
state entity.
Who is up well it puts.
The of the authority HSD TRD who
is an entity who violates this
provision so the I went to
Council services morning and I
apologize for not getting this
quicker but time is what it is
so I want to that the council
service more and this is the
amendment that I came up with
home page for between lines
thirteen and fourteen insert the
following noon subsections.
C..
A person claiming to be
aggrieved by the violation of
this section may file a
complaint with the entity leads
to have committing the violation
or that employees the person
alleged to have committed the
violation upon receipt of the
complaint the end to show
immediately investigate the
alleged act sees any violations
you're gonna tip conciliation
what to complain.
David do.
A person a district attorney are
they Attorney General may bring
an action in District Court of
the county in which a violation
of this section has occurred for
appropriate relief including
temporary Slevin merry commented
injected relief compensatory
damages or punitive damages and
the number two is related re
lettering the subsections
according.
So.
I would I would ask that to be
adopted as an amendment to
mobile.
Do I need to sign that or do you
need to sign well I need someone
from the committee to move your
amendment okay.
Session anyone want to madam
chair on offer discussion.
Representative all right on the
amendment is there any
discussion on the amendment.
I don't see any from our your
teammate discussion.
I do have some questions so just
flagging what we have heard
about their the language of the
bill refers to the authority of
the Human Services department of
taxation and revenue department
rather than to introduce our
state entities
So going back to the semantics
we may have to.
Work with.
What that story is
So I need you think I need madam
chair you think I need to the
flag Authority.
I think yes I think that that's
what's missing would with the
word lottery Authority the
sufficient.
I think what this forty that
you're referring to in the bill
misters
Senator is really
Is meaning that this state
entities meeting Services
Department tax department tax
revenue.
and.
So maybe that story we should we
should say state entities.
And I'm just trying to figure
out some looking at the
amendments in contexts where
that is and I'm.
Transplant we are to.
Our.
In the amendment.
All right what will we want
since I can't find it
Going back to letter C. the one
proposed
So the the bill applies to state
entities which cannot be charged
with criminal offenses so I
think we need to figure out the
language regarding the
violations.
and who have the accountability
of the state entities.
So I guess the question is on
and letter D. what when you talk
about the cop compensatory
damages or punitive damages does
that go to the state entity.
I assume when you say goes to
you are saying.
Does that go against the that's
correct and to do and to the the
person that is.
Raymond of nation that's right
so when you look at the
subsection do it says that
The district attorney to bring
an action
For relief the question is who's
get providing that released and
that would mean that the
Permanent injunctive relief
compensatory damages or punitive
damages would go to the state is
that your intent.
Senator.
It would go it would go against
the.
The.
And to to the.
I don't think a missing your
point you're you're saying
you're saying.
Who do they so who are who do
they asked to pay we leave
that's right and that would be
the entity the state in.
And the the relief would go to
the person that was violated
which they gave up personal
information from.
Okay so that makes it language
here.
For us so is the is the state
entity just the go between to
collect damages I guess right
here the way it's worded
The person the wait the Lotto
winner
District attorney or Attorney
General may bring an action.
And I guess the question is.
We need to clarify.
The action against who.
Direction of what relief and
action against to so.
Representative action against
whom right there is where we
need to know like the state
entity it would have to be put
in right after action.
And what would be.
The state entity.
A state entity.
That that.
We're still or are you looking
at the amendments and contacts
just so with all following a
long slow.
We're on page
Page four yes ma'am.
So
We talking is is that
clarifiers.
Now.
I.
I'm sorry I didn't bring council
service with me that's right I
think it's just on the hot of
wrap around about who were
targeting here what you're
asking is the Attorney General
to.
Basically cero the state
government for that injunctive
compensatory or punitive relief.
And
And then the question is what's
the step after that on
collecting for that place.
I think that the damages are
ultimately received by the
person who.
But that information out there.
For the I guess in this case the
state entities the information
there.
So it would go to.
So we would say.
The.
I don't know if the lottery
winner for a good place where we
do.
Send it back to the council
service to get the wording right
just because a lot of questions
so the question but the question
you're asking so I can take note
okay the question you're asking
is after punitive damages you
need to know.
those damages go to.
Right.
That's correct I think that
right now there's we just need
to understand whether the
district attorney or Attorney
General raise the action we
secretly from the state and see.
If there if awarded damages this
right here it just it it's
worded is if there
met to pay regardless of outcome
I think there's just a couple
steps that we need to clarify
before getting to the damages
that might be received and then
how to whom it goes and and how
the intermediary between that
goes back to that.
Aggrieved party.
so I'm.
I think we may need to.
To amend this further.
Well it's okay
Hello never expected to get this
far.
Madam chair Madam chair
representative or senator is
there is can you briefly explain
what the purpose of what is it
you're you're just wanting
complete anonymous and and and
that and that amenity from the
person who wins the lottery the
lottery correct.
Yes what I'm trying to do is to
protect them from the public the
you know the the card are
vicious con artist in in the
public the general public so I'm
trying to keep their name out of
the newspaper I'm trying to keep
it out of of the public domain
so that they have a chance to do
something their selves and and
with that I'm try I was trying
to make some kind of.
You know when I started out it
was pretty simple deal to my
mind well as it came alone you
know well they wanted me to say
you know be sure to go into
action revenue and then there
statutes of the day couldn't
give the information out and and
you know go to the lottery
administration to make sure they
could give it out and so it just
keeps going to another step well
address that they can give you
that will how do you punish you
if they don't give it out.
So that's the place we're at
right now.
If that makes sense.
I don't I hope.
And if that makes sense I'd be
happy to explain I have two
quick questions hopefully madam
chair and senator okay so couple
things one I I appreciate if you
were a survivor domestic
violence you're trying to and
you don't want your XML that's a
great thing it would probably I
want people to know you the
perfect name but I do question
can these records be it further
they just.
But the madam chair and
representative no that can't be.
Look at all so the perfect that
that's the other part of this
this.
And that's that's one of the
regional newspapers didn't like
this at all because they wanted
to have the opportunity to make
a big splash one big winter
came.
But it can't be improved under
this section Senator I think
that you have the right I mean
if you want to be in the paper
you could say Hey I want to be
favor but if you don't want to
for any reason you should be
able to set up my information
up thank you madam chair and
senator Chuck.
thank you madam chair thank you
representative or senator pardon
me
It's a long day right which we
pass our to a Verde song so I'm
excited about that but so madam
chair Senator on.
I get this bill I to I really do
support it because I think these
con artists to.
Prey on these individuals so
madam chair Senator.
What's so this ammendment here
what would this do in context to
the purpose of your bills madam
chair this this last in did you
get a copy I just got a copy and
I'm trying to the last amendment
of the Attorney General.
And and the House analysis of
the Attorney General made
statements that on the last page
of the analysis.
The FOR the last page of the.
Staples.
notes that the S. B. one ninety
eight provides a bill before
person.
Who violates a provision but the
statute also prohibits state
entities from disclosure but
does not provide a penalty or
remedy for state energy the
forty.
HSD TRD.
Who is who as an entity violates
a provision so what if.
I hacker gets in some way and
get this information personal
information is violated so what
is the penalty for them.
And so that's were I would I
started this morning with
council service and got this.
To to give to to put some skin.
In a game against the entity
itself the the state itself not
only against the employee that
much let that out but again it's
the the HSD so to speak and it's
it's funny.
When I read this the first thing
I thought about was qualified
immunity right that's the first
thing about the order that you
know we don't want
Someone to use that defense if
there an employee of the state
and so that's what this is
trying to do just kind of bring
it all together and I'm not an
attorney so I can take it to an
attorney.
Okay thank you madam chair and
senator and yeah that's exactly
the the point I was going to
make you know this qualified
immunity since we don't have it
anymore.
What is to say you cannot
personally to someone that maybe
let it slip or something so yeah
I really appreciate that madam
chair and senator and then on on
the FIR here on the last page it
talks about claiming the prized.
Some that.
Source madam chair and senator.
So the presidency in our Bucks
agency because the lottery
headquarters in Albuquerque or
by mail.
The the prize it depends on how
hi dollars the price is as to
where you claim the prize okay
and I think it's six hundred
dollars as we're you have to go
into the
Facility in Albuquerque to start
cleaning prices just.
So it's a pretty low threshold.
You know
the Senator Pirtle thought that
I should raise that threshold up
there too some dollar but what's
what's some dollar to someone
that is very important.
The.
So that so thank you madam chair
and senator and yeah I do see
we're probably Senator Pirtle
thought well I guess if we're I
live in Alamogordo have to drive
two and half hours to
Albuquerque and stay the night
in the gas it might cut into
those winnings but if we can do
about the mail which I see we
can Madam chair Senator then
that takes away the concern so I
really appreciate your bill and
I I can't wait to vote for an
answer hope I win the lottery
and if I do there will be signs
but I won't put it out there.
Better chair of heard that ever.
Ever committee that I've been in
I want to win the lottery.
Thank you senator I just have a
few comments I think that's real
challenge as you rightly
discussed is how to how to cope
with these penalties and for
those who disclose I think when
we talk about it's not qualified
immunity it's actually
unconstitutional to see that see
the state unless there's a
person that is you're targeting
Steven to that the secretary or
someone like that the head of
the tip of the spear we can
actually to the state so that's
that's what we're talking about
here and I think that
with the the protected personal
identifier penalty is where
you're gonna get in trouble with
House Judiciary if this moves
forward because even with this
language on the state entity you
know we're taking away state
funds so I wonder if it's enough
to prohibit the disclosure of
this information without
instituting the penalty that's
where we get into the
constitution tricking us of this
Is that would that be something
of interest to you Senator so I
need to say like
The to close the penalty the
state a misdemeanor.
A felony or is that what you're
saying I'm saying Senator that
it's what we're talking about
penalizing government for the
the act something like this
right you can't sue a state
entity that's federal and so
when we talk about you could you
could perhaps see the secretary
for doing that but now we're
getting into punitive damages
and some other tricky things
that it's up to judges
discretion of having these types
of damages even at a petty
misdemeanor is where we're going
to have that back and forth and
so your the bill is strong I
just prohibiting the information
disclosure and then if someone
creates a lawsuit it's up to the
the judge then to to figure out
what the damages might be
without this type of statute so
my recommendation is because I
think I can tell you that it may
not get to the finish line with
these types of penalties through
judiciary which is my committee
next so if it might be easier to
just without the semantics of
what's the right penalty into
who just get rid of that penalty
all together and just make it so
that this information is not
disclosed which I think everyone
is really sympathetic to you
because we want to encourage
participation
in you know our state lotteries
at but we don't want that
information disclosed without
having the penalty they're still
gets you to you know the at
least the rule of law saying
it's not something we want but
without actually instituting a
penalty use I think there would
be diss will leave in this
office so my recommendation to
you senators to just get rid of
that penalty section all
together and I think that with
having the.
Information that's required you
get to the what is required and
then if somebody files a lawsuit
the judge can decide what the
penalty is.
This one question lost.
So and do this you would not
have that ago I wouldn't strike
out all the new material from
section your new section one the
lottery winners protected
personal identifier information
penalty and basically everything
from a two year new suggested
team which of that committee
just be.
Stricken from having to worry
about what the penalty would you
what penalty you would come up
with versus what so you're
talking on the regional.
I'm I'm in the amendments in
context you're looking at what
we have in our.
Okay section C. home page for.
No on the amendment in context
it would be all of paid for at
the top of I.
And then your bill is just
talking about what information
we want to
T. private exactly without
instituting penalties so you're
talking about Startin section.
Search for.
You which correct.
Like at all of that that's just
now section one from Senate
Judiciary from new material all
that all that new material just
don't worry about the penalty
okay worry about your your
amendment and then we just get
to the point of.
What information should not be
discussed so and section five to
look at that age I all of
section to keep and so we're
we're we're just striking out
the penalty.
Okay.
And that way if the we do this
to make sure that.
He said the law in place so that
they don't do it and then
lawsuits filed that it's up to
the judge's discretion without
having to guess what the right
that would be and they can still
collect damages punitive or
otherwise okay so the bill would
actually.
Goals from.
Which start.
H. middle the home page but.
Language about the course read
more Canadian of.
This bill will.
I think that's where where all
the confusion has
Representative from our analysis
here's just what's the right
penalty for something like this.
Who's in charge and I think if
we get to the point where it's
it's enforced that this
information should not be
disclosed I think that gets you.
Thank.
So
if you'd like a committee
substitute I think that would be
great and if it's the will of
the committee and if were in
agreement with the strike
throughs and the amendment
making sense that you would take
a SCS to the next committee.
Okay which I would.
Okay.
All right well so that's every
and there there's a is there any
opposition to the amendment
Representative Ferrary.
Madam chair I was just going to
move that we make the committee
substitute as you suggested.
Okay and that we I have a do not
pass on.
You forgot the bill number I'm
sorry ninety eight Senate bill
one ninety.
Senate bill one ninety eight as
amended and amended amended and
they do pass committee
substitute for.
Senate bill one ninety eight.
we have a second by
Representative board.
Is there any opposition to the
amendment.
Alright with that Senator you're
on your way.
No.
What is it's very interesting
you for your hard and I just
parks thank you senator
yesterday.
When the upcoming year you'd be
so real simple.
Thank you.
We.
All right Senator Ortiz Y. Pino
thank you for joining us what
from great to see you again
we're on Senate bill three ten.
Go ahead senator you have a
thank you madam president madam
chairman and committee members
of my expert witness I think it
is on soon it is the Jamie.
They certainly do a blank last
name from doing Ana County
health and health and and Human
Services director for Dona Ana
County Senate bill three.
Senate bill three ten is
actually more bill for the
building I think you've already
passed out of the house House
Bill or at least you yes your
committee three seventy three
the crisis triage center bill.
And we we amended the Senate
bill three tend to bring it into
compliance or it remained with
your with your version of this
bill that involve the.
And making it licensed.
Our therapist rather than
professional or therapist and
what was the other change there
is one other little change
I think that was that was
basically the the hard so and
and as you as you will recall
what the bill does is it makes
it possible for crisis triage
centers.
To receive people brought in.
By police or EMTs who are
undergoing some emotional or
drug or alcohol related crisis
and and and who ordinarily it
before the Roadrunner Strayer
centers they would be taken to
emergency rooms read into jails
the whole point of the crisis
triage centers to hold them for
a for a couple of days set up to
seventy two hours get him
stabilized when they're it if it
doesn't take seventy two hours a
they don't need to hold them for
seventy two but to hold them
until they are stable and then
try to get him into some kind of
longer term treatment
and with that I'll stand for
questions right senator is there
anyone in opposition to this
bill.
Is there any opposition on.
Hey anyone in favor of possible
three ten.
R. eight anyone want to speak on
this bill go ahead.
if you could just come up and
share the microphone there's one
right sort of these.
Thanks Karen.
But.
Madam chair representative
committee Karen Canaday with the
national association of social
workers New Mexico chapter and
we standing very strong support
of this these have these tries
crisis triage centers have
worked miracles and I don't try
I try not to use that verbiage I
this this really has in other
areas in Tucson they have they
implemented one as a result of
the shooting that shot Gabby
Giffords and the federal judge
there into some and they have
had no violent encounters as a
result since then and that has
been ten years now so that's
huge and so we just want to
stand in very strong support
this thank you Mr.
Thank you.
Thank you madam chair Jim
Jackson on behalf of disability
rights New Mexico this proposal
does give up people in a mental
health crisis an opportunity to
go someplace other than jail or
a hospital and it does have
really beneficial impacts it's a
very short term placement
typically at these triage
centers you all a past the house
version of this bill already so
I'd encourage you to do the same
with the Senate bill thank you.
It.
Thank you madam chair.
Yeah I guess that was holding it
the wrong I can't read on it.
I apologize madam chair members
of the committee Ellen plants
representing the disability
coalition right now if the
police pick up somebody who's
experiencing a mental health
crisis the only places they can
take them our jail or emergency
department and hospital neither
of them this is the right place
for person in mental health
crisis to be by changing this to
allow them to to put take
somebody involuntarily to a
crisis triage center they offer
an alternative that is a much
more appropriate place to take
that ordinarily we are advocates
for people with disabilities
ordinarily we don't like the
idea of involuntary treatment
but this is an exception aware
of taking them involuntarily
quote and quote because they are
in police custody this is the
right thing to do so we do
support the bill thank you.
Madam chair members of the
committee Charlie mark is
registered lobbyists for the
county of Dona this concept has
evolved over the last decade
of Senator Mary Kay Papen was
the first one to appropriate
money to build the facility
since then they've had plenty of
time to study it one brought up
before the New Mexico counties
the comment that was stated was
this is a much better place than
where we taken today so I
encourage you to to look at this
to support this and to pass
thank you very much.
LCG.
Okay interesting Joan Dickerson
and.
Go ahead.
Madam chair members of the
committee John Dickerson was the
veterans and military families
caucus and for all the reasons
previously stated we also
support this bill we urge you to
pass thank you very much.
What else online no.
All right back to the sponsor do
anything else we should know
madam chairman thank you.
Of the committee Representative
Ferrary chairwoman Ferrary.
Thank you madam chair I just
would like to speak on behalf of
this also because of not only
because it's in the my
community but also because
they're in the number of.
Examples of where people have
When they could have gone to the
triage center and had you know
evaluation and then
supportive Services in
alternative
K. to go we're also working in
our community for Soteria
Los crucis where people can go
for psychoses problems and if
they were first taken to like I
understand it was a veteran and
he was having a psychotic
episode and so they took him to
jail and stayed there for over a
year instead of possibility of
going to the triage center
building diagnose to refer to
different places such as Soteria
or other
You know.
Then you would have lost that
year this life and also not
getting a treatment that he
deserves so I think this is a
really good
Alternative for our community to
be able to have you know this
involuntary as well out of.
For a referral so.
With that high I just want to.
Hello everyone support for this.
