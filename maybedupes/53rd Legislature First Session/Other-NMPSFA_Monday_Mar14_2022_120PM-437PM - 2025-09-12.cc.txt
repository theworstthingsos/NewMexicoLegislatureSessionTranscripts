Mr chair members we had a few
adjustments since the words a
committee of a few
recommendations that we address
that we'd like to go over there
it over those if you don't mind.
Instructional material which
should decrease for FY twenty
one by twenty five grow in FY is
this a pager system.
Thank you Mr chair members it's
on page nine it's we're still on
page nine yes in the words of
committee meeting we still have
you have in support of the
changes.
You we do the changes from the
last meeting but that of yours
right.
Mr Mr chair again Mr Abbey
reflects the changes but they're
not right thank you.
Director Avid to follow up with
that sorry she later.
FY twenty one instructional
material decreased by twenty
five point zero for FY twenty
one FY twenty two instructional
material decreased by twenty
five point zero.
Security increase for FY twenty
two by nine point nine.
FY twenty three security
increased that is in the project
award summary from the action of
council and that will be one
thirty in the FY twenty two
awards cycle.
FY twenty two.
Why.
Up for capital improvements
online eight there is increase
of ten point nine from house
bill one nineteen for FY twenty
three in FY twenty four.
And I think Mr chair members the
other are requests that you made
of us was down on the road
thirty thirty one and thirty two
where we have the FY twenty two
awards cycle and then we also
included the FY twenty two
second round of awards and then
we set total that there and that
there is a change that was not
on the previous
awards.
The previous yes you see
financial plan.
With that said Mr chair members
if we were ready to stand for
any questions that you might
have.
Questions.
Financial.
Chair on for FY twenty two from
school buses I don't believe the
allocation of twelve point five.
Three point three.
Take a look at that.
And then also on allocation in
FY two.
Mister chair Mister teas with if
we take a look at that and get
back to you.
Mr chair I believe FY twenty two
the allocation and house bill
two eighty five was three point
four three point five.
And I don't I have to look
through with the year before
once.
Thank you.
The.
You assumed a lack of demand.
What because a lot of
certification.
One issue in July.
Was that.
Presented to the wards.
Mr chair members the zero.
FY twenty three what was
Representative two words if we
felt that is because it already
enough money has already been
certified.
That we would need to certify
anymore because this uncommitted
bell sexually.
Right.
It will from the point of
committee but.
Mr Chairman director Abbey yes
it was also propped in.
That committee that there was
not an average for the FY twenty
three cycle awards.
It would be in line thirty
three.
call in FY twenty four estimate
of seventy two point four that's
an average of the past to work
cycles.
Yes take a shared the my notes
from the words of committee
meeting with director so you
added a another award the twenty
four which was there previously.
Seventy two Director Abbey yes
and that's it.
I have a cover of one more
question the.
The housing standards in this
photo of this the right place
as.
We have some point for housing
what is the process of where we
in the process to develop
standards for housing.
Mr chair members we are hoping
to be done with those in this in
the late spring Mr chair
Director Abbey when we did the
pre K. route three here boards
in the second round of FY twenty
two the teacher housing coverage
back on it on our work plan a
little bit so we're making
awards for housing despite not
having standards.
Right Mr chair members.
Those awards for housings with
the ones that we included in the
existing projects for gas.
At apparently for scare or.
Okay where is the list of.
What thirty three where is the
list of those projects were
like.
It would be twenty three.
I see your page to the.
To.
What do we do cover that we're
we care.
The director of it was just an
estimate based on the work
cycles and all what what
particular project so when we
get the item I will see some
detail
We'll see some of the details
of.
Mr chairman Jack those estimates
that you're we're talking about
for FY twenty three is what we
went through the rain to Liz and
we picked what projects we
thought would come forward what
we need waivers but wouldn't but
we show that detail in January
but we don't have that detail
for FY twenty three here with us
today but we're more than happy
to be with us in April or email
it to this okay Page two twenty
three.
Priips.
Basically for us with the.
Mr chair members the pre have so
we've actually received but when
we were working to do the the
the.
On sale with we had to estimate
what projects we have come
forward in FY twenty three so
they're two separate things so
it's just a preemption relate to
FY twenty two second cycle or.
The chair members to create
apps.
These awards will be made FY in
July July twenty three.
Table that we received the
application I guess we've
already received the application
for the second cycle twenty two.
That's correct.
If we had what was the bonding
capacity that we could have got
if we.
We needed to be factored grow
to in FY twenty three zero.
What would have been so.
Mr Chairman director of the I
don't know how to do with me but
based on conversations with what
finance that is the capacity
fund for the December sales.
Your.
But.
Well received in July of cash
which.
Yes Sir would be would be zero
but the
Mr Chairman director LFC with
the conversation with board of
finance the three fifty four
point three would be the
estimated January.
Mr Chairman but part of it is.
We had a lot of discussion in
the words of the committee.
The challenges getting projects.
If you just want.
Two twenty three.
Which.
This is credible to projects.
What did I think it would.
Thirty two.
Thirty three part.
give comment thank you Mr chair
director Abbey I just want to
remind us this council that this
is the first year that we've
gone.
Year round for awards and we
just opened up in January so in
my view from January to March
the fact that we have eight
awards is is a good sign because
we now we have March till the
end of the year to accept of
course I do have eight in three
short ones Mr chair and members
I feel as a positive note.
Well the cycle.
Those of us are really bring in
whole stack of applications.
Mr chair members that is correct
and I have a list of schools
that we're actively working with
to check to see if they're going
to apply as well we'd like to
get that done.
Before December but certainly
student for July.
Well.
The conversation reports was
looking look at twenty four we
almost a half a billion.
The generals.
Pretty much as far as the eye
can see.
Of the.
There are efforts to.
Spend more money.
Including seventy five million
Sen here so we're always what
grow is that.
There is a role.
Twenty one of the seven million
that's basically just a doling
it out by the way I also one of
the awards that I hope we would
have.
Well that come next month the
seventy five million Mr chair
members this but we have to have
somebody.
You know a plan and a very
simple form not too much red
tape but so know what you're
what they planned to use it of
the as they spend it how it's
getting used maybe quarterly or
what's your reporting but but
again we've got a half billion
surplus I think we have a few
new projects coming in we have
no request as far as I can tell
from Gallup.
Mr chair members not it is we do
or don't we don't.
And then we discussed also
reported a change.
The past several years ago is
making.
Applications much less
attractive to many of the
districts like Albuquerque will
go to one eighty five percent
local match.
When fully phased the.
Albuquerque got twelve million
credits.
of local capital outlay for
alright so a combination of
both.
A cumulative credits.
Hello hello match you know the
district with the third schools
in the state is coming and I
just was.
So we don't have.
Gallup again I don't think we it
was only is all schools is only
a new Senator we have a couple
of stating I don't know if we
have more projects coming so I
think all this is to say.
In a way I I think we discussed
awards the need to we think a
lot of.
Issues including part eight the
leading the funding formula
change which is predicated off
for we able to the state again
what what the impact aid credit.
Which was a huge benefit for of
the the litigation the impact
aid.
It gets but those who ask for
for no credit it's so there need
to funding is less and that was
the basis for changing the
formula and that now that seems.
Less than a.
So all this is in my mind she
gestures at the council of the
pre I'd suggest should be
proactive the staff proactive in
really we thinking how we do our
best if we have a half billion
stacked up if we're not getting
folks the folks that districts
coming in the last funding for
all other reasons.
It's really a challenge for the
task force to look at this and
legislative staff at least a
meeting with the the task force
which of course by.
Representative Romero this year
right we know that the funding.
The bill that passed to do away
with the impact aid credit ask
for rethinking the formula but
not till twenty four electric
that's almost too long with this
kind of money stacked up it is
unprecedented that we didn't
sort of I the need for one I
don't think that's a wrap.
It's not that could change that
so action we need to review of
their sure but at this point
it's to me it's a signal.
The statutes or sending the
council more money that can use
effectively and yet who would
use it if if the council does
anticipate a similar questions
don't select which is that
there's a the talk about this
for some and I think it's coming
forward this week want to make
those observations sure.
A conversation with.
About.
Possible changes to to the.
Submitted to the task force.
Recommendations at the.
A lot of.
Recommendation.
At.
But for them for all those
reasons that communicated I
think the primary one is the
match you know there's a lot of
local communities that.
Getting those passed by the
voters of course the cost cost
of projects.
Along with us trying to
streamline.
The purpose of the process.
The photo one more thing we
talked about a lot and that's
the waivers.
Almost the only business coming
the council's districts that.
that match I want for waiver
whether it is often because they
have opposed all their budget
capacity I use the example of
tools that is.
There is also a corolla thirty
wealth part of.
Cardoso's fixing well there are
probably the day they just don't
have a dollar bond issue the
qualified four hundred percent
waiver thirty five million
dollars school the opportunity
that the road corona will tend
districts which had proposals
hardly any adaptive the schools
are antiquated.
But it is the the and they're
not eligible under the ten
percent match so just there are
a lot of equity issues that come
into play as well yes.
Actually.
If you're just.
Actually I.
Good.
Chair just a comment I know
we've got a lot of
Feedback from districts or the
council or maybe the task force
and rolling and we stopped the
council was maybe about adequacy
and that's been especially level
to get him into the thank you
school districts in the other
Martinez if.
Requests that maybe the council
or the state look at that so
that may be another option
students at.
People to.
Okay maybe our Mr chair to to
implement some type programs
were the state would not help
fund above adequacy items to
see.
Right those are all the
discussion.
Questions.
will want to.
Conricus.
All of.
Mr chair would you like us to
mislead your.
Well well.
Actually.
Okay great we're gonna move on
to the Bobby conciliation so
realistic that questions
identified.
The legislative thank you.
But.
Good afternoon Mister chair
members I assume they are here
on the Pacific consultant and I
wanted to go over the three
three feet the findings that
were.
During my work at peace of
faith.
so the first one the first topic
is missing projects from one
research patient reconciliation
work.
Using those worksheets with the
reserves over time and there
were projects on there that
we're missing dropped off and it
created on tracking
discrepancies and sometimes okay
usual inactive on balances.
Also we cert reconciliation
worksheets the one that I just
mentioned as well as the
resolutions were not present.
You may have approved them but
they were never sent to.
Support.
So it offsets when not.
Reflected on the re
certifications that cost
Representative Alcon balances as
well as projects that were
rescinded another point in time
these projects were rescinded
and never reflected on the
certifications.
So projects were either I'm cert
over certified and what I should
have done is preference all of
this by saying that this is been
a collaborative effort with Mr
what is in our field department
as well as with the board of
finance and consolidates with
state with state for finance has
been paid off in this
reconciliation process
so with that being said.
There is a lot of projects that
were under certified or
certified so what we did is we
spent countless hours working
with our field the president
going project my project see
what the costs are what the
costs were looking estimated
costs are going to be and really
working with them looking at
this project with the fine to
call to make sure not only do we
reconcile declines but also give
you more accurate readings on
the financial I.
So that has been such a great
after on the.
Side about three three excuse if
you will.
some different other distances
were.
Differences in these projects
from the preliminary awards when
they would first come to you
prior to the applications to
what was actually awarded so no
we certifications were done
after they were awarded.
There was one bond that was over
certified so we.
Have more we had request for
many of the funds and there
wasn't enough so we need to take
a project at one bond
recertified to another one to
make sure that did not happen.
Multiple projects or certified
multiple times so there may have
been an award but of course for
us district and it was certified
in two different fonts so all of
this to say that the
reconciliation process created
overall favorable change twenty
four million dollars.
And I stand for questions.
That's
that's the good news but then as
director.
Extra twenty four million that's
available.
Thank you thank you.
Appreciate all the summary of
findings.
We were also charged with coming
up with some recommendations
for.
Hi Mr chair Mr Burciaga whenever
defer to discuss yes she has
that so Mr Chairman Mr Burciaga
can we preserve it has.
Mr Matthews our new CFO and what
we're gonna do is and I've got
myself a list here.
We're going to create streamline
and document internal processes
we're going to continue close
collaboration with the field
department and the of the
to have our budget and the state
board of finance work together
going to a monthly
reconciliation process internal
spreadsheets we share the board
of finance would create
separation of duties for double
checks
we also going to have our
internal tracking.
Program which is called the
builder speak to share so we
started those conversations so
that is not a human error in the
middle and we're going to
estimate on sick patients and we
certifications to state board of
finance in the timely manner and
additionally we're going to have
a CFO and we're asking this from
out to come on board as well to
help so the two that can balance
each.
Other questions.
Where is the twenty four million
in the financial.
It.
Mr Chairman director at the
start of this.
So.
In the next meeting hello how do
you think would come into the.
I suppose.
Yeah I would come into play.
Several years.
At.
Also this step in Mr chair strip
director Abbey.
We're gonna go over the we
certifications where you can see
the details with that form of
and so it is reflected in each.
Individual line item on the
financial plan that's the chair
back to.
Page.
Again these are over multiple
years so we will be specific as
to which line item by line item
twenty five through thirty
three.
When we just made those
adjustments we made those
adjustments to each project on
the timeline of the financial
planners you this is linked to
the data points of the financial
when those adjustments were made
they were made to that piece of
the financial.
Thank you for to page.
Let's go to page maybe thirteen.
It was a project that needed an
adjustment.
It is reflected.
On page thirteen.
Yes that that needed to be made
for the land first in line.
To.
Yes it would have been made in
this line.
So that it would have linked up
to the financial.
It's not obvious to me that.
Twenty four million.
There were.
Doesn't mean.
We were understated what else
to give means it is in the
process of reckons.
Your efforts reconciled.
Your coach to share.
But not necessarily to the
financial plan.
What I.
Representative was to bonds
bonds support.
You reconcile our records for
finance but our financial plan
that had yet to difference
records.
Thank you it balances which we
true.
In this budget plan as well when
we do the recertification you'll
see the detail to each of that
that makes up the.
But I understand it correctly
having a little bit.
That those amounts spread out
throughout the school years well
the total amount to that much.
That is correct whatever it is
when you come back with.
What what will that work be
completed reconciling these
adjustments to next meeting with
Mister chair members in
discussion we were thinking that
we would.
Completely done by July one.
Well it whatever it is I think
it's important to do a
reconciliation.
Just like you the.
Here which is to share you're
going to get a new financial
plan I think that save code to
to the I guess I'll be
surprised.
Okay thank you.
Keeping up with.
For but she.
Ely based on on.
Representative do with your
phone.
We talked about awards about
whether this could be
reconciliation worksheet the.
But look at it we look because
that's the flared up record.
Is there.
The of the proposed worksheet
that we chose to build that
everyone.
Yes but.
Miss Mister chair director Abbey
we do have way spreadsheet.
To the council right now is to
be formatted so that its not
everywhere just to meet your
needs.
So that's what we'll see what.
That also in a discussion of the
works but the importance of the
council.
Mr chair director at the also
keep in mind we do have the
reconciliations our worksheets
per bond
is that helpful is there
something more.
In addition you want to see
based on that worksheet.
Mr chair members you'll see some
of those we get to item three
see what they look like.
Sorry what to wear items we see
which is the next item on the
agenda.
involved.
Report forty two yeah I yeah it
is and I don't.
Again your efforts was making
sure the funds certifications
recording was accurate.
And then of the spinach.
Mr chair members we have to
connect each project food eco to
the bond so it it does have a
connection
Funds are connected to the
financial plan you'll note that
the financial plan now has the
funds whose rate with each part.
Mr chair director happy the
spreadsheet in question that.
want to see I have a chip which
I have been.
Issue worksheets that I will be
presented to you today as well
and my high level every single
bond we have that expanding that
matches state board of finance
as well as the spread sheet the
spreadsheet includes a code
switch connects to share which
houses has these projects in
budget they've been budget
director the.
A code even been established
Is the project complete does it
are there any options.
Need for the certifications and
so forth so I have a triple
check I will.
That spreadsheet to you if you
request that will.
What these down to words.
It's P. what's that.
Thank you yes this systems.
Chair members of one of the Mr
chairman members what what thank
you Jenny fourteen.
That to us so with the S. co the
efficacy of different letter so
we use those no letters and
numbers that are generated from
our field department for their
project.
This.
On the first line of CAS dash
nineteen zero seven
the project number the builder
which is our internal tracking
system we use that number to
create our account number if you
will in share so that we can
track it the builder we
contracted share and then you
can also track it with the bond
series so you'll see access to
the eighteen.
When we have these traced to our
financial system to our internal
tracking system which is a
construction piece as well as
far funding source which is our
one.
Everything ties.
At.
I asked at the last meeting why
the auditor to.
Find these issues.
Mr Mr chair after having what I
did notice as you went over the
audit findings is it indicated
that there was no reconciliation
done.
So without that reconciliation
they could see that.
Nothing to be done because at
the end of the day there was no
reconciliation.
What would be able to find the
point out that the ability to
provide.
Rate this page.
Thank you.
You use.
Should the words of the jobs of
the work to.
Through this.
I want to repeat that I think we
tried but.
It's like.
You're right to point what we.
Numbers are this is.
Get to that point.
C..
Mr chair comes to the.
The committee.
Or to to improve resolution
notification certification issue
resolution of eight of proceeds
as follows thirty with fifteen
may two SSD B. twenty one S..
To should should.
All right Mr chair members
you'll find that the you have
the
This information three C. is in
a small binder next you and it's
not it looks.
We've got what one needs to you
and.
It's in the books now.
I'm sorry Mr Cherokee and I
misspoke the books have been
replaced but for the people
online we email them the new I'm
packet so it's item three C. in
works right Cassie.
Mr chair members this is a
humiliation we certifications
based on the reconciliation and
I will ask you if you want me to
go through this in detail can
read off to you or if you want
to review of have to review it
have any questions this is
basically.
So finding.
To take.
The two of them so we all of
these are ones that.
Mr chair members.
For the first fund series as TV
fifty eight there were three
items that are discovered where
is our three less Vegas was the
news we're wanting to chew up to
the actual award and create an
audit trail for this so.
If you notice and forgive me I
don't have the page for the
reconciliation worksheet on
this.
So.
Right.
There's no page number but if
you notice there is a
reconciliation worksheet.
There is earmarked an amount for
system systems application
second round and there's a walk
number.
When you make the actual award
is when we need to recertify for
that particular project that was
not done for these three
projects so it did not
impact the bond balance because
there was already earmarked but
we needed.
Hi the requesting state forty
finance wanted to see the detail
for each project.
If you have any questions
regarding that.
But that's what we're doing with
these three particular.
So these are.
Next page are read so we're not
in red in the.
Increase.
So as I mentioned before yes TP
fifteen and there was no impact
on the fund balance.
And with that you'll see the
resolution.
as well as the.
Worksheet.
Next one is this is the best B..
We are requesting to.
K. five two hundred eighteen
thousand one nineteen because
office that needed to be
applied.
we see a valley leadership
account account I mean that
award was rescinded so we needed
to free up that those hi dollars
and then we needed to chew up
the.
The fans or third.
That created an available
balance in that bond the four
hundred eighty one thousand
thirty seven dollars.
So you'll see more of this.
Discovery in these requests for
re certification.
Just to be clear.
We.
Heading to do with this right
all of our to the Mr chair
members.
This is our lack of things.
Chair members and if you have
any questions.
As well as.
So it.
Las Vegas most of the others.
But the.
Representative for six year of
the state and listening.
Is that.
Mr chair after having to go back
and look at their overall
picture I don't.
The two different schools of the
state.
Two different schools in the.
Chair Abby.
Asked I see.
Two eighteen one one nine first
year of the staff into twenty
eight one eighty nine for the
state.
And then the.
What.
There are different.
Thank you.
So if we.
So is also required for each
year of this to.
With that being the charge to
office that serves this
Representative.
That gives question is that it
didn't affect.
This but I would like my
question was.
But it's also.
Probably was.
Was it calculates.
The work was with the.
When we certify the gross about
at the end of a.
Mr chair director Avid again go
back to that project.
Thank you.
I have looked over.
Multiple projects.
Over multiple fiscal year that
unfortunately I couldn't tell
you the specifics on this.
To.
What part of the part of today's
regional.
Mr chair that that the that is
correct.
Keep in mind sure you all.
They ever getting to discover
Representative well it'll this.
Thank you.
Over here I could barely work
So how did we work closely with
hiring.
Is that they do
we do is one on one meeting I
had to go over each of the.
Yes reserve officials that part
of finance had initially
identified its potential that
they don't we would take part
over education and we track
those through.
She identify with of these that
I what we started out with and
what she Prof hi actually was
reflected in the need to be
verification so we had a thank
you for money at that number if
the policy I will be back on
that Representative started I
want to say.
For the vote how we work on
those I mean thank you
individually one on one with I
realize that her team I hope
this then through that work I
really had been going through at
work at the verification.
The crew will be but that did
not come to work finance I have
been tracking that awhile.
I have we've been working one on
one with the higher the thank
you for finance individual.
what they are seeing across
there the original monster
Education and that Hinesville
for each reader whether you
left or did not provide further
information
the station where I was
presenting this information
today.
And just the board of finance
have to approve these.
Have to approve any reserve
vacation when either.
We the funding of the particular
project that wasn't regional we
identified on their vacation so
if there is additional funding
is needed for project and what
was originally I guess that
those.
And it's like a new project is
that as of on that was not
originally and the date on get
over that and the fact they have
I feel that would not identified
on that
we hop within the app on your
budget of the verify Act funding
department tracking at this
point eight thousand necessarily
have to come for finance but it
is the practice for staff here
you know it's not you know fifty
million for the nation we
verified and only one thing I
really needed to the practice
he.
Thousand if they didn't know
that that is available for
another used you know what we
think would be that that
happened that that you.
For the work of that five
hundred thousand for example
have a new purpose and then
again is that the new purpose or
anything I think that would work
fine so really what I'm looking
or feeling is it is you know a
really attractive and would come
to act.
I have an increase on a
particular project as far as and
I'm advocating for a would add
a new project we're into the
main office of the board of
finance and then we actually and
have our bond from here and then
the regulations are work at that
correctly and accurately
reflect.
All of the very.
So Mister leach can you tell
looking at these documents which
company which you need to take
to the board of.
We will be able to look at those
and review them the gentleman
what would be requested after.
You know the name of the.
The certification we will
necessarily have to take that
support all the week eight do
that need to be out of the it's
probably not necessary but it
could be something that would be
good practice for a line item
number
but we we what what I really the
pair of what's in the package
for up to date the legislative
information we need to determine
what would require large part.
Thank you that is.
Early change or not.
Thank you.
What I reinforced right now is
routine it.
Ring at over the last couple
years
I think prior to that it was
very routine and
believe that that would be to be
repair thank you for for what I.
You know.
The
other thing required what we and
what not hi is there any is
there shown accurately and we
have acted for call tracking.
Thank you for the verification
your readers returning that we
contracted dollars that we need
to prepare the verification
they're very.
you know I would say we have
four in the last couple of years
and what I
thought the market for global
health is worth million for the
for the vacation I mean the
board
but they are internet I think as
long as we can easily tracked
Act funding from.
On three occasions through the
re verification is the fact that
that.
Really and then.
We're working to do that because
what was happening that would
not otherwise the third Asian
for twelve to get to the level
that knocked me to the point of
that needed it and we don't have
any mentors hard work to get the
exact fit for that.
These matters really last thing
required federated invocation we
verification wealthy.
I like it that's a fact now we
need the moment you know the
council that the identify twenty
whether or not that that you
know what out of the new I thank
you that they have had no
mechanism I know that something
figured out.
If any work right now so for
work that he's done and I think
I continue we were very close to
the rate that they are the
impact of the not that we're
working in the act that exactly.
I think if we continue with that
work for all of those.
Three charters.
Of the.
closed.
At.
House buying the.
Last four increase in state
chair.
D. was.
And housing needs to sign phase
for funding.
The broadband program category
to a network works yes.
Point to actually.
Increases our all state awards
about four hundred fifty
thousand.
Finally of.
I will.
Okay.
Those are the items on the
agenda.
Or should.
Yeah take a question is asked.
Requirements the part where it
was an increase of.
Twenty four thousand the total.
At the end of.
I would have the pre K. briefly.
See that's
But the note in there.
Says that we Rancho applied
backed off.
They're shining star.
Because they could not for the
office that.
Just cut a program.
Kind of issue that relates to my
complex.
You know your intro as.
A waiting list of hundreds to
participate in pre K..
You know this is.
High priority for the state to
boost participation pre K. we
have a lot of.
And they're not participate so
what words.
She wanted to work properly of
the ways we need to address kids
separately at this point when I
went to this school you for
school I think the reserve.
R. participated for lack of
spaces so the it gets so much
for.
Sure.
It's time to look.
Questions.
Mr Burciaga to.
In the.
Hi.
Most.
I just want to the.
Thousand.
For the work site.
The
For some.
I think this is information was
true.
I'm Mr chair members it likely
sponsor programs manager to.
This.
Mr chairman members this is an
informational item of to go over
the pre applications received
just remember the final ranking
in the applications were
released January eleven months
ago and this year we've changed
the process of the applications
will remain open throughout the
entire year to allow districts
to apply at any time the pre
application process has also
been changed to consist of the
districts submitting a letter of
intent.
and then following that PS they
will work in those districts on
the final application the
eligibility for standards as the
top one fifty or just the I grew
the seventies systems of the top
three fifty or and FCA over
seventy our system they didn't
find category one two or three
in the fan or demolition of any
abandoned facilities in pre K.
is eligible for all systems I'm
sorry well disabilities
The appropriation received thus
far far as follows standards
Farmington has submitted for
heights middle school in mesa
Verde elementary school
Albuquerque sign language
academy has submitted for
standards based replacement.
Systems based we have Springer
middle school slash high school
combined school for roofing.
Tularosa has submitted for the
elementary school for H. fax in
a
Thanks for each district.
It is this is this was stating
that we are in the process of
talking with several other
districts about applying.
Getting ready for them to apply
in the near future hopefully.
There are more coming down the
pike.
With that Mr chair we stand for
any questions.
Okay.
We will work to sign language.
We have a we.
That work Mr chairman Mr have
you we're working on that we
just realized been informed that
the sign language academy is
part of the APS Fund and so
we're currently researching.
We haven't made any
determinations with.
Ordinarily we look in a way
we're with the additional.
The district qualifiers for
statute which does not qualify
for.
We.
Mr chair your reserves.
Thank all those that realize
that.
All along but there's it is
quite unique.
To have to take that.
Sources.
To the calculation.
This is.
So so just to summarize what we
stated.
We've got local veteran fifty
four.
But that local search.
Waiver request the fifty four.
Really.
All the applications yes.
What were some of the part of
this this this this look at just
the creases okay.
To the.
Many applications in the few
little collection Farmington
clash with the betting many
schools of Farmington with that
now I guess the come to a
hundred percent.
Yes the realtor.
That.
Working with.
It just raises a lot of equity
issues does.
Thank you Mr just for the.
Hasn't charter schools in the
past requested a waiver for this
is the first.
Mr chair and Dr drive.
Okay sign language in particular
has requested waivers multiple
times for the same.
The patient however we were not
aware at the time that they were
part of the APS long so they've
requested several times.
And I'm Mr chair Dr Parker this
is the the first year okay thank
you very.
The other questions.
What do you know as APS how
much.
This page is there for.
It's it's nice to say were there
on that.
Thousand dollars in two thousand
ten million dollar project that
doesn't get very far down the
road we know how much is in and
the timing of that.
Is that.
This year next year the twenty
twenty six possible.
Mr chairman Mr Robbins we
received a packet of their
information this is a small
fraction of the PS one obviously
I don't.
So theoretically they could get
fifty thousand.
Eligible for a seventeen million
dollar.
Representative the which.
What what what does that there
Representative sure.
They have.
Torrez Sir are you doing.
Your.
State property transaction state
structures so that yes well
years ago years ago if you just
options.
Yes join in Representative so we
got personal our.
Recent waiver.
Is.
Local match up.
Yes Representative percent.
So.
So so this.
For this service which is kept.
Never.
so what happens is that right.
The state of.
This is rolled.
This.
Severities street
so that's what we're working
with them.
For
assistance with.
But.
It is so rewarding job loss
effects we've we've actually
predictable.
So Representative res this well
I.
That is really.
I was able to show over this and
we will be hello
It's very lost.
So it's possible.
Four years but again would like
to comments of a sexual
supported.
This one.
Definitely.
Thanks for.
But sure our question is the the
real weapons is very low
because.
The seventh.
Both the capacity.
If I may.
Students are currently attending
and where are they coming from.
So Mr.
There is approximately a hundred
and sixty students per.
What the sixties us to do this.
Of the region there's some of
you do.
Supplementals and services from
different question it is up.
K. to twelfth also judges give
us some of those factors are
have reached this reference also
so you're welcome to do that to
a lot.
so that region but secretary.
Direction this is a whole.
Thank you very much for.
Also want to look at it what are
noted here given this rose as
director of IT whether you were
so it's just lost.
This is to do that without the
special.
Region because students so again
as of the six computer.
Yes.
Right now.
Three of the sales because of
that we.
Also for high schools and basis
so.
Churches.
This.
So because the need
is Representative.
All.
So are you working with
conference via UPS.
This is one of the standards.
Districts.
For.
Get additional SCG for operating
losses hello hi.
Special at this age don't get
the vision of this assistance
and that's one thing we're if
you have a school that is a
sixty to seventy percent off on
it I.
Roughly sixty seven percent of
the students have.
That was a severity.
they need adequate space a
district school by
would would probably at the want
to this.
But it was actually that was
help.
Students.
Have to live.
But the charters don't have a
resources it wouldn't changes
the legislature made I
appreciate the changes that at
ten thousand dollars.
they don't have the wherewithal
Act for two million dollars.
Back so this is one of the
things when we look at special
needs students in the state.
At risk not necessarily a
populations or all it was
language learners they are
language.
If I were to sign but this is
one of the gaps that we have in
the funding formula in our own
rules of how we account for
these students and I visited the
school.
The end of the year they're
doing an incredible job with.
I would like to see.
What we can to try to find ways
within the law in a lot of that.
To allow the school to do more
so these kids don't have to be
sent off to a dormitory Santa Fe
because a lot of these parents
want to have the kids at home in
the one of the with the board of
regents they don't want to send
them off of the end of the you
know that that is really the
only alternative.
Parents have.
Mr chair of the if this actions
those of law students are
supposed to officers have
Representative president of
course our teachers a lot of
our teachers are actually
addition Representative some
changes and so the decision.
On teachers.
Shares of there's a lot more
than just that we also work
Education mess.
The the so so this was very.
So
This is a life.
C. additional questions.
Addicts or I see here that
we're.
Process than this in the form.
Y. eight.
Mr chair the work Clinton when
that we approved.
January December
and it was decided that the
system is based Board quarterly
so those will happen in April
July October January in the
standards of pre K. will be
finally in July it J..
But for this past year we're
looking at June and July yes.
Actually Mr chair the systems
based will be coming in April.
For the two of Representative
and potentially Springer.
All right.
Thank you.
One.
US federal funding request.
So.
This.
This these.
Every.
Mr chairman members the workshop
committee recommends.
For oil
Funding chair of the state that
you're three million five
hundred seventy one hundred
twenty two dollars a hundred
percent of local that you zero.
Approval is contingent upon the
district utilizing the districts
available what the capacity
prior to returning to P. SCO C.
for upside construction for the.
Your some of the.
Mr chair members I would like to
add and I would also like to
indicate the superintendent and
his business manager are in the
audience.
so Mister chair members the
district has requested a waiver
for three point three million
local maps for the the awarded
design phase funding.
staff recommends granting the
waiver for the local match for
an increase the state match of
three point three for the design
phase.
the reason that we support this
is the district meet the
criteria for a waiver of the
local match in January the PS
CYFD awarded the design phase
funding at the current state
match of two hundred fourteen
thousand three hundred and
fifteen and local match of the
three point.
Mr chair members if you turn to
page two forty five.
This is it this is the waiver
This is what makes them eligible
for the waiver and the center of
page two forty five conceded
that ma'am counties equal or
less than a hundred
the percent of free and reduced
lunches seventy percent or
greater it's actually a hundred
percent the state shares less
than fifty percent and the mill
levy is equal to or greater than
seven and the district is seven
point five
at the top of the page Mr
chairman members you'll see
there the cash balance for the
operational five point eight six
of eight percent of the
operational budget.
Which is two point five million.
Eight three.
Thousand in SB nine ninety seven
thousand in fines total cash
three hundred thirty thousand.
And again the amount to the
waiver requests three point five
and we were requests to percent
of all cash balances a hundred
and one thousand sixteen point
thirty nine percent.
So Mr chair members.
That's all I have to admit to
having the movie.
What to call those transaction.
As well.
Mr Chairman
thank you for having us here
today.
Hello thank you for being here.
New Mexico senators also start
by to a lot.
Thank you to all of the that we
have buildings that are all.
About the their lives.
We get our ability
back in the fall outside
committees most of our buildings
all it would take eighty five.
Percent to just bring up the
standards of the cost or
availability.
H. fax systems we have
up our our systems we have all
these things we hear the
situation where our activity bus
runs out of date this year is
the only have to be plus we have
districts on some other things
that would have to to work
towards to apply.
For small district will to
to raise the funds to the
matches and things like that
very challenging at least all I
have secretary to the with this
reserve rate for calendar this
is chair of the public more
finances here one of the things
we try to district is small
towns especially the school
districts all of you we're
trying to.
With our help.
In our students excited dollars.
Zachrich Mr.
Mr fortune.
We face a few of significant
challenges.
Right what we're looking at this
project to the biggest concerns
we have our.
The first which was the
recurring maintenance costs as
of eight.
During the construction phase we
will still need to maintain our
each fax systems
yes.
Cost two point eight million
dollars to a place.
they were able.
In addition to that the school
district is currently
Our bonding capacity is at the
limit that we can reach before
we increases.
That is a selling point is on
elections.
We're concerned that if we go
out for a larger amounts that
kind of one of the issue house
so.
Currently the most that we could
issue next tax year.
C. H..
Increases.
That was figure that one kids.
Right to this as well.
What is needed to.
Just last fall for six hundred
thousand all members of that.
We've got for you all state just
try to maintain the keeper of
our oceans all in the last three
months we've had three different
Water race all one of which
possible.
It is just great I see.
So we're concerned about costs
associated with the team.
we really want to pull out
Racial and as.
Have the schools and
in addition we have a.
So that's a big part.
To.
My question would be
Report of a contingency.
Yes Sir we we can't right so we
can do our our tax.
At twenty three one two is next
how can go full screen twenty
five.
Eight hundred.
What we can.
Right taxes are are are hi what
with the passing of.
On.
Get out of.
What is your total tax.
We we're currently with
comparable districts works.
Percentile is actually.
If you just want to have.
With that was
Districts.
But work with the need at least
seven at least.
I understand the tax base is
very large we're.
Whatever so.
And I and I understand I think
that's the minimum and you don't
have a large package which that
is.
We don't have a lot of
manufacturing and industrial of.
Years of our of our two biggest
all employments is the cat for
House in the school district
I just thought that was people
work out of town will to road.
Even that's now not the.
Trilok because.
Good.
Thank.
Questions St Paul just to
clarify the intent of the motion
was required to.
It just for background I think
the council has never granted a
waiver of in which the district
is using all of the for us I
just
takes you about this.
That's the intent of this motion
which is different than so we we
can we can go for ages are are.
Also the reason why state what
we say is that the the ability
to passes.
Basically if we're able to the
other and then we have money to
put their doesn't pass we have
that and that's a lot of Houston
is
That's where the motion is we
you know we can do that but.
Basically the this motion
request you to texture cells it
fact a million dollars over and
years to get thirty five
million.
That's a pretty nice this is
true green no absolutely.
So I.
I don't think it's a matter of
just trying to say you tried I
think it's.
So I.
And I think it was important to
try to hold up you know when the
match is so favorable to hold up
a design phase one knowing you
can't with that quickly to get a
bond issue.
But I'm again I'm gonna repeat
that.
Just as with the require I and
I'm pretty sure I just double
check we do have our tickets
that we we have our our waiver
for districts that were less
than a hundred percent one.
You can.
You will be.
Well and that's another point by
the way the request of the words
of the committee was to come
back with.
You know we've got a fleet of
the really this idea was we
should be doing more waivers and
so we have a policy in place but
again historically I think that
where we.
Stations we covered that Mr
president.
Yes we you're you're the
president of the possibility
good.
Business manager is.
So so the outcome of that yes we
can of the questions we will
find the right hours and with
good reason tax for.
Two thousand twenty three years
ago all my question to you is is
of work hello we have that we
have the
All of us to live through the
for things that we had we're
waiting to hear from insurance
right now and then just
insurance money that's from the
it help us reach that million
dollars all.
Possibly we don't know what the
amount is you have to wait to
hear but we do know the only
talking about because we had a
high school the targeting yield
that flooded at ninety six
thousand gallons of water.
Also for publication table four
we had three issue since there
was some of that money is cap
would replace things were
destroyed some of the
we anticipate some might phone
because we're not going
hopefully that will be using
that building I towards of four
so I think that this another way
to help tribal dollars read a
little more our issue that.
It looks like capacity four
point three million less well
off to ask you to raise to get
through.
Mexico.
With the strategy building you
want to pass that you don't want
to deal with.
And.
I think of.
Take a look at this.
I just wanted so as the equity
issue let's get.
Were you for the support well
for all of last year a last job
will last on the recount
Joffrey's that is repulsive
twenty two years and then I went
to Texas for a couple years ago
I.
So you know corona of course I
think they're bonded to zero.
Voters in about the same shape
as you are.
Both.
Letter of equity you know we've
got Corona can't Thomas.
Given all ten percent of the
cost.
You are in a position to get are
you aware of the state to cover.
That's why the strictly this
under percent I believe it's
pretty are the fast which
I like.
It was retained with us forces
thank you.
In our lives.
Go ahead.
I think you need thousand use of
other needs.
What I believe Mr Abbey is
saying the state the council
expects the citizens tribute the
amount that would be at least
the seventh bill let the full
market basket at seven meals.
It won't increase the taxes be
on seven mills we're not asking
for the on the seven that we are
asking the committee to do that
in order to get over thirty
million dollars.
Please let us to achieve our
that's.
That's part.
At present.
So yes it could require taxed.
But I would that's a given
thirty five days right.
Axing one point three million
rotation thousand tunes not all
right so voters I think that's.
So your body capacity right now
is one point three million.
Yes I used okay.
The motion and that motion is is
that not that it's just a
hundred thousand I I agree that
we should ask that you go for
bonding capacity up to the seven
mills and that's one point three
million I would agree with that
I agree with the motion.
State right now otherwise it is
an equity issue for other
districts like I deal with
insurer sectors detected yeah
bonded so you'll have a higher
ability in order to provide for
the pair's thank you they need
to and they're willing to do
that I understand the tax base
as well this will help that is a
well threshold people really
want there's choose to the.
Education and adequate
facilities.
Yes.
And you want to make sure you
got that I was in high.
Yes.
Will be reported thank.
Next item is the.
The Roman rule seven for the
business.
Very much related.
In this update.
Speculative these.
Follow up with.
In addition from the awards are
so stark.
Shares of reckons the council
approved up options statewide
education technology network
guidelines it was presented in
your post what education
network.
Educators and students all
connected to that.
The discussion.
What we Mr chair members can be
We have this one if you like you
order these draft guidelines
back in January fourteenth
twenty twenty two and leave you
so the guidelines in front of
you to do.
Are based on Senate bill one
forty four with the council so
developed guidelines for the
statewide education technology
infrastructure network
that indicates a regional have
locations for network services
and installation and maintenance
and equipment the key point are
that the guidelines are
technology neutral.
Is that minimum requirements for
the statewide education sister
network and the also will we be
reviewed at least annually as
needed and if you want to see
the actual guidelines here page
two fifty seven.
And.
The technical specifications for
the guidelines are in the center
of page two fifty eight with
that Mr Chairman.
We stand for any questions.
thank you Mr chair and thank you
both
I was not at the.
Amis me last time so I apologize
and have just look at this until
I talked to some of my staff.
And
I've got some.
Acklins with respect to.
I think this is an expansion of.
What the council can do so we go
through quickly because I know.
Under background the third
paragraph talks.
It's a prohibition for father
New Mexico broadband efforts
Representative backbone for just
being service which not only
supports students and teachers
and role underserved areas that
supports economic development
will public health telehealth
and Ag industry I don't think
that's covered anywhere in the
house bill one forty four and.
I think it would take that first
that paragraph of third with
curated the of schools.
That's what it's supposed to do.
that's what you know this
particular chapter of
section chapter of twenty to
twenty four well that's part of
the things we have a lovely Act.
Well I realize it's
and vicious or is this language
is ambitious and and.
It would be nice to to have that
kind of effort I think it's
going to need to do this go but
I know that I think the
substantial disco not certain
about that so similarly on goals
first goal at
all the traditional stations is
also name drugs I think that
should be limited to K. through
twelve public schools.
On the third what I'm not sure
what it means by state
eliminating that.
Gap.
Sure it says providing internet
access to all New Mexico
students and educators were
everything worked the study I
think I understand that
attention but that I think that
should still be limited to New
Mexico public schools K. through
twelve.
General guidelines the first
general guidelines for screen it
should say.
improving collaboration Kate
twelve I think that's fine.
But
I'm not sure about tribal
because we don't have to
The state doesn't have
absolute control.
Of the tribes in in multi agency
collaboration that we leverage
resources to applications.
I'm not sure what it those
agencies are limited to school
school districts yes update at
Senator.
And I think that should be
education of the state well.
Not run that at this point
On the second page.
On the second page of technical
specifications.
number four.
Additional members added to the
network again.
It is not related to K. twelve
public schools looking route
said school opened
even though the some of these
made the state introduce a I
would want to focus first on.
On K. to twelfth include some
point there may be some.
Right to grieve to include other
networks actually we are open
networks other agencies but
K. to twelfth right first which
will be by adding anything
later.
So I'm not sure what new
participating members may be at
this point.
And then I have no idea what
seven eight I have no idea what
that would generate for packet
loss rate is so we have
something to do with response
time.
Definition.
On the next page I think we're
a prioritization of projects.
I don't know the two addresses
the schools moderate soon.
The school was at school
districts it is that food
charter students.
And
Mr Chairman was about the only
ones that I I.
By the.
Okay
on public space K. to twelfth
I think that's the intention of
sent over for review.
I know there's something the R.
P. that mentions expanding the
somewhat but
I'd rather just focus on K.
through twelve.
At some point see that can
really be expanded through this
mechanism to propose we have a
lot.
For additional statutory changes
required before we that is
Having staff the information
technology oversight committee
about thank you more go back to
more fifty years ago this is a
big thing of land rail this is
the thing to do never got off
the ground so some investors.
It's that.
Resurrected so I just like to
see something.
It's something that it's more
taxable than some of these some
of this
Language thank you.
Mr Burciaga week we discuss.
Take about what was coming
because we knew everything I
agree that.
Our.
Expiration aspirations thank you
they are aspirational but not
really appropriation.
And aspirational things hello we
say that yes I am for
legislative it is everything for
funding but I don't know if our
guidelines which is which.
State what is supposed to.
The comments we.
Mr Chairman Mr Burciaga I agree
with with your statements that
funding for the from this
council should not be utilized
for the aspirational
goals that are E. the that are
included here.
However I believe that it is
important to by the council to
to signal that there is an
openness to collaboration with
with other efforts utilizing
federal funding other state
funding and and so on and I'm
ready to to to talk a little bit
more about how these other
elements.
Can feed into in your life the
foundation that is established
by the state education four
specifically for public schools
in only for public schools and
the potential awards and the
funding from coming from the
council will solely be utilized
by that good it makes absolutely
no sense in this type of effort
in this type of work to create a
a note for the schools and
create a note for higher
education we create a note for
For supplying for helping the
expansion of broadband to
students to teachers at their
homes and such it makes only
sense to try to combine those
together you and there are
actually a current funded to
currently funded efforts in
place to assist with the
discovery and I'm ready to to
speak about about these efforts
in detail for example the notes
we're going to present in the
next items they are located at
higher education institutions in
the higher education
institutions already submitted
we budgetary requests to the
highway Department
for operates there are needed to
to to bring those know what's up
to specifications where they are
not only going to be ready to to
house equipment for up to to
connect the schools the public
schools together but also to
connect other to connect to
students at their homes
utilizing the private sectors
and so on so these aspirational
items I believe part only
signals to others in the state
that this work can be leveraged
buy out for for other prospects
if in other state priorities and
with relation to broadband if
additional funding
yes it is leveraged for for
those specific purposes Mr chair
Mr Burciaga I have a quick
comment I can certainly agree
with Senate bill one forty four
and I can I think that we
construct these comments maybe
pass it around to make sure we
capture them all and.
These will be the guidelines but
video can through conversation
another meetings talk about the
aspirations but these will
guidelines will adhere to Senate
bill one forty four.
Which is.
Is it.
If I may and I appreciate that I
think you're right.
Is you your program is now that
is also going to slow the one
about the size of talking with
the public all that is for the
state H.
with respect to broadband light
I think just because it was
interspersed here possibly some
concern if there was some.
noted the and it says based on.
Jurisdiction or something to
that effect that
this may allow for some kind of
collaboration with other
entities.
I provided that funding.
That is specific to this offer
purchases SB one.
Senator
Paypen I don't want to say we
never want to collaborate I just
didn't want it to be assuming
that.
This is all part of
the beginning so.
The
public
I stated at the end.
Is that.
Mr chair.
I think we think these are.
Guidelines for public education.
That doesn't mean that we are.
Seiling arsenal's.
The rest of the world well it.
Having.
In.
Means that it will work on rural
development for economic
development public health which
I agree there is a huge need.
That's not our place our place
that used to serve the students.
Students in New Mexico and
having the state and the answers
that we are open for discussions
for collaboration.
I suppose.
It.
Call into question.
That maybe the mid and the and
this.
Aspirational
but above so that we have.
Have a six yard work with
entities but to include this
aspirational we're putting those
aspirational items in order to
achieve economics and scale
faster service into we.
The network the network may
collaborate with not public
institutions so I think you know
we're on.
Public school.
That we're not publishing Act
that has been so the focus on
that as we for once but that we
also knowledge.
That.
Exasperation that this proves I.
Would you.
I will.
Yes state and what I said.
What
of those.
But that the M. as a committee
recommendation council approval
for adoption the state would
occasionally guidelines you have
it.
Mention this to this job.
Of course what it's patient
hello technology.
And would she economics scale
of the characters to achieve
economies of scale for
processors to the network maybe
I.
Their second.
Not all those in favor of.
These are the by a lot all
right.
Just as.
Want to the next available Mr
Chairman just to the point where
petition Mr chair so we'll make
these adjustments would you like
us to send the draft to all of
you and then go ahead and use
it.
The email.
We want to the second.
Just category.
What cope subcommittee
recommends to this of the staff
to accept this point coverage
options it turned to contract
negotiations for the fact well
last mile.
One of the servers.
Mr Chairman with with your
permission quickly I'd like to
introduce reintroduce the former
broadband team member Terry
Smith using the audience Mister
Smith this now the the property
manager for the county of Los
Alamos since December he's here
to to to to see the outcome for
for this
Long efforts over the last year
actually also I'd like to
introduce Thailand lives she is
replacing Mr Smith the end of
the
inexperienced electrical
engineer and experienced project
manager and she decided to come
back from retirement to assist
us with the work related to to
broadband in this network very
very complex.
The proposed motion.
With the allow approval of the
four ranking recommendations
from the three evaluations.
enter into negotiations with
these vendors out there are I
just for clarity there are three
sections in the current
procurement in those sections
the information on the sections
outcome of the the ranking this
committees start on page two
hundred sixty seven
the first section use commodity
internet
which in simple terms that means
connecting go up the ability to
connect all the participants to
the commercial internet.
Backbone
in means the creation of the
hops for the notes in connection
of the notes the pursuit
participating schools together.
the backbone also cop
facilitates network management
and cybersecurity assistance
similar activities last mile
that's not Representative a
little smile.
An entire connection between the
participating school board
district the network no
regardless of and that the light
up that up that circuit.
So quick points about this the
negotiations to agree to
confirm.
The participant the actual
participants.
This phase one pilot how did the
forty one potential top schools
who receive.
Also there were fifty six
schools including the in the
request for proposal the twenty
forty one PC pliable proposals
from the private industry.
The contract will be brought
back to council for final
approval once up once they are
negotiated the term for these
contracts the the typical term
is approximately three years
that that is the history
standards.
On page two hundred sixty six
you have.
Matt at the text.
how these networks which is why.
There are a number of nodes
That are distributed throughout
the state that those are the
blue
Squarish like
images in the center.
it is it is that is important to
note that the number of these
notes is is uncertain right now
until we we know how many
schools are going to participate
we need the notes for the
schools that are connected to
them however it is expected all
the proposed knows will be
needed for the future for future
phases because they have to be.
Spread throughout the state in
order to be close enough to the
schools in order to to be viable
from a technical perspective.
all the notes will be
interconnected utilizing the
same solution in order to
function properly.
And some of the notes related to
the conversation earlier some of
the notes may be essential for
other state broadband projects
For example there is currently
a.
Projects funded with your I mean
it is a collaboration between
PED early childhood higher
education
that's the funding is already in
place and all that all that
effort hinges on the Gallup
aggregation hopped it is located
at UNM Gallup.
And currently only SUNY schools
are connected to that note again
all these other efforts and on
the Gallup note being in
existence being there of being
created.
The estimate cost for one year
of service in phase one is
approximately three million
dollars plus tax
eight there is no you
infrastructure is owned by the
state.
This is one of the reasons why
the overall cost is relatively
modest.
Considering the number of steps
into the overall timing it will
be difficult to submit to the
right application this year
however the wi intends to submit
the right applications we end up
in the following years and we
will try will give our best to
to submit an application in this
year there is even the
possibility of cooperation.
it is difficult to compare the
current US post the right cost
of internet for schools with a
different better service to the
state education network pilot
without the right so so that is
the reason we
we don't believe that that the
schools are going to be able to
to to pay share it this year
however we our team is ready to
present models wear the schools
are going to participate have a
modest participation in the
overall cost here in the cost
for subsequent the range are you
a funded type project years.
In on page two hundred sixty
one.
The
Yes it is outlining that
contemplated so.
I.
Doing a position that is page
two hundred sixty one in a top
of the page
filling an existing project
manager manager position that is
already funded a new projects
coordinator financial specialist
it would be in your position.
the contract administrator to
support the procurements and
contracts because that effort is
significant robin is
hi I'd like to say as much the
procurement effort as it is that
the technology connect technical
effort.
And we also list the broadband
internet I would be under
contract we all also we're
contemplating cost sharing that
position or that the services
with the office of broadband
currently this is looking at
that hiring that type of
position that type of
person and we are coordinating
closely with the office of
broadband on this work and and
all the other future work that
that is this was it would
broadband throughout the state.
This these positions are we
believe necessary because the
statewide to cation network of
the work related to Senate bill
one forty four is pretty much
the full program in addition to
the current broadband projects
that we expect are going to
continue the category one and
category top to type projects
that the fund the the the
council has been funding for the
last seven years.
I want to make a comment there
on page two sixty one this is
the background that we presented
to you before and these are the
positions that we thought we
would need to make it successful
and we're not asking for any new
positions were just people
around internally but also it's
really important to state that
we need to collaborate with the
opposite I've been.
They take more involvement for
phase two it's it's quite
essential and and I just wanted
to make that comment the
supplemental materials as well
as if you look at exhibit eighty
we were asked to talk about the
anti donation clause and at that
time we thought we all fiber but
He process we discovered that we
would not own fiber yes Mr do we
communicated that's why the cost
is more.
They just wanted to point those
out.
Mr Chairman quickly thank you
director Chris yes up quickly in
in closing up beyond in
negotiations the next step would
include developing requirements
for up for work to make all the
components come together
that the network management we
we call it up completing the
negotiations contracting and
starting the implementation for
this phase one as well as
developing you right hello to
table procurement for face to to
add more schools to the testing
industry which position network
next year and possibly ten years
thereafter that is going to to
make the cost even more
affordable yes more schools are
sharing in two ways this
concludes the presentation Mr
chairman members of the council
and will try to to answer any
questions you may have.
The last two this in here.
The
The next steps that.
Yes.
This Mr Mr Chairman.
Members on page two sixty under
key points.
we talk about face to background
backbone thing vendor last mile.
You are the P. this is the
camber and this is based you
would be right I and
was one is a hundred percent
state.
K. to sixty.
Thank you.
Questions.
Mr chair I just want to disclose
one of the tools that is listed
in here we have my sister.
Mr chairman Mr Abbey requested a
summary of the RFP and that's on
page two seven right for your
information.
What
lessons of COVID district
thank you you Mr chairman and
Mister Roberts for working with
the staff.
It really hard for me to wrap my
arms.
On what it is.
Clear.
Responsive page for these types
of where.
Thank you specialist Roberts and
I I think these key points are
important for about four.
This is phase one without E.
right.
Russia will.
Get this done quickly.
Chief about the.
Well I was.
Is that was yes Representative.
Job title that just programs we
clear that coming back.
there are few.
Some of.
The world.
Correct.
Meeting of the participating.
Those what coverage and then I
guess finally I I pushed hard of
cost sharing that I think.
Of the did a good job twenty one
that was feasible the stage of
the contest these were the
future at the guidelines allow
for the question.
The just.
But you promise and thank you
the two chairs subcommittee
chairs for collaborating on.
Come up came up with the.
Part of the but all the time
that the problem.
All the servers.
Place we were.
In the year sort of a question
mark.
Are all these.
So.
For the motion on this.
For.
I was in favor of approved
recommendations.
Both.
Right.
Thank you.
Thank you for all your work and
also if you were.
Thank you Mr chairman because.
So we've got for makes a lot of
those couple of these want to is
there there's any that we can.
As you wish.
Mr chair members.
What are the our audit report.
The brief update an unrestricted
revenue processing payments
would be the thing I would like
to present and then we have
time.
Worked.
This there's a different
desire of the council what.
So the prices improvement is so
you know we started to over the
last direction we had from you
was to hire an external vendor
to work with us we now have her
under contract and I believe
she's waiting for me to call
tomorrow to set the initial days
so we should.
And the I'm.
Gosh.
Is there I thought I heard you
say that now
Checking in director Avid I
didn't see her name
I do a complete thank.
Will come to you but it's she's
not present today no Mr chair
members she's not is an
organization that works within
the state before it passes into.
We.
And I'm sure she's the vendor
for the process approval for the
president to be.
Mr chair director Avid you
remember you wanted to have
outside lines that you so we've
been working with the districts
have been working with
contractors and architects and
the in summary the COVID
recommendations from all three
groups they want to see
simplification consistency
expiation projects.
Direction part time dreams with
our review and our approvals
removal of redundancies a
stakeholder training.
Trying to piece of fan PSUC and
staff trained and then the other
common thread we heard was a
policy change for updates to the
adequacy standards how assets
are dressed in state Collett
state local maps formula.
So that's a brief summary of
everything and you'll find in
your notebook here are the
remaining minutes of each group
that we met with the and we plan
to meet with them again the
districts I mean the architects
and contractors semi annually
and the districts quarterly.
All would like to meet together
but we're going to see how that
works you have it goes and will
report back each time every time
we met with the architects the
contractors and the districts
we've we've given the minutes
from the meeting that's a very
brief summary Mr chair members a
staff person.
Eight four.
The question at the districts.
It's not the.
The long term.
Quality process.
Your chair members the name of
the consultant for companies PAM
solutions and her name is
Felicia Ortiz.
On page two so before policy
change I'm sure that waivers.
Mr chair representative maybe
just comment we agree with that
but we just didn't hear it in
the meeting that's what was in
here but it is on our.
Thank.
Mr chair members the other item
is on page two ninety four and
it's regarding unrestricted
revenue update.
Back in October you assigned is
the task of facilitating with
various districts regarding a
definition for unrestricted
revenue.
We had three separate meetings.
And on March first we received a
potential definition it's in the
middle of the page and the
confusion was.
What can be used for or what it
cannot be used for into clearly
defined that so the definition
and
talks about use of capital
expenditures and how they
defined as not budget is passed
as operational expenditures.
Expenditures made in the
building construction prior to
the adequacy standards and
projects of the PSUC will not
fund.
So I spoke to
Mr remind who provided me with
this as a result of the meeting
and I said we need to have
another meeting because I'm not
too clear on the definition so
we plan to meet on the week of
March twenty eight because this
isn't clear to me and we'll
bring that.
More we provide information to
the subcommittee meeting.
Due to the time I can go further
or I can stand for any
questions.
Mr chair members I'm sorry to
rescue both of those items
process improvement to something
that we're really chewing.
The.
What this so.
What.
Adhoc for people shortages show
up.
Mr chair there are important for
you to use this.
Mr chair Dr correct.
Just I guess like.
Dispatched I.
It's very much.
If
the policy issues were what are
the trade war.
How losses are dressed state.
Service.
That.
That she lied will reduction we
should be proud to.
Hello ways to this policy issues
and processes.
I just want to formalize.
And I don't see some of the
items that you're talking about
this as process issues.
I agree but that's why you come
to Brussels.
Representative postage.
Streamlining policy.
We need to come together as a.
As a council.
Point see if.
Yeah.
It the feeling of the support
from.
Because I'm sure that.
We support.
But it's a matter of how far we
will go to.
To.
Point are set up.
Expectations the council.
Well I agree with that so it's
almost like back to the process
said perfect tennis policy
changes very.
So.
You know for example update to
the.
The
issue.
One or the other we.
What sort of and we need to.
Discussion going on.
To get us to go out.
Mr chair that would comment or
question in particular asking
history subcommittee.
Dealing specifically with units
restricted revenue was gonna
responsible for coming up with
that definition the reason I ask
is I think it's good that we
have and I talk whatever and
getting feedback from school
districts to the point where
stakeholders but at the end of
the day when that definitions
establish it's gonna have a huge
effect on how to calculate the
offset for these impact Aid
school districts so I think
that's a very important that we
need to keep on our radar.
A lot of school of are you using
that.
What purpose.
Mr chair members the purpose of
the definition was to talk
about.
So the unrestricted revenue is
now going to go into the formula
for you have your
assist land valuations and then
you can add in unrestricted
revenue at that can be used for
capital expenditures so it's
going to.
Give a source of funding to
certain districts.
So Mister chair and Mr teas.
What I think I'm hearing from
this committee is we should rate
the policy from the process
improvement and kind of let you
know what items you're gonna
bring forced approval task force
in at that time creating
committee of appointed persons
and then we
Figure out who's going to
actually have this recognition
for the unrestricted revenue.
Just for clarification you said
that.
Representative mentions I
solution funding this.
Funding is sourced for
offsetting.
Necessary.
So Mister chair Mister Robbins
that's one of the questions that
we went round and round about
but we believe it's a source of
funding and the districts.
We're concerned they would talk
would be used as an offset.
Right it is not a source.
Read it for I.
Wait is that issues here.
And the mystery of the five
million dollars.
At.
That.
That appropriation state for
that.
Those are.
This
is a by the this of course.
Or
yes.
School budget.
It actually use other funding
for school projects.
To cover their offsets we're
also with that.
So I got two million dollars.
And they used for.
Practical.
As part of the expanded.
Even though that's a source of
funding.
That would.
Mister chair Mister Robbins the
conversation was more that the
unrestricted revenue it was used
for a nine PAC you see funded
project it would not count as an
offset when they come forward
for project.
Which is I think a little bit.
Different from what you're
saying it's it's a more basic
Google level they were talking
about getting a ten million
dollars.
From a different source.
And then having that be not be
announced it was only the.
Unrestricted revenue that they
were.
Wanting to not be enough said if
it was used for educational
purposes.
I want to
share with.
The requirement for the session.
So we have it would have a full
understanding of what this
definition.
And and Mister chair Mister
Robbins.
We got it on the.
March first and I did call and
say this needs more clarity more
discussion.
Mr chair members that takes us
to the audit report.
And again just the key points
this is on page three twenty
four we had I did my I'm modify
Nunes we had to findings
material witness and the
findings are little pages sixty
eight and sixty nine of the hi
it which are really page.
Three ninety three K. three
ninety four in your book.
And so the finding was that
close out procedures are not
performed and timely manner
adjustments to try balances
necessary reconciliations not
provided to the auditor
individual budgets not
reconciled include compensation
report late so you'll see that
we rest our solutions to each of
those findings.
I'm.
One of them was received in
person and written training from
DFA regarding processes and
submissions required for
submitting budgets.
We sat out training from the
past CFO regarding our processes
and those were forty two Mr Brad
Matthews as well as miss iris
Romero
we hired a financial contractor
to assist with bonding project
reconciliations.
Will establish in here to
written close out procedures.
And will implement additional
controls regarding journal
entries and project
participation worksheets.
I was an awful finding number
two was were performed prior to
yield building in place.
And that solution is very
simple.
We simply won't do that.
you'll find exhibit a is a
letter from the auditor and it
will be is the piece of art.
With that Mr chairman members a
stand for any questions you
might have regarding audit.
Strong institutional Committee
look at.
Yes.
Look at this as I stated.
Since this was and is to to say
are.
I was part of the accident
we're.
We're
in which brought.
so we did discuss this.
Acceptance of the audit by the
state are in this country and
with the
It
is this the first year this
company has been the case of a
audits.
The.
Mr.
Mr chair Dr Hawker the they have
done in the past at least three
years.
The HSD responses.
Mr chair that's correct.
Thank you.
Mr chair members.
Is there any other action
informational items that you'd
like to choose to hear about.
Any other.
Information.
Mr chair members there's the
mental status report
which wants to.
And after that we need to I
think the H. R. standing for.
That Mr chair members of the
council.
But the
good news for maintenance
program in the state of New
Mexico is returning back to the
COVID numbers which is very
exciting our preventive
maintenance plan status little
bit of a dive this last quarter
but none the less still
progressing and they're very
good like the better direction
currently fifties for fifty six
percent of our New Mexico school
districts in programs our
current.
Pressing the others to progress
to current.
As we speak FINS is also taking
a good direction of much better
direction districts are
rebounding in a much better
direction
Go back to pre comment numbers
it is progressing or excited to
see that coming back
Yes more market a primary
measure of maintenance New
Mexico which includes PM
planning films and a school
districts like the settlement
those numbers are very promising
and much better than previous
cycles we're getting ready for
the next cycle next month's
which we are going to push the
envelope with our New Mexico
school districts districts to do
