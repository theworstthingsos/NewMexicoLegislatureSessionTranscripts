Or House Bill 13.
That's not being heard today.
Um, the sponsor is ill.
Uh, apparently there's also an
issue with one of the
amendments.
So for the committee be looking
for that, I think the amendment.
Uh, might change.
Um, secondly, I want to talk
about
Uh, agendas in general.
Uh, I put bills on the agenda
in.
intending to get to them.
Um, so I try to create an agenda
that is
Um, you know, fair and
manageable.
Uh, I know this over in the
Senate, in particular.
There are bills that say on
agendas for days and days.
Um, and I think that's unfair to
uh the bill's sponsors, and I
think it's unfair to the public.
Um, because they have to show up
in case the bill gets heard.
And then it just gets rolled off
the end of the agenda.
So I try not to do that.
Um
Because I try not to do that.
Unfortunately, if Bill does get
rolled,
I don't have another bill on the
agenda that I can put in its
place.
So this happened last week, um.
Uh, last Thursday, we weren't
ready, um.
To hear House Bill 35 because
the committee said hadn't been
sent out, uh, that wasn't the
fault of the sponsors.
Um, so we had to roll that and
so we sort of had leftover time,
um, I, I'm trying to do in our
uh
Tuesday, Thursday meetings, I'm
trying to do 3 bills.
Um
They were down the tube.
Um, so I just just wanted to
explain that was the philosophy
that when I put something on the
agenda, it's my intention to
hear it.
Um, that doesn't always happen.
Um, so as a result, uh, partly
as a result of that, um, we will
be meeting this weekend.
Uh, we'll be meeting Saturday.
Uh, we're gonna start at 10.
And we're gonna be in room 315.
Because this room was already
taken.
So that's uh 3:15 it's just
Uh, the far side of the 317.
The numbers are in order for
reasons I don't understand, um.
And it's not uh it's more of a
like on the conference table
kind of committee rooms, so it's
a little more cramped.
Um
But that's, that's the best we
could do and it seemed like
people want to meet on Saturday,
rather than Sunday.
Um, speaking of meeting on
Saturday rather than Sunday.
I think a lot of committees are
meeting on Saturday.
So I, I'm pretty sure
preparations is meeting at the
same time, we're meeting a
judiciary is meeting at the same
time, we're meeting.
Um, and we're gonna have to just
sort of.
Uh, have people coming in and
out of the meetings.
Uh, as needed, so.
Um, representative Beta and I
are both on judiciary.
Um
You know, I will spend most of
my time in house energy, but
I may need to leave on occasion.
Uh, any questions about either
of those items?
OK. Any, anything, uh, else from
the committee?
OK, and I forgot to take the
role, didn't I?
You can remind me about that.
OK, Rosan Montoya, yes, um.
Mr. Chair, I just wanted to make
sure that we were gonna be able
to go back to the
Uh, public for comment on things
that on 35 that are.
Uh
That are part of the of the
Amended portion
Uh, and the substitute.
We had that discussion.
When
So Representative Montoya, we
did have that discussion.
And
I have a list of changes.
And they seem technical to me.
Not some sense. So we're moving
language around.
We're clarifying that the term
gas includes natural gas.
Um, the penalties have changed.
presumably the sponsor can
address that.
Um
And we're inserting definitions
in different areas of law.
Chair, I did have some folks who
were hoping to send uh speak a
little bit on those.
If uh
I think if you're in a field to
do that, I just want to make
sure that folks that, OK, and
are they here to speak on those
issues?
Yeah, there's at least one that
I, yeah, there's 2 of them here.
OK.
I didn't mean to interrupt, but
we will limit it to those
issues, yeah.
So if you have general
opposition or support of the
bill.
I will cut you off.
So I didn't mean to interrupt.
Let's do, uh, let's do roll
call.
Representative Ubeda.
Here.
Yeah
Representative Dixon.
Representative Garcia.
Representative Grola, here,
Representative Henry.
Yeah
Represented Montoya.
Here.
Representative Murphy here.
Representative Senator Cortez
here.
Represent a small
Vice Chairana.
Jerry McQueen
Here
We have corn.
OK, um,
So our first bill today is House
Bill 35, Children's Health
Protection zones, uh, as you may
recall, we started this bill
last Thursday. We did public
comment on the bill.
Uh, we do have a committee sub.
Um
Did someone move the committee
set for discussion.
Mr. Chair, I move, um, the
community suffer for discussion.
OK. Um, so why don't we have
Um
Resentarana, did you, you did
not present the bill last week,
did you? OK.
OK, why don't you uh go ahead
and present the bill.
If you could highlight uh the
differences between uh the bills
introduced and the committee
said that would be useful.
And then after you present the
bill, uh, we will go to the
public, uh, for comments on just
the differences between the two.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I'm Debbie Serignon. I
represent House District 21. I
have my expert witness, Gail
Evans, a climate director, the
Center of biological diversity
and Larin Johnson, also from the
Center of Biological Diversity.
All right, Mr. Chairman. Um,
I'm going to take it section by
section.
Uh, we have, we are making
changes to the oil and gas Act
and to the Air Quality Control
Act.
So the Oil and Gas Act, Section
1, page 1, it adds definitions
for the children's health
protection zone.
Operator, um.
Production facility and school.
Section 2, page 5, gives the oil
conservation division, the
authority to adopt rules to
effectuate children's health
protection zone.
Section 3, page 10. It increases
the penalty cap and daily
maximum in the children's Health
protection zone for violations
of 30,000 per day per violation,
and 3 million total.
The Oil conservation division
retains authority to account for
circumstances in imposing
penalties.
The current limit for everyone
outside of the children's
protection protection zone is
22,500 per day or 10,000 per day
if the risk is to health safety
or environment with a $200,000
penalty cap.
Um
Section 4, page 14. This is the
news section.
Prohibits permitting of new oil
and gas development in the
Children's Health Protection
zone, except where it would
cause a taking, protects the
state from takings claims
through variances administered
by the oil and Conservation
division.
Section 5. This is a new section
requires all oil and gas
operators to submit an inventory
of wells and a statement
regarding whether any facility
in the Children's Health
protection zone.
Whether any facility is in the
Children's Health protection
zone, sorry.
Only for facilities in the
Children's Health protection
zone operators must also submit
a list of.
Maps of schools within 1 mile.
Section 6, page 18.
This is a new section.
This adds additional
requirements for facilities in
the Children's Health protection
zone.
They must show contact
information, dust reduction
measures like speed limits and
coverage of dusty materials.
And testing of produced water
that that leaves the property.
Section 7. This is also a new
section. Operators within the
Children's Health Protection
zone must suspend operation if a
leak is detected and continues
for more than 48 hours.
Operation can resume when the
leak is corrected or if operator
demonstrates that the detected
leak is actually from a
different facility.
Chemical constituents and
potentially the threshold for a
leak will be defined in the
facility's leak detection and
response plan.
The New Mexico Environment
Department will adopt rules for
these plans and ensure that they
are implemented.
Operators are required by
statute to report any leak to
both the Environment departments
and the oil conservation
division.
Among others, the oil
conservation division approves
the resumption of operation.
The Oil conservation division
handles this because it is an
operational, because it is
operational, operators report
whether or not there is a leak
based on their own detection
system and implemented plan.
Oil Conservation division is not
responsible for any air quality
testing.
Because it remains with oil
conservation division, failure
to suspend can trigger the
increased penalties from Section
3.
Section 8, page 20. This is a
new section.
Operators within the Children's
Health protection zone must at
request of nearby property
owners, test ground and surface
water.
Before and shortly after
drilling.
Operators must provide notice to
owners and tenants within 1 mile
of the silty, at least 30 days
before drilling, respond within
10 days and availability for
testing within 15.
They must follow up testing 30
to 60 days after drilling and
results will be reported to the
owner tenants and division.
Cos of testing are on the
operator.
Subsection D defines water
testing requirements. These are
basic requirements, um, they're
not burdensome and produced
water testing can be much more
onerous on this because we are
looking at hundreds of specific
chemicals, specifically PA.
Section, subsection F and G
provide two exemptions to
prevent damage to life, health,
or natural resources, or a state
or federal agency has determined
that water is not a source of
the drinking water. All right,
that is all for the Gas and Oil
Act. Now we're going to the Air
Quality Act.
It again starts with
definitions, Section 9, page 23.
Definition, it adds definitions
for the children's Health
protection zone.
Oil and gas operator and school.
Section 10, page 29 requires
environmental improvement board
to adopt rules that would one in
one sea said implementation of a
performance standards for leak
detection and response plan.
When D to find additional
requirement components of those
plans, and one other rules
needed to effectuate the
children's health protection
zone.
Section 11, page 34. This is the
new section. It requires
operators in the Children's
Health Protection zone to submit
leak detection and response plan
to the Environment Department.
These plans are defined in part,
in part in House Bill 35, but
many details are left to the
environment Improvement Board to
set through rulemaking, ensuring
Um, a list of toxic chemicals of
concern, so the plan has to have
a list of toxic chemicals of
concern identified with the
environment Improvement Board or
local officials to have
continuous emissions monitoring
to detect leaks.
Standards to be set by the
Environment Improvement Board.
An alarm response protocol
developed in consultation with
local officials that provide an
immediate action to address
leaks and notification in the
oil conservation division in New
Mexico, New Mexico environment
division, local responders and
community members. These
protocols must comply with the
state, local, and federal
requirements.
The New Mexico Environment
Department must review leak
detection and response plans and
request updates at least every 5
years.
Every 2 years it must hold a
public workshop for operators to
provide guidance on leak
detection and response plans,
and it must post leak detection
and response pans plans on the
agency websites.
Section 12, page 36.
This is also a new section. It
requires reporting of leaks.
Operators report to the
Environment Department and the
Environment reports to the
legislature.
Reports include time detection
systems are not operating.
Alarms, leaks, community
notification, suspension of
operation and the results of
quality, water quality testing.
Section 13, new section.
Operators in the Children's
Health Protection zone was
suspend operation if a facility
is not implemented an approved
leak detection and response plan
or facilities out of compliance
with the air quality Control Act
or local ordinances adopted
pursuant to the air quality
Control Act.
We have to remember facilities
out of compliance in the
children's health protection
zone are breaking the law.
And exposing our children to
extreme amounts of toxic
pollution.
This is Pur Secretary Kennedy,
and in the water committee in
November, he said 70% of the oil
and gas industry is not in
compliance with air emissions
standards, 70%, and when we have
73,000 wells per LFC's numbers.
70% is almost 51,000 wells
polluting beyond the legal
limits and breaking the law.
HB 35 does not require them to
suspend their operation
indefinitely. It just requires
them to come into compliance
with pre-existing laws that New
Mexico environment department
should already be enforcing.
These sort of bad axers are the
major reason that air quality in
Eddy and Lee County is well
above the federal ozone limits.
Now, to explain the
subcommittee.
Um, in short, the changes made
in the subcommittee, um, I mean
committee sub sorry, ensure that
the environment department and
the, and New Mexico and the
environmental improvement board.
will use their expertise to one
determine what is necessary in a
leak detection and response plan
that protects children and air
quality.
To, it ensures that each
facility has implemented these
necessary components in a in a
way that reflects the details of
that facility's operation and
location.
Primarily this will make the
children's health protection
zone more effective.
It should also reduce the
overall cost of implemented
implementation by relying on
existing expertise and workflow
of the Environment Department
and O Conservation division
rather than wholly new
responsibilities on the oil
conservation division.
Increase in maximum penalties
reflects feedback from the
cabinet secretary and department
and deputy secretary of both
Ener and the Environment
Department.
They believe this would improve
their ability to enforce the law
against bad actors.
That's it, Mr. Chairman. I'd
like to defer to my expert
witness.
You, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, just to summarize the
difference between the original
bill and the committee sub.
Is my mic working?
Is that um originally the
responsibilities were, um,
almost entirely with the oil
conservation division in terms
of monitoring the oil and gas
wells that are within the
children's health protection
zones. And based on feedback
from the oil conservation
division. We moved those
responsibilities.
Primarily over to the
environment department. And
that's because the Environment
department, uh, is already
responsible for monitoring air
quality and the primary role of
the monitoring that will occur
for the wells that are within
the health protection zone or to
be monitoring the air quality.
So the bill, um, the new bill
takes some of those
responsibilities and puts them
with the environment department
instead of leaving them with the
oil conservation division.
And that was really, it's, it we
just pieces were moved from one
agency to the other agency.
Thank you.
OK, um, I should have done this
before, but um.
Representative starting you on,
like, can you read the 229
number on the committee.
Mr. Chairman, 229872.3.
Yeah.
Everyone got that.
OK, and that uh is available
online.
Um
If you're interested.
Um
So, uh, we're gonna do a limited
public comment, um.
Let's maybe do um 3 in
opposition, 3 in support, but
only
On those changes.
Um
In the mic for the audience.
Let's see opposition first.
So you have 2 minutes?
Uh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, um, my name is Jim
Winchester. I'm the executive
director of the Independent
Petroleum Association of New
Mexico.
Um, couple of comments on the
amendments. Uh, first of all,
as, as arbitrary as this one
mile setback in the proposed
bill is,
The amendment offers equally
arbitrary parameters. So on page
10, the sub now calls for fines
up to 3 million with even
specifying specifically what
constitutes a violation. And in
the eyes of our small producers,
3 million is excessive, and even
the original $200,000 level,
which is in state statute is
more than enough to end any
further economic recovery for
small or mid-sized well, and it
will shut down. And maybe that
is the goal.
here in the bill at large to
shut industry down. Now, the
amendment sub on pages 1623, and
34 new language calls for state
rulemaking that provides
adequate notice to interested
stakeholders in a transparent
process in which the public can
participate.
I'm here today to tell you that
those processes have already
happened at the appropriate
levels with nearly 2 dozen New
Mexico local counties that are
actually in those oil and gas
production zones. The local
communities.
have not asked for a one size
fits all rule.
They've had their local
stakeholders weigh in with their
own transparent process in their
own communities when they made
their own rules.
And each community has a setback
that works for them.
And finally, my question on a
state stakeholder process in a
state rulemaking. Recent history
on new regulatory state rules in
our industry have allowed
stakeholders.
To be out of state.
Environmental lawyers.
Lobbyists and activists with
their own agendas for New
Mexico's oil and gas industry.
Let alone telling the local
communities what works for them.
So IPAM does stand in opposition
to the sub. Thank you.
Anyone else in the audience in
opposition?
On the changes.
Is there anyone online in
opposition to the changes?
Well.
You
Good morning, Mr. Chairman,
members of the committee, my
name is TJ Trio. I'm a
registered lobbyist for
Occidental Petroleum, um.
I don't want to repeat the test
some of the testament was given
previously and now I will just
say that we continue to remain
concerned on these amendments.
We actually think the amendments
continue to go uh too far at
this juncture and uh and again
we would request that the
committee oppose the bill. Thank
you.
Thank you. Anyone online, raise
your hand if you want like to
speak in opposition, go all the
way.
OK, is there anyone who would
like to speak in support of the
changes in the committee sub.
OK, so we're gonna do
Hold on a second, is there
anyone on, uh, OK, we are, we
tune the audience and one
online.
Um,
You'll have 2 minutes, uh, and
please let me your your comments
to the changes, not the bill
overall. Yes. Thank you, Mr.
Chair, members of the committee.
My name is Sharon Argenbright.
I'm a nurse for almost 50 years,
took care of pediatric patients,
ICU patients, and um
Pollution is as pollution does.
Have we asked the children.
Thank you. I need you to limit
your comments and changes, not
the bill as a whole. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Chair.
Committee, my name's Athena
Christodoulou. I'm a retired
Navy commander and an energy and
environmental engineer. What I
like about the changes in this
bill is it does put the duties
of air quality back into NMED.
That has been an issue that we
have needed to address. And so
I'm hoping this will also
include using methane sat so
that we can expose the
industry's lies of
underreporting its methane, it
is an issue.
Thank you.
One more,
one more, last one.
Mr. Chair members of the
committee on Charles Goodmacher
speaking on behalf of Earthworks
this morning, uh, I'd like to
address an issue that was
brought up by a previous speaker
who was in opposition section 3,
page 10, increasing the penalty
cap to $330,000 a day. The
current limits, as you stated
correctly, are 2500 a day or
10,000 a day of risk to health,
safety or environment or
$200,000 max. Clearly, this is
not sufficient to motivate.
the industry where 60% of the
oil and gas wells investigated
by the state over 6 months of
investigations were found not to
be in compliance, so clearly
this is needed. Thank you.
OK, we're gonna do one online,
uh, Kaylee Shu.
Hello, my name is Kaylee Shu,
and I'm a community organizer
with Citizens Caring for the
Future in Southeast New Mexico.
I want to emphasize, I'm a
community member in Southeast
New Mexico. I actually live
here.
That is in support of HB 35. I
also wanted to speak to the
increase in penalties and why
that is essential, despite
having the statewide ozone
precursor rule, and I believe
this was already mentioned. We
have seen rising ozone levels
here in southeast New Mexico,
um, particularly at Eddy County,
and we're actually one of the
only regions in the country
where ozone levels are rising
instead of declining. And I
think this really speaks to the
fact that
Um, first of all, self-reporting
is not always sufficient, and we
really do need these um
regulatory agencies properly,
um, with proper budget so that
they are able to enforce these
rules, but it also goes to show
that these penalties must be
large enough that there is an
impact for these oil and gas
companies, and it's just not
absorbed into their cost of
business.
As they usually is. Lastly, in
the Permian Basin, I hear, um,
Winchester's concerns and the
Permian Basin where a lot of the
oil production is happening in
the country. These are large
producers that can afford to
operate here in the Berm and
they can also afford these
penalties. Thank you for your
time.
OK. Thank you very much. um
Representative Sarana, is there
anything you'd like to add
before we go to the committee?
Um, I would, I just would like
to, um, some of the things that
came up, we are not trying to
shut down the oil and gas
industry.
We are trying to hold them
accountable because they are,
uh, they're breaking the laws,
51,000 wells are breaking the
law. They just need to follow
the law. Second, um, Secretary
Kinney, I asked him and Deputy
Secretary Shelton to be here,
but they had asked the governor,
I don't see them.
I'm going to read you what he
said.
So when we asked Mner and ED
about this bill. This is his
response. As far as penalty caps
should be increased. He wanted
exceed $3 million.
He said, while I understand
penalty caps. They often result
in lower penalties for larger
companies where their net worth
is magnitude higher than the
cap, so the penalty is
meaningless to their bottom
line.
I would say the penalty should
be 3 million or 1% of their net
worth, which is whichever is
larger.
Um
Uh, consult EPA or NMED civil
penalty policy for the size of
violators, calculation for
language, if, if you want this
in-law, so.
These numbers came from our
secretary of the Environment of
departments who believes this is
important.
I like to pest uh actually thank
you Mr. Chairman, we stand for
questions.
OK, members of the committee.
Murphy.
Good morning. Good morning.
Uh, Mr. Chairman, uh,
representative.
Um
Believe I've got
Your name Gail Evans, is that
correct? Did I write that down
correctly?
And Josh, I didn't get your John
Johnson.
Thank you, Mr. Johnson.
Um, Mr. Chairman, um, I'll
direct my questions to the table
and, and you all can decide who
best to answer.
Um, I know that the chairman
wants to, uh, he has a
reputation for wanting to move
things along. So, uh, I want to
tell you that I've broken my
questions out into a few parts,
and I think it'll give you a
chance to to think about your
answers beforehand, uh, the
first is the approach and the
science behind it.
Second, we'll move into the
bill. I'd like to talk about 1B,
1D 1G.
Few general questions along that
process.
Um
Third, Mr. Chairman, um, and,
uh, witnesses the, uh, experts,
the, uh, fiscal impacts.
Um, and then intersect, which is
uh somewhat, and then 2 C and G.
Uh, section 4.
Um, and then I've got one large
question over sections 56, and
7. I'm making an assumption. I
hope you guys can confirm.
Mr. Chairman, uh, members and
then 5 is is some duplication.
So, um,
My understanding of of the bill
and, and please correct me if
I'm wrong.
is to lower the ozone layer
ozone levels and improve the air
quality in their schools and
other areas.
Because schools is broadly
defined uh where children
congregate. Is that a correct
assumption?
Mr. Chair and Representative,
yes.
It is to protect children and
improve the air quality around
schools so that children aren't
being breathing such bad air
when they're in school. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman, um.
Representative, um,
Why single out ozone. It is my
understanding that it is one of
5 of the major components to air
quality.
With particulate matter, carbon
monoxide and carbon dioxide
being worse. Why the focus on
ozone?
Um, Mr. Chair, Representative,
we're not just focused on ozone.
We're focused on all of the
pollutants that come inherently
with oil and gas production, and
that's why we're trying to
ensure that there's no new oil
and gas production within 1 mile
of schools.
Thank you. Um, isn't AQI or air
quality index recognized by EPA
and other agencies is the gold
standard in measuring air
quality. Why not use this?
Mr. Chairman
Sorry about that.
Mr. Chair and Representative
Murphy, um, in fact, the um
standard set by the EPA, the
National Ambient Air Quality
Standards, otherwise known as
the NA.
Um, this corner of the state,
uh, their air quality readings
in that corner of the state are
actually above those basic
federal health quality standards
and actually make that corner of
the state.
Eligible to be a designated as a
non-attainment zone because the
air quality does not comply with
federal health standards, and
that failure to comply with
federal health standards is due
to the massive amounts of oil
and gas production that occur in
that corner of the state.
Thank you Mr. Chairman, um.
Actually, the, isn't it true
that the air the ozone layer
levels.
In particular, are poor across
the entire state.
Not just Southeastern Mexico and
Eddie County.
Uh, Mr. Chair and
Representative, no, um, what is
true is that in the two corners
of the state with heavy oil and
gas production, they have a poor
air quality than many other
parts of the state, it is true
that there are other parts of
the state that also have poor
air quality, um, due to, um,
other things such as uh.
I, I believe emissions, other
forms of emissions. Um, but the,
the issue with Eddie and Lee
County and with uh San Juan
County is a bees are uh
considered rural counties and
it's unusual for counties that
are considered rural counties to
have such bad air quality and it
that bad air quality is due to
oil and gas production.
Um, Mr. Chairman, um,
I've looked at some of the air
quality maps across the state
and perhaps you can explain to
me, um,
Why the air quality, say, in
Roswell and Hobbs and Carlsbad
is many times from my review.
Uh, much better, um, and the air
quality in other parts of the
state.
Primarily it appears, and
correct me if I'm wrong, that
other factors are impacting the
air quality in these other parts
of the state be a vehicle
admissions, particulate matter,
and that sort of thing so the
overall air quality in from my
review.
Um, appears to be better in some
of these rural areas, especially
in the suburban areas and they
are in some of our larger cities
is that incorrect?
Uh, Mr. Chair and
Representative, that's not my
understanding of uh the federal
air quality data.
Mr. Chairman, thank you. Um,
given, um,
Let's go into the studies. And
so, um, Mr. Chairman, um, did
you, uh, talk to us a little bit
about the science.
Uh, Mr. Chair and Representative
Murphy, we provided to the
interim committee, um, the water
and Natural Resources Committee,
as well as to the legislative
Finance Committee, um, a summary
of the science concerning the
health impacts of oil and gas
pollution, especially on
children, um, that summary shows
there are over 72.
Reviewed studies showing that
proximity to oil and gas
pollution, um, leads to
respiratory illnesses, um, and
can lead to cancer, um, and that
this, this is especially true,
um, for children and other
vulnerable populations and the
studies show that the further
away from oil and gas pollution,
you are, um, the less likely you
are to be impacted.
And I think that that science
has been borne out by looking at
the analyses from both the LFC
and the LESC. I don't think in
either of those FIRs there was
any dispute that being in close
proximity to oil and gas
production is dangerous for
children's health.
Mr. Chairman, thank you. Um,
Let's see, you mentioned the,
well, let's let's go back to the
studies. Um, if you could, I'd
appreciate a copy of that
summary.
Not a member of those committees
don't have that.
Um, Mr. Chairman, my, my
research and I, I, I found 3
studies, um, one by Stanford,
um, and that may be summarized
in my reading of that is that.
Primarily dealt with particulate
matter at 2.5, I believe, or
above.
Um
Is that one of the studies,
perhaps that is in your summary?
Mr. Chair
Mr. Chair representative Murphy,
I'm not aware of what study when
you say it's from Stanford. I'm
not, you'd have to give me the
author of the study.
OK, great. Thank you. Uh, there
were two others, Berkeley and
Johns Hopkins and all were not
related to methane or ozone.
Uh, Mr. Chair.
Um, can you describe to me the
consultation process that you
went through, the sacral
stakeholder consultation
process. Actually, there's 4
questions here but I'll just
combine it. I'm mainly
interested in the number of
meetings with NGOs, with the
number of Mr. Chair, the number
of meetings, OCD environment
department LFC Economic
Development. The number of
meetings with affected
communities, their town and city
councils and commissioners and
with industry from the Northwest
and southeast you, Mr. Chair,
could you, you describe that?
They call this consultation
process.
Mr. Chair and Representative
Murphy, um, this issue of
putting in place health
protection zones from oil and
gas production has been under
discussion in the state for
several years now, um, as the
science has become more and more
clear that proximity to oil and
gas production is dangerous. And
in fact, last year, um, the oil
conservation division held
extensive stakeholder meetings
with industry and with various
Um, community groups and
environmental organizations, um,
and I believe they did propose a
bill last year or perhaps the
year before HB 133, um, that
included a health protection
zones, um, so there, there has
been numerous convenings by the
state to discuss this issue and
um and a proposal was made that
proposal didn't move forward.
In the legislature and uh
representative Sarayana has
honed in on a, a much narrower
proposal of simply putting 1
mile around schools. And I think
what's so important about this
proposal is that there's only
right now about 800 oil and gas
wells within 1 mile of schools.
So that's 800 out of 70+,000
wells.
So it's about, it's less than 1%
of all of the wells. Um, so this
is a very modest proposal that
would simply
Children while they're at
school. Um, and it's not the
kind of proposal we've seen
other years which would be nice
to see, but we're not seeing
that now of putting in health
protection zones around
hospitals and around where
people live. We're not trying to
do that. We're just trying to
protect children while they're
at school.
Mr. Chair, thank you for, for
that. Um,
In particular, I'm concerned
about the consultations with
local officials, and I'd just
like to follow up, Mr. Chair, on
this question a little bit which
town councils county
commissioners.
Communities, um, and.
Elected officials in these areas
that this could impact if you
consult with.
Uh, Mister Chair Representative,
I personally haven't consulted
with them. I know that uh in the
summer, the legislative finance
Committee held a hearing in
Carlsbad, where many local
officials were there, and this
issue of uh setbacks and health
buffer zones, um, was presented
at that committee.
Uh, Mr. um, and were you, uh,
were you at that meeting?
Mr. Chair, representative, I
was. OK. Thank you. Um, how many
counties, Mr. Chair, um, how
many counties and municipalities
have existing setbacks?
Uh, Mr. Chair, Representative, I
don't know the exact number. I
know that some of the we have
the list here if you want to go
through it. I know that some of
the counties, um, and some of
the cities, uh, in the two major
oil and gas producing regions of
the state have.
Place, um, very minor setbacks
ranging, I believe, from 300 ft
to 500 ft and some have no
setbacks at all, which really
just indicates why it's so
important for the state
legislature to act to put in
place a meaningful setback to
protect children while they're
under the state's care at
school.
Mr. Chairman, um,
So would it surprise you if I
told you that 13, I think by my
count, counties all in uh major
oil and gas areas have setbacks.
Would would that number surprise
you? would it surprise you if
Mr. Chair, um, if, if 7 cities
and towns all in oil and gas
areas have setbacks, and that
regulatory agencies such as M
Mexo Energy Department has a
1000 ft setbacks for certain
facilities. So what
Would those numbers surprise you
at all that there's already a
lot of setbacks, uh, rules out
there. Representative Murphy and
Mr. Chair, excuse me, it doesn't
surprise me at all to know that
that number have uh
insignificant setbacks which
really don't protect the health
because they're only 300 ft or
perhaps in a few places, 500.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um,
Next question now moving into HB
35 itself.
Focusing on one B, not gonna
spend a lot of time on
definitions, but, um, on one
day, you've made some Mr. Chair,
um, and you've made some changes
to the definition of pool.
And the pool and pooling and to
mingling and all of those are
well understood, well litigated
terms and I just wonder if you
anticipate that by redefining
these, uh, that could lead the
state into potential litigation,
and if not, why not?
Mr. Chair and Representative
Murphy, that's not a change to
the definition of the word pool.
That's simply, um, worked by the
drafters, the legislative
council service to make that
definition sort of comply with
modern statutory drafting, so
they've pulled up the term from
the bottom, common source of
supply.
Uh, you can see at the bottom,
the language is crossed out,
says Poole is synonymous with
common source of supply. And so
that has been pulled up to the
top to say pull or common source
of supply means, so it's not a
change in the definition.
Thank you. Um,
Mr. Chair
All I'm suggesting, OK, all I'm
suggesting is is that is that
this definition has been well
litigated and so, um, but thank
you for that clarification.
You're basically saying it means
the same thing. It does mean the
same thing, Mr. Chair,
Representative.
Um
1D, um, Mr. Chair, the
definition of children's health
protection zone, being an area
of 5280 ft.
Um
1G broadly defined school.
And
I guess
Uh, Mr. Chair, so within 1 mile
of the school, why, why 5280 ft.
Um
Uh
Mr. Chan and representative,
that's a very modest number of
5280 ft is a mile, and, uh, the
studies show that um that is a,
a minimal number. In fact,
children can be harmed up to 10
miles away and, um, oil and gas
pollution isn't, uh, it doesn't
just stay in one place, it
moves. So this was uh considered
a very modest, uh, set.
Back around schools. We could
have proposed 5 miles or 10
miles and still being, uh, in
compliance with the science.
Mr. Chair, um, madam, you
described it as a very modest
proposal, but if you actually
put
Um, 1 mile.
Around the school zone you're
actually condemning quite a bit
of acreage, correct?
Mr. Chair, um, because it's,
it's.
1 mile this way, 1 mile this
way, so you're really condemning
almost 5 miles of acreage.
Plus I don't understand your
setback.
Chair
Mr. Chair Representative, what I
know is currently within that
mile around schools.
Um, with all the development in
our state, there's only 800
wells.
And what I know from looking at
the LFC's FIR is in terms of the
impact on future production and
future revenue. It's a minuscule
amount. It's less than 1%. I
think it's less than, um, I
think it's 0.15 of 1% was the
number. So, um, this distance of
a setback, uh, does not have
really an impact on production
at all.
But it does have an impact on
the air quality around our
schools.
Mr. Chairman, um,
The
Amount of acreage that would be
condemned and and I'm reading
the bill here is from the
property line.
So this, this is the school
property line, you're going 1
mile in each direction, right?
Well, in this direction.
A mile is basically 640 acres,
so each one of these
designations would condemn.
I don't know, something on the
order of 2500 to 3000 acres.
And um
According to my math and Mr.
Chair, if, if
What am I not understanding when
you say it's minuscule.
Uh
Do you want to answer that
question? Um, thank you, Mr.
Chairman and Representative, I,
I talked to LFC, our chief
economist is Ismael Torres, and
he can't be here today. He's
sick, but he is online if we
need to speak with him, um, he
said it's minuscule to the
general fund and it may be a
mile, but it's still, um, the
amount.
The Effect on our general fund
on a state is minuscule.
Thank you, Mr. Chair
Representative, um, I would
dispute that, but uh I
appreciate your opinion. The uh
It is suggested Mr. Cherry, it
was suggested in public
testimony last week that this
will not result in stranded or
orphaned acreage.
Nor of any loss as you
mentioned, um,
To the revenue, but I also know
that the FIR says that even if
this is in place it have a very
minuscule effect on greenhouse
gasses.
Did I misread that or did I not,
uh, in the FIR.
Um
Mr. Chair Representative, what
we know is that if we can keep.
Oil and gas production away from
schools. It will help with the
air quality around schools. That
is the goal of this bill. This
is not a bill trying to fight
climate change, um, or, you
know, improve the quality of our
air overall. Uh, this is a very
limited, uh, modest bill trying
to improve air quality for
children while they are in the
state's care.
At school.
Uh, Mr. Chair, I'm now we're
gonna move into
Section 3 of my questions
regarding the fiscal impact.
Pretty quickly we'll be moving
into 2C and G, um, and Mr.
Chair, um,
An expert um.
Representative
Have you reviewed the industry
analysis that estimates the
4-year impact at 33 billion.
roughly 7 billion a year and
depending upon oil and gas
prices that this could cost the
state somewhere between 100 and
$400 billion on oil.
Mr. Chair, have you, have you
all reviewed that study and and
uh.
What do you think about it?
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative, I
haven't reviewed the study, but
I heard what you just said and
what I have reviewed is the
LFC's fiscal analysis and our
own analysis showing that um, as
we said, there's only about 800
wells currently within
Children's Health protection
zones, those wells aren't going
to be shut down by this
proposal, uh, those wells are
allowed to continue to exist
with extra mon.
Turing to make sure they're not
doing illegal emissions and
they're only emitting the, the
standard pollution that comes
with oil and gas production, um,
but given the LFC's FIR that
this would impact revenue of
0.15 of 1%, um, that is the
analysis that aligns with our
own analysis of looking how
minuscule the current production
is within Children's Health
protection zones.
I'd also add that um the state
land officer, uh, Stephanie
Garcia Richard indicated that
whilst they have put in place at
the land office, a 1 mile health
protection zone around schools,
um, they have never turned down
a lease based on that.
Um, so it really has an
impacted.
at the state land office.
Mr. Chair, uh, thank you for,
for that, and I understand um
your comments regarding to the
existing wells.
But I think what the industry
analysis would indicate that
perhaps the others, they're not
projecting future wells and
stranded acreage and um that is,
I think the numbers that we need
to focus on future development.
I appreciate that it may not
impact the existing wells.
However, I'd also note, um, Mr.
Chair and madam, perhaps you'd
agree with me or not that the
state land office rules is, is
much.
Narrower than this, this, this
rule is pretty expansive. Would
you agree with that or not?
Mr. Chair represented I don't
agree with that, um, the LFC's
fiscal analysis was discussing
future uh not yet permitted
production.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, let's
see here. 2 C.
N G
It's my understanding of the
Mexico Environment Department
already has the authority
described in 2C and penalty
assessment under 2G.
Is this correct that they they
have that authority in your is
it you're basically increasing
limits or representative what
page are you on?
I will be on probably about 8.
I have it in my notes.
I apologize. I believe I pulled
that off probably the previous
draft, so I'll move on.
Um, move on to section 4.
Um
Um
The second part
Before
He
I was trying to get to the
imminent domain section in the
takings.
Yeah
And now
Let me just ask generally, I
believe there's a section in the
bill.
That talks about
Eminent domains and.
And uh the question of taking.
And I can't seem to locate that
provision, but
If the state, Mr. Chair, and,
and uh if the state has to pay
just compensation.
Um, to leases holders that can't
be, um, can't develop their
leases.
Um, who will, who will pay for
that?
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
the bill sets out a process for
operators to apply for what's
called a variance if uh the
their denial of a permit in a
children's health protection
zone would uh result in a loss
of all economic value of their
property or res result in severe
adverse economic impact. Um, and
this is the
Standard that's to be applied to
determine if there has been a
so-called taking. I would say a
term of constitutional law and
what the bill does is that it
puts in place a mandatory
administrative process so that
the oil conservation division is
the first to decide whether or
not um they should in fact grant
an exception and allow drilling
within the children.
' s Health protection zone. So
this is a way to protect the
state from takings litigation
because the OCD can review and
make the first assessment as to
whether or not to uh grant that
exception and allow the drilling
within the health protection
zone. And the way the bill is
written, that's a requirement
that the driller, the operator
would need to go through, um.
To have that internal
administrative um process um
before, uh, moving forward.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, uh, madam,
the, uh, I'm curious about the
standard being all.
Um, this would be 4C2A result in
a loss of all economic value of
the applicant's property. Why
all? Why not part?
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
it's not all. There's all that
there comes with an oar after
the A or result in a severe
adverse economic impact and
deprive the applicant of
objectively reasonable
investment-backed expectations.
That's the standard set forth in
uh the law about what
constitutes a taking.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, I guess,
um, who determines under this
should be the.
The objectively reasonable
investment back expectations,
Mr. Chair.
Who makes that determination.
How's that based?
Mr. Chair representative, that
would be determined uh by the
oil conservation division
through an administrative
process. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um, moving on to section 4 being
aligning agencies. This is sort
of the broad question, um,
section 5 is
Protection zone inventory 6.
Operations in the, in the, uh,
Detection zones, 7, suspension
of operations 8, water quality
sampling and testing.
And um
Mr. Cha, so my question is,
How much consultation and if you
could dig in a little deeper
than you did last time, did you
have with OCD environment
department, state engineer, BLM
tribal authorities, local
authorities, um.
Regarding the industry practices
contained in sections 5 through
8. How many of these might be
duplicative of things that are
already being required by OCD
and VOM.
Um
So if you could uh
If you could.
Um
Answer why uh.
Have you, have you undertaken
enough, uh, consultations to
make sure these are not
overlapping and.
this
Mr. Chair Representative, uh,
yes, we have ensured they are
not overlapping or duplicative,
uh, OCD and NMED has reviewed
this bill does not indicated
that those sections are
duplicative or overlapping.
These are in fact new uh
obligations for the OCD um to do
extra work for the 800 wells
that exist within uh health
protection.
zones to place this leak
detection and response plan and
um to uh ensure additional
monitoring around noise levels
and dust levels around
children's health protection
zones, and to do extra testing
of water if it's requested
around wells that are uh in
children's health protection
zones. So these are not, um.
These are not already required
in the law. These are new
requirements.
4 wells within the health
protection zones, Mr. Chairman,
um, thank you for that. I, in
reviewing those as an oil and
gas operator reviewing some of
those requirements. It appeared
to me that many of them were
already complying with and maybe
because we principally operate
on federal lands, but we also
have state lands as well and so
um at any rate I'll, um,
It sounds like you did have some
discussions on that, um, but
from my experience it they many
of them appeared duplicative.
um, now to my last few
questions.
Um
Regarding sections 9 and 10.
Um
Mr. Chairman, it appears that
section 9 is incorporating.
Sterling's Health protection
zones and other definitions into
the air quality control Act.
Is that correct?
Mr. Chair Representative, it is
correct.
Thank you.
And you know, uh, Mr. Chair, uh
you don't believe this will lead
to any regulatory overlap and
confusion between the
environment department and the
energy department. And if not,
why not?
Mr. Chair Representative, no, it
will not. In fact, that was the
purpose for the committee sub
was to pull out, um, the air
quality monitoring pieces, which
is what, uh, enemyD already does
and put those all in a revisions
to the air quality Control Act,
which is the law that the
Environment Department uh
implements.
Lastly, thank you Mr. Chair, uh,
thank you for that. Section 10,
I think you've answered this,
but just to clarify section 10
gives authority for standards on
equipment to the EIB, not OCD.
Is that correct? Can you, and
can, would you please, Mr.
Chair, explain the rationale
behind that. I think I
understand that.
Mister Chair Representative,
that equipment is emissions
detection equipment and
emissions, uh, is the work of,
uh, the environment department.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair,
that concludes my remarks.
Thank you, Representative
Representative Henry.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, uh,
Representative and her experts,
uh, I've just got a couple of
quick questions, um, whereas I
fully support the protection of
children's health and safety,
um, but the reality is, as we've
already heard, there's many
setbacks already been put in
place by local communities and
counties.
Um, I kind of want to, and it's
gonna sound like I'm asking the
same questions to some extent,
but what Representative Murphy
did with the
Who, uh
On the local governing boards,
did y'all reach out to minus the
one meeting that it was talked
about. Did y'all reach out to
any local governing board school
districts to ask if this was
something that they in fact were
looking.
Um
Chairman McQueen and
Representative Henry, we did in
fact send to all of the school
boards and the superintendents,
I believe to 8 different school
boards and their
superintendents, uh, letters
about this effort, um, and maps
showing all of the wells around
their schools and assign and the
science summary, uh, showing
that um how oiling
gas production near schools uh
is risky for children's health.
So we did reach out to all of
the school districts, um, and
we, beyond that, no, I have not
gone in front of local county
commissions. We are well aware
of the 300 and 500 ft setbacks
at some places have in place as
well as the fact that some
places have no setbacks in
place, um, and
This seems to be a good reason
to put in place this law.
Thank you, Representative Mr.
Chairman. Mr. Chairman
Representative, the next
question I have is why did we
not take that approach.
And the reason I ask this just
for your information, I am in a
local representative for 8
years. I was an 80 County
commissioner for 8 years. I'm
actually the mayor of Artesia
now for 2 years.
So living right in the middle of
oil and gas country.
Nobody, none of my constituents,
and I've never been approached
on how to increase these
setbacks or what these setbacks
mean. Why would we not take the
approach to try to go to the
local level to have these
discussions rather than think
the state needs to.
Override.
Um,
Mister Chair and Representative,
the goal of this bill is to
protect children while they're
at school, and the vast, vast,
vast majority of our children go
to state schools, and so they're
in the state's care, essentially
while they're at school, um, and
it's all of our responsibility
to ensure that when our children
are at school, they're not being
poisoned by unnecessary
pollution near their schools, so
this
is a a state level.
proposal that uh if implemented,
uh, certainly includes uh local
participation in the
implementation in terms of
implementing the leak detection
and emergency response plan, um,
that calls for uh local
involvement as well as um
notice, um, uh, you know, so in
terms of operating the wells
that are currently within the
zone that would require local
involvement to ensure.
That those wells are operating
legally, but yes, this is a
statewide policy to protect
children when they're in the
state's care.
Thank you, Representative Mr.
Chairman, and I understand what
you keep saying. I guess I'm
just gonna keep beating on the
point of I've actually have a
letter as we all have a letter
signed by well over 60
representatives, local school
districts, counties, and cities,
um, that, that did not ask for
this bill, do not support this
bill, um, and I hear your
argument that it's because this
is a state that while they're in
school, it's a state controlled
environment. I
my next question was, if, if
we're going to circumvent local
control and and.
Call it because they're in a
steaks care. Uh, my
understanding is last night
there was a judgment that was
actually rendered, um, about the
school days, right? The 180
school days and and the judgment
was, this is a local issue, the
local schools should be doing
that. So why would we think that
that ruling would be more
important because that is also a
state they're they're saying the
locals should control their,
their days and how they go to
school. That's local.
And yet the, the state is saying
that they should override it.
How is this different than, than
that ruling last night. So
represent Henry, uh, we're,
we're a little bit off the bill.
I would point out that the
ruling wasn't.
Um, the local control over road,
um, the public education
department, it was that the
public education department, uh,
acted in contravention of a
state statute.
That, that was the issue of my
understanding, Mr. Chairman, is,
is it puts it back to the local
school districts to decide
whether they're on a 4-day week,
5-day week, or those types of
deals. Is that correct, Mr.
Chairman?
Representative Henry, that's
correct because that's what the
statute says. And, and so I
guess, Mr. Chairman, how's that
germane to, to what we're saying
now is, is if we're making the
argument that this bill is
because they're in state care
and state statute obviously
already says that in states care
to local school district should
have uh
Decisions on how they go to
school. How would this not, how
would this be different in that
matter.
So Robert Henry, I did not
intend to sidetrack you as I
appear to have, um, I apologize
for that.
My point is the state statute
specifies the days.
Right, Mr. Chairman. I, I guess
my question and, and I'm not
sidetracked, I just want to stay
on. I, I still have a hard time
with
When you say that local, local.
municipalities, counties, school
districts have put
non-meaningful distances in. I
think the most you said is 500
words. In fact, there are some
at 1000.
Um, and then yet in your, in
your
Debate or discussion, uh, you
said that a mile really wasn't
enough. You needed 5 to 10 to
really make a difference.
So how is this more meaningful
than what the locals have
already put into place.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative.
Um, I didn't say you needed 5 or
10 to make a difference. I said
that the science supports a
setbacks of up to 5 or even 10
miles in terms of risks to
children's health, um, being in
proximity to oil and gas
production, but air quality um
is already regulated and
controlled by the state and the
the state regulates, um, oil.
and gas production through the
oil and gas Act and through the
Air Quality Control Act. And so
it's already in the state's
hands, and these are amendments
to those two state laws, um, to
require some additional
protection for children.
Thank you, Mr. Chair
Representative, I guess going
along what you just said. So
there are already regulations in
place to oversee air quality,
um, leaks, anything like that
that happens in oil and gas. Is
that correct?
Uh, representative, Mr. Chair
and Representative, uh, yes, the
air quality Control Act requires
air quality that complies with
federal health standards, even
though our air doesn't comply
with federal health standards,
but yes, that law is in effect,
and we do have an oil and gas
act. That Oil and Gas Act does
not um have protections um
around uh like health buffer
zones. It doesn't have any
setbacks in it, and this would
be an amendment.
this.
So, Mr. Chairman Representative,
why in this bill when, when we
have the leak detection and all
those things that are that are
referenced that I think are even
in in some of your uh
Got to get new to some of these
words. Your second bill. What's
the word I'm looking for?
Subsequent subsequent bill.
Um
Committee Bill, thank you. Uh.
When we're defining these, why
was that pulled out when there's
already regulations in place to
try to
Take care of that, those issues.
Um, Mr. Chair Representative,
because there aren't pieces in
the law right now to take care
of those things. This is new.
So it's new, Mr. Chair, sorry,
Mr. Chair representatives knew
that to have le protection or
leak uh
Any kind of leakage detection on
whales is that that'll be new.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
that would be new in the
statute. There's nothing in a
statute that requires a leak
detection and a response plan
and that section of the statute
just applies to wells that are
in the children's health
protection zones. OK.
Thank you, Representative, Mr.
Chairman.
Um
The other question I would have
that that I've heard some
testimony on it and, and along
with, with what Representative
Murphy was talking about, uh,
Mr. Chair Representatives, when
we hear about the, the illness,
um, the increase in illness in
these areas around oil and gas.
I guess just looking into it,
um, asthma has come up quite
often, and I noticed that in San
Juan and Eddy County, actually
our asthma rates are lower than
the average. Is that correct,
Mr. Chair Representative?
Uh, Mister Chair Representative,
no, I don't believe that is
correct.
So am I wrong, Mr. Chair and
Representative, when I believe
the average for the states
around 40% and then Eddie and
San Juan County, I believe
that's around 35%, if I'm
correct, you can double check me
on that, but the information I
looked at looked like that was.
Kind of what they're going off.
Representative, it's my
understanding from a Department
of Health data that there is
increased, um, rates of
respiratory illness in Eddie and
Lee County.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman
Representative, but again, I
address what I'm asking is
Do y'all see that asthma in
those two counties, Eddie and
San Juan are actually lower than
the state average. Would that
not contradict what, what you're
saying.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
that's not my understanding. In
fact, um, and Larin's just
handed me uh some information
saying that the San Juan asthma
rate is 48% and the Lee County
asthma rate is.
I think 24%.
Lee Kenny rates 24%.
and, and the average on the
state is 40%. Is that correct?
Excuse me, Mr. Chair
Representative. It's 24% above
the average. OK, the information
that we have on file is exactly
what I said. So I'll, I'll, I'd
be interested to see where y'all
got your information and how we
can compare those two,
we have that information from
the State Department of Health.
Very good. Thank you, Mr. Chair
Representative.
And
Um, just expand on that
Department of Health sent me an
email yesterday with specifics.
It said Chavis County, 58.4% per
1000, 62% above the overall
state rate, San Juan is 53.6 per
10,048% above the overall state
rate. Roosevelt is 51.2%, 42
above the overall estate rates.
Lee is 44.6, um 24 above the
overall state rates and Rio
Riba's 43.
19 above the overall state rate.
OK, cause I'm reading off of
this, uh.
Page 3, it's not in the bill.
It's something else we got here
because, however, Eddie and San
Juan counties have lower than
average rates of youth asthma
and hospitalization. So,
Not to belabor the point, that
is what I'm reading off of, off
of the information that was
given to us. I found that
interesting.
Um
You know, represent or Mr.
Chairman, representative, the
one thing I'll go back to and
then I'll kind of conclude here.
You know, when we heard House
Bill 109 last week, one of the
biggest points of that bill was
how important it was for locals
to have control, um, because
they know what's best, they,
they actually work with their
constituents on a daily basis. I
would make the same argument
with this bill that the local
control is a crucial piece, um,
because
Again, as I said earlier, I have
been a locally elected official
for over 8 years now. This, this
has never come up as an issue
with our constituents, with our
schools, um, and in our
communities, uh, and not only
that,
Our children go to the same
schools, and this is yet to be a
concern for any of us. And so,
With that, I, I hope that we
take the same approach we have
with other bills that this
committee has heard and realized
that local control, uh, is a
very
Important piece to how we
conduct our business. Thank you,
Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative,
representative, Senator Cortez.
Thank you Mr. Chair
Representative. Well, it is
always a beautiful day to debate
bills, thank you again for being
here today, whether you stand in
opposition or support of this
bill. Um, I do have some
questions regarding local
control, fiscal impact and
science, and Mr. Chair
Representative, I know you don't
like redundant questions, but I
assure you these are not
redundant, so indulge me a
little bit as I ask these
questions, it will be a
different spin on.
Representative Murphy and also
Representative Henry, Mr. Chair
Representative.
So my first question.
I, I'll, I'll preface it with
these comments first for local
control. Um, we have a city
ordinance inley County, so I
just want to preface all of
this. I live in Lee County, the
top number one oil producing
county in the nation along with
Eddie uh county representative,
uh, Mr. Chairs representative,
and I don't just come to you
today with these questions as a
representative, but I come to
you as a mama, being that you
guys are so concerned about our.
Our children. So, local control.
Just to
Clarify, Mister Chair
Representative.
As you have
Propose this new piece of
legislation.
Nobody from Lee County was
consulted.
5 hours away from where you
live, where the majority of this
legislation would be imposed.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
uh, Lee County does not have a
setback in place and uh no, we
did not discuss this bill. I am
so glad that you brought that
up, um, Mr. Chair
Representative, because actually
we do according to city
ordinance, drilling has to be
300 ft from the building,
equipment and our tanks with
product have to be within 750 ft
from the building. Um, we
require 1500 ft from a city's
water well to a.
Building and a building can be a
school residential, commercial,
etc. So we do have that city
ordinance in place, so was that
taken into account whenever you
guys drafted this bill, um, Mr.
Chair Representative, Mr. Chair
Representative, yeah, you just
read from the Hobbs City does
have that setback in place, but
what I stated is that Lee County
does not have any setback in
place. So Mr. Chair
Representative.
This bill that would be imposed,
would it also impact hops, where
I live.
Mr. Chair Representative, it
would impact the entire state.
OK, so thank you so much. I'm,
I'm so glad to be able to share
the setbacks that we already
have in place, um, Mr. Chair
Representative, um, I also keep
hearing that this will have a
meniscal financial impact. Well,
the FIR for HB 35 estimates that
revenue losses to the state
would also be to the 17 programs
funded by oil and gas revenues,
and that would range from 2
million
In fiscal year 26 to 13.5
million in fiscal year 29, and
ultimately would result in
increased operating budget
impacts. And so do you guys have
a plan in place to make up that
funding.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
that the, the total amount of
money is the minuscule impact
that we're talking about, um,
compared to the billions of
dollars that oil and gas does
bring into the state's revenue,
uh, a few million over multiple
years is minuscule.
And Mr. Chair Representative,
what about the 17 programs that
it would also impact is that
meniscal?
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
it's the monetary amount to each
program that counts and that is
minuscule. OK, I also have
another question, Mr. Chair
Representative, how many jobs do
you know would be impacted in in
my county in Hobbs where I live,
where oil and gas is number one
in the nation competing with
Eddie. Do you know how many jobs
would be impacted. I'm
considering that the overall
fiscal impact is 0.15 of
1% of future permitting, um, I
would presume from that that the
overall impact on jobs would
also be uh minuscule if any.
Minuscule if any. OK, Mr. Chair
Representative, but there would
be impact and I know this bill
is so concerned about the
children and I'm a mama and I
can't imagine anybody loving my
daughter and the children that I
have served in my community for
the past 22 years, more than me.
Can't imagine anyone five hours
away loving them more, so I'll
say this. Are you concerned
about the the parent's ability
to pay rent and purchase food.
for the children where their
jobs would be impacted, Mr.
Chair Representative.
Mr. Chair Representative, um,
this bill would not have any
impact on those issues that
you've raised. So Mister Chair
Representative, I want to
clarify none of the people's
jobs that work in oil and gas in
my community would be impacted
and their ability to pay rent or
put food on the table for their
children wouldn't be impacted,
you can guarantee that, Mr.
Chair Representative.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative, as
I said, I don't believe this
bill will have any impact on uh
employment, uh, or on jobs in
the oil and gas industry.
Thank you, Mr. Chair
Representative if you believe,
but we don't know for sure. And
like I said, nobody loves my
children in my community more
than I do as I've lived there
for the past 38 years, Mr. Chair
Representative, it'd be like me
coming to your backyard 5 hours
away and telling you how to do
business, Mr. Chair
Representative Cortez, I think
you've made the point about your
children. We appreciate that
point. Thank you so much I'd ask
you to move on.
if this whole bill is about the
the quality of life for
children, so I don't think I can
make that point clear enough
today, but thank you for
pointing that out, Mr. Chair
Representative, I'm gonna move
on to my next question. So you
speak about science where.
Um, I just want to share a
little bit of information. I
successfully defended my
dissertation and did a specific
study on a different topic in
New Mexico, and I had to use
specific location in New Mexico
to prove my study. So with that
being said, was this study that
you keep saying science was it
specifically conducted.
In New Mexico, was it
specifically conducted in Lee
County where I live, where the
most regulation would be
imposed.
Mr. Chair representative, there
are studies specific to your
corner of the state, um, showing
just how bad the air quality is
in your corner of the state,
including really high
dangerously high, um, benzene
levels, uh, in your corner of
the state. So my question, Mr.
Chair Representative, because I
study data entrance for a
living, was this a quantitative
study or a qualitative.
Study.
Uh, it was a, I believe a
quantitative study, Mister Chair
and Representative that was
presented to the water and
natural resources interim
committee, uh, during the fall.
Oh, that's awesome to hear, Mr.
Chair Representative, I also did
a quantitative study in the book
that I published, so
In that quantitative study, can
you share with us, Mr. Chair
Representative, what was the
statistical significance.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative, I
don't have that information with
me. What we do have is that
there are over 72 peer reviewed
studies showing the correlation
between risks to children's
health and proximity to oil and
gas production, Mister Chair
Representative, I feel like I am
the expert because I lived there
and I went to a school next to a
pumpjack, and my church was next
to a pumpjack, so did my
husband, so did our families, so
does my daughter.
And I would like to report to
everyone, we are alive and well
without any health
complications, Mr. Chair
Representative, this goes to my
next question, um, there is new
evidence about carcinogens in
foods like dyes and
preservatives is your expert
willing to state under oath that
these factors didn't cause any
illnesses in the children that
you're reporting that lives 5
hours away. So Santa Cortez, uh,
first of all, we're not.
oath. This is not a court
hearing.
And secondly Representative.
Excuse me. Were there doctors
involved for this study, Mr.
Chair Representative.
Res in San Cortez.
No one's under oath.
We're not talking about food
additives.
If you could keep your questions
to the Bill, I'd appreciate it.
Oh, Mister Chair Representative,
I assure you all of my questions
are pertinent to the bill
because if we say study show
science shows, I want to know
what studies. I want to know
what specific science. I want to
know where these peer reviewed
studies, are they accredited,
Mr. Chair Representative. Mr.
Chair Representative, I would be
happy to share what we shared
with the interim committee as
well as the legislative finance.
Committee, which is a summary of
the science, um, and I have a
copy of that here with me. I
could also email it to you.
These are peer reviewed studies
and are they accredited, Mister
Chair Representative
Representative tells you have to
let her answer the question.
studies, Mister Chair and
Representative, all showing the
likelihood of adverse health
income of adverse.
A health outcomes for people who
are in proximity to oil and gas
production. I'd be happy to
share that, um, with you. I
could hand you a copy if you'd
like one. Thank you so much, Mr.
Chair Representative, and again
I'm not just here, um,
representing District 62 and the
many concerns that I've had from
my district, but I'm a mama.
And my daughter is raised there,
so above all, I represent my
daughter and our families and
being that that the bill is
focused on the children's health
protection zones. I think it's
important to point out what oil
and gas has done for our
children. Oil and gas gave $2.3
billion in total funding for
education, Mr. Chair
Representative, and I'm, hold
on, I believe I still have the
floor, Mr. Chair representative
Senator Cortez, you do have the
floor, and I do have the ability
to direct the debate and I asked
you to stay on the bill.
Senator Cortez, you, you're back
on your being a mama.
It's been noted, it's
appreciated.
Representative Senator Cortez,
the impacts of the oil and gas
industry writ large or not
before us today. We had, uh, an
oil and gas industry
appreciation memorial.
That would have been a good time
to discuss that. This committee
on this bill is not a good time
to discuss that.
Representative. I also have the
committee handbook on page 20,
the committee handbook for the
New Mexico legislature. It also
talks about not being able to
limit debate. I can read that
verbatim if you'd like to, and
I'll finish my statements with
this, Mr. Chair Representative,
it's not just about being a mom,
being that it's focused on
children protection zones, it's
about represent the representing
the district 6.
2 of the people who elected me
and I will finish with this, Mr.
Chair Representative. Oil and
gas gave $2.3 billion in total
funding for education, that was
130,0508 students, 386 public
schools, 90,580 teachers. If
anybody loves children, as you
are proposing children
protection zones, I guarantee
you it is District 62 in Hobbs,
New Mexico.
Thank you so much, Mr. Chair and
Representative.
Montoya.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um
Just a
Question for Representative
Seana, uh.
This bill, does it apply?
Just to state and private lands
or is applied to federal lands
as well.
Um, Mr. Chairman, uh
representatives to all of the
state, but I'd like my expert to
to answer.
Yes, uh, Mr. Chair
Representative, it applies to uh
all the oil conservation
division grants a permit to
drill for all wells drilled in
New Mexico, uh, regardless of
land status, and they have
authority to put in health, uh,
protection zones, um, across the
state.
So, uh, thank you, Mr. Chair and
Representative Saana just to
note that I think this is gonna,
at least on federal lands, is
going to be at odds.
With certain executive orders
have just been signed.
Just
Just a side note, I just, um,
and I, and I do believe they
would have
Uh
Preeminence on this.
Um, just on federal lands.
Um
Mr. Chair.
And represented Serena.
Um
I was looking at
On the definitions, uh,
something uh maybe a little
problematic with the bill, and
that is on page 3.
And
Item F
If you look down at line 8.
It mentions pipelines.
And
Further down on
Page 4.
Item K
Uh, lines 13 and 14, when it's
talking about gas transportation
facility means a pipeline, so
pipelines mentioned again, but
I'd like to look down at the
bottom it says new language used
for the transportation.
Or consumption.
of natural gas.
Um, I, I believe one of the
unintended.
Consequences as well of this
bill is it would limit
Within 1 mile of a school.
The ability for new pipeline for
natural gas to go in.
To a community for
Uh,
Distribution because it says
like you said it it it the new
language says or consumption of
natural gas. So it's not just
For the purpose.
Uh, as related to.
Uh
So consumption would would talk
about something that would be
Uh, that has already been
refined and is going to
The public. So I, I believe an
unintended consequence here
would be that uh potentially a
school that would be built
couldn't even have a gas line go
to it for
The purpose of heating the
school also the
Um
Community surrounding it, it
could limit development.
Of
Holmes, which is a high priority
for us right now.
Uh
I, I just believe
That that might not be the
intent, but as I read it, an
argument could be made.
By folks that
Uh, natural gas, any natural gas
infrastructure.
That's the way I'm reading
transportation or consumption
means any natural gas
infrastructure.
Um
Yeah,
Mr. Chair Representative, thank
you for this question. It gives
us an opportunity to clarify if,
if you turn to page 15 of the
bill.
Um, which is the section that
actually establishes, um, the,
the setbacks or the health
protection zones around schools.
Um, section B online 13. The
division shall not approve a
permit to drill an oil or
natural gas gas well in a
children's health protection
zone, so the only thing this
bill.
bi t s is um permits to drill,
so as you know, I'm sure uh
Representative Mr. Chair, that
everyone puts in an operator
puts in an application for a
permit to drill.
Applications for permits to
drill will not be permitted or
they will not be approved if
they are within a children's
health protection zone. Those
changes to the definitions that
you pointed out, one is um the
gas transportation facility,
that's another one of those
cleaning up old language didn't
change the.
The definition just uh made the
definition clearer. It moved
language around. That was the
drafters from the Legislative
council service.
Um
And I'm not sure what Lavern is
pointing to, so I'm gonna let
Lavern.
the next Mr Cha and
representative, I, I'd just like
to add.
With respect to your concerns
about um natural gas pipelines
to schools or to homes that the
definition of production
facility, uh, specifically
defines.
Facilities or equipment
attendant to oil or gas
production or injection, so it
would not include those sorts of
uses
and representative. I then this
is a dead piece portion.
When you're talking about
consumption, that is a very
specific.
Uh, that is a processed.
Uh, that is processed, and so if
you, if this is not meant to be
On the other side of processing,
I would suggest that needs to
come out. Mr. Chair
Representative, that term
consumption in the definition of
gas transportation facility was
already in the definition. It's
already part of the Oil and Gas
Act. That's not a change, um, if
you look at the language that
was crossed out right above it.
It says transport transported or
used for consumption, and that
language has now just been moved
down to use for the
transportation or consumption of
natural gas. So this has long
been part of the Oil and Gas
Act, has nothing to do with this
bill and is not a change in a
definition,
and it is a change it because it
does cause the way it reads, uh,
is used for consumption.
This is used for the
transportation.
Or consumption. I, I do believe
it it the the changing around of
it, I believe, changed the
meaning. So I'll move on, but I
do believe that's something that
might need to be addressed. Um,
Mr. Chair.
And uh Representative Sareana.
Uh, it's been mentioned that
A letter was distributed.
Um
It's very interesting to me.
When you look at the folks, two
parts of this letter that I
would really like to point to,
Mr. Chair, are at the back of
the letter.
Are all
Of the setbacks and regulations
concerning oil and gas drilling.
And if you look at this list,
Mr. Chair,
Um, Aztec has
123456789.
123456789, 10.
Uh, specific.
Requirements
When it comes
Two drilling near a school.
Um, but Bloomfield has a couple
Edgewood, Carlsbad has, it looks
like 7 or 8 Farmington.
I'm from
Uh
Has
Over 10, Gallup has over 10
hobbs.
I can go down this list, loving
uh Lovington, Bernalillo County,
Eddy County, Ria Riba County.
They've all addressed this, and
When I'm looking at this letter,
which is suggesting, Mr. Chair,
and I would, I would
I'm gonna try and say this in
the softest way possible.
It feels like this is a piece of
legislation that is being done
to the community.
And not for the community.
Um, Mr. Chair, I believe it, if
this is something that was for
the community.
All, all of these communities
across the state that would be
affected.
That, that they should have
been.
part of the drafting of this.
Uh
Mr. Chair.
It really does come across as,
as if we know better than you.
You don't care for children is
kind of and and I'm kind of
repeating, I think.
To some degree, what
Representative Cortez was
saying.
It's it
It's kind of insulting. I, I
mean, I hate and once again, I'm
trying to to walk this line
where you don't gabble me down,
mister Chair, but it's kind of
insulting.
For folks
As I look at this, we have
mayors, county commissioners,
city councilors. We have, uh, I
have Farmington school
superintendent signed on to
this. We have several uh schools
that have signed on to this.
And it really does, and, and Mr.
Chair, this, this, this question
really is for representative
Sareana.
This
Something like this that is
going to be going to drastically
affect local communities.
I do not know why.
We would ignore local
communities in the drafting.
Of the legislation. And if there
is some very serious concerns
and there are are studies, Mr.
Chair, that, that
are saying in these communities.
The Health risks
to your children and to your
residents is very, very high.
I do not understand why you
would not.
Take those studies and say,
here, look at all these studies.
Are you aware of this?
And allow them
To respond, this this
This
To some degree
where once again, I've raised 4
boys. I have 6 grandchildren.
That are all
All around where I live is our
natural gas wells, pumps,
infrastructure.
And Mr. Chair, it's.
We're not seeing the types.
Of
Exaggerated health concerns that
That
This suggests
Where we do find
Exaggerated health concerns.
It's in the high poverty levels
of our county.
Where people are relying on coal
or wood fire in their homes.
For heat because they're poor.
Not because of the source.
And Mr. Chair, representative.
I don't know if you ever heard
the term that
causality and correlation are
not the same thing.
Something exists somewhere.
But then we make the point to
say the cause is this. I think
those are the studies we need to
see.
I, the, the reality is,
Uh, the particulates in each of
these counties.
That portion of air quality in
each of our counties.
It's very low.
Minus the homes.
That are burning
Wood
And coal, which is a high
percentage of San Juan County
for heat, and it's because of
the poverty.
So Mr. Chair and Representative,
I, I guess.
The, the real question is,
Why would you not?
Take studies, go to these
communities and say, let's look
at this together versus
We're gonna do this
Despite what and I've got, and
it's really despite what they
think.
Because this assigned.
Literally, I've got.
I got 5 pages here of people who
have signed on.
School districts.
County commissions and
And city councils.
That are in great opposition to
this because they know the
bigger issue is poverty.
At least in my county.
So
Maybe, maybe I rephrase this.
Would you be willing instead?
To come and engage them.
Rather than push through
something that they
are obviously against,
I did see the letter, um, I
didn't see any signatures. I
just saw names, but I assume
they were for it, um, yes, I
would definitely, and I was
gonna actually write back to you
I didn't finish my letter. I
will gladly go to any town hall
in any community and discuss
this bill and why we're doing
it. Um, I've seen Carl's bed at
his best. I did my student
teaching there. I was there for
5 months, not very long, but I
saw it when it was green and
beautiful.
We went for LESC not long ago
and
Anyway, um, yes, I would gladly
go and talk to anyone and
explain why we're doing it. You
have yet to bring up the effects
on children that that the gas
and oil industry has. That's why
we're doing this bill.
Cancer, asthma, nose bleeds, um,
pediatric, just deformities,
there's so much that that you
have not brought up yet in the
in the 7 year in the 9 years
I've been in this committee. I
have learned everything I have
presented to you. I've been on
legislative Finance Committee
where we have experts telling us
exactly what's going on in these
communities. We've traveled
there. I've been on legislative
education committees, if you
look at their FIR they talk
about exactly what's happening
to these kids, what can have the
potential.
The gas and oil industry and
they're emitting their um toxic
pollution is doing to these
kids, um, I'm on radioactive and
hazardous waste Committee. We
talk about this also and water
committee, that's where
Secretary Kennedy said 50 70% of
the of the of the um 73 73,000
wells are emitting pollution.
You can't deny that. These are
experts telling us this, and
you've probably been to these
committees also. So over 9
years, this is what I've
learned. This is why
bring the bill. As a teacher, we
don't teach kids to watch them
get sick, be absent so much they
can't learn. We teach kids so
that they'd have a, a good
quality of life and can.
Can grow in their life just,
it's just I get this is very
I'm very passionate about this.
I'm a mom, I'm a grandma, and I
was a teacher, so this is
important to me. I understand
gas and oil gives a lot of money
to our state. I know they buy
schools, they, they, they do all
kinds of good things, yes, but
they also have to take
accountability for what they're
doing to to the communities and
and you said during winter they
use coal and, and, and, but how
much of the time is it hot in
Karl's bed, and these are poor
communities. They look like me.
They are just as important as
every other community.
So I am here to protect the
kids. We are here. This bill is
for protecting the kids who have
who go to school within 1 mile
of a pumpjack or extraction
site. That's why we have this
bill.
Um, but I will gladly do a town
hall in any community to explain
why I'm doing this bill, the
effects of this bill, we will
show them the peer reviewed
studies on this bill. We did
talk, we did have an expert when
we were in Carlsbad.
Um, who actually has his um
site.
Professor, and, and, and, and
monitoring wells around loving.
Loving and, and they he showed
us the data on what's happening
there. So we have looked into
this 9 years of studying this,
um, you guys will all as
legislators learn a whole lot.
We have experts in so many
areas, so that's why I bring
this bill, representative.
So Mr. Chair and and
Representative, I guess.
What you're hearing from us.
On this, on the, let's say the
opposite side of the aisle.
Is that you're trying to tell us
that you have studies.
And we have to disbelieve our
own eyes.
We're having to disbelieve our
own experience.
We're having to disbelieve.
In our communities where we're
not seeing
Extra cancer. We're not seeing,
we're not seeing that.
It just isn't happening.
But there's studies, and that's
why, that's why there's so many
questions and maybe members on
this side were, were a little
harsh on
What's, what's the study? Where
did it come from? Who paid for
it? Those are, those are
questions we do have.
Because the reality is, somebody
like myself who was a, a youth
pastor for years, who worked in
the coal mines for 32 years.
Whose family worked in the
extractive industries of oil and
gas production.
My entire life.
And coached. I coached.
27 different.
Little League teams.
In my lifetime.
We're not seeing what you're
saying.
It's not happening. However,
there are studies.
And I'm gonna put quotations
around that, because it doesn't
match our lived experience. So,
Mister Chair, where this becomes
preaching to us is.
Or to believe you.
Rather than our own eyes. That
is a hard sell.
Mr. Chair
Mr. Chairman, can I just, you're
right, you can't see it. We saw
it through optical readers from
people who brought these so we
could look through these and we
could see the emissions. You
could see the flaring and the
venting all over in Karl's
Vandenhos, which is supposed to
be used for emergencies, but
through the optical reader you
could see the, the, the
emissions coming out, but, and,
and when we were there we we
went on a tour the emissions
were going straight to this
community of homes. I just
thought maybe they do they not
understand? Maybe they haven't
seen it through the optical
reader, but we have.
a bill to buy more of those just
for your counties so they can be
educated on what is happening to
them, what pollution is being
emitted from every kind of every
kind every area. So yeah, you
may not be able to see it, but
it is there, and if you really
want to see it, get one of those
optical optical um cameras and
uh look through them, you'll see
the emissions. So Mr. Chair and
Representative, I'm not
disputing that there's not
methane in, in the air.
Mr. Chair, I, I worked at a coal
mine which produced coal bed
methane. It just is in the air,
regardless of the production of
oil and gas, it's just in our
air in San Juan County. What I'm
saying is we're not seeing.
The
Instances of asthma, as has been
stated, other than where we know
the asthma exists and that's
where people are burning.
Wood and coal. We see it there.
We do not see it widespread. We
do not see the cancer in those
levels as so, Mr. Chair and,
and, and uh representative, if
we were to have a study in our
communities that was
specifically for our
communities, that would be worth
it. But uh I, and Mr. Chair and
and representative, I, I, I
watched uh a movie years ago
called uh Aaron Brockovich.
And in that movie, people were
being poisoned. People were
being ignored. People were going
out there and
In San Juan County,
That is not the case.
That's not happening. It is not
happening.
And on top of that, Mr. Chair,
And representative Serana.
If that were happening, and our
local officials were ignoring
it. They'd be run out of town on
a rail.
So
I appreciate that you love
children. I, I do not dispute
that.
For 1 2nd.
What I do dispute
Is that somehow you love our
children more than we do. That I
do not accept, um, Mister Chair.
Representative Dixon.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um,
Thank you, uh, Representative
Sareana and uh Miss Evans.
I have a couple of questions,
um.
Around uh setback distances.
Um
Mr. Chair, um, how did
How did you determine the
distance, uh, that's in this
bill.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative.
We determined it by looking at
the science and seeing that the
vast majority of the science
showed a distances from a mile
or further, um.
Some, there are studies saying,
um, in other places have put in
place health buffer zones of 1
kilometer, which, as you know,
is about 0.6 of a mile, but
those same, uh, studies say that
for vulnerable populations such
as children that you would need
more than that. And so this
seemed like a very modest
proposal. Um, I can read to you.
I just take the time. I don't
want to take.
The time of Mister Chair, but I
mean I have all these studies in
front of me, uh, talking about
the distances of at least 1
mile, um, showing uh that you're
5 to 6 children are 5 to 7 more
times likely to develop lymphoma
than children who aren't, um,
you know, who are further than 1
mile. Um, studies showing that
uh if you're 10 kilometers uh
from oil and gas development
during pregnancy.
See, um, you have a higher risk
of having a child with a birth
defect.
I think that answered the
question.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank
you, Ms. Evans. Um, what is the
setback distance uh in Colorado.
I believe it's uh Mr. Chair and
Representative, I believe it's
0.5 mile. I don't have it in
front of me, uh, Ms. Evans, it
is 2000 ft. Um, Mr. Chair, Ms.
Evans, what is the setback
distance in the state of
California?
Uh, Mr. Chair and
Representative, it's a
kilometer, and, but I'd like to
explain that it, I believe in
both of those places. Those are
not um just around schools.
Those are broader setbacks that
are around, um, places that
people frequent. It quite
broadly defined.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Ms. Evans. But regardless, it is
um not 52.
5280 ft. It is, uh, shorter than
that. Um, what is the setback
distance in the state of
Pennsylvania?
Representative Dixon, if you
have that information, you can
share it with.
Oh,
Mr. Chair, representative, I'm
sorry, we do have a list and I'm
happy to discuss it, uh, I
believe it's 500 ft. Thank you,
Mr. Chair, thank you, Ms. Evans.
It is 500 ft. Um, and Mr. Chair,
Ms. Evans, do you know how those
states uh made their
determination on what distance
to put into statute.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative, I,
I do not. I assume it was the
legislative process or
rulemaking process, um, as we
have here in our state.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Chair, um, in
the LESC analysis.
Um, so there were 2,
Agency analysis that I was
particularly interested in. One
was from the public education
department and one was from the
legislative Education Study
Committee.
Um, in the LESC.
Analysis, um, you know, and, and
I don't think that there's any
dispute.
Uh, by any of us, um, that
they're can be.
Um, and our, um, health impacts.
Um, however, um, Mr. Chair, Ms.
Evans, I would like to focus in
on the discussion of youth
asthma hospitalizations by
county.
Um, and I'm
Curious, Mister Chair and Ms.
Evans, uh, what is the state
average?
Uh, for youth asthma
hospitalizations by county, uh,
per 10,000 population.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative, I
believe you're looking at data
that's from 2017 to 2021. That
is correct and um oil and gas
production has, um, doubled.
Uh, in the last, I believe, 6
years. So, uh, an emissions, uh,
have also uh drastically
increased.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, thank
you, Ms. Evans. So does that
mean that you actually have, um,
Air quality tests from around
all of these schools.
From those sites specifically.
From those schools, uh,
Mr. Chair Representative, we
don't have air quality tests
from those sites around all
those schools. We do have air
quality testing that was done
around the librick Elementary,
um, a state school out in the
eastern Agency, which showed it
was the, the testing was done
right at the school. It showed
um fencing levels that were off
the charts, um, higher benzene
readings in a day than you
should get in a lifetime.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, um, and
thank you, Ms. Evans, and that
is one out of how many schools,
uh, that would be affected by
this.
Uh, what, Mr. Chair
Representative, as I said, we
only have the air quality
readings from one school, but we
do, we are very familiar with
the air quality in general in
the counties of the state that
have high oil and gas production
in that air quality is not
healthy. Sure, thank you, Mr.
Chair and Ms. Evans. Um,
The reason that I was asking
that though, if you have this
specific sites is because you
were, you seem to have been
expressing concern about the
fact that the data that I'm
referencing, which is the data
that was used by our education
study committee was from 2017 to
2021. But what I'd like to make
sure that uh we discussed is the
fact that the state average is
9, and interestingly, of the 5
counties that are referenced in
this table, Mr. Chair.
Um, and Ms. Evans, the highest
county, so they looked at
Chavez, Lee, Rio Riba, San Juan,
and Eddie.
Chavez County had the highest.
And yet, am I correct that among
these counties, and I'm just
going off my.
You know, my sort of, um, I
don't have the data in front of
me, but my anecdotal knowledge.
Chavez County is one of, is not
as high producing as Leor Eddie.
That's, is that correct?
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative, I
believe so. So, Mr. Chair, Ms.
Evans, what are other factors
that could have caused.
Chavez County to have over
almost 3 times.
The rate of the state average.
Is it other, I mean, are there
other factors that could have
played a part in that?
Other than oil and gas
production, Mister Chair
Representative, certainly, and
Chavez County is also a very uh
heavy dairy county. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. um, thank
you. Speaking of dairy, Mr.
Chair, um, and Ms. Evans, how
many dairies are located within
1 mile of schools in Chavez
County.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative, I
don't know.
Mr. Chair, Ms. Evans, thank you.
I'd be really interested to know
that, um, and also their
site-specific air quality. Um,
Mr. Chair, Ms. Evans, um,
Further in this analysis from
LESC. It says,
However, Eddie and San Juan
counties have lower than average
rates of youth asthma
hospitalization.
Uh, Mr. Chair, um, Ms. Evans, I
also want to tie the fact that
um these youth asthma
hospitalizations are also a
factor when we're looking at
chronic absenteeism.
Um, and
We know chronic absenteeism, um,
plays, uh, right now, a very
large factor in our school
success rates.
Um
But if you continue on to page
4,
Figure 2
Is the percent of students that
are chronically absent.
And
LESC, and I quote, chronic
absence rates in schools within
1 mile of active oil and gas
operations tend to be lower.
And other New Mexico schools,
particularly in recent years.
Mr. Chair, Ms. Evans, I just
found that to be interesting.
Um, and therefore,
Um
HB 35 addresses one root cause
of chronic absence, but is
unlikely to significantly affect
absent.
Uh, sorry, affects chronic
absenteeism at the statewide
level.
Um
Mr. Chair, um.
Ms. Evans, um,
And this may be a question for
um Representative Saraana.
Um, I appreciate the
conversation that we had, uh,
for Elliot for LFC.
In Karl's bed this summer.
Um, and I also appreciate the.
Feedback that we have heard
today, uh or not heard uh.
But seen from the
representatives of the local
communities.
Um, that have expressed concern.
So my question, um, other
members have asked if you
coordinated, uh, with
Local elected officials,
including mayors, county
commissioners, city councilors,
or school board members, um, but
I'm wondering, um, if you
reached out to and talked to any
current um oil and gas operators
to discuss what the impact of
this distance.
Would be on their operations.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative, I
have not.
Mr.
Chit chair, I mean, Mr.
Chairman, uh representative
before we went for L LFC before
we went to Carl's but I did
reach out to all the city
councilors to meet with them,
and I only get one response from
the from the um mayor and
unfortunately we didn't end up
being able to meet, so I did try
to talk to them. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you, Representative Saraana. I
very much appreciate that, and I
know, um, that
You know, a lot of times we do
reach out to folks and they
don't get back to us and.
And that is a, a problem. Um,
you know, that I myself have,
have not.
Sometimes contribute to as well.
Um
The reason though that I ask if
you, Mr. Chair, Ms. Evans.
If you coordinated or talked
with any current operators.
Um, Mr. Chair, I appreciate
that, you know, this bill is not
Um, necessarily about the
economic impact, um,
Of setbacks. Um, obviously, the
FIR uh provided.
Um, good information, and I
really, I value, um, the
analyses that our economists and
staff at LFC do.
Um, however,
I'm curious about current
operators because in the, I
believe it's in the, no, it's
the LESC analysis, sorry, there
is a table.
Um, that shows oil and gas
operations within 1 mile of
schools.
And Mr. Chair, um,
Panel
The table shows, you know,
there's really a wide range of
difference, um, and how this
could affect.
Um, there are 52 different
operators listed.
Um, some operators, Mr. Chair,
panel, uh, would have 100% of
their operations affected.
Um
There's one that would have 60%,
30%, um, and some, uh, actually
0%, right? Um, but
Mr. Chair and panel, I do think
that.
Well, uh, Miss, uh, Tana Cortez,
uh.
Expressed her love and
appreciation for her children,
which I think is parents, uh, we
all do.
Um, and the intent of this bill
is to protect.
Our children. Um, I do think
that it is a fair and valid
point as to whether or not
families in these communities
could be adversely affected.
By these setbacks.
Um, I think that's a perfectly
fair question to ask if a
company um might have reduced
ability to drill, and if they
might have to lay off employees.
I just want to say
representative Mr. Chair.
Every family in those
communities are being effective
when 70% of the industry is
polluting beyond the legal limit
and breaking the law. Every
single person in that community,
in those communities, 70%,
that's almost 51,000 wells
polluting beyond the legal
limits, so we are just looking
at schools, but every, every
single person is being affected
by this industry, breaking the
law and polluting beyond the
legal limit.
And Mr. Chair, I, if I could
just answer the question as
well, um, Mr. Chair and
Representative, I believe the
chart you're referring to,
Representative Dixon.
Um
is with the LESC's report.
And those operators that you're
talking about one operator has
one well, and that one well is
within 1 mile of school, so that
would affect 100% of their
operation.
Another operator has one well
that one well with is with
within a mile of schools, so
this would affect 100% of their
operators rations. Another
operator that would be affected
100% has, I believe 5 wells, and
the last one has one well.
So we're talking about 8 wells.
Of those operators would be 100%
affected.
We're not saying those
operators, they can continue
operating those 8 wells. This
bill does not shut down those 8
wells. It just means that they
have to comply with the leak
detection plan and comply with
the law which they should be
doing already. And if those
operators want to do further
production in our state, they
would have to do it outside of
that mile, so they'd have to put
their well.
mile away from the property.
Um, and that's, that would be
true for everyone, but no one's
wells are being shut down by
this bill.
Um, Mr. Chair and Ms. Evans. So
even if, if they haven't a well
within the 1 mile, and I do
appreciate you going through um
the various, um,
Companies. Um, but what if they
have
Area that they could still drill
on, if they have a lease.
In that area.
Within that 1 mile. They,
they've invested in that land
and have a lease.
So then, uh, Mr. Chair,
Representative, they would have
if, if they have a lease and
they have want to apply for a
permit to drill, and they want
to apply to drill within the
children's Health protection
zone, they would have to seek a
variance, and they would show
the oil conservation division
that this would have a severe
economic impact on them if
they're not permitted to drill
close to a school, and they
Conservation division could
allow them to continue and drill
close to the school.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Ms. Evans. Um,
I think that
This still goes back to my
concern that.
You know,
Not all stakeholders were
Engaged to the extent that um.
I think they perhaps ought to
have been. Um, however, um,
Mr. Chair and um Ms. Evans, um,
How many hours a day do children
spend in school?
to take that question.
Most spend 6.5 hours. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Representative. And how many
children live within.
Have their residences within 1
mile of a oil and gas well,
Madam Chair, Mr. Chairman,
representative, I tried to get
that information from DOH and
from this other database
synchronous, but I was not able
to get that information.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Representative. I appreciate
that. Um, because I, I do think
that that's also, um, an
important consideration. Um, and
I also, Mr. Chair
Representative, appreciate your,
the
Concern with the numbers for uh
the Permian region, the 70%, um,
although.
Um, I think that, um, based on
the.
Um, press release from
The New Mexico Environment
Department.
Um
I need to do a little bit more
uh digging into exactly, um.
The, uh, what that data means
because I'm not.
Sure that it means 70%, but um
I'll take some time and, and
look through that.
Um
Mr. Chair, uh.
Ms. Evans, what are other, uh,
major sources of respiratory
symptoms, uh.
For school children.
That could be found at the
school.
Uh, Mr. Chair, Representative,
I'm not, I'm not, I don't know.
I mean, I'm sure there's lots of
other causes. Um, I don't think
those causes undermine the clear
science that's showing that oil
and gas pollution uh leads to
respiratory illness. And I do
want to point out that earlier
in the LESC study that you were
discussing, the LSC LESC clearly
states that HB 35 would
contribute to positive health
outcomes for New Mexico students
and goes on to speak about the
p.
Reviewed research that is linked
emissions from oil and gas
operations to negative health
impacts for children, with
particular emphasis on
neurological development and
respiratory health.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Ms. Evans. Um, so some of the
other factors, um, for
respiratory symptoms. And, and
this is just respiratory. I
mean, we could, I'm sure go
through a list of all of the
other, um, health concerns, um,
but.
Uh, lack of air filtration
systems overcrowded classrooms,
deferred building maintenance,
uh, local climate conditions,
construction dust, um, and it,
and the list goes on. Um,
Mr. Chair, uh.
Representative, is there still
the requirement in the
substitute for um producers to
um
Address the dust.
particulates from the roads.
Mr. Chairman, yes, there is,
Madam representative.
Thank you. Um, thank you, Mr.
Chair. Thank you,
Representative. Um, are there,
um, restrictions on, uh, are we
gonna address in other, in any
other way, uh, road conditions
that are not.
Um
To and from an oil and gas well,
but are within 1 mile.
Of the schools?
Mr. Chair Representative, no.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, thank
you.
Um
Mr. Chair and panel, I, um,
Very much appreciate the intent
of this bill and I have
benefited from the discussion,
um, that we have been having
this morning. Um, I think that
there are a lot of factors, um.
That go into consideration of.
Yeah
This bill and
You know, my perspective on it,
um.
Mr. Chair and, and
Representative, um, I appreciate
and applaud.
The concerned and the leadership
that.
Um
You have in the state for
supporting um
Children, our next generation
and students. Um, I have.
Concerns about the lack of
stakeholder engagement, um, the
distance that is proposed in
this.
Bill, as compared to distances.
Um, that I think we could find
any sort of scientific peer
reviewed article, um, to let us
know whether it's 300, 500,
2000, 3000 or 5200, um.
So
Um
You know, I'm gonna continue to
listen to the, the rest of the
questions. I think that the
significance of this bill is,
um, I don't think that anyone
can say that this is a, uh, vote
to simply support children, um,
in a, um, protection zone, I
think that would be um.
I think that would be blatantly
false for anyone to suggest
that, um, a vote is simply for
or against children. Um, thank
you, Mr. Chair.
Represented small.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Thank you to the um
To the presenters and thanks to
the audience. I know the
microphones, we still have that
issue. Um, so.
We're all bearing through that
in addition to other things.
Mr. Chair, uh, presenters, I
want to first talk a little bit
about PFOS. That seems to be a
particular focus in this bill.
Is that right, Ms. Evans?
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative, I
don't believe so.
Mr. Chair, uh,
Sanana and Miss Evans. So he
fought the water quality testing
and many of those pieces, that's
not focused on POS in the bill.
Am I reading it incorrectly?
Mr. Chair Representative, no,
uh, there is the, the washer
quality testing is a requirement
of the bill, um, and PAST would
be part of that as, as, as well
as many other constituents. Yes.
Thank you, Evans, and it seems
like uh am I not seeing that
PFOS is specifically mentioned
while there may be many
different contaminants.
Uh, PAS is
It is included in the substitute
legislation.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
just find the page, sorry, uh,
Mr. Chair Representative, maybe
you could refer to the page
you're on. I think as we go
through, I'll sort of come
around there, Mr. Chair, um, the
A with regard to PFOS and the
requirement to test.
I first want to sort of point
out and make sure that we're on
the same page.
Right now, Mr. Chair.
And Miss Evans, the largest um
Sort of purveyor of POS and the
source of the vast majority of
PFOS pollution in New Mexico,
maybe around the country is the
Department of Defense. Would you
agree or disagree?
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
yes, but I apologize because I
still um not sure what part of
the bill where you're seeing
because I don't see that in the
washer, uh, testing.
Section
And I might be misunderstanding
something that you're referring
to.
Thanks, Mr. Jarrod. Thank you,
Ms. Evans. I, I, in the
presentation, I believe that you
all
Uh, you've referenced PFOS as
one of the contaminants.
Uh, during the presentation.
And Mr. Chair, so we agree that
the Department of Defense
I
So far, the sort of largest
purveyor of POS pollution. Also,
Mr. Chair, Ms. Evans, um, I've
seen reporting that suggests
PFOS in the past has been used
across a wide range of areas,
including sort of with relevance
here and like ski wax, for
example.
Would you have
Would you agree with that? And
if you've seen the same
reporting suggesting that PFOS
In the past has been used.
Across a wide variety of
commercially available products.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
I'm not an expert on PAS and
PASTs are not, um, explicitly
set forth in this bill, but I
would assume that what you're
saying is correct.
OK. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank
you, uh, Ms. Evans. So one of
the, I guess it sort of leads me
in two places around the, the
water quality testing.
Specifically
It seems like there could be a
worry that
There is PFOS in
Uh, water systems. And we know
this again, mostly related to
Department of Defense.
a stakeholder might draw a
conclusion that says we need to
move.
Uh, various things, schools,
places of business, etc. a mile
or more from every single
Department of Defense side and
state of New Mexico, since
they're the ones with PFOS
located on them.
Mr. Chair Representative, I'm
looking at the water quality
testing section of the bill.
Says water quality testing shall
include testing for total
dissolved solids, total
petroleum hydrocarbon as crude
oil, Major cats, Major anions, a
by the
washer Quality Control
Commission appropriate indicator
chemicals for drilling mud and
fluids used for well clean out,
total alkaline alkalinity and
hydroxide, electrical
conductance pH and temperature.
OK, so then, uh, it was sort of
the talk about PFOS in the
presentation at the beginning of
the bill, is that less
important? It will PFOS not be
one of the things.
That need be uh looked at during
in this enhanced water quality
testing regime.
Um, um, Mr. Chairman and
Representative, in
presentations, and I believe it
was in LESC LFC, um, Abner
talked about Amner and um.
Talked about PAS is used in the
injection process. They have
seen it. They, when they
injected it, it does come out
it's part of the chemicals that
come out, so it has been
referenced in our committee
meetings as far as being part of
the chemicals that they they
they find out when it comes back
the backwash of that backflow of
it. OK, thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative
Sareana and, and Miss Evans, any
maybe PFOS is part of the
already sort of determined list
that the water quality control
commission.
S4.
Is that why it's not called out
in the bill, or is that, is it
less of a concern?
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative P.
Fassor, a, a big concern, but
they are not called out uh in
this bill and um I, I, I know
there's other legislation moving
through uh this session
concerning testing for and
identifying PFASS, and I agree
with what representative
Sarayana said that it has been
clearly identified that PASs are
used for fracking in New Mexico.
7.
It, the source of POS pollution
that and I've read the same
articles, I'm sure many in this
room have.
Uh, around Alamogordo, for
example, incredibly, perhaps the
highest levels in wildlife that
have been reported. That is
sourced to the Department of
Defense facilities, is it not?
Represent small
So, um, Miss Evans is right. We
do have 2 PFOS bills coming up
on, um, probably Saturday. Um, I
don't think it's the primary
focus of the bill.
Um, I, I, I think there's a lot
of concern around Pfiles if you
have a point, you could draw out
shortly. I'd appreciate it.
Totally fair. Thank you, Mr.
Chair and Ms. Evans. So I guess
my point here is that what could
be seen to be the enhanced water
quality testing requirements.
In the variance process.
I find it pretty easy to imagine
a situation where water is
contaminated.
From sources that are
Widely varied.
Whether it's a Department of
Defense facility, whether it's a
wastewater treatment plant.
Whether it's a um
Another source.
In this bill.
It seems like that liability
would
could be sort of solely placed.
On the oil and gas producer.
And that there would be little
if no way to sort of prove the
source of that pollution.
Or the water quality standard.
Mr. Chair Representative of the
bill calls for baseline testing,
so it's essentially testing
before the drilling and then
after the drilling to attempt to
address that issue.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Ms. Evans. That's helpful. What
about for the uh enhanced regime
for the existing infrastructure.
The 800 wells that you site.
And the existing
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
the bill says that um to receive
a permit to drill. So if this is
for um
The, the extra uh washer quality
testing is for people who, um,
are doing drilling with a
variance, um, after this bill
goes into place, and before they
drilled, they would have to test
if they were requested to do so
by the local community and after
they drill, they would have to
test.
Got it. OK. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Thank you, Ms. Evans. Uh,
and so there's sort of no effect
on the existing 800 wells. Is
that right?
I believe that the washer
quality sampling and testing
section, uh, as I, it states
that to receive a permit to
drill from the division under an
exception in the Oil and Gas
Act, they shall provide notice
and, and there is then when the
property owner or can request
the testing. Got it. Thank you,
Mr. Chair, Ms. Evans, and I
just, I'll ask this one more
time, we can go through, but for
the existing wells.
That are in place now.
Is there sort of where there's
not really a baseline that can
be established prior to that
drilling and production.
What effect?
It would uh.
sort of accrue to them in this
bill.
Uh, there for existing wells,
there is, um, a section
requiring a chemical analysis of
produced water.
Um, and I believe that that
sampling has to occur when the
operator wants to carry the
produced water away from the
site. Got it. OK. Thank you, Mr.
Cha. Thank you, Ms. Evans. Um,
And so that is
Yeah, I, I'll, I'll have a few,
it's an area I think is sort of
lay out my thinking there, Mr.
Chair, Ms. Evans. I appreciate
the ability to go deeper and
appreciate your answers. The,
um, and I appreciate the process
that's provided sort of for new
drilling and production.
Uh, appreciate the answer
regarding sort of existing
production, a concern largely as
we go through this legislative
session, is that to sort of
take the
Very real challenges posed by
PFOS.
And ascribe all of the
responsibility to one industry.
To me, that'll be something I
call that that just strikes me
as not accurate and not
representative of sort of the
current situation.
I appreciate the answers as to
the legislation.
Moving forward, Mr. Chair, um,
So
If we adopt this sun today.
There will be a new fiscal
analysis that is generated.
By the LLC.
Um, is that's your
understanding, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, uh, Mr. Chair and
Saana, I think
The reason I say that is because
we have some
Very conflicting sorts of um
Fiscal analysis, uh, industry
stakeholder analysis suggesting
much higher impact.
The LSC analysis.
found the original bill that
suggested a significantly lower
impact.
Um
Mr. Chair, Representative, my
understanding there's two
committees following this
committee for this piece of
legislation.
And so we would expect in the
next committee, um, additional
analysis to come forward if the
Mr. Chair, that is correct, but
I would also add that the
changes in the bill,
It
did not change. Like no new
requirements were added in the
bill, um, instead requirements
were removed from the oil
conservation to the Environment
department.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Ms. Evans. That's true. Although
Mr. Chair, Ms. Evans.
We should expect that and this
will go into a couple of other
questions.
should expect
At the environment department
with their enhanced regulatory
responsibilities would have,
would potentially have a new
duties imposed upon them.
this bill.
Mr. Chair Representative, um,
that is correct, but it's our
understanding from speaking with
the um oil conservation division
that in fact the impact on the
agencies, the two agencies'
budgets is actually less with
the committee said.
Because we're not giving the oil
conservation division, a new
line of work.
Um, and so we were told it was
actually cheaper to implement
the bill along the lines of the
committee, so got it. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Thank you, Ms. Evans.
Um
So, uh, OK. Uh, so moving into
Uh, is there sort of an official
position from enemy and OCD as
regards the substitute
legislation.
Mr. Chair Representative, the
substitute legislation, um,
Uh, counselor puts in place
almost all of the suggestions
that we received from OCD and
NMED.
And, Mr. Chair, Miss Evans does
that, um,
Is, is it a, you know, is there
sort of support opposition.
Neutrality or at this point sort
of no statement from the
agencies.
Um, Mr. Chair Representative, I
would say no statement.
OK. Thank you, Mr. Cha. Thank
you, Ms. Evans.
Um
I guess, you know, I, I
key question
In your opinion, Miss Evans, Mr.
Chair.
Will this improve?
in these communities.
Mr. Chair Representative, yes.
Mr. Chair Representative.
And that's
sort of well it lower pollution
from levels it's at now.
Will it prevent future pollution
from sort of accruing in what
way will it and, and actually,
Mr. Chair, Ms. Evans, this is
sort of another question. Are
there other areas
particularly in a state that is,
as we have the seen rapidly uh
increased production.
Are there areas that we should
look at funding with state
dollars to get more granular
data about all sorts of things
including health.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative, I
believe that both of the
agencies that are in charge of
regulating oil and gas in the
state need uh a significant
increases in their budgets, so
that they can uh fully enforce
the acts, um, and monitor and
regulate the industry.
That Mr. Chair, uh, Miss Evans.
I'll come back to that part,
which I
I think we can share and
celebrate good news from the
perspective that this
legislature and this executive
have increased funding for the
Environment department. I think
it's 170% from 2019.
Uh, and
Has seen over 100% growth. Would
you agree that those are large
increases in investment.
Mr. Chairman, Representative,
yes, yes, we would, but there
were also many years where they
didn't get anything, so this is
kind of just trying to get them
up to where they should be, and
we're not there yet, Mr. Chair,
I agree and I want to applaud
your leadership, particularly in
that space.
Uh, Mr. Chair, Ms. Evans,
Though a question that comes to
me is
Is there more research needed
and this would not be through as
much maybe our enforcement
agencies as maybe through the
Department of Health, maybe in
conjunction with um our some of
our other academic partners. Do
we know all we need to know
about.
Um
The potential health impacts,
good and bad, of various things
including oil and gas
production.
Or is there more that we need to
learn, Mr. Chair and Ms. Evans,
and that we might consider
dedicating state resources to
asking and finding.
Uh, yeah.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
yes, I think communities
definitely need support, um, for
them to be able to identify the
pollutants in their community
and, um, they need support, uh,
from the state, uh, in terms of
being protected from those
pollutants.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Ms. Evans. Um, with regard to
now go and sort of
We've seen this increase in
production.
There has been sort of a rapid
rise, Mr. Chair, Ms. Evans, and
things like truck traffic and
other
Well, really that, right?
Rapid, massive increases in
vehicular traffic.
Does that contribute to some of
the adverse health effects, or
could that contribute to some of
the adverse health impacts.
Um, Mr. Chair Representative,
certainly, uh, the truck traffic
and the emissions from trucks
that are related to the oil and
gas industry as well as the dust
that's drawn up on the bad roads
that are in areas of high oil
and gas production, um, is, uh,
is a big concern in terms of air
quality, and I believe um
there's someone in the room,
Daniel So, uh, who would be
happy to speak to that in terms
of
All of those are impacts from,
uh, oil and gas production.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, Ms. Evans,
and Ms. Evans,
Those same sort of vehicular
impacts are around.
Uh, in other parts of the state,
not associated with oil and gas
production. But the
Is it, are we seeing sort of
adverse health impacts.
From vehicular traffic and other
parts of the state near.
Uh, near
Near children's schools and
other places where they
congregate.
Um, Mr. Chair Representative,
I'm not sure I fully understand
your question, but oil and gas
production comes with increased
vehicular uh air pollution, uh,
both from the emissions and from
the dust,
Evans.
Uh, let, can we agree that one
of the sources of that vehicular
pollution is related to, for
instance, um, sort of take, uh,
moving, removing, uh, produce
water. Would you agree that
that's one of the uh, Mr. Chair
Representative, yes. Chair,
Evans, would you not then agree
that a pipeline that conveys
that water without vehicular
traffic would reduce uh would
reduce that vehicular traffic in
that.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative, I
believe so, yes.
And so Mr. Chair or Ms. Evans, I
think that um that
Helps illustrate for me some of
the
talent infrastructure challenges
and opportunities.
Um
Within oil and gas production
separately, Mr. Chair, Ms.
Evans.
I note that the vast majority of
school kiddos in the state of
New Mexico live outside of oil
and gas producing regions.
And their health and whether
there are impacts related to
vehicular traffic and other
emissions.
I of
The utmost importance in Mister
Chair, Miss Evans, I would also
observe that
One of the unique
Challenges and opportunities for
our legislature at this time
with such strong.
Budget
Is the ability to, to invest in
communities in ways that the
state has never had. Would you
agree, Mr. Chair, Ms. Evans?
Uh, Mr. Chair of Representative,
I think what's key in those
investments, uh, and in the
money where those investments
come from is making sure that
people aren't being harmed and
production, uh, emissions from
oil and gas in New Mexico are
actually the greatest source of
uh air pollution in our state,
even greater than emissions from
the vehicles that we drive, and
that makes us different from
other
places in the country where the
greatest source of air pollution
is actually the vehicles that we
drive,
Evans,
in the southeast part of the
state. I have no doubt that
that's true, Mr. Chair, Ms.
Evans. That's also a part of the
state, the geographically we
share with the heaviest
producing part of Texas in the
Texas part of the Permian and
the um
The Midland, uh, Midlands, uh,
Midland and Permian.
So
Mr. Chair, Miss Evans.
The source of pollution for the
for most.
Kiddos in New Mexico.
I vehicular as opposed to
production. Would you agree,
Mr. Chair Representative, this
bill is focused on the areas of
the state that have heavy oil
and gas production because only
in those areas of the state are
their wells within 1 mile of a
school, and so you're correct
that most schools in our state
like the schools in, uh,
Albuquerque, where my children
went to Albuquerque public
schools. There's no concern.
about oil and gas wells being
near those schools
and said I won't spend too long
here, but I think it helps.
You know, as we, as we're in
this session, the idea of
leveraging revenue gained from
production to help clean up
whether it's build that pipeline
that takes away the need for a
truck to and from a production
site, or whether it's, you know,
light and medium duty uh
electric vehicles or other
emissions-free vehicles that
take that air pollution away,
whether it's from the, the
school in Southeast, the school
in the South Valley of
Albuquerque, anywhere in the
state.
Those are
Well, not the sole subject of
this legislation is fair.
They are very much have are on
the front and center of my mind
is we uh work through.
This legislative session. And
that's, I'm not, that's sort of
My statement of sort of
explaining some uh some of my
thought process. Do you have
anything to add, Mr. Chair, Ms.
Evans. Well, Mr. Chair
Representative, I'm just, I
don't believe that those are
things that are impacted by this
bill. Um, this bill allows the
production, those 800 wells that
are already there to continue,
and this bill says that it
disallows new production, so it
would get all of those things,
the pipeline and the truck
traffic a mile away.
From the schools.
Mr. Chair, uh, Ms. Evans.
Thank you for that.
However, on the fiscal analysis
as we, if we, if and as we go
forward in the session.
I think this is my observation,
Mr. Chair. There will be other,
there, there are other pieces of
legislation in this legislative
session.
That could in a very short time
frame.
Rapidly impact production, which
would
Of oil and gas, which would
rapidly impact this
legislature's ability to invest
in electric vehicles.
And other sorts of
infrastructure, and sort of say
it to explain my thought process
there. Um,
The
Don't know that I have too many,
so, yeah.
Um
I'll be, Mr. Chair, Ms. Evans,
oh, actually one other thing,
uh, and I, and I've shared this
offline with Representatives
Sarayana, who again I want to
really praise for the work
around increasing agency
budgets, which we've been able
to do as a legislature robustly
over the last few years. Um,
there is, so the New Mexico
Environment Department, um,
With funding this legislature is
provided as stepped up
enforcement.
And monitoring in ways that they
were simply unable to do before,
uh,
Because of lack of funding. Um,
124 facilities inspected in
April of 2024.
And these were facilities that
were sort of chosen, as I
understand from the New Mexico
environment.
Sweets
Based upon sort of looking to
find from an enforcement
perspective.
Um
60% were found out of
compliance.
Uh, NMED goes on to say, well,
that 60% figure doesn't reflect
all oil and gas facilities in
New Mexico, sort of.
Maybe pausing our conclusion
about
How all facilities are
operating. They do not
surprisingly, say it clearly
demonstrates the need for more
resources to be put forward.
Wars holding polluters
accountable.
Um, so that's just, I point that
out, Mr. Chair, Representative
Soignana to sort of
Um
Add information to our
Uh
help inform our conclusion about
is compliance within industry
going up? Is it going down? Is
it sort of staying the same?
It seems like we're doing more
enforcement. We may be finding
more violations, and we probably
need to monitor more.
To understand whether again that
compliance is going up or going
down. Would you agree,
yes, Mr. Chairman
Representative, yes, I agree,
and we also in the in the LFC
budget they cut 2% for NMED in
the division house houses the
attorneys who want to hold these
polluters accountable. So I
think we should look at that in
LFC also giving that back and
possibly more so we can't hold
them accountable. OK, Mr. Chair,
thank you for indulging. I'll,
Miss Evans, uh,
This is it's targeted
legislation. I, I, I'll lay out
a few of my sort of core
concerns. One, it's been pointed
out the distance is out of line
with other pure states.
Although sort of no statewide
setback rule, particularly when
it comes to schools, can, I
think, probably fairly be seen
to also be
Um
A challenge uh related to pure
states. So this may be too far
of a distance, Mr. Chair, Miss
Evans, Representative Sareana,
the lack of any sort of
statewide distance.
And can be argued to be a
challenge for sort of social
license uh for production in our
state. And so finding what that
balance might be seems to me a
worthy conversation to consider
to continue, Mr. Chair.
Uh, Miss Evans, Representative
Saana, I've outlined my thoughts
and concerns around the water
quality testing. The
DOD is the prime polluter.
With ethos.
And Mr. Chair, Representative
Sanana, Miss Evans, EAs is in so
many other.
Or at least was recently
commercially available.
Uh, products from ski wax.
To, you know, clothing for
firefighters and other things.
It is simply not accurate in my
opinion.
to ascribe
The evils of PFOS to the oil and
gas industry solely.
and uh it just, it, it doesn't
reflect what we see within our
state.
Where the Department of Defense,
which brings great value to our
state and to our nation.
The same time as the source of
that pollution.
Anything that in the
legislation, if and as it moves
forward that
Seems to sort of run.
Outside of that balance.
That says one industry is
responsible for all the ills and
evils of PFAs.
When it was when
Me again, that's just not the
case.
I will find it hard to support
at other times. Uh, I just
wanted to lay that out. Uh, Mr.
Chair, uh,
representative Yana Evans. I'll
look forward if and as it moves
forward for additional LFC
analysis.
Um, and a particularly around
some of the takings provisions
that Murphy and others have
asked about.
That said, uh, Mr. Chair, I'll
uh be able, I'll be making a
motion for uh moving this
forward with a no
recommendation. I think I
compliment Saagana for her
strong work.
And I think it's a conversation
that we need to continue to
have.
Uh, as we engage in
Of, of
Deeply important time in our
state's history. So thank you
very much, Mr. Chair. Thank you
for presenting Garcia.
Thank you.
chairman and the representative.
Um, Ms. Evans, thank you for the
presentation.
Um
You know, my first experience
with.
I know the oil industry.
Uh, it was back in 1978.
Mr. Chair
I was a Chicano community.
Activists, there in my community
of uh the Arisco Valley.
Uh, unincorporated area of Berne
County.
And uh
What happened, Mr. Chair, was
uh.
Uh, this, uh, oil processing.
plant in Louisiana.
Uh, would fill up their tanker
trucks.
With
Contaminated oil.
That had uh polychlorne
biphenols.
A carcinogen.
It was used back then.
Uh, in the, um.
Um
Industrial and commercial for
industrial commercial
applications.
So, those tankers are loaded up
in Louisiana.
And they were taken to a
processing plant.
In Long Beach, California.
While lo and behold
What bad actors do.
is they find these
Kind of uh predominantly.
Uh, in our state in particular
and a predominantly.
Uh, Hispanic in a New Mexican
communities like my community in
Frisco.
Which is approximately 85%, I
know.
And uh
They dumped that contaminated
oil in this vacant lot.
Um
I don't know how they got into
it, but they dumped the whole
tanker truck, then Mister Chair.
You know, with contaminated oil
that had.
Polychlorinated by phenols,
which is a carcinogen.
And they dumped it
Right in the basin of the
valley.
You know, uh
20 yards away from this lot was
an old Aseca system that
To provide irrigation waters for
Orchards and gardens and.
Alfalfa fields and
Origin, you name it.
And in the vicinity of a
100
Fruit tree orchard.
You know, not even 100 yards
from La Frisco Elementary
School.
You know, uh, not even half a
mile from a local dairy.
You know, and um,
Fortunately
Some neighbors that saw this
going down, Mr. Chair.
The down license plate.
Reported it to them Governor
Tony Anaya.
And he got on it
Like a bed out of hell.
And within a month, that whole
area was cleaned up.
And that contaminated soil was
taken to the proper.
Um
Um
Dumping area.
You know, as
As prescribed by.
By the federal government.
The same, same environment.
Apartment.
Um
There's bad actors in 1978.
And there's bad actors now.
You know, and that's evident,
Mr. Chair, in terms of some of
the noncompliance.
The pollution and the.
In the oil fields.
You know, and uh,
My second, Mr. Chair, my second
experience.
With the oil and gas industry.
was my 4th year as a state rep.
Around 2000
And what happened, Mr. Chair in
2000?
Oil and gas industry was going
under.
So, hundreds if not thousands of
people from the oil patch.
Concerned communities.
Landed here in the capital.
For what reason?
The reform
Oil and gas industry to make it
viable.
And we did.
Those bills passed unanimously.
And those bills were led by
Representative Whittaker.
A Democrat
Otter Lee County
And Representative.
Send out
Democrat.
of San Juan County.
And some of the Chicanos on the
bar, we got a big kick out of
one of the reforms.
It had to do with stripper
worlds.
So
A person like me, born in the
land grant community
bar there. I couldn't imagine
what a stripper was.
I thought it was this dancer
dying on the up on the platform
of a well, you know.
And uh, but that wasn't the
case. There is a specific
Well, that is
Named the stripper well.
Those bills, Mr. Chair, passed
unanimously.
That won't be sending vols.
Why?
The industry was hurting.
And, you know, in essence, New
Mexico was ready.
So this legislature has gone
over and beyond.
In terms of seeing that that
industry remain viable.
and relevant.
You know, and um.
The thing is that we come here
now with this piece of
legislation.
That has been focused on.
Kind of, um,
Inflicting
Like some harm to the oil and
gas industry.
And Mr. Chair, what I see this
legislation trying to do.
is up
This upholding.
The state constitution.
When it comes
To protecting the environment.
The essentials
Of Public health, public
welfare.
And public safety.
That's the essence of this
legislation.
You know, and it's spelled out,
I feel, Mr. Chair.
In a very meticulous process.
But we're not creating new laws,
we're adding to existing statue.
You know, and we're being
conscientious in terms of the
impact on the oil and gas
industry.
By limiting
By limiting the the the pain
field.
to a certain specific
population.
In a certain specific area.
So it's not the whole industry
that's being impacted.
Is this particular
Field.
Oh
Children's environment zone.
For children's zone.
You know, that were really
targeting.
And I see this.
As being is continuing in the
traditions.
You know what this legislature
has been all about.
When it's come to oil and gas
industry.
You know, and
If the bad players don't want to
clean up their act.
And continuing to pollute, it is
up to us as the legislature.
Mr. Chair
Take that action.
You kind of hold them
accountable.
And that's what this piece of
legislation is trying to do.
It's not trying to hamper and
deter, continued development of
the product.
It's trying to inject this
balancing act.
In this particular scenario.
With school children.
So I brought the sponsor, I
bought the experts.
The applaud those people that
came forth.
In the first rerun
And the first run of this
legislation.
You know, I really appreciated
that cowboy that came up.
He gave testimony.
It's good being in one of these
schools in one of these
communities.
His wife working at one of these
schools.
You know, and he has a stake in
this legislation.
I can't see letting them down,
Mister Chair.
You know, it's people like that
that we need to stand up with.
They are feeling the impacts and
implications of what's not going
right in the oil patch.
So I definitely urge my
colleagues to really move this
bill forward.
And let it get a more robust
hearing.
In the next committee.
We have up to-date analysis.
You know, where we kind of begin
to kind of really decipher some
of the statistics that were
tossed out by both.
Opposition and both.
Arties in favor.
You know, I kind of come to
some.
Neutral
On a halfway point.
In terms of really seeing the
uh.
The the the the
The outcome, the positive
outcome that this legislation
has to offer.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative,
Representative Beta.
Thank you, Chair, uh,
Representative.
And Miss Evans.
Thank you for your presentation.
I represent a very large
district with.
Mount Taylor, the sacred
mountain in the center of it.
Represent a district that has 6
counties that has state schools
on tribal land and then.
tribal schools on tribal land
that are federally funded.
One of my first questions is who
will regulate.
Or if you could tell me about
the regulation and development
around tribal schools on federal
land or state schools on tribal
land.
Will this be a part of that?
Uh
Mr. Chair Representative.
Uh we tried to avoid, um,
anything concerning tribal land
or tribal schools, um, because
of tribal sovereignty issues.
Thank you, Chair Representative
Ms. Evans, um.
I'd like to comment that I
encourage participation and
collaboration with tribal
nations on a policy like this
for the safety and well-being of
those, those children because
they are still state citizens as
well.
Uh, my next question is, uh, do
you believe that the variant
section on page 15 ensures a
process for those concerned
about a taking.
Uh
Mr. Chair Representative, yes.
puts in place gives the oil
conservation division, the, the
duty to put in place an
administrative process so that
uh any operator who is
concerned, um, and as we stated
earlier, concerned that this
would have a severe economic
impact on them, um, would be
able to seek a variance or an
exception.
OK, thank you. Um, and then
Just building off of my previous
question before I forget that
one. Thank you, Chair
Representative and Ms. Evans.
Is there an opportunity to start
collecting data through a
partnership with tribes, perhaps
in San Juan County up in these
areas and regions that are being
most impacted to show
The trends and the data for us
to review.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
again, I would defer to uh Mr.
Daniel So, who is uh here in the
audience, but um it's my
understanding that the community
there in the tri chapter area um
around um the counselor chapter
of the Navajo Nation did conduct
a health impact assessment. It
was a community driven uh
assessment, uh, and found, um,
the health impacts from the oil
and gas production.
in their community, and I'm not
sure if the chair would permit
Mr. So to speak, but he is here
and uh
If that is um amenable.
Um
Thank you for that. At this
stage of the proceeding, we've
been on this for 3 hours and we
need to wrap it up.
Thank you chair and
representative and Ms. Evans. I
do appreciate uh the
introduction of Mr. So his
community is a neighboring
community to my district, which
is often referred to as a
checkerboard in eastern Navajo
agency. I appreciate that
comment. Um, I also um grew up
in my community and.
have immense love and passion
for my children and the children
in the neighboring communities,
um, and so I appreciate the
intent of this, and I thank you
for your questions and are
answering my questions, and that
will conclude for me, yeah.
Thank you, chair.
Um, I had, uh, one question in a
couple of brief comments, um.
Given the ability to, uh, drill
laterally.
Um, with these.
Person's be stranded.
Um, Mr. Chair, it's my
understanding that no, they
would not be because their
lateral drilling uh is up to
several miles now underground.
OK, and
Do you have a sense of why.
That's not a primary option.
Like what if
We have clear health impacts
from
Drilling locations.
Why wouldn't that be sort of our
first.
Um, recourse is to simply move
the actual drill sites further
away.
Uh, Mr. Chair, that's exactly
what we would, uh, expect, and
it is, um, exactly what can
happen under this bill, um, and
really the reason why this bill
doesn't impact production.
It just protects children's
health.
OK, thank you for that. um.
So, one thing I've learned in
the legislature is that
Communities aren't uniform.
Um, we heard from members of the
affected communities.
That they support this bill and
that they are concerned about
these impacts.
We have a letter from elected
officials in these communities.
Um, saying that they don't
support the bill and aren't
concerned about the impacts.
And I
I think that's fine. It's a
difference of opinion.
Um, but the communities are not
uniform, so I
When we talk about doing
something against the
community's will.
Um
I think we have to recognize
that.
We may be standing up for people
in that community whose voice
isn't being heard.
Um
I, I believe the health impacts
are real.
I read the materials and the FIR
and other analysis.
Um
I believe the fiscal impacts of
this bill are limited.
Uh, we had a setback bill.
We had setback provisions in the
bill last year.
Um, that were much broader.
And had more significant
physical impacts. And I think
fundamentally,
My view is that we err on the
side of
Public health and kids' health.
Uh, so with that, uh,
Uh, we get a 2nd 1st?
OK, we have a motion in a
second. Go ahead if you'd like
to explain the motion.
Mr. Chair, so, so this is a
proper motion. Are there
questions on the motion, uh, Mr.
Chair, just for the sake, since
we can make this a completely
learning situation for all the
newbies.
Um, I would like to move a um
I'd like to move a motion to
table.
So the substitute substitute
motion the table.
OK, so substitute motion table
takes precedence. Um,
We, we will vote on the, the
tabling motion.
Uh, voted yes, tables the bill.
Uh, if no, uh, if the nose, um,
Or in the majority we be back on
representative smalls.
Um, so can you take the vote on
the tabling motion.
Representative Abeda, no.
Representative Dixon, pass.
Representative Garcia? No.
Representative Grola? No.
Representative Henry, yes.
Here in Montoya.
Yes to table.
Version of Murphy? Yes.
Representative Santa Cortez?
Yes, Representative Small.
Vice Chairana.
Representative Dixon,
No.
Jerry McQueen.
No.
So I believe that's voted 7 to
4, the tabling motion fails.
We're back on.
Uh, represent a small, uh,
Do not pass on the committee sub
and no recommendation on the
bill on.
Do not pass on the bill.
No recommendation on the
committee sub.
Are there any other clarifying
questions on that motion.
Everyone clear what it does.
OK.
And you take the role on that
motion.
Representative Beta, yes.
Representative Dixon.
Pass.
Just, just
Representative Garcia.
Representola, yes.
Representative Henry? No.
Rivers represented Montoya.
No.
Representative Murphy? No.
Representative Senator Cortez?
No.
Representative small.
Vice Chairana.
Representative Dixon.
Yes.
Jerry McQueen.
Yes.
So I voted 74, you have a um
You not pass on the bill and do
you pass with no recommendation
on the committee said. Uh, we
have another bill, please, uh,
last the remains to stay in
place. If you were here for the
first bill and would like to
leave, I would ask that you
leave quickly and quietly
without having conversations, so
we can get set up for the 2nd
bill.
Please turn the mics off on the
table.
Sorry.
OK, are you ready on
how so 128.
OK, our 2nd bill today is House
Bill 12, by the way, for the
committee, we are excused from
the floor. Uh, house 128, uh.
NMFA local solar Access Fund.
Um
Uh, you're being passed out, uh,
materials on the bill. It
appears to be a PowerPoint
presentation, um.
We're not going through this
whole presentation. So if you
could uh briefly uh uh explain
the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and members
of the committee.
I am here to present House Bill
128, which creates the local
solar access fund and the New
Mexico Finance Authority.
At the New Mexico Finance
Authority and makes a $60
million non-reverting annual
appropriation.
To it through the energy,
minerals and natural resources
department.
By providing grants to eligible
entities to construct, plan,
design, purchase, install, or
connect local solar energy
systems used to power buildings
and infrastructure located in
New Mexico. I have with me two
expert witnesses who will be
assisting this morning, and I'd
like for them to briefly
introduce themselves.
My name is Alicia Shaw, and I am
the campaign director for Public
Power New Mexico.
My name is Randy Sadwick
president of Positive Energy and
uh
Uh, industry board member.
Mr. Charo, that's it. We're
ready for questions.
Representative Robo Caballerend,
is that correct?
That is correct, uh, it's a
very.
Mr. Chair, committee members,
that is correct. It's a very
technical amendment based on
feedback we received, uh, to
improve the rulemaking section
and clarify it and to remove uh
the contingency section based on
feedback we received from NMFA.
Can you read the two?
230 number on the amendment.
One moment, Mister Chair, thank
you.
Mr. Chair, the 2, it is
230292.1.
Thank you for that, um, could
someone um
Move the amendment for
discussion. I move the
amendment, Mr. Chair, for
discussion purposes. Is
is there any, is there any
debate on the amendment itself.
Yeah, the amendment looks
technical to me.
Um
And we have a motion to adopt
the amendment to adopt the
amendment.
Is there any objection to the
motion to adopt the amendment.
OK, so seeing then, you have an
amended bill.
Um, now we're gonna go to the
public comment, um, we are way
past our time, um, so we're
gonna do
But, well, let me see a show of
hands. Who's here in support of
the bill?
OK, is there any in opposition?
Does that hand in opposition
over there?
OK. Um, OK, let's do 3 people in
support, um,
If you want to, you don't have
to.
OK, stand up, you have 2
minutes. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman, members of the
committee. My name is JD
Bullington, and I wanted to
speak because I have 3 clients
that are supporting this bill,
the Gallup McKinley County
School District, it would be
beneficial for school buildings.
Also, the city of Santa Fe, the
city council specifically
addressed this legislation in
their recent legislative
resolution.
And uh also.
The Pablo of Laguna is also
supporting this legislation
because it's helpful to tribal
buildings. Thank you.
Hi, uh, Glenn Weel, 3rd Avenue,
New Mexico. We enthusiastically
support this bill as it allows
communities with uh minimal
financial resources to
participate in the solar
revolution. Thank you.
Good morning, um, Mr. Chairman,
members of the committee. My
name is Jim Desjardin. I'm the
executive director of the
renewable Energy Industries
Association of New Mexico. This
bill creates a state fund to
help finance solar on public
buildings, land and tribal
governments to help them to
participate in the transition to
100% renewable energy. It also
helped to provide jobs and
economic development. We
strongly urge you to uh I do
pass on this bill. Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman
McQueen and members of the
committee. My name is Jane Yee,
and I'm here today on behalf of
the environmental justice
Caucus, uh, of the Democratic
Party, we strongly support
distributed generation, that is
important not just to the
climate crisis, but also the
climate equity. We have
supported community solar for a
number of years now that
has been uh somewhat uh impeded
uh by uh in my view, uh, by the,
um, uh, the IOUs, the investment
owned utilities and we believe
uh that this uh local fund and
that the local governments can
fill in that gap and build up
the distributed generation to
that point where uh our
communities and our beautiful
state will benefit. Thank you.
Thank you. Is there anyone
online in opposition to this
bill?
Raise your hand if you're in
opposition.
OK, raise your hand if you're in
support and would like to speak.
OK, we will take one person
online, Stefie Weisberg.
Good morning, Chairman Queen and
representatives. I'm Stey
Weisberg speaking on behalf of
350 New Mexico representing
about 7000 members. We happily
support HB 128. Speaking as a
resident in a rural community
that is subject to power
outages, vulnerable to wildlife,
wildfires and restricted exit
routes. I welcome this bill that
increases our ability to access
energy independence in the event
of an emergency, especially.
Thank you.
OK, thank you for that and
interest of time, we're not
gonna take further public
comment.
Um, any, anything to add before
we go to the committee?
No, Mr. Chair, you're ready.
Thank you. Great. Uh, members of
the committee.
Representative Dickson.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um,
why, uh.
Sorry, the, the fund is going to
NMFA. Is that correct?
Mr. Chair and Representative,
that's correct.
Mr. Chair, Representative, why
is it going to NMFA as opposed
to Mnerd?
Mr. Chair, uh,
Miss Shaw, yes, Mister Chair
Representative Ener is accepting
the funding
and um fund the fund at NMFA. It
is, it would go to Mnerd. It
would flow through Enard because
Enemaate cannot directly uh uh
receive appropriations from the
general fund.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Representative, who is making
the determination on the grant
award.
Mr.
Chair Representative, um,
there's a detailed rulemaking
section in terms of the um
Where Ener and NMFA will work
together on defining the
parameters for um the, the grant
program and their evaluations,
um, and then Mnerd will consult
with NMFA on the technical parts
of evaluating the, the, the
Applications, but NMFA would
administer the fund.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um
Mr. Chair, uh,
Representative, um.
Are you anticipating an
amendment, um, to, um,
Address the PRC's.
Um
Concern about prioritizing.
Systems that include energy
storage.
Um, Mr. Chair Representative.
We will certainly consider that
and discuss that um with, with
all of the stakeholders and
sponsors, so that is possible.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. um, thank
you. I certainly think that
that's a a good suggestion, um,
and, um.
You know,
I hope that you consider that,
uh, I have no other questions.
Thank you.
Thank you, Representative anyone
else?
in Montoya,
uh, thank you, Mr. Chair, uh,
Representative, does this
Is there funding for this
currently in House Bill 2 or
would this have to be added to a
house to.
Mr.
Chan, I understand that
that's in the process. We're
working on uh.
Placing this
Request into H.
The the bill
but currently it's not in House
Bill 2.
From my understanding, it is not
currently.
That that is part of the process
that we're undertaking at this
time. Thank you.
Mr. Chair
Um, Mr. Chair and, and uh
representative I to follow up
on.
Representative Dixon's question.
Um, at 2.
Concerned about the rulemaking
that it's requires NFA to
Have the rulemaking for this
fund.
But I, I do believe, uh,
MNRD would be Mner would be
actually the
Better
Sued in part.
There's still several things
that need to take place.
Um, from the standpoint of any
construction that takes place,
anything, if we're gonna do
something, um.
I do believe
Certain requirements from Ener.
I
There, it only says established
rules and consultation.
It appears to me that
that.
From my standpoint, that's not
strong enough language. I do
believe that Mner would be the
appropriate rulemaking body, so
that's just a suggestion. I'm
not going to belabor the point.
Um
Thank you, Mr. Chair. That is,
that is all I have.
Thank you Matoya represent
Murphy.
Thank you, Mr. Chair
Representative, um, just a few
quick questions.
Um
Mr. Chair Representative, why
use appropriation as opposed to.
Thank you, Mr. Dear. I have to
remind everybody that I have
difficulty hearing and clarity
sometimes I think Representative
Murphy, you can uh be reminded
of this, sometimes I have to ask
for further clarity, so.
If you would mind just speaking
more clearly. I will attempt to
do that is a little gravelly
from the stuff that's floating,
Mr. Chairman representative, and
so let me try this.
I, I did get it, it was
clarified expert witness, thank
you, no need to reply.
Uh, so it's inappropriation
because it is the appropriate
way to proceed with creating the
solar a access fund, which is
what we're doing.
Um, and that's
The answer that I have because
there's no need for there to be
any additional taxes.
Uh, because of the fact that we
have the ability right now
within our general funds and
within our funding and
appropriation process to proceed
in this manner. Thank you, Mr.
Chair and Representative.
Mr. Chair, uh, Representative,
what I'm referring to and what I
refer to the tax code, it would
contemplate that people would
get a tax credit for
under certain circumstances, and
that's uh my understanding, Mr.
Chair and Representative, that
is another methodology of
funding these types of programs.
And so my question is,
Um, wouldn't this, uh, work
better, uh, Mr. Chair, uh,
Representative, if there was a
tax credit, uh, available and
not, um, then rely on recurring
revenues.
Thank you.
Mr. Chair and Representative,
the intent of the grants that we
will be um that are associated
with this fund.
Uh
are for the use of
As identified.
um, local tribes, Pueblos,
nations, land grants, school
districts, public entities where
tax credits, Mister Chair, more
appropriate or when the private
sector is involved and there's
loans, um, associate it so that
it provides an incentive at an
incentives to invest and so for
the nature of this particular
bill, uh, it's more appropriate
to go the route that we are,
thank you, Mr. Chair
we'll wrap up here pretty
quickly. Thank you and we could
go.
with that because I disagree
with that a little bit, but I
appreciate your perspective, um.
Mr. Chair Representative, are
there any other programs that
are targeted to this because I
think it is an important need in
in some situations and I guess
my, my impression is, Mr. Chair
Representative, that we are
approaching these solar and
energy issues rather piecemeal
and not in a strategic way.
And so
Could you speak to that?
Mr. Chair
Mr. Chair Representative, I, I
will just say that this policy
came out of extended extensive
stakeholder engagement starting
2 years ago, um, with, with
folks from tribal governments,
county governments,
municipalities, school
districts. Uh, we also followed
up and called every single one
of those in the state and then
more recently land grants as
we've expanded, uh, the bill to
include them and what we found
is that
You know, a lot of our rural
communities, um, have trouble
accessing the kinds of funding
and that's out there right now
that there's a gap, that there
are communities in our state
that have resilience needs,
public safety needs as well as
um goals to save money in their
budget, things like that, and,
and are very interested in the
benefits of these kinds of
projects in the long term, but
don't really have the capacity.
So
This, this policy is really
intended to respond to the fact
that there is a gap and, and it
has been tailored by our
consultation with these
stakeholders as well as the
impacted agencies.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, uh,
Representative, um, are you at
all concerned with the
environmental impacts associated
with mining for materials
manufacturing installation
operations end of life disposal
for recycling, uh, or recycling
of solar energy system
components.
Mr. Chair and Representative,
that's always a concern of ours,
always, and so.
As we proceed forward with any
development in renewable energy
world, one of the most important
impacts would be to ensure.
That these concerns are
mitigated to the highest degree
possible.
Thank you, Mr. Chair
Representative, one last one.
Um
Are you aware of the LFCs um
concern regarding future program
funding while relying on
uncertain oil and gas revenues.
Chairmanshaw. Mister Chair
representative, yes, I read the
FIR. What I will say is that uh
the funds can accept other
sources of funding, so it is not
limited to future appropriations
it could receive other types of
grant funding, and it is our
intention, uh, for as grassroots
advocates to ensure that this
fund leverages other sources of
funding, uh, beyond general
appropriations and Mr. Chair,
we'll add that um as part I'm
I'm a member of the.
New Mexico Finance Authority
oversight committee, and one of
the things that we strongly
encourage Mister Chair and
Representative, is that we use
these grants to leverage.
Uh, to give the empowerment of
our local communities,
especially our rural
communities, to be able to
leverage additional funds to
keep the projects in further
development, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll
conclude Representative Henry.
Thank you, Mr. Chair
Representatives. Thank you so
much. Um, I'm gonna have the
same kind of questions I had on
a prior bill with Energy
storage. But one of my questions
is, Mr. Chair, you're targeting
rural areas, low income, trying
to bridge that gap, and I, I
fully understand that. One of my
questions is, is what is the
typical cost to get something
like this installed into, let's
say a school or or something
along those lines.
Mr. Chair, I'd like our expert
to answer.
Thank you.
We've installed um
systems across the state we've
installed in all but 2.
Cooperatives on the uh
On the south west side.
And the uh system for a
Fire department is typically
about $100,000 and generates
Uh, depending on the rate
structure, anywhere from 6 to
$10,000 of annual savings.
Thank you, Mr. Chair
Representative. So on a school
compared to a firehouse, I'm
assuming that's gonna be a much
bigger expense, and I guess what
my question is going to lead to,
so I'll just go ahead and ask it
now, maybe you can answer both.
When the system comes to end of
life, what is it going to take
if, if, if this is now gone, if
this fund is now gone, how do
those rural schools, those rural
counties, uh, make sure that
they're able to continue on to
afford this.
End of life type deal. Do they
need new solar panels? Are they
gonna need new battery storage.
What's the incur incurred cost
later.
Mr. Chair, representative of the
committee.
The cost of solar.
Systems has come down about 80%
in the last 10.
Years
It should be
as the uh volume and the scale
goes up, the cost goes down, so
the future cost of replacing the
system.
Uh, we would expect it to be
lower.
And
The warranties on the system are
25 years, but they're typically
last longer, uh.
Then their stated warranties, so
we do not, um,
End of life could be.
30 or 40 years and uh with lower
costs in the future that should
make it um.
More affordable just based on
the savings that they generate
from the uh the uh utility
bills.
Thank you, Mr. Chair
Representative. That's very
helpful because yeah, I, I, I'd
like to, I'm glad to understand
that 25 year mark. Now, within
that, what about the battery
storage? Is that the same time
of life span?
is that the more expensive piece
to this. Just ask.
Mr. Chair Representatives
committee, uh, it depends, and
the technology is improving so
that instead of adding
additional batteries, we can add
a smart.
that allows you to prioritize
the loads and reduce the size of
the battery, but generally
speaking batteries would be
roughly 50 to $100,000 on a
$100,000 solar system.
And then the life of a batteries
are the warranty on the
batteries are typically 10
years.
We buy uh insurance through a
third party that extends the
battery.
Warranty up to 20 years.
For up to 50% of the capacity.
Thank you, Mr. Chair
Representatives and panel.
The last question I, I'll kind
of have is.
To, to go along with
Representative Murphy's question
because it's the same one I had
on battery storage when, when
that bill came through. When it
does come to end of life, we're
seeing in California they're
trying to understand what to do
with their panels as they are
kind of coming to.
I know, I know it was mentioned
earlier that that it is the
utmost concern.
But what are we doing to make
sure that as the batteries come
to end of life with the lithium
and the solar panels and the
dangers to that environment, how
are we being able to get rid of
them, uh, safely and make sure
not to have a big environmental
impact.
Mr. Chair Representatives of the
committee, we've been in
business for over 25 years now,
and we have uh.
We have to pay to recycle the
modules. It doesn't cost
anything to throw them away.
Um,
and the batteries, uh.
Are more organized.
Uh, because of the um the
content of the, of the
chemistry.
There are a recycling locations
now and
And some of the manufacturers
are offering recycling services
in some are not.
So it's um
The the battery technology is
about.
4 or 5 years in the stream, so
it's not.
At a point where we're going to
start seeing end of life.
For maybe another 5, 10 years.
Mr. Chair and Representative, if
I may, as the production
increases, there's becoming more
and more as the expert, uh,
testified were advancing in
technology and as we advance in
renewable technology, it becomes
more and more incumbent upon our
production and access and
opportunity to ensure that we
place those processes in place
so that we can guarantee that
everything is.
Safe to our environment and is
recycled in a proper and safe
manner. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman
Representatives.
Thank you, Representative
Representative Senator Cortez.
Mr. Chair Representative, you'll
be glad to know I have a very
simple question. Um, has this
been conducted in other states?
Mr. Chair, Representative, one
of the sources of inspiration
that drove our outreach and
exploration around this policy
was a large solar incentives
bill that was passed in
Minnesota a few years ago, and
so there are other types of
programs and funding and and
incentives like this in other
places. Excuse me.
Mr. Chair Representative, what
were the results?
Or was it not quite the same.
Uh, Mr. Chair Representative,
that particular example was
passed 2 years ago, so I think
it might be too early to say, I
will say that one of the reasons
I gave you all this large
handout is to kind of give you a
picture of what some of these
projects look like, and from,
uh, there's a whole section on
what people do with resilience
centers which exist across the
country, but then from pages,
uh, 20 to 34.
There are some examples of these
kinds of projects in New Mexico,
um, to kind of give you a
picture of the different sizes
and impacts and benefits um of
them, if that would help. Thank
you so much, Mr. Chair
Representative. I know that
statisticians usually stay 2
years behind in data collection,
and so is that surfaces for that
state, I would just be
interested to see the data, um,
that includes my questions,
thank you so much, Mr. Chair.
I have one question. Anyone else
on the committee?
OK, um,
Well, I guess I just have a
comment, um.
To uh representative Murphy's
point.
Um, we're funding public
entities. Is that correct?
So when, so public entities
since they don't pay taxes,
can't use tax credits. OK. And
speaking of public entities,
thank you for adding the land
grant community. Uh, I
appreciate that. Uh, our land
grant communities are political
subdivisions of the state, and I
feel like they're too often
overlooked. So I, I think this
is something they could actually
take advantage of it. Uh, and so
I really appreciate you
including this.
Uh, what's the pleasure of the
committee?
I moved, uh, Mr. Chair, I moved,
uh, to pass on House Bill.
We have a motion to pass and a
second from Representative
Serana.
Um, can you take the vote on the
DuP pass?
Representative Abeda.
Sorry, you pass as amended.
Thank you.
Representative Abeda.
Yes.
Representative Dixon.
Representative Garcia.
Representative Grola? Yes.
of Henry? No.
Representative Montoya.
Representative Murphy.
No.
Representative Senator Cortez?
No.
Representative small.
Vice Chairana.
Chair McQueen.
by a vote of 74, you have a do
pass motion as amended.
Thank you,
everyone.
