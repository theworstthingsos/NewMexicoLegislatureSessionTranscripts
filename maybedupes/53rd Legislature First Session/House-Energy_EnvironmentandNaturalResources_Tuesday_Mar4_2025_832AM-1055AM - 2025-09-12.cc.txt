Representative Montoya.
Representative Murphy here.
Representative Seta Cortez,
here.
Represent a small.
Viana.
Chair McQueen.
Here.
We have corn.
OK.
Um, so we have, uh,
4 bills on the agenda today, um.
Uh, we will do the last two
bills if we have time.
But they're on the agenda?
Uh, I talked to the ranking
member about that.
Uh, we are going to change the
order of the 1st 2.
Uh, which I usually don't do,
but um,
First State Forester found
herself on the wrong end of a
mountain bike.
And she's got some appointments
to attend to today. So we're
going to get her out of here as
quickly as we can.
Any questions, comments,
announcements from the committee
before we begin?
OK, so first up we have sent
Bill 33 wildfire Prepared Act.
With um
represent
Good morning, Mr. Chair, members
of the committee.
Uh, we're bringing a very
straightforward bill to you this
morning, which is Senate Bill
33.
And um
A lot of what this bill does is
uh property insurance increasing
is getting increasingly
difficult for New Mexico uh
homeowners to obtain high risk
areas due to industry risk
mapping and mapping and
catastrophic fires both
nationally and locally.
Structure to structure spread of
wildfire resulted in nearly 3000
structures burned in 2022.
And 2024.
With um
You know, with fire carried
through embers, flames, and
radiant heat.
Trees and shrubs adjacent to
structures.
And on property between homes
contribute to fire spread unless
there is defensible space.
What does Bill?
Really accomplices, Mister
Chair, members of the committee
is um there's a task force
that's gonna be developed.
And uh they're going to develop
standards for divincible space.
And the 5 ft zone closest to
structures.
Develop wildfire prepared
standards for certification
consistent with national
standards set by the Insurance
Institute for Business and Home
Safety, the IBHS from now on is
what how I'll refer to it.
Or other
Comparable organizations.
Develop guidelines and require
for requirements for
eligibility.
For two kinds of grants.
The bill authorizes two types of
grants to be awarded.
From home hardening efforts.
Grants to political subdivisions
to modify structures.
to be wildfire prepared, conduct
hazardous fuel reduction to
provide a buffer.
Two structures and.
Conduct assessments and certify
structures.
Our wildfire prepared and
Grants
to qualify entities to assist
eligibility.
Um
For property owners with making
the necessary changes to the
structure and properties to make
them wildfire prepared.
Mr. Chair and members of the
committee.
A lot of the reason that I'm
bringing a lot of these bills
forward this year is in Riosa
we've had a lot of devastating
fires as well as more around the
state.
And what is happening is we're
watching insurance companies
move out.
Not completely move out, but
they're not willing to take the
risk anymore and now people's
insurance.
And I'll just give you one
example, one of my friends lives
in a pretty good area there on
um in Ridoso and his
Property insurance was $2200 a
year. Now it's almost 7000,
that's how much it's going up if
you can get it right now we're
not currently writing policy in
Lincoln County, and that means.
If you have a mortgage.
And you can't provide insurance.
You no longer have a mortgage.
So people can be foreclosed on
and we have to meet.
We have to meet these, we have
to quit burning people's houses
down we have to get ahead of
this and, and.
Hopefully with this along with
some other legislation, we're
going to start pushing against
the Forest Service a little bit,
start doing their job.
And thinning the forest we have
to pull some fuels away from
these houses or we will continue
to do the same thing, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee, I do
have my expert witness here,
Laura McCarthy. I'm gonna give
her a nickname because I don't
even know she should be here,
but uh, she did have a, a, a
bike accident and she's been
with me the whole time and she
said I might not be with you
physically, but I am there with
you mentally so I'd like to
introduce her and let her say a
few words. Thank you.
Mr. Chair and members of the
committee.
For McCarthy, could you pull the
mic towards you, yeah, there you
go.
This bill concept was worked on
for over a year.
Collaboratively between 4
agencies, so the energy,
minerals and natural resources
department.
Forestry division, the state
fire marshal, the construction
industries division and the
superintendent of insurance and
we partnered closely with the
insurance institute for Business
and Home safety to really
understand what it is that
insurance companies are looking
for, uh, in terms of home
hardening and
The um unique characteristic of
that organization IBHS is that
they do a lot of research after
wildfires to see which homes
have survived, and there are a
set of characteristics that
really improve the survival of
homes and this bill is designed
to assist local governments to
provide technical assistance to
their communities and to
neighborhood organizing, so
that it's not random acts of
retrofitting, but rather getting
whole neighborhoods into uh a
condition where they can
actually survive a wildfire and
providing grants um as needed to
those who cannot afford to make
the improvements themselves so
that they don't pose a risk to
their neighbors, um, with that,
uh, Mr. Chair and
Representative, I think we are
ready for questions or whatever.
you do next.
OK.
Anything else that represent
Vincent?
Uh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee know that we're ready
for questions.
OK, by a show of hands, who's
here in support of this bill.
OK, who's here in opposition?
And OK, so we'll, we'll take 3.
Uh,
members alliance who would like
to speak in support, please step
forward.
So just step up. There you go.
You'll have 2 minutes.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of
the committee, um, the sponsor
and expert witness for this
really great bill. We heard at a
Sierra Club event from Porfirio
Chevarria about some of the
things you don't think about in
home hardening like removing
your doormat or your cushions
from your porch, uh, furniture
to avoid fires, and this is a
great investment thinking
community mindedly. I just did
want to point
out that counties throughout
eastern New Mexico specifically
have had some of the highest
insurance premium increases
nationally, and that counties in
southern New Mexico face the
nation's highest risk of what's
called paying a climate premium
shock.
So we are absorbing the costs of
this crisis. We have to do it,
but we also have to think about
climate policy. Thank you.
My name is uh Guy Deonte, um,
I'm a member of the Fire Safety
Committee for our HOA. It's 175
acres out by Las Campanos.
And I've tried to get a fire
risk assessment for RHRA for 4
months and have not been able to
do so. And I was told to submit
a request for assistance from
the uh Santa Fe Peaky soil and
water conservation district.
But
We haven't heard back from them.
I did submit the uh the
application, and then I was told
that it was run by a non-paid
volunteer.
So it seems that we're just not
prepared for this kind of thing.
So I, I really urge you to, uh,
pass this bill. Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman,
members of the committee, Carrie
Robin Bruder, I'm representing
Lincoln County. Uh, this bill is
a really big priority for us. We
think that the experience that
we had last summer with the
fires and then going through our
community really taught us and
our other mountainous
communities that hardening homes
and having assistance from the
state to do so is a critical
component in any kind of
firewise activities that are
happening. We think this makes
sense, not only for our county,
but for our sister counties. So
we really urge passage of the
legislation.
OK, thank you for that. That's
gonna end our in the room, uh
comment uh we you go online, uh,
we'll take 2 online if you'd
like to speak in support.
Uh, first up with Michael
Newman.
Good after.
Good morning.
Good morning. Can you hear me?
Yes.
OK, my name is Michael Newman.
I'm the general counsel of the
Institute for Business and Home
Safety
reference before. We're building
safety institute funded by the
property insurance industry and
our focus is identifying and
mitigation actions that can make
homes and commercial structures
survivable and insurable. In the
wildfire context, we're very
focused on conflagration. That's
that uncontrollable building to
building fire spread. We see an
increasing frequency in recent
years.
We've been able to identify the
mitigation actions to reduce the
risks that homes will ignite and
neighborhoods will burn, and
these mitigation actions are
achievable and affordable, but
they're not free, which is why
Senate Bill 33, which creates a
grant program, is so important
for helping homeowners to take
the necessary mitigation actions
they need to to reduce their
risk.
Around the country, we've seen
home hardening grant programs
and a variety of different
hazard contexts, providing
critical public resources to
help homes become more
survivable and insurable. I
really liked uh what Laura
McCarthy said that we, we, we
don't want random acts of
retrofitting, random acts of
kindness, great, random acts of
retrofitting less helpful in the
wildfire context and Senate Bill
33 will help groups of neighbors
take those necessary actions so
that they can reduce their risk
for themselves.
And for their whole community.
Uh, IBHS is ready to support New
Mexico in bringing down its
wildfire risk and we hope that
uh Senate Bill 33 will pass, so
we have an opportunity to work
with uh state forester and other
state leaders as you work
together to make homes and
communities throughout the
state. Again, more survivable
wildfire and more insurable.
Thank you very much.
Uh, next up we have Sherrick
Rohorst.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and
members of the committee, Sher
Groost with the PNM
PNM
uh support of SB 33. We think
the sponsor for bringing this
conversation forward, and it's
important. It's an important
bill for our state. Thank you.
OK, now I'm gonna ask you, is
there anyone online who would
like to speak in opposition.
Please raise your hand. OK, not
seeing any, so.
Um, back to the sponsor before
we go to the committee. Anything
you'd like to add for take
questions?
Mr. Chair, we are ready for
questions.
Members of the committee.
and Murphy.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
Representative and uh
I hope you recover from your,
your tumble. I've, I've been
there, so I know I know how you
feel. Um, one of the things I
really like about this bill is,
is that, um, it seems to me
that, that we can apply some
lessons learned.
And uh Representative Harlan, um
excuse me, Vincent, if um if you
could, um, address two areas for
me real quickly. One is lessons
learned.
And had this, uh, and, and not
only in Lincoln County but near
Las Vegas and other parts of the
state there's others lessons
learned, I assume. And also how
this might have impacted.
The reaction to the recent fire
in Lincoln County. If this had
been in place, uh,
For
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you Representative Murphy,
so lessons learned, we don't
learn our lesson very well.
I don't know why that is and uh.
Mr. Chair and Representative
Murphy.
We've known for a long time that
we're overgrown.
In Lincoln County as well as
everywherewhere else and if
anyone goes through Otero County
and goes up into the cloudcroft
area.
It's really overgrown in there.
And either we get ahead of this
and we learn our lesson.
Or we don't get ahead of it, and
it takes that forest out.
And the devastation that we went
through I know more I haven't
actually got to go to Las Vegas,
but in Lincoln County, not only
does it burn the forest, it
changes the the topography.
So there's no more.
Hiking out in there because
there's 6 ft fingers where the
where the water channeled and
it's not safe to walk through
there, so there was an
assessment done and they say
there's almost 13 tons.
Of material that comes off of
those burns per acre.
So add 13 tons per acre, however
big the fire is, and that's how,
that's how much is coming down
and filling up our our
reservoirs, our rivers, and we
have to haul all that debris off
and that's some of the stuff
that took out the racetrack.
And in
I think the lesson that we
really learned because this was
the one that we had been
studying for over 25 years.
And it finally happened.
The lesson learned is.
Look how many people were
devastated now they can't get
insurance now they can't come
back home and either we get
smarter and we start putting
legislation like this forward
and we get ahead of this
problem.
Or
We wait for the next one and.
Throw a billion dollars at it
and
People still get hurt
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Chairman Representative, I
have one last question. Um, kind
of two parts to it.
Um, the first part is the
difficulty in obtaining
insurance.
And you talked about Lincoln
County, but I know for a fact
that Santa Fe County has a very
similar problem and probably a
lot of the forested areas and
this may be a question for your
expert. Um, so, if you could
take on that one, about how wide
of an impact this has and the
and the problems with with
getting insurance and affordable
insurance. And the second one,
and, and I'm doing this because
I know the chair wants to move
things along is um.
I will this just address the
wildfire side of the equation or
is also addressed for the, the
inevitable flood that's gonna
occur after that one.
Alright. Thank you.
Mr. Chair and Representative
Murphy.
This, I think the fire that
happened in Las Vegas as well as
the one that happened in
Lincoln County
Has changed things a little bit.
And I've seen the insurance.
Industry come to the table.
I've seen the
Superintendent of insurance,
come to the table.
We have state forestry.
At the table
And
We also have some legislation
that we're running.
For the fair plan.
And we have got to help our New
Mexicans.
Be able to get insurance.
I'm gonna share one story with
you that I got last Friday.
And it's a friend of mine and he
lives in Lincoln County. He's in
his 70s.
And the he was a contractor, the
only thing that he has is his
vehicles.
In his house
He cannot get his house insured.
He lives on Social Security.
And his house is all he has as
far as his retirement plan goes.
And he said every time I leave
my house, I have an uneasy
feeling when I get back it's not
gonna be there.
We have got to figure out a way
to get people some insurance,
the only way that we can get
them insurance is we have to be
proactive and we have to come to
the table with state forestry,
US Forest Service insurance
agencies and we have to make
this area more appealing to
where they're not taking all the
risk.
And right now they look at it,
they don't want any of the risk.
And that's why they're not
writing any policies.
Did that answer your question?
It did. Thank you, Mr. Chairman
Representative. I think that
concludes my questions. Thank
you very much.
Thank
you. Thank you, Mr. Chair, Mr.
Chair, Representative, uh,
Forrester, this bill is focused
on property and, and sort of
homes.
The properties uh that those
homes are on and communities are
in and sort of that wild land
interface. Is that right?
Mr. Chair and Representative
Small, yes, so Mr. Chair, um,
I want to brief, so that's good.
There's funding in the budget
for this.
Uh, Mr. Chair, State Forester
representative. So this is
focused less on the forest
itself more on the properties,
sort of the uh the homes
themselves, which is great,
making those um more fire
resistant, better for their
neighbors, better for those
property owners.
Um
And then sort of that adjacent,
right? You know, going from that
property boundary, say to where
that other, where the road is or
maybe where the forest boundary
is or where the tribal boundary
is.
So I, that's I've got that
clear.
Mr. Chair and Representative,
um, yes, and just a couple of
other things to add to that.
So currently there is no state
agency that has the jurisdiction
to um assist with the home
hardening itself. It's not in
the state fire marshal
responsibilities. It's not in
the forestry division
responsibilities or OSI or CID
and um currently the forestry
division can assist you uh with
all the trees on your property
right up next to the house, but
we can't help you.
you, for example, if there's a
tree growing in the middle of
your deck.
As well, this bill also um does
include the ability to put
buffers on private lands
adjacent to say National Forest,
where the national forest is not
in a position to put in a a safe
buffer zone, and it is connected
in that way to another bill,
House Bill 175 that is
exclusively about buffers. Got
it. OK. Uh.
Mr. Chair, Representative
Forster, that's how.
Helps me, I'm excited to support
it.
I'm excited also for us to
continue our conversation on
sort of forest and watershed
health.
Um, simply going back to the
pre, you know, going back to a
previous time where the Forest
Service put out every fire.
Logged every acre and other
things helped get us to this
point. It's not the only thing,
but it helped get us to this
point. We've got a, uh, do more
thinning, more timber
harvesting, a lot smarter
management.
Uh, that is also much more
watershed focused, so I just.
Always want to make that point,
Mr. Chair, that we can't
suppress our suppress fires as a
way out of this.
Nor just completely log
everything as a way out.
But I, this is a bill that is
smart, targeted, funded, and
excited to support. Thank you,
chair.
Thank you it is a small version.
Thank you, chair. Thank you,
Representative Vincent expert,
thank you for being here. Can
you just, I, I looked at your
committee members and I looked
at the implementation. Can you
give me an example of how this
would work, um, obviously, fires
don't respect jurisdiction and
boundaries. How do you see this
working in Lincoln County with
the Mescalero tribe. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Mr. Chair and
Representative Abeta.
We have a wonderful relationship
with Mescalero. There's mutual
aid agreements with everyone and
when we do have fires,
everybody, you know, gets along
and and uh all the stakeholders
are at the table and they're
making good decisions.
Mescalero.
Is one of our, I'm very proud of
Mescalero.
Because
I had a good friend that logged
in Mescalero for almost 30
years.
And they did a very aggressive
logging operation there and this
is back in the good old days
whenever they had a a sawmill
and everything and they were
really.
of the standard
If you wanted to see how to
manage a forest, go to
Mescalero.
And that's where I met Thora
Padilla, the president. She is a
forester person.
She understands it, and that's
why I'm so glad right now that
she is the president over there
because her and I, we fit
together like a hand in a glove.
And she is backing this 100%.
And we want to make sure that we
are starting these logging
operations, um, like
representative Small just said.
We need to turn this into a
driver, Mister Chair.
We need to show people that
there's jobs that we can bring
to the table and this this
timber.
It has a monetary value.
It, it's not as attractive after
it burns, it's way more
attractive.
You know when it's still
standing.
We're running some other
legislation on uh timber grading
so that we can create our own
timber.
And instead of all that good
timber going to chicken coops
and panels and things like that,
it can go to rebuild.
Lincoln County and, and you know
hopefully we stand up sawmills
all over the place to where we
can do the same.
So that's how that's working.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Thank you
representative. I'm glad to hear
that there is partnership and
collaboration with this bill.
They'll build off your existing
partnerships. Thank you.
Thank
you, Cortez.
Thank you so much, Mr. Chair
Representative and expert. I do
have a couple of clarifying
questions. So this bill would
create new standards for
buildings in high risk areas,
right?
Mr. Chair, Representative Santa
Cortez, yes, you got that right
this time. Thank you so much,
Mr. Chair Representative and
expert. And so with this bill
require existing structures to
be remodeled to also comply.
Mr. Chair and Representative
Senator Cortez, we don't require
anything they put in for a grant
and then we have the task force
go out, they evaluate it, they
evaluate the the risk area.
And you might not even be, you
might not even qualify.
Mr. Chair represented an expert.
Is there an estimate of the
number of properties in the high
risk areas?
Uh, Mr. Chair and
Representative the.
Senate Committee substitute, so
now the bill before you added
mapping as a responsibility of
the task force, we currently do
have high risk areas mapped, but
it's somewhat primitive compared
to the technology that's
available at this point in time,
so, um, that will be if Senate
Bill 33 passes one of the very
first things the task force will
do is decide.
On mapping methodology and get
that work done so that um
whatever amount of money is
appropriated for Senate Bill 33
implementation. It won't be
enough to do everything
everywhere and we'll need to set
priorities based on data.
Thank you so much, Mr. Chair,
Representative and expert. So
what are the stipulations to
qualify, Mr. Chair and
Representative, that is not
specified in the statute that
will be up to the task force to
develop the um the very specific
guidelines for eligibility for
financial assistance.
Not so anybody can do home
hardening. It's a matter of
whether you're eligible for a
grant and the statute will
define what is an eligible
property owner.
Being a New Mexico resident.
Excellent. Thank you so much,
Mr. Chair Representative and
expert. I'm excited to support
this bill. You have my full
support.
Thank you, Representative
Representative Garcia.
Thank you, uh
The chairman, uh.
Reps under and madam expert
though.
I just have one question.
And it uh deals with the
The FIR in terms of the analysis
that the Attorney General
raised.
Regarding possibly adding an
anti-donation clause exemption
in the legislation.
Audit the substitute take care
of that remedy? Or how did it
remedy that concern.
Mr. Chair Representative Garcia,
I'd like to invite, uh,
Are legal up here and let him
give you that legal explanation,
so generally we don't pull
people out of the audience as
experts, um, he probably
should've been up there from the
get-go, but
Let's hear the answer.
Another lesson learned, Mister
Chair.
Mr. Chairman, Representative
Garcia, um, with regards to the
anti-donation clause, there are
a couple of cases that we rely
on to try to figure out what is
and is not fancy donation
violation.
Um, we do not have a perfect
test in case law. So we do not
have a case that says exactly it
is not an anti-donation
violation if you are conducting
a firearm, hardening or wildfire
activities on private land. What
we do know is that courts in New
Mexico have said that private
gain is incidental or
consequential to if the private
gain to the landowners
incidental or incidental or
consequential, there's no
anti-donation violation. We also
have case law that says that
gain to a private entity is
incidental if the project is in
initiated for a public purpose.
So, again, those are fact
patterns that are not exactly
perfect for this, but in this
case, the benefit is a
contemplated to apply at a
neighborhood level, the
activities uh in these projects
happen on private land, but the
benefit is effectively equal
across the entire neighborhood.
So with thin case law, what we
rely on is the language that
we've got.
Um, and it is Ebner's legal
opinion that the existing case
law, uh, and, and the language
that we've got in there supports
moving forward with wildfire
treatment activities. This
analysis was developed actually
both for this bill and the
buffers bill, so the, the, the
question sort of was tackled
with both bills in mind.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Rosanna.
Thank you, Representative
Garcia. I have a few questions.
Anyone else on the committee
before I go, Representative
Grilla?
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you for, for always working on
on trying to protect our
communities from situations like
this,
um, I, I just one question, how
this bill is going to help with
um health problems because
people who live in these areas
are also held um.
the right to share like I don't
know any filters, any mask
anything, how, how can this be
approached to?
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Representative Garrola.
So it's, it's real simple if we
go in and we start taking a lot
of the fuel.
Out of areas.
It's not going to burn as
intense.
So that that.
That in essence gives our
firefighters enough time and
space to be able to get into an
area and put fires out.
But whenever you have 40 mile an
hour winds.
And you have overgrown, I call
it dog thicket. It looks like
dog hair. It's so thick in
there.
Where they're supposed to be
somewhere in the neighborhood of
50 trees per acre and we're
running at 1000 to 1100 trees
per acre.
And when, when you add fuel.
And wind and heat.
That's what's going to make fire
and it's gonna, it's gonna run
through and it's gonna do
whatever it wants to do and
there's really not a whole lot
you can do to stop it.
When the wind is blowing so.
Bad. A lot of times we can't
even get aircraft in the air.
So the fire will literally we
call, I call it a ribbon fire.
It's just gonna, it's gonna make
a run.
And you try to stay on the
flanks of it and keep it pulled
in, but it's gonna make a run
and you can't even get ahead of
it.
Taking more fuel out of it.
Takes less heat out of it.
And it's a, it's a little bit
easier to manage.
Mr. Chair
Thank you, thank you for the
answer, um, yeah, I think it's.
It will prevent it and it will
be really good to see how can we
support in that area. And just
uh one comment, Mr. Chair, um,
the insurance is going up every
area. I know in these areas are
going.
Extremely high, but I think the
Albuquerque area, I have some of
my constituents mentioning that
insurance have been going up, so
it would be interesting to see
what's going on there too. Thank
you, thank you, Mr. Chair, I
didn't get the last part of your
question. How's it gonna help
people's health we're we're
gonna keep all the smoke pulled
out of the air, that's what's
gonna help people
share and uh representative. I
was trying to see afterwards if
we could put something like a
filters, mask, provide something
to provide when the situation is
going up. It's.
I, I understand your prevention.
But I was asking, uh, mentioning
a comment also during that
situation if there is anything
that we can help also for, for
the breeding part, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Carolla. Anyone else?
OK. Um,
Couple questions. Uh, first off,
Um
Represent Vincent, um.
In Foresterre McCarthy. So you
have this task force.
And it includes
Uh, the fire marshal, um,
Mission of public lands.
Uh, includes some federal
officials. Typically when we see
um committees and task force and
things like that. There's or
their designee.
Language.
Because you might not get, you
know, the commissioner of public
lands or some of these federal
officials attending the meetings
is is there a reason that
language is not in here?
Mr. Chair
Uh, so
Senator who was just in the room
a few minutes ago, um.
Uh
When this bill was in.
Senate Finance, there was a long
discussion around representation
of um, elected officials and um
appointed.
Agency heads and decision makers
versus representatives of and I
was in the committee substitute
that a representative of was
struck throughout
that um section of this bill.
If I may, Mister Chair.
What the what the impetus was on
that was they wanted decision
makers at the table and
designees might not be decision
makers.
They wanted the, the absolute
decision makers on this task
force, Mr. Chair.
OK. And that's great if they
show up.
But it's not so good if they
don't show up.
And we obviously have no control
over federal officials.
Um, and I know a lot of these,
you know, a lot of these people
are
Running large agencies, so.
I think that's um
I think that's odd, um.
And probably unfortunate, so.
Uh, I'd like, uh, I understand
there's money in the budget for
this. How much money is there?
Mr. Chair, there is 20 million
in the budget for this project.
OK, and so on page 8.
Uh, line 8 of the bill of the
substitute.
Talks about qualified entities.
Uh, what's a qualified entity?
Mr. Chair, a qualified entity in
this context would be somebody
who was um procured through an
RFP process to provide services.
And it is also defined on page
2.
Line 2
So that could be um
Like a contractor, a builder, a
landscaper.
Mr. Chair, yes, and I overlooked
the words could also be a
political subdivision.
OK, so then if you look a little
further down on PG, um,
Qualified entities, the money
goes to the qualified entities.
For the purposes of assisting
eligible property owners.
Ribs and Garcia asked about this
a little, I'd like to dig a
little deeper.
Who is an eligible property
owner?
Mr. Chair, the way I, uh,
envision this working is.
Um
That the
first set of grants that will be
offered will be.
The first, the primary kind,
which is to the local
governments to do the
neighborhood organizing and that
the uh the way I envision this
rolling out is that when.
A neighborhood is ready at.
80% of the homeowners being
willing to take the next steps.
Then those within that community
who cannot afford to do the home
hardening themselves can become
eligible for financial
assistance.
But the financial assistance
would be contingent on that
neighborhood scale of action.
This is um based on an emerging
body of work that is coming out
of the Institute for Business
and Home Safety.
They currently run the wildfire
prepared homes program and they
are beta testing a neighborhood
prepared.
Program and.
Um
It would be our intention
through the task force to adopt
the neighborhood program, uh,
along with IBHS to roll this out
and to
Uh, establish those eligibility
criteria.
So, so my concern here is, is
the anti-tonation clause.
And I've had some conversations
with Mr. Shelton, uh, in
relation to the hospital in 75.
Um
There is no public purpose test
in the anti-donation clause.
Uh, if there was, it would
swallow the entire claws.
Um, there's no balancing test in
the anti-donation clause.
Again, that would swallow the
entire claws.
Um, I am concerned that we're
I, I fully agree that this is
important work, and this needs
to be done.
Um
But I'm concerned that in our
Or the pressure we feel to get
this work done.
We're just
But not blinders and pretending
the anti donation clause isn't
there.
But it is.
And unless you're, unless you
fit into one of the exceptions
to the anti-donation clause. I
don't see how you
give grants to private
individuals. I don't see how you
spend state money.
On private property.
Ross Vincent, Mr. Chair, I
appreciate that and I, I know
the way you feel about this
because that's the same way I
felt about the opportunity
scholarship.
And it's to public benefit is
the best way that I can look at
that and you know, my wife
worked for a foundation and her
sole job was to.
Raise money for kids to go to
school.
And then we come up with an
opportunity scholarship.
That directly gives money to
people.
And
I don't know if it was a
loophole.
Um, you know, the, any time you
add the human factor in anything
we're always looking for a
loophole to something to make
things better.
And I think that.
Whenever I look at this wildfire
prepared act.
I look at it as the opportunity
scholarship you're just giving
people an opportunity for public
benefit.
To harden their homes to where
we can, we can save a lot of
these subdivisions.
From burning down.
And um I don't know if you got
the chance to to go to.
Las Vegas or Lincoln County, but
you know.
When you look at it pre and
post, it is the most devastating
thing you've ever seen happen to
your hometown.
And whenever we were talking
about Mescalero, Mr. Chair a
while ago.
That fire was backing right down
towards the end of the mountain
gods.
And if you've ever seen their
lake there.
You know, whenever that burns
down and it starts burning
around the lake, then it fills
it up with silt and so that's
the best way.
And, and you and I have had that
conversation that's the best way
I can explain this.
Is when you think about this, I
guess it just have to make your
heart warm and think opportunity
scholarship and you know the
older I get, the more I want
doctors around, so, um.
That's the best way I can
explain it, Mr. Chair.
OK, um, courses McCarthy, if you
need to leave, that's fine. I
probably have questions for Mr.
Shelton anyway.
Um
So Vincent.
I
You know, here we are in the
house energy environment and
Natural Resources Committee.
Uh, we're not house education
committee, we're not health
health human services or
anything like that.
Um
I
I don't know how the opportunity
scholarship works.
Uh, if the opportunities
scholarship violates the
anti-Donation clause.
Hopefully it doesn't.
But that's not a reason to
violate it in other places. It
doesn't.
Like it's not like, well, we've
reached it, now we don't have to
pay attention.
Um, hopefully they, you know,
there's a rationale that
supports that expenditure under
the opportunities scholarship.
I'm still looking for the
rationale that it supports the
expenditure of funds under this
bill.
Or under 175.
Um
I, I don't have the exception to
the anti-donation clause in
front of me, um, there's one for
Um, dealing with indigent, um.
You know, you know, could, could
you fit an exception.
Could you fit this, um,
Expenditure under that kind of
exception for someone who could
not afford this.
Um
You know, if that's the
exception you're aiming for,
like,
I think that should be
referenced in the bill. It, you
know, for some McCarthy.
Has a vision for how this is
going to play out.
But that vision is in Forester
McCarthy's head, it's not on the
pages of this bill.
Mr. Chairman, I think if it, if
it helps, there is an exception
in the internation clause that
allows the state to expand state
funds and resources for the
purposes of providing essential
services primarily for
residential purposes.
Now, generally speaking, this
essential services construed in
the language of the, of the
constitution is things that are
more utility focused internet
energy, water, waste water, etc.
if you think of safety as an
essential service that the
government is responsible for
providing and there is actually
language that goes that you
could read specifically to that
exception and that is on page 8,
you referenced it earlier, at
least 50% of the grant money
awarded shall go to residential
purposes.
So the essential services
exception was passed like 2
years ago.
Um, and I'm already starting to
regret it.
Uh, because it keeps coming up
and saying, well, this must be
an essential service. It's come
up in this committee before.
The, the sales pitch on the
essential services.
Uh, exception, which I
supported.
was basically the Navajo Nation.
That they didn't have electric
and water lines, I mean.
Like it's, it's shocking when
you think about it.
That we haven't electrified and
provided water service and sewer
service in the Navajo Nation.
Still today. I mean, it just
goes on and on and on.
And, you know, because of that
need,
You know, we passed this
exception, and it's a, it's
probably a a good example of the
The idea that that facts make
bad law, right? So we
We knew that was a problem. We
knew it needed to be addressed.
And so we, we adopted this
exception to address that
problem.
Without really thinking about
how it might be used and
Essential services might cover
it.
That certainly wasn't the
intention when we passed it.
Um
You know, I think the bill
should say that as part of the
rulemaking, as part of the
process for developing this
program.
You'll evaluate those things.
To make sure that it's covered.
And instead, all we have is
eligible property owners. With
the word eligible, all of that.
You know, statutory law,
constitutional law, case law.
I squeezed into the word
eligible.
And the hope that it'll be
implemented in such a way that
that's taken into consideration.
And
I struggle with that.
So that, that's my issue with
the bill.
Um
I think
You know, I,
I've been working on
Um
Land conservation, land
restoration, watershed
preservation.
Uh, worship thinning.
Uh, for
Oh
25 years.
Um, I fully see the need for
increasing the, improving the
health of our force.
Uh, our forest are severely
overgrown because we took fire
out of the out of the regime.
And like, you know, if you're
looking at 50 trees an acre,
that doesn't happen if you just
let everything grow for 100
years.
And now we have a problem.
Um
So I, I, I
Resent Vincent, I appreciate
everything you're doing for your
community. I really do.
Um, I'm gonna vote against this
bill.
Because I think it's flawed.
Um, but I also expected to move
forward and
Um, maybe I'll come up with some
language to amend it later.
Um
What's the pleasure of the
committee?
I'd like to make a motion for a
due pass, Mr. Chair.
I'll second.
We have a motion, a 2nd.
Uh, was Representative Guilla
out there?
OK.
So let's see if we can find
representrua.
OK. I don't think it's gonna be
a problem, um, uh, Nina, you
take the vote.
Representative Obeda, yes.
Representative Dixon, yes.
Representative Garcia.
Representative Grorola,
Represented Henry, yes.
Represented Montoya? No, and I'd
like to explain my vote.
Representative Murphy? Yes.
Representative Senator Cortez?
Yes.
Representative small
Yes
First year.
McQueen.
No.
A vote of 72, you have to pass
represent Montoya to explain his
vote.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chair and
Representative Vincent. I too
completely uh understanding
everything that you're doing for
your community, and I appreciate
it and saw what happened last
year and uh very much sympathize
and agree with the effort.
Um, I too, uh, have
Problems with the
constitutionality.
Um
What we seem to be beginning to
do is continually breaching uh
the anti-donation clause. It's
one of the areas where I think
Chairman and I
I
One of the very few areas where
the chairman and I have almost
complete agreement on is that,
and I, and I see as we go down
the road, the more we do this,
The more that clause will mean
nothing, and the more we do
this,
Uh, there's absolutely no way
once we start to be able to give
money directly.
To the populace that will ever
be able to
Stay ahead of what are just a.
Massive increases to our budget
every year. Now, once again,
understand your effort. I, I,
you don't have many choices, so
I, I appreciate this, so, but
If it goes, if, if it continues
down the road like this, I'll
I'll probably have to vote
against on the floor as well
just, just because I just
Have uh a belief that I cannot
vote for anything that I see is
unconstitutional.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Representative
Vincent.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
committee.
It takes care of you guys.
Mr. Chairman, are you're ready,
please?
Thank you share um share members
of the committee Senate Bill 23.
Uh, raises the maximum royalty
rate.
On the best of the best tracks
held by the state land Office.
Uh, to make them basically raise
it to a fair market price.
Um
We are the house energy.
Committee, we've heard other
energy bills, um.
This session, we've heard bills
that impose costs and fees and
rules and regulations on the oil
and gas industry.
Um, this, this bill is
different.
This bill is not a tax.
Not a fee
Not a regulation. It's not any
of those things.
It's selling something the state
of New Mexico owns.
For a fair market price.
And when I say the same of New
Mexico owns it, that.
So it glosses over an important
nuance. The state of Mexico owns
these at holds these assets.
In trust
For the beneficiaries of the
land permanent fund.
Which are schools or
universities and hospitals.
Um
The commissioner of Public lands
has a fiduciary duty, a legal
obligation.
To maximize the return from
these assets.
Um, that legal obligations stems
from the Enabling Act.
Uh
We cannot
Prevent her from doing that.
And that's essentially what has
happened in recent years.
Because we have capped.
Our royalty rate and
artificially low rate.
Um
This bill has passed the House
before uh this this particular
bill as uh the Sent bills come
over from the Senate.
Uh, I can remember debating this
bill on the House floor uh last
year.
Um, and
The question was raised, uh, why
cap it at all?
And I think the answer should
be.
That we shouldn't
We should, it should just be
what the market will bear.
But in keeping with past
practice, um, we just picked a
rate 25%, which is uh consistent
with other states, notably
Texas, uh, who we share the
Permian Basin with.
This feels a little different
than last year's bill in that
it's geographically limited.
It only applies uh basically in
the Permian.
Not the rest of the state.
And we think that's OK.
Because that's, you know, the
only place where these tracks
exist.
Uh, it was never suggested that
we were going to increase the
rate across the board and in
fact, that's not what this does.
It just increases
The maximum
And lower rates can still be
charged in other areas and for
other types of wealth.
Um
Yeah, a couple of other things.
One, does not affect existing
leases?
Only affects future leases.
Uh, so in that it's fairly
limited because most of the
state land.
is are released.
Um, I work on this before, uh,
someone shared a
Um, lease with me.
that the rate was.
Um, my, I've been 1215,
something like that.
The lease was over 100 years
old, was signed in the twenties,
1922, I think it was.
It was for multiple sections of
land.
not small parcels.
And at least these leases are
held by production, at least.
You know, had been making quite
a lot of money for a very long
time.
None of that changes.
This is only future leases.
Um, two other changes that were
made in this particular draft,
one is uh the bill specifies the
reasons the Satland office can
cancel a lease, that on page one
of the committee substitute and
that's basically for um
non-production.
Or default
And then on the very last page
of the bill, there's another new
provision that is that the um
state land office will publish
the the evaluate each track and
they they provide a ranking and
they're going to publish the
basis of that ranking, uh, just
in the interest of transparency.
Um, so that's what this bill is,
uh, I'm joined today by Sunla
Stewart, Deputy Commissioner of
operations at the state Land
Office, and I'd like to turn
over to him and see if he has
anything to add.
Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee Stewart, Deputy
Commissioner of Operations at
the Land Office. Um, I'm gonna
be really brief, but I just
wanted to hit on a couple of
points. I
The last time that we updated
the royalty rates in New Mexico
was in 1970s. Disco was heavy at
the time. It's been a very, very
long time, uh, uh, Texas has
this rate since the 1990s, um,
so, you know, the state land
office, as was stated.
Our mission is to generate money
for the school kids. Uh, we are
more like an enterprise, uh,
well, we are an enterprise
agency. We're more like a
business, and the fact that we
are capped and unable to charge
a market rate, ultimately really
uh impacts um.
Our ability to, to fund public
services in New Mexico.
Um, last thing I would say is we
have been blessed. Uh, Lee and
Eddie County in particular, uh.
Some of the best rock in the
world.
We have amazing oil and gas
resources, and what a royalty
is.
It's a share. These are public
resources when you sell the
public resources, we're making a
deal, and under this bill we're
saying in the best of the best
areas.
Companies for the benefit of uh
Companies for the benefit of
getting the, the oil and gas to
market, they get 75% of the
value.
And the public gets 25%. So even
for moving from 20 to 20, from
20 to 25% in the uh
In the best areas.
is still
A huge upside for these
companies. Um, so with that, uh,
we're happy to answer any
questions. Thank you. Thank you,
Deputy Commissioner. Um, we're
gonna first go, uh, in the room
if there's any in opposition,
please raise your hand.
Great. Well, please line up.
We'll go ahead and take 3 folks.
Uh, in person to online, trying
to keep with the church
practice.
Good morning, Mr. Chair and
committee members. I'm Larry
Sontag here on behalf of the New
Mexico Business Coalition. We
appreciate uh the sponsor's
comments about wanting to be
have a New Mexico uh.
Market rates, uh, we support
that from a business
perspective, but this bill is
not taken into account the other
taxes and fees and the
regulatory environment in New
Mexico that is different and
higher than Texas, so we would
encourage you to not look at
this in a vacuum. This would
have a detrimental effect to our
oil and gas industry, which they
already, as you know, provide a
great deal of benefit to the
state.
And uh we don't want to do
anything to disincentivize that.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Good morning. My name is Paul
Guessing of the Rio Grande
Foundation, a state-based free
market think tank based in
Albuquerque.
I echo Mr. Sontag's views on the
fact that New Mexico is actually
taking more than any other state
from the oil and gas industry in
terms of revenue, and I'd also
Note specifically the gross
receipts tax, which impacts uh
New Mexico's price of oil
extraction overall, but more
importantly,
New Mexico's sitting on $61
billion in funds managed through
the state Investment council.
This session and previous
sessions, we've seen proposals
to reduce the taxes of the state
and
Return some of those dollars to
New Mexicans, but instead,
government continues to grow and
sit on more and more money, and
we continue to be one of the
most impoverished states with
the education system that is not
getting the job done. So if you
want this money, I encourage you
to share the wealth with New
Mexicans, not just hoarded in
government. Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, um, Jim Winchester
with the Independent Petroleum
Association of New Mexico. I
know this may come as a
surprise, but we do stand
opposed, um, for 6 years, the
state land office has been
pushing for this 25% royalty
increase on what they call the
best of the best, which is
without dispute, the New Mexico
side of the Delaware Basin in
the Permian.
Now, if this bill were to go
through, then truly the best of
the best tracks need to be
accurately defined to inside the
geological boundary of the New
Mexico-Delaware Basin and that
that 25%, but this bill does not
do that in this bill, the map of
eligible tracks bulges out way
beyond the Delaware Basin to
include all of Eddy and Lee
County tracks where the rock
there is not the best of the
best in the world.
Now this leads to no bids on
non-premium tracks set at
premium prices. And this is not
a hypothetical, it's already
happened. It's killed
multi-million dollar projects
that independents were ready to
invest in over the course of the
last 2 years.
In the state and beneficiary
revenue on an unbid lease is $0.
Now we've attempted to fix this
with the bill's primary sponsor
and to keep the best of the best
just to the New Mexico,
Delaware, but the state land
office refuses to do that.
We literally don't think that
decision makes dollars and
cents. So for that reason, we
stand in a post.
Thank you. OK, now we're gonna
look online, uh, please raise
your hand if you're in an
opposition online, we'll take
the first two.
OK, there's nobody online. Nina.
OK, great. Uh, please raise your
hand if you're in support here
in the room.
OK. Uh, we're gonna go ahead and
take 3, obviously note that
they're far more than 3 folks
who have raised their hands.
Go ahead and line up, please.
All right. Thank you, Mr. Chair,
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, I'm Camila Feibelman
with the Sierra Club's Rio
Grande chapter, though I'll
recognize a bunch of other
organizations looking out for
the state's natural resources
and support of the bill in the
room, leasing rates in New
Mexico State lands haven't been
increased since the 70s, they
increased to 25 to 30% royalty
rates on new leases in high
producing lots is on par with
Texas and Colorado Oil and.
ga s extracted from state lands
belongs to the people of New
Mexico. These are publicly held
resources extracted off public
lands for private profit, and
New Mexicans in the land office
beneficiaries should be fairly
compensated for this resource.
Some will claim that industry
will leave New Mexico if they
have to pay a fair royalty rate,
but the only factors that
indicate where extraction will
occur is around the quality of
the oil, the ease of access to
it, and the price on the global
market. Thank you.
you.
Thank you.
Good morning, Chair and
committee members. I'm Osa
Chavez from NM Native Vote. We
really need to allow the state
land office to increase the
royalty rate to 25% for
extractions on the highest
producing lands. These resources
often come from state lands that
hold our tribal culturals and
traditions. These resources
belong to all of us, and we
deserve a fair price. Many
tribal members and communities
are beneficiaries of the state
land permanent fund, Natural
resources extracted off our
public lands for private profit
are expressly for the profit of
our children and communities.
This resource, owned by all New
Mexicans, benefits our hospitals
and schools, industry should pay
the market rate for these
resources. This rate hasn't
changed since I was born.
The, this has been our home for
thousands of years, oil and gas
have profited at the expense of
frontline communities. Now is
the time to increase those
royalty rates, please vote.
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Chair, members
of the committee. My name is
Jordan Kessler. I'm with EOG
Resources, which is the largest
operator in the Permian Basin.
Um, we're here today in support
of this bill, we've viewed
historically our relationship
with the state land office as a
partnership. We understand that
the rate in Texas is something
um that we're already paying in
terms of royalty. And so again,
we're here in support of the
bill. Thank you.
Thank you.
OK, uh, we're gonna look online.
There's 2 hands raised, uh, we
have Peter Campos.
And Felicia Guha, uh, Peter, go
ahead, please.
Good morning, Mr. Chair and
committee.
Good morning, Mr. Chair and
member.
My name is Peter Cos. I'm with
County Chamber of Commerce
and we support 23. You have to
go back to the 1970s to see the
last adjustment in rates on
land.
With primary competitor
munication,
we are not to be good to
increase revenue while still
remaining new competitive.
We agree with the land with an
We agree with the land leases
would be more industry-friendly
than those on Texas.
Because in the medical school
offer longer terms
and charges the royal
calculation of the proceedings
that allows for to do that.
The Chamber of Commerce
you.
Great, thank you.
Thank you.
And finally, we're gonna
conclude with Felicia Guilha.
Felicia, please go ahead.
Good morning, members of the
community. My name is Luaen and
I'm here on behalf of strong
supporter of Senate Bill 23.
New Mexico has long been as a
resource colony and for too long
the oil and gas extraction, into
corporate instead of benefiting
the people whose land is being
drilled,
raising the top and necessary
and that
to ensure that our public land
for the public good.
This bill will generate billions
of dollars for our public
schools, hospitals.
And universities ensuring that
future generations have access
to the resources they need to
thrive. We urge you to pass 23
and ensure the wealth extracted
from our land is reinvested into
our people, our communities, and
into the transition that we must
undertake to build sustainable
future. Thank you.
Thank you. Hey, that's gonna
conclude our public comment. Mr.
Chair, we'll go back to you
briefly and then go to the
committee for questions.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chair. Just
wanted to follow up on a couple
of the comments. Uh, first of
all, um, Mr. Winchester
suggested that we wouldn't be
able to lease tracks at a lower
rate and that's not true, um, if
a track was put up for auction
and there were no takers, the
land office could simply put it
up for auction again at a lower
rate, uh, that's part of how
auctions work.
Um
As the comment that we really
should be giving money back to
the people. That's what this
bill does.
So if, if we are charging oil
and gas companies at below
market rate, the beneficiary of
that is the oil and gas company.
not the people.
If we're charging them a market
rate, the beneficiaries is the
people, is this money goes into
the land grant permanent fund
and the land grant permanent
fund.
Basically pays for education in
New Mexico.
It's estimated that the land
because of the land grant
permanent fund, the average
family saves $3000 a year in
taxes.
That's what this does. This fund
that fund or the life of this
bill, it will add an additional
$1 billion to the land grant
permanent fund.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
very much. Hey, we're gonna go
to the committee for questions.
Murphy.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, Mr.
Chairman and Deputy
commissioner.
Um
I want to talk about a number of
areas. Um, the first being
And I had not planned to talk
about this, but it was brought
up in the testimony and it's the
statutory lease form.
And I'm not gonna spend a lot of
time on it because, um, uh, but
I think it needs to just clarify
some information.
Um, has, has been my practice
and when we try to lay out where
I'm going and I'm gonna get
there so that uh you all can can
think about um your answers.
Um, the first area after the
statutory release form I want to
talk about are the economic
factors, the private industry
considers, and I want to talk
about taxes, regulatory briefly,
and then I really want to go
into the, the royalty
discussion.
The second part of it is how
royalties impact exploration and
production, because there is
some diversity as to whether
what sort of impact this might
have, and I think we need to
talk about that and explore a
little bit.
The 3rd area I want to go into
is basically the clarifications,
the canceling of leases, um, and
the, uh,
The, uh, I'll just call it the
transparency on calculations on
the, on the rating.
Um, and then I really want to
talk about the best of the best
and where that is and what that
means from my experience in the
industry and what I think
industry experiences.
is saying. So, uh, and then I'll
conclude. And so, um, Mr.
Chairman, if I could proceed in
that manner, um.
Mr. Chairman and Deputy
commissioner, there is a long
history of why this legislature
has wanted to have a statutory
lease for them and at least from
my understanding, I'm not an
attorney.
Practicing oil and gas operator,
um, and so part of that, I, from
my understanding and Mr.
Chairman and Mr. Chairman Deputy
Commissioner, however you wish
to answer this. It all comes
down to the subject that we've
had, we've been talking about a
lot in this chamber and that's
legislative control.
How much are we going to give to
the executive branch? How much
are we gonna give to land
commissioner and so forth. So my
understanding of the statutory
lease form was basically the
legislature saying to the state
land office, Fine, go manage
these assets on behalf of the
people of New Mexico, but we got
to have some guardrails because
we don't want political wins
wins I guess to to shift this
back and forth and Mr. Chairman,
Mr. Chairman and Deputy
Commissioner, would you say
that's a fair characterization?
Um, Mr. uh, Chair Representative
Murphy, you know, I wasn't
around when the.
Uh, at least was put in the
statute, um, I, I find it as an
attorney who drafts leases, I
find it perplexing that there's
a lease in statute.
Um, the forms I work on, uh,
constantly evolve and get
better.
Um, every time I do a deal, I
learned something new and I go
back to my base forms and I make
tweaks and adjustments and
improvements. The fact that
we've locked this lease into a
statute and basically haven't
changed it much over the years
is really surprising to me, but
you are correct. It's in the
statute.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. We, uh,
Mr. Chair and and deputy
commissioner and we can probably
have a long debate about whether
the we there's wisdom in that or
not but I just wanted to set the
groundworks that this is a
statutory lease for me. It is
set by the legislature largely
influenced by this body right
here and there's probably some
good legislative reasons for
that. I mean, do you uh totally,
you totally disagree with that,
Mr. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman.
Um, Mr. Chair, Rosa Murphy, I'm
not sure. I totally disagree,
but I certainly disagree to some
extent.
What
Once again, we found ourselves
at least Mr. Chair, Mr. Chair,
at least partial agreement.
That's, that's a wonderful
thing. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna
move into the economic factors.
And there's really two
categories of economic factors.
I think that go into an oil and
gas calculation and I'm going to
oversimplify these, but
hopefully we can agree that the
reason.
The first are those that are
sort of controlled or seen by
the private sector, the
individual company. The second
are the ones that are are
controlled and overseen largely
by
government this body and in the
bigger body.
And so on the private sector
side of investment decision has
to take into the price outlook.
And that's always uncertain.
But, um, at least that's a
consideration.
The second is the cost to drill
and produce.
Um, and the expected royalties
and revenues.
So from the business side, Mr.
Chairman, Mr. Chairman and and
deputy commissioner, uh, would
you agree those are things that
private business would probably.
Mr. Terre and Murphy, yes. OK.
Thank you very much. Um, Mr.
Chair and Mr. Chair, now I want
to go into the economic factors
that are controlled by
government.
And I know I'm gonna have to
take it a little bit of dispute,
uh, with you and that this is
not a fee or a tax because quite
frankly, Mr. Chairman, Mr.
Chairman, all of these things
are ultimately calculated on.
Tax base.
have attacks, you have
royalties, and then you have
regulatory compliance.
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, I
suggest to you that.
Sometimes the first two well
difficult.
but not impossible to sort of
quantify.
Where I'm going with this, um,
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman is,
is competitive, right? We've had
a lot of discussion about how
competitive is New Mexico to
these other states.
And
Mr. Chair and Mr. Chair and
Deputy commissioner, I think
that
You would agree with me that it
is important for New Mexico to
remain competitive against our
competitive states or peers.
Uh, Mr. Murphy, uh, in general,
yes, um, you know, a couple of
things I'd like to add on to
that. First,
I think this bill makes us
competitive. I think it raises
our rate to something that's
competitive with our neighboring
state, Texas, and you even heard
that in public testimony from
EOG Resources, no less.
Um, I, I think, um.
I had a 2nd point I've lost it.
I'll remember as you ask
questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr.
Chairman, I wanna go in now uh
to the taxes, and we've had, and
once again, I'll move through
this quickly because it's not
directly related to this bill
but it impacts this bill.
And um, Mr. Chairman, Mr.
Chairman, um, we had a long
discussion on 543. There it's
been in a couple of committees
over the last several days.
And Representative Perel Young,
um,
Pointed out something that I had
not picked up on, and I thought
it was very interesting. We're,
um, if you go through the, the,
the individual analysis, Mr.
Chairman and Chairman.
You sometimes find different
numbers.
And one of the things, and I
don't remember, I could find it
if, if I'm pressed, but one of
the things that she said, well,
I have one FIR agency analysis
that says that you guys pay
8.2%, 8.25%, I believe.
I have another one that says,
9.1. And I think we walked
through sort of the differences
is that it's sometimes easy to
go through and add up all the
various taxes that Mexico pays.
Conservation tax and so forth
and probably come up with 8.25
number, but there's always
little outliers, property taxes,
some other tax, and so the other
approach, the 9.1 number was
basically saying we're gonna
take the value of the product
and divide it by the all the
taxes that are paid against it,
and that gets us to 9.1.
So there's, there's a
discrepancy of a little less
than 1% there.
But then, Mr. Chairman,
Um
I, uh, I happened to do some
research and someone was
provided to me. There's a 2019
New Mexico Tax Institute study
that says the effective rate on
the Mexico producers are
actually around 21%.
And
So you all have seen me
sometimes successfully, Mr.
Chairman, Mr. Chairman,
sometimes unsuccessfully try to
do math in my head while I'm
sitting in this chair, but it's
a long ways from 9%.
The 20% and so one of the things
that I hope that everybody will,
will take into account is
there's is there's a couple of
major differences between Texas
and New Mexico. One is the, the
gross receipts tax.
The other is the is the
corporate income tax, those two
things together come up with
about 8 to 10%.
Um, so if you tack that on to
the 9% or we had 20% no, but
we're at 17 and we're getting
closer.
My point is only this, I think
all of us.
Uh, certainly in this committee,
certainly the legislature, uh,
at hand, it's time for a new
study and um I would hope that
you might agree with me on that
principle is is that some point
this body really needs to have.
An unbiased look at these tax
and
These overall tax burdens to the
best degree that we can quantify
and Mr. Chairman and Mr.
Chairman, I'd like to hear how
you, how you feel about that
because I'm a little uneasy with
the numbers.
Miss Cheri and Murphy, um,
first, if I may, I remember my
second point, um, my second
point on the competitiveness is.
I, I believe competitiveness may
have an impact at the margin,
like in terms of marginal.
Wells marginal and marginal
operations.
It will not impact these tracks.
This is my 2nd time doing this
bill is never once been
suggested that these premium
tracks won't attract bidders at
the 25% royalty rate.
And so that's, that's what what
this bill is about is
Again, the best of the best.
It will not impact our
competitiveness.
Um
Uh, and I would like to have uh
Mr. Stewart address your
question about the the overall
relative tax burden.
Thank you, Mr. Mr. Chairman
Representative, I, I'd actually
noted that as well that in the
FIR report, there were two
different numbers and we've been
using uh the 8.5 uh effective
tax rate for oil and gas, uh,
taxes compared to Texas, uh, I'm
sorry, Texas is at 8.5 and New
Mexico is at 8.3.
That they were essentially on
par, uh, and there is that 9.1%
report. I asked LFC about it and
they said it had to do with the
fact that, uh, the returns in
the production numbers, uh,
basically had been amended going
back to when that occurred. So
even though the report was using
2017 numbers. It it essentially
had been updated, and that was
at Delta. And I believe they are
going to be working on a report.
Uh, to try to update that, uh,
and I think that will be helpful
for, for everyone. But, but just
really wanted to emphasize, you
know, ultimately, I think what
you're hitting on, uh, and I'm
sure you're much better
businessman than I am, but it's
profit and cost, and yes,
royalty, increased royalty rates
is an additional cost.
But it is not a tax, and, and
when, uh, when you have a
resource that is sold by the
public, um, and you have an
upside, ultimately,
Anybody you ask.
And, and I'm, I'm sure, uh, Mr.
Chair Representative, you would
agree, if we put these tracks up
at 25.
They will be purchased.
And they will be purchased at
that rate because there is a ton
of profit to be made. And so,
um, you know, we're not here to
say that there won't be an
additional cost on business, uh,
but that cost is related to a
sale of an asset. It's not
related to just a burden on
industry overall because you're
increasing tax or fee.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr.
Chairman and Deputy
Commissioner, I'm gonna take
issue with you a little bit
because once again, I don't
think it takes very much more
than elementary school math to
know something, and that is, I'm
just gonna use round numbers.
If I'm producing a barrel of oil
and the price of oil is $100 a
barrel.
And um 10% of that goes to tax.
And 20% of that goes or 25, I'll
just make it 20.
The effective price that I'm I'm
getting for my barrel of crude
is now.
What, $70.
Um, 10 and 10 and 20.
So, from a business perspective,
it is a tax.
Because it takes it right off,
um, right off either the profit
margin, in some cases or in the
case of royalties right off the
top.
So, I think we can quibble over
the over the terminology, but
it's probably better to move on.
I'll just say this is is that.
Is that from a return
standpoint,
Um, I can tell you that I have
seen many calculations, and I
could cite a whole number of uh
of of examples both in my
company and decisions that
public companies have made is a
very small margin, even 5% can
make a huge difference when
you're looking, as you know, uh,
Mr. Chairman Deputy
commissioners looking at cash
flow stream that may stretch out
for 2020 plus years.
So, um, I don't want to belabor
royalty definition versus tax
definition, but I will say this.
To us, it doesn't matter. It's,
it's, it's still, it's whether
you call it a tax or royalty, a
burden, a deduction, or whatever
else in price it either impacts
our net production.
Or it impacts our net price. And
so,
Um, the other issue under
economic factors I wanted to
discuss and I won't
Go into this cause really I want
to get into the bill more but is
the regulatory environment. One
thing that I think we all need
to uh recall is.
Um, and proudly the Mexico um
industry produces the cleanest
oil and gas in the world.
Um, and I think we've really
risen to the regulatory
challenges or, or uh goals that
this administration and others
have set out.
Um, it's just easier once again
based upon my 50 years in this
business and operating on both
sides of the border to do
business in Texas than it is in
New Mexico.
Now there may be folks in this
room that say, well, there's
very good reasons for that and
I'm not here to dispute that,
but that's just, that's just a
fact.
Um, in terms of the royalties,
there's really 3 factors that
impact and I'm gonna go into so.
The numbers some more, the
economic.
Um, I really challenged the FIRs
that that um they say this won't
cost us money and I'll, I'll,
I'll go through that.
Um, and why it's, uh, in my
opinion, it's not a good
investment.
But generally when we when we
see the the the public that
there's first this issue of
severance.
So, let's talk about who really
owns these minerals in the in
the state of uh under state land
office, uh, lands, people of New
Mexico, the beneficiaries of
them.
Under private land, it's my
understanding that the private
owners.
Um, rep on those minerals and
therefore, we're charging a
private owner, a severance tax
for something that the
beneficiaries don't own in my
opinion. Now, now, Mr. Chairman,
Mr. Chairman, and, and probably
to you, Mr. Chairman, is, is,
um, or my legal underpinnings
here, solid or not?
So Mister Cherubs and Murphy.
First of all, I just, you know,
I have to emphasize that.
This bill only applies to state
trust lines.
Where this built doesn't apply
to private lands in any way.
Um, so we're, we're talking
about isn't 7 isn't a severance
tax, we're talking about royalty
rates, selling something we own.
Um, Mr. Stewart do you have
anything to add on the
Comparison between the two.
Mr. Chairman Representative, I
think the only correlation
between severance and royalty is
frankly it's a.
The tax deduction.
Uh, that, uh, you get to take
when you pay royalties, um, but
uh as stated, this bill has
nothing to do with severance
taxes. No, I understand that. I
was just Mr. Chairman, Mr.
Chairman, trying to make the
point that it, it is a
cumulative impact and in some
cases where severance tax is
being applied to private
mineral, that doesn't really fit
into the category of beneficiary
ownership. And the same is true
on federal lands where I guess
technically maybe the
beneficiaries own half of those,
but I'll move into the royalty
issue. There's really, there's
3 things from my experience that
impact.
Um, a decision with respect to
an oil and gas lease.
The first is the term.
Um, the length of time that you
have and um my understanding is
most state land office leases
are currently at 5 years while
most federal leases, if I
recall, are 10, and Mr.
Chairman, Mr. Chairman, am I
remembering that correctly?
Mr. Chair Representative, that's
correct, that the initial
development period for state
trust land for development lease
is 5 years and for the federal
government it's 10, I think
other states have actually
shorter.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, Mr.
Chairman and Deputy
commissioner. So,
Once again, from what I
understand on on the old federal
BLM leases and there may still
be some being leased at this
rate, at this rate, it was 12.5%
royalty.
Current rule is I think 16.67.
And now we're going to have a
variety of rates within the
Mexico State Land Office with
the, the, the, the highest being
25% for the best of the best. So
my understanding that correctly.
Uh, Mr. Jason Murphy, I, I think
that's correct. I think there's
already a variety of rates
within the state land office,
right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
Mr. Chairman, I, the next thing
that and, and I question a
little bit under, I believe it
was the state land office
analysis.
Was that
There were some question.
That
How this would impact bonuses.
Bonus being the upfront payment,
the oil and gas companies make,
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman and
Deputy commissioner, that's
probably your question. I don't
know, but however you want to
take off.
Mr. uh, Chairman.
Murphy working on this bill, you
know, you learn a thing or two,
my understanding is the
expectation is that the bonus
payments would be somewhat
reduced and that the money would
be more than made up over the
term of the lease.
And Mr. Chairman and Mr.
Chairman, I'm not gonna take 3
minutes out of amount of issue
with you on the best of the
best. I think, uh, as I'll get
into it here in a little bit, I
think we just have a little bit
difference of opinion on what is
the best of the best.
Um, so we know that it's almost
like
I hate to say robbing Peter to
pay Paul, but there is a balance
there. There is that if you
expect a higher royalty rate.
You're gonna probably get a
lower bonus, but the calculation
is, is that if that lease is
successful. It's discovery made
that additional bonus is gonna
or additional royalty is going
to more than offset that bonus
and I would think that's, that's
the assumption that the office
is making, chairman, Mr. Chair,
uh, Rosanne Murphy, that's
correct and uh substantially so.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr.
Chairman.
I've got examples and I'm gonna
hit those at the end of the two
canaries in the coal mine.
That we've already seen um.
Um, I think it's a pretty good
indication of where uh this
could go.
And so I'll speak to that more
later.
Next, I want to go into the
second category of how royalties
impact exploration and
production.
Now
If you have a highly, let's call
it the best of the best area,
and you've got
You know, a blanket, oil and gas
play.
Um, and you've got
Which at least you perceived to
be decent oil and gas prices
going out further.
Then
Um, you might very well be able
to make the case that look,
Our side of the of the border
geologically is just as good as
Texas side and therefore we
should, we should, uh, charge a
similar royalty rate to Texas.
One of the problems I have is,
is that is the definition of the
area of the best of the best. I
think it's, it's expanded beyond
that.
And that is going to be areas
where you, in order to attract
exploration and production and
perhaps they're more isolated
places. I don't think those
areas will, will take.
25% royalty and I wanna give you
uh an example very quickly, Mr.
Chairman and Mr. Chairman.
About 18 months ago, we started
drilling a project down in the
Delaware Basin.
And um it's taken me 20 years to
put that project together.
And it's um.
So
Knowing where that area is
versus the more the edges of the
basin.
Um, you're going to find that
that royalty rate.
It is, it's gonna impact that
exploration and the future net
revenues to state land office.
So
I'll get into that in some
detail. The thing is, is that I
really want to point out that
you not only take that geology
into consideration, Mr.
Chairman, Mr. Chairman, Deputy
Commissioner, but you also take
into the fact that it's not the
big guys.
That are out there finding these
fields.
The history of the industry, Mr.
Chairman and Mr. Chairman is, is
that it typically is a small
independent. As a matter of
fact, it was my company that
drilled the first horizontal
well in the state in 1991. I
think I had 8 employees.
2002, we drilled the first
successful one, then later sold
that field, um, to a, uh, to a
larger company who has since
developed it.
So, these
These
These discoveries.
Which many time are developed by
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman,
independent.
Are eventually sold to the
bigger companies because they
basically have the scale.
help them out quickly.
And it's a little bit, Mr.
Chairman and Mr. Chairman, if
you look, think back to history,
it's like when I believe I've
got this correct. Henry Ford.
Built, uh, bought out Etzel,
right? Wasn't that these cars
are necessarily bad, it's just
that they were being produced in
an inefficient manner and Ford
brought forth these
manufacturing techniques and
processes, much like the majors
bring scale to discoveries we
make.
And so, I point out to you, Mr.
Chairman and Mr. Chairman, and
dispute me if you think I'm
wrong.
But a large company has not made
a major onshore discovery.
Since New Mexico's own.
Robert O. Anderson discovered
the Prudhoe Bay field in 1968 in
Alaska.
The most recent activity that we
have seen across this country,
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman has
been the, the great shell place
started by independent George
Mitchell in Texas and then
expanded all across this
country, including into the
Delaware Basin of New Mexico.
So, um, as we go through this, I
think we need to keep in mind,
Mr. Chairman and Mr. Chairman,
that
Um, different royalties and
taxes can affect different
places differently and I would
just ask is, um,
Do you believe that? Have you
seen that in your experience,
Mr. Chairman?
Mr. Chairman Reent Murphy, I
think you're
Uh, asking a detailed question
about the history of gas
development in the United States
and you have much more
experience with that than do I,
um, I, I, I appreciate your
wealth of knowledge.
Um, I think.
You know, we're talking about is
an oil and gas resource that has
been identified that is well
known and premium tracks within
that area, so um I appreciate
that spirit of exploration and
that risk taking, uh, and, and
this is where some of those
benefits come out from those
efforts.
And I probably didn't tell you,
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chair, my
question very well. I guess it
was really
Um
Is it your experience that it's,
it's the smaller independent
producers that typically find
the new, the new fields and
that.
That, um, when, when keeping in
mind an incentive programs or
tax programs or increased
royalty programs.
Those programs could impact the
margins of an area more than the
gut, the, the center of the
area, the best of the best. Is
that a reasonable assumption?
Mr. Chasson Murphy, I don't have
personal knowledge to dispute
that convention.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think
that's almost we, we just agree
a little bit and that's, that's
OK too. Um, canceling leases,
um.
My guest, Mr. Chair, Chairman
Deputy commissioner there, this
is probably more in your
wheelhouse.
And that is, um, there is a
there there's a reinstatement or
there's a restatement, I guess
in the bill of what the what the
law, what the rules say about
canceling leases. I'm just
wondering.
Uh, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman
and Deputy commissioner, has
there been an uptick in recent
years in canceling.
Mr. Chairman Representative,
thanks for the opportunity to
talk to that provision. Um, so
the least the statutory lease as
is, says that we can only cancel
a lease for cause, um, uh, if
they break the terms of the
agreement, um.
There were concerns raised, um,
uh, not based on facts, but uh
concerns raised that the land
commissioner was, uh, canceling
leases for no reason, so we
could lease at a higher rate.
Um, that is 100% just false, uh,
but the sponsor of the bill, uh,
said he wanted to make it very
clear that we only can cancel
for cause, so he took the
provision in the statutory lease
and a repeated it a second time
up front, so it's duplicative,
but he really wanted to
emphasize that in terms of your
question, um.
We have been absolutely 100% uh
dedicated towards ensuring
proper enforcement of our lease
terms. That has been a priority
of the commissioner. When you
spill, you clean up. If you
don't pay us, you might lose
your lease unless you submit a
payment. Uh, if you don't have a
bond, you gotta get one.
But the numbers speak for
themselves. We did a review of
6000 active leases.
We found about 800 that lacked
compliance.
We worked with those companies
and the vast majority of
companies are.
You know, easy to work with, uh,
and, and we got those into
compliance.
Of the ones that we ultimately
had to move toward cancellation.
We're talking about 2 dozen.
24 out of that 6000 where they
Refused to get a bond.
Or they weren't cleaning up or
they weren't doing something of
that sort. So I, I would agree,
and I do understand the
industry, I think over the last
6 years has seen an uptick in
terms of weight. Nobody was
paying attention to spills
before. Now you are. Uh, nobody
cared about bonding. Now you do?
Yes, that's gonna be something
that uh uh companies have seen
and uh but in terms of canceling
leases without cause.
Absolutely not the case. We only
do it when we have a a
justification, uh, to stand on
and they broke the terms of the
lease, and I would lastly, I
would add, we give them an
opportunity to cure.
Right? We provide notice, um,
and they have an opportunity to
cure and, and if repeatedly they
failed the cure, frankly, that's
on the bad actor. That's not on
us.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr.
Chairman, I really am deputy
commissioner, I really
appreciate that explanation
because it has been a concern.
And
I guess I'll just ask, um, very
simply, have you had leases that
were canceled that have been
released.
Least again at a higher rate.
Mr. Chairman, representative,
absolutely, right? So if you
have a bad actor who broke a
lease, um, and it gets
terminated and it was, you know,
most of our leases, probably
about 60% are at 12.5%, right?
As, as you know, because they
are held as long as they're
producing. So we have a lease
rate in effect from, you know,
1950s, 1940s, the chair referred
to at least from the twenties.
Um, so most of
our leases.
are at that lower rate. So if a
lease terminates.
We follow the statutory lease,
we follow state laws that exist
today, and we put it out to
lease under the current rate,
which is often uh uh well, it,
it is higher, um, so de facto,
yes, they would likely be leased
and people bid on them and they,
they win.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr.
Chairman, this is, um, I'm, I'm
just gonna ask one more question
on this and then move on.
So
Deputy, Mr. Chairman, Mr.
Chairman Deputy Commissioner,
it's your contention that
That
That the reason for the
cancellation of these leases for
the reasons that you outlined
and that was um they were out of
turn or they were out of
compliance in some manner, and
you did essentially everything
you could to get them back into
compliance.
Um, you had
Uh, a number that you had to um
cancel.
Um, you've taken whatever
remediation action or whatever
to make those marketable again
and they have since been
released.
At a higher rate because it's
essentially are the rates that
we have, but the reason for the
cancellation was not.
be able to release them. You
didn't lean over your skis to
cancel any leases. You guys
followed the law and you did
what you could, Mr. Chairman,
Mr. Chairman and Deputy
commissioner, is that fair? Mr.
Chairman Representative, that's
correct. And, and I also want to
point something out here because
I think it explains a lot of the
concern by industry, just the
way that we are are structured.
Our Lise agreement is with
The lessee
But the lessee may have lots of
operators, uh, you know, on
their leases with lots of
different wells, um, and those
operators may not be doing the
right thing. Um, but when we see
You know, to enforce the terms
of the lease, it is with the
lassee, and, and at times there
have been questions where an
operator, uh, who has a deal
with the lessee, says, Wait, we
never received notice. Why is
this happening? What's going on?
And we actually worked with
Nomoga to uh ensure that uh that
information of pending
cancellations is posted on our
website. So, you know, part of
the confusion here and some of
the challenges we've seen have
frankly been
Because of the structure where
the lessee.
Who's who we have the contract
with has all of these deals with
operators that we don't
necessarily have any contract
with.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr.
Chairman, I, and I imagine uh
you and I could talk a lot about
operating rights versus uh
record title, and I'm sure those
were some challenges for you and
perhaps we could have that
discussion, um, at some point,
but I don't want to take up the,
the committee's time with that.
Um,
Let's see, um.
I'll just, I'll make, make one
statement and then I'll move on
and and this I think maybe
speaks Mr. Chairman and Mr.
Chairman to the last discussion
between the deputy commissioner
and I.
And that is, is that we've been
assured that that the new taxes,
and I know this bill doesn't
speak to taxes so I'll make this
quick.
Aren't punitive and the industry
is not out of political favor.
But I believe this is either the
16th or 17th bill introduced on
the House side that's directed
at the industry. That coupled
with lease cancellations for
whatever reasons they may be, as
heightened the tension in the
industry, I would say, Mr.
Chairman, Mr. Chairman.
Deputy commissioner. So I
appreciate your explanation at
least regarding lease
cancellations and perhaps we can
turn the temperature down.
Um, best of the best, uh, one of
my favorite subjects because it
involves geology.
And uh um
It was mentioned, Mr. Chairman
and Mr. Chairman and Deputy
commissioner.
Um
That there were some tra state
tracks that have not, this is
the canary, these are the
canaries in the coal mine that
that I want to talk about a
little bit that I'm concerned
about.
Um
That the state land office.
Did not
Lease because they were not.
Uh, they did not get any bids.
On at least 6 tracks and I
believe it's 23 and 24.
That
6 tracks.
Um, in 20 and 24 that went out
at I believe it was a 20% rate,
and they got no bid, so Mr.
Chairman and Mr. Chairman,
that's a reflection of, of, of
industry, right? And it goes
back to what I said before and
that is, is that um,
Bonus term.
Uh, and royalty are all tied
together, um, that they all have
an impact on each other and so
Mr. Chairman and Mr. Chairman.
Um, I won't, I won't, uh, unless
you tell me otherwise I'll, I'll
just hold up the fact that
industry
proposed a smaller area, um, for
these the best of the best, and
it was really concentrated on
what we know about the geology
of the Southern Delaware Basin.
However, this bill actually
includes all of Eddy County, all
of Lee County, and Roosevelt, if
I recall.
No, not Roosevelt.
Just sliver in the bottom and
sliver in Southeast Chavis. I
got that right? OK, Mr.
Chairman, I'm I'm pretty close.
And so, what I would suggest to
you is, is that
Is that the first canary is this
one, and that is some company
has gone in there.
And provided and done an awful
lot of technical work because
they're ready to spend some
money on buying leases.
Yet these leases which are
between I wanna say.
I don't know, um.
10 to 30 miles outside the
industry best of the best area.
But in your best, excuse me,
your best in the best area, did
not receive a lease.
And that is saying to me that
there are
Areas that that are still
considered exploratory.
Within Eddie and Lee.
Especially in the the Northwest,
the north and the northeast
sides of, of the edges of the
basin.
That this higher royalty could
prevent some very important
exploration and I would suggest
to you once again going back to
a study where we really look at
not only the burdens that are
placed on the Mexico operators
through this bill and and others
Mr. Chairman.
Um, but we also consider the
geology of the basin.
And um it's not that dissimilar
on either side of the Texas
line.
But let me
If I could, Mr. Chairman, and
Mr. Chairman explained this.
We talk about the basin we're
basically talking about a bowl.
Right, where sediments are
flowing in and accumulating.
These stack up like layers of a
cake.
In the deeper part of the basin,
which is where the Texas and
Mexico line is, that's the
deepest part of the basin and
therefore those formations are
very, very thick.
They might be able to stand some
additional royalty.
But remember
If you're if I'm drilling a wolf
a bone spring wheel they're just
north of the Texas line.
And probably encounter that at
roughly 12,000 ft we're up near
Artesia I would probably
encounter at 8.
The differences outside of
Artesia, it might be 100 ft
thick and difference down the
state line might be 3 or 400 ft.
And I don't think that's been
considered anywhere in here.
And so
Um
I would, I would, uh, really
encourage, and I know at times
Mr. Chairman and Mr. Chairman
and Deputy commissioner, the
relationship may not have been
the best, but this is one where
industry could really help. I
would just suggest you in it,
and it could help in a way that
will not keep us out of these
new areas which we're gonna need
to explore it if we're gonna
keep this production up the way
this committee has talked about
it over the last, you know,
several weeks, but Mr. Chairman
and Mr. Chairman, um,
Oh, I, it just, that's, that's
the first canary, um.
Then, and I guess I would ask
Mr. Chairman, trying to get to a
question that Mr. Chairman is,
why didn't you like indu
industry's idea?
So, Mr. Chairman Rosan Murphy,
let me, let me take a stab at
that and I'll turn over to Mr.
Stewart, um.
When I worked on this bill last
year.
Uh, applied to the whole state.
Um, at no point did we say that
this 25%
Uh
Best of the best approach would
actually apply to the whole
state, just the bill applied to
the whole state. So we've
narrowed that.
Uh, that was, uh, Senator Munoz.
Um, to, you know, include the
smaller area to provide some
comfort to people outside that
area.
We still want to be inclusive.
We, we don't want to cut this so
finely that.
We're um leaving some of the
best tracks out of this area
where you can charge a fair
market rate.
So
We're not saying in drawing this
line around this area.
As is the bill does in words.
We're not saying that everything
inside that area will be a 25%
rate.
There will still be a variety of
rates 4 different plays within
uh that designated area.
What we're trying to do is
capture all of the properties
that will and should support the
25% royalty rate, so we're not
leaving anything.
Out
Mr. Stewart
Mr. Chairman Representative,
thank you for the, the, the
question because I think there's
a good opportunity to kind of go
through some of that thinking
about how we ended up here, but
also reflect a little bit about
how our leasing structure and
and royalty rates work, um, as
the chairman mentioned, you
know, we did have, uh, at the
beginning, we said we're going
to do um a bill that technically
applied to the state. It was
1875 to a new range of 25%.
That's what the previous
versions did, um, but the reason
why it only actually applied to
the premium is because there's
an existing statue in in 19103.
And every time we, well, let me
back up. First, we set these
broad areas, right? That for
potential leasing ranges. So the
new leasing range is 20 to 25%
in one particular area.
It's inclusive of the Delaware,
which I think we can agree is
is.
Pretty darn good, the best of
the best of the best, and then
it's probably and it is
inclusive of other areas that
are high production value, but
probably not as good. Um.
Within that range between 20 and
25%.
Each track that goes up, we need
to apply a set of statutory
factors, uh, that look at
geological um information and
market information. Um, so, you
know, and these are, are
petroleum engineer specialists
at the agency, and they come up
with a a rating for each one
that determines.
Uh, whether it should be a 25 or
whether it should be an 1875.
And usually we're pretty darn
good at at assessing the value
occasionally we might get it
wrong, um, uh, you mentioned the
6 leases that weren't leased.
Over the last 2 years, we leased
230.
Leases and 6 didn't get bits, so
of those 6, we just adjust the
rate and put them out again. We
put them out too high, but in
general we get that, that range,
uh, um, pretty, pretty close. In
terms of why we're not just
saying,
Just this area at 25 and we're
saying 20 to 25, and it is a
little bit broader. We need to
have some flexibility to look at
the individual characteristics
of the parcels that are being
put out to bid, um, and also we
do recognize, as you pointed out
at the beginning.
Unlike every other area.
We are constrained with an oil
and gas lease because it's in
statute, right? With a renewable
energy lease, we can get the
best market deal we can
negotiate with oil and gas were
were were constrained. So if we
put um uh a, a too narrow of a
limit in here and 5 years down
the road.
Good independent companies, you
know, discover something and it
has a huge value, uh, we
wouldn't be able to set it at
that higher 25% rate. So we need
to have some flexibility, but
that's how it's narrowed down
over the years, um, and, uh, it
maintains flexibility but still
focus.
Thank you for that explanation,
Mr. Chairman Chairman Deputy
Commissioner, um, I'm gonna hit
on it and I'm gonna try to wrap
this up pretty quickly. Um,
We had a discussion the other
day about um the reclamation
bill, and I think I pointed out
Um, fairly accurately and
Mr. Chair, Mr. Chairman, that
we've never seen a rate go down.
Uh, in my industry. And so, um,
this leads me to some concern,
and that is, is we have an
example of 6 tracks.
That
And granted, you know, I think
you said 230 you leased. So,
If we went into that, my guess
is that's probably in the best,
the best area, but
I'll, I'll leave that for
another discussion. My worry is,
is I know exactly what's going
on, uh, well, not exactly, but I
can as an explorationist have a
pretty good idea of what was
going on. Somebody had
Um, one of the first things I
was ever taught was that oil and
gas is discovered in the minds
of men and women.
And it's first got to be thought
of up here before we can go out
and find it out there. And my
guess, Mr. Chairman and Mr.
Chairman and Deputy commissioner
is you have some small oil and
gas company that thinks they
have an idea about a new play.
And those leases were
essentially priced out of the
market and I'm concerned, Mr.
Chairman and Mr. Chairman, and
that that will happen here. So
I'm gonna go to my second um
canary in the coal mine, and
So we've seen some specific
tracks that were leased because
quite frankly, they were above
market rate, in my opinion, Mr.
Chairman, Mr. Chairman.
But here's the overall trend
that we've seen, and this is
what also worries me.
is in the last 10 years, when
you look at activity on federal
lands versus state lands.
Activity on state lands has gone
down dramatically.
Um, you know, we've gone from
utilization from 53% to 68% on
federal lands.
we've gone from 38% on state
lands down to 24.
And so, uh, Mr. Chairman, Mr.
Chairman and Deputy
Commissioner, why is that?
Mr. Chairman Representative, I
think there's a lot of different
factors at play, but, you know,
on the federal side, you did
have, uh, in the, in the first
Trump administration, especially
a lot of leases that were issued
for a period of 10 years, um,
and, you know, they had time to
be able to to drill wells, um,
so, you know, I think if you
have an existing lease um and.
There's
You know, uh, uh, uh, an ability
to drill on it and at that time
they had a lower rate, uh, BLM
was at 12.5 at the time. They're
no longer at that rate. Um, I,
you know, companies are going to
take advantage of that.
Mr. Chairman, chairman and
Deputy Commissioner, thank you
for making that point for me
because uh that's one I've been
trying to drive home and I think
he maybe just did it better than
I have, so thank you for that,
Mr. Chairman Mr. Chairman, I'm
gonna conclude with this is that
I still don't believe that we
really know how competitive we
are.
When, and I think we ought to
give um
Serious consideration in this
committee to be thinking about
how we get that information, not
just, um.
Uh, the economics, but the
geology and, and, and perhaps
some uh
Um, some more stakeholder
involvement be useful, um, my
second point would be, I think
you're, it's a huge risk by
jeopardizing future discoveries,
especially on the fringes of the
basin.
Those are discoveries, Mr.
Chairman Chairman Deputy
Commissioner, that this state
has got to have. We're going to
continue the revenue streams and
the funding streams for all the
things that we're doing in this
body.
And then, um, I'll, I'll just
reemphasize that, that, that
second canary in the coal mine,
and that is the shift away from
state land office, um, activity,
and I'd suggest to you, it's,
it's a combination of things.
One is, um, it's, uh, the
regulatory requirements
generally in the state, but um
we certainly have seen um that
um increase from the state land
office over the last number of
years, so, uh, Mr. Chairman and
Mr. Chairman and Deputy
commissioner.
And obviously, I'm not gonna be
supportive of the bill today.
Um, and I appreciate both of
your times.
explanation. Thank you very
much. We're gonna go to ranking
member Montoya next.
Uh, thank you, um, Mr. Chairman
and uh Chairman Queen.
Um
I only have a couple of
questions that, frankly, uh, um,
Representative Murphy
I think captured the bulk of all
the questions.
Um, but
I guess this is for the deputy
commissioner.
Um
I'm wanting to see kind of, I
guess in the mind of the land
commission Office.
How
You see this playing out in
particular in light of the last.
A bit of the questioning from,
from
Representative Murphy.
We've seen
Uh, kind of a migration out of
public lands.
Uh,
For exploration and and
drilling.
Um, I, I'm, I'm.
I'm wanting to see how
OK
Yeah
In your mind
We continue maximizing.
Uh, dollars to go to to schools,
if, if, if there's a greater out
migration, I, I would, I would
believe this to be.
Counterproductive.
So, um
What's that, Mr. Chair. Mr.
Chairman, uh, Representative,
thanks for the question. So I, I
wouldn't characterize it as a
migration. I, I think the on the
federal side, there was
development growing faster as a
percentage of the pie, people
aren't leaving state trust land,
so I think that's an important
clarification, um, under this
commissioner, you know, we have
had the best, um, oil and gas,
uh, uh, returns in history of
the state land Office.
Uh, you know, last year was down
a little bit from, you know, 2.5
billion year before 2.7 billion.
So we're not killing oil and
gas. We are working with
industry when, uh, you know,
industry does well, the school
kids do well, so, um, I, I, I do
want to push back a little bit
on the notion that people are
leaving state trust line. I
don't think that's the case. I
think it's at the federal side
is, is growing and that's why
you're seeing that, that
percentage change uh there. In
terms of
we would envision this working.
We have very few leases that are
unleashed in the best of the
best areas.
Um, and
But they are very, very
valuable, um, and they're so
valuable that, you know, the,
the estimate is that we'll bring
in or we'll have distributions
from the permanent fund between
750 million and $1.3 billion
over, sorry, this is cutting
out. Um, over, you know, period
through through 2050. Um, so
what we envision is we will put
them up.
And they will get leased um at,
you know, uh, whether under this
new legislation, um, if they're
not the best of the best of the
best, they're going to be up to
20% rate if they are truly, uh,
you know, uh,
Right there in the Delaware
proven that's gonna be 25 and
it's gonna be um leased, so I
guess, uh, that's, that's the
way we see it working.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and,
and, uh, Chairman McQueen.
I guess probably if, if, if
we've maintained or increased, I
guess, uh, what we're talking
about is federal lands just
getting greater, greater market
share of new investment. That
would be a better
characterization is that
Uh, but I, I would say, Mr.
Chairman and Chairman Queen, I
think that is pointing to the
fact that
The federal leases are more
attractive.
Um, or private land.
Um, with that, Mr. Chair and
Chair McQueen.
Um, the reason I was asking the
question about how going
forward, if, if I could restate
your words and tell me if I
understood you correctly.
The
The state land office would look
at the Delaware, and that would
be considered the best of the
best of the best.
And
But is very well established as
our best play would be where the
25%.
Uh, would be
Put in place
But
Once again, tell me if I'm
wrong, what I heard you say is
as you move away from the basin.
Or move away from the Delaware.
In particular
That
The option would be 20% or
really, I guess there could be
rates of 23%.
22%, 20 they're they're.
Um, there's diff different
options there. That's what I'm
trying to figure out because uh
Mr. Chair,
Uh, Chairman Queen.
and deputy secretary
What I'm hearing from industry
is the concern about
How far out away from the
Delaware.
We would be looking at this new
higher royalty rate or some.
Mhm
Variation between 20 and 25%.
Mr. Chairman Representative, um,
uh, I, I guess I would just
Uh, I think, I think you've got
it right in general, um, what it
is anchored in is state law
though. So, um, the decision of
whether it should be 25 or 20 is
not going to be just a
willy-nilly decision. Um, state
law, Section 19103 lists out a
variety of factors, uh, you
know, um, uh, oil and gas
trends, oil and gas traps,
reservoir volume and reservoir
rating lease bonus rating,
exploration.
activity. Those are all in
existing state law, and they
constrain the state land
office's ability
to um set different lease rates.
So,
It's a point system uh that is
utilized, um, and so, you know,
we can't tell you right now this
lease is gonna be 25 and this
one will be 20 because that
would violate state law and
state law requires our
professional petroleum engineers
to go through that process. Um,
but I think generally you, you,
you have it right, you know,
there's a range within that
area, and based on, you know, if
it's farther away from really
proven.
is that we know absolutely
you're going to make a ton of
money. It's going to be on a
little bit lower end compared to
other areas.
And uh Mr. Chairman, uh, and
deputy secretary.
Um
Looking forward
Uh this
is open to who.
Is the next land commission as
to how this would be
implemented.
I assume
And Mr. Chair, I'm
I'm referencing that because uh
Two names of folks who might be
looking to run for that officer
sitting in this room today, so.
I'm wanting to
Um, make sure that
We understand this, this is up
for
what you're suggesting today.
is how you see this current.
Uh, secretary is looking at
this, um.
But that doesn't commit
I think that's, that's the
question in the minds.
Of
Uh, folks in the oil and gas
industry is that
This is could be broadly
interpreted rather than limiting
it to what we know is the best
of the best.
Um, concerned that
The future
Restrictions or future if, if,
um, as you know, Mr. Chair and
Chair Chair McQueen.
Um, the majority of folks who
stood up in favor of this are
Advocates who would like to see
oil and gas.
Exploration and production go
away completely.
Um
That's the concern. I mean, this
could be broadly interpreted.
By a future
A land commissioner.
As to being 25% on the entire
area.
That we just carved out.
Which would effectively, with
the exception of the Delaware.
cause there to be no future
exploration.
So Mr. Chair and Chairman Queen,
that is the concern.
That's the concern by industry.
Is that what we do today.
Even as you described how you
foresee uh
Mr. Deputy Secretary, how you
foresee this being implemented.
That's how you foresee it being
implemented for the next 2
years.
And the concern is
How would it be implemented
beyond that?
So
I, uh, I, I really don't have a
question here. I just wanted to
express the concern that I've
heard from industry.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, Chairman
McQueen.
Thank you very much, ranking
member Montoya. I don't see any
other questions. I'm gonna have
one quick question, then we'll
go to Representative Garcia with
the motion, uh.
Sort of, uh, in that scenario
that the ranking member just
outlined, chair, deputy
commissioner.
My understanding would be that
uh there would be a wide range
of beneficiaries who if there is
sort of a clear pattern, um,
Over the, over sort of a wide
range of areas.
That the whoever is commissioner
would be sort of out of
compliance with the
Constitution.
Would there be cause for suit if
Uh, lease rates are being
applied to exclude production in
your opinion?
Mr. Chair, um,
So
We have the commissioner has a
fiduciary responsibility to the,
to the trustees and and and and
those are the beneficiaries, um,
uh, to the trust, and, you know,
they may not be able to um
It's, it's an open legal
question whether frankly they
have legal standing to be able
to bring suits in terms of that.
But I, I think the broader point
is in terms of restraining, you
know, the concern that was
raised, um.
Uh, about
You know, any land commissioner
doing a different thing.
This is state law. The the lease
is in statute. I mean, this is a
very restrictive approach. We
have nothing like it in anywhere
else in in the state land office
uh law. So it it it restrains
any other land commissioner in
the future to follow the law
and, and we have existing state
law as I had indicated with a
variety of factors that uh limit
how lease rates are set. So, um,
I, I guess I would say any
future land commissioner is, is
frankly, uh, they have a
fiduciary responsibility that
they have to meet, uh, and
they're also constrained by, by
state law and ultimately,
everybody needs to follow that.
OK, great. Thank you very much.
uh, Mr. Chair, anything to add
before we go to uh
representative Garcia.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. um, just
wanted to make a couple of
points, um, first off,
In discussing whether it's a
tax or royalty, you know, I
would suggest that if you were
running.
A chain of grocery stores, and
you had the lease of building.
Uh, your lease payments are not
a tax.
It's a cost of doing business.
Uh, if you happen to lease a
building from a governmental
entity for some reason.
still not attacks. I mean, it's
It's not a tax because it's not
something we're imposing on
people. It's something the state
owns.
And people are bidding on, you
know, it's a voluntary
transaction.
Um, I'd also like to just touch
on the role of the land office,
um.
You know, the role of the land
office is to make money for
education.
So like I, I.
cannot imagine a land
commissioner.
You thought the oil and gas
development should go away.
It would be inconsistent with
the constitutional mandate of
the office.
And what I heard from.
Mr. Stewart, which I have heard
before, actually we heard this
from uh EOG.
Was that they viewed the land
office uh as a partner.
And that's how I think they
should be viewed.
And it's sort of it's music to
my ears that they have that.
That type of relationship, and I
don't see anything in this bill
or really anything in the future
that would change that.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Great.
Thank you very much Mr. Garcia.
Um, Mr. Cha I move, I do pass
recommendation on Senate Finance
Committee substitute for House
Bill 23.
OK, it's been moved by uh
Garcia, seconded by
Representative Abeta. Uh, can we
please call the roll?
Representative Abeta, yes.
Representative Dixon.
Representative Garcia.
Representative Grola, yes.
Representative Henry
Representative Montoya? No.
Representative Murphy? No.
Representative Senator Cortez?
No.
Represent a small.
Vice Chair said Inana.
Cherry McQueen.
Yes
OK, uh, by a vote of 54, uh, we
have a due pass on Senate
Finance Committee substitute for
Senate Bill 23.
OK. Thank you for that. It is.
10:40 uh we're typically
expected on the floor at 10:30.
I have not received notice that
roll call is opened.
So we can continue, um.
Is
There's in here.
There he is.
Represent Pettigrew. So, um,
Yeah, that's mine.
Thank you for that.
Um
I, I've asked to be notified
when roll call opens.
Um, I don't know how much to be
we're gonna have on your bill.
Uh, I, uh, would ask you to
present the bill. We will go to
the public. Uh, it's probably in
your interest to be brief.
Thank you, Chairman and thank
you for your time today. I 273
is a solution-based bill for New
Mexico's energy crisis.
Purpose is to provide a clean
additional source of input for
the generation.
Of affordable electricity and
reducing greenhouse gas
emissions by over 60%.
I spilled 273 is a necessary
step towards ensuring that
balanced energy.
It is reliable, affordable, and
sustainable.
The bill would amend the rural
Electric Coop Act and the
renewable renewable Energy Act
to include natural gas.
Using combined cycle technology.
As renewable energy resource.
Grounded in both science and
practicality.
Mr. Chair and committee, what we
know right now.
Is that our tech companies
across the United States and
across the world are pushing
their green.
Energy goes aside in building a
natural gas plants across this
country.
Microsoft
Building a $3.3 billion.
Data center in Wisconsin that
will be powered by natural gas.
Meta 4 million square foot data
center in Louisiana off the
delta powered by natural gas.
Next air planned natural gas
expansions.
Their CEO John Ketchum.
We've got to find sites. We've
got to develop these sites, and
we've got to get gas to these
sites.
Engine number one.
An investment firm has ousted.
It ousted 3 ExxonMobil board
members in 2021 is now
partnering with Chevron and GE
Renova to build enough new gas
generation centers.
The power of 3 million homes.
Calling it part.
Calling it part of an all of the
above strategy.
Open in Stargate collaboration,
the 1st 16 data centers.
The first of 16 data centers
will be in Abilene, Texas,
powered by natural gas. Recent
growth in the natural gas
facilities worldwide 670%
increase in natural gas
facilities since 200 since 2022.
I
Happy to go through the details
on that from the key things that
we need to realize about.
Where we're going with respect
to energy.
Each generation capacities.
Concentrated solar.

Clean energy
Mr. Chair and committee, the
average renewable lifespan.
It is 8 years
What we have not done is talk
about the continual push towards
renewable, and there has been no
study whatsoever done on the
mineral drawdown for removal,
disposal and replacement.
And that's to take care of time.
I will open up for questions.
OK.
Um, by a show of hands in the
audience who's here in support
of this bill.
Uh, who's here in opposition?
Oh
OK.
We're gonna do uh support first.
We'll take 3 from the audience.
You like to speak, please step
forward.
And you'll have 2 minutes.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and
committee members. My name is
Bernard Treat registered
lobbyist for XL Energy, in
particular Southwestern Public
Service here merely to support
the bill.
Because we're in favor of
Any energy source that'll help
us meet a rapidly growing
demand. Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Chair and
committee members. I'm Larry
Sontag here for the New Mexico
Business Coalition. House Bill.
273 allows for broader, more
diversified energy. This
diversification can lead to more
stable energy prices for
businesses, reduced reliance on
less predictable renewable
sources and enhance the
resilience of the energy grid.
Combined cycle technology is
known for its efficiency,
converting more of its fuel
energy, as Bill sponsor
mentioned by incentivizing its
use through renewable energy
classification, we can encourage
the adoption of this high
efficiency practices. We
encourage you to support House
Bill 273. Thank you. Good
morning, Mr. Chair, members of
the committee. My name's Paul
Gessing. I'm president of the
Rio Grande Foundation. Rarely do
bills come before you that are a
win, win, win, but this bill
would be just such a bill
because it would
Provide clean, affordable, and
Economically development,
economic development friendly
energy to New Mexico, uh, being
more steady and reliable then
Renewables, wind and solar, it
would provide New Mexico the
kind of energy supply it needs
to attract AI and other
technology intensive and energy
intensive industries to our
state. So this is a great
opportunity to use a resource
that we have in plentiful supply
here in New Mexico, natural gas
for the economic benefit of our
state, while also producing
clean and affordable
electricity. Thank you.
OK, we're gonna take 2 more
online, uh, if you are in
support of this bill and would
like to speak. Please raise your
hand.
OK, I'm not seeing any, so we'll
come back to the room for
opposition. Again, we'll take 3
from the room. You set forward.
And just for the record, uh,
half the room just stood up. OK.
Mr. Chair, also for the record,
just about that many stood up in
favor.
Yeah, your math is different
than mine. I didn't see that
many.
Good afternoon committee.
Chair and committee members. My
name is Bernadette Hardy. I'm
here as a lobbyist with EM
Native vote. I'm Hamish Papa and
Dana. Um, when I was younger in
middle school, we were taught
natural gas, and methane gas is
a non-renewable fossil fuel.
This bill won't change that.
When a non-renewable fossil fuel
is extracted, vented, flared,
leaked, and combusted. It
damages our air, water, climate,
and health. It doesn't matter
how you burn fossil fuels or how
many cycles up a power plant
has, if it relies on a dirty
non-renewable fuel, it is not
renewable.
And while combined cycle is more
efficient and simple cycle
technology, it tends to need to
run more.
To achieve that efficiency.
It undermines the purpose of the
renewable Energy Act, which is
to ramp down the climate
pollution, not to add more
polluting facilities. Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman,
members of the committee. I'm
Charles Goodmacher. I'm here on
behalf of both Healthy Climate
New Mexico and earthworks. And
you may like natural gas, but
calling it a renewable energy
source absolutely makes no
sense.
The renewable or reputable
industry journal renewable
Energy defines renewable energy
as that energy made from
renewable natural resources.
That are replenished on a human
time scale, the most widely used
renewable energy types or solar
energy, wind power, hydropower,
bioenergy, and geothermal.
The International Energy Agency
defines renewables.
Energy derived from natural
processes that replenished at a
faster rate than they are
consumed.
No science or evidence-based
policy anywhere defines natural
gas as a renewable energy
source, please vote against
this. Thank you.
Good morning, chair, members of
the committee. My name is Justin
Garroot. I'm with Conservation
Voters New Mexico and their
climate and energy advocate, and
I want to let you know that this
bill is an attempt to redefine
renewable energy and are really
an attempt to include
non-renewable fossil fuel-based
natural gas as part of the
renewable portfolio. This
attempt is directly out of the
conservative American
legislative Exchange Council AEC
playbook. This bill would
significantly change the rural
electric cooperative Act,
limiting our
ability to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, according to Governor
Lu Hong Grisham's 2019 executive
order on climate. Please oppose
this bill. Thank you.
OK. Thank you for that. And then
we're gonna go online, um, we'll
take 2 in opposition if you
would like to speak in
opposition to this bill, please
raise your hand.
Daniel Pritchard.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and
committee members.
My name is Daniel.
And research and education
organization here in North
Central Mexico.
Don't be fooled, you've
misinformation
gas cycle is still burning
fossils to create heat energy.
This needs to stop. Just massive
natural gas power plants does
not mean that these are needed
in New Mexico.
So you need a lifetime,
150 years more, not 8 years,
and it is much cheaper than the
new natural gas plants
cooperative here in town is the
5 megawatts of 20 megawatt hours
of battery storage. They
expected cost of the power
scheme is about 4 cents a
kilowatt hour. This is the
lowest cost. Thank you.
Thank you for that and uh Gene
Larson.
Good morning. This is Jean
Watson and I represent the
League of Women Voters of New
Mexico.
Uh, the legal position that we
support renewable energy to
every extent possible and uh we
have checked our sources for the
scientific basis for whether uh
natural gas is renewable or not,
and here's what it says gas is a
nonrenewable fossil fuel from
the remains of tiny plants and
animals that died 300.
100 million years ago. Uh, no
way could we say that natural
gas is a a a uh resource.
Therefore, we support opposition
to this bill. Thank you.
OK.
That ends our public comment.
Uh, thank you all, um, who
participated. Um, so I've been
told that roll call is opened.
Uh, I've had some discussions
with the ranking member that
Yeah.
The reality is, we haven't been
starting right away.
Of course, part of that reality
is,
In order to make warm and start,
we need to be down there to push
our buttons since
Only one party pushes their
buttons to begin with.
Um, and there are, you know, 7
members of that party in this
committee, one of whom is, is
absent.
So
Uh, we have 6 who are here
today.
Um, so, so that's, that's my
dilemma. It's like, yeah.
They don't start until 11:30 if
we don't show up until 11:30
because they're not able to make
it for.
So I'm going to pause here. Uh,
we've had a presentation, we've
had public comment.
We'll put you back on the agenda
again, I think that'll be the
4th time um.
And, you know, if we pick it
back up, we, we can dive right
into the discussion without
doing public comment again.
But because I feel like we're
needed on the floor.
Uh, we're gonna roll the bill
and pause at this point, uh.
Represent Maya? Yes, Mr. Chair,
I would ask that at the very
least in consideration, this is
the 4th time this has been on
here. I
I would ask that we put it at
the front.
Of the agenda on Thursday. I
don't believe it'll be a long
discussion, but I think it's an
important discussion.
Um
Represent my all consider that.
Let me, let me look at what the
agenda looks like, um,
Uh, I, I would say the first
time, uh it was on the agenda,
it was rolled at the request of
the sponsor, so it hasn't always
been all our fault, uh, but
thank you for that, um, thank
you, everyone, we are adjourned.
