Very strong claimant message.
With regards to.
The oil community you heard some
major producer.
I want you to know that they're
an important part of our economy
but that doesn't mean their
support doesn't mean that
they're not going to be held
accountable.
Action is on our environment.
For our oil and gas.
In a clean fuel m.
This bill as it stands will.
Exist right now to sell their
mething that they cap.
Right now.
My colleague mission will kind
of discuss more at length on the
digesters and you know where the
dairy community is but we are
open to rec.
The capture and participate in
the clean.
More about.
The.
Thank you macqueen I would just
say one other point is that
without this bill as technolog.
Without this b.
The.
And we wanted to make sure that
this program the clean f.
Any p.
Could.
We.
This is the amendment.
Twenty four hours in two
minutes.
So i'm disappointed.
You're close to that.
The.
It's.
Not a common.
Reflected by the concerns.
The.
Is.
Of the metro tone.
I believe so but we have to
confirm.
Last name is or.
The.
The.
I'm not sure what you're you're
asking me to do to make an
amendment to the bill represent.
Yeah.
Now so for the hypoth.
So they focus.
Eighty one.
Some of those mark.
The.
The.
The.
The.
That's this.
We are not.
I believe they.
That we've seen in the analy.
As part of the program that is
one will be.
The program.
The.
The.
The.
The.
The.
But.
Is that.
That you're mentioning the way
that it actually w.
Build.
I think.
By the thirteen to sixteen
million met.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean.
If someone is.
They will have to purchase a cr.
Is that as.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is not.
The.
The real n.
But.
That comp.
Individual and I want to be
clear well I I don't think it
was actually clear it could have
sounded to me like.
Yeah.
For new mexico for new mexico
only.
We haven't developed.
The.
The.
We know.
For the challenges th.
But here's what we do we know
that last year or or as far as
the life time of the.
The.
The.
The.
The fuel producer.
That's really where th.
I want to be clear that.
We're addressing that is I
insuring one way.
Of an increasing gra.
It just isn't tied you ma.
Just a few d.
And I was very very sad that two
days later it went up to two
eighty seven I wish I had filled
up again but I couldn't because
I already filled up rate that
that was in a matter of two days
had nothing to do.
Global market condition.
Yes.
The.
If if it looks like.
Are the environment departments.
Um.
Sheep that program but.
Yeah.
Low local.
The.
I.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
That charges the battery.
Then.
The.
Actually.
I too am nervous and sweating
but you're not sweating just so
we are talking about electricity
we are not talking about.
So.
How do.
Yeah.
You know so the transportation.
The.
That.
Yeah.
And so.
There are.
The.
But.
Yeah
how we put the in yes payg
applying the clean transp.
So that is that science space
measure that.
So.
Mister chairman.
We've heard a lot about.
For the children opening.
The assessment and and and what
i'm trying to.
In the ****.
On page two.
The.
And
depending on what.
You know which includes already.
That is under n.
And so i'm not sure exactly but
it's something to consider I
mean it is for all of the
products that we buy were in a
global.
There's always there could
always.
Want to make.
Is.
Life cycle possible and not.
Is.
Mentioned.
Taking it.
The thirteen million.
In the atmosphere.
We look at all these other trade
offs that were.
It's worth it.
I like spend
is not just metric tons of
carbon being
being reduced in india measures
is not just that though it is
that's important and you may
think that number is small and
it seems small but it is a green
house gas that's being removed
from the atmosphere
but the incentives also around
a clear fuels decrease other
pollutants grandlabel so that is
what impacts communities
community health it is what
impacts are incomplete
especially in rural areas that
will be reduced as well
the economic benefits of of all
the industries that are already
here would like to do this work
the industries that like to move
into this are into the state to
to develop please feels that's
impacted in AP.
Well to sell with that with that
investment going right into long
communities that's a benefit as
well.
Representative or t.
On the health issue
what.
Have shown us.
Or fifty four fight
but what what
what has been shown in those
areas you.
Persons.
I don't.
And they don't look good our
respiratory and
our respiratory illness doesn't
look good our ground level zone
readings and a lot of the
communities in our state don't
look good and that's why we're
here today to protect the.
New mexicans are breathing and
ensure the beauty of this
program is that we can do that
and ensure economi.
And
that's why we keep bringing this
bill back and we keep.
We're going to miss out in new
mexico if we don't.
I've seen and heard everybody is
asking me on I forty wire all
the.
We have a renewable disall drop
in fuel that can be u.
Using vehicles now we can't use
them because they're all going
to the western markets let's
stop that let's have these.
I I understand where you say th.
But that that doesn't.
That I don't think that w.
The question is given the
paceline what the fact will this
actually have and what effects
has it had in the.
I think well actually I
so if you don't have those.
Not go back to that
so much unknown.
We have presented data that
there'll be thirteen.
It reduced that's from trans.
We all know a co pollution of
that is ground level ozone so I
can get back to you on the
numbers of what we inte.
Those other states have
significant investments in other
kinds of programs but we can do
our best to pro.
We can answer part of your
question
so
organ is looking at in this is
the value.
Carb.
They're seeing an annual public
health savings of eighty million
a year
we know that policies that
reduce the fuel carbon intensity
reduces air pollution mortality
we will get these studies to you
that show that evidence that is
that is what we know so far and
I think it really has an impact
on low income community
especially will income
communities of color
who are disproportionally
impacted by a transportation
pollution so with a clean field
standards were seeing an organ
that there are exposer exposure
reductions in those low income
community so it's.
There's a used tea davis study.
How how long do you.
The before.
The.
That mister chair and represent
him recognition elaborate on
what this is
the market.
Mister chair.
Infrastructure.
The ability.
Cleaner.
All the things.
How do you expect this to take
share of a queen representative
a lot of it is existing and
under way now so for example for
investor owned utilities
you know excellent
they have a transport.
Required to submit the required
to meet that investment they're
doing it now they're providing
the incentives now that's true
for the other investor owned uh
utility areas to
their are things that need to
happen further and faster this
bill will do that because it
provides more in.
Program to excellent what they
are already doing
as far as infrastructure now for
differ.
So is a drop in.
A process that refines the buyer
fuel.
And so if you own a decent
diesel ver.
It's useful down and southeast
new mexico
this is awesome this is so great
let's do it
the other thing that there are
by a few stations.
You know I
there's always going to be more.
A funding stream for the
necessary.
Further accelerate and need
gaps.
Thank you.
That refining station.
And I might be run on th.
Thank you mister chairman.
Representative for tears this
mo.
Thank you.
I.
Yeah.
Yeah thank you very much.
Congratulate him really.
I think first.
Four hundred.
And I should add that these are
in our st.
Quick start projects so this is
in.
We looked at what we could start
doing today whether it is.
You know thread the needle on
methane digi.
My sense is that.
Representative yes we have
provided on our website.
I'd to the clean fuels market
with and so that's one of the
great parts of this program as
well is that it really helps um
we're all new mexicans please.
Thank you.
Yeah.
The.
That's exactly.
Not only.
But.
Their operations the.
The other great part about
something like renewable t.
All of the global factors that
we know go into the black box.
And so this provides a very
certain.
It's different than all.
Yeah.
The.
Chairman representative small
and costs in terms of.
Respiratory.
There there's no doubt.
Expensive for her
this is not a cost that.
We think that there will be
a reduction in in those types of
reps respiratory illnesses right
now there are communities that
are exceeding zone levels that
are sort of leading to
an attainment I think that.
Something that we want for these
communities that.
Thank you for going through that
i.
As the fact that we're investing
in new mexico bringing.
Yeah.
Zero.
Representative montoya.
I I don't know what you're
talking about in particular can
you just narrow.
Or again.
Generated the mark.
The wealth generated from the
market.
And.
That was the utility peace of
the clean fuel credit that they
received that they.
It the.
Macqueen representative that
would be.
Fuel credit sta.
Invested in the clean f.
Representative of.
Understanding.
Yeah.
Before you do.
The committee in the staff we do
have.
Yeah.
Mr chair may we just take a
quick like five second standing
break.
Representable
mister
thank you.
Of course you've been talking
about.
Miano like piano.
The.
The.
We're starting at.
So.
Able.
They're going to have.
They're going to have to pay.
So ra.
The.
I i'm so glad that you brought
up consumer advocates consumer
reports.
Which represents community it's.
Writing researching on behalf of
the consumers supports this bill
in fact they just took an ad out
in the cent.
But what you mentioned about
the.
A consumer advocate should
should be advocating on behalf
of the consumer I whole
heartedly agreed let's let's
make sure that that task force
has that person but I think that
these advocates are all
consumers and they're advocating
on behalf of the con.
So I grateful for your comments
about that.
Has an expert.
I disagree around some of the
the percentage.
The blended.
And only above fifteen percent
is where we would need to make
modifications on a vehicle as
in.
And this is I think a great
opportunity.
And you know other companies but
really utilities to focus on
helping those consumers.
Had really thought of and i'm
thinking about how that could be
i'm have a a stronger impact in
this low income communities I I
just want to point out that
that minority is a word that is
not that I don't use for myself
I just want to clarify are you
talking about loan computers of
color his final communities need
of indigenous communities cause
that is not a m.
Probably a good idea and
representative montoya I I think
I captured the the comments I
wanted to make right now aro.
The.
How we've made changes to this
bell
one of the things that we've
seen around for.
As far as what would make the
most sense for r.
Right now are.
This bill is not an electric
vehicle b.
That are able to be used.
We know the transportation
elect.
And so
I just wanted to make that point
as well.
Absolutely do research and
comment and right and advocate
for the use.
They are not just for new
vehicles or new products they
talk a lot about okay so thank
you for that one's too.
I do have a question on the b.
Yes there is a.
Asked has been challenged on.
Uh so.
We have done the research.
Happening here the one.
Is that.
The separate market I know
you know there are a lot of
markets there state markets and
federal markets as all of the
private companies.
This is not
carbon.
We heard some of the con.
As far as how this m.
Then a carbon offset market and
so that's why we expect that.
That's why we expect new mexico
here to have the real economic
and hel.
S market is actually more
prescriptive in statute and so
we don't have that.
New mexico.
That's one of the reasons why
we have put those skeleton on
the bill but have left some
peace.
That works for all new mexicans
and so there are a lot of
similarities in the structure
but oregons right now is much
more prescriptive because it's
existed for.
Have put the same guard general
guard.
Yeah.
And that's true true for all of
the federal markets that exist
is.
And there is.
Those emissions are exceeded in
this
market.
Comes from.
There's generate the credits
that are then purchased by.
I did look.
The right definite.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
And just.
I'm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Transition.
The.
This.
That's a great questi.
I think that
we are we are looking at.
To any market.
And we look at this
standard
with its focus I think on
ensuring that low income
communities are not left behind
really focused on choice we want
to give cons.
Whether they're driving an
elect.
That this is what we're
incentive.
And I think it also helps new
york.
Oil gars companies somewhere gu.
Proclaim their their support.
Yeah.
You know.
Over time yes but quickly
quickly it's really what we're
hoping and especially around the
incentives to those.
The.
So my next point.
It's very important.
So.
I mean invitations were given
absolute all kinds of folks so
including.
You've got you know if you're
not.
There there are some great
phrase that is about conclusion
I think i'm actually quite
hungry at this well
I
we will insure that there is
inclusion especially among the
the fuel producers they have
they have given a lot of input
the ad community needs to be at
the table.
Yeah.
So I guess.
I think that we are not in a
position.
The other thing and i'm just
going to say this is a sight.
Because I think.
Yeah.
Issues regarding multimod.
The.
Yeah.
A.
Bikes.
Within the confines of.
No it was.
The way
to eighty five
I thought about this bill.
The farmers but it brought.
The.
And I think you know
it does place.
There are going to be.
But.
The.
There's nothing in this
and and I want to say that that
evidence does not support
increased costs.
I think that there is great
sentence incentive for the
agricultural community
especially around around derry
so there is potential to m.
When once we figure out the
techn.
There will be opportunities
there.
Well.
That creates an incentive
possibly light as we.
So.
I wanted to just also.
That memorial.
That would.
No that's one o.
We were looking.
So I just wanted to.
I think that.
The.
Yeah.
But it.
So with the atmosphere.
Thank you
thank you mister chair.
My question is is what if you
don't own a car.
I guess my question.
Yeah.
The other benefits of of this
type of program.
Impacted by the considerable up.
So in creating the incentives to
reduce emissions to reduce those
politicans will have a benefit
for folks who are pedestrians
who are bike writers
it could also lead to potential
investments by the.
Bike lanes and trails walking
tr.
Including anything especially
pedestrians who are walking our
writing to work or wherever you
there will be if you were
emissions which means.
A lot of time.
I'm excited.
I.
Yeah.
Twenty three alone and after the
hottest year and history people
know you have to.
The.
When you said.
It.
The legislators we are
legislators that.
My job is a letter.
We're talking about thousa.
Thank you.
Yeah.
What in the in the concrete what
this bill is talking about.
So let's start mister chair.
The.
What.
What.
What is
the chair and then lastly.
So how.
What are examples of.
But that the electric vehic.
And I will explain this as part
of a utility example so.
They as an inve.
Yeah.
Part of those plans.
As part of their application to
the p r c so one of.
How does their plan.
Low income and.
What they're doing to fund th.
You know here are our.
And do and what this bill can do
and how we've drafted it.
The.
This not only do.
Because what we know in the laws
of new mexico is.
That they can sell.
And so that inc.
All.
On.
But provide more income.
Yeah.
What we're doing here for p and
em for example they have gone.
Here's what it's going to look.
Want because.
The electric utility
what the electric utility is
already doing and so this new
income stream for pn will allow.
More infrastructure.
Because they have all this.
Till it is l.
It says requir.
Our projection.
Because as representative months
we know it is.
And so for a t.
To invest all.
They're going to make them and
then they.
To.
And great modernising.
That support transportation.
Percent of those revenue
supporting low income and under.
Because we know that a utility
like pn.
They're going to decarbonize
their energy mix over time.
Credits in a certain way in that
way is to th.
Have been overlooked in the past
we don't want those communities
to be left behind as part of any
new program that we.
The.
We are creating a.
The and the market decides what
the credit value is so it is a
m.
The.
That.
As a result of this of us
setting the carbon intensity
standard.
They have a renewable person.
That inst.
But then what's going to happen
as they're because they also
sell.
It's probably not going to meet
that that that's probably gonna.
Going to.
And so when you have a situat.
Have to buy the credits and.
I hope that helps but
more confusing that you're you
know that i.
The bills.
Eighteen levels.
Twenty percent below twent.
The the standard th.
But we'll get to those actual
numbers.
We representative i'm not sure
what you're looking at are you
seeing that your.
Out.
Okay.
To clarify that would be the.
So that amount that were
project.
I believe it's by twenty.
Year that's over.
Yes.
The.
The.
It's created.
Represents got yes an
additional.
The.
Looks.
The.
Yeah.
The.
This.
Which is the question which is
just the question.
Which response.
If.
Right.
The.
That would in a since me g.
And so what we have done this
this year.
Of the program.
Markets
will be able to take emergency
art will be able t.
The.
The.
Mister chairman.
The.
Yeah.
And it was.
That.
That company is in business.
I would.
The.
Mothers can.
The.
Third.
This bill.
Yeah.
The.
The.
The.
So i.
Yeah.
Quite a bi.
New mexico will incentivise
businesses to come here and stay
here cleaning the air and
providing the utilities.
Money to invest.
Representative but I go.
Representative yeah yes
representative hembr.
Representative.
Represent.
Representatives
represent.
Representative.
The.
Mr chamber.
This serving in the.
Especially.
Particularly.
Organizing and governing that
much floor i.
Yeah.
Yeah.
First.
The.
Second I meant to mention th.
Practice building we have
everyone right now which is
great.
Yeah.
The.
So.
So we'll take a very process.
The.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
