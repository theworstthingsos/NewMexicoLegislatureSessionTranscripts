Thank you as the chairman of the
end of the US.
state representative begin by.
US district fourteen
A district kind of covers some

although we'll get and
unincorporated Lee County but
the school.
and I'm in my twenty seventh
year state Rep.
initially served on this
committee when I came in.
As a rookie and that I'm ninety
seven.
under the leadership of our
Roger Montana.
Was no longer with us but you
Roger was the first Pueblo to
ever be elected to the state
legislature and that is not
Chairman it's an honor to
chairman this committee under
your leadership I see is one of
more of expanding the Germans
of.
legislature and also on I'm in
the very
good
company with our most elder the
public is thank in the.
Unlike the.
Thank.
The.
The committee you know I mean
the state for.
The filter Senator also share
but when the state.
You know I was a.
when I was about twelve thirteen
years old.
myself and some other comments
from the bottom but I was born
and raised in New Mexico.
Establish the our own our
company.
And the the way we did it is
that you know when you're a
check on on the body on here
about eleven thirteen years all
of you you build a sugar shack.
You know and that's what we did
we move the sugar shack
stolen number from the neighbors
houses
and
a number of sheet rock roshi
material you name it but Mr
chair.
We went to the railroad track is
that will be that which is that
I know the borders Robert
taxes and less I can carry.
and we picked up the the line
then.
Would continually
change batteries and lanterns
and they just one but several
tracks so what's more cheap that
you cannot use would do like us.
We gather these used batteries.
And we we talk about maybe four
dozen of them stack them up in
the sugar shack.
Negative power negative about
the
negative to positive negative
the positive and the positive
then we we have tested to up on
that wall.
And we were one of the few and
that houses in our body would
like to see.
Researchers on the out of the
that that you basically a
kerosene lamps to light their
houses it's in that smartphones
that had no electricity so they
come in they kind of you know
kind of this kind are Strickler
shack with this let us.
You know that was so funny in
this creative in on that but
that kind of Mister chair I got
Mr chair that conditions the the
ingenuity of for partials.
The kind of get things done for
the better and you know and and
and that kind of being create
our own technology from scratch.
I just want to share that with
the committee in the audience.
Thank you representative of you
are let's see we've a long way
but obviously there's the
committee Mexico have a look
through.
So we do so.
The process.
So I understanding Israel allow
is this a million views of.
It demonstration they said we we
work at the scene in this
meeting because it was
organizational but I mean to be
part of recent doing
organizational meeting is sort
of figure out you know what else
we need to we need to do so
we're gonna do that our first
meeting which.
I'm gonna guess is unfortunate
because hi Sir expect that
problems so I know there are and
what doesn't work.
I know there are people is the
if you want just by
hopefully we'll have to if you
wanna make sure you testified at
least we as we begin that
probably makes sense to be here
first.
I understand that the they're
working on the rules for
consideration of possible
adoption that.
Either in the committee or on
this for if you are ill you
would be able to participate
for.
hi.
I hope they don't those rules
because I think if you repeal
you should be.
Just.
To protect the rest of the
committee and staff.
Separated which now I have a
comment Mr chair
since I'm a new member and I've
been the person watching the
webcasts at home and I
participated in the Google
webcast
I just wanted to mention that
when we show a video.
The audience on the webcast
cannot see it.
So I don't know if the state is
working on trying to resolve
that issue but there's been a
couple times I've been on
webcast and they showed video to
the audience or you know to the
members but nobody can see at.
Remotely so I just wanted to
mention that because I I almost
mentioned that yesterday we were
in.
Session
And where those two days before
I jump right in so so I
appreciate that the good news is
we rarely do anything like that
during sessions this is
something we do more often in
in our
local communities.
But I would encourage anyone to
do that through this
We are a two state.
We are a Tuesday Thursday
committee today's Thursday.
Of the.
you know it being a Tuesday
Thursday committee.
Time is of the essence of don't
get as many meetings as of the
committees in the past we have
met on Saturday.
I'd rather not be the answer but
I also want to get through the
bills to get sciences.
so my advice would be your
studies of this problem with
some of the.
Thank you Mr chairman do you
have any idea of the workload
this year I know that we got a
sixty day session so.
Have plenty of time.
Wondering if you have have an
idea the.
We have I think that the first
slightly bill that we got for
your actually the second
committee on the Google.
Which is usually were first
thing to do and then if you get
through your.
So the overall work will.
So it's.
Saturdays tech testimony.
personal.
This they would have any
questions.
Staff questions anything I'm
forgetting about the number.
One comment if you're going to
change your districts online
redistricting get out like a
county so I only cover Chavis
counties of the review of the.
Okay the the the need to catch
up on that but.
That's really all at.
Thank you everyone for coming we
will
to see a question the answer we
will have a meeting Thursday
morning are to be Tuesday
morning we will publish the
agenda I think we submitted
tomorrow.
we you know we tried being
twenty four hours in advance to
get tool type maybe at the end
of the session
but we will we will do that
there's a state representative
Scott and I have built
To make it easier for the public
to see a proposed amendments in
committee sept
this bill passed the house
unanimously last year Senator so
we'll try that again it's a very
good on that it's rule change is
when they we sent out the
committee said the the committee
you know twenty four hours in
advance that was the the website
so people can see it is we are
two years the situation where we
have a controversial bill and we
have thirty people from the
public you know we're set about
one provision that's been taken
out from the center they just
don't know because they have.
So we're trying to try to
address that will second is that
rural passes will take effect
for oil.
work through that this.
Did you at.
Thanks for the opportunity to
have in the past there's been
limitations on immigration.
Morning will there be any.
that's a good question in
Well I tend to do is play by ear
if we have a bill that all
handful of only two or three
people want to spy on you know
all us to be brief but I will
put a lock on you if we have
thirty or forty people online
want this fight it's going to be
two minutes.
So it just depends on.
It also.
