The gentleman from Bernalillo.
Thank you Mr chairman we go to
ex services announcements and
miscellaneous business carrying
objections ordered can members
we're gonna do some housekeeping
some committee reports and then
once we do those.
We will publish.
We'll get to some account around
we discussed it with floor
leadership from both parties we
can't publish it to the members
until we do the committee
reports gentleman from Chavis
Eddy and Otero.
Mr speaker if I might.
This morning and over the last
couple of days.
Really for the last probably
five or six days there has been
a number of bills before this
body.
That we're trying to address
the.
Albuquerque PNM.
Our shortage this has been.
Publicized in the last of.
couple weeks.
The bill the issue.
Is I think pretty significant.
And.
I think the only real six.
To the issue is.
For the short term.
Is to utilize.
The power of the generated at St
Lujan.
For.
A couple years.
And on top of that to add
natural gas back to the.
Renewable portfolio.
Utilizing.
The most advanced technology.
That allows it to be highly
efficient.
Mr speaker I shared with you
and.
The Majority Leader.
And the governor's office
earlier today.
A poll that.
Was run in Albuquerque over the
weekend.
And I want to share with the
body of by my.
Because I think for the
significant is.
There's not a signet there's not
a real difference between
Republicans and Democrats and
independents.
As you go through the policy
it's.
Almost the same and but in most
of the categories.
The first question was about
over the.
S. T. in the over the past year
have you experienced an increase
in gasoline prices in your
communities.
It was eighty eight eighty six
eighty nine percent.
Are you concerned about rising
electricity and gas utility
rates again seventy nine seventy
six seventy eight.
Have you.
The increased.
Cost of fuel natural gas
electricity made you concerned
about your family's ability to
afford these necessities.
Again fifty five.
Fifty four.
Forty six.
Then there was according to the
Albuquerque journal The New
Mexico's.
Utility PNM is expecting.
Rolling electricity blackouts
this summer.
Do you think that the immediate
do you think that immediate
action should be taken by the
governor.
And the state legislature.
To avoid these.
Possible electrical blackouts.
Thank you.
Sixty nine.
Sixty seven.
Seventy six.
There was.
There is a plan to avoid the
predicted summer power blackouts
keep electricity and gas utility
rates affordable.
And save jobs do you think this
plan should be considered by the
governor and the state
legislature.
Once again.
Sixty seven sixty eight.
In eighty one.
The last question was.
In order to address climate
change.
Do you believe that New Mexicans
should pay substantially more
for gasoline natural gas and
electricity to meet the
governor's environmental
standards.
Once again Mr speaker.
The numbers were.
Seventy eight seventy two and
eighty.
Every one of these polls without
regard.
To political affiliation.
Or declined the state.
I think in all of them.
They were with them.
Seven or eight points of each
other.
I know there are plans for.
I know there are.
Others trying to concoct.
A short term fix to this
problem.
But.
Mr speaker I think if we leave
here.
And don't.
Try to address this issue.
We are.
Negligent.
And some would say will fully.
Because we know better.
Mr speaker I
I know this morning we had it
and I appreciated your.
Your help in getting this bill.
Pardon Commerce I appreciated.
The chairman's.
The bay.
And.
And I have no complaint about
that.
I think it's a big enough issue
that it should come to the body.
In the body should have the
opportunity.
To address the issue.
So.
To Mr speaker with that being
said.
I move the house bill.
Two twenty is withdrawn from
commerce and economic
development.
And made the next order of
business.
And Mister speaker I'd like a
roll call the roll call.
The motion is proper.
The motion is to remove House
Bill to twenty from the
committee on commerce and
economic development and make it
the next order of business is
there debate.
Hearing none pose a phase in
roll call.
Two twenty Mr speaker.
I was hoping to be today just a
little bit I also want to
clarify that was a.
energy and commerce committee
substitute for House Bill to
twenty I don't know if you need
that clarification on it it
doesn't matter for this purpose
some
speaker I'd like to have a I'd
like to ask for a call in the
house.
Mr speaker.
Who is talking
gentlelady from Bernalillo.
Mr speaker and and
Gentleman from San Juan is it up
loaded on the website the proper
version of it yes thank you.
For members that are physically
in the chamber please go to your
seats until the call is
completely.
Yes it was directed to you
Representative Hernandez.
Please go to your seat.
They're there to members first
we're waiting on.
Members please state your seats
into the calls complete.
Everyone everyone let's let's
let's let the sergeants do their
jobs they got the checklists
they're seeing who is on soon
who's physically present.
So they're perfectly capable of
doing the job so let's just let
them do it the latest known the
calls complete.
Members the sergeant at arms has
informed me that the call is
complete.
Gentleman from Chavis Eddie and
Tero.
with the calls complete the
gentleman for San Juan
Representative Rod Montoya
wishes to debate.
Thank you Mr speaker this
gentleman from Chavis Eddy and
Otero you'll be happy to.
Thank you Mr speaker gentleman.
I and it's gonna be hard to to
have this discussion of things
that we cannot debate the merits
of the bill.
but if I may ask you it pulling
it out and and doing this
external extraordinary.
Effort as we've been told
earlier it has to be really good
reason for it if you have a to
have a really good reason for
this move this evening Mr
speaker and gentleman.
Mr speaker and gentleman
I believe that it has much to do
with the health and welfare of
our state.
I believe that it has been.
And now.
In verified by.
The provider.
And I just don't think we have
any choice we have to address
the issue if there's another
issue out there that will fix
the problem.
I'm all I'm I'm game I just
think the issue needs to be
addressed.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman
In in doing this does is help
your area.
Mr speaker and gentleman is this
something you doing for your
area.
Mr speaker and gentleman of the
service area I think this
predominantly.
Albuquerque and Santa Fe and
surrounding greater area but
those are the two large
population basically.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
Is there a time constraint or
any reason based on.
The in that nature of of your
bill is there any any time
constraint that is that we're up
against.
Speaker and gentleman of since
I've started investigating this
I became aware that
Our options were at least based
on what I know today are very
limited if we don't.
Free at pretty quick.
The power plant in question.
is in shut down mode and then
the mining is being
shut down those people are
being.
laid off as we speak I think
that I think it's right now.
and so.
Want to disassemble all of that.
It leave it is you know trying
to reach out and in that back up
is it is very difficult so
that's the reason I'm Pushin
that's hard as I am is because I
just don't believe we haven't
much time to waste.
So Mister speaker and gentleman
because of that that time
constraint I've I've heard that.
Maybe the governor instead of
this bill that maybe the
governor could do some
unilaterally and maybe an
executive order but if it
doesn't happen within literally
the next several days.
The problem that you're
discussing will hit this year in
Albuquerque and Santa Fe is that
correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman it's my
understanding.
That
there might be
provisions within within the ETA
for the governor.
To make a.
Maybe an executive order.
On one of those issues but it
doesn't cover both of them and
you're not going to solve the
long term problems based on many
conversations that I've had with
many people in the power
generating business they tell me
that PNM has been correct.
That Albuquerque and Santa Fe
most likely.
We'll have.
Rolling blackouts and brownouts
if this is not addressed the
lady from Santa Fe for purpose
to rise all right so just to
clarify for the body about the
motion that was made.
Mr speaker
reasons rural section for ninety
one about withdrawing this
proposal from the committee
makes it very clear that to be
in such cases must must be
confined strictly to the purpose
of the motion for this is not
true the merits of any proposal
could be endorsed under
discussion merely by such a
motion to withdraw their for the
discussion maybe must only be
confined to the motion made not
the contents of the legislation
or the proposal.
Thank you Mr.
Thank you Mr.
Speaker I think she is correct
I'm not going to argue that
point.
But I would tell the body.
Is we better rise above masons
and start addressing the issues
before Albuquerque of right now.
this we're going to continue to
follow the rules at it which we
have done that your insistence
numerous times throughout the
session we are happy to
recognize your motion is
properly made we're happy to
work to complete the call we're
happy to follow the rules if you
ask us to follow the rules I
think it's fair for me to ask
the same of you to stick to not
discussing the merits or the
contents of legislation to stick
to the resistance to the
Just to the motion and so we
we've given you guys both a
little bit of leeway but if we
can get back.
to the rule for masons of the
generally for Santa Fe is just
read
certainly appreciate it they
will stay within the rules point
taken Mr speaker I agree.
Missing this gentleman yield.
We have.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman.
So I I know you did take
extraordinary steps
Throughout this session.
To try and to the issue that is
at hand and your bill.
but.
I know that your your move today
Mr speaker as you explained it
to me gentleman from Chavis at
you know terrible is because of
the urgent nature.
What is facing us and that.
throughout the session you've
been trying to.
raise this issue as it and the
level of importance and urgency
that it actually is and so
even introduce again at a later
date and that I do appreciate
the speaker entertaining the
conversation the last couple of
days over allowing us to
introduce this because of the
urgent nature and I just
appreciate you bring it before
the the body today.
in this way so that everyone
would have a chance rather than
just the the the one committee.
That everyone especially in the
affected areas would have a
chance to vote on this so I I
support you in your effort to
withdraw this from committee and
I. R. to the body to support
your efforts to make this the
next order of business thank you
Mr speaker.
Okay the motion before the body
is to withdraw house bill two
twenty from committee and make
it the next order of business
roll call vote has been
requested.

time this evening to address

an issue that we will have to

Albuquerque and probably Santa
Fe will wonder why in the world
we didn't.
Egolf I would hope.
And I would encourage
issues thanks for the.
Poll that was taken was tainted.

The gentleman from Lee

the gentle lady's.
tax packages goes forward.
I have to thank you very much
miss speaker and gentleman for
bringing this forward we spoke
about these priorities as part
of the budget debate when we had
our alternative budget.
And I really believe that.
These things that are in this
legislation.
Well not just.
You know perhaps thank some
people and help those people
need help.
But also.
Take care of some significant
challenges that we face in the
state in our tax code and.
This these changes these reform
reforms are desperately needed
Mr chairman when I talk with
people about taxes.
you know all often joked that
to.
You know I started losing over
half and you know it's not that
interesting and people start
going to sleep in and I'm of
course very animated about it
and I single Mr chairman that
the reason that I feel so
passionately and I've really
dedicated thousands of hours of
my life trying understand our
tax code and how we can improve
it.
Because at the core.
If we have.
The tax code.
That.
Doesn't.
Prevent someone from taking a
risk and trying out a new idea
that doesn't make it hard for a
business to expand or grow your
FIR doesn't immediately chase
away businesses that are maybe
looking for somewhere else to
set up shop.
For Tesco doesn't do those
things.
We have an economy.
Where people can get good jobs.
And what happens when you have
good jobs Senator John and you
have a moment to add.
We can.
At home with their kids during
dinner time.
You can take them to Kharadi or
soccer or beyond.
And are not having to worry
about we're going to different
jobs
to put food on the table and
senator John and they're there
to help them with their homework
and make sure that they're doing
those things that they need to
be doing and they're not perhaps
Are running about with.
Capsules addition could be bad
influences Mr chairman I really
firmly believe that having a
good tax code.
Is actually a solution to many
of our social ills that we
experience here in the state of
New Mexico.
Miss Vigil and maybe you know
maybe maybe that's a a a you
know a bit too far for some
folks but I really truly believe
that that if we have great jobs.
Mr Chairman we're not gonna
worry so much about Medicaid
match because you have so few
people on Medicaid because
they'll have jobs where they
have benefits.
is Mr chairman I I just want to
commend you and thank you
because these things that are
present in this bill and I'm I'm
hopeful that we'll have this
with some of these happen next
year.
But I'm I'm just trying to get
Frustrated cynical because I've
heard for many many many years
in a row now that.
Good job Representative Harper
you know you're these are great
ideas we're gonna do those next
year.
And I've heard that so many
times in a row that.
I'm trying not to be.
pessimistic about what could
potentially be something great
happening next year
there was a gentleman I agree
with you that this really is a
lost opportunity because.
We can do it now.
And we should do it now.
Mr speaker and gentleman I hi
rise in in support.
And thank you for bringing this
forward.
There is additional debate the
gentle lady from Los Alamos.
Rio Arriba Sandoval in Santa Fe
with the gentleman from Lee
County yields.
To the need for Los Alamos.

speaker and gentleman.
Of these items gentleman were
vetted through the tax
committee.
Speaker gentle lady.
Receipts tax reform.
Has been forwarded to the tax
committee.
For that appears that I have
been here.
And madam speaker gentle lady.
Everyone.
Please that significant reform
is an absolute necessity to
bring our tax code compliance
with competing neighbors.
Madam speaker gentle.
Well
when we try to introduce change
reform.
To ensure to.
What is the excuse.
Madam speaker and gentle lady is
experiences we just don't have
the money.
Sure we do.
The money thank you madam
speaker.
Madam speaker and gentleman and
what revenue sources besides the
ones you've listed.
Will replace what I believe was
about a four hundred million
dollar hit for this point I T.
R. T. reduction and could you
identify which of those sources
are recurring that will be able
to stand so staying this point I
T. R. T. reduction.
Into the future.
Many of these oral correct and
madam speaker and gentle lady
what we are penalty goal.
This these tax reductions.
And the General reform.
To improve the economic activity
in the state to where this cuts.
On on to Puri they're not
they're not.
Develop.
Taken aback.
They're developed so that they
will be.
And significant cuts to taxes to
to our citizens.
And madam speaker and gentleman
we're supposed to trust that
this theory will sustain us we
don't have any data suggests
that madam speaker gentleman's
you believe that by cutting
taxes but the G. R. T. by point
five percent that's just a half
a percent the economy is going
to grow at such a rate that we
will need to support Medicaid
madam speaker in that month we
don't we won't need any of these
other programs to support schism
because the economy will be
booming and we will be in
economics saying realize that
what you're telling us madam
speaker and gentleman firmly.
Madam speaker gentle lady I
managed were changed law but I
do trust the citizens of this
state.
Appropriate opportunity.
I will go to work conforms to
taxes due state does not have to
function Madam speaker and
gentleman that's a great police
but when we have data then we I
think we can act but there's
been no data madam speaker and
gentleman this idea was not
truly vetted in the committee I
would point out madam speaker
that the tax package that we
presented was vetted Madam
speaker and indeed had
bipartisan support and madam
speaker and gentleman I very
much appreciate your kind words
at the beginning of your
discussion where you pointed out
that it was a very good process
and the bill was vetted fairly
and thoroughly thank you madam
speaker and I'm not done but
thank you now as to the
Montoya.
Exams in the three thousand
Madam speaker did we hear that
bill or any bill similar bill in
our committee Madam speaker and
gentleman.
Madam speaker gentle lady I
believe we have session.
Okay well madam speaker and
gentleman we do agree that we
are legislating for this year.
Madam speaker gentle lady yes I
would agree with that.
Members of the body and
gentleman from Madam speaker and
gentleman from Lee.
At the tax package that we are
presenting to you.
Is of the product of.
a whole session of hearings
debates and votes.
This package has had virtually
no discussion within our
committee except for.
The social security tax which we
did include madam speaker and
gentleman in our package with
some modification after we
evaluated the fiscal impact.
We we determined that an
absolute exemption.
Was we could not afford and was
not proven and we voted on that
package today Madam speaker and
gentleman.
We did discuss anti pyramid
building and had a very good
conversation about that point
and the the gentleman from Santa
was very helpful in sharing his
perspective on that what we
ultimately did now speaker and
gentleman was to include a small
piece of pyramid building where
we remove Sarah manning in an
effort to advance manufacturing
in the state so G. R. T. for
services for manufacturing will
no longer be taxed at that
interim state
I'm very pleased and proud of
how the committee worked packets
there was a lot of consensus
Madam speaker and gentleman I
think you would agree with that
and I would urge the body to
support the bill that the
committee work so hard on during
this session Madam speaker and
gentleman.
There is further debate
Representative.
Representative from Chavis Lee
and Roosevelt.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentleman yield.
When would you.
Gentleman from Travis Lee
Roosevelt.
Of the gentleman did I
understand correctly that the
pyramid in concept on
professional services was not.
Considered.
By the tax committee this year
question.
Through the internet in
consequences for over a small
portion of the tax package
includes public manufacturing
only in the original tax
package.
Thank you chairman then it's my
understanding that to me
important exclusion.
Because I think New Mexico
professionals reported that
disadvantage adding that tax
gross receipts tax so if one
says gentleman Mr speaker.
If one says.
What's the impact.
Of that was there ever any
calculation of how many dollars
we might be talking about.
Question.
Speaker and gentleman with
respect to.
This.
Provisions will cost to the
state one hundred and ten
million dollars.
I see and madam speaker
gentleman does that include the
manufacturing component and the
other components in the
substitute we're considering
question.
Mr speaker and gentleman the
manufacturing component is
included one hundred nineteen.
Thank you very much for that
gentleman of I heard the Madam
speaker comment about four
hundred million dollars being
of.
The tax cut.
Tax package could.
The number you it did I
understand that correctly gentle
with Madam speaker.
Madam speaker and gentleman the
original tax package that is
approximately correct.
Thank you gentleman the
gentleman I only have one final
point madam speaker on this for
substitute which I think does
carry important of permitting.
Of.
If this continues the permitting
of professional services which I
believe is very important
however I did want to move on to
another component of your house
for substitute and that is the
veteran income.
That turned retirement income.
Exemption was there a fiscal
impact reported for that.
Of them if the bill passes Madam
speaker gentle.
Madam speaker and gentleman with
respect to this floor amendment
the fiscal impact is only
seventeen point three million
dollars for the military
retirement thanks.
And.
Therefore gentleman madam
speaker my calculation would be
that that exemption alone as a
component to four hundred
million is less than five
percent is that correct.
Miss madam speaker excuse me and
gentleman it's personal number.
Thank you very much for that
will I stand to support your for
substitute and I'm most
interested in the inclusion of
the anti pyramid the gross
receipts tax that has long been
debated without action I further
support as.
I believe the veterans.
Income tax.
Federal retirement income tax
exemption is a no other very
important concept AOC it.
Is a way of New Mexico has a
large one of those states in the
country.
Madam chair gentleman with
Representative veterans in our
population and I believe of a
cut is your proposing would
would help that of.
Growth along as we had a decade
where we didn't have any madam
speaker gentleman's thank you.
There's further debate the
gentle lady from caption Sapporo
and Balentien counties.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentleman from Lee yield.
To the gentle lady.
Thank you gentlemen thank you
madam speaker I was very excited
madam speaker and kind and went
to see the elimination of New
Mexico income tax on social
security benefits.
From as many of the people in
this body know that time myself
and other of of my colleagues
have carried this legislation
for many years.
And madam speaker kind gentleman
it's always been said we can't
afford it it's gone from the
estimate of eighty four million
two hundred and eighteen
million.
I don't know why it would have
grown from eighty four million
last year two hundred and twelve
or a hundred eighteen million
this year if but madam speaker
and kind gentleman
do you believe that our retirees
here in New Mexico deserve a
break on their social security
tax income and do you believe
Madam speaker kind gentleman
that might attract retirees here
to the land of enchantment.
Madam speaker gentle lady I
would have to answer in the
affirmative to both of those
questions one of the very few
states that tax social security
benefits and it does.
It will make a difference to
return looking for a place to
come to spend their golden
years.
Thank you kind Sir and thank you
madam speaker I just received an
email tonight kind gentleman
that said I will not move to New
Mexico.
And less this tax is taken off
of miss madam speaker kind
gentleman the the lady said that
she would love to live move to
New Mexico to be with her
grandchildren but refuses to
unless we are off of the list.
Madam speaker kind gentleman
for retirees the realist the
retirees look at and we're off
we're going to be on that list
if we don't fully exempt are
retirees so I stand and support
thank you madam speaker and kind
gentleman.
There is been a request for
gentleman to remove their
jackets seeing no objections
members made use of.
Representative the
representative from Bernalillo
county Representative Rehm.
Thank you madam speaker will the
general fund from blue.
Yield well the gentleman from
Bernalillo.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
Wendy I want to talk about the
emails that I've received I see
recieved a lot of the emails
requesting the social security
tax be removed and I mean we we
get emails from outside our
district but even in my
district.
I received a lot of the mails
requesting the same thing.
I spoke and other members and
they have said the same I was
wondering if this is for in
response to the emails you've
received.
Not only.
Testimony on the term social
security bills we had come
through tax sure.
Well as significant response on
both of those bills from people
supporting those initiatives.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
Lee.
Also have you heard.
The state state what we want to
do is become more friendly to
retirees and that way they'll
come here.
Mr speaker and gentleman on.
All.
Or
and gentleman from Lee.
Let's go to the military
retirement have you received a
lot of E. mails and
communications requesting the
the read military retirees
receive some tax break here in
New Mexico.
Mr speaker and gentleman once
again I have to answer that
question.
Thanks for the popular proposal.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
blue have you have communication
from that I mean a lot of people
not just a few a lot of people
saying that if we were more
friendly to retirees
Representative military retirees
that they would move here.
Sessions or.
That is rolled over over.
In the charter in the
legislature.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
Lee I.
I see this as an opportunity to
attract retirees both social
security and of the military
retirees to New Mexico and
increase our population when we
had a.
Two percent of the population
growth over the last two years I
think we've got to do something
different.
To start giving more retirees
here or more people into our
state.
And I just stand in strong
support of this
hi in fact had signed on to some
of this legislation because
there were so many
communications out of my
district thank you madam speaker
and gentleman from Lee.
The gentleman from San Juan
Representative Strickler thank
you.
Thank you madam speaker with the
gentleman from late please
yield.
To the change Forand from San
Juan thank you gentleman
you're looking at your list you
know all these all these
Tax reductions have been
discussed many times in the
past.
for example the G. R. T. rate
reduction.
That that's been kicked around
For a long time in which you
simply done you just double that
from the current recommendation
of a two hundred point two five
EVD simply doublet to half half
percent so that's that's pretty
easy math there.
Madam speaker.
That is exactly correct and
alone right the provision for
the tax code can be resented in
the event that.
Revenues declined.
Good point madam madam speaker
and and jealous a very good
point so this this is a real cut
and currently madam speaker and
gentleman from Lee
no our country we're we're
pushing eight a half percent in
G. R. T. and that's getting
pretty high and we're we're now
higher than our neighbors and
Colorado and that's you know we
we want to be competitive were
trade area in Farmington San
Juan County
with the retail
we've got a lot of retail
establishments home depot Lowe's
the targets sams Walmart success
we get a lot out of town you
know business from the
surrounding states so we we had
to be higher than than Durango
goes so madam speaker
gentleman's that that's a that's
a good change but moving that
triggers even better and then
the source can benefits we this
inside is been around a long
time and we now know that Texas
doesn't tax social care benefits
say they have no income tax we
all know that there are big
competitor the state and
Colorado in to a excuse me
Colorado and there's no longer
tax so security benefits is that
is that your understanding Madam
speaker and gentleman from Lee.
Speaker of the speaker of the
New Jersey have to take your
word for those because I can't
speak to all of those stories
return to command but I take my
word for that sets that's the
facts that
Shares is excuse me the Colorado
winners on no longer tax any
portion of so scary and and and
the latest development issue to
all has now
done some reduction of their
taxes and remember madam speaker
and gentleman firmly those
surrounding states have a lower
top income tax rate than we have
so we want to be competitive
initial Mike is competitive by
eliminating also security tag
on the personal income tax some
saw security which is a hundred
eighteen million dollars of the
cost item and I'm just going to
listen anti permitting.
We.
Mexico lags behind our neighbors
and and and and the competitive
situation and Senator committee
is a game changer for the state
of New Mexico it is a cost of
hundred nineteen million dollars
Los station charge gross
receipts tax on services we do
and that's a real that's a real
head on our economy and madam
speaker and gentleman.
Mexico had a very slow growth
way that two point eight percent
in population growth all over
surrounding states Texas
Colorado Utah owners on have
enjoyed a twelve to fourteen
percent population growth and
Colorado picked up a
congressional seat in Texas
picked up to the Gristle seats
and so we need to company when
when a good folks to move and
our state and so the top rating
again we talked about a long
time it's been vetted thoroughly
it has a price tag of hundred
nineteen million which I think
is reasonable you mentioned
earlier gentleman Madam speaker
and gentleman from les the
retirement we have the partial
exclusion military retirement
benefits gentleman that he and I
don't know if you remember but
and and two thousand fifteen
passed the Senate passed a
similar bill in the house
committees passed a similar bill
and it unfortunately not only
house for two thousand fifteen
so this is going thoroughly
vetted in the past and a
seventeen million dollar
hit to the budget is pretty
reasonable.
General Uh in in at last thing I
realize is your hundred is here
one time Mr speaker and
gentleman firmly the one time
tax rebate is hundred dollars of
Vigil HL sold with income it's
in it's it's targeted for income
less than a hundred thousand
dollars and it's a shot in the
arm for family for that four
hundred forty dollars for each
family for family for in just
one time is that is that correct
gentleman.
Madam speaker gentleman from San
Juan that is correct it is a one
time rebate rather than.
Going.
So rest during so that's that's
that's one time Madam speaker
and gentleman for the if you
have a plan to pay for this this
additional tax cuts by cutting
four hundred million dollars in
expenditures to help balance the
books and and I believe you
mentioned those the.
Twenty five million dollars from
the general fund from done spend
funds from the economic
development department.
It to the DFA also hundred
twenty five million dollars for
the hydrogen a fifty million
dollars for the venture capital
fund seven million dollars for
the economic development
department three and a half
million dollars for the the
waste water treatment facility
for the Santa Fe opera house it
could probably delayed and then
ten million dollars of of.
For census of New Mexico
residents who do not qualify for
other federal aid payments and
then seventy million dollars for
new executive billing that can
be delayed so I've got a good
you've got a good plan to help
pay for this is that is that is
that was that you're going
gentleman from lane Madam
speaker madam chair John one is
we're all.
The budget has to balance Seoul
international four hundred
dollars of cuts to come from.
Used programs one of the.
Provisions of.
Senator turned all the
provisions in the bill what a
the.
Revenue.
What's that were made in house
bill two.
In in challenge for the you know
the so the.
He's.
The.
Money back to the people and I
know the the the the the
packages being presented now
does does as well it's around
four hundred million three
hundred seventy maybe seventy
million dollars
someone that ballpark in this
this goes of the to a hundred
million and
thank you now with the with high
inflation Madam speaker and
gentleman from only.
we you know for working folks
are you know they're there.
Their dollars are shrinking.
Of inflation is is a problem
seven seven half percent
everybody sees of the gasoline
and and then gasoline
thank you you totally bills and
and food costs because of the
supply chains rely so heavily on
on transportation costs fuel
costs and so this is just a step
in the right direction
especially with with with our
revenue revenues being as good
as it's ever been
but I've never you know we would
never ever
put a budget together they say
they have a point four billion
dollars that's that's a lot it's
a it's a big budget for small
state so Mister speaker Madam
speaker and gentle family the
really appreciate your your your
thoughtfulness on this and I
think it it really demonstrates
said that we're willing to give
some of these some of these
extra revenues back to the
people in New Mexico it's a good
deal thank you madam speaker
thank you gentleman.
The other gentleman from San
Juan Representative Montoya
thank you madam speaker this
gentleman from Lee you.
Gentleman from San Juan.
Thank you speaker and gentleman.
It was asked of you earlier if.
these concepts have been vetted
in tax committee this year
and I know that some of them
have been vetted this year in in
committee but madam speaker and
and gentleman I like to have
been serving on the tax
committee for eight years.
since I even I came in as
freshmen together and have been
serving and learning about taxes
during that time.
And madam speaker and and and
gentleman have we've had
Conversations about.
A complete overhaul.
Of our tax system.
As a matter of fact and speaker
and and and and gentleman
I believe that Representative
Harper and
And and gentleman who who worked
here in leader's office
Ryan Gleason actually put
together entire.
Package based on some
assumptions that we had some
thoughts that we had and ran it
through an entire process.
And vetted and.
We were able to come in and
show.
What would happen if we did make
certain changes and really
looked Madam speaker and
gentleman at
A complete overhaul of our tax
is trying to become more
competitive with our neighbors
trying to be more fair with the
entire populace instead of
picking and choosing losers and
winners.
And
Madam speaker and gentleman we
were able to get out of the
house but it died because they
said well that.
was not a really really good
look into to our taxes.
we need to have a third party do
it.
And so we actually paid for a
third party to go out and do the
exact same thing so that we
would understand these concepts
madam speaker and how.
They would apply if we were to
take these concepts and when
they did it when we actually had
a national firm.
Go and do a full review of our
taxes they came up with
literally.
within inches.
Of what Representative Harper.
And and Ryan Gleason are of who
worked in the in the majority
leader's office that time.
It was almost exactly the same.
So madam speaker and gentleman.
A lot of these concepts that are
being discussed today we've
vetted we've vetted thoroughly
we've added up for years.
Would you agree with that Mr
speaker R. G. and gentleman.
A former coal number of children
from Santa may be able to
correct.
But this was one of the most
important for purposes of
reform legislation I believe
I've ever seen formal listings
house bill four twirls.
You'll
for June one tax reform.
This will for sure to to.
With the J. or G. reform
components that are.
Find for June one tax reform.
Rather than relying on
government to grow more
prosperity.
What we do is allow for private
citizens of New Mexico.
To grow or press for the.
It is.
More established was
disagreement the this was the
one place in our tax code to
support limited the most help.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentlemen so the G. R. T. rate
reduction.
Of half a percent.
In in your substitute.
That is really a far cry from
what we've looked at in the past
and was vetted in the past.
But madam speaker and and
gentleman.
It was suggested earlier that.
That these ideas have not been
vetted and that.
That money would not flow back
in with these tax credits so
madam speaker and gentleman I
remember.
Over the last several years we
have made.
Very similar.
Tax reductions
and for rate increase tax
credits.
For the litter program and the
working families tax credit.
And madam speaker and gentleman
I I believe the discussion we
had.
Over that was that.
If these people if these folks
have the money in their pocket.
These dollars.
It for these families who.
Who are in need of this money
will then spend.
And I'm I'm assuming now that.
What the reason that that that
we're not wanting to use the
same type of thinking on this is
that if people
Madam speaker gentle if they get
these tax breaks that you're
suggesting here in your
substitute that they would sort
of say that they would not spend
it I mean Madam speaker and
gentleman we're talking about.
The G. R. T. tax break we're
talking about so people who are
on social security retirement.
is is there some reason to
believe madam speaker and
gentleman that.
Of the folks who retired in a
living on social security.
Our living high on the hog and
they cannot or do not need that
extra money to purchase assesses
and then speaker and gentleman
especially with the inflation.
That we're seeing
I believe and I and and correct
me if I'm wrong but I believe.
That these the folks that we're
talking about here.
Just like the families who are
receiving the tax credit for
elector and working families on
those tax credits.
That these reductions as well.
Retirees.
Likely would use that to make
sure that they're able to assist
to provide for their expenses
and and madam speaker and
gentleman as the as the.
leader the minority leader when
he was going over these.
The rising.
The cost for fuel for gasoline
for utilities.
That.
This money will be spent.
If we allow the people who are.
Who have worked and paid taxes
for years if we were to give
that back to is that your belief
madam speaker and gentleman.
Engine one.
This is what I would call the
demand side element of this
package.
Thank you of madam speaker and
gentleman.
As far as the pure omitting the
tax payer omitting.
In the end.
Madam speaker and gentleman who
pays the cost.
For all of this taxiing from
entity to entity to entity to
finally the consumer Madam
speaker and gentleman.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
Ultimately it's a concern.
The chain.
Our records for small business
owners and outside services
helps.
Instances of have to charge
gross receipts tax prior to
moving to the end user.
Thank you madam speaker and and
gentleman I believe that is an
argument that that certain
members of this body.
Pay attention to that how it
harms business along the way.
But the end user the consumer.
The person who's buying the
product at the end.
Hi I've been I heard in
committee for years about.
That person especially in New
Mexico.
As many people we have who are
living on some sort of
government subsidy.
Who are living below the poverty
level madam speaker and
gentleman that's what hurts the
most.
I I do believe it hurts business
along the way but who does it
hurt the most madam speaker and
gentleman.
Gentleman usher of total.
It's
call to tax rates for the
consumer.
Insurance circumstances as well
as a double digits fifteen
twenty percent.
That raises everybody's.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman have my final question
is is about the
So before I get to my final
question on the back up just a
bit.
I do believe that there was an
there is some provisions in the
current the tax bill that you're
looking to substitute.
the chairwoman of taxes The of
tax.
In her bill there is a G. R. T.
reduction of two point five
percent.
Four point two five percent.
And madam speaker and gentleman.
That is about a small as you can
go.
The any consequence at all.
madam speaker and gentleman.
That point two five percent even
as small as it is there's a
there's a
Trigger to end it.
An automatic trigger.
And madam speaker and gentleman
concern I have on that trigger
is.
That it really it takes it out
of our hands.
If we were just to put in place
this gross receipts tax.
reduction.
In February.
The the calculation would be
made as to whether or not we
bar losing.
Money on that and that speaker
Jim that would happen in
February in power in session.
And it would automatically
revert back to the old number.
So madam speaker and and
gentleman if we're going to be
in session because that would
happen in February in every
thirty day session every day
said every sixty day session we
will be here in February.
So madam speaker and gentleman I
don't understand why we would
not make that permanent.
Because we would be here to
corrected if we found that there
were a problem we could
increases domestic agenda that's
hard to do that.
So rather than do that and
rather than hinder our ability
to spend money for other
priorities and to give tax
breaks that are very specific to
certain groups.
Instead of giving that that
would be to every New Mexicans
to every person who purchases
drugs in New Mexico so madam
speaker and gentleman I think
that's the real problem I have
with our tax code in general as
we we pick winners and losers
far too often and we don't go
after something like the gross
receipts tax credit.
And vertex and given a credit
there or reduce their.
That would help every single
family.
Instead of targeting the few and
and most of our if you look at
Representative Harper talk calls
because of the Swiss cheese.
Harper will be gone a hundred
years from here will be with
them and members of this body
are going to be talking about
the Swiss cheese of New Mexico
tax policy because we come in
here and even when we have the
kind of surplus that we have.
We can take the boldest move we
can make as a point two five
percent.
decreased to to
to to gross receipts and then we
put in a reversion provision.
And then Madam speaker and
gentleman.
There is a social security
benefits
the.
Credit or deduction.
For in in the name bill.
Once again it doesn't go all the
way.
So we will remain Madam speaker
and gentleman on my outside of
your substitute.
We will remain one of the twelve
states.
That still charges taxes on
social security to some degree
is that correct Madam speaker
John madam speaker gentleman
that is accurate.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman so now I am to the
final point which is on your
military retirement speaker and
gentleman has that been
discussed before.
Junior sedans.
And madam speaker and gentleman
whenever we have that
discussion.
Do we always.
Get to that point the session
and say well maybe we can look
at this and maybe next year.
And maybe when hell freezes
over.
Mr speaker and gentleman I'm
afraid that's where we've gotten
to we we really are not willing
to give people back portion of
their money and that speaker and
gentleman especially in this
case we're talking about.
Our military our folks have gone
out there put themselves in
harm's way for us.
I just don't see a better way to
say thank you then to start to
chip away at what our veterans
are folks that have worked who
have served in the military
have.
And who have who have done that
in our place.
That we can in some way give.
This this is not this is a half
measures well this doesn't go
all the way.
But it starts the discussion and
it starts the effort to start to
think our military.
And our veterans for what
they've done for us so madam
speaker and gentleman I I look
to support your your
Your substitute can I ask yeah I
don't know if there is any of
those points that I've made if
you want to respond to but now
speaker and gentleman that
appreciate your effort and I
would hope that the body give it
serious consideration.
There's further debate the
gentle lady from Dona Ana
Representative Cadena thank you
madam speaker does the gentleman
from the county of.
The gentle lady.
Thank you madam speaker my
colleague on the house tax
committee I've got to sit down
for a couple of minutes and we
do this for substitutes so I
appreciated the extensive
dialogue we've had all session
as we carefully crafted house
bill one sixty three but I do
have a couple of questions on
the substitute.
Madam madam speaker gentleman
when I look at section one.
It looks to me like this is
regressive tax policy Madam
speaker gentleman it looks to me
like no matter how much personal
income someone has that we'd be
offering the same dollar amount
in the form of an income tax
rebate is that accurate madam
speaker and gentleman.
Speaker gentle lady I'm not
quite sure I understand.
Question.
Is it or you Representative tax.
Date is regressive.
Madam speaker gentleman what I'd
be
Articulating is that a tax
policy would be considered
regressive to me if no matter
how much a filer or family earns
that they would be given the
same credit or rebate
when the when they were filing.
Well as for come levels plus two
hundred thousand dollars.
Madam speaker gentleman I don't
see that here in your for sub.
Madam speaker Johnson can you
point me to that language.
Once.
For those rooms to.
Raul.
I can less than one hundred
thousand dollars it doesn't
appear to be built.
Thank you madam speaker
gentlemen I appreciate the
intention and we all know
sometimes at the late hour
things don't go as we exactly
planned moving to section two
madam speaker gentleman we
certainly had a vigorous debate
in the house tax committee as it
related to social security tax
and repeal I can't remember in
which audiences I've articulated
my concerns with the straight
repeal but I'd like to confirm
here madam speaker gentleman the
repeal in your floor sub is not
a graduated income based repeal
it's a complete repeal of the
social security income tax would
that be accurate madam speaker
gentleman Madam speaker gentle
lady that is correct.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman this issue is
something I've thought of
extensively I've had actually a
couple of conversations with my
mom who is a retiree that taught
for thirty years in New Mexico's
elementary and classrooms and
now lives off of her ERP
retirement social security and
as someone that had the fortune
of blessing and privilege of of
that kind of consistent
employment over years she's also
reminded me even I pay that and
then she's followed up madam
speaker gentleman to say but I
can probably afford to give a
little and I'm grateful that for
folks like me that have a bit of
our breathing room in our
budgets that we have room to
continue giving back but
certainly madam speaker
gentleman when I thought of of
hard working New Mexicans like
my mom's I know that her income
does not give her a lot of
reading room I think about the
folks that are bringing in high
hi dollars even in their
retirement so certainly madam
speaker and gentleman that is
one concern I have with this
force of is that it's a flat
repeal meaning that we be
eliminating over a hundred
million dollars from New
Mexico's general fund budget and
that we would be treating
taxpayers in New Mexico with the
same flat hands without any
concern for what their income
looks like in retirement.
Plus madam speaker and gentlemen
I've looked over this floor sub
because as you of I you and I
have debated about in house tax
I am looking to see if the child
tax credit maybe into your
floors of I can't seem to find
it madam speaker gentleman might
you point me in that direction.
And Jen Leasure was substituted
for another tax credit.
Madam speaker gentleman what tax
credit took priority over a tax
credit that would go to families
with kids in New Mexico.
Gentlelady
dollars to.
Thanks bye.
Thank you madam speaker
gentleman's so to clarify what
we asked about before that
hundred and ten dollars rebate
would potentially go to every
tax filer it regardless of their
income so we potentially would
be giving that rebate to folks
for you then a lot of money that
probably are not living on
vulnerable edges that probably
have housing stability they
probably know where their next
meal is coming from so madam
speaker gentleman I certainly
have appreciated hearing from
families that are right about
the social security tax but I've
also heard from lots of families
with little ones working to get
by every day so madam speaker
gentleman for those reasons I
cannot support this force of
thank you.
There is continued debate the
gentleman from Dona Ana
Representative small.
We go to thank you madam speaker
the gentleman yield we've
of junk.
Thank thank you madam speaker
thank you gentlemen from the
just a few brief questions first
Madam speaker gentleman from Lee
you mentioned someone proposed
offsets but those Madam speaker
gentleman from the those are in
the budget now that those are
before us today some of the the
pay fors that you outlined is
that accurate madam speaker
gentleman's speaker and
gentleman is exactly correct
House Bill to would have to be
adjusted to accommodate
associate professional four
hundred million dollars that is
proposed to.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentleman firmly that that's
what I understand also for
understood also Madam speaker
gentleman if house bill two is
not adjusted and passed as is
fans speaker gentleman roughly
the the
it's about half of what you're
proposing here is that accurate.
Instagram speaker Jim is actor
okay thank you madam speaker
thank you gentleman although it
I didn't see an FIR fiscal
impact reports for the proposed
for substitute is that so so
what I will take your there
there is no FIR is that correct
madam speaker gentleman's.
Speaker and gentleman that is
active okay but Madam speaker
gentleman I fully
trust what you're saying and so
it's it's about double madam
speaker gentleman's.
If H. B. two is passed as is
signed into law madam speaker
gentleman is this body is passed
at Macy's in concurrence soon
Madam speaker gentleman there's
one thing that kind of worries
me which is
the book you know Madam speaker
gentleman of course the
difference between our operating
reserve and our tax
stabilization reserve madam
speaker gentleman's.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
Source familiar with the
difference between those two
research thank you madam figured
thank you gentlemen so and
roughly all kind of describe it
please disagree if you think
it's an accurate but first madam
speaker gentleman's there's a
lot more money in the tax
stabilization reserve then
operating reserve Madam speaker
gentleman that's in large part
due to some changes that this
body made with former chairman
letter Jaga is since passed on
but left one of his March with
the tax stabilization reserve
the rainy day fund is that's the
part of Mr speaker Madam speaker
gentleman speaker and gentleman
very.
Is one of our rainy day funds
thank you madam figured thank
you gentlemen so to get to the
point briefly on that I
understood the standing madam
speaker gentleman's right now
there's less than a hundred
million dollars in our operating
reserve and what and there's one
point eight billion roughly
madam speaker gentleman's and
the tax stabilization reserve if
H. B. two is passed as is signed
into law essentially without the
cuts that denture outlining
Madam speaker gentleman and
seems to me that we actually
have to dip into the tax
stabilization reserve in order
to pay for the the tax cuts the
spending you outlined in your
for substitute is that.
Madam speaker and gentleman what
has come from somewhere for so
if we don't.
Senator Daschle government
spending is proposed in SB two.
Richer thank you madam speaker
thank you gentlemen so.
Following it from the tax
stabilization reserve while
possible and figure gentleman it
seems to me that that's not
advisable and we should better
to step with the stick within
the framework of madam speaker
gentleman's as we look at this
for substitute it seems fair to
me to soon given what's going on
in the other chamber the
lateness of the hour in the
session that essentially we're
saying there's a high likelihood
of pulling from the tax
stabilization reserve in order
to pay for this for substitutes
madam speaker gentleman's this
the last quick question
Here we heard a lot and and I
have heard to and really respect
hearing from seniors in and out
of state about their desire to
see a a repeal in different ways
for a social security Madam
speaker gentleman that we've
heard that.
My only question their madam
speaker gentleman's have you not
heard from families in New
Mexico with children who would
receive up to a hundred seventy
five dollars per child in their
tax credit.
In support of the.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
Testimony in to the.
Can't recall.
Community rules to that effect
enough thank you madam figured
thank you gentlemen I have heard
from folks back home at sea the
state picking up the child tax
credit that hundreds of up to
have a hundred seventy five
dollars per child as particulate
welcome at this time it's one of
the things madam speaker
gentleman that's most animating
them about the tax reform that
we're looking at the session so
for that plus the tax
stabilization reserve I can't
support the floor substitute
deeply appreciate though your
explanations thank you madam
speaker thank you gentleman.

Or this.
Opportunity.
For some real tax reform.
Over and over again for the.
Here tax reform is always next
year we don't have enough money
let's look at it next year.
Sure we have some.
And we're missing the
opportunity thank you madam
speaker without human.
There is further debate on the
bill Representative the
gentleman from Santa Fe County
Representative Harper.
Thank you madam speaker does the
gentle lady from Los Alamos in
those other counties yield.
Madam speaker and kind gentleman
from Santa I do yield Rio Arriba
Sandoval in Santa Fe.
I'm passionate.
Speaker and gentle lady.
So I want to first again thank
you and for the body here did
thank you in for the committee
today but I want to thank you
for the body.
For the great and fair way that
you ran the committee this year
it was a pleasure working with
you and I appreciate that.
you know the committee process
work right the the will of the
majority of those was what
happened to the concerns the
thoughts of the minority were
taken into account and I think
we came up with.
A pretty good tax package here
one that I think is
always I'm more pleased with the
a couple of the others that have
happened before.
SB urgently so I just want to
thank you for that
and and say that publicly here.
the agency manager we there are
some good things in this bill
that I want to highlight
I have still some more cabinets
but still
We have a gross receipts tax
rate reduction right something
we've been talking about for
years we need to run the basin
or the right well here were
actually willing to right so
that's to be committed as we
usually I think I think the rate
is pretty small.
I've mentioned that I did the
mass and this is going to save
my family six dollars a month so
we're talking about you know a
taken half of gasoline or you
know a couple bad bags of
potatoes right I mean so it's
it's it's not a big change but
as of last a change in the right
direction so as we originally I
commend you for that I do.
one about the trigger.
Was really we talked about that
today in committee my position
is.
This trigger set up that if we
have.
A five percent reduction in G.
R. T. revenues.
The tax rate goes back up.
The administrators only I know
you would say that this is
important it's a protection in
case revenues go down I I I I
get that speaker federally I
hope you understand where I'm
coming from I look at and say
this is going to happen we
always awfully with doing gas
industry so this will happen and
so it's a.
Kind of a.
The way yes to go out and and
say look we we we cut taxes.
What it really was not that
significant.
And it's going to automatically
go back to the way it was
before.
In in a short while so that's
where I'm coming from Mr jelly
but that's still a rate
reduction.
The second thing that I really
like in here.
There is a little bit of anti
permitting on professional
services as we usually there is
for manufacturing services one
of the business the business
transaction those are no longer
be subject to the gross receipts
tax a great staff has been
really we've talked about
permitting and how in some cases
most states to permitting and we
don't need to worry about where
we are like other states where
we just really stand out like a
sore thumb in really hurts
especially small businesses is
our professional services
business to business gross
receipts tax and so I'm pleased
to see this in here it is it is
sadly very narrow.
Of the other ones that we talked
about earlier in committee and
house bill two oh seven really
affect every small business
writer talking about accounting
and bookkeeping services I. T.
services payroll those kinds of
things we can have a great
impact on every single business
in the state itself again I
commend you for including some
anti permitting and I'm hopeful
that next year will be able to
really really take a stab and
I'll remove those from from the
code
and that's really the other
thing I'll highlight which is
really a tax policy is the
definition of the disclosed
agent.
Our agency here.
And I won't go into all the
details of people's eyes glaze
over the minister generally this
clarifies that we don't
committed was gross receipts tax
agents that are simply moving
money between two parties.
And that's really that's.
That's great that's foundational
to the changes we've made the
last two decades and making our
gross receipts tax more like a
broad based retail sales tax so
I am pleased with those three
items in the bill and the Mr
gently.
obviously working with
folks on this side of the oil
one of the things that we
thought would be perhaps go to
include is this what I'm going
to send you to nurses provision
in the in your legislation
speaker gentle lady who were we
are essentially giving persons
that were on rural hospitals and
work more than forty hours a
week a one thousand dollar.
one time tax credit is usually
I surely we deserve a lot more
than that has really gone
through a lot.
But I think this is a a kind
gesture the speaker and gentle
lady to those those folks I
appreciate that being in there
too.
And I've been talking for a lot
I do actually have a couple of
things I want to speak because
of a master usually did you have
at this point anything you'd
like to.
I turned out to be one sided
conversation.
Thank you madam speaker and
thank you kind gentleman
Now I what I do would like to
say that is the focus of the of
our tax package this year was to
try to provide as much tax
relief to as many people as
possible but also taking into
account the cost and Madam
speaker until and maybe we could
review of the little bit while
we're we're discussing this
This item how we go about
thinking about tax policy will
the first order of business is
understanding what our capacity
is how much money has been made
available in our budget for for
tax expenditures and I Madam
speaker and gentleman I know you
know that very well having that
on the tax committee for very
long time and through the
delivered is budget process that
goes on all summer and
culminates in a decision months
later with many of us madam
speaker and gentleman
participating in that process
with the chairwoman presenting
our budget.
That dollar amount was
identified not at eight hundred
million dollars but as you know
gentleman and speaking on
speaker four hundred million
dollars and.
Once we had understand what our
capacity is madam speaker and
gentleman as you know I'm sure
you know we then look at what
makes sense in terms of policy
decisions the committee gets
together and we evaluate what we
what our priorities should be
and what pleases me most about
this package is.
Although the G. R. T. right is
is not as large is perhaps we
might light it is a it is a cut
in every citizen purchaser in
the state budget from businesses
benefit from it and individuals
benefit from Madam speaker and
gentleman.
I'm particularly pleased that we
included the income the child
income tax credit and a speaker
and gentleman because that money
will go directly to families
with children who need some
additional assistance Madam
speaker and gentleman the
federal government had such a
program it was incredibly what
popular it continues to be
popular but Madam speaker
download because of the
dysfunction in Washington they
were unable to renew it and I
I'm very please madam speaker
and gentleman that we took the
initiative as a state and renew
and develop their own income
child income tax policy which is
going to help every family in
the state is not an income based
and Mr speaker and gentleman I
know you and I agree on one
thing and that's the social
security tactics Mexicans
exemption there was a lot of
relaxants on the on the
committee's part but we listened
Madam speaker and gentleman it's
an expensive tax expended
expenditure and we came up with
a compromise bills madam speaker
and you know this Tallman bills
are compromises and we focused
on middle income and lower
income seniors we heard loud and
clear there was a concern that
low income level seniors needed
to pay an extra boost
financially madam speaker and
that's what it does so all in
all I'm extremely proud and I'm
very much enjoyed was working
with you madam speaker into the
gentleman to come up with the
package and I thank you for your
support of the package in
committee I partisan support
Madam speaker and gentleman for
this tax package sorry I
dominated the conversation for
so long Mr speaker.
Management originally from Los
Alamos that's alright you're
just making up most of the time
that I talking dominate the
conversation before some sort of
master Julian I thank you and I
I know to plan to support this
legislation again on the floor.
Mr Julie I thank you for your
comments and and I think this
goes into I'm not to spend much
time talking about this but I I
do think there are perhaps some
things that are this legislation
that we're not.
Perhaps a wide the wise is used
of of money and minister
gentlelady.
but I understand this is part of
the process right this is a
compromise and New York he
mentioned summers or we'd be
compromised earlier but.
you know celery miss a single
building tax credit you know as
we're phasing out the old one
facing in the new one you know
as I I'm not sure exhilarating
that by one year was the wisest
use the funds extending and
increasing the cap of the new
solar market on the tax credit.
Again not sure that was the the
wise use the money there others
if we talk about the rebate on a
speaker gentle lady
I'll probably get in trouble for
saying this because what I
really believe I think rebates
right gimmick.
They're often use right before a
reelection.
Speaker gentle lady and when we
have access dollars.
instead of buying votes with
them we should put them into the
dire needs like roads.
well I really think instead of a
you know quibbling over whether
it goes to a family that you
know is legally you're not
legally here or has a means test
resumes yes Representative
children doesn't have children
everyone uses roads.
Wishes to use that money to help
fix roads
so you know when I look at this
legislation there's a lot to be
proud of but there's a lot of
compromise and and I really feel
that we could have done so much
more with four hundred million
dollars and that's that's an
amazing amount of money for tax
reform
But again all as set aside this
was a very for process contains
a lot of good and bad
And arguably that's the
definition of a tax bill right
where we
there are things that either
side either philosophy like and
dislike in the legislation.
And an investor I just and and
that way from Los Alamos I
would.
I'd probably say you know the
difference in philosophy I'm
seeing here at least in this
legislation I would say.
You know we would like to
empower the people.
but what I see here is perhaps
another foster a few that were
empowering government.
I know mostly gradually you
would disagree I would say no we
are helping those who need the
help the most.
Mr Donnelly all a little later
respond just a moment here but I
would I would come back to that
and say.
If we truly want to help those.
Then we should be teaching
someone how to fish instead of
giving a fresh and another fish
another fish and other fish I
feel like the last three years
we've just been dumping fish on
people Mr generally that but
that's where I'm coming from
philosophically but I'd love to
hear thoughts.
Madam speaker and gentleman that
I think you know we have a lot
of comp great conversations on
this point and I I enjoy them
and I think it's just a
philosophical difference I
believe that providing families
and seniors with the resources
that they need they can then
develop the capacity to care for
themselves so a single mother
with children gets a tax credit
for you know the those children
that gives her additional monies
and you know latitude to be able
to maybe go to school
answer that her children are
getting additional school in and
that advances that family Madam
speaker and gentleman that
that's how I see it and I I
understand you see it
differently gentleman and madam
speaker but that's what we've
been doing for the last few
years I've been very proud Madam
speaker of the of our
willingness to help others lift
themselves up through the
programs that support them Madam
speaker and gentleman.
Administrator and New Delhi from
Los Alamos thank you for that
and and I know that
despite the different ones is
that we look through we're
trying to accomplish the same
goal when I was speaking with
the gentleman for Lee I talked
about why I'm so passionate
about tax policy is because I
really believe it helps families
when there's a good job
so yeah I think you're right
there is a difference in
philosophy here but we are.
Does.
I would like to say trying to
solve.
The same problem and have both
genuine good intentions and I
hope you would agree with that
speaker gentle lady.
to speak madam speaker and of
course I understand and we can
get we're going to be continuing
the stated this debate as we
move forward I think you know
will be moving towards one
another I'm certain of that
Madam speaker and gentleman.
Thank you Mr internally so so I
guess the the last point I
wanted to make an.
And again I'm just gonna be just
candid like I was in Canadian
MSPs are generally you know
after I still really evaluating
what's what's in front of us I
just have to say that.
To me one thing is clear.
this is not a tax reform bill.
This is a governor reelection.
Populist give away tax package
as bigger and gentle lady.
And.
I'm going to.
Again use the words that I used
at the end of the budget debate
German word Phil Smith.
I hope I pronounce it right but
to consider gentlelady the there
is no exact definition for it in
English
but it means sorrow for the
world because of what could have
been I have had so much more
generally I'm gonna be
supporting this legislation and
I thank you for all of your
furnace and hard work.
but I I do really still view
this as a a great lost
opportunity and I hope I hope
sincerely hope that next year is
not to let's push of tax reform
again that we actually do it.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady thank you John Madam
speaker.
There is further debate the
gentle lady from McKinley and
San Juan Representative
Lundstrom.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentle lady yield place Madam
speaker and gentle lady from
McKinley I yield thank you madam
thank you madam speaker thank
you lady did have a couple
questions the first is I'm
reviewing other speaker gentle
lady the FIR and I wanted to
have you of explained what the
total framework for this tax
packages.
For FY twenty three.
Madam speaker gentle lady in
terms of costs and I know this
terminology they appropriations
committee uses uses so the total
cost of recurring is three
hundred and sixty seven hundred
and fifty five million dollars
there are some nonrecurring
items as well Madam speaker ed
totaling about sixteen million
five hundred dollars.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady and also I'm
looking at sections eight and
nine and if you could please
explain what this does.
Madam speaker gentle lady
sections eight and nine of the
bill.
Sections eight and nine of the
bill I'm looking at the FIR on
page four four there's some of
discussion of what sections
eight and nine to.
It starts with reducing the
rates of the gross receipts tax.
Yes Madam speaker and gentle
lady.
What the bill does is IT reduces
the gross receipts tax by one
quarter percent as well as the
compensating tax and there is a
trigger if that's what you're
you're getting out madam speaker
that if revenues drop by more
than five percent.
The point to I will be re
implemented be reinstituted.
madam speaker gentle lady that's
what we wanted to hear the HFC
side wanted to make sure that if
there were an issue with revenue
that it would be reinstated.
Yes ma'am speaker and gentle
lady yes indeed that's what
we're doing because of the
concern that this what bubbles
I'm calling it a bubble madam
speaker and gentle lady could
could not happen could stop and
we don't want to be left in the
lurch administrative for into
lady.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady I'm also looking at the
effective date of the gross
receipts tax provisions of this
bill section seven through
eleven is July one twenty twenty
two the tax credit for nurses is
twenty twenty two only I'm not
sure why why that is madam
speaker gentle lady.
Madam speaker gentle lady this
was a proposal made by the
nurses at for working in
hospitals as away as a thank you
and it's a one time tax credit
madam speaker gentle lady and
that's why it's for that one tax
year three Representative you
know a consolidating the work
that they did for all of us
during this horrible crisis of
COVID.
So madam speaker gentle lady
that is the nine million three
hundred and fifty thousand
nonrecurring.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
McKinley yes that's right.
Very good
The social security madam
speaker gentle lady the social
security exemption is up of cool
for tax years beginning January
one twenty twenty two and I mean
this is a continued reoccurring
issue Madam speaker gentle lady.
Madam speaker gentle lady that's
correct.
Already I appreciate the
discussion this evening I
appreciate the gentle lady's
answers thank you madam speaker.
The gentleman from Chavis Lee
and Roosevelt.
Thank.
Madam chair.
I'm pleased I I'm gonna try to
move my time along in an
expeditious way and madam chair
I've got a floor amendment that
I would.
propose we.
Consider I believe it has been.
distributed already and the
Whatever number that is is point
to to to.
Six nine oh point one.
Madam chair of.
This ammendment.
I'm sorry.
Joe the amendment very much
identified of the amendment
madam chair thank you.
If the amendment has been passed
out in the to to number has been
confirmed is that on the
website.
A gentleman to explain the
amendment.
Thank you madam chair this is a
a narrower amendment and one
that we have discussed already a
bit tonight but none the less I
believe this ammendment deserves
to stand on its own.
Madam chair I heard.
Discussion earlier about vetting
and not vetting and it's
important for the body to know
madam chair this was vetted by
the tax committee as house bill
seventy six.
Which representative Garcia and
I'd pre introduced.
It is a companion bill.
For a bill that senator pope is
caring in the Senate.
Online.
Senator pope Bill madam chairman
there has been a modification to
the bill in front of you the two
pages.
In these two pages we address.
A temporary income tax exemption
for military retirement pay.
I will be short and to the
point.
In listening to the comments of
this body and capacity.
Representative Garcia and I
decided we would face this in in
a three year phase in now
remember earlier testimony was
impact FIR impact of the bill.
All at once is seventeen point
six million dollars I suggest
that of three year phase in
is a six million dollar.
First year impact.
It caps at thirty thousand
dollars.
Starts first year ten thousand
second year twenty thousand
third year thirty thousand.
It has a sunset clause.
It has a sunset clause because
we are trying to fit in.
One small.
Additional.
Tax exemption and I believe if.
Social security and I support
that is accepted this evening we
all went to our veterans to
include them in an income tax
exemption as well on their
retirement pay.
New Mexico is one of eight
states that offers know veteran
retirement.
Income tax exemption at all.
So I'm suggesting this evening.
With the six million dollar
impact and I heard madam
chairman earlier three hundred
and fifty seven million dollar.
Tax expenditure that we have
rounded off of four hundred
billion I'm going to suggest
this evening that we can fit in
the six million dollars.
Twelve million dollars next year
olds seventeen point six million
dollars for third year.
And it sunsets in two thousand
twenty six on Lois's body sees
fit to included in with that
madam chair I stand for
questions.
Gentle lady as a friendly
amendment.
Madam speaker gentleman is not
friendly for many of the reasons
that I've mentioned before.
We had we deliberated as to what
the tax package would be and
elected to focus on items that
has a wide ranging and impact
such as the many many seniors
who are in the middle and lower
income the many many families
who will benefit from the income
tax credit that we're offering
families and this this this
proposal now modified madam
speaker.
Does not fit within the criteria
that we discussed and for that
reason I propose and it is not a
friendly amendment.
There is a debate on the
amendment the gentle lady from
Bernalillo Santa and Santa Fe
Representative Lord thank you
madam speaker will the gentleman
please yield.
Yes madam chair I will you.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman us sorry to dig
through all my paperwork we have
so many amendments and on here
that I finally found the right
one.
So madam speaker and gentleman
it looks like you're trying to
find for that income tax
exemption for military
retirement pay is that correct
yes madam chair lady that's
correct.
Thank you
This came up a little bit
earlier we were discussing this
I I do have a question you do
have the word temporary in here
can you explain to me why it
it's temporary Madam speaker and
gentleman.
Yes madam chair it is because of
this tax exemption will sunset
at the end of taxable year two
thousand twenty six on lesson
action is taken by the
legislature before that.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman something that I want
to bring up earlier but I I miss
the debate I stepped out one for
one second so my husband a
veteran and most of my friends
are veterans and I can tell you
the states are not moving to our
New Mexico.
Veterans that are here when
they're done working with the
labs because we don't have a lot
of incentives and we do tax on
military pay are moving to other
states most of the state that
they are moving to or like South
Dakota Wyoming Idaho Utah with
better tax rates overall but
what they also have that we
don't have to which it is more
enticing as those places have an
economy's huge economies and
sometimes I wonder Madam speaker
and and and gentleman we don't
have a booming economy I mean I
look at one of Wyoming and they
have all those oil and gas and
they don't even tax their people
they don't have a.
A state income tax and I don't
understand why we're not like my
Wyoming madam speaker and
gentleman because we have all
this money that we can get from
oil and gas but instead we seem
to be going in the opposite
direction and I just want to say
that I I think you because
there's twenty five other states
that do not tax military
benefits and when we have all
our best and brightest that are
working at the labs and if
they're military veterans guess
what they're going to move to
they're gonna move like
everybody else out of state
because they won't be taxes well
there's a better tax structure
overall in of those other states
but I think we should offer an
and appreciate those we should
offer some sort of an incentive
to keep our military men and
women here in the state instead
of having them leave a Senator
done working their jobs here so
I do appreciate you bringing
this for like the other
representative well for military
benefits thank you madam speaker
and gentleman.
There's further debate the
gentleman from curry county
Representative Crowder thank you
madam speaker will gentleman
from Chavis please you yes I
will Madam speaker thank you
gentleman Joan I heard you say
that in your amendment has a
sunset clause I turned to the
back to look for it and it's not
where I thought it would be but
it's on the front page and the
fact that you one item three
said it stops through twenty
twenty six and so that's start
date is for your call and your
son said is that correct
gentleman Madam speaker that is
correct I the gentleman I
referred to it as a sunset but
in reality the exemption would
expire unless there was a action
prior to that date by this body
thank you June the gentleman I
just want to stand in support of
your amendment
I have a military facility in my
district Canada airforce base
and a lot of the folks that that
are stationed at the base come
into the community and buyer
services and and
I go to church with a lot of the
folks that go that our station
again and therefore space and I
constantly hear that no we're
not going to consider retiring
here.
Because there's other states
like Florida and others for we
can go and we don't have any
taxes there are personal income
our retirement income.
And I I haven't stood up tonight
but I thought you know I've
heard this offered enough times
that it is serious and I know
it's a real concern in the
community where I live in the
district that I represent.
As I want to stand in support of
your Mentzer thank you very much
I appreciate you bringing
forward I like the one is the
permanent.
Just do away with the tax on on
this but a phased approach in
another look at it and for five
years is a good approach I want
to stand and support you thank
you madam speaker.
The gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln County Representative
fiber.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentleman from Chavis Lee and
Roosevelt yield.
Madam speaker I will happily
yield.
Madam speaker yielded by walking
across a four.
Madam speaker and gentleman of
may of Mr statement but how much
does this
propose.
Tax reduction of cost or how
much tax who would not be
receiving if we were to
implement this thank you
gentlemen madam speaker the FIR
of which reported on house bill
seventy six in the tax and
revenue Committee was seventeen
point six million dollars
however that was so full thirty
thousand dollar exemption one
time staff I staged the steps in
order to respond to some
concerns that the individuals
had in them for in my simple
math the calculation is a little
less than six million dollars
and more importantly.
The three hundred and fifty
seven million dollars is two
percent so the impact of doing
this is to percent.
And I believe that is a
reasonable doubt on this evening
to the tax bills thank you madam
speaker gentle.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
The.
Community that the two of us
Representative.
That's traditionally
attracted many veterans.
Particularly following the
closing of Walker airforce base
of about sixty years ago.
And.
Those retirees.
From the.
Various branches of our.
Military service.
Really sustain our economy for
many years.
There and so I I I look at this
piece of legislation and and
look at this not only through
the eyes of providing the tax
breaks to veterans who may wish
to move to our state.
But I look at it as an
opportunity to.
Grow our state.
As you know madam speaker and
gentleman.
Our growth has stagnated the
last decade.
And.
I believe that this is an area
that New Mexico ought to shine.
We have better weather the many
of the state so we're just
mentioned a moment ago.
We have a lower cost of living.
We have.
bases army bases and maybe more
importantly to to this age group
we have of health care
facilities that should attract
veterans to our state and I
think this is a small measure
of.
Madam speaker and gentleman to
to attract these veterans and so
madam speaker and gentleman my
question is.
Do you see this for as maybe
more cost.
Give up some tax revenue but at
the end do you see this measure
as being one that will actually.
Thank you for itself in terms of
enhanced revenues to our state
through
the economic value that these
retirees find.
Thank you gentlemen
personally I do gentleman madam
speaker however the attack the
attacks and Revenue FIR included
no.
Compensating benefit in taxes
from.
New Mexicans coming here in New
New Mexicans coming here and
paying taxes.
Mr speaker there are madam
speaker and gentleman of the
just because the FIR doesn't
include it doesn't mean that
that that would be the case
because.
Madam speaker and gentleman you
can personally testify to what
happened and Rossell following
the closure of Walker for space
and the.
For that we made to attract
retirees to our community and
how it really sustain our
economy for I would guests at
least twenty five years
following that closer
and your personal experience so
you might share that with the
body.
Absolutely madam speaker of the
closure of military facilities
in New Mexico has been a painful
one communities of.
Roswell to my knowledge is the
only one well Hobbs had one now
that I think about it but the
point is is that it's painful
experience great economic
disruption and we benefit from
the many veterans who live in
rossoll in addition New Mexico
is eighth in the country in the
number of veterans that live in
New Mexico so we Hey can add to
that gentleman and become a
growing state thank you with
this bold action this evening on
the floor the.
Madam speaker and gentleman I
would urge the body to seriously
consider taking these small
steps because I do think in the
long run this would be an
economic boost to several of our
communities around the state not
just the communities that have a
military installation currently.
But other communities that hold
themselves out as being great
places to retire with a low cost
of living and those things
coupled with maybe this
taxadvantaged may cause.
Question what is.
I think that was Representative
for heart of.
You madam chair Madam speaker
and gentleman I I think that
that we're aware of the.
is not only to the communities
with the military installation
but many of the other
communities around the state
including my hometown of of
Rossell and so madam speaker and
gentleman
with that I don't have any
further questions but I would
encourage the body to seriously
consider whether this is a step
in the drop right direction as
to why thank you madam speaker
thank the gentleman thank you
madam chair that concludes my
debate on this ammendment I
would ask for a voice vote.
My and the.
I.
The representative sorry the
gentleman from Bernalillo Cibola
McKinley Socorro San Juan and
Valencia County.
Madam speaker above the.
Thank you madam chair madam
speaker I'm sorry for the
opportunity the gentleman from
childhood to do and results on
the field I would gladly yield

state.
Well.
Gentleman you perhaps no better
than I and I appreciate your
service to our country in the
service of other veterans who
live here in New Mexico I
believe Senator patrons can move
to New Mexico in enjoyed this
great state they tend madam
chair to be a younger.
Retiree that often more often
than not are looking for their
next.
Career employment they break
military skills that are
deficient in our work force.
And I believe welcome urging
them to come and moving off the
role Madam chairman of one of
eight states that does no income
tax exemption on retirees is.
is where New Mexico needs to say
goodbye tonight and I hope this
body will bring this ammendment
it's affordable and we are
We're prepared so with that I
guess madam chair I've been.
Perhaps till that we better do
it on a roll call thank you
Madam.
Well I'm perfectly happy either
way madam chair.
You have your roll call vote is
the representative from all of
those counties done.
Madam chair actually mold of a
few more questions but maybe
Madam chair.
I mean Madam I'm sorry thank you
madam chair I stand for.
Of the gentleman from charity
and rule original County the as
water bring a point of sale
hundred forty two thousand one
hundred eighty seven better
this.
In New Mexico that's about nine
percent of the population of
civilian population the madam
speaker and gentleman of hundred
twenty thousand five hundred
said your mail one thousand six
hundred seventeen our female
veterans advocate just
concerning to me that we have so
much money in the budget for
like four hundred million
dollars I think and said and we
really need to look at the
sayings to see how we can
attract more veterans.
For state the veteran madam
speaker and of Representative
from native colonies these are
the people are teacher the
medical staff general contractor
workers you know your name in
the list goes on and on and I'm
concerned we could not of do
what we need to freeze Veterans
if there's any action to that
fine if not we'll move on thank
you madam speaker.
Chairman thank you so much for
those remarks and madam chair I
do believe that if there are no
others that concludes my debate.
I'm sorry madam chair.
Gentlelady from grant it
augments here it were you
debating on the amendment.
Thank you thank you madam
speaker with the gentleman
yield.
Madam chair I yield thank you
madam speaker thank you
gentlemen do you know what our
budget is that we invest in
veterans in our state with our
state budget.
I am not prepared madam chair
this evening to answer that on
our eight point.
Eight billion four hundred and
seventy million dollars but
there are.
Areas in our state budget that
address the needs of our
veterans here in New Mexico.
Miss madam speaker and gentleman
it's about it's it's about five
and a half million dollars and
then when you add the federal
match the entire budget for
veterans associate for veterans
department is a little over six
point three million.
Million.
In an eight point four billion
dollar budget.
Thanks.
What would you agree
one generation.
Madam madam speaker gentleman's.
Less than one percent and how
much is the the cost of this
ammendment.
My calculation is two percent
above three hundred and fifty
seven million dollars at six
million dollars in food in the
first fiscal year.
That is the current element and
I I've seen.
It with the some of the bills
that are coming through here.
Never been vetted haven't
brought up before first time we
seen them.
Monies and house bill two just
launching programs at ten
million dollars and this is been
brought forth for years and
years Kerry by Senator Burt
Kerry by members on this side.
I don't know how much more
vetted a tax credit could get.
Madam speaker gentleman how many
states tax veterans retirement
income.
Hi this evening madam chair the
gentle lady do not have that
statistic at my hand but I
believe for memory it's thirty
two out of the fifty I believe
but I don't have the exact date
at my hand Madam speaker and
gentleman that exempt that tax
that's correct so so the
majority exempt the tax how
about our neighbors like Arizona
Colorado Texas.
Thank you madam chair of.
The.
There is no on his chest.
just their exemption.
Recently in the last year and
part of the the the debate madam
chair that I thought was
particularly interesting was the
FIR in Arizona actually handle
that back.
To the cost of the.
Income tax exemption they value
this population coming to
Arizona with their professional
skill sets and and building a
better Arizona and I would
welcome them here in New Mexico
as well madam chair generally
Madden Madam speaker and
gentleman I value them to.
Thank you know.
Your co sponsor has been a
champion on this.
As well as I mean I this year I
thought my gosh I'll just
introduce a million dollar bill
because are disabled American
veterans there's a federal
program that provides a match to
the vehicle but our local
disabled American veterans are
VFW American legions have to
raise the money for the other
half of the vehicle just to
transport veterans to and from
their appointments we could even
get in the budget a million
dollars for vehicles when when
they've been shut down no choice
of their own not able to have
fund raisers not able to get the
match can't find enough
volunteer drivers don't have the
money to pay for their food I
mean our veterans day they
served us and we should be
keeping our promises to them I
really look forward Madam
speaker and gentleman to
supporting your bill it's the
least we can do to say thank
you.
It's just it's the right thing
to do and it's been vetted I
mean I don't even understand the
whole that a question on how he
built I saw this year that never
happened vetted before creating
apps and without ever being
vetted before now they're in the
house bill two budget and by the
way.
Madam speaker and gentleman
someone brought up the fact of
oil was in the interim committee
that's the the agenda for the
interim committee.
Meetings.
Madam chair gentle lady that is
a really good question because I
suppose the correct answer might
be the chairman but in reality
I'm not sure that's accurate
either so I'm gonna pass on that
question that a lady a metal
chair madam madam speaker and
gentleman it sure not those of
us in the minority and you know
it depends on the chairman if
you're able to get something on
the agenda but definitely when
it comes to tax reform the idea
that we actually we would be
good for veterans in the idea
that we can actually get a rate
of return attracting retirees
with retirement income doesn't
seem to make it to the in terms
so it theoretically you can
always say it's never vetted.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen thank you madam
chair with that I close.
All I don't.
The gentleman from Lee County
Representative Pettigrew.
Thank you madam speaker and the
gentleman from from only
in Travis county please you yes

The gentle lady from Los Alamos
Rio Arriba Sandoval and Santa Fe
counties.
Thank you madam speaker and
thank you gentleman from Chavis

listened to your arguments and
given that it's it's stepped up
with the sunset.
I consider this a friendly
amendment thank you madam chair
I conclude my debate.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you for all those in favor

As opposed saying that our.
The amendment the eyes have it
the amendment has been adopted.
Back to debate on the bill.
The gentle lady from Bernalillo
Representative Thomson.
Thank you madam speaker my
questions have been answered.
There is further debate the
gentle lady from caption Sapporo
and Valencia County
representative Armstrong.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentle lady from Los Alamos Rio
Arriba Sandoval and Santa Fe
yield.
Madam speaker gentle lady I
yield.
Thank you kind lady I'm I'm
impressed with a lot of the
things Madam speaker gentle lady
that are in this tax package.
Can you tell me the
Was at the table.
To put the tax package together.
Madam speaker gentle lady.
I will well first of all madam
speaker gentle lady the entire
committee because the entire
committee looked at all of the
bills that came through the
committee and as you know madam
speaker any bill with a six
fiscal impact is tabled until we
can evaluate the entire package
to ensure that we can fall
within what our capacity is
Madam speaker gentle lady.
The team that we looked at the
Possible tax package was myself
and the leader I also consulted
with the ranking member from the
minority Representative Harper.
And asked whether or not there
any
Specific proposals that the rank
the minority wish to be included
in the package and the I'd say
that was the team that and of
course we consulted madam
speaker with the speaker.
Thank you madam speaker and
thank you kindly for that
information I was just curious I
know there's you know some
working groups that get together
and I was just curious who was
there for that so with that
madam speaker I'd like to offer
an amendment.
The amendment has been passed
out.
Would you with the gentle lady
read the two oh two number yes
madam speaker it's two two two.
Seven five seven point one.
Gentlelady to explain the
amendment thank you madam
speaker this amendment is
something that I have been and
many of my peers have been
working on for several years.
And to use
one of my peers statements early
from earlier is.
madam speaker is that it's time.
It's time to fully exempt social
security.
madam speaker body this has been
something that we've talked
about for several years.
madam speaker this is.
amendments to fully exempt
social security from income tax.
pretty plain and simple.
Madam speaker.
And and body we're one of twelve
states left additional taxes
social security.
Income.
we will if we leave it the way
it is in the package we will
still be on the bad list.
One of the bad lists for the
state of New Mexico where
retirees will not want to come
here.
Our New Mexico will still be on
that list Madam speaker.
body.
Of retirees bring their money
with them when they come to New
Mexico.
Retirees in New Mexico are the
ones who volunteer in our
libraries.
The ones who substitute teach in
our schools.
The ones who offer child care.
When child care.
There's no room in the day cares
or child care centers.
Adam speaker they're the ones
that volunteer in our libraries
the ones that
Bring so much.
To society and to New Mexico.
Madam speaker of the body
there's several agencies.
That spoke in favor of this
legislation there's several
bills that.
Wanted to fully exempt Senate
bills and house bill's Madam
speaker gentle lady
a a RP.
was in favor of this aging and
long term secretary Katrina
hold from Lopez stated she was
for this and the tax and
Representative secretary
secretary Schardin Clarke stated
she was for this.
And I don't think that it's fair
for our retirees to be told.
How much money they need to live
on this and without madam
speaker all stand for questions.
I'd like a roll call vote.
Gentlelady from Los Alamos Rio
Arriba Sandoval and Santa Fe is
this a friendly amendment
speaker it is not I agree there
were members of the public could
came forward and spoke in favor
of this there are also many
members of the public who are
not in favor of exempting any
of social security and they also
participated in our hearings and
what we did madam speaker we
evaluated the proposal and I
think came up with a very fair
compromise madam speaker and
that is to allow middle income
and lower income seniors to have
their social security income
exempt recognizing they would
benefit the most from that that
tax
exemption but individuals making
very high incomes.
Frankly such as my husband's do
not need a social security tax
exemption and many of them spoke
against such an exemption
recognizing they don't need it
stay with us to support the
services in the state such as
paying their fair share of the
income tax and they're happy to
do it and I would point now.
Madam speaker New Mexico ranks
very well in terms of its
personal income tax we have on
the whole madam speaker gentle
lady a low personal income tax
which is friendly to seniors as
well so for those reasons and
I'm sure I could think of others
I do not support of that
consider this a friendly
amendment.
Seeing debate the gentle lady
from Andy.
Thank you madam speaker well the
gentle lady from.
A Caltrans the core of the lens
here please yield yes I kindly
yield.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady so I I stand in full
support of this floor amendment.
I have been listening to my
constituents for many years now
and this is something that keeps
coming up it means a lot to them
of that they're being taxed on
their social security income
they they want to see that stop
so madam speaker gentle lady if
you don't mind I just like to
visit with you a little bit
about what you're hearing as
well and that I I have a few
comments and questions.
Madam speaker gentle lady so
what are your constituents
saying.
Madam speaker gentle lady
overwhelmingly amount to fall in
favor of my personal the Mike my
constituents and along with
several others across the state
of New Mexico my emails have
been overwhelmed madam speaker
gentle lady
I first came up with this idea
madam speaker gentle lady from a
constituent.
Brought this to my attention I
am not retired and so I wasn't
aware of it and so when it was
brought to my attention madam
speaker gentle lady I was
actually.
The last honest that this was
happening in the state of New
Mexico.
Madam speaker generally so I I
I'm getting the same kind of
committee and have for years and
I know that you and I gentle
lady have carried this
legislation now I think we for
the last six years if I recall
correctly.
And built in the past have also
been brought forward even before
we begin the effort but Madam
speaker gentle lady as I
understand that there are five
bills on this topic during this
session and gentle lady you and
I were first out of the gate
with the pre-filing on January
eleventh seven days before the
start of the session and that's
house bill forty eight.
two senators are brought Senate
bill forty nine on opening day.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
Senator filed an identical bill
to the when we we introduced
Senate bill one oh eight and
that calls for full repeal as
well.
And then Madam speaker gentle
lady
Two senators then on January
twentieth also on the twentieth
of of the bill for full repeal
of that Senate bill one twenty
one.
So madam speaker gentle lady
four of the five bills that were
introduced a session called for
a full repeal.
And I think that's significant
and madam speaker gentle lady
the governor.
Actually followed these efforts
with a public statement during
her state of the state address
that she to favor the full
repeal is that not correct Madam
speaker and gentle lady.
Madam speaker gentle lady yes I
was sitting in my seat right
here on this house floor when I.
Was listening to the governors
of state of the state address
and advocating for a repeal of
school security and so I was I
was a shocked and excited at the
same time madam speaker gentle
lady.
Madam speaker gentle lady I I
had the same reaction I was very
surprised and very pleased as
well so madam speaker and gentle
lady I think what.
Many of us have tried to do in
the legislature is to make this
much needed and deserve tax
relief an unavoidable issue for
this legislative session.
Madam speaker gentle lady would
you agree with that.
Madam speaker gentle lady
according to the amount of bills
filed and for the years that we
and others have been filing on
madam speaker gentle lady I
agree.
So madam speaker and gentle lady
so
we've heard this evening and and
in person committee hearings
that only twelve states tax
social security income.
And that this tax is a deterrent
for many retirees to come to New
Mexico and madam speaker gentle
lady the legislature's of so
many other states to figure this
out and they have remove that
tax of on the retirees so I
agree with you that the time has
come the time is now to repeal
this tax in full immediately for
the sake of our retirees.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
I think we can all pick up our
cell phones or get on a computer
and Google or whatever the term
is search for best states to
retire.
And what I have found it I did
to make this on and off for
several years now is that we
keep getting a black guy over
taxation of social security
income and it means would make
the list of states that are not
friendly places to retire
especially in terms of tax
policy and practice.
So madam speaker and gentle lady
we heard from a a RP of their in
full support of the full repeal
but you know you look at
Kiplinger's for Yahoo finance
wallet have money just about any
source and we seem to still be
on that list so madam speaker
gentle lady if of full repeal
does not occur in New Mexico.
Do we get off the bed list.
Madam speaker gentle lady now
unfortunately we stay on that
list and retirees will retire to
the states that border New
Mexico.
Madam speaker gentle lady I
agree with you completely so I
think that's one of the reasons
to make a clean break with this
tax let's just be done with it.
Let's just let's just say New
Mexico is a great place to
retire for a lot of reasons this
one included.
So madam speaker and gentle lady
that we know that New Mexico has
set certain tax triggers for
triggering the tax and that in
the
what would be funny apple for a
little bit madam speaker gentle
lady so the the federal
government started taxing social
security in nineteen eighty four
it's my understanding.
In New Mexico followed suit a
few years later I think was
about nineteen ninety and so for
thirty almost forty years we
have not adjusted for inflation.
And back when this taxation
started Madam speaker the
minimum wage was three dollars
and thirty five cents an hour
and we are now approaching
fifteen dollars an hour so
incomes going up but the tax was
still triggered.
Just by having to so much income
so I think
you know this is a very strong
reason for change to occur now.
it's been said Madam speaker
gentle lady that.
this tax package with certain
ceilings placed on income above
which the tax would apply this
is a reasonable compromise.
But madam speaker and gentle
lady is it the best course of
action in your opinion.
Speaker gentle lady
I don't believe so I think the
best course of action is as you
stated earlier madam speaker
gentle lady is let's repeal this
let's be done with the let's get
off of the the the list that is
keeping retirees from coming to
New Mexico.
So madam speaker internally so
we would in essence by adopting
your for amendment we would get
rid of that ball and chain that
drugs are state down.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
does your for amendment adjust
for inflation is there in any
kind of the
Division in the floor amendment
that would adjust for inflation
in years future.
Madam speaker gentle lady no
madam speaker gentle lady I I
thought about
adding that into this a in a
different floor amendment.
But I really think that the the
full repeal is the way to go
there so there's no adjustment
there's just a full repeal so
madam speaker gentle lady I
think what you're saying is that
there's no need for an inflation
adjuster because a full repeal
doesn't doesn't just have to
have a cause that going to win
the whole thing is going on is
that correct Madam speaker kind
lady yes that's correct so Madam
speaker and gentle lady we've
heard some comments tonight on
the floor that some retirees
just don't need this tax relief.
And that may be true for some
but madam speaker and gentle
lady is not the principle of the
matter that whoever it is
because the retiree that person
worked for years and years and
years.
Have money taken out of the
paycheck every paycheck period
that money was talked into
social security and it was taxed
at that point in New Mexico by
taxing it when the people have
retired direction taxing it
twice Madam speaker gentle lady
and to understand that
correctly.
Madam speaker gentle lady are
you nailed it.
Madam speaker and gentle lady so
it would be my position that
every Tyrese should be welcome
to New Mexico with their tax
policies across the board and we
don't have to have in the of
other people if they've worked
hard and saved but Madam speaker
gentle as so many people are
living on their social security
and they really do depend on it
and the benefit of their bargain
was.
The government would take all
this money for their benefit in
retirement now the government
taxes it not just once but twice
so madam speaker and gentle lady
wanted to focus a little bit.
On the idea that people have to
take this tax exemption if it if
we pass it into law on the
governor's of course I is it
minister generally does your
amendment say that these
retirees have to claim or may
claim.
Madam speaker gentle lady it
says me.
Madam speaker generally so folks
who think they can give a little
for go the exemption could
certainly do so and know what's
going to force them to take this
exemptions that correct Madam
speaker gentle lady that's
correct and there is also a it
gives room for if they do take
the exemption dares
philanthropic they can do to put
that money back into the
into the economic development of
the state of New Mexico as well
or they can forgo taking the tax
credit.
And madam speaker generally so I
did a little calculation and of
house bill one sixty three
remains intact with the caps on
income above which social
security would be taxed
if if we went with the full
repeal the difference is about
thirty four million dollars I
believe and so madam speaker
generally I think it's important
for the members of the body to
realize that that money is very
likely most likely probably
going to be put back into the
economy through spending of
visiting restaurants of
traveling to our beautiful on
sites our parks and things like
that in the state of buying
things that people need so madam
speaker generally could you just
address a little bit about how.
We consider the foregoing of
certain tax revenue by doing a
full repeal but we're not
accounting for the upside in
terms of economic activity thank
you madam speaker and kind lady
From a lot of the emails that I
received people want to move
here.
The want to move here they want
to bring their money with them
they want to put it into
economic development they want
to buy homes here they want to
buy motor homes here they want
to travel around the state and
we are not accounting Madam
speaker gentle lady for the
money that will put be put back
into the economy.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
thank you I I believe it's
called dynamic scoring and we
don't do it in New Mexico it's
it's probably a little
complicated and you need people
who can really follow all the
factors on that but I think this
is actually going to be
positive for New Mexico if this
four minute passes.
Madam speaker internally I just
think it's I agree it's time we
do this it's what people want.
It doesn't heard anybody it
actually helps everybody and for
that reason I I do stand in
favor of your amendment and I
just want to point out a rather
shocking statistic madam
speaker.
And that is that there are so
many senior citizens who are
raising their grandchildren and
I didn't know what was as high
as it is it's forty nine
percent.
Of senior citizens retirees are
raising their grandchildren.
And they need that extra money
in their pockets it may be on
the order of seven hundred
dollars a year extra to them if
there's a full repeal of this
tax.
So let's think about the grand
children as well as the retirees
let's think about the nurses and
the firefighters the first
responders all the people.
To make New Mexico work and in
their retirement they deserve to
be treated fairly it is their
money Madam speaker gentle lady.
they worked for it the promise
was it would be there for them
in retirement and madam speaker
gentle lady it is true.
That that.
The states were never meant to
get revenue off of social
security income.
And the there's a little story
behind that how that came to be
in New Mexico
Madam speaker gentle lady I'll
just close with that there was a
bill about well we're at ten
thirty PM tonight but I was
around close to midnight a few
years ago nineteen ninety one
and some legislation came to the
king to the legislature table
for and that was stuck in the
bill and I think was one cents
towards the back of the bill was
not debated.
And had it been debated and has
the public been aware of it I
don't think this tax would have
been imposed so madam speaker
gentle lady thank you very much.
Seeing further debate the
gentleman from Chavis and the
and the data thank you.
Madam speaker very quickly
Well the gentle lady yield.
Yes I yield.
Thank you I apologize
For things that I think your
bill addresses that need to be
addressed in New Mexico.
Twenty percent of the seniors in
New Mexico live in poverty.
New Mexico seniors are second in
the nation and food and
security.
Poverty rate in.
Poverty rate of seniors in New
Mexico is on an incline.
As the gentle lady from eighty
mention a rising number of
seniors are raising
grandchildren.
Rio Arriba McKinley semalam San
Miguel Dona Ana Sierra Torrance
to coral and Luna are the
leading counties in New Mexico.
Where seniors live in poverty.
Your bill will address that.
It will raise the standard of
living of seniors in poverty it
will raise the standard of
living of their grand children
that they have in their home and
that is what this legislature
should be doing is raising the
standard of living of New Mexico
thank the gentle lady.
The gentle lady from granted
dial going Sierra thank you
madam speaker will the
gentlelady yields yes madam
speaker I yield to the gentle
lady.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady I think
something that we're forgetting
about because I've heard debate
year after year after year after
year what six years to be exact
that's how long we've been in
the body and joining on to
Representative rounds efforts
and and I know they were they
were going on long before we got
here but it what we keep hearing
is we can't afford it for issued
only we should only take we
should only give it how does it
benefit the poor the one of the
things I think we don't think
about the impact is the amount
of savings that the senior
citizens in the state contribute
to tax to to to New Mexicans
Madam speaker and gentle lady.
In some years thirty three
percent of families of children
are being raised by their
grandparents grandparents or
extended family members are
great anti their great uncle and
madam speaker and gentle lady
childcare is not cheap so the
some some grandparents are
simply acting as the care giver
during the day.
Some have custody attempt like
because to your they lead they
slit they live with them but
they don't have custody and
others have complete casting the
raising grandchildren they're
saving a state so much money in
the short I. be in foster care
children that would be in child
care centers our our cost of
child care has doubled.
In the last two years in our
state and so I mean it's it's.
The idea that that we should
only give a tax exemption for
people so security exams the
poor people to me is.
This is another way of saying
thank you for what they're doing
on behalf of families in the
state and and our most
vulnerable children.
Women who are single who are
raising children on their own
are heavily dependent on their
parents and their aunts and
uncles these are our senior
citizens to care for their
children during the day that's
why it is in my district Madam
speaker and gentle lady is that
how it is and yours madam
speaker gentle lady yes there's
more grandparents raising
grandchildren of every year in
and several of my counties.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady and they're doing
that
Doing that out of kindness
they're doing it in the years
when they should be able to be
enjoying retirement and they're
giving again.
Giving again my freshman year I
don't remember exactly the
budget was around like six and a
half billion dollars I was just
six years ago two billion
dollars the budget has grown we
still say we can't afford it if
not now when.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady.

Gentle lady you still have

Thank you madam speaker to say

understatement Madam speaker
to see again here after year
after year it's not passing.
Is a disappointment Madam
speaker I think the people that
voted not to table and
I'm hoping Madam speaker that we
don't come back again next year
and say darn I wish we would
have had some better tax reform
thank you madam speaker.
The gentle lady from Santa Fe.
Thank you madam speaker does the
gentle lady from Los Alamos and
all those other counties sealed.
gentlelady from Santa Fe I yield
thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady I have the honor
of sitting on your tax committee
and we have seen a lot of bills
this session and there are a lot
of great ones and I am just so
grateful to this chairwoman for
having vetted through and really
speaking to our values you know
often times because of the
budget budget session we talk
about where we put our money and
when we put our.
Investment in is where our
values are and I just wanna
commends you madam madam
gentlelady madam speaker gentle
lady on the incredible job that
really shows where we are in our
value proposition through this
tax package.
And I **** question in our
committee today as we were
vetting this on because I think
it's important as we've been
discussing some of our
priorities in
eliminating poverty in our state
and being able to support our
seniors her elders.
Those who are receiving their
social security payments
currently and I've gotten tons
of emails I'm sure the entire
body has gotten thousands of
emails on this topic.
And I just want to make really
clear because we talked a lot
about eliminating poverty
through this provision of the in
the tax package of who we were
targeting and why I want to be
really really clear
Madam speaker gentle lady what
is going on with the social
security tax repeal in this tax
package.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady for that question
there was a lot of talk in the
last some discussion with the
last amendment madam speaker
gentle lady about seniors and
poverty and so on and of course
we want to help seniors in
poverty but I want to underscore
this point Madam speaker and
gentle lady and that is the tax
exemption on social security has
a means test.
And the means to us is a hundred
thousand dollars a hundred
thousand dollars for a single
filers a single person filing in
the means test for a married
couple filing jointly is a
hundred and fifty thousand
dollars those those income
levels.
Are definitely well within the
middle class Madam speaker
gentle lady it's not perhaps
even in the upper middle class
when you think madam speaker
that the median income of New
Mexicans is fifty one thousand
dollars so this is tax exemption
that serves many many of seniors
on social security in the state
and I think it's a very fair
compromise gentle lady
given the cost expended the
expenditure involved Madam
speaker gentle lady.
Thank you thank you general
thank you madam speaker gentle
lady so what I'm hearing.
Is that if you are making six
figures as an individual which
is a great income depending on
where you are in the state and I
know some of your constituents
maybe well above that and some
of money as well
and that's who we're saying if
you're already making that
amount of money we're not
exempting you because seems like
you're going to be doing okay
and we may revisit this in the
future if at any time.
Making a hundred thousand
dollars an individual or a
hundred fifty thousand dollars
as a couple maybe.
You know beyond the the capacity
that you we do think we want to
be able to give a tax exemption
for
Madam speaker gentle lady is
this can we revisit this if we
need to Madam speaker gentle
lady we've passed legislation
every year I do want to make an
additional point if I may
generally and that is there's
been a lot of talk this evening
Madam speaker gentle lady about
how we want to broad based tax
structure broaden the base so
that everyone pays their fair
share well.
When you think about it when you
start giving tax exemptions
madam speaker gentle lady your
narrowing the tax base and as we
move forward madam speaker
gentle lady on tax reform in the
next year.
Hopefully we'll all keep that in
mind that the goal is to broaden
the tax base so that we can
lower taxes.
Not for special groups of but
for everyone.
Thank you madam the speaker and
thank you gentle lady I I so
appreciate that because when
we're looking at some of the
wiggle room that we still see in
the budget what we're talking
about four hundred million
dollars
awhile back and we see how this
budget proceeds it is well
within our fiscal responsibility
to do so.
and it's and it's very much well
thought out as to all of the
different proposals that we had
with social security which bit
that being one of I think one of
the biggest issues that we've
heard about this session so
again just want to appreciate
where you've gone with us and
where we are seeking to go as we
continue our tax reform effort.
Inject madam speaker gentle lady
I also just wanted to key in on
some of the highlights that I
think are so exciting to bring
home to our community
The child income tax credit when
we saw what was happening at the
federal level and I think in a
lot of states we're many of
these tax credits have gone away
from the federal system
Madam speaker gentle lady can
you talk about what families can
expect that have small children
at home what is it that they can
do to be able to access this tax
credit should it pass through
this body Madam speaker
gentle lady thank you for that
question and yes indeed we we're
focusing on helping as many
people in the state as possible
with tax relief and of course we
did find the tax exemption for
social security within the
boundaries that I've already
explained Madam speaker and
gentle lady and then we also
look to families families with
children we all know that the
the struggle in the state and
many of them have financial
needs and the needs to support
their children and so what we
proposed and this was something
that Representative Cadena
online proposed in twenty
nineteen and we brought it back
this year as a proposal was the
child income tax credit and it's
based on income the lower the
income that you have the higher
the rebate or tax credit that
you get and it is refundable
Madam speaker and and gentle
lady and it allows for the for
the lower income individuals it
allows a hundred and seventy
five dollars per child every
year.
And that's a great boost and I
would go Madam speaker and
gentle lady that the federal
program expired in December.
And we know a number of things
one it was a very very popular
program with people because the
country and I hope our the our
citizens in the state recognize
that working families and
families of all economic levels
need this financial assistance
and it has served the country
well hoping it will be
re renewed if when Congress gets
its act together but we do have
our act together gentle lady and
Madam speaker and this is going
to be a tremendous help to
families with children in the
state speaker gentle lady thank
you madam speaker gentle lady I
don't I disagree about Congress
having the ability to get their
act together but that's another
that's another day the madam
speaker gentle lady that said so
on a tax credit how does that
work for in real time if if I
have you know two children at
home they're under the age of.
Eighteen.
And I am making minimum wage.
And so I have do I qualify for
that tax credit madam speaker
gentle lady Madam speaker gentle
lady yes I think I think you
would qualify.
And madam speaker gentle lady
how does a tax credit work first
as a reimbursement verses
You know with a rebate tell me
how that how that works in our
tax code madam speaker gentle
lady.
Thank you gentlelady and madam
speaker what what you do is when
you're filling out your tax
return to claim the credit and
that in that is essentially
income that you get to keep and
if your income is lower than the
credit amount if you have a and
in a sense negative income you
get a check in the mail and so
this is a refundable credit so
there may be very low income
people who don't pay taxes and
will get a check in the mail to
help and support their families
thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady this is
something I hadn't quite
realised I think a few years ago
when our first for my first time
on this tax committee is that
those that have trouble or me
worry about paying taxes may
actually get the biggest benefit
out of it and so much of what I
think is that the value
proposition of this amount of
super gentle lady is that we're
asking people to let help us
help you
by being able to file this
identify where you are in
income.
And and let us know what's going
on so we can help and I think
that's what's was so interesting
to me madam speaker gentle lady
about how these tax credits work
is that it's about reporting and
then we get more data and
understanding about how we can
tweak our systems that be that
help us understand where we can
meet people where they are.
And madam speaker gentle lady I
just it was it was sort of like
a label that went off for me in
our first tax committees that
the more people file their taxes
the more we might be able to
help them out.
Senator generally that was
something that I I feel it's
still resounding.
from the sort of fear that
paying for reporting on some of
these things might actually be a
bigger budget so I just really
wanted to Kian for those out
there that if you report this we
might be able to give you more
of a deduction madam speaker
gentle lady especially for those
families that are seeking to
provide that support.
matters the madam speaker gentle
lady another big piece of this
bill that I thought was so
exciting and we saw a lot of
these bills was in the
Tax credits for renewable energy
Madam speaker gentle lady we saw
everything from geo bonds to
solar to wind to different tax
credits across the board both
for industry for
Home developments residential
development can you talk a
little bit about Madam speaker
gentle lady how this solar
market development income tax
credit came to fruition and why
this was the one chosen based on
so many of the different
renewable energy bills that we
did see in our committee madam
speaker gentle lady.
Yes Madam speaker gentle lady
and I'm really glad that you
brought the solar development
tax credit up this is a tax
credit that has been in place
for a while and with so many of
our tax credits and deductions
and exemptions and so on madam
speaker we have a sunset on on
on those things so that you know
we have to re evaluate them
every year every so often so
that we can determine whether or
not they're achieving the goals
that we would like them to
achieve and in this case
Representative Ferrary brought
this proposal that we extends
the length of the tax credit for
solar equipment for your home
and of what it what it includes
is and a lengthening of the
sunset.
And it also provides that the
credit is refundable.
And transferable.
And it also provides that the
person purchasing the equipment
gets a ten percent
tax credit for the value of of
the items that they're
purchasing that supports the the
solar
commitment that they're
installing on their home so
this is an important part of our
bill.
Because I think we've all agreed
that we need to be well maybe
not all that the majority of us
have agreed that we need to be
focusing on supporting advances
in renewable energy in the state
and stand and supporting that
industry and this tax credit
Madam speaker gentle lady it is
inconsistent with that Colin
Madam speaker gentle lady on I'm
like I'm still learning so much
about the tax code and and
recognizing their a lot of ways
it can be used but one way is
that it can be used is to spur
on and encourage a certain
outcome and I think the values
of the majority of this body and
our governor and so on the
Senate is that we need to be
promoting programs such as this
and Representative Ferrary and
senator souls came forward with
this proposal I would also note
we enhance the proposal by not
only making it refundable we
made a transferable so if
somebody
Has what.
Doesn't need the credit because
of they don't have sufficient
income to absorb it if you want
to if I could refer to it that
way the of the ability to give
it to the installer assign it to
the or the company that's
installing the company and they
can then benefit from that Madam
speaker gentle lady.
Trying to think it we we felt
this this was great and we're
making progress in the state I
would also note that by making
it transferable and refundable
we're encouraging lower income
people to have the ability to to
to install renewable energy even
solar in in their home so for
all of those reasons we felt
that this was an of a great
enhancement to our program and
not terribly expensive in terms
of cost Madam speaker gentle
lady.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady again it goes to I think so
many of the discussions about
values and and the sort of
energy
I guess path that we're on on on
on looking at renewables and
this is.
Your cut the solar energy market
is something that is here to
stay in New Mexico and the we
would like to incentivize folks
to be able to buy into that and
we did talk a little bit about.
You know what what the process
was like in particular for
families to look at if they were
thinking.
Can I lower my energy bills by.
Possibly purchasing solar.
I'm thinking about the
refundable versus transferable
and I I like what you said
they're Madam speaker gentle
lady about being able to look at
transferring it to reinvested
into the the process of of being
able to lower those energy bills
madam speaker gentle lady so
that said we had talked about
some of the
sort of middle markets for
selling solar right now if and
some of us it's talked about the
fact that we've had someone
knock on our door saying I can
sell you a the wind farm
somewhere perhaps solar farm
somewhere and think about it on
your your rooftop minister
generally so how would this work
that sort of vetting through the
process and I know the market is
diverse and vast and I know
there's community solar being
set up right now
And then this is would this be
considered rooftop solar madam
speaker gentle lady with the can
I put a panel in my front yard
can you explain how this would
work and where we go Madam
speaker definitely it would
include what we think of as
rooftop solar solar no question
about it Hey on the other sold
sorts of I'm not madam speaker
gentle lady I am definitely not
an expert on all the variety of
ways of of gaining solar
equipment and how it's installed
sometimes it's rooftop I also
notice that sometimes
individuals madam speaker gentle
lady often have it just in their
yard and they they hook up
through that so it's not
necessarily having to be rooftop
and I imagine over time madam
speaker gentle lady that's that
the technology's going to
improve in fact speaker gentle
lady there's this start up
company in Los Alamos called
ubiquity and they've been
looking at various ways madam
speaker to advance
solar you know capturing this on
and using it as energy for the
home and they're looking at
madam speaker gentle lady tiles
so you can put you can tile your
roof and with with with these
special tiles and it collects
and it can be used as a solar
you know the an essence a solar
array and madam speaker gentle
lady that has I mean think of
the advantages one of the things
and I don't necessarily share
this but people don't like the
way it looks you know those big
things sticking up on your roof
and madam speaker so this would
be an incredibly huge innovation
madam speaker gentle gentle lady
if this should take off where
and I know that's the explored
other places but there's so many
possibilities and by having the
solar tax credit Madam speaker
gentle lady.
We you know we have the ability
to spur that on by system those
in a developing market Madam
speaker gentle lady thank you
for that item speaker gentle
lady so that said if I as the as
the industry continues to evolve
and hopefully get cheaper to
install Madam speaker gentle
lady this credit goes till
twenty thirty two so madam
speaker gentle lady at is there
a threshold in which I would
qualify for something like this
or is it just based on income
how do I qualify for this tax
credit men's regionally madam
speaker gentle lady you you have
to purchase the equipment and
then you apply for the tax
credit you'd there's no income
Measure at all involved in this
anyone who is interested in
pursuing solar for others solar
for their home has the ability
to use this I would note that
madam speaker gentle lady we
also increase the cap on the
solar credit so.
On a lease and I still have a
lot to learn but sometimes we
tapped the mouth so we budget
how much taxpayers can rely on
and it started madam speaker I I
want to say I think.
Gosh eight million as what the
original bill had madam speaker
gentle lady and our proposal is
to increase the cap to twelve to
twelve million so more people
Madam speaker gentle lady
compared to some pay and
benefits and on as a society we
are benefiting because we
spurring on alternative ways to
flee us spring on using solar
energy and by during that on
we're encouraging development of
new innovative technologies and
we're fueling if I may say Haas.
It's getting late.
See full fueling the industry so
there will be more creativity
madam speaker and more options
for us as we move forward for
renewables Madam speaker gentle
lady.
Thank you for that madam speaker
gentle lady I am so thrilled and
excited to to continue to see
the energy in the energy
industry involved in particular
renewables which is something
our community really deeply
is excited about and and wants
to continue to enhance I think
across the state in that
investment and then seeing that
help in in in households so on
and so forth is exciting which
you know I'm I've been working
on a lot of different housing
legislation and one that I think
pairs extremely well with
incentivizing some of the build
out that we would like to see in
in our community as well as the
sustainable building tax credit.
And madam speaker gentle lady
we've heard some of the push
back on you know what what we
need to to grow our state and
how to do that responsibly how
to be able to you know see where
where it is that we might be
able to grow can you talk about
you know how this sustainable
building tax credit works as an
incentive for continuing to
build housing in the state and
what it provides for madam
speaker gentle lady.
yes madam speaker gentle lady
let just give me a moment I'm I
want.
I want to find it in the bill is
it actually probably double the
size of the original bill madam
speaker because it has a lot of
com you know fairly extensive
and details provisions so.
First remember It where we
started madam speaker gentle
lady this is actually amending
the sustainable building tax
credit that we created I think
it was last year and I want to
give a shout out madam speaker
to Representative Ortez I think
she was the lead sponsor on the
bill and it was very popular
madam speaker with many people
including the builders who saw
this as a way to support their
interests in
Pursuing sustainable commercial
building activities where they
they would be able to get some
credit so for example
in the in the bill that we're
amending we find the tax credits
based on what you might even
call something that that I I
guess I shouldn't call it a
formula but what what we do so
for example for the construction
of the new sustainable buildings
that is broadband ready an
electric vehicle ready
we provide tax credits based on
the square footage and whether
it it obtains so what they call
lead platinum.
Designation in the state and the
credits per square foot of the
building is based on the rating
of the building and and and it's
how quote environmentally
friendly it is and how
sustainable it is so that's one
thing Madam speaker gentle lady
it also relates to the
renovation of commercial
buildings and for buildings that
were at least ten years old and
also it to talks about the need
for being broadband ready and
some electric vehicle ready and
you know I really want to call
this bill out for the fact that
it helps that we really need.
Broadband and and it's not just
for
You know if you'd call it a
logical reasons our system but
it's recognizing that we need to
be addressing all of these
issues on so many fronts so it
it it it it gives credits based
on you know square footage
whether or not it meets certain
standards and they very
depending on how how cold green
the building is if I may say
that I am what we did is there
but there was a gap in that we
move.
I want to say this we move the
eligibility to January one of
this year's so activities that
Kurt occurred from January this
year forward would be eligible
and there had been a gap in the
original bill and we're filling
that gap and so we add about a
year and a half or so Madam
speaker gentle lady on to the
On to the credit eligibility and
and that increase the cost a
little bit but you but not very
much so that's what that's about
that's a really innovative madam
speaker
provision in the bill which I
give credit largely to my
colleague and representative
from tiles
So I hope I hope I helped you
better understand that thank you
madam speaker thank you gentle
lady yes this this section of
the bill is is really exciting
to me because if we can start
from the ground up and I grew up
on a construction site so this
is this is thrilling to know
that if we can build it right to
begin with you lower your all of
your your bill's right enough to
come in after the fact as we
know now how expensive it is to
set up broadband retroactively
set up
you know of well insulated home
retroactively we're working to
do that but this allows you to
do that right from the get go
have these certified windows
walls insulation there are
rating your the ability to
install solar etcetera I think
this is just incentivizing the
right sort of build out that
we're looking for and really
looking at how it is that we can
have this across the board is
the standard and because we have
this tax credit available Fund
seeker gentle lady this really
looks at how we can help in
particular builders we know you
know when it comes to especially
affordable housing that high
density housing can be difficult
to make it pencil out where they
can actually make some money so
this is so exciting to to be
able to have and I hope we
continue this effort on housing
in this way in other ways and
madam speaker generally have as
I just make may add to that
again you know I just want to
reiterate Madam speaker and
gentle lady that this again like
the solar development tax credit
this is a mechanism to drive
Us in a direction and to brought
provide support for that
industry and
it's very important part of tax
policy and learning
he can be used in and I actually
businesses many times many
businesses have come to the tax
Committee asking for tax credits
to support thus and such you
know we have tax credits for jet
fuel or deductions excuse me do
you know just to support
jet fuel and when we start
talking about taking away those
deductions madam speaker gentle
lady.
The room fills up you know so
it's tricky and we do put sun
sets on these credits we put us
on there's a sunset on the
sustainable building tax credit
there's a sunset on the solar
development tax credit and so
it's very important so that we
can evaluate them.
I so appreciate that thank you
madam speaker gentle lady for
going through that with me and
and again for for bringing and
where our values are in this
bill and one of the things I
think is most exciting and truly
you the love letter that we the
the our nurses deserve is in
this income tax credit that we
have in here madam speaker
gentle lady we've we've talked a
lot about I think peripherally
about the effects of COVID on
our economy you know word
tax committee but our nurses
truly have been there on the
front lines and are still in
during so much of.
What this pandemic has brought
to that industry madam speaker
gentle lady and and our nurses
as we well know for something in
short supply in our state
minister gentle lady and I just
can you tell me a little bit
about this income tax credit and
what we're doing to try to keep
retain our our nurses attracting
new nurses to the profession
despite you know so much of the
chaos that that COVID has
created madam speaker gentle
lady Madam speaker gentle lady
on thank you for asking that
question and
You know I should say first I
have my brother is a nursing not
New Mexico but in Massachusetts
and he works at a sold we called
in soldiers homes there a state
run facility much like we have
here and he's been working there
for many years and when the cold
comment for crisis hit us and
some of those facilities are
just devastated especially
veteran facilities it was
horrendous and he was working
there and yes he did indeed get
COVID and I have fortunately it
wasn't a severe case and his
partner also works there and and
she's gotten COVID but what they
see and what I hear him talk
about is you know the watching
the the yes right price.
Watching people impassively.
And it's it's just it's just
hurt them so seen families you
know lose their loved ones and
not being able to get in so with
that is just heartbreaking and
when you're working in that
environment you've you've got a
feel with I mean the our nurses
are in the profession because
they care about people and they
want to care for them and for
them to be not be able to care
for people and to see the of the
virus you know Representative
Representative you know run
through the hospitals and cares
facilities has just devastated
our nurses and
This is our thank you to them I
know it's it's a small thank you
I don't think.
There's anything we can do
really in the terms of the tax
code to thank somebody but it is
our small way for the state to
state nurses you those of you
who have been working you will
get a tax credit for this year
just to acknowledge all the hard
work I met with some nurses
before we were before the bill
was heard and you know they they
were really fees that we were
even considering it and we need
to keep nurses in their
profession.
And this has really discouraged
many many are leaving the
profession and whatever we can
do Madam speaker gentle lady to
support them to stay and retain
them we should do it because
it's critical we are short on
health care in the state and you
know I just personally madam
speaker gentle lady want to give
the issue just shout out to the
nurses of New Mexico who toiled
for the last two years to care
for us Madam speaker gentle
lady.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady thank you for for taking in
on that I had to say yes as in
that as many as we can those
shouts from the rooftops is a
thank you for it for their
service and and this tax credit
it looks like it's a it's a one
time thousand dollar tax credit
so and I know to the one of the
challenges madam speaker gentle
lady has been that we've had to
look it travelling nurses to re
locate here into New Mexico and
hopefully they fell in love with
it hopefully this tax credit is
one of those incentives for them
to to stay and to stick with us
as well and you know when when
we think about again the values
of of what we know about you to
all of the different studies
regarding what keeps people in
in place madam speaker gentle
lady I meet a lot of the
literature I read is about
paying them what they're worth
and so madam speaker gentle lady
I think this is an excellent way
to incentivize that also just
give credit where credit is due
and in this case it's an income
tax credit and so I I I just
again want to commend you for
for adding that to this package
and.
Finally I just wanted to get
into the one part of the one
here part of this we're
I know that everyone gets a tax
break on this bill can you talk
about the point two five percent
how that works in across the
board and
however one can expect to get a
a little bit of cushion on their
taxes across the board Madam
speaker gentle lady Madam
speaker gentle lady I'll be for
first the first well I'm not the
first because others expected
tonight but really the goal is
to bring down the G. R. T.
Madam speaker gentle lady.
You know much more than a point
two five percent but to do that
madam speaker gentle lady we
need a strategy to be able to
replace those revenues and I I
recognize madam speaker gentle
lady that right now we are what
I like to say is flying high on
oil and gas revenues but those
of you who have been in the body
longer than I know and you and I
know madam speaker gentle lady
because it happened in our first
year.
The bottom can fall out Madam
speaker gentle lady we that
happened to us and I guess it
was twenty nineteen madam
speaker generally when you when
I first joined the house and we
had to come back and Sander
budget why.
Early because of COVID that's
true and and there and things
the bottom fell out of the of
the oil and gas industry but we
have seen that time and time
again and so for that reason
Madam speaker gentle lady
we put a trigger on and so on
thank you for asking that
question.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady I look forward to seeing
how this continues to evolve and
and hopefully next year if we
should we get reelected and with
that I'm just again grateful for
all of your work and I support
your bill gentleman from

Gentleman to explain the bill
thank you madam chair.
Senate bill one fifty nine is
the legislative retirement.
bill.
Senate bill one fifty nine.
Is an amended bill that this
year would raise the.
Would increase the amount.
Of the Legislative pension.
Under.
From eleven to fourteen percent.
Of the per diem rate that were
paid in the.
Here if legislators look at
Senate bill one fifty nine
you'll see there is a formula
for calculating provided
retirement the legislative
retirement fund currently is
funded at over a hundred and
forty point nine percent this
change would reduce the fund
ratio to a hundred and twenty
eight point eight percent
leaving the fund very healthy
and in that in still in over
funded state.
The amended section of the bill
would allow former and current
legislators that had not
previously enrolled in the plan
with the statutory hundred
ninety day requirement to do so
any purchase of that service
would be at the cost of what
they would have paid plus.

Senate finance committee did his
online we'll have printed
material in the chamber for
members tomorrow I just want to
make sure that for those of you
who are interested the Senate
finance committee amendment is
online I was looking at earlier
tonight there's also in the
analysis the narrative
description of what they did as
well as the breakdown of changes
that were done to each of the
sections of the bill so please
be aware that that information
is online was published it's
available but we will have some
printed material for you
tomorrow but it is quite
voluminous and we're very likely
to have a summary sheet on the

level detail it again Jack
myself this evening it is on and
we just dot gov under house bill

the items on the concurrence
calendar to Morrow also for our

start the process known as
concurrence so we will have on
our yellow counters each day
something called the concurrence
calendar those are house bills
that were amended in some way by
the Senate we'll take it up in
the same way we take a third
reading calendars we'll go
through each of the houses
Sanchez will explain what the
Senate did to the bills and then
we'll make a motion to concur
and they will urge the body
either to concur or not to
concur if we can Kerr than the
amendments are accepted by the
house in the bill goes to the
governor if we do not concur the
amendments
I will either appoint a
conference committee to work out
differences for the Senate will
receive from their budget okay
so that's how the process works
