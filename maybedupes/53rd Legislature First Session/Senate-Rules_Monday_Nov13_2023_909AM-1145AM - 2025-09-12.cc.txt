your.
Good morning Mr
chairman my name is IDC's auto
and on this I am the executive
director of the New Mexico mortgage
finance authority
Mr Baldo has been a vice
chair of our board
for a few years his
expertise and has
experience have I been very
valuable to our organization were
supportive and would be
grateful for the confirmation
of a Mr Banda thank
you thank you for your
comments anybody else in support
of the country.
Anybody not
in favor of the
country.
See none of them go
to questions from the
committee.
Any questions Senator
Ortiz Y.
Pino.
Thank you Mr chairman and thank
you Senator and and Mr
of all the for for being willing
to to serve in
in this a really important
job the
the mortgage
I I happen to be one
of
the.
Rico devise remembers
of the oversight committee
so we just met last
week in fact
and had a chance
to see what the
changes you are proposing
for the coming year
are.
And I just want to make sure the
committee is aware that
the they are
requesting.
A considerable amount of additional
money from the state
to create a fund to that would be
able to
sustain
an ongoing basis
the effort of
the mortgage finance
authority to build affordable
housing to help finance
affordable housing they're
able to take whatever money we
give them and match
it 17 to
one. So
my my question for
you the Mr Paul
though
is.
How do you as
a member of the mortgage
finance authority board
how do you see the
legislature.
Most being able to contribute
to the work of
providing
affordable housing to the
people of the state
I mean there's lots of initiative
you guys have something like 40 different
programs but of
those which of the ones that
that you would wish that we would
concentrate on and and put
our efforts behind.
Thank you senator
appreciate the question and
the you know serving
as the voice of the The New
Mexico mortgage finance
authority
you know having
the at the
authority
service all of New Mexico provides
efficiencies of scale
and.
Really
you know anything that the
the program we just recently
passed the a couple weeks ago in
our finance committee is
the down payment assistance
program that we're using some of the
housing trust funds that are
that Malek allocated for this
year
and you know with
that the economy
and in its current situation
with interest rates
have. Moving
back up to the plus 6
percent to just
making a lot of
affordable housing unavailable
for many
of our of our citizens here
in in the state of New Mexico
and so this is one program that I think
is going to help.
One use the capital that
the the the
legislature has made available
to the New Mexico mortgage finance
authority so you know
I think we're going to allocate
a pretty significant amount of
money there and it's gonna generate
somewhere between 2 to 300
homes and in in the
years time which
economic impacts about
$100000000 to
the to our economy
keep our people here in New
Mexico in the sense of
where you know
cost of living is is
important to
and
you know.
Keeping a resources
in New Mexico is important
and I think
you know continue support
for the allocation
from the trust into the trust fund
for the New Mexico more expensive
30 again this is one program
that we're being able to deploy
our modernization and maintenance
program really looking at
keeping our elders
in homes you know maybe
in in New Mexico
for the public back on
and.
Our home.
It in our elders that
it's very hard to separate them
from
their homes because the end of
this history that this use the
generations that have been
raised in those homes
and.
And and that's but
but to be a sad
thing to lose for for people
to not be able to.
Modernize traditional
homes again it's a
better
impact for the
climate in the sense that
you're not rebuilding something you're
raising 3 using something that's
been around for you know
essentially
5200 years and
and some of these cases the in some of
the other communities so
I believe continued
investment in
in
really one of the critical essential
services for
any citizen of the
New Mexico state of New Mexico
is is housing right
M. increased
ability creates
foundation and it
keeps our culture in
in place so
I appreciate the question that I answer
it I guess more
money would be the
is.
So we can do more of that
but again I know
there's a lot to go
around in the so many needs
within the state but I'm
again I think the New
Mexico mortgage finance
authority
is is working hard
and you know
when I think about the leverage ratios and I
think about the
impact we're making it and and
many.
People's lives throughout the state it's
it's it's that's why I
continue to serve and and
look forward to serving more so I
appreciate your support group
thank you Mr chairman thank
you Mr Baldo
you your as
he was excellent thank you so
much.
Senator
panics.
Thank you Mr chair and
thank you for coming forward as
a nominee
and you're already working
very hard.
My question Mr chair
is
how does the
authority.
Assist
communities in
the use of the money that
they're requesting.
Okay
sos and
MFA's intermediary
in the sense that we
we get the money and then we
break it up into multiple
parts of the oil or 40 programs
available and
then we allocated throughout the
state
so so really when when you think
about
you know our our
Camaro down payment
assistance program we use
a lot of local
resources in in throughout the
Mexico
lenders other banks
smaller financial institutions
that can get into the
communities and then
we package everything through the New
Mexico mortgage finance
authority
but but really the impact
that's a little bit easier
than you're more conventional
financing is
our ability to
find find lower
cost mortgages our
our mortgages are typically
1 to 2 percent less
than you could get from a
commercial lender so
you know in today's market you know what
you're your average
house is
costing 250 to
$310000
statewide 1 percent
is is you know
$6070
a month per $0
of value which can easily
push somebody out of affordability
especially when they're ready
that median income or or
less than because again right now we
serve somewhere between 80
percent and hundred 50 percent of the
area median income trying to
keep our our citizens it within
the community so.
So Mr chairman
I might be mistaken but does
not the
MFA
find.
More than down payment
assistance do not
provide
matching housing
funds for communities
to get into affordable
housing.
Mr chair and
centers.
You know through our
low.
Tax credit programs
we're we're leveraging
with cities
counties and governments trying
to package
together
you know.
Bundle deals to
to to get
more of the
the.
The service to the to the lower
income populations
set maybe I'm not answering
your question so it but
much Mr chair
I used to sit on the MFA
oversight many years
ago
and
perhaps their mission has
changed over the years
but I am concerned
about any funds that
might be
committed
to
community.
Housing projects
that are not utilized that
sit around for 2 or 3
years because of
problems from the
community
problems from
the developer it's
separate so
that that's where I'm what I'm
asking about okay
Mr chair
Senator
I don't believe our back pipe our
backlog is is significant
again I think with the
recent change in
inflation and
the delays of COVID
and and and supply disruptions
we've seen a little bit of
backlog but
you know all of our projects are
under way I
don't there's nothing
older than 2 years to your
money and
we haven't had many
of the tax cut its return
to the New Mexico mortgage
finance authorities I think they're pretty
efficient M. for pretty
effective
and we're not wasting
any of our
locations
so I think that being fully deployed
and actually
we've gone to a 2 year cycle
to were actually
will projecting
our projects on a forward
basis so we're
trying to get the money deployed
quicker so we can get
more impact and
reduce delays
so in my time
at the the
of New Mexico mortgage
finance authority again that's
been our performance and our
expectation is to
really
ensure that we
can.
Provide the necessary services
to those low income
citizens throughout the United States
are not yes if the New
Mexico
and I think we've
been pretty effective at
that Senator thank
you. Thank you Mr
chairman thank you for your commitment
in of this work
thank you thank you
senator.
Thank you very much Mr
chairman good morning
and congratulations
on your appointment
I think some of my questions have been
asked already Mr chair but I
wanted to make a comment interesting
that NMFA
and MFA New Mexico
finance authority in mortgage finance
authority R. really do
wonderful work in the state of New
Mexico.
Of I know that we
I think of input placing much
more
within the NMFA
on the different worker we talk
about housing
especially with the crises that we
do have with many
of our families here in the
state and
Mr chair I guess there is one question
I'd like to ask in in
getting the word out
to communities
I know you work maybe work within
of course governmental
entities but what
do you do about getting the word out
to the general populace
so that people know
how to access the
services that you
provide.
Thank you Mr chairman
Senator
you know.
We were recently going through a
rebranding
so
we've launched a 2 year
communications plan so we
can get a little bit
more
exposure again being an
intermediary but we work
through the various partners there's not
a lot of direct
contact.
In previous experience but
the gin and looking
back and maybe some of the COVID
money the housings assistants
Fund you know the state gave
us
40000000 they kept
at the going I want to say 2020
$5000000 we spend
all of ours the state then
spend the pieces they
cap so they sent us the difference
and we're able to deploy
that in service a little
over at and believe it's a
little over 20
1000
citizens in
in that
needed some COVID support so when
you think about the the
efficiencies and
effectiveness again I
think having
a team that's very
well seasoned and
and able to adjust to
the dynamics
of an economy
where you know you
had stay at home
and and
really get get
documentation together so
we can spend that money
but also be able to
pass the audit so that when treasury
came around and and came looking
to where we were the best
$60000000 go
or for an economic the
exact number don't quote me on that
but.
Again we would have
been able to do that without our
partners and
working directly with
a lot of those
grassroots organizations
that want to help the low
income and to moderate
income citizens of New
Mexico you know
bankers
no no no no
harm in it but they they they
want to do deals where
they can make
you know make
money and
there's not a lot of people that really
want to service and support
the the lower income
those that have social
issues and
meet that additional support so
again MFA is able
to really provide those
wraparound services work with
vendors Slank
some of the not for
profits that we Fund in our
projects and
I think it's it's
it's it's it's
it works
M. Senator thank
you for the question no and
I appreciate Mr chairman
Mr bother that
I think is it I think the
correct that I've seen over the years is
that we have some wonderful programs
and state government that we just don't
communicate.
And how the public can access
because I know during COVID
Mr chair I know you mentioned it to
is you know
I'm I'm sure many of us were
contacted by persons in our
communities what we do
where we go and of course
we refer.
I mean I would do so
but.
It is that getting the word out
how we utilize I guess like the
public.
Who say the I know most of
our new stations have to have
certain you know percentage
of their time it's donated
for public service announcements
so we can see
much of those I didn't at
least a
lot of that information to go
out of but
I'm just glad to hear that you were
rebranding in that you're looking
as to how else and to
communicate because Mr chair
that so most so important
about the services that New Mexico
does provide that
we need to get the word out thank
you.
Thank you senator Senator
Stewart.

is at a
healthy thing for
everybody
that's
my.
Madam and I
appreciate the opportunity to

wonderful museum.
Thank you

Good morning thanks for the option to be

important for you to for
and museum of this
level in this ability to be able to
to show kids
like you said where where the
food comes from
help support agriculture is not
just for food before you know products
that we produce here this other
half New Mexico is
the if you look at it's what
something X.
0 acres of of public
land and has mostly ranching
involved and and formats
involved that has is extremely
important to the culture our area and
to look for the option to be able to work with
this crowd and provide this resource
with state.
Thank.
Thank you Lee
right.
I appreciate being
here
N..
And just the rancher fleeing
ranch.
And it sure helped
the the
museum.
And they're doing a good
job.
Thank you thank you ranching
is important to all of us on this
committee so things would to do
any questions result but
first before we do that
is there anyone here in the
audience in favor of either
of the
conferees.
I see one if you can come up
and have a couple of
minutes state your
first and last name for the
record.
Thank you madam vice chair
Senators my name
is Jane E. again I'm with the
department of cultural affairs
my title is the constituent
liaison to our boards
commissions and foundations
and I just wanted to say
how deeply
grateful I am for the
service of this group of
people they are wonderful they have
a depth of experience
and there are
just fabulous we're very
honored so thank you
thank you anyone else
in the audience
come on
up.
Bandmates I'm also
from we adults is my
brother that we've been in
the. We've been in
the the invention Business ins
a 19 hundreds
and we're all
hallways a
willing to learn
more and I think the museum
is very important being
in education
at we need to get our kids
to see this
because we are exposed
to many students
who are not aware
of where MacDonagh
burger Guntram.
And that as a
former teacher also
have taken many of our
students to
Los crucis to visit the
museum and
it's been one of the most valuable
experiences for a lot of
those kids.
And also I do appreciate
the opportunity
to
have somebody there also
from. The
rule
Ecker extra rural
community of
warehouse.
Thank you thank you for your
comments.
Any other comments
seeing 9 anyone in
opposition of these
countries.
The national go to questions from the
committee Senator
Stewart.
Thank you Mr
chairman.
So of few weeks
ago I was able to go to
a committee at them
use them since
I've visited there several
times it's so
beautiful it's
so
big.
We you know we
we have this you know 9 to
5 issued chopped up
work all day
I didn't get enough of a
chance to look at the
museum much as I
wanted to but I'm
just so
impressed by
the what what
you do down in the museum
and heritage aspect
of our life here.
However
I want to know if any of
you know about
or interested in our
thinking about
having an
exhibit you
know certainly it's an
educational you sent
it it's just unbelievable
having an an
exhibit on
pollinators the
importance of pollinators
to your crops
up what you do to
promote them
what kids can do
to promote them
it's a very important
understanding that I don't
think that all kids
understand
you know bees is
what keeps those crops
coming onto our
table
so
I just think it's an important
aspect of agriculture
that perhaps we haven't
talked about enough and
I'm just wondering if we
can have some type
of exhibit in that
museum about
pollinators
importance
how you keep pollinators
alive the plants we
have incredible
indigenous plants that
keep those pollinators
going so
I don't know if anybody wants to comment
about
that.
Yeah sure actually we
are one of things a discussion right
now is looking at a pollinator
garden in order to
route rebuilding there in the front
of the museum so yeah we're
we try to look at those issues
also.
Right well thank you Mr chairman
it's it's it's more
important than people realize
you know if we get rid of the fees
we don't have food in about 4
years so think about 4
years.
I want to still eat fruit
Melanson
you know strawberries and all
of that tomatoes
so the importance
of pollinators I think
it's really got to
be elevated in our
equipment and so thank you
Mr chairman.
Senator Ortiz Y.
Pino. Thank
you Mr chairman and the
Senator Stewart maybe you
should propose a
memorial about
pollinators.
With you did a few years
ago the
only 4 or
5 times plus
several bills and
I'm gonna rely on them to
educate our children.
It's good of so
thank you Mr chairman and and thank
you all for being willing to survive
I just a couple of
of. Questions
mostly a curiosity more
than anything.
With the 2 of you from
we are just here
today.
What is the population of
this with you here.
What you'll have to
echo
2004.
That's good.
It's great earn of if
if we've ever had anybody from
Leo's testified in the committee
but it's great to have a 2 in one day
this is quite a remarkable
feat
so Mr chairman
my other question is for Mr
Mayberry and and this is
again idle
curiosity
you mentioned the artesian well
the need to use to
to. What
are your feels with
is that throwing water from
the from the
same
are preferred the local
all of that that we were
so concerned about all over the
eastern part of the state in the
western part of Texas.
Right know the artesian
basin we use is that Rossell
artesian basin to different
base and it draws out of Sacramento
mountains.
And it is
the first
base in New Mexico to actually be
meter back in the early
sixties and
we've kept the water level
where it needs to be.
Thank that was gonna be my follow
up question so what's what's happening
with the water level but it sounds really
good 3 well thank
you all for being willing to
serve I haven't
been down there in about
10 years we had a committee meeting
there about 10
years ago and it was a fascinating
but I think it's been developed even
more since and so
sometimes I hope to be able to
get back to thank you Mr
chairman.
Thank you Senator
Duhigg thank you
Mr chair.
Excuse me I
don't I don't have COVID
problems
I also was
with us Senator Stewart at
that meeting at the farm and
ranch museum and the first
time I'd ever been and I was so
impressed by it but but
Mr chair I'm gonna thank
your indulgence a little bit
because I Mr
Conrad.
I know you're here
about.
Of this board but while
I have you I have a
question I have a question
for you yes ma'am
you're the CEO of Mountain
View regional yes
Representative. Now
I know there's a pending lawsuit
about this so I'm not asking
you to tell me
anything about a pending
lawsuit
but.
My my very first
session I
possibilities real proud of
called the patients debt
collection
protection act correct
and I know that there
is currently a lawsuit pending
against Mountain View for
not
following that
act on and
setting low income patients
to collections
in violation of that
act so
and I know that you did not come here
today prepared to answer any questions
that are just
but to the extent
that you can tell me what what can you
tell me that Mountain View regional is
doing now to
ensure that they are complying with
the patients that collection protection
act
so.
The to the to the best of my knowledge
I don't believe
that we are doing that at all it's been
complete suspended
sense.
Whatever this interaction was part of
I don't of those before my time or
what this aware of a lawsuit I
don't I don't think it
happened since
I've been here solely so all of that
has been suspended
coming does not practice that anyway shape
before moving forward
you know we have had multiple resources
at the hospital anybody
that has any trouble paying with anything we
have financial
advisors on site that we make
available to them 247
it's not something that happens in
these conversations are ongoing
for months and years
before
it before you ever get to the point
where accounts go to
collections so
it's yeah that
that's the most I can I think going
to a today without having
you know having the distance of the case
but but that is not a practice of the
facility use
anymore and Mister chair
Mister Conrad I'm I'm very happy
to hear that that
practices not continuing
and I also hope the
any.
Any suits that were filed
against lowincome New
Mexicans well that practice was
happy I hope that those have been dismissed
at this point.
Thank you Mr.
Thank you Senator
Lopez.
Thank you very much Mr chair
and thank you to each of you for your
willingness to serve we all
have another life.
Outside of
you know what you're committing
to continue working
on with regards to this
particular museum.
And Mr chair remember when
it first opened.
Yes and it was I
think the dream of where
it is at this point in time it's
so wonderful to see the facilities
how it's grown
I know my kids and I haven't been there for
a few years but we have made
and make sure to stop by and
take a look at in
a very few posted some wonderful
meetings and events there appears
to but it's good to see how it
is and progressed over
time one
question Mr chair.
When we talk about getting the word
out specifically about how
important agriculture is
to our state and
it is it's imperative we if we
look back from where we were
back in many a couple
centuries ago still moving
forward over time with
sheep cattle
and everything else that we have
and also the agriculture
does the do you
all work with like a pretty good
to the network which
of course is you know looking as
to sustaining a
small farms throughout
the state is there any involvement
with with the Board
or with the
museum itself
about.
Reserving educating our young
people and working with the
small farms across the
state Mr
chair.
We'll certainly try to work
with everyone across
the state we do a lot
of.
It you know looking into how
do we tell different stories of our
state that goes from
the from the pueblos through
the Spanish period
through
today and there's all
sorts of different things involved in
that.
The.
I can't think specifically of looking
at small farms
you know right now that certainly
something we are aware of
and and look at I'm involved with
another program
The New Mexico 8 leadership
and we do a lot of work with small farms
urban ag and we come down
the kirke you know we always
have. The point
of searching out urban a
look at how that works and the coops
and and those sort of things
because.
It's growing it's becoming
a bigger part of of what our food
chain is
and.
I don't know of anything in the works right
now to explore the small
farms in our museum but that's
certainly on the table
I mean it's as
you know there's a certain
amount of resources in a certain amount of
time and it.
We we want wrestling things at once
we know that something that
would definitely most interested
in and and.
You know the presentations
on and and some displays
on.
Thank you Mr chair that I
I appreciate you sharing that
because small farms also
encourages
younger persons
to get into.
Are self sustaining
smaller farms to produce
of if it's produce or
whatever it may be
but I know that is
kind of the movie that that I'm
aware of of especially
to encourage those in that middle age
range twenties thirties
forties about the
value that you
get your hands dirty
there's nothing wrong with it I've always
told Mr chair
a person's when I go speak is
that we are people of the
earth right
and to have your hands
get dirty there's nothing wrong
with that because it also
has a sense of
I called another level
of spirituality but it it
connects us to the earth
which is I know that the businesses some
of you have been in
and what we're trying to encourage our young
people because without.
Ag without
agriculture
I don't think we exist
so thank you Mr
chairman.
Thank you and I just want to thank all of you
for what you do if I have a
couple of questions do you by
any chance team up with
local FFA
students to come up with
the exhibits were to listen
to their side of the story
and incorporate what teenagers
might be thinking about when it comes to
farming and
ranching.
We have for a 2 years
now brought in
the 4 H.
kids and they do
a full day of exhibits
and displays for some of the
projects and we work
with if a as much as we
can. As
you know they do their state
judging. In
our state annual meeting in Los
crucis always and we try to
have something
going on for them whether it's
a. Just
get them out there for the day look around
or or to be involved in part
of that we don't
have a chapter right now it comes
out health was some landscaping
you know and into
projects such as that
of.
One the problem work with 4 H. and
FFA is they're busy.
Those kids are I spent
a lot of time practicing
and doing contest
and and we leadership
things and.
In their place are full already
you know but we yeah we certainly
try to partner with them because we see
that as a
you know the the future generations
gonna be supporting what we're doing at
that facility
thank you for that then
just my last comment as we've
been to a lot of local schools
lately that are saying farm to
table so things
students are doing farms
within their own school community
and then giving about bounty
either to senior centers
or to their cafeteria
to incorporate into
their their
menus at school so it's nice
to see that farming and ranching
is even making its way into
urban school settings
Senator Stewart and I got to see
one this past
summer to see that was a
middle school right in Albuquerque
that's doing farming
right in their own backyard
so with that what is the will of the
committee.

The folks are and then you also serving

Thank you for that good morning Mr
chair of course madam
chair members of the Senate
rules committee it
is indeed a pleasure to be here
with you this morning
and to present to you
of the
nominees if you will for the
board of trustees
of the minors hospital
located in recto
New Mexico
Mr chair how would you
like to proceed.
You can go ahead and introduce
all 3
collectively of then I'll give them
each a couple of minutes to
address the committee
thank you very much Mr chair
so I'll go ahead and I'll go according to
the list that has been
provided the
first is going to be Dr
Loretta Conder who
is seeking
appointment if you will to
the board of
trustees
the individuals that are going to be
presented to you
today I
know them personally and I know of
the hard work that
they have put forth not only in the
area of rent to own but in southern
Colorado and northern
New Mexico.
In order to provide the best
healthcare of the
best quality of life for
the people of that
region and of course
those that occupy or those
that have used if you
will the minors hospital
so the first of course
is Loretta
Dr Loretta Conder
with that she's eminently
qualified she
has a quite a
few credentials in terms
of her
education her
certification
her employment and
one of the issues that
are bring forth with
her nomination
is that she is highly
devoted to health care
and as we move forward
allow them the opportunity
to present their
credentials in a
further fashion
the second Mr chair members
of the Senate rules committee
is Roy P.
for non this
and Mr Fernandes
in
past years has served on
the minors hospital
one of the issues there has
been that he'd never missed a
meeting he was
very committed of course to the
hospital to the services
that were provided there
and he has been very
much involved in
the community of about to on
the county of Colfax
and within the region he is a
very devoted individual
when it comes to
health care when it comes
to community life
and most importantly
to helping if you
will the individuals
of continue
with the best services
possible at the
minors hospital.
The last individual
that I would present in
terms of the credentials would
be Jolene Francis
green.
Mr chairman members of the Senate
rules committee another
individual who has been
strongly devoted
to the community of
rat tone the county of
Colfax who
continues to serve if you
will in this capacity is a
community facilities
manager but
over the years she has
a great background in
food service
leadership marketing
marketing team
building and
most importantly continues
to work with the environment
you may say well with the
credentials of these
3
what would be if you will the
focus and the
future for
the minors hospital
these individuals are fully
invested in
health care within the
region the hospital
continues to be very
successfully run
operation and
with these appointments
are I really believe
that the future of the
minors hospital will continue
to serve the needs
of not only the miners
but other individuals who
utilize the facility with
that Mr chair
madam chair and of course members
of the Senate rules
committee would be
if you we could would allow them
to make a few
statements on their own behalf at
this time thank you senator
couples will start off with Dr
Loretta
conjure.
So I've
been.
In red town now I came in
1991 I
joined another group of internists
there
I am board
certified in internal medicine
I completed my
internship and residency
at UNM
in
1991
so I practice my home medical
career in rat
tone.
I.
Retired from patient
care last year but I continue
as an associate member of the
medical staff serving
on the credentials
committee and the
provider performance
evaluation committee which is our
queue a queue I committee
and I'm pleased to
present money at
self for the
board of trustees I
feel like I bring
historical perspective
and knowledge and
experience that will serve the
board well.
Thank you for your comments
Roy Fernandes.
Good morning.
Again my name is Roy Fernandes
of from born and raised
in rat tone I worked in the
for work in the coal mines in
1976
until 1989
so I for quite a bit
underground in the coal mines
when you're out on the strip
and then I ran for a position with
the United mine workers of America
and I was the auditor and
the organizer
for that you
of for 33
years I just retired
a year point 5
ago.
And I got on is
a county commissioner as
this Senator Campos mention
earlier and I just
finished my second term
for 8 years in
December
and.
Fully retired I thought
an opening came up so I thought of
while I was on the board
before 13 years ago
and I'm gonna try to
serve and help my
community again in the
miners Colfax Medical
Center with the
experience and expertise
that I've had in the years
when I held a position
as a trustee for 13
years
so I'm very honored
and pleased to be here
I want to thank you all in space
Senator Campos for
being our sponsor here today
thank you thank you
the lingering.
Good morning thank you for having
us today
I.
As Senator
Campos noted I
actually started out as a
dietary aid in as I was
15 years old and worked
up to nursing home
administration so I'm currently
a licensed nursing home administrator
for 3 years at the
miners Colfax long term care
there and so have
really good structure
between the hospital and the long term
care this
opportunity came up and I
was actually approached by one of the
county commissioners announced
2 appointments
or play for the board this
position so I did
that I think that I
bring a lot of experience
on both sides of the
fence if you will
having the background of long term care
is as well as working at the
hospital
in understanding health care itself
so sometimes
I'm the person who creates the harbor
on the board and that's okay
because that makes it
means we're paying attention to what's
going on so.
Thank you for your comments anyone
of the committee in favor
of either one of the
having anybody in the
audience in
favor of any of these countries if
you can come forward to state your first
and last name for the record
please.
I just want to Senator
Campos if you can turn your Mike up
please for him thank
you.
Mr chairman members of the
committee.
Both sit
down.
Okay.
Mr chairman members of the
committee as
a property
owner in the
community
and someone who
has a background also on health
services
delivery for the last 40
years I was so
excited to
see the appointment of these
3 individuals
doctor conger of excellent
physician miss grain
excellent health services
administrator
and Mr Fernandes
a very uniquely
qualified individual
who has a background
not only
in.
As a member of
the board in the past but
also as a minor
and someone who has
pushed
for
of the the
community have a facility
that will be sustained
and the long term
he self serving
he does not self serving
self he is committed to
the institution
all of them are and
it's uniquely qualified
to provide services
for our our
child so thank
you so much thank
you for your comments anybody else
in favor of either one of these
3.
C. line is there anyone
in opposition of any of
these 3 countries.
Okay seeing not I'll go to the
committee Senator
Ortiz Y.
Pino.
Thank you Mr president thank you
all for for
continuing your service to the
community in this fashion it's
it's really great to see
what I'm. Right
background you each bring to
this so
I I know this is still one of the
vacancy on this board
and and one
person that will I guess couldn't
come is that way we only
have 3 of the 4
because there's somebody
else who's supposed
to.
Shawn Jeffrey agency mission
Jeffrey we'll see them
in January.
Okay so
my question for you really is
if each of you could just
in a nutshell
give us some idea of what you see
is the biggest issues
facing the
hospital.
In this provision of health
services in the in the
Colfax area
Colfax County area and
what we as legislators might
be able to do about that
so maybe we just go right on
line from Mr Fernandes
sure thank you
senator thank you all
Senator penal one
of the things that we're one of the issues that
we're facing right now is
you know we're one of the very
few hospitals
that deliver
babies
and that's what one of the
issues that we're facing right now
that we're gonna be asking
the legislature for some help
on that because
of I don't even think Las
Vegas
hospital delivers
babies we've been
delivering for many many
years and and
continue to do that and it's it's
a it's something that needs
to be continued
of the problem
areas we lose about
$2000000 a year
delivering babies we
don't get paid a whole lot of money for
Medicare Medicaid
the majority of the the
women young girls are having
babies or their
Medicaid and we don't
get a whole lot of reimbursement of
Medicaid so lose quite
a bit of money there so we're
gonna be us the
legislature some point
I think we've got some conversations
already with the with the
governor's office
to help us on that and she's very
interested in and making
sure that we continue to deliver
babies there in our
hometown we have a
very good staff
there's been doing that for many years
and so
that's one of the one of the major
issues that we are facing right
now that one of the other
issues that we're looking at also
is is our
we have a clinic
and we're we're debating
and we're looking into whether
or not
we should make that a rural
clinic
we found out our
last meeting actually that
are reimbursement
of doubles
if it's a rural clinic and it's not
a real clinic right now
apparently we lost some paperwork
or something did happen
there of during
the pandemic
with COVID.
And so we're looking into that right
now we need to find
out exactly
if we my understanding
in reading
165 pages last
week on how you become a
rural clinic is
we need to make sure that
our our numbers
are over 50 percent
of patients through Medicare
Medicaid to do to
make that determination whether or not
we become a rural clinic so those are the 2
big biggest issues that
we are facing right now I believe
just as board of trustees at the
hospital our
hospital.
Thank
you.
Thank you senator
chair we
will just you know reiterate which
were I said is there some challenges
you know being a frontier
hospital
and also a nonprofit
hospital you know
your focus is to
provide is for good quality
here as you can and it's not
always about reimbursement
however reimbursement is
important there
are some funds that come from
the minors trust to the
hospital to be
dispersed for various
I you know items out
there and then the rest of it is
really for billing
that we find out
to private health insurance
and sometimes most of it is
Medicaid so
that is our biggest challenge is
just making sure that we have enough
funds to keep things going in the
right direction
I I recently resigned
from the city I was working
with the city on economic
development this hospitals
the key piece
to
economic development in
the community is
part of our structural
components that we need to have in
place in order to draw people
to our area
that in our schools are our major
focus at that point in time
so this
hospital is important to our
community we want to make sure we
continue to keep moving it
forward.
I would like to echo
Senator.
To what Mr
Fernandes said
OB services are very
important we have a
board certified OBGYN
physician and a family
practice doctor
who does
obstetrics who are the
medical
providers
we have a good OB nursing
staff all the cost
of the travelling nurses
especially for obstetrics
became hi
and has remained
high. As
a physician member I'm
I'm recruiting
new providers to
the to our small
hospitals very important
more and more primary care is being
delivered by mid level
providers which and they're
very good
providers
that's a challenge it's hard
to get physicians who want
to live in a rural area live
where they work we've
done a good job with our
emergency room physicians
many of them do come
from
outside
areas work
a few shifts and go home
but
improving
the quality of care
in our hospital is something
I would like to be very involved
in with the
committee I serve on at the
hospital and on
my board
position.
Thank you thank you for your answers
at that Mr Chairman
at the
Ruidoso meeting of
the Legislative
interim health and Human Services
Committee of
the administrator of the
right dose of hospital was
explaining
why they lose
so much money he said they
lose
$9000 every
time they have a delivery.
Or is this a coral hospital
loses $22000
with every delivery and
that's because they have more deliveries
in Ruidoso
and when you have a OBG
land service like the
deliveries.
You have to have staff there
all the time you can't
have people who
when you call them up maybe out of
town that mean they have to
be there and so
they're they're they're occupied all
the time it really
is financially feasible
if they're there and
they're going 3
for 5 days without any
deliveries.
You have no revenue coming in to
cover those expenses and that's
not just the drive that's the
nurses all the
other person that are
needed to make sure the
deliveries are safe
and then when they do come there's 3 or
4 and 1 in 1
weekend and and all of a
sudden they're incredibly busy
so you can not
do it and yet you lose
money when you do it
and this is the dilemma
that the state is going to be
facing and all already
the northeast quadrant you're the
last right here the
last house bill less
Vegas doesn't have
it.
2 can carry I don't think
as it then I don't know
if I don't clean even
as a hospital deserve hospital
including but they don't have
it either
so.
We've got to figure out a way to do
it and it may be my
own thought is we need to
be maybe just
be willing to bite the bullet
and and pay for
it because
the other alternative is is
a much more extensive
utilization of
midwives
certified midwives who can
be out there doing it but
you still have to have the hospital as a
backup for the emergency
so it's a huge dilemma
is going to cost us money but
I really am glad you highlighted
that for us here thank you so
much one last
question Mr chairman for
ms green I I
did not realize you had a long
term care facility there
as well.
Yeah it is actually housed in the
original hospital it was built
in 1904
that was remodeled
sometime ago back in
1998 and it's
a 43
bedroom nursing home
unit it's actually
kind of nice it's very
it's basically there
for minors who
are needing long term care
services and we
also provide
services for Medicaid
it's not a skilled facility
so there's not chair
happens in there however
they usually do that at the hospital
in the swing bed area
and then once they're ready to
transition into a long term care
setting they do come
over to the
facility.
Miss Mister chairman is it
full
I believe right now the census
is 26.
We we also visited
the meadows home
it is the
facility in Las Vegas
which is gorgeous
beautiful facility
but 2 wings
one of which is shut down because they
don't have enough staff
so how are you dealing with
and the staff shortage it
was not necessarily for the medical
and nursing it was for
the care attendants the
the the direct service
personal care
attendants are you having
that same problem of course
everybody is so I mean again
it's it's a rural
community
pre COVID I will tell you
that yeah we were pretty
well staffed and didn't have any
issues did
very well in keeping COVID out of
the facility for 18
months until they
were ready to have visitors start
coming back in and
hello it
showed up on the floor for
us of course
yes I mean the challenges
nursing in it and it's
it's at the hospital as well
as the long term care
so and not all travelers
are interested in coming to a
long term care setting
so that's another challenge that
we of course have to try
to overcome as
well.
Which brings up Mr chairman serve
a couple more quick questions for
you about that
the.
It is there and is there nursing
program anywhere near that you're seeing
education program anywhere near
so we do do there is
we do work with the high school
on the CNA program
there is a nursing program
across the border in Colorado
and internet actually
and we do Garcia
and at the hospital
actually teaches in that in
those classes so she
kind of you know
brings over those that she
can so hello
doctor conger kind of tap
on that a little bit.
Yes Trinidad
state junior college has
a nursing program and
the students specially said are
CNO.
Rhonda money as involve
with trended
state junior college so we
do have nursing students
to come over
and
I would say that's probably
a funnel for most of
our younger
younger with
the COVID we lost some of our
I see universes who could
become travelers go out get
paid more money
so you know
you're it's it's
just the unending circle
you have to pay more money for
people to come in from outside
and you lose your local people who
leave to go work
somewhere they can make more
money.
During the COVID Mr chairman
we heard stories of
nursing staff from Alamogordo
becoming travelling nurses
and replacing the Los crucis
nurses who would become
travelling nurses in
Alamogordo.
And everybody got
a lot more money.
Except the hospital couldn't
afford I mean it just it
was the the.
Very strange situation
with that thank you thank you for being
willing to serve and really
appreciated thank
you senator Senator Stefanics
thank you Mr chair I'll be
brief
piggybacking on center
to see Pino
would one of you at
least comment
on
immediate.
Issues or problems
that you will encounter
I know you talked about the health care
workforce but is there
anything else that.
Is rising to the top right
now. I'm gonna
say financially
denials from some
of the for Medicare
and some of the Medicare advantage
plans have been
hard to overcome
and I'm gonna I'm
saved. Can't
of course any names
but just trying to
get.
Just trying to get paid
for what we do and these
are coders and
billers spend a lot of time
on the Niles which is
unfortunate
the Medicaid reimbursements had
been cut hopefully those
will.
We'll see some more money coming
in from there but
with a higher overheads
and even you pay
vendors
if you want electronic billing
you pay vendors what is
it 3 percent
so those you know that can add
up to tens of thousands of
dollars every month so
costs are rising reimbursement
is falling in
and of.
Remaining with financially
stable is becoming more
and more of a challenge.
Thank you very much.
Thank you Senator Duhigg
thank you Mr chair have
a question for on the
screen because I I
see that you also serve
on the the
board of nursing home
administrators
yes.
So if if an
issue involving the minors
hospital was to come before
the board of nursing home
administrators how would you
how would you deal with that what would you do
I would actually have to recreate
cues myself
obviously I've
actually been working with
the the licensing
for you know anyone coming
and so I always try to help
out as I can
on that website because with
the expedited licensure that was
passed last year that actually helps
out tremendously
especially when you're looking at
people coming in from out of
state.
Thank you.
Thank you for that any other

think there are a tremendous
asset to the world
culture as well as
in the United States and in New
Mexico
and having worked
in the field I'm also very proud
of what people in museums
do one of
the great attributes of
museum work is the
fellowship the people
in museum field
with one another they're always
ready to assist
each other

professional expertise and
also first full

opportunities support
museums is is a

fairly new to
my position as executive

2 individuals.

and.
James Bryant science
communication

incredible resources that I

Chair Hermio
Senators my
name is Jane Egan and the
secretaries liaison to
boards commissions and
foundations and
in that role I spend
of the great deal of time
going to board
meetings and I can also tell
you that the natural history
museum exciting
dynamic we are
very very
fortunate.
To have these 2 gentlemen joining
the board and I
stand in full support thank
you thank you for your comments
anybody else in the audience
in support of the country's.
I see none anyone in
opposition of either 2
of the
country's.
Signal go to the committee
for question Senator Ortiz
the people.
Thank you Mr chairman and
and I notice both
here or reappointed
to the board you you've been serving
on the board
could you share with
us.
Your own view
of of what the biggest
challenge facing
the the museum
might be at this time
and and if there's
things that the legislature are
no that would be helpful to
us in
helping you respond to those
challenges.
Begin
I would
consider the
natural history museum
to be a
diamond.
But a diamond in the
rough.
The physical way
out science
changes very
quickly.
There are there
are.
Opry's and and
plans to
make changes but you can
never make too many changes
in the field of changes so
quickly and
deals with so many
children were you have an
opportunity have community
outreach.
The amount of field trips
at this museum receives
is absolutely
astounding and something
that I
I think is is incredibly
valuable.
Provided to
the.
Well all those things cost
money.
And
as a businessman
I am always
very much
attuned.
To how to
be certain if the money is well
spent.
It does point to physical
plant general upgrade
the flow of the museum
all these things would
certainly
require
additional
funding.
I think it's important to note
that amongst
all the various
museums and historic sites
that there are in New Mexico
and there's so many it's a real
real galaxy
of of
resources
I understand the museum
of natural history and science is the
most heavily attended
museum in the
state of so
certainly do all of that comes
with the sort of expenses
that this for
reference but I think
also the that there is
it's it's there's a huge
opportunity
for the role of this
museum increases the
flagship institution
for the study of
natural history and science
in the state the
resources of the state is
from much of the world just
discovered are incredible
in terms of nature
outdoor recreation
the cultural aspects
of of nature and
more and more so
the the extent to which
the the
state leadership can
encourage collaboration
with and support
for the
museum
from all of these other
agencies that have shared
interests I think would
be very valuable so in
other words it it
while the extra money that
might be available as Bob
references it of course is it
is very very important
the collaboration.
In the in many ways cost
nothing and the
so the to see these
other state
agencies
shake hands with the museum
and and make its mission
just that much more
successful
I think would be very
valuable.
Well thank you both very much for
being willing to serve in Mr
chairman thank you so much
thank you Senator
Lopez.
Thank you very much Mr chairman
thank you to both of you for your
willingness to give up of that extra
time like we all have
extra time right
the 2 willingness to service truly
appreciate it thank you
I just wanted to is you know
say that I've had a chance to
visit over the years with my
children. And
they have always enjoyed as I
have to as
a chaperone
for the kids so we've gone there
for for field
trips but I I
know it's very
even for myself funding
going to require
that the
children get to go into the room
and actually hold
a tarantula or
whatever maybe and it's just
I stand away of course
but I enjoy
watching the children
interact I'm
not one to do that
type of holding
but. I
know that in the past Mr
chair you know there's been some issues
with leaks on their you know
from from the roof
and some other issues
have has
that.
Been addressed on the physical
building itself Mr
chair
I know that that was one of the initial
issues a few years back and
I know that I haven't had a chance to
to hear back on on
the status of some of those repairs
that were made
and if it's safe again
you know for the
what for
the work that
and what what
is provided and shown
in there the
facility.
Right I know that there
are there are still many
I'm going issues
okay.
Mr
chair.
It in us some of your
the the persons in charge
of the institution
are there any requests coming
to us this year
for some of those needs
physical physical
plant
needs.
Yes Mister chair if I
could.
Sure.
Senator thank you for your
question yes there are some
needs that bill it
we are an old building
we have
addressed.
Today if the roof isn't
leaking so we have fixed all
the leaks that we know we
have
we are in the midst
of actually reimagining
about 4000 square feet of
new exhibit space
we are our our
buildings not
leaking and so we're
taking the time to renovate
the long
overdue parking lot
issues so that we will
have much
smaller.
Bottles when it
rains
but yes we have more
requests
coming for the
session.
For infrastructure.
I just want an Mr chair and
thank you so much because
this is an area it is it
is a shining star for our
state and I know many
children but adults to come
in like to go and learn especially
when there's new services such to
go and visit and the theater
is always fun to go watch
different movies and
stuff I I always enjoy
that
but I just want to say thank you
for.
The maintenance maintaining
also bringing in
new exhibits for the children
and adults to learn from
it's it's very exciting Mr chair
as we learn more about
the presence of humans
here with the New Mexico and
looking at the the
different you when
you drive around you talk about
and look as to how fast
we are but what this place was
before from a desert now as to
what it was so many
centuries past
it's amazing to think about
and it's very interesting Mr chair as
we specially talk about our
children to learn more
about New Mexico because we
always to look like this is just part
of that that history that we
do need to to learn
about and not just missed
not just children Mr chair but
adults need to learn to
thank you very much and thank
you. Thank
you Senator
Stewart.

I that I did not take
money students

is talking about is an incredible
room where you go in and it's
all hands on

much fun
to actually pick
up also some look
at him up close

that tarantula.
And torrential as you know they
molt so sometimes

trustees the reappointment of
Margaret Allison
Senator Brenda McKenna is
your Senate sponsor senator if you
can come up thank
you.
Good morning
senator.
Good morning Mr
chairman
please to
sponsor miss
marg Elliston who
is a fellow
Carell as Kerala's
community member
I nominate her to continue
her service to the New
Mexico.
Children's trust fund
board she's
a dedicated public
servant to one of
the most vulnerable
communities in
our state and that is
to children.
She receives
great satisfaction for
what she does as a child
advocate and has
done so for over 40
years.
Beyond ms Ellis
Stine's purse professional
accomplishments
she is well known in the
community and New
Mexico
for volunteering
time and time again
and is certainly known
for one who
is.
At known for
giving and sharing
and with that
Mr chairman and committee
members I
present miss Elliston
to you. Thank
you good morning good
morning some nice to see
so many friendly faces
here I
Margo assistant and I
was really grateful to be
appointed to the board of the
children's trust fund 4
years ago by our
governor Michelle Lujan
Grisham and
I was excited by the
opportunity because the trust
fund had been pretty
inactive for the past
4 years and we had
money to spend
also we
wanted to get out we wanted
to get it out to the communities as
quickly as possible because
community as you well
know communities are
struggling with how we take care
of our kids and how we
keep them out of harm's
way so that's
that's the ongoing
challenge in New Mexico
and the children's trust
fund is just one little
cog in in the way we
can really support
communities and families
so
we issued a
request for proposal
for the money that we had
and we got
we had.
About $400000 a
year to offering
grants we got
proposals from 19
organizations asking
for
1.$8000000
I mean there's a huge
desire in New Mexico
for this funding
and not enough of it to
go around so I'm still
plugging away at the children's trust
fund trying to
gather more resources so we
can distribute them to communities
and I'm really hoping
that you'll help and
reappoint me as well as
help to get
some more funding
into the trust fund it is
a trust fund we have an
endowment we
also
have. Revenue
from the sale of our cute
kids license plates
I have a picture and
also from the
sale of of where
the marriage license
fees the
license plate of marriage
license fees
but both of those
revenue streams are pretty
depressed during the pandemic
and so we need some
more help
to build up our trust.
Thank you.
Anybody in the in the
room in the committee
room in
favor of the
country.
Anyone here in
opposition.
Signal go to the committee for
questions and
comments.
Senator Ortiz Y. Pino
thank you Mr chairman and and thank
you of the Senator
for bringing a more
forward and thank you mark
for for wanting
to to continue doing
this up
we we are going to be
in we I hope
endorsing
legislation seeking in
the.
If the Legislative Health and
Human Services Committee
seeking the extra money
for the.
For the trust fund and for the
next Gen fundus well
so your
requests not following
the fears know how
far it gets is another
matter but we
are going to ask for it and I think
it would be a very
valuable my question
Mr chairman is to
what extent is is the
current CYFD
administration the
support of the work of the trust
fund and and our communications
going with.
A quick question
we we have up
so the trust fund is
attached to the CYFD
in were placed in
the.
Prevention bureau
of protective services
that whole organization as
some of you know is
under
transformation
reorganization
and we've gotten really
good support from the
folks in the prevention
bureau we're
we're training a new
person that's assigned
to us and then the the
folks above her are committed
to our.
Proposal and and the
activities that we do
that they're all kind
of well
there's lots going on at CYFD
that they're running fast to
try to keep up with and
we've we've had a talk with the
governor and with the
secretary of CYFD
about our request
they said
good idea and come
back well thank you know
later so we're
trying to talk to the secretary
again but any help you can
give us would be helpful as
well.
Thank you thank you.
Thank you Senator
Lopez.
Thank you excuse me thank
you very much Mr chairman
and just wanted to say
thank you our work
for continuing to give
back to our community
you have given so much over the
years and the work that you've done
in many different.
Areas of our state
but I know.
The the children's trust fund I think
has a special place
in.
In in our state and we
do always need more
support monies especially
and it is not for the big programs
but sometimes it's for the smaller
programs in
not just Albuquerque the Rio Grande
quarter but other places
outside of the
the corridor they do
need some assistance even
if it's a few dollars those
dollars they do stretch
on Mr chair and it
does make a difference for
services.
That are so needed Mr
chair and I know that we've we've heard
so much in
senators TCP knows committee
with the health and Human Services over
the years we
have a dearth of lack of
money even
though we have a big chunk of change for
the state but
we still talking about how it trickles
down to small communities
I think that is also
where this
particular
money and support that
you all can give us a big
difference so
I just wanna say thank you for what
you and and your fellow board
members to thank you Mr
chair. Thank
you Senator Duhigg.
Thank you Mr chairman
I just I want to echo Senator
Lopez is thanks
and. Not
only for what you're doing on this board but
for what you've done for our state
for many many years
I am very concerned
though about the first
reference that you listed
of Toni Martorell
ones I'm
cases she's my sister in
law.
That's it thank you so much for all
your service.
Thank you Senator
Stefanics.
Thank you Mr chair and
thank you for coming forward again
mark for
volunteering
we've known each other the other
over the years and you to step
up when it's needed
my question though
is.
Senator Tom Rutherford and
many others were involved with the
children's trust fund
license plate
could you tell us if
there is any significant
revenue that comes from
that.
Yes thank you the US
Senator.
We get about that.
$50000
a year or so from
that
part one of the issues with the
license plate is we we have
more competition now there's
lots more vanity plates
but it's a good deal
I have one and
I just got a of.
Of re issue
because mine was all faded
and so it it adds
a lot as it to our foreign
cars but the license
plate the revenue
is.
It's helpful it's not huge
out let me just say that and we
we have a great marketing
committee made up of our
board that they're working on
trying to get into all the
auto dealers and the
MPD places
to publicize the
license plates more we
have some handouts were
putting up in
places where people get license
plates so
that we can advertise a little
more and generates more
revenue. Thank you
the reason I asked Mr
chair I've had
one from the beginning but
then I
asked for a report
of how the funds are
being spent
and nobody ever answered
me and this is several years
ago and so
when it expired I
let it go
and I
am hopeful that
we can
generate interest in
it and also
publicize how the funds are
being used well
yes.
Mister chairman Senator Stefanics
yeah we have I'd have to
give you this
impending.
The 0 now okay
and we have a report about the
we're funding center
I don't know if you want this.
Great and then you can sign up
again and you'll get a perhaps
I can number

committee my name is Oscar ladies
and the chief financial officer for the New
Mexico finance authority
we are very happy
to
support of and
these of the appointment to the
board he came on
board in 2019 is the as
he was pointing out of
at about the time
of that the pandemic hit
and the state look to
the NMFA to to
move a lot of money more than
$300000000 all you
very quickly 2 very
complicated programs
he was a year of helping
us oversee this to set up
the the flow of those
funds and
as a result we we have been
very successful for that I would
just add to that at NMFA
we strive to be the very
best in
financial administration
control and and
reporting in in the state
system
and
Andy is is a is
a is a big step
a big part of that
effort just the fact
that somebody so
knowledgeable
his insights over to somebody
so knowledgeable is just
review in our financial statements every
month. Representative says
achieve that goal so we're very
happy to.

off.
Good morning.
Good morning madam chair members of the committee
Dan Opperman I'm the chief legal
officer at the New Mexico finance
authority I think to reiterate
what Oscar said
in what has been said about member Burke
today is his
active involvement in our
organization
we have a very active board
but and
it definitely leads the way
expressly and
handling our audit committee
and you know aside
from the audit committee and his and his
direct involvement our board meetings
he has been
just an incredibly valuable
member to organization and we really
appreciate the
nomination to continue to let
him be part of our organization
thank you thank you for your
comments anybody in the
committee room in
opposition of the
appointment.
Signal go to questions from the
committee.
Centered.
Mr chair I don't have a question
but I
believe that the law firm where
I am employed also represents
NMFA so
I something law firm so I'm gonna
need to re cues
from from the spoke
thank you.
Thank you chairman and
the other question Senator
Lopez.
Thank you Mr chair
I know that NMFA again
plays an important
role in the state of New
Mexico.
And I had asked
Mr Baldo with the
our.
The New Mexico.
Mortgage finance authority are
still sometimes get an MFA in
all these different acronyms
mixed up so my apologies
I have to look
at
what.
For the role that you play in the state of New
Mexico what
type of communication do you
have so that
the greater community
members of our state no of
the role that you
play.
Senator Lopez
Mr chair Senator
Lopez.
I think by the best example
of that
would be
some of the advertising we
actually did during the
pandemic
on the small business side
of things to indicate
that that funds are
available.
You know for for
relief both grants
and loans that you know in
many cases were from
legislation that that
was approved by the.
By the Senate and and
so
forth.
You know through through
the the
both the association
of of the counties and
and the association of the
cities that think NMFA's
become you know well
known as a source
for smaller.
Governmental and
school district
entities in particular
to have the opportunity
to to
finance their
loans
you know in a more cost
effective.
Of the way then they would
be able to if they want to the open
market
themselves.
All you know I
I would say the same
is probably
true with with the school
districts and and
hybrid community and
the bonded visor of
community here in New Mexico
certainly
makes a tick
takes the opportunity to
avail themselves of of
financing through
NMFA when it's appropriate
for various entities
across the
state.
Thank you Mr chair and the reason
why I ask of courses
they're also always
other smaller governmental
entities that I know that we had a
conversation recently at
the land grant interim
committee.
Where some of our land grants now that
they are qualifying
to be
a governmental entity essentially
to be able to access
monies for ifs it
is building of a new
a community center is
building whatever it is that they need
infrastructure wise for their
communities.
I I would hope also
that there's open
door
willingness for some
of our land grant communities
again we have authorized
on the account of the
meet certain quality qualifiers
to be able to access
and dollars so I hope that there's an
openness Mr chair
for some of those
potential loans
I know th which will really help as we
talk about
Mr chair even with
the farm and ranch museum
is all inter
related about how
we work to preserve and
encourage communities
to still
to survive because
rona Mexico
is hurting in many different
ways but I
think sometimes Mr chair
funding that comes through
an organization such as yours
and the other
organization it was here
that the finance
authority New Mexico mortgage
finance authority also I
think
help not just
Albuquerque the middle Rio Grande
quarter Mr chair but
outside in
more rural parts of our
state. Thank
you. Thank
you any other
questions.
What's the will of the
committee.
Mr chairman I move

Thank you so much Senator

Mr chair members of the
committee.
I do want to just give you a little bit of
background of myself I know
that Center
just read a bio I
was born and raised in hatch New
Mexico however
when I was
born I was born
hearing and
later I was identified as
staff due to viral
meningitis.
My parents didn't know what to
do at that time I was
the first staff member of the
family I families about
the no family there from 2
well Mexico
and they moved
to southern New
Mexico and we're
farmworkers
so.
At the New Mexico school for the deaf
they have an outreach program
that learn about me and
recently identified deaf person
and they came to me my
parents to
talk to them about the services available
in Santa Fe New Mexico at the New Mexico
school for the deaf
and as a Mexican
the traditional Mexican family we
really value staying
together as a family
unit and so when
the outreach program came
to offer that I move
to Santa Fe at the
age of 4 that
was difficult for my family but
at the age of 6 they decided to
make that decision to
take to send me to
the school for the deaf
I went with the outreach
program at the time I didn't
know American Sign
Language at the
time from
birth through 6
I didn't have any language
I communicated using
gestures with my family
and when I made it to the New Mexico
school for the deaf and got to
meet several other deaf
students staff
teachers
I started to
learn the language and
I essentially grew up there
I learned the language learned
how to read and write in
English
and at the school
I was there for 12 years
pretty much through
graduation of and I finished
my high school degree there
I did a lot of different extra curricular
activities through the New Mexico
school for the deaf and then
upon graduation I attended gala
at university
where I was able to play basketball
they're at guild at university
I move to Arizona school for the deaf
and blind which is
just 4:00 hours from from
home
the family currently lives in Los
crucis and
I any chance I get I
go visit them
so for 9
years I worked at the school for the deaf
there in Arizona and then I moved
to back to Santa Fe
to work
there I worked there
for years
and it was so nice to
have that home coming I
consider NMSC my second home
I grew up there works
there and now
I currently work for the New Mexico
commission for the deaf and hard of
hearing I was
also president
of the New Mexico the New
Mexico school for the deaf alumni
association and I
just recently
as I made my
way to the board of regents. With
the New Mexico school for the deaf had
to leave my post as
the president of
the alumni association but I'm very
thankful for the New Mexico school
for the deaf as well as for your
presence here
today.
Thank you so much
anybody in the
audience in favor of
this conferee.
If you can come
up.
State your name for the
record.
My name is Nathan gum on
the second director for commission
for definite hearing
thank you Mr chairman members
committee it is
my pleasure to
have known Karina and work with her
for over 14
years.
She is a
testament of
New Mexico
a person who's grown
and become a national leader
in many many areas
she is one of the few
yes so I see parameters
in the nation
and one of the only people who I
feel more than
comfortable enough to say I was
support on the board of
regents thank
you thank you for your comments
anyone in
opposition.
Signal go to questions
from the
committee.
Senator
panics.
Thank you very much
Mr chair
so I.
E..
I think I'm a little
confused.
Are you currently
the director of
community advocacy
or are
you.
Retired and be
being appointed to the
board.
Center members of the committee I'm
actually the the current
director of the
the commission for the deaf and hard
of hearing I'm the director of
community
advocacy.
So Mr
chair.
Madam chair I haven't
encountered this before an
employee being.
Pointed to a
board
school.
It's 2 different
things.
Okay I got that correct
so my question
then Mr chair
is it seems that you have a
lot of work
and community
advocacy
and could you tell me
any future
ideas you have for
outreach.
Madam Senator
members of the
committee.
Since my roots are in southern New
Mexico I recognize that
we have a strong Latino
community present there
a lot of families that speak Spanish
and I do maybe want to
talk a little bit about my background
my parents are Spanish speaking
speakers and when I
was born
and when I was kind of making
my way to MST there wasn't
any staff members who could speak
Spanish and communicate
with my family about
what NMSC had to
offer at the time.
Now we do have interpreters
who for example
the current team at the New Mexico
school for the deaf we have
several interpreters who speak Spanish
as well so there trilingual
interpreters who are able
to interpret between the
Spanish speaking families
to really kind of
bridge the services that the
school for the deaf offers
and these families who may not be able
to communicate or access them
when these materials and resources
are only available in English
and so that is a huge victory
for NMSC in for the
state I
think having access
to materials
to staff members to
the schools in their native
language is such an important
part of
their participation and
their early access to these
resources I
think having
access to
these resources is really
important to these families and
we want to make sure that we're communicating
what is available to them what is
most beneficial to them
and working hard to
always have that clear
communication.
Thank you Mr
chair and thank you very much
for that response.
Thank you Senator
Lopez.
Thank you Mr chair
of thank you for your
willingness to
serve on the board of
regents.
One of my questions was
going to be are
we bilingual
when in providing services
to families in New
Mexico.
And you did answer that yes
that we are we
do our region
Spanish
and Mr chair I know that
there are other languages
and our state.
And I guess the question also lends
itself for native American
communities are
there a
students within
the system also
that do come from our native
American communities in New
Mexico.
Senator Mr chair
yes excuse
members of the committee we do
have several
students who come from the
reservations from
all across the the state
so we do provide services
to these families even
on the reservation to these
indigenous communities
many of these communities
are
bilingual in their native
language plus English
and so we do have staff members who can
continue to work with
them we do
have a
interpreter that I know
of that is
fluent I believe
in Navajo
I I'm I'm not certain
what indigenous language they
speak but we do have a trilingual
who is fluent in their
indigenous language income can
communicate with these families
okay thank you Mr
chair and
the other question I have
to
is.
For I know there's a
school in Albuquerque
that provides services
for children students
who are deaf and
hard of hearing.
Are there other schools that you
know of because
maybe not everyone can come to
Santa Fe.
But what type of outreach to
you have
especially Mr
chair with local
school districts about
providing
services
for children and families
who are deaf or hard
of
hearing.
Mr chairman members of the
committee and senator
we do work with different school
districts all across the state
of New Mexico New Mexico
school for the deaf is a statewide
agency and so we partner with
them we educate them
on I defer
resources available to
them we provide them
information
about best practices when it
comes to the education of deaf
children
because they're they're needs are
gonna be unique
working with interpreters for
example how
should the work and partner with
interpreters in these
communities like for example Silver
City of rural
community how
can we ensure
that they're
maximizing
these services we
have a program called
the statewide education
outreach that
provides
interpreter mentoring
and mentorship for
interpreters working rural
areas so that's one
way that we continue to
support students
who don't make their way to NMSC
but are in their home
communities
I know that
as a commissioner
as someone who works at the commission for the deaf
and hard of hearing in my community
advocacy work
we do receive a lot of questions
about where
people can access resources
for their deaf and hard of hearing children
and we often
refer them to an
MST because
of the vast resources that they
have available to cover the
state
I think our out
I often don't have the
answers when it comes to the education
of the outreach part of
things because that that lies within
an MST but when it comes
to stay advocacy that's something
that I'm very very comfortable with an
experience with.
Thank you Mr chair and I
guess my final
question Mr chair
is.
Regarding.
We talk about
advocacy.
What can we do
for and I always say advertising
but you to get the word out
specifically
when we talk about persons with
a learning disability
who have
you know I think there's
still a stigma in our
community about persons
who are blind
hard of hearing deaf
who you know there's there's that
whole list
is there something that we could
do.
For like a PR
campaign.
Just again to get information
out for the community
about.
You know how do we interact
right I mean they're still that stigma
Mr chair and just curious
if there's been conversation
within the board about what we also
we can
do.
What a wonderful question
Mr chair members of the
committee
I would love
to follow up with the board of
the NMAA the board of regents because
I think for
us.
At the commission for the deaf and hard of
hearing we
support not just blind
we support blind
deafblind
individuals based on whatever
their needs may be I
think for
the work as an MST the
New Mexico school for the deaf
in terms of a PR campaign
I I'm not even sure we've given
that much thought that have to
I have to follow up with the board to
to be able to answer that
question.
Thank you Mr chair because the
more we share
information and
try to get rid of that stigma
I think that is that
as a great step
forward for
acceptance in our community
thank you thank you
senator and I just have a few
comments
we have a strong advocate
for the New Mexico school of the deaf
for the deaf by Senator
Rodriguez who has
taught me so much about the
school and
the importance of plays not
only in New Mexico but for families
who rely on the
services and
so I cheered in college
so I'm happy to see that you're a
former collegiate athlete
yourself and so the
school of the deaf has reached out to
me and asked if I will volunteer
and coach the school of the deaf this
year to get them ready for the state
competition and I have
agreed to take that money
and work with them so I'm
looking forward to helping
them out and I know they took the
national title and we're gonna be
coming after the state title
next. So
that that are there any
other questions or comments
from
committee.
If I may just one last
comment Mr
chair.
Thank you so
much.
Members of the committee I do want to
just add a comment about senator
for the
test.
Because of that tight knit
community of growing
up together I've known
we've we've had this close
tie for for for many many
years.
Now that I mention
NMSC is a second home
to me and I really
do volunteer a lot for sporting
events I'm heavily
involved in kind of the
athletic side of NMSC
so I'm actually thrilled to hear
this news about your involvement
with MST thank you so much
for supporting us.
Thank you what's the will of
the
committee.
Mr chairman I move that
we approve
the reappointment
of Karina click
yes The New Mexico
school for the deaf board of
regents motion made by
Senator Stewart seconded
by Senator Stefanics
anyone in opposition
of this appointment.
Seeing none with a vote of 8
yes and to excuse
we'll be seeing you in January in
front of the full Senate.
Thank you so
much.
We're not going to move to the military
base Planning Commission
and with that miss Nadia
Sikes will be
introduced by Senate sponsor
Senator
Lopez.
Mr Chairman
before we move to that can
we get an introduction
for this
gluteus as
a translator
yes he did such a great
job and I'd like to
know his name and
where he's from and where he
got his training and all that
come on up I'd be interested
myself.
Mr chair members of the committee thank
you so much my name
is Orlando or vessel
Gomes I am
a New Mexican born
in Los crucis grew
up in Roswell New Mexico
and then moved to Albuquerque for
school where I attended
the university of New Mexico
and got my bachelor's
in sign language interpreting
as well as linguistics
I have been interpreting with the New
Mexico school for the deaf
now
since
2013
on and off I left
for a while to pursue
my master's degree
in
Spanish English interpretation
and translation
at the university
out on a mother with a how to and
without a high medical
so I am back
and working at an
MST full time as a
staff interpreter I am
a trilingual interpreter Spanish
is my first language
I learned English in the school systems
and American Sign
Language at in
college it's a
pleasure to work with these wonderful
individuals at the New Mexico school
for the deaf and thank you
so much for your
time.
Senator Ortiz the payment I
I it because
my mind does
American Sign
Language.
Is it use in Mexico to the
same symbols and everything
or Mr chair
members of the committee
in Mexico they have their own sign
language many countries have
their own sign languages it's
almost is that as many
spoken languages exist there
probably equal
amount maybe if you were
a sign languages so New Mexico
the use L. S. M.
instead of a SL it's Lynn will make
a kind of the sentence
yeah at Mexican setting which I guess you
could say is the the translation
so you you if you're
speaking in in the United
States in New Mexico
to Spanish speaking family here
which do you
use.
Mr chair members the committee if
I am working with the Spanish
speaking families I often work
between Spanish spoken
Spanish and American Sign
Language depending on the deaf person
that's involved
in in the
interaction.
Did you one last question
it's it's it's incredible
the the complexity
of juggling 3 different
language simultaneously
of but
did you grow up in a family with
the deaf person.
Mr chair members of the committee I
did not grow up
with the the family members
I've had the just
good fortune of
being
of welcomed member of the deaf
community here in New Mexico
where they have really taken the
time to support me in my journey
as a as a sign language interpreter
so I really so a lot
of my skill and my success
to the deaf community here in New
Mexico.
Incredible thank you so much
for what you're doing thank
you.
Thank you.
Thank you thank you
for that Senator
Lopez.
Thank you Mr chair and
salute to rate for those who
are trilingual
in many different aspects and
it shows the complexity that our
brains Mr chair can really
handle
we have a computer up here and we
don't use it fully in so many
ways.
No well that's true that's another
discussion Mr
chair.
Mr chair of
madam chair members of the
committee I'm honored to sit
next to Nadia Sikes
who has been appointed to serve
to serve on the
military base Planning
Commission.
And some of us will
remember Mr
chair when this commission came
about and the reason
why.
Back in the day of of when
they were base closures that were being
proposed across this
country. And
of course for us in order to
advocate because the
base.
Basically had
the. Has
a military bases are very central
to New
Mexico
and they've been around here for a long
time we just
saw the movie with
Oppenheimer
and how that has
been central of course to
more
investments in the state in many
different ways the good the bad
and sometimes the not
so good.
But the military
base Planning Commission Mr
chair is central to our
economy here in the state of New
Mexico and what it
provides to different
communities whether it's in
Albuquerque
over your
Alamogordo.
White sands
on the east side of the state
Mr chair in in
it's just central to who we
are.
And miss Sykes
who sitting here next to me I've
known her for a number of
years often
on a first matter
as an opportunity
with some community work that she was
involved with but also because of
her radio show
there in Alamogordo
and she was always
very thorough
very straightforward but very open
for discussions that we
used to have when I was
invited to to share some
of my interest
at the time
but she's very involved Mr
chair members of the committee
in her community
and I don't want to
I'll leave some time for her Mister
chair if it's so please is for
her to share a little bit more about her
investment that she
has
within the city of
Alamogordo the community
in the greater community of
course that surrounds
Alamogordo
but I know that Mr chair she will
be
of.
A very.
A person who will bring
much with her
and the commitment that she has in
her community involvement I know
is a definite voice that
is needed on this
commission. If
I could Mr chair just to turn
it over to miss Sykes
to see a little bit
more thank you good
morning.
Good morning good morning
Senators good
morning.
Anybody left in the
audience I
would first I like to think Senator
Lopez yes we've known
each other for a while and
she's always been
a supporter
in Ontario county
invited 2 of
the number of events
that we would do I happen to have
been the Democratic
Party chair for a number of years
which gave me a little insight
into how Otero
county
operated
of couple things I just want to mention
please indulge me up
a few of the comments that
some of the senators of maybe a bit
of they're very near and dear
to my heart for
example the questions about
communications
I think it's really important that
we
let the
lead places like Otero
County let the state
know the things that are
happening throughout the
state and I use
my radio program
to do just that it's a community
radio program or I have the
opportunity to
interview a lot of the community members
a lot of the elected officials a lot
of people from around
the state including our
state senators and
congresspeople to
promote the issues that
are happening granted it's
not the whole world is listening to
me but I really do for
the past 12 years try
to. Spend a
little bit of time making
sure that people are aware of
some of the incredible programs
that are. Part
of the school for the visually
impaired the
schools for the
a hard of hearing
and all
of a lot of the nonprofits
the other thing I wanted to mention
Senator Stuart mentioned
early on
the pollinators
and one of the things I did when I
first became a city
commission Alamogordo
I was the I was
really
amazed to
know that it was
not an ordinance to be able
to raise and bees
within the confines
of Alamogordo.
And I would have been interested in
politics for a number of
years
and past
look of through the
work of my colleagues
and and convincing them
how important it was
we were able to pass an
ordinance where you're allowed
now to be bee
keepers and
Alamogordo and
as a result I received a number
of save the bees
teachers.
All one of the things that I've
done I've lived in the Alamogordo
community now for 18 years
but I think it's
important to
recognize the fact that I
am I rarely in
my lifetime been without a
military ID card
my father was Montoya my
brother Ivan nieces
Military born in the
Philippines move to
a Alamogordo with
my husband who is active
duty I married a man in the
military.
They're in Alamogordo
for about 18 years now
and spent the majority
of my time they're making the
most of the community by getting
to know the
community through
a lot of the service organizations
and nonprofits.
And realizing how
important Holloman Air
Force base to the tune
of approximately
$400000000
annually how
Holloman impacts
Alamogordo
on over the years I managed to
get.
Get appointed to a
honorary.
Squadron,nder position
which gave me a lot more insight
into Holloman Air Force base
I've always used
the clinics on the basis or I've
been all right
I had the opportunity
to the station with either
my father or my
husband.
And I I
I I feel like it's
it's. It
was an involvement
to request
or to even be
considered for the
base Planning Commission
as time goes on I think
it's become more and more
important for
the surrounding community
to realize
the the value
of Holloman Air Force base
not only with the test track
but with the person who were stationed
there with the
the the drones
the person who were stationed there
with the aircraft maintenance
it's a it's just a very
significant in our
community I
appreciate the
opportunity and
I'm honored to at least
to have a
part and what we're
doing to support the bases
throughout New Mexico and
by the way I managed to
a. To book a
lodging at Kirtland Air
Force base last night
and a compliment to
both Albuquerque and
Cortland the
lodgings around
the United States
white sands
Holloman Kurland
are pretty incredible
of and the people
that you meet out there the work
that you see as being
done out at all of the
bases just gets
more and more
and more and more important
so I appreciate this
honor honoring the
opportunity thank
you thank
you. Seeing
that there's nobody left to the audience I
want to go straight to the committee
any questions or
comments from committee members
Senator budget.
Thank you Mr chair
so could you give
us
from you what you know
the current.
Status
of
discussion around the
loss of bases
in individuals on our
bases here in the
state.
What I know currently I
I look around I
still get Air Force magazine and
I still talk to a lot of people in
the military but
I look around and I see
that.
Depending on the strength
of our US
senators and congresspeople
our bases.
Tend to fluctuate
with how
strong and valuable
people think they are.
I think that we have a real friend
and senator Martin
Heinrich he recently
was able to acquire over
$54000000
for Home airforce
base and the test
track I go
out to the base frequently
for.
Burger burns
as a honorary
squadron,nder for the test
group that's pretty
much my
involvement
but I have conversations
with folks and who
are.
Who are a a little bit
concerned about the fact
that a lot of civilians
are going to be losing their jobs
soon I think it's
approximately 84 on
Holloman Air Force base
because.
Currently with the
mission they have
enough active
duty military personnel
to take over those positions
so the contractors are going to
be
unfortunately let
go after the first of the
year.
I am the.
Just in talking to the
community talking to the,nder and
I do a regular show with the
regular radio show with
the,nder of Holloman
Air Force base the 40 ninth wing
and his,nd chief
and every now and then they allow
me the opportunity to
delve into
the things that they're concerned
about for the most part we keep it
pretty light of
make sure that the
the folks in
Alamogordo or
happy with what homes doing
vice versa.
So.
I don't Senator
is to provide etcetera I
answered that are just talked
around it that's fine
so Mr chair
my
next question is do you
because of all your past
history of
family wise do you have anything
to do with the
honor flights that go to
DC.
Actually.
My father passed away before
he would have been eligible for an
honor flight but I work very
closely with a
gentleman by the name of Dale Lindley
in Alamogordo who
is supporting.
The nonprofit that supports
the honor flights
and to the point
now where if we
don't.
Do those honor flights
for all of the folks that
deserve them
currently.
In the very near future
there will be any reason to do
them all those folks
are getting up
in age
I know that the honor
flight that just happened in
Alamogordo.
Of the person
who was honored and taken to
Washington DC was
close to 100 years
old. So
I think it's very important
that those on our flights
should there be people
eligible that they be
funded and that
the of families and
individuals who
served in the
military
are honored appropriately
by being able to take a flight if
this if they so
choose.
Well thanks for that response by
the time my father
was invited
he was to disable to
go and
he wouldn't even consider it but
it would have meant a lot
if it had happened.
Prioritize thank
you for your understanding of
that thank you Mr chair
thank you Senator Duhigg
thank you Mr chair
I just wanted to
make sure you knew us senator
Byrd called me the other
day hi he
couldn't be here to to
sponsor but he could not speak
highly enough of you and
so I just wanted to pass that
on. Thank
Senator and I appreciate
that through the years I
have been
friends with Senator
Burt as
a radio guy
I really appreciate what he
doesn't Alamogordo.
One of the things when he was
first elected that he said
and at the time I was the
chair of the Democratic Party
he actually made it a point
to come to me and
say now that I'm
elected this I am
everybody's Senator
and.
That being said he has
been he's been extremely
supportive of Holloman Air Force
base I've never been out to a
general meeting where he
hasn't been there
of so thank you
for that I appreciate
it.
Thank you any other comments
or questions.
What's the will of the
committee.
Mr chairman I move that
we approve
the appointment of
Nadia college
site X. to the
military base Planning Commission
a motion made by Senator Stewart
and seconded by Senator
Stefanics anyone in
opposition.

in favor 2 excused

Before we break for lunch

the bike over to Senator Duhigg
for any other
comments you might want to make
before.
