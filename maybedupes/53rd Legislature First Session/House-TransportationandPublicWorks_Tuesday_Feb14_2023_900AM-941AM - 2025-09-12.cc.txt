But reflections blocking off all
very how mission we.
Andrea and requests for
commercial driver's license what
commercial from committee for
life.
If
the commercial commercial.
Yes so so members of this this
is really is the fact that it's
created discovering talents this
national drug and alcohol tests
for their in house.
And it received reports.
Our test positive.
On arrival yes or the refused to
submit to those tests this is a
nationwide database and so what
this bill does is it
requires a device New Mexico to
use for house and Representative
check the current house address
replies for a CDL and the the
good thing is is that right now
we do this but only records in
New Mexico are able to be
checked this national curry also
let us someone is a driver C. L.
here tested positive in a
different state you'll then get
this information and
really the important thing is
the fed.
have made contingent a lot of
money coming into our state on
the state adopting this policy
so if we don't adopt this was a
lot of federal that was after
thank you thank you madam chair
Representative harbors of COVID.
We have one forty four getting
complies with the federal.
Licensure department and not the
state will move a lot of funding
the department transportation
funding the fact that we're not
provide for them the madam chair
representative this is a good
deal because we have C. for.
Relations people.
The combined loan regulations.
Whether.
Madam will sentences.
Thank you very much
Representative let's go to the
public to have anybody here
standing in favor of the bill
HB.
You.
A
host of this bill.
Yup I'll get to you.
Regarding the.
anybody's zoom either.
Now Representative Pettigrew.
Thank you madam chair and I'm
not too sure I'm opposed to
thank you.
Understand.
Exactly how we define a lot of
money and what exactly.
That dollar amount.
Over one year or ten years
chair.
So that.
To me a lot of money it's about
five dollars.
To
was not here for our and I
didn't ask that question
secretary when she
present this to me and I was so
we should be here to answer that
for to see snow pack a lot of
people coming today.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you for a representative of
at the end of the day so many of
these that come down from the
feds are just what they are with
respect to either we do it or we
don't get federal funding to
like it that.
one question another question I
have madam chair and leave the.
Last one.
Additional with the other the
other states but it doesn't
really talk about international
so we have a lot of.
Of
Drivers echo more than south
across through the through our
border checkpoints what are we
doing to verify this for our
licenses law.
Last question.
Madam chair and representative
actually got a.
Part of the church here for
so I appreciate you guys being
here so they get a grant from
the feds and over two years
about six point six point two
million dollars perfect thank.
I'm sorry John I did not hear
that answer can you repeat that
twenty six point how many six
point one six one two million
dollars over two years thank you
very much.
Now we'll go to Representative
this thank you madam chair Paul
so madam chair you have an
answer for the second
question with respect to what
we're doing.
People in international you know
and
Lashandra will go back to work
Representative Harper said.
The secretary taxation one for.
Do a fact and whether.
The non.
I wrote this law loss the actual
but others will improve with the
for us I mean.
The park area of the coming the
food to the state or that sent
off.
Madam chair representative yes
we have drop off points in many
different parts of the of the
state and then they can go
across state lines as well with
respect to distributions so
madam chair I I'm not opposing
the bill but it is thanks for on
like if we have some answers on
that I'd like to know how the
affects our international
thanks.
Now Representative Cruz thank
you madam chair representatives
on our end.
Are a little bit confused so if
you come to New Mexico do you
have to are you talking about
when you apply for a CEO.
From another state and tested
positive there but from here you
don't test positive.
So so madam chair and a reserve
builders policies for crystal
clear on this so this is a New
Mexico process this is Mexico
tax revenue department and the
if you apply for a commercial
driver's license to go through a
process here that exists right
now.
And that process does go through
background you know a drug test
information but does not use the
new national clearinghouse.
So this bill would require
our state now use that national
clearinghouse so we would.
A bit of a dual process both
state and federal.
So here is that coincide with
either all call or legalize
cannabis.
So madam chair as observed
truce.
If you test positive for alcohol
either in Mexico or outside that
will be mailed captured in this
new national database same thing
with cannabis whatever they're
testing for
and also if you refuse to.
Yes that always captures actions
now we will have that
information.
Madam chair on question.
In.
Decred only the kind of this
vehicle.
Your commercial driver's license
dispositive we will go against
you regardless of how the state
works
at home sure that they're in our
version will get better.
We'll be sure.
The international part then roll
on madam chair the genesis of
the issue.
You'll hear it is ninety one
other states so.
Which it did represent thank you
madam the thing that
Representative Brown thank you
madam chair
Good morning wraps if I have to
will issues with the bill a
service support the bill but I'm
going to suggest that for the
next committee which is taxation
and revenue assuming the bill
gets out of this committee that
you maybe think of an amendment
or to to the bill and it's it's
for reasons that are mostly
the concert and Services new
material madam chair and
representative and so sometimes
you know it's not excessive
statute section one of the bill
so I just want to draw your
attention to page three Madam
chair
starting at one seven.
you know to speak with it says
the division show request.
Commercial driver's drug and
alcohol third house records of
an applicant for a commercial
driver's license at time issue.
Madam chair in insurance so at
the time of issuance to need to
wait but it's at the time I I
would suggest at the time of the
of the application being made
and the reviews.
So it's it's just a phrase and
there are two and three madam
chair Representative Harper
register see if you have any
thoughts on that.
Madam Representative Brown
that's a great question I.
What the flow is a process for
TRD when they actually.
well they're they're staffs are
but I'd love to talk with them
and ask them if.
I have flown make sense to
review it prior to type of
issuance and respect that.
Thank you very much chair
representative for thank on the
next page page for.
There's a sentence thirty three.
I think it needs a better
reserves as I had to read this
sense about twenty times shows
so Madam I think it's a city in
issue there is a now streamed
all of one for is the mainstream
its commercial driver's license
information system driver record
and I still not sure with the
birds are for what information
it so here's the state division
show complete and record on the
commercial driver's license
information system driver record
within sixty days of the
division's receipt of the record
I'm not sure what they're
reporting and all that so I'm
just going to highlight that
sentence and suggested that we
look at and see if we can fix it
somehow yeah okay.
Thank you madam chair and then
Representative Harper
Representative Garcia the
language on page six thirty
point two sentences.
Federal freezing.
If some of that might give a
clue as to how to do the others.
But in the statute so we want to
make sure it's clear.
So I do support the bill unless
you have any comments.
Madam.
venture Representative Brown
thank you for that I agree that
census.
Using yeah.
Interests and
I do think the sense on.
Six is more clear so we'll just
we'll talk with the secretary as
we can to.
Chair of rules involved the
state police officer again rural
verification and so.
Madam chair members of what
half of our facilities I run
first more people puro within
state police and what happens
now with the clearing houses
every company is mandated by
what the vegetation appropriate
level of of medical personnel or
be company and just put on the
list is so when drivers go into
this clearing house yes and
state road side
some post crash accident happens
each company has a set of
standards that that sends these
people to get tested those tests
are then brought back to the
company they have to report to
TRD and the systems and then
that is plus put into a federal
system which is then look at
through two sets of entities
which is the federal government
and state governments and that's
for the data ends up going it
affects the drivers the
company's profile which is based
on a seven basic profile and
drug alcohol standards and
that's what.
Okay.
Madam chair Representative Joe
thank you so much all right I
think it's a good explanation I
still think that wording needs
to be worked out a little bit
thank you madam chair.
What else.
Thank you for reading this
gentleman I just have a couple
of comments and one question so
when I was going through
language I too found it pretty
confusing on page six paid for
early in the page six just kind
of the concern of.
I'm funded mandate in the way
that we're asking for additional
testing additional verification
I went
I sought out director Avid to
trying to get more information
on the federal funding that
would be missing out on if we
weren't able to get this program
in place by twenty twenty four
the verified it was something
around around that number but I
I I I I think that the I think
that this language needs work so
I'm going to I'm going to vote
for the bill as it is but it is
my hope that the he will work
with the secretary and kind of
get some of these issues watch
out so
that information.
Collaborative have second.
does anybody.
Time of the day because of the.
Thank you have yourself a
depressed.
Those programs thank you.
The statement just simply by
your Garcia.

The national members need to be

governor percent the emergency
always cold providing that the
course that's required to be

fiction website will last the
the future of New Mexico.
Good morning madam chair of the
committee Franklin Garcia with
the mold Division armo Division
does include our ports of entry
last year during some of the
decorations we did hear from
some of our neighboring states
where they were increase in the
size and weight to their
Vehicle traffic in order to get
more supplies of commodities
through to disaster areas and so
when we took it upon ourselves
to try to match that we did some
internal discussions with all
three sections with our rural
section of our ****.
Session and determine which
roads and what capacity the the
vehicles could travel on and so
we try to try to drop a similar
message on we are increasing the
oversized leaf
alles we realize we have that
story so we are at fault for
this to the governor's office to
get but we're trying to do is
just get the ability to be more
nimble and get this done more
quicker because we see that
there's an applicant's after the
for that increase capacity so
I did mention to us on the staff
that Johnnie Johnson Mexico
trucking association would be
here he was an eastbound every
seven email last night is
support the bill to try to get
commodities because okay those
things water things to the year.
That'll happen.
We have anybody in the audience
news forces well.
Senator.
Madam chair damages are
represented as Mexico
association of the war just
heard during the firing more of
last summer our trucks stopped
has to be
some critical water transporting
of.
Firefighters the same thing
happened to us to call we're
sending thousands of cases of
water to the Navajo Nation gal
we.
The state critical and most.
We support.
Thank you.
and chairman of the committee
Mexico state which also supports
this bill under federal
regulations we have the ability
to assess the safety standards.
C. but we have this is we have
this in place as well so this
will help streamline processes
to accessories.
You on the suit.
We have anybody opposed to this
bill.
Okay it's going to the committee
chair this project original B.
or need to fix this for the
future.
In this role.
religion thank you very much
there are question I had
primarily for the department is
is only in the is this only
after a couple for emergencies.
In the the reason I ask this
madam chair is that I'm very
familiar with.
Our plants and refineries do
what they call a turnaround or
shutdown in the summertime where
they replace a lot of very heavy
or or new kinds of equipment.
And of course was almost trucks
is going to be heavier than
what's allowed so my my question
is is in those kind of
situations they with prior
notice what they.
Would we be able to us.
Madam chair of the committee and
Representative Lundstrom we do
have abilities to do super loads
up when there's situations like
that the big long term wives or
super large capacity we do have
coordination with are present
office and we would we would be
requirements additional
requirements that we need
emergency declaration for those
purposes the super low than
those kind of these we've all
process off lease.
Are to have esports we have to
map out there that are all the
recipes use so there is a
process already for that
situation okay all right thank
you.
Other committee members.
Representative thank you madam
chair thank you Frank for this
Senator first question would be
with respect to the this
business open it up completely.
I don't see anything that puts
the DOT and charges
Defining rounds so if this
emergency order was put into
place.
Is this automatic that people
can survive oversize loads and
loads of phone within that
because.
Madam chair with respect to some
of our infrastructure there's
areas where that oversize load
The New Mexico or that
overweight one that need to go
and then someone to DOT has any
control over it.
This bill passed in the language
that given thank you madam.
Madam chair.
and I just language that we we
did the elevation within the to
be able to breeze past these
a rural route so the different
roads during one of the the
COVID nineteen we have the
interstates which could be that
capacity so we went from eighty
six thousand eighty eight
thousand pound us and we are in
our maintenance staff with
reception like I said with our
purpose section and then we
identify certain routes and we
put that actually on the job
that they would receive of all
our office.
Both partly with going through
the state to get to the other
states to deliver this.
For for for all that which our
our budget years did mention
that we that capacity there was
some other roadways that we ask
while close to Texas models to
Colorado different things out
that we limited it to based on
the size of the yard.
Chairman thank I I hear what
you're saying but the way that I
read this.
The
issue permit for that of the
south of my reading this wrong.
Okay Madam chair representative
committee.
We just allow us to make
permissible changes to the to
the permits that we currently
issues special permits that we
utilize that includes system so
we don't have the ability to
increase its capacity for about
the same age.
Madam chair.
And Frank thank you that was my
biggest concern the way I read
this legislation the DOT would
be part of that permitting
process staples is overweight
oversize vehicles didn't
necessarily have to be permitted
during the time to see and the
number of.
So thank you thank you.
Representative.
Yes thank you madam chair
Santo Sierra and Mr.
I am looking at from page two
sections started online twenty.
This is the heart of the bill I
think.
The question have been chair and
Mr cigna is.
It doesn't say particular
highways or roads
that we would.
Suspender modify the
requirements it sounds like
assistance over all for your.
not to my credit madam chair I
did not look at the full
section statutes mention their
online twenty five I did look at
sixty seven.
Six six seven four one eight
four sixteen but what is in that
part of the statute that would
be discreet regarding which
part ways of we would be looking
at.
Chair so madam chair years if
you Representative Brown we will
put the exact routes because it
will be.
for the actual after.
So if it's within the state
after I have to ask.
The state.
George goals that identical to
the route we would probably
understand them they are safer
probably the ones that would of
course not allowable and for the
national rate.
Gentleman that based on our
internal permitting process and
to follow up with
representatives Madam these
these
We could wait for the for the
actual after during that.
Which we did in the past and it
was just a minimal impact on the
part of but to try to expedite
these long to do the things that
we purposes.
Madam chair representative Mr
this year so.
So it's more the blanket
separation correct suspended or
modifying those requirements for
you to give our size weight and
vote
I'm concerned am sure that there
county feeder roads to our
highways
And if if we're not aware of
state some issues on those roads
we may be seeing traffic
diverted there and that may not
be good for safety reasons for
example maintenance branch it's
not very sound anymore and I
don't know that the D. O. T.
madam chair necessarily knows
all of those aspects of the
system and so I'm just concerned
that there may be some.
Safety issues that could crop up
so madam chair I wonder if we
could get a response.
Madam chair they're spending
around we do have news is larger
all bridges around the state if
there was a set of section you
work directly with the.
The county and municipality and
so and certification at our
website with our.
The actual truck Association
with our legislative process and
and work on those routes so we
do have a routing system that's
been our permitting office staff
make sure that they're not to go
over
this capacity and that's even
before it's still Senator to
wait program around system for
all these trucks.
Thank you madam chair and and
the two Garcia's.
Do you have
I don't see anything in the bill
that says for how will it says
is this is the emergency has is
under way in the case of the the
COVID changes we saw it's been
over two years now I just want
to get.
The the Secretary of Indian to
you could err presume.
Suspect or modify that then at
some point say we no longer need
to do that you know commercial
trucking so doing okay and what
that does that show up on the
website is health help with
truckers be notified if that
manager.
Madam chair is the rest of the
brown we would have our
permitting
Dashboard will informations we
serve our trucking association
shared with our
our law enforcement partners and
fifty years does say that would
be put on our website so we.
Also of the public consumption
there we work in the past year
of those are communications
office we put out a decorations
for be out from outreach as well
to the.
The public current.
Madam chair and in general so I
I understand the need for the
bill is I think there is a valid
concern here
One of my favorite cartoons of
late was it was a photograph of
a semi truck on a highway.
And it was it was like.
Step to wait five stories high
with toilet paper instead of
shipment to Walmart and there
are times fifty we do have high
capacity trucking that we need
to do and it was funny at the
time I guess.
This.
But anyway I I support the bill
thank you for bringing it.
Madam chair.
We're.
right now all your size move
away there is permits in place
already if you buy here today or
you can buy a focus on the two
four and your side we Mexico the
will solve a permit for the
deeper still a lot of.
Who your weight or size and then
the move the deregulation of
robbing we can capital right
that's already in place.
For a lot of the new year Madam
chair in case of emergency that
we had in our.
The group gets the needed people
out and I guess this is the.
But this.
Additional information.
Thank you Mr the.
Once.
Okay it was a pleasure.
Committee yes.
With
anybody opposed the bill.
Okay Representative.
To pass.
Receive federal.
There.
Well.
So.
Problems.
And then he is the problem is
is.
Good morning members.
How are you today.
Good to talk to us about how to
seventy one.
Chair off.
The law.
Crashes that result.
The person that needs to
property of five hundred dollars
or more are populated for
publication of annual costs
assistance for the state this
bill would have to have the
potential for five thousand.
On average there are about forty
four thousand vehicle crashes
submitted by law enforcement DOT
traffic record section these
include property damage social
entity of the report.
Would reduce the number of
fashion point amended by
approximately forty percent.
Allows you to to find that I
find work for the more timely
fashion the five hundred dollar
threshold is the the state since
nineteen ninety six.
We are going to use.
Members of the federal model
anymore the forecast for your
recommends the following
additional for all classes.
All statewide involved in
personal injury or property
damage of one thousand dollars
or more.
DOT maintains a statewide
database for reportable motor
vehicle crashes to be used for
highly annual report address
questions that that for programs
to address crosses public
utilities madam chair stand for
questions all right anybody in
the audience here for.
Part of this bill.
But as.
Anybody opposed to the bill.
I was afraid representative
licensure impose your bill just
be space in your age.
Sure.
Google business I walked over to
appropriations and they walked
back in the specified said Mr
order just as some operations.
It was going on.
Representative.
Here we go it's a good question
the reserve of the upping of the
prices because we've got five
far four hundred dollars you
present.
Everything is so expensive that
that five hundred dollars cover
anymore my.
Madam chair members the
committee representative Garcia
that's correct you know we're
seeing now if you got you know
better better in the.
Which is our parking lot that
four percent cost upwards of a
thousand dollars but the
challenge for New Mexico
department transportation is we
have to track the lower ball
lower amounts of.
Five hundred dollars and more so
we could limit so five hundred
dollars less bill self reported
items we focus on the larger.
Crash report numbers then.
Thank you for signing.
They got a television that.
Representative Brown.
Thank you madam chair.
Mr chairman and Representative I
I think this is almost too low I
don't know of any car repair
that can be done for for less
than that anymore and I'm not
admitting to anything your
vendors.
But I I don't I I know that this
in this five hundred dollar
level is is pretty antiquated
but I think even the thousands
and to clean a month from now
you but never chair
Representative bye I learned
something from reading this bill
I did not know and that is that
drivers have an affirmative duty
to report an accident of the
statute right now with the
Property damages five hundred
dollars or more I didn't know
that Madam chair when there's an
accident we know to call the
police and insurance.
This is existing statute says
the driver of the vehicle.
Involved in an accident so there
could be more than one driver
resulting in bodily injury to or
death of a person or total
property damage to an apparent
extension of five hundred
dollars
Where shall within five days
after the accident for the
written report the accident to
the department of
transportation.
Representative chair
Mr I don't think New Mexico
drivers know that they're
supposed to report and in the O.
T. when there's there's access
so I'm wondering if this is even
happening right now I assume
Madam chair representative that
the police.
Reporter where he's to be
reported that the insurance
company of course is involved to
some extent but I I don't know
that drivers know this and I
wonder if for safety reasons and
just to comply with the statute
of the everybody ought not to
put out some kind of notice when
driver's licenses are renewed
fears in the funding need to
report these things.
madam chair I.
I think I'm just curious to know
to know this is again it's
existing statute but it says
this driver has been involved
has to forward a written report
which implies that the drivers
creating the report.
But forty something and again
receiving that's the police
report but in my wife madam
chair representative police
reports do not usually get
turned around in five days it
may take weeks.
There's a perfect record for the
police departments are it's all
part of the statue I think was
was interesting to me and
Miss madam chair if you have any
observations on that Madam chair
of the committee Representative
route here's a sample of
Director for pressure port and
up on the top as reporting part
is usually the agency but they
may okay you got a fender Bender
and close the store is often
made road then the officer your
amendment just have you forms
that you need to fill out this
call self report so we do
receive those self reports that
coming to us most people I guess
to a crash that need to report
to their insurance need a couple
of case number so they will go
back to that and that was how we
could get a case number and
submit that to their to their
insurance company and and follow
up to that but then the ones
that there's a case number
provided and the agency that
would send that to us so we're
receiving the through the agency
are to self report from that
individual so it is at.
