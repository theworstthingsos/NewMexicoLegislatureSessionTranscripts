Mr president and that's the bill
first of all I very much
appreciate the compromise
reached on the capital gains we
spent a lot of time the other
night talking about capital
gains and changing the threshold
business in that in that window
and so that was suggested as
something that would address
that issue it was accepted by
the other side that's a big step
but I think addresses that
full deduction and I think that
fits right in with the message
that that this legislature sent
during this session to our
health care community and it
around and make that a full
deduction I think that's a
really important step on the
trigger on the G. R. T. is
absolutely critical that's the
we had been at twenty forty five
we compromised at twenty thirty
seven so that trigger will be
there I think that's a very
important protection and just
finally I think the the work
something together that that
will really send a strong signal
to our film partners here in New
Mexico and the many New Mexicans
who work in this industry this
like but and in fact there were
things that we had to give up
that I really didn't want to do
but in the end of the day I
think we've come up with
something that makes us a much
better bill and again I really
Thank you Mr president members
of the body I I also really
appreciate the.
The work that went into getting
this put together I don't know
but you know things happen up
here you you you change your
mind sometimes on things but
that was really one of the big
so I want to thank the governor
for working with me on that she
did come down here give me a hug
so we'll just get that room
around the way I have told my
wife already so
this and with the the the my
chairman Senator Shendo and and
the floor leader
a lot of the things that that I
pay it out of their pocket and
so I think that getting that
right away really helps to our
doctors how much we want to hear
New Mexico and how important
either right I wish there was no
tax increases at all in this but
overall.
We're sending to.
The people of New Mexico.
I thank you for allowing me to
be part of it and working
together to get a good solution
for the state of New Mexico
thank you Mr president thanks
Senator Representative.
thank a those in the conference
committee for their hard work
and all they did and this it is
a in improvement at least in my
eyes over what went over
is great they deserve that money
back so I want to appreciate
that and that compromise I want
to point out however that as a
matter of policy when we're
giving money back as a state.
come across these tax issues
again if we're mailing out
cheques.
There's been a problem up front
you've been over taxed and I
know projections come out in
years now of tax rebates and and
what we need to do is let the
taxpayers keep their money but
again I want to appreciate the
work that went into the
believe then when this bill left
to this chamber and so I
appreciate it thank you.
Any further debate centers
center share followed by sending
did pretty much what we always
do but this version is vastly
superior to the last twelve

Thank you.
came this year we talked about
making big tax policy change in
New Mexico and how we will
really wanted to create a better
for business and how the big
change should happen in big
And we got to think about a
billion dollars of what we're
going to spend over the next
three years to change tax policy
in New Mexico to make it better
This was the year and where did
we end up.
We ended up kind in the mix some
good some bad some some delayed
some triggers we based our
The changes are happening I
don't know if that's a market
glitch that's going to come back
or we can start seeing strained
we spent a lot of money the
remaining money comes from it's
not reoccurring money that comes
in.
To the state and that's where
the rebates are coming from.
New Mexico's gonna learn the
about that thick all the
deductions all the everything
and all we've done is add to
that book maybe another eighteen
pages thank you Mr president.
Senator Sedillo Lopez.
some bad and so from my
perspective I wanted to talk a
little bit about the bad.
So this bill raises liquor
excise tax by twenty percent.
So the increase is one point
four cents a serving.
Wine is currently taxes seven
cents a serving so the increases
one point four cents a serving.
So raising tax taxes by a penny
and a half or less than a penny
per drink will have absolutely
no impact on consumption.
And Mister president.
Consumption is a huge problem in
our state is the root of the
the bottom of the good list it's
not the only cause but it is a
substantial because.
It appears.
alcohol treatment and none of it
will go to the general fund.
I think that's a good thing but
what I notice about that.
three million dollars that.
Just like the fact that we chose
not to use it to reduce
consumption.
The fact that we're only gonna
We had an opportunity to make
transformational change to
address a huge social problem in
our state and we didn't do it.
I have is that we continue to
discuss.
An evidence based strategy to
reduce consumption in our state
Back over the house.
I.
I voted for it as a.
Since being a team player.
And frankly I did not see where
we could possibly.
End up with something that I
could support.
Or that I thought would be good
for the people of New Mexico.
I have to say right now standing
here.
So often when we go into a
conference committee.
Yes.
It's the.
It's the dis talking these.
The Senate was a team.
The Senate held together as a
team and each person.
And I'm just incredibly proud.
Of the fact that we were able to
do that and the changes we're
able to make.
But.
Despite the fact that they
failed.
That didn't mean that they were
not listen to.
And so.
Where we came together and work
together on this.
To get to this point.
And to my surprise.
We have a package.
On film for those you all know
I'm a fix bill supporter it's
important for people to know
that most of the filming
activity the vast majority
incentive that's going to be
crucial but I also want I I only
bring that Mr president
colleagues just to say it's
something we're going to have to
because there's so many
communities out here and I I
work with my help support and
not just Los crucis Farmington

so the two can carry I can go on
talking about it Alamogordo
thank you very much for this.
We do have further debate
Senator Griggs.
Thank you Mr president and.
And look at how they're feeling
right now.
Because Mr president and and
members of the body we've had
some contentious moments during
the past fifty nine days.
The body came together the.
Conference committee came
together.
We work some stuff out.
For everybody coming together in
support of what.
They've worked on.
You know we had we had what I
And I'm hopeful everybody feels
pretty good about this one I
think maybe there's some things
that we all would have right to
like we could all support for
the betterment of the people of
New Mexico.
How can we do any better than
that.
back we're gonna have more
things that we can work on and
we can work on together.
as well who knows who knows
don't and I want everybody to to
know frankly to order some
