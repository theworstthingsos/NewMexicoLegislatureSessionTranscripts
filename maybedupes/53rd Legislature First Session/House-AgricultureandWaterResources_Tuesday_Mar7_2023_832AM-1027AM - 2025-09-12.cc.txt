The.
C. dollars to do this.
So I.
It'll.
Mr chair.
It.
This represents.
With us we know that.
Actually right.
Of the project.
This
is.
What sort.
Anticipate.
to get to the.
Despite.
Years but is.
That we.
From.
On.
The.
Distribution as it will get.
People.
I know that The appropriation.
Do that
so that.
There's a
lot of.
This is.
She is the appropriate.
It was a typical

We work with every one of these.
To be able to do over the next

But.
Well this.
The projects to do that thank

Representative.
K..
There's a.
Our.
The.
What.
If they are.
It's due to the yes I.
We do look at that.
The staff.
Look to see how the project
started.
With the thank you.
As we.
Are you ready to get those
dollars as possible.
So we.
This
is what is that.
In two years we give them three
but we want that done in two
years so because we know how
like this Mr chairman I
appreciate the response miss
Russell Representative if we
don't.
We've seen what's happened as
colliding prices and people make
application percent that we
can't finish the project now
because prices have doubled
something this in these entities
to complete the project within
two year cycle is only only
beneficial for them and for
other people on the way Mr
chairman that's all thank you
very much Representative next
will go to representative
Armstrong thank you Mr chairman
and madam chair I I'm curious
Marquita on on mine now sis it
says loans or grants.
How do you if what's the
difference and how the each
product does a project have you
decided to lower Grumman.
Thank you Mr Chairman
representative the water
transport looks for of minimum
contributions
from local sources and looks for
some kind of commitment from
alone so peach project is
anticipated that they will take
on some portion of the loan if
they don't however have of what
the utility ratepayer a lot of
those flood prevention projects
are on major roadways we don't
have
users that face those folks are
able to contributed an
additional match includes alone
so they can waive the loan by
increasing their local
contribution if they are utility
they have ratepayers the
expectation is that they will
have somewhere between a ten to
forty percent loan and we look
at their historic capacity to
repay that debt there are
communities that have
significant capacity to repay a
loan and so they'll be they'll
be assessed a higher loan and
those that don't have a lot of
repairs or not particularly
wealthy communities will be
assessed at ten percent anymore
okay thank you for that and then
so every project that was
offline for is in this is that
correct madam chair Mr chair
representative every qualify
projects so there may have been
an application for on behalf of
an entity that does not qualify
pursuant to the act they would
have been eliminated but every
qualified project by false
identity is represented here
this time that was the same as
last year's two years in a row
thank you for that I just
it's unfortunate I don't see any
of my counties here.
And so I was you know maybe they
didn't apply the they don't so
they whatever it is but
It's interesting.
But I could say that in in house
bill two which is going to the
Senate there's two hundred
thousand per each cost this year
and to higher rates and
technical assistance to to draft
these because you know some
people can go to water systems
together to perform different
and and I'll just like I think
the grant that I can't fix the
water system together so so we
have that now developed in the
budget
and and that was the whole
purpose to to help people with
technical assistance and grant
writers to the local I okay
thank you for that Mr chairman
and madam chair I
I just you know no one capital
outlay for the last I've been
here seven years.
Comaro needs a new.
Wastewater treatment.
You know it's not like a plant
is not a huge village of their
own accord  right if they don't
have the money and give them
piecemeal trying to get a plan
designed and everything before
they can even apply same thing
with the model late say thing
with the federal office so I was
I was just curious how that I
don't qualify.
Mr chair and Representative I'd
like to say thank you with the
passage of house and Senate bill
one last night we're now able to
regional allies and you now have
the grant writer so this is the
year to to get of all the state
agencies after districts to talk
about how you how you take an
idea to completion that's very
and and I what we're trying to
do is put the pieces in place so
that people do that and.
The NMFA has to has re written
there loan and grant writing
processes to allow more
flexibility for small systems
and that's that's who needs a
small system thank you yes and
I'm Mr chairman I was also
curious on some of these that
are in the area where there was
flooding.
Are they going to qualify for
federal funds and FEMA I hope
that we use of federal funds
first before we use our state
funds
I just noticed some of the areas
when I was just kind of scanning
through you know the in in Mara
County I see Senator in Rio.
Wherever there was up there was
the massive flooding I'm just
hoping that Mr chairman that we
access that federal funding for
four weeks state.
And I just I just want to say
We try to get that Mr chair and
representative we tried to get
that.
Copulating the year before and
couldn't do it and so I ate
along with a lot of
representatives in my district
put money into our call again I
just want you to know our return
on investment we hired the
beauty that the G. R. cocked
Education higher one gram she
had ten on the call okay so in a
matter six months we had sixty
million album requests and eight
point six million had come in in
the six month period with
gosh.
Of eight point six million have
come in and that's just in a
that's an.
It was kind of the proof of
concept if we do these **** and
do technical assistance and
grant writing and rural
unincorporated areas where they
don't have the capacity to do
that that then you can leverage
AI off of that disappoint the
leverage of lawn funds with that
so money got a grant three point
seven million in that in one of
in that category so they were a
and I knew that federal money
was coming in and I knew we
would have the capacity in rural
and incorporated areas and other
reason to build that capacity at
the local level we certainly
have people who can do it but
it's really putting in a system
and infrastructure together to
make that happen.
Mr chairman of I might one of
the agencies that reviews these
applications and makes the final
recommendation to of the water
trust board is the department of
finance administration so we
look at the funds are available
from federal sources that are
dedicated to projects like that
and we look at the capital
outlay bill to make sure that
we're not double funding any
particular project some of the
ones in those areas are designed
projects of this is the first
year in which we are providing a
hundred percent grant to small
systems designed only and I know
that several of them in those
areas are looking to design the
projects it may be that they're
trying to do them up for the
federal dollars when they're
available but I have to double
check okay thank you thank you
Mr chairman thank you.
Representative itself is Mr
chairman thank you very much
Representative Africa I noticed
That there is an emergency
clause attached to this.
So.
That's going to take two thirds
vote of the house floor is that
correct.
And I'm assuming that you've
already kind of talked people
and everything to make sure that
this does pass because it is
necessary that I and
Ship on on your side of the and
and hope that the members of
this committee will help us and
this is this is a full court
press cases Mr Chairman
representative as soon as it
signed it sign by the fourth
floor it will go into effect
thank you very much.
We'll go to representative of
all of thank you Mr chair market
and Representative.
Okay we get a little bit in the
servants Tax Court comes from
and how much the state gathers
up and how much is used on the
floor.
certainly
I know a little bit that really
messages to express solidarity.
So severance tax bonds chairman
or the the proceeds that come
from the severance of.
Bonds are issued backed by the
taxes on several oil and gas
this fund.
Nine percent distribution of
that spend the senior bonds of
the issue ten percent of that
moves on the and to the office
state engineer for education so
about eight point one percent of
the of the senior severance tax
funds are used to fund these
water projects and this year
that's the approximate just over
a hundred twenty one million
dollars.
Mr chair that's all the
questions I think.
This is surely to make a motion
for to pass I just have a
question.
The the the the for the
questions I got a question
myself of I see on the list that
they only into two years Sen
John Astle water conservation.
And in Liberia we use and
here again legislation that also
serves as a water source to
those qualify and then the email
starts on the state side then it
goes on to the reservation side
in my district so do they
qualify does the Indian nation
have to apply for themselves
it's a.
Mr chairman so certainly the
Indian nations are.
Of those tribes are all eligible
under the water project finance
act and we have funded many
through the water trust board
irrigation district depending on
how they're formed may be
eligible for a second
association that are of formed
as units of government to
special districts are eligible
there are I think of your area
particularly several of for
profit or not for profit
association that don't qualify
so I I don't remember particular
yours but if they are a secular
as if they are association
center for best special
districts they are eligible for
funding under the water
transport
and at the who applies for the
funds is really gonna be
maintains that project over the
useful life so there is a
requirement of the law that you
maintain the project for useful
life of these twenty years so
whoever that apple can be is the
one that's going efforts
secretary Kofi the state with
you all.
Of the act Representative
Kate's.
Representative have questions
okay thank you thank you Mr vice
chair of thank you of the
presentation
The percent of water at the
percent of those seniors
severance tax bonds that goes to
these projects is that set by
statute.
Mr buster Representative yes so
there's four and a half percent
to go to the trouble
infrastructure fund for to have
the caused the colonias
infrastructure fund and nine
percent that goes to the water
trust board but then again as I
said ten percent is shipped off
percent to statute and
Then it I'm sorry Mr chair
and presenters is.
This is my statues and ever
reviewed and is that percent.
Given climate warming and so
forth still inappropriate
percent.
Of these funds to be going to
water projects.
Mr chairman it was initially a
ten percent distribution has
been reviewed by the legislature
from time to time it is that to
to that nine percent whether
that's an appropriate amount I
think we would have to defer to
you on that there certainly
significant amount of need out
there we see that year after
year this
Mr chair of.
Repeatedly if there was more
money available we could be
putting more money into these
water projects is what I'm
hearing you say.
That they're
Mr chair of Representative I
think yes we have to work on a
type of pardon the pun but hi
Blaine of applications that
could use these dollars
efficiently there has been two
thousand seventeen the renewal
severance tax bonds directed to
water projects.
So it's because it's cyclical
and because it takes a year to
even get in there and you may or
may not end up in the funding
line they may and of as they did
in two thousand seventeen the
diverting a hundred percent of
the severance tax bonds other
uses it's it's a tough
applications like others that
lacks some predictability and
that has been a problem over
time these last two years
obviously there's been a
significant amount of funding
but you have to come with a full
in areas near the four in hand
have to observe your work so you
can't just decide to apply for a
lot of trust board there is a
significant amount of work that
is required to apply so you know
it would take us awhile to get
to the point that we could
tell our water systems this is a
predictable source of funding
that is not anticipated to go up
and down as much as it has in
the past and and here's what you
need to do to qualify.
And if I can just sit these
these these reports these
applications what a transporter
like this I mean it is it's a
huge engineering report it's
huge community were.
It's a long time for everybody
to agree that this
it's it's a piece of our
Clemente and and that's why I'm
trying to put money into grant
writing and technical assistance
in rural communities because HSD
at because it's not only the
supply it's really how do you
help the demand you know it I've
heard estimates as high as eight
million dollars to fix our water
systems in the state I mean it's
huge it's huge and that's
probably on the low side us so
so and that's not even
contending with drought and
climate change that would need
to speak to get drinking water
to every single household in a
in a safe manner so we've got a
lot of work to do.
Mr chair and madam chair I don't
know still managed care when
you're sitting at that.
Representative is fine.
Representative of the reason I'm
asking is because.
As we see the climate changing
and as we see the I mean water
is what.
And I'm wondering I mean so much
of government New Mexico is
based on I'm certain amounts
revenues when years the next
year it's bad and it makes
planning and putting things in
to actually getting projects
done very difficult
and I'm wondering in the area
water is this should be
something not this session this
something we should be looking
at in the future as some changes
in how this is allocated by
statute and
whether we could find research.
For our.
Communities in terms of making
some changes perhaps in statute
so that's.
I want to go into a huge long
conversation at this meeting
that kind of wanted to put that
on the table you can see if
that's something that for
example in the interim we should
have maybe looking at.
Mr chair representative I I
tried to get a bill at the three
years ago to do a severance tax
a four and a half percent for
rural unincorporated.
Because the big problems tribal
communities for taking care of
four and a half of las colonias
for taking care of four half but
the other states furrow and
corporate not care much math
many of the districts you all
Representative
and I said we have four and a
half percent severance for that
too it was not it was not
appreciated nor looked at very
very
Of the let's support highly so
I'm just saying I think there is
a need to that and I think we
should as interim committee at
look at that.
Thank thank you for this session
of the chair and.
Representative and ms Russell
I want to change gears here for
a second
So I'm looking at page seven and
items number fifty one fifty
seven relates to
The area that I represent and
No this is the language in all
of these is pretty much the same
regardless of where they're
being done.
And when I go back home and I
tell people all the wonderful
things that.
What sixty day.
I say
and
we're doing watershed
restoration and management
project.
So.
What that means in terms of what
kind what kind of thing of the.
What is a water storage
Conveyancing delivery project
watershed yes
the hearing report but it's just
one are we.
Everything and pipes are we.
Putting more.
Of the trying to read redo the
offered range plan is to Rahul
for I just kinda and would like
to be somebody asked me about
water I'd like to say well we
did watershed in could you call
Marquita Russel chief.
Mr Chairman representative water
conveyance the store to deliver
projects are the typical water
project the think of itself
pipeline projects in the water
storage tanks it is
it's it's your typical well
drilling of your water
conservation treatment or reduce
could be possible water off use
offset so someone replacing
possible water with greywater
could be treatment facilities is
so that is a category unto
itself some portions of that
category look a little like
waste water but waste water
projects in and of themselves
are not qualified flood
prevention projects are delayed
projects typically
when we see a damn that
typically is one falls into
water storage your water
restoration projects watershed
restoration projects are.
Salzgitter fittings there's
management of the watershed to
increase the flow of water is
actually making it to the
streets and not being kept in
the bank agency they're feeding.
The invasive species and then
lastly the federal one isn't
representative today as been
representative of the past is
implementation of the federal of
the dangers Species Act projects
and those are typically done by
the Interstate Stream
Commission.
Okay Mr chair and
Miss Russell one last question
you mentioned that where there
are rate payers of that these.
Funds are more likely to be
loans and I'm wondering if
that's true since we have
requires in county are these
loans to the Conservancy
district and water utility
authority is that likely to be
white structure
Mr Chairman representative I
think gets to the ongoing
project so virtually every
project from Bernalillo county
water utility of forty would be
backed by a right there because
that's what supports them city
of Albuquerque last year had
several projects that were in
that water conservation reuse
projects and they were done part
districts which don't have
haters so we're not looking at
whether the entity has a repair
utility we're looking at the
underlying project so I can't
tell you right off because I
knew I know that project
it was more complicated than
those of the watershed projects
so I can tell you right off
a little bit to get back to you
on that.
Thank you very much and Mr chair
that's on my questions.
The.
Excellent.
Part of that is school so.
This.
As thank you Mr chair I'd like
to make a motion for to pass.
The
resolve motion for the adoption

Thank you.
Good morning thank you.
This morning chairman and
committee members.
Thank you for hearing this
morning
I have to fill station for the
just the for your one.
And impairments with
Representative McQueen.
Fine with me I have my to
subject matter experts to my
left is Jessica Johnson chief
chief government officer for.
Federal protection New Mexico
and to my part is executive
director.
chief executive director of the
New Mexico website for.
so
madam chair committee members
with
Senate bill three oh one and I
do have that I can.
discussed when you're ready
it addresses and urgent matter
report regarding different
safety welfare state thank you I
thank you Mr I I make a motion
that we discuss the.
Okay.
Second there so what we'll take
up the amendment first okay very
good we like to do that take at
the end and then discussed above
the bill has been.
Okay.
Everybody.
This is a very small yes okay so
looks like on page two.
One two and three.
We are straight.
Or a course instead including
more of FY.
Also similarly cage to wind.
For striking what forces for.
And insert insert pardon me
inserts in there
What wines including.
Madam chair I made the reason
we're making this and that is
the next bill amends the the
same section of law and we're
making definition that involves
so for a technical.
Thank you for.
Watching from the question.
Mr chair Madam chairman and
senator and representative up.
On page nine hundred right to
set their.
Yes ma'am you take the stricken
forces in this.
Asserted there of equines
including captured free roaming
horses to the second use of
force need to be changed.
If we are to change.
All this issue.
Forces into the plans is the
likely change the very last word
of that sentence chairman and
representative very good
observation of the reason why we
have free roaming horse there is
because on page seven of the
bill.
We are defining on late one
twenty
three divide three really for.
Okay so that's why we're
including after three one point
thank you very much thank you.
I'd like to make most of the
except in this.
Our segment second officer any
opposition to that seeing this.
Of the of this mission to the
bill so for I thank you madam
chair
so.
I first learned about this
conundrum pretty early in my
starting back in my office we're
constituents were very concerned
about free roaming horses
that is.
They're certainly not wild.
And there's certainly not a
straight another they're not
belong to anybody right now
they're just really just trying
to make do with what they have
but anyway again in procedures
which is in my district Senator
strychnine.
There was an episode I think
some folks couldn't take care
Forces anymore and they abandon
their well then reproductions to
so now we have entirely too many
in the procedures area
the the the Sandoval county does
have a contract and they that
that contractor uses PZ he also
vaccine for mayors to help curb
of the reproduction none the
less the horses don't have
enough to eat.
Water is an issue.
And really most importantly for
me which concerns me every night
state have free access to
highway one sixty five this is
the main artery to and from
procedures the bill to proceed
us and in fact we have had
conflicts with horses and
vehicles
were by the forces have have had
to be euthanized
And I I just just the way the
the rules are members I re
spirit that we're gonna have a
casualty with human are very
serious injury.
Now since I learned about this
matter in my district madam
chair committee members it's my
understanding the real DELLOSO
has a similar conundrum whereby
the free roaming horses there
are hanging on the golf courses
and other places and similarly
they are concerned for safety of
both horses and humans
so we think
Representative and I think this
is it's not a perfect bill but
it really starts to address the
matter of whereby.
The state can have what we
propose a force experts which
should be contracted by the New
Mexico legislature for.
And this our expert would assist
livestock for and us all of us
to care about this about
perhaps.
Transporting the the free
roaming horses to eleven percent
were.
Not to get this started good
footing the representative I had
and I have appropriated junior
money a hundred seventy five
thousand dollars.
To help the livestock.
Get a good start.
and then there after I've
pledged to help the director and
her staff secure additional
funding for FY twenty four.
I think I will
I'm gonna pass the.
The my to my representatives and
subject matter of fact experts
because I think I've given you
the summary thank you very much
thank you senator Madam chair
and members of the committee
this this bill is not a
comprehensive free from our
management proposal simply is
well I've scrubbed all sort of a
pressure relief valve so where
there are too many horses where
they're impact rain where
In the healthy population size
it provides an Avenue to adopt
and relocate some of the forces
it won't be all the horses
there's one of the places they
can go there's a lot of the from
members of people who are
willing to adopt a descending
while our so this is just trying
to try to help with the
population Sir Elton was in the
right direction and I I think
it's a good bill thank you madam
chair members.
Thank you Representative doing
your experts is yes thank you
madam chair representative I
just wanted to introduce
ourselves and add to the
conversation.
Thank you senator good morning
madam chair and committee
members and Jessica Johnson with
animal protection voters and
likewise mentions it this is not
a comprehensive solution we've
been working on a comprehensive
solution for years it's become
apparent that it's going to take
many more years to build
consensus and the needed
resources along with all of the
stakeholders and so in the
meantime you know there are many
areas of the state where there
are free roaming horses that
lived without incident left
there for decades if not
centuries in in the more remote
places state they are more while
this behavior but then there are
places like she doesn't really
know so we're the very
acclimated to humans and so then
they get a lot more attention
because there are conflicts at
work.
so and what we at what this bill
seeks to do is rather than
overhauling current twelve point
law
it is really more as a framework
same exact outcomes for our.
that are in eight the current
law would exist in this bill as
well as about fertility control
and for courses that are removed
from the landscape of they can
go to they can be adopted
through a rescue at in this bill
they could go to.
for the the humanely euthanized
only for severe health
conditions so I really want to
emphasize you know there are
concerns with this issue I don't
you know we we share and many of
the kids love for a while the
free roaming horses and is
concerned that this bill is
going to result in mass
euthanasia or mass removal and
that's simply not the case
because the actual building
which would not allow for that.
The bill also does not
categorize these forces FY
stopped there is that they have
their own definition in state
law
but what this bill does do is it
maintains the status quo of the
livestock board at the two
factors oversee agency because
the current while our law exists
within the livestock code it
that it seventy seven eighteen I
that is by default administered
by the livestock board so at
this bill keeps that but it is a
few important things that will
allow for some of the locations
which again current law already
contemplated it will allows
relocations to actually happen
because they've never actually
happened through
that the the pathways that are
laid out in state law
one it clarify several aspects
of the process one of them being
that it removes a DNA test of
for each our groups that
currently does not specify what
percentage of.
Oakland is required to be
considered a Spanish colonial
force but if one was that the
help the only outcome for that
was to go to a rescue for
importation dedicated to
preserving Spanish forces they
don't exist in New.
Further at the the entity that
is in current law that is
charged with really disability
includes on the ground fertility
control and and relocation of
and other management aspects is
the University of New Mexico
museum of southwestern biology
We've been in touch with that we
have a letter from them stating
we have no idea what we were
this is a lot to do this work
we've never done and we don't
want to do it we don't plan to
do it please remove us and so
that's what this bill does.
So what the the final important
thing that I want to point out
is qualified for the moving
force experts and and what this
bill contemplates is that it's
not
of a contractor it's not an FTP
the last four what it is is a
new licensing scheme for someone
who is a qualified individual
needs qualifications can be
reviewed and approved by the
last four as a licensee and then
they can work with other
entities throughout the state to
about the fertility control and
facilitate any humane the
locations that are needed
so we are you know it's strong
support of of this bill is been
happy to work with the bill's
sponsors on this
as much of the pressure release
valve of because we do think
that it is for the benefit of
the course thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee most of you know
availability garland I'm the
executive director for the
livestock board so we do support
this bill we do not think that
this is cure all or fix all that
but we do believe that this is a
step forward and it's proactive
in protecting resources
as many of you have heard the
stories there's a lot of the
stand in the road to get here at
the roll longer wild because I
never going to the flicks sieges
forces I never seen them
personally but I have seen the
whole season right also they
stand on the roads and people to
be.
When it's draft season and
there's no for each people feed
their tally survive so we think
that these forces along with
every species that the
statehouse needs some type of
control and protection so they
don't really fall under the the
faces are not wild not
considered wildlife so we see
this as a stab that are first
here on we're gonna reach
Management Agency also do you
know so we don't have that type
of expertise that our agency so
we're gonna have to go
contractors and people that can
give us guidance on exactly what
this while our experts should
know and how we've just put
rules in place to licenses in
order to help control the
population and given the sources
of our life so that's basically
where we stand I think Jessica
did a really good job of
explaining all of those and we
do support for that reason thank
you thank you
Would you like to read Senator
thank you madam chair simply
that
we consider this urgent like I
say it's a so thank you for the
horses there welfare human
safety and I Representative are.
Really want to ensure there are
no more complex accidents many
of the horses get the welfare.
That.
Thank you very much thank you
I'm sorry Madam chair
representative one thing the
reason we also think that this
bill is important as you all are
aware of the granting of the
cattle in the wilderness of
happened so we as a livestock
were already beginning to get
calls that people are shooting
neighbors livestock I think it's
okay.
So we already on the counter one
is this this past weekend so we
think that a step forward to
protect the sources it's very
important.
Thank you for that I think it's
kind of a problem okay we'll go
to the audience now how many are
in favor of this bill.
pose.
Okay this is okay will start the
first row with those support
We wish to speak I should.
How many ways.
I like.
Yes Santa Fe County of which is
not the only county that has
this problem if you've heard
Senate bill three awarded
dresses category of courses
following praxis Mexico
statutes.
Your own horses are not wildlife
and analyzed here is the state
oversight of at this time and we
need
there are a lot of free roaming
horses out there and they are
the responsibility of the state
under the public trust Dr in the
seat is there are a hundred
seventy five of these free
roaming horses they're free
roaming on private properties on
seventy miles of county roads
and on state highway sixty five
in the last eleven years thirty
state horses have died on state
highway one sixty five and
county roads in this.
And.
the state through the direction
of this legislation needs to
give guidance as to how to deal
with this important public
safety environmental issues.
No there are feral hogs The New
Mexico we know this and are
feral cows in New Mexico.
And you.
Thank you Sir yeah we're trying
to work on equipment thank you
appreciate your support thank
you and I should announce that
before thank you very much the
next person speaking in support
madam chair members of the
committee weddings the Roberts
are all small and she will see
this with models we always have
between twelve to three free
roaming horses on our property.
Our property outside of this
city has been destroyed no
longer grasses in the area for
the horses to the water
increases on straight we don't
want our sister go to slaughter
the injured or killed goals for
start.
We do not want to motor private
property for the purpose there's
nothing we can do that the
horses costs conflicts between
neighbors historical landscape
frighten people because property
and vehicle damage under current
statutes we cannot legally
relocate thanks for suitable
places the free roaming horses
not just hired miss animals at
the fair thank you thank you
very much yes thank you madam
chair members.
My advice for Sunday executive
director New Mexico counties and
this is an issue we've been
struggling with for years
especially after the herd was
removed and we had a few years
ago it is a contentious issue
people both passionately about
what they consider their
particular wild herds and at the
same time we have for homeowners
who are concerned we work
Senator was as well as with the
advocates of this bill during
the interment realty is County
shelters are not set up for
anything more than companion
animals we think it's important
that statute has some authority
and someone who can make the
decisions about whether
appropriations for courses so
with that we stand very strong
support this bill thank you
thank you is there anyone else
you'd like to speak in support
of the bill.
All right we'll turn to those
who want to speak against the
bill yes ma'am.
I just want to start this
program and founder and
president of wild horses.
By central county government
that people see this can't be on
anything however we reviews we
agree that we if you refuse to
allow our wild horses to wipe
them for to be we need something
other than wild which will not
be reserves and there's no
mechanism in these go for
preservation I work and there
are procedures in the state the
truth is what we all agree on
policy does eighty six percent
of us agree that we want them
fighting could pull we want them
in our communities they are all
fat and happy there's no issue
as far as accidents over here
how rages up to seventeen
actually it's hits provided for
here CBS in total pain which is
half the year in higher reason
have forces is point one degree.
Yes per year this is a major
issue there's no cannot from.
This time thank you very much
thank you for your presentation
next the next person who wishes
to speak against this bill.
Madam chair members of the
committee remains to we have
Mexico counselors of Wilder's
stand opposed to Senate bill
three oh one to the purpose of
calling feral horses free
roaming horses we also don't we
also do not agree that she's
away the use of motorized
vehicles the use of having a
good idea because actually
inspected them much needed
mannerisms.
we can all agree that federal
forces pose an issue for fix
this problem we must manage
part of management's going
apples that hinder development
of the heard that would include
harvesting whole forces and
later of this be put to
beneficial use that would far
outweigh done due to starvation
of the plan some of the concerns
that we have our what is option
or suitable iPhone talking about
what will happen to these access
forces and what will happen is
determined can't pass the
season.
Thank you thank.
Another person.
Yes their use size size.
And I'm eighty five years old
and I was raised resources.
I was born and raised in the
data.
might I have families this past
I have allergies.
And that I'm very proud of this
administration and I still have.
And other ideas and animals.
They water all the water on the
line the releases of course
there and we'll see you know you
we have decided to act up there
that they.
You know I don't have anything
against Philip Morris is I wish
that there was just a little and
and the and the most important
thing for me yes that they have
enough water that there's
they're finding the water from
the fees up there is violence
that will be called up there.
For.
All the birds going there is
that all the elements is not the
state yes thank you thank you
for your testimony we have one
margin thank you madam chair
thank you for your question.
Well this bill.
Thanks to this little laws for
the removal of some questions.
This is not a statewide problem.
Support this is an all see this
no of course it's been mentioned
that this is not a cure all
fixed also we have not been of
contact on.
Else to be part of the
discussion for this
also fertility control could be
an option
but if.
With that right now.
And this is for.
Government.
And on the issues that we hear
now is that we issued.
Going into their domain the
store.
That is so we should take
consideration who was there
first and.
As a problem for the speedy
Cincinnati.
Thank you so very much is there
anybody else in the audience I
think we have one percent off
all three people on staff I
thank you everybody relating to
the observation that and we'll
start with
I think.
Came back to the.
Yes.
Four of those.
Yes I'm directing to the our
senators what introduced in
those that are supporting the
bill when will you be holding
public meetings implicit us are
to discuss this with more of the
population here the residents
here and what are your
intentions as far as possibly
conducting a new survey with the
residents implicit just as we're
speaking on the bill so you need
to speak up so this is regarding
a bill because they perhaps the
senators are introducing you to
hold meetings here in posi test
to see what their constituents
constituents support and do not
support I was just possibly at
the public library.
Okay thank you and we'll go to
our next the
There's a joint for our
Representative.
There's.
Thank you madam chair thank you
it and committee members
please listen to the opposition
having the livestock bureau in
charge of the horses is a
conflict they already have been
party to capturing the alcove or
heard your re adjust so that
they the people that we're
trying to protect the also heard
finally were able to get
released a few years ago by
going to court and NMSU
management will have excessive
land requirements than is
necessary and they will be able
to justify removing the horses
this is
Not only
you know trying to remove the
wild horses from their natural
habitat but there are other
places in other states that have
been able to encourage and help
develop state parks such as the
Salt River in a Phoenix area as
a wonderful reserve where the
horses were naturally there as
free roaming thank you
Representative we appreciate
your us.
Thank you we'll go to the next
speaker of Sheryl.
Thank you for this opportunity
the NOPD has a clear conflict of
interest with wild orchard if a
law firm has a conflict of
interest in the case the law
firm cannot take the cake.
Senator savant has openly stated
on the Senate floor during a
hearing regarding SB three oh
wait that quote we do people
with words close put these bills
are master works of giving MLB
has we believe demonstrated that
it is not honorable both in
court actions against the animal
abuse since two thousand seven
and prior to two thousand seven
when it extirpated our state
while girls and parents well
felt after the wild free roaming
horses and burros act passed.
There are no reserves or
reserves for wild horses
we tried to create a reserve in
twenty nineteen whoa did but no
reserve was created and no
further action was taken the the
eight PNM did nothing right
thank you Sir thank you for your
testimony will now go on to.
Marty.
The.
Hyatt's Marty Murphy I
appreciate the time to talk the
thing that I find sorely lacking
in those who promote this bill
and it it's definitely and it's
so loud is they're not talking
about how these horses have been
hit the most recent more that
was killed in proceed as I read
the report it was a distracted
driver.
Then there was a our kids in
December of twenty twenty one
and the man was going between
clock to be going between
seventy to ninety miles an hour
at seven o'clock in the morning
and I myself have had run across
forces but I drive the speed
limit and drive below it and it
troubles me greatly and I keep
saying this and it never seems
to be heard is we're not
addressing that in regards to
this as well and I think that is
sorely lacking and needs to be
part and I also agree they're
not asking any of us that live
here locally how we feel about
it and I feel meetings are
necessities thank you for that
thank you an average just our
last to speaker of the chamber.
Yes thank you so much for the
opportunity I support this bill
the free roaming horses are a
problem they continue to grow in
numbers and with that they do
not have sustainable resources
to keep them alive so I
absolutely support this and urge
you to support it as well.
Thank you thank you.
Okay now we will turn to the
committee and for some of this
with is that Representative
these the staff and then okay
and then we'll have
Representative kids and
Representative.
Thank you madam chair.
Appreciate helping day.
Director garland is jobs.
I was just wondering what we're
whenever we were talking about
the strays over the animal
protection voters where were you
the and this happened last year
and we had a half of this year.
Our side of the issue and that
was nothing more than cruelty
New York did nothing so I am
reprimanding you of that members
here on going on speaking on
those those cattle were not
referred to as.
Feral cat those are straits and
that is codified in our statutes
regarding the livestock board
said there is a big difference
there these horses that we have
a window so are not wild horses
madam chair they are feral horse
the sources have been turned
years they came from others that
no longer want them anymore.
They have been hit by cars that
were obeying the speed limit.
And one of them happened last
summer under the gavel in canyon
road I was following a pick up
truck we were doing less than
thirty miles an hour with the
speed limit posted a thirty I
went around a curve into horses
came up the hill side and ran
into the pick up.
Obviously breaking the lead
horses leg and it was an ugly
sight to see and we had to wait
until we can get a veterinarian
there but the or staff.
It posed a threat not only to
the people on the on coming side
of traffic the to the people
that were riding in the pickup.
And so somebody will get killed
I know that one of the there is
been is three way split of those
forces in the rid us out area
that were gathered by the lot of
stop working because they were
in treating up property these
horses were tied brought up here
said feis correct me if I'm
wrong Representative garland
they were too they were returned
through a court order they were
held in private captivity until
those Harper said we can't
afford feed him anymore.
Madam chair it's become a pain
in the **** for those homeowners
at their for the sources to be
able to run more ever they want
to.
During the winter months
whenever there's snow all over
the ground up there they go
without food because all the
Texans have gone home and they
no longer feet.
Madam chair that one band of the
horses have hit the downtown
area.
Ministers thank you really need
and the property owners don't
want down there.
Whenever we're talking about the
soccer players and.
All players at the local
community areas there.
They can be replaced Socorro
those bills anymore because of
the amount of course then they
were that is all over the place.
I personally with one band that
was all intact at the time I
still have pictures some of
those if you want me to verify
that a full month and a set of
twenty eight courses in my home
at my house up in the mountains
in that area.
They have.
Destroyed my outdoor lighting
they have of broken the record
for the satellite dish they have
positive my drip irrigation
system because I like to
conserve water.
And they are nothing more than a
passing that's all they are.
Mr chair Madam chairman and
senator and representative
twenty three you're talking
about allowing for fertility
control of these.
Abandoned feral horses in New
York more detail on that.
Care.
Representative our test is
It's PCP.
It's a Indio contraception
that's used for the mayor's and
currently Sandoval County has
under contract for I think about
thirty six thousand dollars a
year
Has contacted the company to do
that and it's my understanding
and please correct me mistrusted
Fund wrong that the
effectiveness of PCP it is
between ninety ninety five
percent.
Madam chair I know exactly what
this is how's it did stir.
Madam chair and senator madam
chair and representative I want
to defer to Mr Johnson because I
have not actually seen the the
adminstration of the vaccine
okay.
Madam chair representative is
out it's at something like what
you would call it a dark fast
that's exactly right is so
handsome you're not really sure
madam chair it's everywhere that
they do hit with the start of it
does tech so there analyze the
problem because whenever he
said.
Ninety five percent is effective
at big to differ with that
because if one more gets hit
with if they're in a band and
one more get set with that she
jobs is startled resumes will
take up so.
That PCP PCP vaccine is not
worth it where we madam chair
and senator Representative why
are we going to.
I don't know maybe Harding
these.
A fandom for feral horses up
free roaming horses.
Maybe gelding.
Some of the mails.
Because some of those feral
horses that are up in rid us of
our kids so that does prove that
once upon a time they were on.
And I think that's very very
clear.
So well I'd like an explanation
of that.
Madam chair representative yeah
what we do have included in
fraternity to to control is
castration for the stallions
average of the first to fund
director garland for Mr Johnson
to talk more about the.
Russian.
What we've talked about
everything else all just go
ahead.
Reference.
Madam chair members of the
committee I think that would be
part of what we try to figure
out what this expert Channell
how is the best way to control
the population is it easy is a
castration is a relocation I I
think that because like I said
we are not rage Management
Agency that's what we're gonna
try to figure out.
What to what to the
qualifications the what should
this person no in order to
control populations twelve three
relocation and all the other
things along.
Madam chair thank you very much
and I do think that that's a
very viable options and that
does.
Help.
Control the size that heard
along with adoption.
And there's several adoption
agencies out there that will
take these forces that will take
care of.
my son and his wife that for
those they have taken in a
couple of that the abandoned and
neglected horses they have a
couple of many donkeys there
they have a meal there and they
are working with them get them
back in shape feeding them back
up one is beautiful right be in
our.
The almost starved to death.
So there is there are means
there to help the sources and
I'm not being made no media okay
of course if anybody knows me
they know what my passion.
It's real simple.
But I'll be damned if I'm gonna
have people killed one of these
horses run into cars because
whenever you had a course guess
what happens most often than not
it goes through the windshield
of that car.
Eight thousand ballots to human
life versus of course.
It's up to you all.
Some of the questions I have of.
I'm not quite following what you
mean these horses are not
covered under the livestock and
after all that yesterday I made
a copy of it because I know this
livestock.
Last of all domestic
domesticated animals mysteries
of farm and ranch and exotic
animals in captivity and
includes horses **** mules
cattle sheep goats swine I need
us to just the straight
scandalous and farm service.
Does not include K. nine
surveillance.
So we're just gonna line did
something else because we want
to make something else they're
feral horse madam chair.
And Senator Representative.
It's not that I'm opposed.
To what the billion has done
with those particular course I'm
not not opposed to that that
some of the in.
But whenever we have landed that
have it been impacted the way
that they have.
It's impossible my neighbors
thank you for how many years ago
it's been now seven or eight
years ago whenever times were
pretty tough people could not
afford to feed their dog season
because all the dogs would be
adept at my neighbors who have
not had a horse on their
property since nineteen seventy
three when it to one of their
past years that they were like
having they were resting at the
time.
Somebody could care for their
horses and turned six sources
out there.
That what that is the reality of
what's at that's how these.
Federal forces came about at the
rid of so.
One of the bands in the right
does so here in this madam
chairman.
And representative and senator.
One of the bands that was up
there there was an old there
still is a little static there
is pretty big.
Three years ago.
Whenever the herds gotten being
fun they'll split up I guess
people do the same thing I
suppose thanks to the bands did
split up.
It was just one of those to two
young studs probably two years
old and one Philly that wasn't
even a year of.
And before she was two years
Ezzell she had a coat nine of
the that that it was this is
printed all over that baby's
face.
There is no birth control for
that more.
That'd be like ten year old have
the debate.
Madam chair for.
While your attention is our kids
miss Johnson.
We have to care for these
animals.
They originated as domestic
animals.
There are people out there that
want to have a force this is the
way that the livestock board.
Could help those people it is
stated in this bill that they
the sources could not be sold
for slaughter every one of the
sources that they removed from
the rid us area has been shipped
they cannot be used for
slaughter.
There's not a lot of plants for
our system the United States.
So now all the sources that do
does have to be euthanized or
for whatever reason they're no
longer with this.
Is I have a question for you
Representative incident is this
going to be a problem.
Is there going to be some sort
of M. environmental impact one
of the sources start by.
In the red also area it took
three days for somebody to come
pick up that point that I was
talking about that has led broke
horses body decomposes just like
a human does that fast so I'm
kind of curious to do all seat
is just being an environmental
impact whenever the sources get
here because they're out they're
just going wherever they want
to.
Madam chair representative
I understand the question.
So when of course is hit by a
vehicle.
are you asking what is more
mental impact of the forces park
just riding there is
So sure can well it's it's a
natural process but because I
haven't come across states of
course I I'd like to defer to
Director garland to answer that
question please.
So madam chair of Representative
Ezzell.
I would think that would be a
case by case basis if they die
out in the forest the predators
or
Other pros they'll decompose
actually
they can but they can dial Water
Street that could happen.
So which can affect the water
qualities and the fish and
wildlife and water.
So I think that would probably
have to be a case by case basis.
Get.
Madam chair thank you
Representative director garland
for that response.
Senator and Representative.
They're good areas of your bill
of their betters if your bills
that you know what the sources
that are out there free roaming
feral whatever you want to call
at this point.
Some of them get.
Sicknesses that they can't be
treated for.
What would be the course of
action if there is such a malady
that does affect the band of
Force.
Some of these horses do suffer
before they die so my question
to you is or to Mr Johnson are
correct that this correct of
course I know that several years
ago the H. B. one virus that hit
the Center park area it crippled
over little gosh thank what was
that eight hundred horses that
they could not move they had
stated that facility because the
quarantines that will fit in
place at they do not receive a
Coggins
with the caucus part of it thank
you with the other.
About twelve years ago this yes
six thank you for what that
particular disease was that
horses know our was allowed to
move within the state yet these
Verrall free roaming forces
we're able to potentially
spreading.
A virus that was lethal to our
so I do have a concern there and
whenever I'm talking about a
concern I'm not talking about
your average.
These horses that are.
Written by young people for
pleasure I think that's one
thing but whenever we're talking
about a rope course that is in
excess of fifty thousand dollars
that's a major investment this
just lost because of these
horses have the ability to go
where ever they want so there is
a problem there I would rather
see these horses humanely taken
care and that is not left out in
the cold during the blizzard to
starve to death with no water.
To be run over by vehicles to be
hit by a semi that's going down
the highway to be turned loose
to become somebody else's
problem and that's what it says.
Seven miss madam chair.
I understand what you're trying
to do here I am very.
Curious to hear what the other
members have to say about this
and the final review on this so
madam chair thank you very much
thank you Representative
Representative Kate's.
Thank you madam chair and and
Representative I just wanted to
clarify some things a lot of
conflicting information flying
about one is is
your expert witness from more
protection voters.
She said they do not exist so
Spanish colonial forces do not
exist in the state of New Mexico
or there is no reserves for
Spanish colonial forces in the
state of New Mexico which one.
Madam chair representative K.
thank you for the opportunity to
clarify I was referring to the
preserve Center that or that
organizations that are dedicated
to preserving Spanish colonial
forces those do not exist okay
so the thank you madam chair and
representative so at one point
you had said they were a Levin
force for service throughout New
Mexico is that correct.
Madam chair representative cases
there are eleven of course
rescuer retirement facilities
that are currently registered
with the New Mexico livestock
for they are inspected and
licensed by the board
so those eleven organizations to
excess they by and large focus
more so on domestic forces but
there are a couple of the
organizations that are very
experienced in being able to
take
it free from horses
that have been captured stands
cannot be returned to the land
and they're able to inject them
and train them a little bit and
I drive homes thank you madam
chair representative of the the
P. C. P. I under right here that
it's ninety ninety five percent
effective for how long.
Madam chair and representative
case of so typically that the
current type of PC key that is
used to quickly requires an
annual booster there are
reports that after so many years
it may have a permanent effect I
am more
and there is also a sort of a at
version two point now of PC that
is in development there's talks
about it being able to reach the
market in the near future that
would last for two weeks thank
you madam chair representative
so currently the birth control
would have to be administered in
yearly correct madam chair and
representative K. yes and and
that is what's happening in
Sandoval county as a Senator
McKenna mentioned there's a
contractor that for
the for the state has been doing
an annual survey of the heard
their and administering the
everywhere that they see you
sing all numbers go from double
fits down to single digits so it
is pretty effective in slowing
population growth thank you
madam chair representative and
senator
Can you tell me so this bill is
my understanding is that it says
that you're going to.
Capture but not the entire to
it's it's a.
It's a step by step sure we
locate individual owners for
screens places we know that
they're not being harvested for
food if they're not being sold
to different countries
so when you say they're going to
be captured how do we is there
is there percentage sure the and
the number that will be captured
in a certain time period
systematically.
Madam chair and representative
I do not know that number we're
going to be leaning on the our
expert that gets licensed but
because director garland is so
experienced with that she might
have some more insight for that
question chair if I may so the
the issue with capturing them as
yet that's a place to take.
Yes to some of the top them or
or some place really relocate
them and that's why I would
anticipate the number of forces
there captured in this bill the
relatively small which is you
know one of the objections right
so we we've heard from people
that is to say this goes to
parking after all our is and
we've heard from people that say
it doesn't go far enough we
should be slaughtered horses
this is somewhere in.
Thank you thank you
Representative I wanted to
leases humane on on page A.
section five humane euthanasia
how often is is this our experts
at least visually inspecting
the free roaming horses on it I
mean how do they know that they
have a disease or require at
least a further
Further examination sermon
whether or not they need to be
mainly euthanized.
R. Madam chair representative
did you reckon that to one of us
in particular.
Of the Evers the most okay
Senator okay director garland
please and madam chair
Representative Kate that that's
a that's a really good question.
So there's a lot of factors that
come in controlling any of
livestock the weather is free
roaming horses or cattle or
whatever
horses are no different than we
are the age so you if an expert
is after watching these horses
in the age and they can see that
maybe there are more oil than
not shedding in the summertime
they're repair is rough and so
those are all telltale signs
that maybe they're not getting
enough nutrients or that they're
aging forces T. sometimes they
get involved they can process
the food properly so that's all
within the parameters of the sex
for decades they watch these
animals and they kind of
children how these
Phil this is like the one virus
that Representative he's always
talking about the possible
listers Malthe can eat so those
are tell tale signs of an expert
would be able to see specific
thank you.
Madam chair and and and Dr
garland and and I'm and no
questions or as well and so I'm
just asking how often do you
intend this expert to be
visually inspecting the free
roaming horses is there is there
any protocol if if it's there
just feigning the heard once a
year or are the visually
inspecting them once a month I
don't know that's that's when
I'm asking.
So madam chair a Representative.
The free roaming our expert to
be clear is not an employee of
the New Mexico I support it's
not just the it's a it's a
category yeah so it's someone
who can step up there's some
question do you want to get paid
yeah probably and as you know
Sandoval County ari has
contracts with with our experts
are not of course qualified
under this bill because I mean
the fact yet but that's the kind
of arrangement we would
anticipate so it's a bit adhoc
right it's not as we said you
know from the get go this isn't
a comprehensive solution.
It's it's an opportunity to care
for some of the horses to Dobson
the horses to re locate some of
the questions.
I thank you madam chair one last
question Senator
So the Representative said at
the very beginning The
presentation that this is the
first step the first step to be
able to address this dangerous
situation.
are you able to share with us
whites your overall plans may be
for this particular issue.
madam chair and representative
thank you for the question if I
had my druthers
I'd like to we look at what to
governor bill bill Richardson
had as an idea and that is
the state our sanctuary.
A learning center sanctuary
shelter for worse's and open to
the public.
yeah you State Land I mean
that's might that be by like I
said if I had my druthers I I
would just love to see us to do
that really bring the public and
to learn about horses and how to
care for them
but that would be a big piece of
property.
that was the if I could do that.
If I could paint a picture of
what I would like to do that's
what it would be so madam chair
sorry I'm speaking one else and
then so Senator have used
started location scouting for
conversations with stakeholders
and identifying a space for this
vision.
Madam chair representative yes
there have been I have one
conversation with a landowner in
New Mexico that is interested to
do something like this and then
a few weeks ago I was presented
with another huge ranch that
could possibly be used for this
as well but again that's a
really long term goals this we
believe is a good start.
Thank you madam chair of the
representative Armstrong thank
you madam chair and thank you
for The presentation it's it's
kind of unique to see all the
different sides of what's going
on and and try to put all the
pieces together so it's it's
interesting that that you know
Irvin this is mainly for urban
because I have some wild horses
out madam chair and Riley New
Mexico you can you know thirty
to fifty had that.
They get to run in and heard and
it's pretty detrimental to for
it.
And fences
but but they are beautiful I
mean with that said so
one of the other things are I
was curious about I'm sure madam
chair that you know noxious
weeds local we it you know I've
seen cattle I see horses on
local we in the spring before
the grass starts coming and
before you know they're roaming
free or whatever
what that count as something if
they couldn't get over it with
that be something that you know
if they ate to much of it and
had to be euthanized.
Chair.
Representative so that counts as
as an illness but difficult to
recover from it.
Madam chair representative I'm
not sure I don't know what the.
What happens is both our and
just local we director garland.
So that is here Representative
Armstrong you know as well as I
do a lot of times are going here
for local so humane taxation
probably would be required there
are instances where you can get
on past it but locally to animal
is kind of like Carol interview
they go back to.
So it would be if you got there
pass that initial addiction then
you would probably need to put
them in the sanctuary of home
thank you thank you madam chair
there's just a lot more to it
than some people think you know
further down the road that that
can happen to these animals and
so as as private property owners
madam chair and and
Representative do they have any
recourse of in this bill.
If they are
You know safer to twenty five
gets on some private property do
they have any recourse now or in
the bill.
Madam chair representative
so I just wanted to Senate
president.
We have the resources for your
property private property owners
okay so.
So can you kind of just steer me
what what
okay thank you madam chair yes
so I have two hundred acres
private property of the the wild
herd gets to run and run through
the fence and come talk to my
private property.
Do I have any recourse first of
all to get them off second of
all to have any kind of
reimbursement for the damage and
thirdly any reimbursement for
the grant and the point that
they're eating that are
competing with my possible
livestock I have to be eating
that.
I.
Madam chair representative so
that's really interesting
because I'm I'm I think in the
first question is how is the
fence down in the first place
madam chair they ran through the
fence and ran through the fence
okay.
For yes for.
So so madam chair
Representative certain you know
as private land there you're not
required to have them on your
property but there's no state
agency or no public body that
will take him off right so you
know you might have to
reconstruct or soft prepare your
friends and that's that's part
of the damage that the larger
doing that we're trying to
address as to the other two
questions
do you have a couple finally
remember one of recourse as to
the value of the forage answers
no.
You don't so again what we're
trying to do in this bill is.
Reduce the size of the.
Not all of the benefits we don't
think we have enough places to
put the worst but to bring the
numbers down so situations like
that happen less frequently.
Okay thank you thank you madam
chair and and can I ask on page
eight why
When you need to to gather the
R. or capture.
These forces why the use of
aircraft and motorized vehicles
cannot be used for.
Madam chair representative thank
you for the question yeah it's
it's been observed that using
aircraft.
Or the ATVs startles and
terrifies forces which could
lead to serious injury
just curious they have to be put
down and so we want to gather
than in a humane way I'm not
using aerial aircraft or ATVs
thank you madam chair thank you
Madam chair.
Miss Johnson is there something
else going on Madam chair
representative are I could just
add the the other thing to
consider is in this scenario
where you would be capturing
horses it's most likely it's to
relocate them to the doctor's
home our reserves and what the
data shows from other gathers is
when you do the low stress
at capturing Mathis they are
behavior early much easier to
handle and and much more ready
to go to the doctor comes thank
you madam chair thank you for
the
But I just find it really
interesting you know I'm I'm
about.
conservation.
About of taking care of the
animals but I'm also about
private property.
And it's it's interesting that
this scenarios coming where you
know I have several scenarios on
my private ranch where I have a
roll on my.
That are detrimental to marker
of capital.
Nobody seems to be hearing that
but here we are with a bill to
help control something else.
So just need people to remember
that and think about that.
When there's issues in rural New
Mexico that are detrimental to
us thank you madam chair thank
you anymore questions.
I just had a question and I
guess it's about piece of the
same features that you're
talking about I'm curious is
there a level how many courses
in the they could be that right
Madam chair for to be then this
farmers Johnson I'm not sure
what their capacities thank you
so madam chair that's a that's a
good question actually their
capacity is
location could be depended upon
there's only requirements so.
I personally have not been to
all of them but our state
nearing assistant she goes out
every year to inspect them to
make sure that all of the
animals and the facility with
private condition.
So it really just depends I
think there's some there's a
pretty good sized one it's one I
know that they're really good
facility they've been there a
long time so.
I think your slices depending
upon kind of workout.
So is there a census are you
talking about.
You know five hundred horses are
talking about you know fifty
that's that's I guess I'm trying
to get some idea of the scope
you know so madam chair I I
think I'm gonna have to be
honest I really don't know the
answer to that I think that this
the livestock board I think our
role in this is that we create
the guidelines curry the roll
over to license the specialists
that will that will kind of lead
us to.
property and.
This is
a yes madam chair and madam
chair we I do have numbers from
a survey
That the rescues conducted
amongst themselves from twenty
twenty one so it at and the
number that they have for their
total five rescue population and
twenty twenty one was two
hundred.
All right well if I know I have
one more question and just
looking at the time to we still
have one more bill on the table
I'm just going to say that it is
not often that I see animal
protection in the livestock or
together on the same panel and
whenever I see that and I'm kind
of inclined to go there are you
know I don't know at UNM this is
the perfect bills that have with
that
representatives have one more
question yes ma'am I do have a
madam chair and senator and
representative many years ago
one over to the to
administrations ago there was
this because there was a big
problem at the Navajo Nation
with the federal forces sent
there and member service center
and I can't remember who the
president was at that time this
is under Richard Simmons
scratch.
Of he and I were visiting and
subject of the horses came at
because there was a bill to do
something about all those feral
horses up there.
And if memory serves me right
there eight thousand feral
horses in the Navajo Nation.
That's what that was I hate to
tell you how many years ago that
was nineteen of the.
Those horses were starved to
death and governor Richard some
filters best interest to gather
model of all the federal forces
that they were and the.
Use taxpayer dollars in there
were I was one of those people
that was supposed to be because
this is not supposed to be the
burden of the taxpayers of the
state of New Mexico to see fifty
seven miles.
It is somebody that didn't have
the means may be to take care
didn't absolutely want to could
not do anything else with a
because they could not there was
no sign of slaughterhouse forces
in the in the United States
anymore.
So I just want to make sure that
of the taxpayers of the state or
not being put on the hook for
this the second problem is.
If I'm reading but what you have
before us right here with Senate
bill three oh one.
The answer settlement of are we
trying to create a new name for
the horses by calling in the
free roaming horses.
Because they are still an
equine.
Is it is still.
Under the livestock code here we
know that most of these horses.
Income from a domestic air
domesticated surroundings.
And so I my concern there is why
are we trying to change what we
are now calling the points
because I think that that is
what the next step the next bill
is going to do is put a
definition on it we probably
should have for these in reverse
order.
So I'm curious is that what
we're trying to do is relate
these feral horses.
Madam chair representative so
this is the conditions is here.
So on page seven one twenty one
fortify the Fremont home free
from our allies and friends
boards found at large that is
not industry.
And it does not include those
eight points are subject to the
jurisdiction of the federal
government as you know the deal
and because we don't want to
get into the jurisdiction of the
BLM and how they have to carry
out the world the roaming horses
and burros ash nineteen seventy
one okay so free roaming our
mains.
Clan wars found a large
settlement here Senator
Representative I guess you are
aware of the brand kids and
stayed in New Mexico are Katelin
missing of director garland
would like to lay on on make
sure that I'm right on this we
are required by law to brand our
cat we are not required to
spread our is that correct if
director that's exactly right
of.
So.
For the last four to be able to
try to place these forces that
for their originally came from
zoom almost deaf impossible to
date if there's no brand visible
brand on these forces a lot of
courses of.
There is a yes to to that upper
