amazing relationships with past
presidents members of the
council the current council
members and I can tell you not
one time if we ever got into an
argument over politics or or
anything we just been able to
work well together come up with
solutions.
They've invited me to every
single inauguration that they've
had and I'm I'm just completely
blessed and feel really blessed
being able to expose my children
to their culture and have that
experience for them and and it's
meant a lot to me to have this
opportunity and I look forward
to even though they're not gonna
be my district coming up next

were taken from here.
After they were imprisoned then

someone given the opportunity to
move other places with.
Of.
Not necessarily come to the
beautiful land of.

Ask you here sampling user if
you could take you are invited
me Madam.
All right.
Members of the committee and
madam chair are you able to hear
me.
Yes.
All right right.
Good morning members of the
committee and madam chair my
name is mark Chino the former.
President of the Mescalero
Apache tribe and I appreciate
the opportunity to share some
thoughts with you this morning I
know your time is limited so I
will be as brief as possible.
Madam chair members of the
committee I have a little bit of
a different take on.
The situation regarding Senate
memorial forty six.
Simply stated.
Whatever differences.
The Mescalero Apache tribe.
And the.
Fort sill Apache tribe.
Have.
Has no bearing on the fate of
Senate memorial forty six.
Madam chair and members of the
committee those differences can
be worked out.
In a different arena at a
different time.
The purpose of this hearing is
to.
Celebrate hopefully.
The passage of Senate memorial
forty six which celebrates.
The existence of the Mescalero
Apache reservation for the past
a hundred and fifty years.
During my time as president of
the tribe.
I learned very quickly.
That unfortunately there's two
things that tend to influence
what happens in Indian country
and probably elsewhere in those
two things I've come to call
politics and personalities.
Madam chair members of the
committee I urge you today.
Don't let politics and
personalities.
File your judgment or influence
your thinking with respect to
Senate memorial forty six.
As I stated whatever differences
the two tribes may have is for a
different time and a different
arena hopefully those can be
settled.
But the fate.
Of Senate memorial forty six.
Has nothing to do.
With those differences.
The purpose of Senate memorial
forty six is to celebrate as I
stated.
The existence.
The influence.
The partition participation.
And the contribution.
Of a hundred and fifty years of
the Mescalero Apache tribe of
the Mescalero Apache people.
Not only to the state of New
Mexico but to the entire United
States and indeed the influence
of the Mescalero Apache tribe
has extended outside the
boundaries of the United States.
And so I would ask you once
again.
Don't let those two things
politics and personalities.
Influence your thinking and your
judgment when it comes to the
future of Senate memorial forty
six.
This memorial is.
Worthy of your favorable
consideration.
And it comes at a time.
When there's so much division
and political difference not
just here in New Mexico but
across the nation.
That we need to come together in
unity.
As citizens of New Mexico as
members of the Mescalero Apache
tribe as members of the Fort
Sill Apache tribe as members of
the other tribes and nations and
pueblos in New Mexico.
And this memorial will promote
those good relations.
For many many years to come.
So madam chair and members of
the committee I would urge you.
Passed Senate memorial forty six
out of this committee with a do
pass recommendation.
The full New Mexico house of
representatives.
And the New Mexico Senate.
Madam chair members of the
committee thank you for your
attention once again I
appreciate the opportunity to
speak with you this morning
thank you very much.
Now what are the advantages are
one of the chat just to support
their use by the US to near
thank you.
Questions.
I'm sure Mr surely support to
more only the muscular patchy
tribe is been great neighbors to
the city of our.
and surrounding areas and.
You step back and I'm I moved to
Alamogordo nineteen fifty four
you guys a little.
But.
The local.
the.
The relationship is special to
me and
we've all for years.
Share a lot of the same goals
and we try to try to work the
things of that are positive for
our part of the world
you look at founders park
Alamogordo for research which
recognizes a lot of the the
individuals who have had
an impact on.
For for the world and with Chino
was one of them when the channel
is representative of us at
founders park to represent not
gestures here with him to call.
But director Representative the
competition trough.
And
You know it's really it's it's
need to see their vision report
was brought there's and I'm I'm
on a mission support.
Thank you any other questions
Senator Ivey Soto thank you
madam chair and and you know
first of all I.
I don't know why it is that
Senator Pirtle and bring such
controversial memorial.
Because all I'm hearing is that
people just want to celebrate
something.
And.
And I think that's ultimately
from the bottom line on this
memorial is is is is.
I recognize that there's that
there are conversations to be
had about.
About Fort Sill about about.
Ugh different groups chair
palace for about.
About
Landed a terror county Linda
Luna County.
But I don't see it as a in this
memorial.
That.
That does that discussion.
And and I don't see anything in
this memorial.
That that
Takes away anything from from
any other group of Apaches that
that may have up a conversation
about something that would like
to to have I was.
Please to hear
So the representatives from the
from the Fort Sill.
tried to get up and.
While establishing their claims
also state that they support
this.
More this is a memorial about.
About what's happening okay
okay.
It is a memorial about what's
happened.
over the last.
We figured out is a hundred
forty and a half years.
And if the hundred fifty madam
chair Senator if we could amend
it is a hundred and fifty so
mistranslations say may twenty
ninth eighteen seventy.
Okay.
Well let me just let me just
real quick make that make that a
motion as an amendment so we
have a motion to amend like
fifteen may twenty seventh
eighteen eighty three to may
twenty seventh the twenty
thirteen twenty nine yes
eighteen seventy three at the
twenty seven.
Right now we need to change the
seven to nine seven two.
Yeah and trace the eighty three
to seventy three.
And is that if we get it right
yes yes okay okay.
If.
All the yes I
do we have any opposition given
the.
The.
That was that the only change
with me that's get a lesson
which is going to make it and
and and that's what happens when
you get a white cat carrier for
more than forty five.
You know is
You know but this is this is
There was at some point in may
of one year in the two hundred
thousand second order by
president grant and and what's
established.
This reservation and and you
know the reservation system is.
That we have in this country is
is a is a is a system that is
part of an overall process of of
of of cultural.
Genocide that the that the hard
part countries engaged in and
yet.
the Mescalero people the Apache
people who have.
Who have been on this
reservation have done incredible
things and and the fact that we
have three bands.
It one tribe there in Mescalero.
Is is I think also something
that shows.
a traditional hospitality.
Shows the the
The effects of war.
And what happens with the
diaspora.
and and when people get removed
from.
From their homeland and and
then.
And then have it assigned a
place if they want to quote
unquote return whether that is
whether actually from or not.
and and the the last hundred
fifty years.
you know the the the Mescaleros
in southern Damascus Mexico have
when I think it's very to where
it says on page two of them at
the forefront of the fight for
tribal sovereignty.
they have been you know that
they've been.
you know in all the discussions
Senator Griggs was caring
of Bill earlier this year.
which which died and then came
back and.
And then got prioritized.
What not dealing with the forest
fires and and and and every
discussed unforced errors.
We're there is not only
conversation but the fact that
the federal government doesn't
know how to manage.
The forests.
But the federal government would
do well to learn from Mexico.
because because the Mescaleros
have.
Have have care for the forest
under their under their domain
and.
and and have a.
kept it healthy in a way that
that other areas have not.
And you know the the
What's what's happened with the
you know with the
into the mountain guns.
with the with the various
different programs.
That the must love actually
tried as John that are there the
big game hunting program.
and and you know one of the.
For me.
Something I really enjoyed one
point was the this is a long is
the second longest zip line
there the third longest and
once.
K. expand right.
The.
It is all wrong okay yeah
capital.
But.
You know the third longest zip
line that goes and you know
which goes over the forest.
Which is an amazing view to
have.
I wish I had a video.
Of what I went down it although
you wouldn't be able to use the
audio.
But but but it's really is
expressions of amazement but
anyways you know and then and
and and and the.
And frankly the fireworks
display it on my my daughter
lives with me here and we went
to the pharmacist a one year.
And we've been earlier that year
we've been in New Zealand.
And we saw the fireworks display
it at the Mescalero Apache
reservation in and for the
fourth of July.
And Bob this is got nothing on
you guys.
You know
the way described it was well
you know the family.
It's twenty seven minutes of the
family.
The entire time.
And so you know I mean it's up
it's up it's a celebration
because because of of of of of
the sense of identity which
would really hurt from today
from people the sense of
identity the sense of history.
The sense of belonging.
And and that is something I
think we need to be able to
celebrate.
I recognize are the discussions
that that need to happen.
But they don't need to happen at
the expense of a celebration
what is taking place for the
last hundred years the.
And the and so and so I
Hi I will gladly support this
and I would hope that everybody
would be able to take this
opportunity to focus on the
celebration.
Thank you.
Thank you members of the
location and.
For voting on the amendment.
Okay Senator X. yes.
There is a yes.
Sanchez yes.
Senator yes.
The service yes.
If the amendment passes those
and memorial forty six wants to
know if.
The other questions from
committee members.
So thank you for the discussion
today and I up knowing.
Comments that were made that
issue I don't think the memorial
does the justice to the legacy
of the native American tribes
and getting to this point we
don't mention those leaders in
the past so I felt it was a but
that Mescaleros Memorial wanted
to keep it short and sweet in
that sense of what we do know
that that history to is the
perception of those who sought
in in there and from there ice
facilities here for
Great historian Senator share.
and in that sense so as we move
forward Mr came up yes I the
historic preservation officer
thank you for your contributions
to the memorial and all those
who make public comment you know
those legacies are there of the
You know those opportunities to
have incorporated into.
C. l'oreal's is that this could
be the.
That that's where we are right
now with this particular
memorial and
I think that I didn't give my
suggestions to to the best
clothes on what about the
direction of despite the depth
of the memorial garden but I
know they've extended their
invitation out to all those
tried and when there's a date
set for this particular
celebration that there will be
that piece to really stand up
positive side of all those
accomplishments for all tribes
nations and pueblos.
I think so though in a lot of
comments were made on a lot of
those
Aspects that the Mescalero put
forth to celebrate and
investments to thank you senator
grace about the COVID during
this time to bring things
together for people all the
people.
So looking forward to
spending more time with our
other brothers and sisters from
around not just the state of New
Mexico will hopefully from the
nation celebrate this moment
the chair will entertain.
The New Mexico the committee.
With the president the past
insanity Senator second Senator
great little of the please.
The closing comments in a
conventional keep it extremely
brief but I I appreciate all the
tribal council members coming
today I appreciate everybody
taking the time and I will say
you know the the memorial speaks
to the mountains and the trees
and all of those things but the
most beautiful and the most
precious thing to me about
Mescalero is its people and I
think that will continue to be
the legacy and I'm just super
proud that they came here today
and we're given the opportunity
before this committee to to tell
their story thank you thank you
thank you Senator Pirtle please

Okay the human donor House Bill.
Great thank you madam chair good
morning committee member's house
bill one ninety eight
As a as a body we have
responsibility to ensure that
the American students have equal
access to programs and services
necessary to make college or
career ready for the fast for
the for the past four years an
average of three point nine
million dollars annually has
been allocated to eighty seven
local education agencies for
career technical education
programs under their career
education technical education
statute however the statute does
not allow for other schools in
New Mexico funded by the bureau
of Indian education to apply for
these funding and or to be
provided programs for their
native American students house
bill one ninety eight will make
technical corrections to the
career technical education pilot
project statute the CTE funds
statute also known as the next
generation CTE project so that
nine secondary schools in New
Mexico funded by the bureau of
Indian education are eligible
would be eligible to apply and
to participate in this project
and for this funding is a face
an inconsistency between our
state law and the federal Carl
D. Perkins career and technical
education act of two thousand
six that act provided this
funding the the the federal plan
that comes to our state that
instructs New Mexico in other
states if need be I II funded
schools of bureau in education
funded schools as local
education agencies representing
the federal technical education
funding allocations and so with
that Madam chairwoman
Representative questions is it
up to the committee and I would
I mean I have I have a former
governor of Alvin ward with me
from Santa Clara pueblo as well
as former governor we just
because we go to follow with me
does that I don't know okay
thank you and go out to the
audience those in the opposition
to the bill.
We have anybody in support of
the bill.
Okay if you would like to get
public comment will start on the
side of the state.
Good morning madam chairman and
members of the committee my name
is doing up the I am the
act try my stand in support of
this building that our our
school the reservation is a B.
I. useful and so eight have a
supplemental funding that we can
get better enhanced learning
experience of our students you
know we will all support that
you know we have issues impact
aid our school is here part of
the total school districts which
receive on an annual basis of
profit one point two billion
dollars but we don't see that
coming back to the B. I. E.
school on the reservation just
our students that goes collegial
rose said you all what we're
seeing is the our families on
state together combined funding
for both of these ons could be
what is approximately forty
thousand dollars and basically
alone thank you forty so
anything that we can do to
supplement funding with.
The password the experience of
our children to give them that
much are we supports for thank
you.
Have public comment.
Madam chairman chairwoman
numbers any more programs
Representative the Santa Fe
Indian school I like to think
the Sanchez been so long so use
is for real.
Chairman members of the
committee this is really
a next tier of outcomes and
things that need to be
addressed.
Yazzie Martinez lawsuit there's
no reason why it Merican Stooges
of only five yards
from of funding should not be
subject to be received by like
this and so with this
legislation we would be able to
receive funding and in a very
important area which is career
technical of patient has how
many of those career technical
programs that we have speaking
that.
Chair along with the next tier
of the state's fast dealing with
smaller cracks it will in the
Martinez are organizations like
Los Alamos National Health.
Have the secretary of more and
now represents and the fact that
organizations like that are
reading forward resources like
in and his office to work on
these kind of issues of the
Santa Fe Indian school has
twenty three pounds students for
twenty three counties that
attend the school so this is a
statewide.
This is a very important program
and we feel we deserve to see
these folks thank you madam.
Madam chair members of the
committee of over also look at
Representative novel but for
school.
Working with
sponsored sworn in the so these
numbers on the school's security
getting we
Representative as of the school
census.
Funds are.
Or of this bill also.
The.
Good morning madam chair members
of.
Public soupy and we do have the
ID school is well and then the
funding that was.
So.
Appreciate it thank.
The state that the genocide.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee my name is mark
Mitchell former governor of Cebu
for your service chairman awful
council members.
Thanks for this bill are in the.
For favorable office.
Madam chair Comercio and I and
the rest of this proposal so
after Thompson's time.
Of this legislation
that the house is attending the
Santa Fe Indian school and they
were previous benefit from.
Having career technical
education funding by expand our.
Of early on there is some
concern raised about the funding
of that is.
CTE funding.
The chances.
There's more research project
managers that.
Is also to health committee.
Good times.
So thank you very much.
The majority of members of the
committee my name is Gail we
heal the sector sure in order
tables Council also former
governor of city Fogel and
chairman of the APC G. H. K. and
then again we stand in support
of this.
Staff thank you.
Thank you madam chair and
committee members my name's also
react with the ACLU Mexico we
sent a strong ninety eight
because it allows tribes to
build the necessary from across
the the have self sustaining
economies and because this is
really is a good to allow tribes
to compete alongside the rest of
the state where was kind of an
oversight to begin with where
they had been left out of the
process of resentful support
passing everybody and sponsored
program.
I think that anybody unless
there is to do the job then.
Good morning madam chair and
members of the committee my name
is Mike de Rio from the Landel
foundation we strongly support
HB one ninety eight and we think
Representative twenty and those
who developed this very
important bill well foundation
believes that all native
American students should have
equal access to programs and
services necessary so they can
be college or career ready this
cannot happen if the line BID
funded high schools continue to
be denied access to the career
technical education pilot
project in CTE funds statute.
Schools like I said by just
partially community schools hi
health schools and Navajo prep
are striving to offer multiple
CTE programs to their students
but have to use their operating
dollars or apply for foundation
grants to do this they should
not be the case as
Representative Eli date
mentioned the federal Carl D.
Perkins career and technical
education act two thousand six
requires that New Mexico and
other states treat BID funded
secondary schools as local
educational agencies for the
purpose of our season receiving
federal CTE funding allocated to
states the next Gen CTE statute
should be consistent with
federal law it should also
reflect New Mexico law and
practice which already allows B.
are you funded schools to get
state capital outlay and general
obligation bond funding and
funding the different state
agencies madam chair isn't and
that members of the committee
were urge that you adopted to
pass for H. B. one ninety eight
thank you.
I have to go.
good morning madam chair and
members of the committee my name
is Gerry Lujan governor of
health problems most recently I
was an employee of the Santa Fe
Indian school A. B. I. E. funded
school but tribally controlled
to stand in support of H. B. one
ninety eight for several reasons
first we believe the human
secondary schools are eligible
to receive state funds
specifically CTE funding in the
past tribal schools like the
Santa Fe Indian school received
capital outlay and funding
through general obligation bonds
or this method is it is a
pathway to
Or as part of the school's
secondly New Mexico receives
funding for CTE programs from
the federal government that the
strengthening CTE for twenty
first century act commonly known
as the Perkins act is the
federal law that establishes
funding for CDC and its awarded
by the federal government the
states like New Mexico in FY
twenty three the state received
ten point one million point
Perkins award.
Lastly in their academic last
times native American students
living on tribal lands may end
up attending both BID and state
supported public schools at
various points and their
schooling we know that
educational outcomes for native
students have been consistently
now well they need all the
opportunities that are available
to all students including access
to care technical education we
ask that you strongly support H.
B. one ninety eight thank you
madam chair and members of the
committee.
It
the next.
Senator Ivey Soto thank you
madam chair I you know I think
it's.
It is that the I. schools.
Are fully funded by the federal
government proverbs and
But these are students in New
Mexico.
And so you know I mean we we
have
we have an obligation to
resistance of New Mexico but we
also.
Of particular is being protected
legislation.
Up this is the these are funds
that go to economic development
thank you know to.
Hopefully kids saying a future
for themselves in this area.
And and hopefully also within
their their tribal communities.
And the and so you know I I
representative Lente and and
also the your co sponsoring this
luncheon Representative tells.
you know I think that this is
not thank you for bringing this.
It does occur to me that
With the public project those
low income right it is this yeah
madam chair you know it does it
does occur to me that that we
may want to at some point.
and education code so that so
that we I school of schools are
just straight up eligible for
any below the line funding.
to compete for that.
And
Because those are all those are
all competitive optional
programs.
And again these are these are
students of New Mexico.
So thank you very much.
Thank you any other questions
committee representation the
thank you madam chair of.
No no no questions no thank the
the sponsor and New Mexico
Sanchez Representative Johnson
is here of which is trying to
make sure that all the resources
that are are are given you know
to the state will be available
from the state go to all those
the students and and the schools
at no or serving our students so
thank you all for work and all
the building trying to.
You know I solutions to our or
or or or or issues that we have
with our children you just want
to make sure that we have equal
opportunity.
About gross is sold on the other
side you know of presenting a
bill that we passed around you
know I R. V. sizzle projects
and.
With the quick equity that we
were trying to set up you know
for a solar project Sandoval
County that's and he was about
school district we passed all
two years ago.
Under the old law school got
thirty eight thousand from that
project on a yearly basis since
we passed a law to make it
equitable for all schools in the
county the agency values only
seven thousand something in
Albuquerque.
Hi the school district approved
as the smallest but presented in
a in Santa Fe County gets the
same amount so we so that's a
lie for twenty five years so we
just cost him as well as school
districts over half a million
dollars or life of this project.
And that's a school that has the
most native and Hispanic kids
ninety ninety two percent of its
native Americans Hispanic kids.
And they have no other of.
No no property taxes lot of of
military National Forest.
So you know we have to be going
on these these are kinds of
things that that we do
and so in that bill trying to
fix that to make sure that the
majority of those no funds that
are within the school district
go to that school district not
everybody else so I just want
sure that simple that's were I
was at a sorry.
Because a lot of the rural
school districts are now seeing
that.
and so the past ninety zero the
Senate finance.
But thank you with those guys.
Senator thank you madam chair
thank you all of the.
I've lease here today they have
this is our.
Got a high school.
Anyway I'm just curious where
does Israel.
Those that madam chair
representative process and
education okay former stop it
and hopefully to the floor okay
all right thank you and thank
you thank you for the next.
Who was the best a couple of so
this project to the seven year
project on the BID schools how
are the let's say you get some
funding the project goes away
the what what what do you think
the plan will be to continue
this
if it keeps going I mean I'm
would ask a federal funding or
What if people and the other is
what it the dust schools still
have the capacity for this
application process.
What Graham provided the
committee the sheeting and
putting this out I mean we know
we already have the capacity at
a for them to come into the but
to actually have to be any
school come in.
Applaud.
And maintain it
is there any plan on that I
think some are more established
than others but it's
To have this discussion yet.
Madam chair and and and centers
like it have of the store
address that for us the happy to
chair members of the committee
thank you for those questions I
think it's very thoughtful
because you're thinking head
what is what is going to
actually be for the schools how
does this get implement such
your first question if you're
correct this is a pilot project
there's three more years for
this project
I believe the way that the law
was originally structured
there's going to be an
opportunity to assess the data
associated with the pilot
project my sense from the
conversations that that I've had
is that there's pretty
resounding support for CTE in
across both sides of the aisle.
There's a significant amount of
demand from schools for these
types of programs because it's
one of the best ways to keep
students engaged and also to
prepare students for careers so
I would definitely not
anticipate for try to predict
what this body will do when this
pilot project expires but I can
say from the members of the
public from school districts and
now B. I. funded schools there's
gonna be a lot of interest in
encouraging this body to
continue to make this an
ongoing.
The second thing that's
encouraging is in the version of
house bill two that came over
from the house it contains forty
million dollars for C. T. work
based learning and for something
called the New Mexico
innovations on initiatives why
that's relevant is that the
funding for this next Gen CTE is
part of that forty million but
it also represents a bigger
emphasis by the head on these
kinds of programs that will go
on that includes that action CTE
pilot program but it goes far
beyond so I guess what I'm
saying is we have good reason to
think that this isn't just going
to and in three years when the
pilot project and to your second
question I think that's actually
a great question and what I can
say a I'm here primarily of us
working for the letter
foundation but I'm also on the
board of trustees for the Santa
Fe Indian school the Santa Fe
Indian school has been working
very closely with Navajo prep
and with the other seven BA Fund
in high schools as part of this
bill I think we have an exciting
opportunity because some of the
schools as you mentioned a
little bit more capacity or may
have a little bit more
experience with applying for and
managing state funds there's an
opportunity for those schools to
share knowledge and experience
to also tap into organizations
like the Landel foundation and
others that are positioned to
help the schools to apply for
these funds and to help them
implement these programs so
short answers I think there's a
way to share knowledge from the
schools that have already
successfully applied for other
state funded programs and a way
to tap into external resources
thank you mentioned thank you
and do we actually know if any
of these B. I. schools already
have some creative.
The program already implemented
even though they're not receive
funds from us.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee yes in fact
sentiment school has eight
different areas that are are
currently being implemented all
using operational dollars or
poor or requests the other
schools to certain degrees have
maybe a single CTE courses or
have more than that.
Right so there's I guess a base
to build this whatever.
Thank you and any other
questions for committee members
we have a motion by Senator
Shendo for the past six.
Yes Senator Ivey Soto yes Sir
Representative is yes.
