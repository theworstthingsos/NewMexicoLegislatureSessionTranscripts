Representative Thompson.
Madam Vice Chair here, Madam
Chair.
Present here.
We have corum.
OK. We, um, have corn and we
will start with House Bill 76
and just if anyone is here for
House Bill 247, there was, um.
An amendment, I believe, to the
bill that came in late, so it
will be rolled, um, House Bill
247, the healthcare
practitioner, transparency bill
will be rolled to be heard
Thursday, February 20th, just in
case anyone is here for that
bill.
Um, OK, so, um, Representative
Thompson, House Bill 76.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
thank you for for hearing this
bill again. Um,
The the substitute.
Substantially changed things, so
one of the, one of the issues
was having, um, was what was in
the, the title, and that has
been changed.
So it's creating additional
congenital heart disease
screening requirements, as
opposed to tests.
And then, um, on page 3.
Sure. Can I, can we move the
committee?
Thank you. Uh, it's been moved
for discussion.
Committee substitute.
So then on page 3,
It
There was some confusion over
what was, what was a must and
what was a can, so we, we
changed it to by means of
further evaluation, OK, um.
If
Um, it is necessary.
Based on a screening that uses a
standard questionnaire developed
by the department.
To to
To evaluate whether a newborn
had an abnormal fetal ultrasound
or has any diagnosed systemic or
genetic disorders associated
with heart disease, and then
there's the list of the
questions. So what it is now is
um.
Basically
Having the questions be part of
the must, but, but not what the
actions would be after that.
Is there any discussion on the
amendment? Oh.
You, Madam Chair. Hold on one
second, because it's early and
we have
A substitute.
So I'm sure, I need to ask some
questions because after this
bill was heard last time, I got
a lot of emails and phone calls
from medical professionals.
So if I understand correctly
with this amendment on page 3.
So right now they do the pulse
oximeter.
Correct.
And then Matam chair and
representative.
Then we're going into saying,
OK, you do the pulse oximeter
and by means of further
evaluation of a healthcare
provider determines further
evaluation is necessary.
Based it on a screening that
uses the standard questions. We
go through and we have those
questions before general heart
disease and cardiac death.
So infant, etc. etc. so.
We do this and
We do the pulse oximeter and
then we're required to ask
certain questions, Madam Chair.
And then based on those
questions.
Then it would trigger.
