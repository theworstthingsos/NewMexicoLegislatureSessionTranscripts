Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Um, if

heads.
And join me and I volunteer
prayer by William Barkley.
Oh God, our Father.
Deliver us this day from all
that would keep us from serving
you.
And from serving our fellow
human beings as we ought.
Deliver us from all coldness of
heart.
And grant that neither our hand
nor our heart may ever remain
shut to the appeal of someone's
need.
Deliver us from all weakness of
will.
From the indecision which which
cannot make up its mind.
From the realization that cannot
abide by a decision once it is
made.
From the ability to say no to
the tempting voices which come
to us from inside and from
outside.
Deliver us from all failure and
endeavor.
For being too easily
discouraged.
For giving up and giving in too
soon.
From allowing any task to defeat
us because it is too difficult.
Grant and and to us today the
love which is generous and help.
The determination which is
steadfast in decision. The
perseverance, which is enduring
unto the end.
Through Jesus Christ our Lord,
amen.

Gentlemen from Donana.
Mr. Speaker, I move that we go
to that next order of business
announcement in miscellaneous
miscellaneous business
objection. It is so ordered.
Gentle lady from Santa Fe,
Sandoval and Los Alamos,
Representative Chandler, with an
announcement. Uh, thank you, Mr.
Speaker. I just wanted to update
people on what we're doing in
House Judiciary, so we will be
meeting in our usual time and
with our usual agenda type
tomorrow, Wednesday afternoon
after the floor session.
After that, we will be meeting
at the call of the chair in case
there are certain bills that we
need to pull up. So that could
be on a Thursday, that could be
on Friday, but I just wanted to
alert people as to how I am
planning to proceed, Mr.
Speaker. Thank you very much.
The gentleman from Chavez,
Representative Murphy, thank you
Mr. Speaker, uh, hopefully
everybody has received a gift
bag from Roswell and Travis
County. It's the bags were
provided by Eastern New Mexico
Medical Center, um, find
hospitals down there.
Also want to thank our friends
over at Fat Man's Beef Jerky
and, uh, Rossville Chamber of
Commerce and Apex Farms that you
looked at me when you announced
the beef jerky. I saw that.
It's uh
It's empty.
That's how good it is. It's so
good. I've already eaten it.
I've got a few pieces here left
for you though, Mr. Speaker, if
you need some more. Did you say
bad man or Fat man? Batman.
Fat man with an F, Batman's FT
fat man's look at me when you
say that every time, man. I it
kind of has a ring to it, um,
Mr. Speaker, um, at any rate,
The, uh, you also have a
flashlight in case we uh we lose
electricity and need to find
your way out of the chamber and,
uh, and some good pins. So, uh,
any rate, the, uh, good folks of
Chavis County, Rossville Chamber
of Commerce, Economic
Development, people put that
together and I hope everybody
enjoys it. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Thank you gentlemen,
for all the vegetarians in the
chamber, bring your beef jerky
to office 102.
Gentlemen from Otero with his
beef jerky donation. Speaker,
it's already gone for me. I, I
can't donate it. The fat man is
probably sitting right here from
the fifty-First district.
In fact is an interesting term.
But Mr. Speaker, I did have a
point of personal privilege.
State your point. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. So actually, a few
minutes ago, myself and the good
representative from Bern Leo and
Torrance. We were down near the
rotunda and we were being
Event that turned into a protest
which is against the rules of
this capital. So Mr. Speaker,
they were yelling, sirs, they
were yelling things that I'm not
going to repeat. They were
following us. We had to actually
get the state police involved
and so Mr. Speaker, I just
wanted to bring attention to
the, these individuals who were
attacking people like myself and
Representative Lord who may have
Jewish heritage. My myself, it's
a Sephardic Jewish heritage and
so I find it to be extremely
Not cool when these people come
here to our capital, talk about
one issue and then turn it into
a protest and attack people who
they disagree with on an issue,
especially in this capital,
people who are elected. So I
just uh wanted to bring the
body's attention to that and
hopefully these individuals are
out of this building because
they were being very violent and
uh following, intimidating,
yelling slurs, threats, which is
not OK.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you gentlemen, and I agree
there's no room for threats.
There is no room for violence.
There's no room for verbal
violence, um, in any of these
activities that happen in our
capital, um, I was not aware of
that, um, and I'm very sorry
that that happened. Uh, no one
should be subjected, no matter
what the issue is, no matter
what the political environment
might be nationally, um, there's
no room for that, so, um, thank
you for highlighting that.
And I'm sorry that that happened
to you.
Any other announcements. Get a
lady from Berlin and Tours.
Yes, Mr. Speaker, a point of
personal privilege to expand on
that.
Thank you. So Mr. Speaker, it is
not OK, uh look, I started as a
political activist, everybody
knows I had one of the largest
2nd Amendment rallies and not a
single person was violent. I was
very carefully to instill in
people that when you come to
advocate anything you should
never be violent. You should
never send violent emails. You
should make violent phone calls.
She never make threats ever.
I just walked down into a
protest that was not a protest.
These were people who earlier
today had signs saying.
Not nice things about certain
people. And when we walked into
the middle of that, Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Speaker, we had 3 gentlemen
follow us. One was threatening
to kill me.
This is not OK.
I believe I don't know if
Represent Block has the video we
had it early. We know the
gentleman said it. He said, I'm
going to kill you.
Were his words then he called me
a Nazi.
And as a Jew, this is so
unacceptable. I cannot believe
that we have got a makeshift
bomb downstairs. We've got
people making threats we have
violence and the most disgusting
thing is when I have people who
are wearing actual terrorist
outfits.
It's terrorizing for a person of
me who's of Jewish descent.
This was so uncalled for. I
can't even begin to tell you how
infuriating and how insulting
and how demeaning this is to
anyone.
Who has any Jewish blood in
them, and there's quite a few in
New Mexico, Mr. Speaker.
And Mr. Speaker, it's not OK to
be followed because if we didn't
have state police up there and
we didn't have our amazing
security who is right in the
middle of that.
I can tell you right now, there
was a girl that tried to lay her
hands on me when I was in the
middle of that group and tried
to detain me and stop me.
And luckily I had our amazing
security team and our wonderful
state police that were there to
get in the middle of that, but
to call to start calling people
names.
And to intimidate them and to
harass them and to make threats
of death.
It is not OK in this roundhouse,
Mr. Speaker, not now, not ever,
and I completely admonish what
happened today should never
should have happened.
And the people are coming to
protest to make a point, but to
make threats of violence and to
call people names and insult
them and harass them is
definitely not OK on any level
in this roundhouse, Mr. Speaker.
The lady and I agree and I think
that this is a lesson for us
here in this chamber to always
take the higher road and not to
fall for the provocations that
others may, may, may push us to
whether that's uh in public
square, whether it's in social
on social media, whether it's on
Twitter, whether it's on X or on
Instagram or wherever it is that
you might hold your own
political pages. The fact of the
matter is that it is a very
volatile political environment,
trust me, I know there is a case
that is.
today.
Because my home was shot at and
I was targeted.
OK, so.
I feel and understand.
Your frustration and I will
repeat.
We in this body hold ourselves
to a higher standard. I don't
control what people out there
do.
But I can sure as heck,
encourage us in this body.
Uh, to
To that higher standard, and I
believe that to a great degree
we do well in holding ourselves
to that higher standard, so
again, I don't know what
happened outside or up upstairs.
I am sorry that some of you
encountered what you did.
It has no place in this
building. I'm grateful for.
Our security personnel.
For keeping the peace, uh, for
ensuring that the rights.
Of the protesters are protected.
While also keeping them.
Other people, staff, and us
safe.
Any other announcements before
we go to 3rd reading, young lady
from Bern Leo.

ask is the stormlight archive by
Brandon Sanderson. He's
interested in law, politics,
economics, wealth inequality,
and I'm hoping.
that he will replace me in a
decade or so because he's a
fabulously curious about the
world around him, he's asked
great questions sitting here for
two hours with the floor session
to start. Please welcome Micah.
Welcome to the house.

you do, um, crisis intervention

lady from South of it.
Mr. Speaker, I move we go to
that order of business
announcements and miscellaneous
business.
Gentle lady from Santa Fe.
Mr. Speaker, it now being 11:59
a.m., I move that we adjourn
until 12:01 p.m.
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous
consent that the rules be
suspended and that the journal
show all those present in this
morning's session are present in
this afternoon session.
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous
consent that the rules be
suspended and that the records
show that the journal has been
read in full and approved,
subject to revision and approval
of the rules and order of
Business Committee.
See an objection. It is so
ordered.
Any other announcements if we go
before we go to 3rd reading.
Right, gentle lady from center
of it.
Mr. Speaker, I move we go to
that order of business. 3rd
reading of legislation.
It is so ordered.
Gentle lady from Santa Fe, are
you ready?
On item number 46. Yes, Mr.
Speaker, would you get me to
that point?
action necessary for placing
sent about 57 on final passage
has been taken and it is not
subject to debate amendment or
substitution generally to
explain the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Uh,
Senate Bill 57 addresses, uh,
protecting, uh, medical records
and records of medical providers
that are employed by public
bodies, um, it still allows
folks plenty of information
regarding medical services and
other, uh, information that they
need about health care services
provided at public bodies,
however, we are protecting
medical providers.
sensitive information, uh, as
well as personal identifying
information in this legislation,
um, to ensure basically their
safety, uh, Mr. Speaker, and
body, uh, the reason that this
legislation has been brought
forward is because these medical
providers have faced um some
serious uh threats as well as
concerns around public safety or
safety of themselves and their
families and so the the reason
for bringing this bill forward
is to ensure that these
healthcare.
providers can continue to
provide services, um, at, uh,
whether they're employed at a
local public body or uh uh uh uh
employed at a government agency
while still maintaining their
ability to feel safe and secure,
uh, in their homes in their
workplaces when they are
traveling, um, and Mr. Speaker,
uh, body the the threats uh are
concerning, and I think we
should all take them seriously,
um, there's been a lot of
discussion about.
Making sure that we all feel
safe as we do our work and this
is just another example of that,
uh, and with that I would stand
for debate.
There is a bit generally from
Chavez, Curry, Roosevelt,
Representative Ree. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker, where the gentle
lady from?
Santa Fe yield.
Uh, I yield to the gentle lady
from Curry, my neighbor and
Judiciary.
Thank you, um, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, um, I just wanna
talk about the bill a little bit
because I know that um.
Why I know in judiciary talked a
little bit.
Uh, about the spill, so Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, this
does not apply, is my
understanding to um IPRA for
patients, um, that is covered
under, uh, HIPAA, is that
correct, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
that's correct. All right, and
so this bill, Mr. Speaker Jelai
is looking to provide, um, IPAA
protection for um who
specifically?
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
this really uh only applies to
the practice of a medical
provider employed by a public
body.
OK, that was gonna be my next
question, Mr. Speaker and gentle
ladies, so this is for public
bodies and not private entities.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, yes,
because the inspection of public
Records Act would not apply to a
private entity.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle ladies. So I wanna talk a
little bit about the problems
and I know we talked about them
in committee a little bit, but
so the body understands what,
what are the problems that
medical providers or or people
who are um receiving these
IPRAs, um, in reference to
medical providers, what is the
issue in the state that that
you're trying to address, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, uh,
we're trying to address that
these providers may um uh be
subject to threats or um uh
discomfort, um, when they are,
for example, showing up for
their shift at work, um,
engaging in travel plans when
they are working with students,
um, and Mr. Speaker Speaker
Genlii, I should introduce my uh
expert witness who is Doctor Eve
EB who's head of.
Obstetrics and gynecology at
UNM, um, but Mr. Speaker, uh,
gentle lady in conversations
with her, um, they also
supervise a lot of students.
There's a lot of educational,
uh, pieces to the medical
practice, um, and so there's a
lot of back and forth, um, over
email, uh, around scheduling of
students, students traveling,
students, uh, supervision and
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, all of
those things, um, just bring a
heightened, uh.
sense of wanting to have that
sense of security around uh
these uh specific medical
providers.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and
gentle lady, could you?
Provide some examples for the
body and you kind of talked
about travel plans and um
schedules and things of that
nature and emails, but
specifically like could you give
me an example, Mr. Speaker, of
like a, a threat or something
that's happened that that you
could use as an example so we
Um, Mr. Speaker and gentle
ladies, so an example would be,
um, a student emailing uh the
head of the OBGYN department and
then being targeted on social
media or being targeted by
picketing at their home.
And Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
you're saying the a student um
is emailing a professor or some
type of um.
Medical practitioner and then
the that person that the
provider, the, the medical
practitioner or a person that
was emailed is being picketed at
their home.
Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, both the supervising
physician as well as keep in
mind these are not undergraduate
students. These are residents or
other clinical staff, so, um,
that are continuing their
education, um, so yes, so on
both sides there is a concern
around um both uh their their
personal their private homes as
well as on social media as well.
And Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
um, so I see, I mean this is we
are talking about public
entities versus private entities
which I, I believe you know in
some sense we have people who
are choosing to.
Perform services there or um
it's not a a private setting so
yes uh the subject to IPRA, I
see why we want this
transparency, but when you're
talking about picketing, has it
gone any further than an
instance where someone has
picketed, I mean, do you have
any examples of someone who is
actually besides it may be
verbally threatened or actually
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
so, um, unfortunately, uh, uh,
death threats have been received
by some of these providers as
well as some of the trainees,
um, and in terms of physical
harm, we're not aware of
anything specific, um, however,
there have been incidents around
the country of violence against
either individual providers or
at clinics. So, um, dangerous
situations occurring at clinics.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady and, and I'm glad
nobody at least in this state
has actually been hurt, but I
guess my concern is that when
you're part of a public entity,
um, and transparency and things
of that nature that I mean I
think we all, even in our jobs
get subject to threats and
things of that nature, um, and
so I, I do have concerns about
that, but, um, let me just move
on a little bit when you talk
about travel, so for example,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, the
abortion clinic that.
I don't know that was funded for
in Las Cruces, let's say. I
don't know where that's at in
the planning or up and running,
how will this affect out of
state travel, um, plans for,
let's say doctors, I would
assume be coming in from Texas,
maybe traveling back and forth
on these borders, these border
states, um, could you, uh,
explain a little bit, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, if that
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um, so
there's not anticipated out of
state providers to be traveling
to that, uh, any of the
locations that we're aware of,
um, however, uh, there is there
potentially will be uh
individuals who are, uh,
completing their training in
reproductive health care
services that uh would be
traveling.
Uh, to the state, um, but Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, this can
also deal with, you know,
scheduling of shifts that could
deal with personal travel that
is uh the subject of
conversation because someone is
requesting time off, um, and so
understanding that uh other
states have uh varying
restrictions on access to these
services and we wanna make sure
that these providers feel safe
going about their day to day
business, um, and also training
the next generation.
of OBGYNs.
Right, Mr. Speaker, gentle.
Um, I wanna move on a little bit
to some stuff we discussed in
committee on I believe it's
page.
3, the last, the last section of
your bill and talk a little bit
about um personal identifying
information or sensitive
information, and I know we
discussed Mr. Chair or Mr.
Speaker and, uh, gentle lady,
why is there not a definition
for sensitive information.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um,
this is in part because there is
a definition of the personally
identifying information, um,
which is, which is very limited
actually, so the uh definition
of that is mostly related to uh
identification numbers and the
like, um, and so the sensitive
information just relates to some
of the things that we've
mentioned, um, and the um.
I think that the idea here is
that um the public body needs to
make the determination around
what could be potentially put,
put the provider at risk um of
uh a safety concern, um, and Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I think,
um.
One piece of this is just making
sure we do have some broad
protections for the patients.
Um, the local public body,
however, or the, the public body
still has to do all kinds of
reporting, um, in terms of.
Types of services provided,
number of services, patients
treated, types of insurance
accepted, all the, you know, all
of the reporting, um, that UNM
and other government agencies
have to do, but this is really
to allow uh the entity to
determine how to keep those
providers safe.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady that I have concerns
that sensitive information isn't
defined, um, and could be
expanded how any public entity
pretty much wants to.
I guess expand that information
and so I, I have issues with
that, so I see there's no
definition for that and then
right above it, Mr. Speaker,
General Lady records containing
personal identifying
information, um, and when you go
to the inspection of public
Records Act.
Gentle or Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, how is it defined in that
act?
What you know, you said it's
already I believe defined in
IPRA in another statute because
you talk about how it's defined
in the IPRA Act.
Yes, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, so it's um fairly narrow,
uh, it's, it goes through all
but the last four digits of A
and it lists various numbers
that include credit card number,
driver's license, uh, tax ID.
Full Social Security number, um,
date of birth, um, and then, uh.
He protects a a if you are an
employee of a public body, you
nonbusiness home street address
is to be protected but not the
city, state, or zip code.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, but when you go to.
Section F and 142-6, which is
inspection of public Records
Act. It says protected personal
identifier information means,
um, and I guess I'm wondering
why your bill doesn't say
records containing protected
personal identifier information
um and why the title of what's
in your bill is different from
what's in the 1426 IPRA Public
Records Act, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um, I
can't speculate on that, but I
do know that um.
I do, I do think the intention
there is to reference that
definition. I, I, I don't want
to speculate on the rationale
behind that.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
general ladies. So under F it
says protected personal
identifier information means all
but the last four digits of a, a
taxpayer's identification number
B financial accounting number C
credit or debit card number or
the driver's license number, so
those would be the things that
would be falling Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady under.
Personal identifying.
Information which is again
different from what's protected
personal identifying information
in the IPRA Act, but it would
cover those four things.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, yes, and it continues to
include the uh home street
address but not the city, state,
or zip code.
OK. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. So I
guess the part I mean I, I have
the issues I'm having is section
L because it doesn't mirror the
IPRA Act as far as title and
sensitive information isn't
defined, which I believe would
leave it very broad for any, I
guess, public entity to decide
what is sensitive public
information when the whole
purpose, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady of the IPRA law is to make
sure there's transparency, um,
and I'm glad they're having.
been any acts of violence, but I
also, Mr. Speaker, generally
believe that if you choose to
work in a public entity, whether
it be uh medical provider that's
performing abortions or any
other medical reproductive care,
um, that it's just a little
different than a private entity,
and I'm concerned about these
definitions, um, and so that is
why I'm gonna have a problem
supporting this bill, um, but I
thank you for clarifying some of
that up for me and um
name, Mr. Speaker, I will yield.
There is further debate.
There is for the debate. The
gentleman from Montero, Senator
Block.
Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker,
with the kind gentle lady from
Santa Fe, please yield.
I yield to my friend from
government.
Awesome. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Thank you, gentle lady. So I
just have some questions about
some of the specifics of the
bill, which I don't see many of
them, but Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, I'm just wondering, first
of all, how many people will
this affect? How many public
abortion facilities are there in
the state of New Mexico.
Mr. Speaker, uh, gentlemen, uh,
roughly about 15 individuals.
OK. Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. So 15 individuals
and how many actual facilities
and where are they located?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
that's not in this bill because
it's really specific to the
practice of a medical provider
employed by a public body, so
it's not actually specific to
the location.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, and I see that, so
I, I'm just wondering where
these 15 people are located
across the state then? Are they
in Albuquerque mainly, Las
Cruces? Are they in Santa Fe
where are a majority of the
people located, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, these would be
individuals employed by UNM.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, so you and I and I
believe it's my understanding
that UNM's practice, I think
they may have an abortion
practice at UNM, but that is its
own entity. I don't believe that
it's actually tied to the
university. It's its own entity,
is that correct, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady?
Mr. Speaker, uh, gentlemen, so
the providers are under the
umbrella of the UNM Health. All
right, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. So those providers
are
So do they work for the hospital
then? Would that be the umbrella
that they're under?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, they are
separate from UNM Hospital.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies,
so there, I guess they would
just be directly attached to the
university then, is that
correct?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, they are
employed by the UNM School of
Medicine.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
these individuals, if let's just
say I was someone who wanted to
know data about how many
procedures are performed a year,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so if
I wanted to get that information
somewhere, I would contact the
New Mexico UNM School of
Medicine and with that they
would be still compelled to
respond to the IPRA, but they
just would not be able to put
any sensitive or personally
identifying information. Is that
correct, Mr. Speaker General?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, that's
correct.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, and then I'm
wondering, uh, why is this only
specifically for abortion
facilities and not other kinds
of physicians who may also be
targeted during this current
political climate.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um,
these are the only medical
providers, uh, employed by
public bodies that would be
subject to IPRA that have
experienced this, uh, these sort
of sorts of threats of violence.
OK. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, and I, I believe
earlier the good lady from Curry
Roosevelt, Chavez and a few
other counties asked about.
The words.
Uh, I believe sensitive. I'm
wondering how is it that I would
know what is sensitive or not as
someone requesting an IPRA
versus what is sensitive for the
provider since it is not
defined.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so, um,
basically what we are trying to
do is protect any information
that would cause a security risk
for one of these providers, um,
but it doesn't prevent access to
financial records, clinic, uh,
procedures operations, um,
looking at the types of
insurance that are accepted,
number of patients served, all
of, all of those, uh, all of
those things that UNM um and
other.
Government health agencies
routinely provide, uh, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, just as we'd
like to know how many, uh,
children receive a certain
service from the Department of
Health, uh, all of that type of
information is still available
from UNM.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. So I think that
It's good that we're still able
to get some information, but Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I guess
I'm kind of wondering when it
comes to the actual.
Information, isn't it already
protected through HIPAA laws, we
can't ask for names and and
specific.
things that are wrong or or are
being treated, for example,
isn't that already something
that we cannot get access to
through an IPRA.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, so
individual patient names, um,
and any, any identifying
information of patients, the
types of services that they
receive. I have a lot of
protection under HIPAA, um,
there are also some protections
under IPRA, so, uh, for example,
there is an uh an exception to
IPRA already that that uh.
pertains to records pertaining
to physical or mental
examinations and medical
treatment of persons confined to
an institution, um, so we have
that patient protection already
is an exception in IPRA.
All right, thank you, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady. So then
we're I see on the bill it says
records containing personal
identifying information.
Or sensitive information related
to the practice of a medical
provider employed. So, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, what could
that entail? So if it was
related to that, would it be
things like.
Like billable, uh, services,
would it be things like the
amount of products that they've
requested for a certain
procedure, Mr. Speaker,
generally, I'm just wondering
what, what related to means in
terms of the scope of what can
and cannot be given out.
Mr. Speaker, uh, gentlemen, so
personally identifying
information, uh, so that would
include some of the things that
were described earlier in terms
of.
Excuse me, Social Security
number, etc. as well as
sensitive information which
relates to uh any information
that would put one of these
medical providers at risk.
All right, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, so what would that be
like? Would it be like their
address or something cause I
don't believe we can currently
give that out your personal
address or your personal phone
number or things like that
currently, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, what additional sensitive
information could be withheld.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, actually
there is no exception in IPRA
for personal phone number, I
don't believe, um, but there's
also um documents related to.
Travel.
Resonant and faculty clinical
and shift schedules, activities
and locations of residents, um,
career planning.
Uh, uh, with residents, uh, in
the details of that.
Um, and
Uh, trainees from other states
and how those are our trainees
are being trained, uh,
intellectual property, um, job
applicants and and again this
is, you know, these are in
response to.
Protecting uh individuals these
providers from threats through
phone calls, text messages,
social media, flyers uh in the
mail, uh, at their homes, uh,
that's what we are protecting
here.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
Generalleti, so I can definitely
relate to like some of the
threat stuff when it comes to
the actual phone numbers and
emails and actual addresses,
home addresses, so Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, I'm wondering when
it comes to these information
like clinical information
shifts, uh, career planning, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, would it
still be allowed to be released
under no names and know
personally I.
id ent ify ing information.
So Mr. Speaker, uh, yes, the,
the information, uh, uh,
regarding locations schedules
and, uh, that are tied to the
name of an individual, all of
that would be redacted, um, but
the general information without
that personal information, uh,
would be available.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, because I see the
way it's written, it says
personal identifying information
or sensitive information. So it,
it's either, I guess it's or so
I guess if I wanted that
information, I don't know why
anyone would need it, but let's
just say the clinical schedule
that all your physicians have
it, you and him.
Hospital or I'm sorry, UNM
medical school I could request
that, but if I did, it would
just be blacked out for any
So Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, it
would depend on whether what was
being requested could reflect
the location of an individual at
a specific time.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and then when it
comes to also, since it's so
broad in my opinion, sensitive
information, could it also be
Handwritten information on a
form, for example, because Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, they could
in theory, figure out which
physician was writing which
document or which, which form
and so Mr. Speaker Generaletti,
would that be redacted as well,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I guess
it would depend on whether it
was a handwriting analyst
requesting it or not, uh, but,
but it, but it, in all fairness,
um, I, I'm not sure. I'm not
sure if, if.
How exactly that would work.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
General lady, and I guess that's
my, my question because it's so
subjective, because it's not
defined, so.
Sensitive information that could
indeed be
That, but how would you know who
the person is who's requesting
the IPRA is a handwriting
specialist or just some kind of
research firm and maybe they're
trying to string things
together. Maybe they've got
previous IPRAs from the same
place. They already have
documents that show which
physician's handwriting is
which. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, in theory, we could then
discern which doctor wrote what
based upon their handwriting,
correct?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, you
know, again, uh, the critical
thing in here is not being able
to identify where an individual
will be at a specific time, um,
and so whether the records are
handwritten or not, um, uh, that
you know that that analysis
would still apply.
OK, thank you so much, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, all right,
that's, that helps me on that
one and then also.
I still just kind of have some
questions when it comes to the
actual word sensitive and
It is quite broad. So Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, what if I
got a
And it back, I requested an IPRA
and I felt it didn't include
what I requested because it was
blacked out. Would I need to
have some kind of reasoning from
the medical school as to why
that was blacked out or is it
just completely shielded from me
from asking that.
Mr. Speaker, uh, this would not
deviate from the typical
processes under the inspection
of public records.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and then also in
the IPR law currently has a
burdensome requirement, so if
it's overly burdensome. So Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, wouldn't
this now be potentially limiting
the amount of information that
someone could receive because it
would take extra time to redact
it because we're putting new
exceptions. So Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, how would that work
when it comes to the burdensome
requirement, would it be a lower
standard.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, this
does not impact the burdensome
requirements, so it would be
dealt similarly as uh other
exceptions such as trade
secrets.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, so.
That, OK, so trade secrets, got
it. So,
Currently, can we give out
Trade secrets from UNM medical
school.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, trade
secrets are a broad exemption in
the inspection of Public Records
Act, uh, along with uh a number
of others.
All right, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, so currently I could
request an IPA request from
Doctor ESB's office, for
example, asking specifically how
do you perform a specific
procedure.
Based upon your guidelines that
are currently guidelines, and
that would completely be allowed
currently.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um.
There
I'm not sure how you're uh
question applies to trade
secrets. Those are defined in
case law, um.
Maybe you could rephrase. Sure.
I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, I'm wondering, so since
it's kind of in the same realm
of law, would I be able to
request, let's just say I, there
was a competing medical school
that was also doing these kinds
of procedures and they wanted to
know how UNM's procedures were
being done. And so, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, could they request
currently.
Or maybe when we change the law,
the procedures or the best
practices that have been written
down for how to
do some of these procedures.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so this
does not address anything uh
related to that, um, if that
information exists, um.
The typical all of the IPA law
would apply and so if that
information exists and it did
not have patient information or
personal identifying information
in it, then there's nothing in
this bill that would prevent the
release of that, um, but.
It depends on what information
is available.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady. So then when it
comes to the, I think it says
practice in the bill. It says
relating to the practice. So how
will agencies distinguish
between a medical provider's
practice.
And general employment or
general departmental records
that include identifying
information, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, so this only relates
to personal identifying
information or sensitive
information, um, and it is being
brought to protect uh the safety
and security of these providers.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
but that would just be based
upon the practice. Is that
correct? It would not be based
upon other things in other in
departmental records. Would that
be correct statement, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, this
doesn't apply to non-medical
providers that are not employed
by a public body who do not
perform reproductive health
care.
OK, Mr. Speaker, and gentle
lady, all right, and then when
it comes to
That, so we, we said
reproductive healthcare. Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, does this
not apply to an OBGYN who does
not perform abortions. Mr.
Speaker, uh, gentlemen, no, it
would not.
All right, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, thank you. So how would
the individual requester know
which individuals perform
abortions or not, because that
information would indeed be
shielded from this because it's
due to their practice. So how
would a requester know that?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, that
would be up to the responsive
local public body, um, just as
many other IPRA requests, um,
you know, maybe filed with the
wrong entity, maybe filed with
the wrong individual, um, that,
that the, the current IPRA
practice still applies.
OK. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, and then when it
comes to this idea, have we seen
other states do similar things
to shield public bodies from
providing information that's
sensitive or has personally
identifying information relating
to abortion providers.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
so we have actually one of the
most um.
Most sunshine filled public
records laws, uh, for our
sunshine filled state and so we
actually release a many, many,
many records that uh are not
subject to public records
requests in other states, so
that is one of the reasons that
uh this legislation is so
important for our state.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and I, I guess I
asked that question because
In committees we've seen other
bills.
And there has been a huge
backlash when it comes to the
media and different people,
they've actually been exempted
from these because they need
that for certain requirements
for the the trade or other
things like that. So Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, why is it
that we didn't put any
exceptions in this new piece of
law.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I think
it's because this is so narrow,
um, this is a, a very narrow
exception and Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, I, I too, uh,
reviewed a number of the changes
to IR law that were proposed
this session, um, and this is by
far the most narrow, uh, sliver.
All right, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and I, I just haven't been
able to contact different people
and, in the media and other
places that may need this
information. So Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, uh, can you tell me
a little bit about when it comes
to reporting, do they have to
report to the CDC the data from
UNM medical school relating to
abortions
Speaker, gentlemen, um, not
aware of a CDC requirement for
reporting, but there's certainly
state reporting, um.
And, you know, there's also a
lot of reporting to LFC
regarding all of the operations
of UNM Health Sciences Center,
the hospital, uh, the, uh, all
of the medical practices
contained with UNM Health, um,
there's a lot of transparency
there and regular reports
provided to to us.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. OK, so then that
information, so if someone
wanted to know how many kinds of
abortions are performed at the
UNM Medical Center, that would
still be, or I'm sorry, Unimed
school would still be allowed.
So for example, if someone
wanted to know how many medical
abortions were performed versus
how many in clinic abortions
were performed that information
would still be allowed to be
given out, it would just have to
be redacted. Is that what, what
I'm understanding.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, uh, yes,
as long as it met all the other
requirements of IPRA, um, so if
it, if the information was
available, um, and there were no
per uh personal identifying
information, no medical, uh,
individual patient records
involved in that, all of that
would still apply.
All right. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, and then
when it comes to the UNM medical
schools reproductive or I, I
forget what we call it,
abortion, uh.
Practice.
How many of those records are
given out for any kind of audit
annually. Does UNM audit what
they do annually because I know
some people probably
But IPRA's out there just to see
where the financial records are
going, how much is being spent
on what and so Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, how would that
ensure financial security for
the entity when it comes to the
actual finances with any kind of
audit.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um.
That is not really addressed in
this bill. However, there are
regular reports to LFC, um,
certainly UNM I'm sure undergoes
a number of audits, professional
audits for all of its
departments annually, uh, and
there's a, you know, obviously a
robust administrative process at
UNM.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. So,
I, I'm just kind of trying to
figure out when it comes to
ordering things, certain
supplies and things.
Would someone be able to know
which physician requested what
supplies for the practice
versus.
Uh, just regular things like
pencils and paper.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I would
imagine those things are not
ordered on an individual
physician basis, um, but again
the regular exemptions and I
mean the reg regular
restrictions in IPA would apply
and um.
A request doesn't mean a record
must be created, so it depends
on how the information is
tracked at each and every one of
our public bodies.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
thank you for that information.
So,
I know at least where I've, I've
worked in many places, not, not
a hospital, but I know that
certain physicians have forms
that they fill out of what kinds
of things that they may need for
their practices and so I just
was wondering if that was
something that would be
shielded, would it say this some
some doctor asked for this
amount of supplies and they
would shield that name. Is that
what this would do? Because it
is relating to the practice.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, anything
that would present a safety or
security risk for the provider
would be sensitive information,
um, so I can't really speculate
on the individual hypothetical
because I'm just not familiar
enough with the order forms.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
General Waddy, and I, I'm right
there with you. And I guess
that's why we have uh experts.
So Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
when it comes to the actual IPRA
burden since this, in my
opinion, would probably create a
new burden for the medical
school would we need to hire a
new individual to oversee these
IPRA requests because they will
have a lot more redactions and
we need to be closely guarded.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, no,
um, they already handle, you
know, hundreds of requests a
year, um, so we don't anticipate
that there will be any burden
with this, uh, as was also
reported by UNM and the uh
fiscal impact in their uh agency
analysis.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, that helped me.
On that, so there would be no
added administrative costs is
what I understand. And so, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I wonder,
could agencies face legal
exposure from inconsistent
reactions or disclosures under
this new exemption, and how do
we ensure consistency across the
board. I know we're just talking
about you in a medical, but if I
believe there's a new facility
opening up in Las Cruces where
it, it probably could also
apply. So how do we ensure
everything is uniform.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um,
you know, there's a lot of
training that goes into public
agencies being able to respond
to IPRA in a consistent way and,
and that's done by a number of
associations that, you know, the
local county uh state level, so,
um, this would this is part of
that training.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and then I believe
also from what I read.
That
This could inadvertently maybe
conflict with section 14-6-1A
NMSA, which protects
identifiable patient information
and health records are ready,
Mr. Speaker, General lady, how
would this be different than
that?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, I do
not have a copy of that, but I
would imagine if it uh is
focused on patient records
protection. What we are doing
here is protecting providers,
uh, so this is, this is not
there already protections in
HIPAA and elsewhere around
patient information.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, General,
I think there already are some
protections in HIPAA and
FERPA and then IPRA, of course,
when it comes to personally
identifiable information, but
that was just something I read
in the medical board analysis, I
believe. I think it was on page
3 of that one. And so I was just
wondering if, if you saw this as
any in any way conflicting
because it does indeed have
Information that we're giving
out and it could indeed give out
information about patients, not
the patient's information, but
this patient, some random
patient got 10 amount of
services. So do we see any kind
of conflict in that way?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, so
this does not change anything
about the types of medical
records that can be released in
terms of the patient
identification, so I don't, uh,
I, I don't anticipate.
Any conflict there.
And
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I'm not
sure if you're referring to the
administrative code citation,
um, but I, I think that this is
uh fully within the current.
parameters of the inspection of
Public Records Act.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
generally, and then I believe.
Uh, the medical board said it
could, this could restrict the
medical board from providing
information about licenses to
the public.
And it says the board has an
affirmative duty under a
different section 16-10-19 to
provide personal identifying
information about licenses,
including those that provide
abortion-related care as part of
their employment by a public
body. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, how would this change
that?
Mr. Speaker, that, that is New
Mexico administrative code, so
that is under the purview of the
medical board, um, and if they
felt they needed to adjust that,
uh, they certainly can, however,
this doesn't impact information
about who is licensed in the
state of New Mexico to practice
medicine, which would be in the
purview of the medical board. So
I don't believe that this would
limit their uh current practice
in any way.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
if an individual requested the
license of a physician.
A specific physician which they
would request through them,
would that be unredacted when
it's given out if that
individual was indeed an
abortion provider.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so they
would not be able to provide any
information that would present a
security risk, um, uh, in terms
of their location, their home
address, uh, etc. so, uh, it may
be that the medical board will
need to make some adjustments on
the kind of information, but
certainly, um, they would still
be able to confirm whether
somebody was licensed to
practice and they would
certainly be able to retain
authority over the medical
licenses. OK, thank you, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
OK, well, I, I do think that
that might be something that's a
problem with the medical board
since they did say that if this
proposed amendment IPRA.
The EPA Act was followed, it
would be a gag on NMMB, which is
the medical board to keep
confidential the name of an
address of licenses who provide
abortions, and it says this
could potentially be
inconsistent with the purpose of
IPRA and the medical Practice
Act, they say that the public
has a right to know who is
licensed and practiced medicine
in the state, especially if
they're employed by a public
body, regardless of whether they
provide abortions or not. So,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, do you
have those same concerns that
they have?
regarding the current law and
then the purpose of IPRA.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, it
didn't, I, I didn't view this as
a concern necessarily, and I
believe that what this is is
just they're needing to update
the New Mexico administrative
code which is part of their
internal rulemaking process.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. Well, I maybe we're just,
we just read it wrong or read it
differently, maybe because it
sounds to me like it would be an
administrative burden on them,
and that's why they, they put
this and flagged it because they
think that the reason that we
have IPRA is to allow for all
kinds of information to be
provided regardless because it's
a sunshine thing, right? So, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, other,
other than the medical board,
can you tell me?
Does this conflict with federal
FOIA.
Laws.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, no.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
and how many federal dollars
are funding the UNM School of
Medicine.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, we don't
have that information. OK, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, is, is
there any amount of money that
is funding the UNM school of
medicine.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, we don't
have that information.
I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, could you please repeat
that for me? I apologize. Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, we don't
have that information. OK, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, could you
tell me in any way, shape or
form is the UNM medical school
funded at all with federal
dollars in any way, shape, or
form.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, we don't
have that information, but I, I
would assume there is some
federal funding.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
and I asked that because I don't
want our state law to conflict
with FOIA laws. So if I filed a
FOIA through maybe the
Department of Health or the
Department, some like Department
of Education maybe on the
federal level and I asked for
this information about these
physicians, would the state then
be forced to come back through
that entity and say that no, we
cannot provide these personal
informations because they're
state law, which is a state law,
not a federal law.
restricts that.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, this
bill does not, uh, inhibit the
university from complying with
federal law.
OK, Mr. Speaker, Generalleti, so
then there could potentially be
a loophole then where an
individual would just say, OK, I
can't get this information on
the state level with IPRA, so
I'm just going to file a FOIA
through the Department of
Education or the Department of
Health, and then I would be
compelled, or the university
medical school would then be
compelled to give out that
information. Is that correct?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, it's a,
uh, long hypothetical with a lot
of details that I am not sure
about so I, I, I just can't
answer that question.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, because I know a
lot of those those dollars come
through Medicaid dollars. So Mr.
Speaker, generally, the patients
that we see in the the facility
at UNM.
Do we accept Medicaid there?
Well, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, no
federal Medicaid dollars are
used to fund abortion services,
so Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I'm
not sure of other, uh,
Federal involvement um in the
provision of healthcare at UNM,
but um.
I'm not sure how someone would
make a request under FOIA.
All right, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, because, because I know
that the argument that I've
heard a lot of the time from
these physicians who perform
abortions is, oh, it's a real,
it's a really minor amount of
things that we do in the clinic
and a majority of it is not
abortion related. So Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, when it
comes to the practice itself,
how do we ensure that those
dollars are indeed being um.
Being used not for abortions
because how do we discern that
if the person's practice is a
hybrid practice. It has abortion
and it also has other kinds of
things that may not be abortion.
How do we discern that, Mr.
Speaker, this legislation is
about protecting the safety and
security of the healthcare
providers, so in terms of the
details of federal funding, etc.
that is not subject to any
changes that we are proposing in
this legislation.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and so I agree, but
I also want to maybe push back a
little bit because it says the
practice, it doesn't say.
part of the practice that
relates only to abortions. It
says the practice, so I'm
wondering, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, if this is an obstetrics
and gynecologists, how would
this individual be allowed to
not provide that personal
information relating to things
that are not indeed relating to
abortions.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, uh,
could you rephrase that
question?
Sure, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
so, OK, you have a, you have a
clinic at UNM and I believe we
said the words that were
reproductive healthcare, so that
does not only include abortions,
so what about the portion of the
The whatever they do.
As a practice that is not
abortion related, would they be
able to get that information
unredacted.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, if, if
they were not related to the
provision of abortion services,
the standard IPRA would apply.
This is only related to those
services, um, and Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, um, certainly there
is a lot of information
available in the state about
UNM, uh, through the inspection
of Public Records Act hundreds
of IPRAA requests filed, uh,
each year. So Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, there's this
legislation doesn't change any
of that.
OK excuse the interruption.
There's been a request for the
gentleman to remove, to remove
their jackets. If there's no
Egyptian.
So ordered. Please continue,
sir. I'm my.
No, you're fine. I was, I was
not gonna object to that. So
thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, so.
Getting back to the actual
practice.
How many individuals who are at
this reproductive clinic or
reproductive.
facility at UNM currently do not
perform abortions. We said it
would affect 15 people. How many
individuals would it not affect
in that same area?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, I
can't really answer that
question because the, the number
of staff at UNM Health, UNM
Health Sciences Center, UNA
Hospital is uh incredibly vast
lady,
I'm just talking specifically
about uh Doctor S whatever
Doctor SB oversees in her.
Uh, practice in UNM medical
school. Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
this is only related to the
practice of these specific
medical providers, so, um, that
would be those 15 individuals.
That we mentioned earlier.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. I guess I'm just
having a problem with the, the,
the fine line delineating
between who is exempt from this
and who is not, because if that
doctor that one of the 15 does
things like.
I don't know, uh, maybe they put
out.
Or maybe they just do.
clinical services when it comes
to a checkup, for example.
A checkup, not relating to
abortion, but it is in that
practice. It's one of those 15
people. I'm just wondering how
does the public know the
difference between what they
provided in that case versus an
abortion.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so it,
uh, I would.
Um, direct you to the procedure
for denied requests, um, where
the records custodian must
provide an explanation of any
denied request, um, and provide.
The uh
Provide that within 15 days.
After the request was received.
So nothing in this legislation
changes that, um, and so any
government body when you when
they receive a request for
information, um, and if it falls
into one of the categories of
exemption from IPRA, uh, they
must provide that explanation.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
Yes, I do understand that they,
that they do that, but I'm just
wondering.
I'm wondering who will be
exempted now because I know
there's a new facility that
they're opening in Cruises, for
example, it's $10 million of
taxpayer money and increases,
how many other abortion centers
are slated to be opening across
the state with taxpayer dollars,
and then how many more people
could this apply to and which
individuals in those facilities
would be exempt versus not
exempt if the entire thing was
branded as a reproductive
clinic, for example.
I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker.
Were you asking was that the
question? Uh, yes, Mr. Speaker,
and I can rephrase it if you, if
you'd like.
Well, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
um, it would be 15 individuals,
uh, today I think I don't want
to speculate about uh the
future.
Contractions or expansions, uh,
as we know these things go up
and down.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and they do, however, I'm
wondering when it comes to the
actual services like
The reproductive clinic that's
currently there.
It would only apply to
physicians, right? So Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I could
ask for an EA request for
physician's assistants who work
there if they did or a nurse
practitioner who works there,
and that would be unredacted.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, I
would encourage us to maybe step
this debate away from the
specific individuals because
What this is about is the
record. It is not tied to a
specific individual, so there's
no understanding in this
legislation that, you know,
anything that if I was a doctor,
anything that Doctor Rena did is
now suddenly protected, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, it's about
what type of information is in
the record, um, so if, if a
record includes
Uh, an individuals say personal
patient record if it includes,
uh, personally identifying
information of the medical
provider, um, or sensitive
information, it's really about
the information on the record.
OK, Mr. Speaker, generally, and
I, I get the framing of that,
but the way I read it is the
record is containing personal
information from the specific.
Medical providers practice.
And so I don't think Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, it has to
be an abortion record, it just
has to be a record from the
practice. That's kind of the,
where I'm getting stuck, and I
would maybe ask you for some
clarification on that.
Yes, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, uh,
the legislation states related
to the practice of medical
provider so as we talked about
earlier, this could relate to
educational trainees. This could
relate to residents. This could
relate to, uh, shift planning or
clinical uh practice hours, etc.
that uh specific individuals
working and Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, we're really trying
to ensure that uh these
providers are safe and not
subject to unnecessary threats.
risks that are related to uh
knowing a specific location at a
specific time of a specific
medical provider.
OK, Mr. Speaker, John Liddy, so
when we talked about these
individuals, you also added that
it would include residents.
Is that my understanding since
they're not technically doctors
yet. How are they falling under
this if they are not a medical
provider yet.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so
residents are actually
physicians, um, they are doctors
and, and they would, uh, they're
just receiving additional
training through the practice of
residency.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
and are these individuals
employed by the UNM School of
Medicine. Uh, Mr. Speaker, uh,
gentlemen, yes, typically
residents are provided a salary
at the institution at which they
are serving.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
thank you for that. So then when
it comes to other things that
are not related to UN a medical.
I know we, we didn't want to
really talk about the abortion
facility that's gonna be opening
in Las Cruces, but it's
apparently.
Going to be providing more
abortion training as well. So,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, and
I'm not, I, I don't wanna get in
the weeds, but would that also
apply when it comes to that
facility that would be opened in
cruises.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, I
think it would depend on the
prac if whether it was a
practice of a medical provider
employed by a public body, uh,
so Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, that
the that facility is not change
this, uh, legislation.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
I guess I'm just a little.
I'm just trying to get back to
it because I, I read this
article from Political Report
that named Doctor ESB saying
that.
That uh UNM.
does not offer much training to
medical residents who are
attending medical school out of
state, and she said that they
would have an opportunity to do
that at Las Cruces. So Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
That's kind of what I'm
understanding per your experts,
uh, knowledge. So I'm just
wondering, would it apply in
that instance since it is indeed
potentially also having
residents and then offering
these abortion.
Uh, these abortion.
Abortions in cruises, pardon me.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, uh, my
understanding is that clinic
will be operated by UNM and
owned by UNM, um, but I, I, I
hesitate to speculate about
that, uh, however, if it is a
UNM, uh.
Uh, if it is a public body, uh
that is employing the medical
provider at the facility, um, so
I may have misspoke when I said
that it was owned or operated by
UNM, but if, if a medical
provider is providing services
at that clinic, then, um, and
they are employed by UNM then
yes this will apply.
OK, Mr. Speaker, General Liddy,
thank you for that. And then I
don't know even about what, I
know there's a
I think it's an osteopathic
medicine.
School in Las Cruces, Borrell,
and so, Mr. Speaker generality,
I know that they have received.
Public money in the past since
they are not technically
registered as a public body per
se, would they be also subject
to this?
If they were a public body,
they, they would, but I'm not uh
to be honest, uh, sure of the
status of the Burrell College of
Medicine, I believe it is a
private institution.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and it is, I just know
that back in 2016, they had to
come to the legislature to ask
for, I believe they asked for
money to open the facility to
begin with. So I'm just
wondering if this would also
apply to anything that's
publicly funded, or does it
specifically have to be a public
body. So for example, I know if
I've given out my, my, uh,
capital outlay to a facility
that I have put very, very tight
language. I would like this
money to go to, let's just say a
Um, a medical place that has to
do with.
Something, let's just say uh
mental health care.
And they win that bid through an
RFP process, would they also
apply since the public body is
indeed funding it through public
money.
Mr. Speaker, entities that
receive public funding are not
subject to IPRA unless they are
actually a public body, um, so
there are many, many private
enterprises that receive public
funding, whether it be in
contracts, etc. um, the public
body that is working with them
certainly would be subject to
IPRA, but the private entity is
not.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, that, that helps me
on that one. I just wanted to
make sure that that would not
extend outward to these
non-public bodies and so Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, are there
any other facilities in the
state that
Pardon me, I got a, a
notification on my phone real
quick. What is that?
Oh, there's a dust storm
apparently. OK, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, we're protected
down here in the chamber of the
house. So, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, they, I don't know about
Las Cruces or my, my district. I
got to pray for them because
with some of these uh.
These dust storms are getting
crazy. I think they call them.
Haboobs now, so they're creating
new words for dust storms, but
not to get off the topic of this
bill, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
I'm wondering when it comes to.
Specifics of any other.
Um, institution, does any other
institution perform abortions or
train clinicians in any way to
perform abortions because it's
my understanding right now, it's
not just doctors that can
provide them. Is that correct?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so this
legislation was brought forward
by UNM. I am not aware of any
other public bodies, uh, that
would be covered by this
legislation.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, I am not aware of
any either, but it's good to get
some information because
Uh, you know, you, you and your
expert, you are experts on this,
so I just wanna make sure that
we're
Ensuring that we cover all of
our bases. So, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, I do continue to
have some issues when it comes
to the language of what is
sensitive or not. I feel like if
we were to put a definition in
there that would clear up so
much because I do want to make
sure that I don't keep on having
to wait 15 days and, you know,
oh, we, we sent you information
and it was all redacted, but it
was something that was not
related to abortions and then
also the actual physical clinic.
How do we know what is being
performed that's not abortion
and in my opinion, it would be
easier for an IPRA requesting
individual or records custodian
to just say, OK, let's just
strike this entire page, say
it's all confidential and how
would I know? Because as someone
who's asking for that
information, I wouldn't know.
And then I would also continue
to share the concerns that the
New Mexico Medical Board had
because they would have to
change a lot of their current
procedures that require
sunshine.
these individuals and if they
are indeed.
Registered in New Mexico, I want
to make sure that these people,
we do have access to those
records when it comes to their
licensure cause we want to make
sure these people are licensed.
So I just think there are so
many different things that we
could, we could continue to ask
questions about, but I will stop
there for you, Mr. Speaker, and
thank you so much, gentle lady
from Santa Fe. Appreciate it.
There is for the debate. The
gentleman from San Juan,
Representative Montoya.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the
gentle lady from Santa Fe yield.
I yield to the gentleman from
San Juan.
Um, thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, um, I, I'm gonna
ask quite frankly, several
questions that have been asked,
but I, I'm hoping to be able to
dive a little deeper into your
answers if, if, uh, we can. So
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady.
Um, I too have.
Uh, problems with the second
half.
Of
The changes, uh, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, I think, uh.
Probably fairly reasonable to
say that uh.
Any, uh, record containing
personal identifying
information.
Of a provider that I think that
makes perfect sense. Um, I wish
we would do that for, for
judges.
Uh, for law enforcement, uh,
even for legislators.
Um
So it's not just, it's not just
folks in this industry.
Who uh have people.
Uh
Uh, threaten them as a matter of
fact, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, we heard today.
That there were a couple of
legislators that were threatened
within the building.
So, uh, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, I, I, I don't have a
problem with that portion.
But
Without
Defining down a little bit
better some of these terms. I am
gonna have some trouble with
this. So, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady.
Sensitive information.
It is a really broad term.
So, uh,
Mr. Speaker
Um
I'm wanting to, to, to find out
what's sensitive information is
because I heard it asked a
couple of times.
And each time sensitive
information came back to
Personal identification or or
items that are already covered
under HIPAA.
But that is a very, very broad
term. Could you maybe describe
to me, and if you have an expert
there that can help you with
this, give me an example.
Miss Speaker and gentle lady, of
what's something that would
qualify under sensitive
information that doesn't
already, that wouldn't already
apply to.
personal identifying
information.
Or things that are already
covered under HIPAA. So the
Speaker and gentle lady, what,
give me an idea of what
something that could be
sensitive information.
So Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
um, the, uh, some a a specific
example would be uh a resident
or faculty clinical and shift
schedule with the activities and
the location of the activities,
um, and Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
what we are intending with
sensitive information is not
anything broader than any data
that could cause harm to the
individual if it was
compromised, uh, and so that.
is uh
this personal information that
really ties an individual to a
specific location.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady. I, I believe that
would be completely
Within, uh, the first part of
this which is containing
personal identifying
information.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, uh,
I'm actually a little concerned
about a quorum here, Mr.
Speaker. Um, I'd like to ask for
a call in the house.
folks.
Right, you've got a call
sergeants please complete the
call. We'll stand by until the
call is completed.
Members who are sitting in the
chambers, please go to your
seats so we can complete the
call as soon as possible.
Members, your seats so that we
can properly account for all
members.
Members, your seats please so
that we can account for the
members.
Members, please go to your seats
so that we can complete the
call.
OK, I'm informed that the call
is complete.
All right gentlemen from San
Juan, we are back to you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
And uh thank you gentle lady. So
I don't know if I need to ask
this again, but as a gentle lady
yield.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the
gentleman from San Juan.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Um, so
gentle lady.
I am
the, the big concern.
Once again is is two things, and
we're, I'm gonna spend almost,
I'm gonna spend all of my time
on this.
Miss Speaker and gentle lady.
Sensitive
Information
is very
Very
Broad
And Mr. Speaker and gentle lady.
Related to the practice is also
very, very broad.
Um
So, in, in
In, in your last answer, I'm not
sure that I got, uh, a, an
example.
Of what
Could be considered sensitive
information. So I'm, I'm gonna
ask some questions based on
that.
Um, Mr. Speaker and gentle lady.
Under sensitive information.
Uh, could that be?
What type of procedures?
Are being performed at a
One of these facilities.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, no.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady.
If
What
If, if what
Your debate has indicated so
far.
This is all about not
Connecting
Someone's a a a provider or
someone who works at a facility,
their personal information, just
compromising their personal
information.
Already we know that.
A patient's personal information
cannot be compromised. That's
already covered under HIPAA.
So
What
Good sensitive information
pertain to.
I can't, I'm, I'm just not able
listen to to representative
blocks uh um.
discussion with you earlier. I,
I'm still not finding out.
How are we limiting or how
expansive.
Is sensitive information.
Well, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
um, personal identifying
information is really limited
because it's talking about uh
individual social security
number, um, the, uh.
only the last four digits of
their driver's license, etc. and
so Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, what,
what the sensitive information
and, and maybe it would help if
I gave you an example. You could
have uh a resident seeking
training, uh, emailing an
inquiry to a member of the uh
faculty at uh UNM and asking,
uh, you know, I'd love to talk
to you. What are, you know.
What are the opportunities to be
received resident training, um,
at this facility and Mr.
Speaker, uh, gentlemen that
could, uh, turn into a
conversation about dates, times,
travel plans that then may
Make them into a target, um,
particularly if they are
traveling from a place that has
uh more restrictions on
reproductive health services in
our state, um, there may be
concern um that they, uh, at, at
the place of their where they
reside could be the target of uh
any kind of threat or violence.
So Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
that's a specific example, but
basically we are trying to
protect the safety and security
of health care providers that
are providing.
These services reproductive
health care and abortion
services at a public body.
Speaker and gentle lady, that
would have been, I think, more
easy to
to put in here than than the
language that's here. I, I,
since this would become law,
this becomes a legal document.
Sensitive information.
Can become anything.
Who
Is the person or who is the
group or who determines
What sensitive information is.
Who, who limits that language or
who makes it expansive. Is that
completely within the purview of
Uh, the, the institution itself,
is it the institution that will
then, uh,
Put together
Um, a document that says.
This is all of the information.
That that can't be IPRAD.
And under that
They would determine.
What sensitive information is,
if not that institution, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, who?
Or what entity would determine
what is sensitive information.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, it's a
great question and as spelled
out in the inspection of public
Records Act. It is the records
custodian and Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, it may help to look
at some of the other exceptions
because some of the language
there, um, is, is similarly, uh,
in need of interpretation by
records custodians, so for
example, you have long range or
strategic business plans of
public hospitals discussed in a
properly closed meeting.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
that's another set of terms that
that isn't defined, um,
certainly, you know, uh, there's
a number of things regarding uh
vulnerabilities in IT systems,
um, that you know that
information is sort of evolving
each day as IT systems evolve
and so really the burden is on
records custodians to deal with
all of IPRA and all of the very
many requests that they're
getting.
So Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
um,
Records custodians.
Who, who does a record custodian
work for?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, the
records custodian is employed by
uh whatever agency, uh, the
request is filed to.
So Mr. Speaker and gentle
ladies, so
The entity.
Gets to determine.
What is sensitive information? I
think you, I think that is the
answer to my question.
Which is who gets to determine.
So, uh, I would imagine whoever
the record custodian works for,
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady
would have some say so as to
what would be considered
sensitive information. Would you
agree with that or would you
disagree?
Yes, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
um, so the way the IPRA law
works, the records custodian,
um, uh, determines whether the
uh
Determines the records that are
responsive to their requests,
um, but Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
I would also, um,
Raise the enforcement of the
inspection of public Records
Act, and so enforcement can be
brought by the attorney general,
the district attorney in the
county of jurisdiction, um, or a
person who's written request can
has been denied, can uh go to
district court.
So thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, but if, if this
document, if this bill passes in
its current form,
It says
Or sensitive information
relating to the practice.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
uh, a little bit ago you
wandered into something into in
debate with the former with
Representative Block and that
was uh trade secrets.
Um, what I, I didn't hear that
debate was trade secrets.
Um, was that?
Something that you were saying
was operable, or were you saying
that that was protected and, and
how did that how did that fit in
that discussion? I, to be
honest, I just heard you bring
up trade secrets and I didn't
hear the context.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so trade
secrets is another one of the
exceptions in the umbrella.
So thank you Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady.
So that kind of, that kind of
Brings me to.
The second part of why I'm, I'm
having a lot of uh problem with
this bill, and then it says
relating to the practice.
So Miss Speaker and gentle lady.
If the practice houses.
Um, not just uh abortion.
Uh, procedures, but any other
procedure that takes place in
that office.
If the records custodian.
were to determine
That that that was sensitive
information.
Could they not avoid.
Um, could they not avoid.
Being IPR, if that was
determined by this one
individual that works for the
entity that is being IPRAD.
Um, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so
if there was sensitive
information that was requested
the records custodian would need
to provide a denial and the
reason for the denial within 15
days, um, and so Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, the customary
procedure under IPRA applies.
So thank you, Mr. Speaker, and,
and gentle lady.
So I'm gonna.
I'm going to um bring up
something that took place, you
know.
8-9 years ago, 10 years ago,
something like that. And it was
a kind of a
An investigation that ended up
taking place with, um, with, uh,
The, the house health sciences
department.
At
Uh, UNM
And Miss Speaker and gentle
lady.
If, if this were in place today.
I'm not sure that these
practices would have been
uncovered.
So Mr. Speaker and gentle lady.
Um
The, there was a situation
where where body parts of, of
babies were being
Uh, provided.
To
UNM Health Sciences department.
Um, it, there was some.
Residents that were being
trained at a non-UNM.
Abortion facility, late term
abortion facility, I won't name.
Um
And
There was kind of a, a give and
take between the this abortion.
Provider
And with
Uh, UNM
Health Sciences department.
But in the end, what
came to light, um, Mr. Speaker,
and gentle lady.
was that there were body parts
that were being taken from this
one abortion provider.
There was some level of let's
just say,
consideration.
Uh, some of it was, there was,
there was money, some of it was.
Uh, residents who are being
provided to that facility to
work at that facility.
Uh, the, the.
Abortion provider in question
was uh had been named as a
professor emeritus.
And the state of New Mexico
because of that relationship
with him was providing uh his
malpractice insurance. So the
state was the provider of
malpractice insurance for a
private business.
All of this came to light now,
um,
Out of that, uh, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, uh, there were some
federal laws.
That were broken
there were no state laws. We
didn't have any laws in the
state of New Mexico that
addressed this, but Mr. Speaker
and gentle lady,
There were federal laws that
were broken. Um, in the end,
there were folks at UNM that
either quit or were let go.
Um
Some have just relocated to
another part of the state.
But Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
Without having
This opportunity
To be able to
Investigate what was going on.
At UNM Health Sciences
department.
This would be continuing.
Today
And so Mr. Speaker, and, and
gentle lady.
The concern I have is.
If this law were in place.
At that time
And the records custodian.
Uh, was able to say that is.
Uh,
sensitive information and it
would be sensitive because
people were unhappy with it.
People all across New Mexico
were unhappy with that. In the
end,
That, uh, uh.
Funneling of uh baby body parts.
Which ended up at UNM, which
ended up being
sold
Two other
Research
Institutions
Across New Mexico.
That would have never come to
light.
So Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
I'm very concerned about
sensitive information and Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, I, I
don't believe you're able to
give me any guarantees.
That something like that
couldn't just be covered up.
That that could be sensitive
information.
That would potentially make
folks unhappy.
Maybe protests would take place.
Um, or whatever.
And so
I, I'm just wondering if you
Would be interested in changing
that at all, um, Miss Speaker
and gentle lady, if the, if the
purpose is to get this passed.
To where we are
Keeping the personal
information.
Personal identifying information
which would be.
Everything that you described
earlier, Miss Speaker and gentle
lady, such as
Uh
Social Security number, address.
Uh, maybe the name name of
employees, their addresses,
their Social Security
information.
Um, it, it appears to me if
that's the sole purpose of this
so that, so that people can feel
safe.
Uh, in their persons.
Um, would there be any interest
on your part to
To alter this so that what we're
not doing is protecting.
Illegal conduct.
Such as took place in New Mexico
within the last 10 years.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
so this the inspection of public
records Act in denials of
information under the inspection
of Public Records Act, um,
doesn't come to bear on any
allegation of uh violation of
the law, whether it be civil or
criminal, so you know if someone
brought suit or someone brought
a criminal charges against
anyone, um, this, this does not
change that and Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen.
Um, we really
Uh
The
The folks at UNM and the medical
providers, uh, are really
strongly about sensitive
information and Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, I have to take their
lead because they are the ones
that are receiving, uh, threats
of violence they're the ones
that are looking over their
shoulder when they're going to
their car. So Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, um, for all those
reasons, uh, I, I, I do not want
to amend that portion.
Well, Mr. Speaker and generally,
what about the section where it
says relating to the practice
because Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, I think
I think that's the concern here
as well, because
Under that term relating to the
practice.
Uh, this, uh transfer of body
parts that was taking place.
Um, the
The, uh, the.
Payment that was being made to
this doctor of another.
Uh, uh, of a private abortion
provider here in New Mexico that
was uh that his malpractice
insurance was being paid for by
the state of New Mexico.
That would all be relating to
the practice.
And Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
if this language were not in
place, all of this would still
be going on today.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
what, what happened that really
brought this to light.
Was the same thing was
happening.
Uh, in the private sector, um,
with, uh, with, uh.
Another organization that I'm
not going to mention, but there
was an organization that was
Uh, doing the same thing they
were.
Let's say.
Harvesting is the wrong word,
but they were taking after an
abortion.
That had taken place there were
body parts that were then being
sold to other research
facilities.
But the UNM
It, it became called the UNM
model nationally.
This idea of being able to
Uh
Barter, let's say, and, and, and
I think the only reason the
Speaker and generally became
really a problem was because
there was
Dollars that were being paid
from other research facilities
to help pay for I'm worried that
related to the practice covers
that.
Um, do you, would you agree that
that could be covered under
this, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
the, the only information that
is uh not available is really
related to that safety
information for these individual
providers, so information uh
requested about, uh, you know,
the information about the uh
clinics and the number of
patients served, you know, how
many of the patients are
indigent patients, all those
kinds of stats.
sticks could still uh and
information could still be
gathered, um, and Mr. Speaker,
gentleman is routinely reported.
And again, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, um, when we get into
allegations of uh any kind of or
any kind of investigation, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, um, IPRA
does not shield public bodies
from being subject to
investigations, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, we know that due to
investigations of conduct at uh.
misconduct at at many different
uh whether it's state, local,
uh, public bodies and Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, I, I think
we want to ensure that that can
continue, however, uh, for
routine.
Public information requests, uh,
we need to ensure that these
providers are safe, um, and
they're not subject to threats
and so, uh, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, um, there's nothing
in here, I think that applies to
the situation that you're
describing.
So Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
I agree.
that nothing would shield them
from an investigation, but Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, an
investigation would have never
taken place and what happened at
UNM had there not been the open
process in the uh in the IPRA
request process. This would
completely do away with that.
So, Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
I, I, I disagree with you that
that this is limited just
To
Uh, protecting someone from uh
their personal information
getting out and I, but I do
believe I have an amendment that
will address that. So Ms.
Speaker and gentle lady, I'm
going to introduce an amendment.
I've got to sign it, Mr.
Speaker, um, and I would like to
have a roll call vote.
Can we do a roll call vote while
we're on the call of the house.
I think that's against the
rules.
Mr. Speaker, I do not believe
that is the case. We can do a
roll call during the call just
testing you.
You got roll call. Bring the
amendment down, please.
Gentlemen, can you read the
number on the bottom left?
Yes, uh, Mr. Speaker, the
The 232 number is 232-073.1,
let's get this passed out and
post it online. I'll come back
to you to explain it.
Right, I believe the amendment's
been passed out and it is posted
online, the gentleman to explain
the amendment.
Uh, yes, Mr. Speaker, uh, the
amendment simply removes on page
one and on page 3.
The term
Sensitive or sensitive
information. So Mr. Speaker, uh,
It would read
Any, uh
Uh, amending the inspection of
Public Records Act 2.
Um
To accept from disclosure any
record containing personal
information.
Uh, personal identifying
information related to the
practice of a medical provider
who performs medical services
related to abortion. So Mr.
Speaker, uh, the only thing that
this does
I keep.
An abortion provider from
within, obviously within their
own business.
Uh, or a, or or within their own
institution from being able to
exempt.
When it says sensitive
information here, uh, let's, we
could say embarrassing
information.
Or whatever could be exempted,
it just protects the private
information of the individuals
working or related to the
practice uh of a medical
provider who performs medical
services related to an abortion
that is what this amendment
does. I believe it cleans it up.
I believe it does. Everything,
uh, Mr. Speaker, that the bill
sponsor says the intent of the
bill is.
But Mr. Speaker, what it does is
it keeps.
Uh,
I, a, a state entity that is
involved in abortion practices
from shielding.
Practices that could be either
illegal or embarrassing.
Your lady is this a friendly.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, and, uh,
gentlemen, it is not, um,
because it doesn't cover any of
the items that we intended to
cover, so travel plans, shift
schedules, locations, uh,
activities of these trainees and
these providers, the only thing
that would be protected, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, if we adopt
this amendment is all but the
last four digits of a tax ID
number, or credit card number,
driver's license number, um, all
but the.
person's date of birth, Social
security number and then their
street address, um, but not the
city state or zip code, so Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, what would
be left in the bill would not
adequately protect the providers
so it is not a friendly
amendment.
Right, General lady from Berliar
Hockman Hill.
Mr. Speaker, I moved the table
House floor amendment number 12
Senate Bill 57. We're in a
tabling motion to house 4
amendment number 12 Senate Bill
57, a vote of yes. The amendment
is tabled. I would have been
nowhere back in the amendment.
The vote is now open.
What was about to close.
The borders are closed by 42 in
the affirmative, 24 in the
negative. House floor amendment
number 1 to Senate Bill 57 has
been tabled. Gentlemen, back to
you.
Yes, Mr. Speaker, um.
I think it's unfortunate.
Knowing in recent history what
has taken place.
At a at our premier New Mexico
institution.
And the, and Mr. Speaker, the
cover-up that took place in the
lead up to this information
coming out.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, to the point
where people had to leave.
Uh, UNM because of this
information.
I'm
Concerned
That without this,
Um, the only way to get this
information, Mr. Speaker, uh,
is, I believe.
Um, we as legislators.
We are going to have to make
those requests because we're
kind of outside of the IPRA
request process and the Speaker,
and, and, uh, body what I'm
really concerned about as well
is I'm afraid that if it looks
like we're
Shielding information,
especially where there are
Medicaid dollars.
Involved, um, I'm afraid that
the only folks who are going to
be able to look into this is
going to be from the federal
government side.
And so, uh, Mr. Speaker, I'm
very, very, very concerned about
that. um, Mr. Speaker, I do have
further questions.
So Mr. Speaker, um,
This goes back to Mr. Speaker
and gentle lady as to
Your intent of the bill so we
can get it on record, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady that the
intent is not for records
custodians.
To withhold information.
That
is about.
What, uh, practices, Mr.
Speaker, are potentially taking
place there, um, or whether if
there were requests of how many
uh out of state.
Patients are part of the total,
there would be nobody's, Mr.
Speaker, and generally, there
would be nobody's personal
information or travel or
anything related to a
Uh, individual employee, but it
would just be more general
information. It is not your
intent that this language would
prohibit.
Or that would allow uh that this
language would not allow.
Uh, a, a records custodian to
make that not.
Iparable, Mister Speaker and
gentle lady, if that's a word.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I, I
think I followed all of those,
but I will just say.
Um
That is correct that
There is nothing in this
legislation or the intention of
this legislation to prevent
anyone from having an
accountability with public
bodies, uh, knowing what kinds
of services are being provided,
knowing how many individuals are
being served, knowing, uh,
generalized statistics that are
de-identified about those
individuals that are being
served, um, and so Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, the intention of this
legislation is simply to ensure
that these providers are safe,
uh, and, uh, that we are not
providing information that
would, uh, increase any threat
of violence to them.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady. So, um,
Any instance of uh
Uh, a one of our.
State
uh, funded abortion.
clinics such as the one that's
gonna be coming online in the
southern southern part of the
state if there are other.
Um, procedures taking place
there that are not related to
abortion.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady and
that are not covered under
HIPAA.
And, or are not covered under
trade practices.
Uh, um.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady.
with those things in your mind
with this bill and your
intention is that those things
would still be able to be, uh,
requested through the IPA
process?
Yes, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um,
again, as long as we're
protecting the patient
information in those kinds of
records, uh, and I'm complying
with IPRA and HIPAA.
Um, yes.
Thank you Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady.
Um, also with this, um,
Since
These procedures, uh, many of
them provided through Medicaid,
um, there's nothing through this
bill that would stop the.
FOIA process, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, there's nothing
that would, uh, be deemed to be
excluded if someone were to make
a request through FOIA, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, that's
correct.
So Mr. Speaker and gentle lady.
I'm very concerned because I
was, I was involved.
Uh, with looking in, uh, looking
into the practices that were
taking place at UNM. It was a
big black eye.
For New Mexico
Very concerned.
Uh, the issue had been brought
up to, at that time, the Board
of Regents.
Frankly, who
At the time
Uh, kind of had to be arm
twisted into looking into it.
But Mr. Speaker, in, in, and
gentle lady.
The federal government's the one
that looked into it. There was
an entire committee convening on
issues like this and it looked
into it. Ms. Speaker and gentle
lady, I think.
The more that we close the door.
On
Sunlight
I think the more that there is
an ability for folks who
Choose
To hide bad practices will do
so.
Um, we know that's the case with
elected officials we've done a
whole lot in this body to shine
the light rather than to
Uh, avoid the light and Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, I think
this.
Uh, it may not be your
intention.
But I think unintentionally.
We are shutting the light out
from
A group of folks that uh have in
in in recent history.
Not been trustworthy.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
It's for the debate, young lady
from Donana Sierra Socorro,
Representative Da.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Does the
gentle lady yield?
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the
gentle lady. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker, and I'm sorry, I was in
um a Senate hearing on a bill,
and so I missed part of the
earlier debate, but my first
question is on page 2, line 5,
Part D, portions of law
enforcement records as provided
in why, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, um, how would restricting
access to law enforcement
records, protect someone who
feels like at their workplace,
they're looking over their
shoulder, they feel intimidated.
How would that prevent that?
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, that
is part of the existing
inspection of public Records
Act.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and
thank you, gentle lady. And so
on the, what is the definition
of the medical provider, that in
itself is an agency, correct?
It's not a, it's not the doctor,
the physician, the assistant.
What is the definition of
medical provider.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so the
medical uh provider referred to
on line 13 would be uh
physician, physician assistant,
nurse practitioner, etc.
employed by a public body. Um,
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, I
have seen a contract that is
between the Planned Parenthood
and Rocky Mount Planned
Parenthood of Rocky Mountain.
It's about 1 over a million
dollar contract. And in that
document, it, in the first line,
it's over a million dollars for.
these types of services. And,
um, it's in the first line of
the contract, it referenced
Planned Parenthood of the Rocky
Mountains, and then thereafter
known as provider. Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, are they considered
a medical provider?
Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies, so
this is only for providers
employed by a public body and in
the term employment and
employed, um, there's there's
lots of case law on that and
lots ofs to that in the statute,
uh, and so those are those are
actual employees they're not
contractors, uh, etc.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and
thank you, gentle lady. Um, so
in regards to is, is you and
him, that's who's with you, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, let me
reintroduce the uh head of the
obstetrics and gynecology
department at UNM.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and
thank you, gentle lady. Um, I
understand that they're planning
to expand their abortion
services and practices
throughout the state. Um, is
that being based out of the
taxpayer funded program at Las
Cruces, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, um, this legislation
doesn't deal with that and, and
I, I'm not, I, I don't have that
information.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank
you, gentle lady. So,
You can't speculate, no
policies, no procedures, nothing
of the sort would be considered
sensitive only be.
What, what is this bill going to
protect that isn't protected
now.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um, so
first and foremost the personal
identifying information includes
items like the full date of
birth, full social security
number, driver's license number,
street address, so that will now
be protected for medical
providers, um, and secondly, uh,
with sensitive information we
are covering um things like uh
resident and faculty clinical
and shift schedules, um, the
activities and locations of
these activities, um.
the travel plans, uh, resident
inquiries regarding training,
uh, Mr. Speaker and gentle
ladies, so we are protecting the
providers from threats of
violence. Thank you, Mr. Speaker
and thank you, gentle ladies. So
if a resident is at a clinic in
Gallup where I believe UNM has
publicly, there's documentation
saying that they're expanding
their services there and a
resident assists with uh an
abortion and is concerned
about something happened there
with these residents also be uh
do they also have to fill out
like non-disclosure agreements,
sensitive information, if
they're asked to do something or
see something that they don't
think follows best practices.
Could they name that doctor, um,
professor, what, what is what's
the restriction of the
residents? Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, the only services provided
in Gallup are services for high
risk pregnancies, um, that does
not include abortion services.
So Mr. Speaker, General Lady, I
don't, I don't think.
that that would fall under this
uh exemption, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, I've seen a
document that they plan to
expand their services there, but
back to the question, if a
resident at any place where
these services could be
provided, will the students be
filing non-disclosure agreements
if they see something that's
contrary to best practices, are
they allowed to report it or are
they having, how will you keep
residents or students, folks who
are participating in the
training, what happens to their
right to disclose something
they've seen or where they saw
it.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, this
legislation doesn't impact that
at all, um, that, that is
completely outside of this
legislation what this
legislation relates to is only
increase subject to the
inspection of uh Public Records
Act, so this is for requests
filed for public records under
the IPRA.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank
you gentle lady. I'm asking
these questions because this is
regarding very sensitive
information that over 56% of New
Mexicans feel that should not be
being paid for by taxpayer
funds, and it is a highly
sensitive and we obviously want
those folks working at UNM to be
safe, but we also want to make
sure that we're being
transparent and open with
something that's being funded by
New Mexico taxpayer funds. Um,
so,
If, do they, can their policies
and procedures, are they exempt
from public record?
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, uh,
no to the extent that they don't
involve uh any identification of
an individual where they might
be practicing their schedule,
etc.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and
thank you, gentle lady. So,
This is only in regards to
personal identifying
information. How is that
sensitive? Why not just spell
out name, date of birth,
sensitive in what, what is the
other that what's the sensitive
information part?
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, um, as
previously mentioned, this
includes resident and faculty
clinical and shift schedules,
um, inquiries from uh residents
who are seeking training, um,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, this
is uh related to could be
individual travel plans,
coordinating leave, time off,
etc. uh, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, we are protecting the
locations of these providers.
Because they have faced such
incredible uh threats.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
you're protecting the location
of the facilities that are
taxpayer funded that will
perform the procedures.
No, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, it
is for the providers themselves.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle ladies. So the people,
the people who perform the
abortions, OK, so their
addresses will not be disclosed.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
correct. OK. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, but the
clinics will still, you know,
since they're publicly funded
and taxpayer dollars are funding
this. Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
and those clinic addresses will
still be
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, yes.
OK. Their names will not be
their birth dates will not be.
What if, um, OK, thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Thank you, gentle lady.
See you know for the debate, you
need to close.
Mr. Speaker, I move that Senate
Bill 57 do now pass.
We are on final passage of
Senate Bill 57. The vote is now
open.
The vote's about to close.
The vote is not closed by a vote
of 42 in the affirmative, 25 in
the negative. Senate Bill 57 has
duly passed this House.
Mr. Speaker
I'd like to release a call on
the house.
Right.
The house they call the house
has been released no objection.
Gentle lady from Santa Fe,
Sandoval.
In Los Alamos, Representative
Chandler.
Are you ready on item number 29.
Yes, Mr. Speaker, will you get
me to that point that all action
has served for place in Centervi
72 on final passage has been
taken. It is not subject to
debate. Amendment to
substitution, the general lady
to explain the bill. Senate Bill
72 enables nonprofit condominium
associations to conduct business
remotely, Mr. Speaker.
I, um, move that House Bill 72
do now pass. final passage of
Sanna bill 72.
The vote is not open.
The vote is about to close.
The vote is not closed by a vote
of 66 in the affirmative, 0 in
the negative. Senate Bill 72 has
duly pass his house.
The lady from Berlin was up
Parajon. Are you ready on item
44?
I am, Mr. Speaker. Can you get
me to that point a necessary for
place in Senate Bill 36 as twice
amended on final passage has
been taken and it is not subject
to debate amendment or
substitution the gentle lady to
explain the bill. Mr. Speaker. I
would also request that my two
expert witnesses be let in.
Marcela Diaz, who's the
executive director of Somosum
Paluido and Gabriela Ibanez
Guzman, who's a staff attorney
at Somos.
Mr. Speaker, um, Senate Bill 36
does 2 as twice amended does two
things. Um, number one, it
creates a new section in chapter
10 called the Non-Disclosure of
sensitive Personal Information
Act, and this would create a
uniform policy across our state
agencies, um, of how state
employees must handle our
personal sensitive information.
It also establishes a list of
categories of sensitive
information not to be disclosed
to outside agencies as well as
enforcement mechanisms and civil
penalties.
It also contains exceptions to
when this information can be
disclosed, for instance, as part
of the function of the state
agency.
And the second thing that this
bill does is amend the motor
vehicle code to add safeguards
when it comes to information
with the in the MBD database and
its potential use to enforce
federal criminal immigration
laws, uh, Mr. Speaker, I stand
for questions.
There is representatives,
Martinez.
I think, Mr. Speaker, will the
A lady from Berlio yield.
I yield to my friend.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, kind
lady. I, I have just.
One question.
Um
And I brought this up in debate
in judiciary.
My concern
Is that
Agencies like the Department of
Corrections.
Or barred by.
Sharing information with
federal.
Law enforcement agencies, not
only ICE, but federal law
enforcement agencies.
Um
So my question is, can law
enforcement
Officers
Both state and federal use the
information that you're talking
about in Senate Bill 36.
to investigate criminal
activity.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, yes,
if this bill passes, private
data brokers will have to
certify that they will not sell
their driver's information for
immigration purposes, but, um,
except for those purposes of
investigating criminal activity,
um, so Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, this does not tie the
hands of law enforcement when
investigating criminal activity.
Thing, Mr. Speaker, thank you,
kind lady.
There is further debate you from
Montero, Representative Block.
Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker,
with the kind gentle lady from
Bern Leo, please yield. I yield
to my neighbor from Otero. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. I had no idea
we would be.
Debating this bill like 3rd, so
I didn't have my little.
Little gadget, but Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, uh, first question,
so I'm just trying to
understand, so what information
are we not allowed to give out
now when it comes to
immigration, uh, and what are we
restricting on this bill?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, could
you clarify what part of the
bill you're referring to are you
talking about the first part,
the second part?
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, good
question. So, uh, well, there's
a lot of parts to your bill. So
I guess I would just start off
when it comes to the sensitive
personal information without
meeting strict exceptions.
And you're amending the motor
vehicle code. So I guess let's
just start with the prohibiting
agency employees. Let's just
start there.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, as defined in the
bill, sensitive personal
information means an individual
status as a recipient of public
assistance or as a crime victim.
It also means sexual
orientation, gender identity,
physical or mental disability,
medical condition, immigration
status, national origin and
religion, social security number
and your tax, um, identification
number.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, you, you speak, uh, better
than I can write, so I
apologize, but I did get all of
them. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, first of all, we, we
talked about the gender
identity, sexual orientation,
Mr. Speaker, generalydia, I
asked this question because I
know that currently I believe it
was an executive order under the
governor or maybe it was a bill
that we passed last year that
collects that information
voluntarily. So, Mr. Speaker,
general lady, currently, are we
giving that information out?
Mr. Speaker and gentle, uh,
gentlemen for the purposes of
the first section.
Um, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
for the purposes of this first
section, um, which agency
specifically are you talking
about?
Mr. Speaker, genity, I am not
quite sure. I believe it might
be through do it or maybe
departmental workforce
solutions. I actually believe it
was relating to all different
state agencies that they
voluntarily accepted that
information.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, uh, I
we don't know that level of
detail for every single one of
the state agencies, uh, we just
want to standardize it across
state agencies.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
we're just not allowing it to in
any way be given.
Out or are we restricting it
within the agency? How, how are
we restricting that information.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
what this bill says on page 2 is
it's really uh preventing the
intentional disclosure of that
sensitive personal um
information by virtue of that
employee's position and and
receiving that information just
as you as you stated that it has
been collected and Mr. Speaker
and gentlemen, um, unless if
it's through the exceptions as
listed in um page 2 and 3 of
this bill.
OK. Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and then my, my
question about that is,
I believe.
Some of these are already
protected from being given out.
So, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
I'm just wondering why this
creates a new chapter
specifically for sensitive
personal information when
several of these categories like
Social Security number, medical
data are already protected under
existing federal and state laws.
Um, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
what we are trying to do with
this bill and the purpose of
this bill for this first section
is to create uniformity in um
the code in amongst our state
agencies, um, and many other
local jurisdictions in New
Mexico already have that, um,
and we just want to make sure
that it's all the same
throughout the agencies.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. Then, when it comes
to the bill's definition, this
is actually very similar to the
previous bill. So, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, I'm wondering how
will the bill's definition of
the sensitive personal
information in section 2.
Interact with existing HIPAA,
FERPA or state confidentiality
statute. Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, um, if, if you look
on page 3 of the bill, what's
stated is that um one of the
exceptions is when such
disclosure is expressly
permitted by the Federal Health
Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, um,
which is HIPAA. Alright, thank
you, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I
do see that when it comes to
HIPAA.
So
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, let me
just, I'm just checking to see
if this is new language. Yeah,
it's all new. OK.
So Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
when it comes to that.
Why doesn't it explicitly
mention protections for like
biometric information or digital
identifiers which are
increasingly recognized as
sensitive data nationwide.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, which
agencies would be collecting um
biometric data. Speaker, lady,
well, I know that there are many
emerging markets happening. I
know that Department of
Information Technology does some
information regarding that. I
believe that the
Department of Health also has
certain information relating to
that as well as the department
of uh.
What is it called? uh Healthcare
Authority now, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, they may have some
of the sensitive information
such as digital identifiers
where they code different
patients, etc. So how is that
protected?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, yes,
those are certainly emerging,
um, types of data and we'll
continue to look at those. Be
happy to collaborate on a bill
like that in the future.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. Good answer, but I think
they currently actually do get
that information uh department
at least uh HCA or
Department of Health when it
comes to those digital
identifiers because they, they
sometimes get the information,
they put it in the system and
then they kind of
de-identify it. So, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, how would this work
with that currently?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, I,
I'm not familiar with that
explicit kind, certainly, um, as
a Gen Z caucus we could
certainly pioneer on that, uh,
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
however, for the purposes of
this bill, it is all that is
listed on page 2.
OK. Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. So let's go back to
page 2 to make sure that we're
covering everything on there.
So,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, we're
talking about contractors as
well, made to a state contractor
and I don't know what line I'm
on. I'm on the amendments in
context on the bill, but Mr.
Speaker, it's, it's F I believe.
F as in Frank. So, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, what is that?
Entail when it comes to that
state contractor.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen on
page 3, I believe you're talking
about subsection F.
Correct, F.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
the state has so many
contractors, um, and uh and
vendors, many contractors, so,
um, all that we're asking is
establishing these um
establishing this across the
agencies and that the agencies
would then when they contract
those contractors would agree in
writing to be bound by um the
same restrictions on disclosure
that are imposed by the um by
the state employees of this
section.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. The next I have a
question. I think it's on page 6
where I'm gonna start going to,
I didn't print out the bill, so
I've been going on my computer.
But Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, my
question is.
I believe the bill criminalizes
disclosure related to federal
immigration enforcement. Is that
correct?
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
um, not felony criminal
provisions of the federal
immigration and Nationality Act.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies,
so what provisions would it not
include?
If it doesn't include those,
what would, what are we not
allowed to give out.
Um, Mr. uh, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, um, personal
sensitive information, um.
And noncriminal um felony
information.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
non-criminal felony information.
So is there a felony that's not
criminal?
Sorry, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, I almost spoke. Um,
yeah, felonies are all criminal,
um, civil, civil. Yes. Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, thank you
for that clarification. I was
about to ask you which felonies
are not criminal, but House for
Amendment number one.
I don't know about that, Mr.
Speaker, uh, gentle lady, but,
so tell me about this civil
cases. What, what is a civil
offense because I believe most
or some kind of like, like at
least a misdemeanor. So what
does a civil offense that we
would not be able to get
information out to them about.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
um, I must spoke again.
Apparently there are felonies
that are not criminal. So, uh,
let's just go back to civil
immigration law. So, um, that
one is what the, what we're
talking about here are things
like um overstaying a visa,
failing to maintain a legal
status, um, being unlawfully
present, um, and those sorts of
civil penalties.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
so.
Is it
Is it not a felony or not a
misdemeanor.
And that I will definitely ask
you your question about the
felonies that are not criminal
because that's quite
interesting. But Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, when it comes to
the civil
It was my understanding that
it's still a crime, is it not,
is it not correct to say that
it's a crime to enter the
country illegally, not through a
port of entry.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, in
some cases it is a misdemeanor
and in some cases it is a civil
violation.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
when it comes to the
misdemeanor, we would be able to
give out the information, just
not.
Only a civil penalty, correct?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um, I
think what is pertinent about
this bill is that it is there
are felony criminal provisions
of that um federal immigration
and Nationality Act, which could
include things like um
kidnapping, um, human
trafficking, um, those sorts of
provisions are the ones that um
that that are accepted Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, nothing
in this um act prevents or ties
the hands of law enforcement to
continue working, um, it is not.
the state's job to enforce
federal immigration law. That is
the federal government's job and
us as a state we are within our
right to define what those
parameters are, which is what
this bill does for the MBD data
specifically.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle ladies, so we're
specifically talking about the
MVD data, but is there any other
data that we would be precluded
from giving out regarding that
immigration status if the person
did have a a civil penalty.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, yes,
the second part of this bill is
specifically focused on the MBD
data.
All right. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, so then
any kind of other record that
would be, let's just say with
DPS or state police, for
example, that would still be
allowed to be given out
regardless of.
The status of the offense, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, yes,
because, um, essentially what
happens with our uh data from
MBD is it goes into the New
Mexico Interactive um database
and then that is where we kind
of organize our data and send it
out to different state agencies,
so, um, it would not preclude
them from sending that data for
to the New Mexico Department of
Public Safety, for instance.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
General Liddy, and then can you
tell me when it, when it comes
to MVD how many individual
records would this pertain to?
How many individuals are we
going to be shielding from
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
this is all the MBD records, so,
you know, about 1.5 million.
OK, Mr. Speaker, generally, so
1.5 million records would just
not be allowed to be given in
any way to, wait there's not 1.5
million illegal aliens or no,
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, 1.5,
there are 1.5 million about
driver's license holders in New
Mexico, so that is the data that
the MBD holds in their database.
All right, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, but of those records, the
1.5, how many of them would be
shielded shielded is what I'm
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, this
includes all the records, all
that this bill says is that in
I'll point you on page 7,
subsection C is that whenever
the MBD, the department or the
division enters into a contract
with a non-governmental entity
for the disclosure of personal
information that they must
certify in writing that they're
not going to be using that
information, um, disclosing it,
um, for the purposes of
enforcing the federal
immigration Nationality Act,
except for those felony.
provisions of that act.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
I am not.
A lawyer, but I do read a lot of
laws, right? So, Mr. Speaker,
General Liddy, I know under 8
USC 1325, section 1325. It does
have improper entry by alien is
what it's called in federal law
and then it says one of them is
entering or attempting to enter
the US improperly and I believe
Mr. Speaker, generally, this is.
Winning, it is an alien, and
these are the words of the
federal government enters or
tries to enter the US at any
time or place other than those
designated by immigration
officers such as outside
official ports of entry. So Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, would that
is that is that included in this
since it is a misdemeanor or a
felony in that case.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
it's a misdemeanor, so no.
OK, Mr. Speaker, generally, so
we would not be giving out that
information or it would be
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, this
is, uh, as there are certainly
some exceptions that we have in
this bill, um, if you have this.
What this bill does is currently
um there are different ways for
non-governmental entities,
private data brokers to access
this information without a
warrant, without a subpoena, so
if you did have a warrant or a
subpoena, then yes, you could
access that information.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
but I, I don't believe that
there are a bunch of NGOs that
are just feeding information to
the federal government, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, so is this
trying to protect people from
being.
Touched by NGOs or is it mainly
about interacting with the
federal government as I'm
reading here, it says in
contract with the
non-governmental entity or
disclose a personal information.
So, like if, if let's just say
the Department of Homeland
Security requested this
information. Would they still be
allowed to get all that
information.
Since it's not an NGO, it's a
government.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, they
would have to certify that
they're not using it for the
purposes of as defined in this
act.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies,
so if they requested information
saying we are looking for a
felony convicted individual who
is not properly in this country
legally.
And they have a felony offense
and they asked for a list of all
the individuals' names who had
felony offenses, Mister Speaker,
Generalla that individual's name
would be given out, not with
this bill.peer and gentlemen,
totally.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
generally, but if it was a
misdemeanor offense. It was
something that was not a felony
in its own right, then we would
not be giving that out. Is that
the way I understand it? Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, they
would have to certify or have a
warrant or a subpoena.
OK, Mr. Speaker, General Lee,
so.
I know just a couple weeks ago,
maybe last week, they had a
bunch of different, they carried
out these
Uh, operations to target
specifically people who did have
these felony offenses, people
who were dangerous, who had
previous convictions, things
like evasion or arrest, uh, from
Stealing something, trafficking,
etc. So Mr. Speaker, generally,
I just want to be super crystal
clear, so we will be allowed to
give information out to somebody
who
Is
Just here undocumented, not
legal in the country.
And that's the only offense if
they have additional offenses
that is not requested or that is
not.
Uh, required, is that correct?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, yes,
if they were going through a
criminal investigation process
and they were investigating
someone for a felony criminal
provision or any such just as
they are doing now, they would
still be able to access that.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
General Lady, and then would
this also pertain to, would this
be giving sanctuary, so to
speak, to whistleblowers as
well, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
this is not a sanctuary bill.
Uh, however, uh, I will say that
they're within the first section
of the bill, not in the MVD
section, but in the first
section which standardizes
procedures across the state, um.
These, there are exceptions made
pursuant to the whistleblower
Protection Act.
Got it. OK, thank you, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, but so
Can I, can I ask you why we're
trying to exempt this from
people who have misdemeanors,
since it is indeed a criminal
offense, uh, a misdemeanor to be
in the country legally according
to USC.
Section Title 8 USC Section
1325, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
I'm wondering why is it that
we're trying to hold back these
individuals who are indeed
criminals pursuant to the US
federal law. Why are we trying
to not give access to these
individuals who are indeed
criminals pursuant to federal
law.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, as
I've said, um, if there's a
criminal investigation, there's
a felony, um, pursuant to this
law, they are still able to
access this information. Nothing
precludes getting a warrant or
anything like that, a subpoena
to to get this information, but
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, I'll
say the reason why we are
bringing this bill is that there
are a lot of immigrant New
Mexicans they approached the MVD
in good faith. They are pro or
the uh an agency they're
providing uh.
Um, there's to, to in order to
get a standard driver's license,
they're disclosing their
information, a photo, their
address, their identifying
information there, uh,
individual tax in identification
registering their vehicles
getting insurance, becoming part
of one of the most useful data
systems available currently to
law enforcement and we want to
ensure that everyone continues
to use this uh data system.
This is for the uh for public
safety.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. Well, I believe I totally
agree with public safety, but I
also believe, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, if somebody did
break a law.
And the state now says no, not
really. It's not that bad of a
law, right? And I mean, that's
the way I kind of hear it. So
they're like, oh, it could be
worse. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, I'm just wondering.
Why do we have to wait until
that person does commit a felony
to give out that information.
Because right now, if they have
a misdemeanor, we just said that
they're not allowed to give out
information. So we're kind of
waiting until they have a felony
conviction to give that out,
right?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
it is within our state right to
make this policy decision, uh,
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, if
this body feels that it is a
good policy decision that we
continue to have folks in our
immigrant community come
forward, um, on crimes to
continue to register themselves
into our system and continue to
create um for for our for our
law enforcement system here, the
most useful data systems that
currently are available, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, it would
be good policy.
that we adopt this um data
privacy um.
Bill.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, OK, so
if we're talking about good
policy, I would like to just go
to page 8 then of the bill which
says any person who violates the
provisions of this sections
guilty of a misdemeanor and upon
conviction shall be sentenced
according to the provisions of
Section 31-19-1. So Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
The would we be suing the
governmental entity that is
requesting the information if it
is used for immigration
purposes, or would it be if they
use that in a different way than
they asked for it. How, how are
we going to go after the federal
government as the state.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
this provision doesn't apply to
the federal government, it
applies to um the MBD and the
data broker and um what our
state agencies have asked is
that we come forward to
standardize um to help
standardize this policy across
not just by county or by city
but throughout the whole state.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
I do see on GSD's.
Analysis they project a
liability of up to 200,000 in 3
years, and I'm just wondering
how this state budget
anticipates this legal defense
cost under this bill. How are we
going to eat that?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, that's
if they violate the law, as we,
um, as we anticipate there will
be extensive training on how to
implement this law, uh, so that
it, it's not broken, Mr. Speaker
and gentlemen, and I'll just say
that, you know, um, if you've
ever been in government
contracting, um, when I worked
at the city of Albuquerque, I
did many, many contracts, um.
For a different homelessness
providers and always in the
contract you have provisions and
what this is defining is that on
page 7 before you're entering
into a contract with the
non-governmental entity that you
would um certify that the entity
you're entering into contracts
certifies in writing that um
they in accessing this
information that they'll treat
it, uh, respectfully that they
will treat it carefully and that
it's the personal information of
folks, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, so, um, in my
training when I was learning how
to do these contracts, uh, that.
there was a list of all the
things that we needed to have in
the contract, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, that would be the
standard practice I'm sure also
for state contracting.
All right, so Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, so this provision
is based upon the actual
individual working for the
state. So if the person gave out
the information, maybe it was
unknowingly gave out the
information.
What if they didn't know, uh, is
there any kind of provision that
protects that employee because I
mean these are state employees
and I don't want to be putting
targets on state employees'
backs they made a mistake. So
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, does
it require, where does it say
intentional in the bill.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
the penalty is for intention
and, uh, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, in the first section
of the bill for all our state
agencies you'll see on page 2
line.
know
14, uh, I have amendments in
context so I don't have the, the
numbers here maybe it's like 19
or 22, um, a state agency
employees shall not
intentionally disclose sensitive
information, um, acquired by
virtue of the employee's
position.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. Is that only pertaining to
the, the information we were, we
talked about earlier when it
comes to that personal
information like sexual
orientation and gender identity,
and I think we also had
religion, tax status, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, what does
that include in that provision,
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, yes,
it refers exactly to um the
sensitive personal information,
um, as provided in that in that
the way it's written the state
agency employees shall not
intentionally disclose sensitive
personal information.
And as we've reviewed sens
sensitive personal information
does include national origin. It
includes your religion. It
includes your medical
conditions. It includes your
physical and mental disability,
um, something that, you know,
might be very personal to you
that you wouldn't want just
anyone um to know and uh the
purpose really of this bill is
that there are currently uh
private companies who are coming
into possession, anyone who can
pay essentially the MVD is
selling this um data too we
wanna ensure that our state
agencies are
uniform and uh we are protecting
the information of vulnerable
New Mexicans.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. I'm wondering how would a
state agency know what someone's
religion is. How would that, how
do they get that information?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, if
it's provided, if they have it.
OK, Mr. Speak discloses it, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen. All right, I
just don't understand, Mr.
Speaker, General Lady, any
individual institution of our
state, asking for such
information. Like what, what's
your religion? I, I just have
never seen that on a form. So
I'm just wondering if that's
even, is that a problem in the
state? Can you tell me? Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen,
certainly.
For instance, if you're um of a
certain religion, there's
certain restrictions for blood
transfusion, um, and so Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, that
information might be provided,
um.
Inadvertently uh during an
interview process for our, we
have social workers in our
state, um, when they're
interviewing, they write certain
things down, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, this, this
information can be acquired in
many ways, um, but you know it's
not necessarily on a checklist,
for instance, that we're
gathering if you're applying for
Medicaid, for instance.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle ladies,
so then I, I, I'm trying to
understand how the bill works
because I see in this provision
on page 2, it has under 2 under
A.
Sexual orientation, gender
identity, physical or mental
disability, medical condition,
and then it says immigration
status. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady.
The information for the
individual, we're not giving out
any information the way I read
it regarding immigration status,
even if they have a felony
conviction because that is
precluded on this first section.
So would it be any and all
individuals who are here
undocumented, not legally in the
country, are we not allowed to
give that information out, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, unless
they certify it, when, when, if
they certify, yes.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
how did they certify?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, uh,
I'll point you to the exceptions
that are provided, so it's, it's
not never, uh, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, as you'll see.
Where a necessary to carry out a
function of the state agency be
necessary to comply with an
order or subpoena issued by a
court, um.
Inspection of public records,
there are the whistleblower
Protection Act as we've
discussed the HIPAA um Act of
1996.
Or with written consent, someone
could consent.
Mr. Speaker, General Lady, but
on page two it says D.
Required by federal statute and
currently federal statute says
that these people are here in
the country illegally under USC
Title 8 USC Section 1325. So I'm
just wondering,
So with that,
Trump, so to speak.
With that trump the state law,
if it's a federal infraction.
Speaker and gentlemen, the
federal statute, uh, that you're
talking about, I believe, if you
could specify which one, it does
not.
Require you to disclose personal
sensitive information.
Sure, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
so it's, it's under Title 8.
I, I need to find the actual
statute here. Let me find it,
but it does say these
individuals like, like we are
compelled to assist the federal
government when this person is
breaking the law. So Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I'm just,
I'm, I'm trying to figure out
what is breaking the law enough
to
Compel this information because
if, if it's a court order.
Then the court has ordered it,
that would be the federal law
that we would be following,
correct?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen.
be
The federal statute that you're
talking about does not require
that you disclose sensitive
personal information.
And if it did, it would be part
of this statute.
It would be part of these
exceptions.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and I've been
reading through it and I just
wanna make sure that we're all
totally clear. So when it comes
to the bill itself, we're saying
that.
As required by federal statute
that is very vague, so I get,
I'm sure there's a million
statutes that we could find and
weasel our way out of this to
say, OK, well, you must assist
us to get this information
because this person is a threat.
And so when that person's a
threat, I believe that is in
federal law. So Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, what, what do we
have to prove on the state level
to, to clap back at that, so to
speak.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
so to speak, um.
That would, I mean, the easiest
way to, to comply with that
would be to get a subpoena if
you're in the process of a
criminal investigation, for
instance.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
because I see here in 8 USC 1373
section 642.
Of the illegal immigration
reform and immigration
responsibility Act of 1996. It's
mandates that states and local
government entities and
officials cannot prohibit or
restrict the sharing of
information with federal
immigration authorities
specifically the immigration and
Naturalization Service now US
Immigration and Customs
Enforcement, so that is in
federal law. So Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, do we have any
concerns with that conflicting
with that statute that is 8 USC.
Section 1373, and then it's
under section 642.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
Let's get into the law. We are
not violating federal law. We do
not have that concern by
implementing this statute
because it is a matter of
states' rights. So we're
deciding how we want to handle
New Mexican um data and how we
want to control our state
agencies.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. Well, I do see that it, in
my opinion, it conflicts with
it, and I'm not an attorney and
I neither of us are, but I do
wanna make sure that we are
indeed following federal laws
when it comes to these
individuals because I don't see
the point of shielding certain
people from scrutiny when they
are indeed in the country, not
legally and that is indeed a
infraction on the federal level.
So, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
are is there any other in
that we're also including in
this any other people would be
able to not release that
information. If it's not
relating to federal immigration,
uh.
Infractions, like we said
felonies, I mean, what other
misdemeanors are we allowing
now? Is it all misdemeanors or
is it just what's under 8 USC
Section 1373 or whatever that
that is I just read.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, this
bill does not allow
misdemeanors. This bill is about
the personal sensitive data of
folks and how our state
agencies um should handle them.
That's the guidance we're
putting parameters around the
way that we want this data to go
out how we contract with other
in the second part how we
contract with the MVD, um, how
the MVD contracts with other
folks, private entities who are
um collecting this data and
distributing it to people who
can pay for it or whoever should
be interested in it.
OK, thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. So, OK, we're
targeting third parties. We're
not targeting the government, so
we're saying anything that the
government requests we're giving
it to them? Yes, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, if they have a
subpoena and are investigating a
criminal procedure definitely
they can still access the
information, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, if they have
certified, at least for the MBD
on the MBD side, if they have
certified, um, that you know
they're not gonna be you that
they're gonna be using this
information, um.
Respectfully and responsibly,
uh, Mr. Speaker and, and
gentlemen and in the first half
of the bill um for our state
agencies we have a numerous list
of different exceptions
included, which is if you get a
subpoena uh issued by a court.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, so
I, I guess I, I'm, I'm going
back to the whole criminal
versus civil. So criminal
We've, we've already established
it's a crime, it's criminal to
be in the country illegally
under 8 USC. So Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
Would those individuals, even if
they didn't have an additional
felony, be excluded from this
because it is indeed a crime
federally and I believe it is a
misdemeanor, so I'm just
wondering how are we defining
civil versus criminal here
because the civil case is
something that, that a person
files against another person.
This is the federal government
versus an individual. So how are
we defining that?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, as
defined in the law of what this
provision does is it does
specify that if it is a felony
criminal provision of that act
that it can be disclosed.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
but if it's just immigration
status, let's just say you're
here not legally.
And they're looking for people
who are here, not legally.
That's a federal offense.
That information cannot be given
out. Is that what I'm
understanding? If it's without
a, without a subpoena and
everything, correct?
Correct, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen.
OK, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
and then do we know how many
other states have put forward
this kind of provision in the
law.
How many other states are doing
similar things like this.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
other states certainly have
them. What we're trying to do is
very New Mexico specific, um,
specific to our state to our
needs, and defining what we need
for our communities in this case
it is uh in this case is a
policy decision to say there's
certain personal sensitive
information, sensitive
information like your Social
Security number like your
religion, like your sexual
orientation that shouldn't just
be given out, um, without your
written consent.
um, without some kind of
warrant, without some kind of
necessary um reason for um if if
the state agency, for instance,
needs it to comply to carry out
their function, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, we're defining this
for ourselves.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and, and I agree with
that. I totally agree with that.
I think that provision is good,
specifically when it comes to
the personal information,
religion, sexual orientation,
uh, race, etc. I, I agree with
that. I don't think that we
should be able to sell that
data.
But Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
when it comes to the immigration
status and the individual who
the federal government is trying
to find because they may be in
the country illegally, how are
we conflating that with, with
public safety because in my
opinion, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, if we are looking at a
public safety perspective, yes,
the information regarding sexual
orientation, gender identity,
things like that are not public
safety, but immigration status,
that's a, that's a law broken.
That's, that's.
different. How are we how are we
balancing the two, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady? Speaker and
gentlemen, we need all New
Mexicans to feel safe to come
forward about.
Crimes that they've seen, for
instance, we need our New
Mexicans to be able to uh
register at the MVD to feel uh
safe and secure to be part of
this data system that our law
enforcement, our state law
enforcement uses, um, we would
not want folks to uh not feel
comfortable to, to put that
their information into these
data systems. We need these data
systems, um, so Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, as I've said before,
if for instance the federal
government wants to
What think someone is here um in
this country uh without
documentation and um they get a
warrant and they get a subpoena.
Issued by a court of the state,
then they can still access this
information. Nothing ties the
hands of law enforcement here.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, but
oh, it does, because we would
have to go to the court and get
a subpoena instead of just
requesting it. Isn't that
correct, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
yes, following the process of
law, Mr. Speaker, lady, but also
potentially creating a lag time
in apprehending an individual
because we would take time to
find that individual because
we'd have to file a subpoena,
we'd have to get that, and then
we need to go to the department
and then once the department has
the MVD give the information,
who knows how much time has
passed between the first time to
the now. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, I'm just wondering how we
reconcile that when it comes to
a public safety angle, which is
the way we're trying to sell
this bill. How is that public
safety if it's taking longer
for, for police officers to do
their job.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, has
said, if they are investigating
a crime, they will be able to
still access this database if it
is uh the MVD specifically if it
is a felony criminal provision
of that act, they will still be
able to access it.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, but
the crime is being in the
country illegally. So if they're
investigating that, would we be
allowing that then if the person
if the crime is being here
illegally, not going through a
port of entry and coming a
different way that is not
legally allowed.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, can
you rephrase your question?
OK, you said if they're
investigating a crime, they'd be
allowed to access it. The crime
is being here illegally in the
country, so they would be able
to access it, correct?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, I am
learning about this, um, about
immigration law and ours as I
said before.
It is not the state's job to
enforce federal immigration law
or federal misdemeanors unless
our law enforcement officers
observe it themselves, so Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, this
would proceed in the same way
any crime would.
You were still able to access
the information.
For a criminal investigation.
OK. Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady. So I'm looking at
the DA's analysis and the DA's
analysis mentions federal law
and it cites the case City of
Albuquerque versus Bar.
And in that case, Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, they note that it
says that the state or local
government may not prohibit or
restrict its own officials from
communicating information
regarding the citizenship or
immigration status of any
individual.
So, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
I'm wondering, does this violate
that.
That, uh, case law then because
that case in the state did
indeed say that, so Mister
Speaker, gentle lady, I'm just,
I'm very confused. Can you help
me with that?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
I, I would certainly encourage
the full reading of the case,
um, to the final, final opinion
that case from 2021, um.
Required state and local
jurisdictions to comply with
special conditions and adhere to
that was trying to acquire um
require the state and local
jurisdictions to comply with
special conditions and the law
that you stated earlier, 1373,
but Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
the decision on that was that
the DOJ was enjoined from
requiring compliance in order to
release the federal grants to
the city of Albuquerque. There's
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, many
other cases, um, that talk about
13.
73 from uh Murphy versus Double
NCA Philadelphia v. Sessions,
City of Chicago v. Sessions, um,
in 7th Court circuits in eastern
districts in many different
higher level courts and Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, what they
have said is that um 171373 is
unconstitutional because it is
part of the it violates the
anti-commandeering doctrine
which gives our states the
rights to re
ate ourselves.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, but what about the
supremacy clause because.
This could invite federal legal
challenges based upon that,
particularly given the US DOJ's
success in blocking similar
statutes in other states. So Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, how does
that work?
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen.
The supremacy clauses talk about
laws, not actions, and Mr.
Speaker and, and, um, gentlemen,
what we see here is that um the
the the courts cannot, the
courts have ruled that the
states, our states we have
rights and our rights include
the ability to um to prohibit
and restrict actions, actions by
our own subdivisions.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I
agree with that, but I also see
that there's also other case law
we cited Sessions v. City of
Chicago and other places like
that, but Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, there's also
Different
cases across the entire country,
and I'm trying to focus mainly
on the state of New Mexico
because this is what's we have a
different constitution than the
state of Illinois. We have a
different constitution in Texas,
etc. So, Mr. Speaker, General
Liddy, I'm just trying to figure
out.
Are there any cases in the city
of New Mexico that have
successfully blocked.
us from giving out information
that we're not sent to another
circuit for an appeal.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
there are certainly are
specifics that you're asking for
here that don't exist in uh our
state law because we are a
smaller states, so there are
fewer cases as I've learned, um,
trying to write briefs with only
7 cases on a specific issue, but
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, we do
have local case law here in the
case of City v. Albuquerque, um,
that is our very own case where
we said that you know that the
DOJ wasn't.
Joined from requiring compliance
to those to the to um to 1373
and it was ordered to release a
federal grants. In addition, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, I'll I'll
remind the body that many other
jurisdictions in our state
already have these kind of
restrictions for personal
sensitive data, um, and so far.
You know, those have not been
challenged, Mr. Speaker, and,
um, and gentlemen, those
jurisdictions are like Las
Cruces, Santa Fe, San Miguel
County, Bernlio County,
Albuquerque, those policies have
been on the books since 2017,
um, and they haven't been
challenged by the federal
government and continue to
receive federal money, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, again
what this law, this law does not
prohibit law enforcement from
coming in federal law
enforcement even from coming.
with a warrant and saying these
are some specific folks that uh
we would like to know some
information on because we're
investigating a crime, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, what this
does is protect our sensitive
data put parameters around it
for how we want our agencies to
handle that data.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady. Well, that's my whole
concern, because, yeah, they may
be getting federal dollars
today, but we see in other
states, we see the city of
Boston, we see across the states
there's the state of Maine.
Other places are not receiving
federal dollars because they are
indeed putting forward laws like
this that do indeed preclude
them from doing their job and
thus yanking billions in federal
dollars. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, that is my concern because
I like New Mexico.
But New Mexico is very heavily
dependent on the federal
government when it comes to our
state, if we pass this, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, my concern
is, yeah, these, these sanctuary
cities, the sanctuary counties
like Dona Anna County,
Bernalillo County, Santa Fe, uh,
city of Albuquerque, they could
lose these federal dollars. So
Mr. Speaker, General lady, does
this have in any way a provision
that says if the federal
government decides to yank
billions of dollars away from
us, then this is null and void
for that county, that specific
uh MB.
that's located in Albuquerque,
for example.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, um,
we can't legislate on fear, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, uh, what
this provision is doing it, it's
still allows the federal
government, um, as I've said
before, to come in if they need
to um to investigate a crime if
there's a felony for immigration
purposes of the immigration Act,
uh, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
it, it, it does not restrict it
in that way, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, this is about our,
our sensitive data and as we've
seen in um the case law around.
the country and in our state
here, uh, this is, it's within
our, our right, um, for our
anti-commandeering doctrine for
us to put in place laws like
this lady,
well, I don't think we should be
legislating in fear, but we
shouldn't be legislating.
In a way that could jeopardize
the future of our state.
Because Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, dollars are tied to
everything federally in the
state of New Mexico everything
from education to healthcare to.
Paving roads and infrastructure.
So Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, I
think it's very proper and wise
for us not to try to pick a
fight with the federal
government with a bill like this
because Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, from my understanding, uh,
that California had Senate bill
54, and many of its provisions
that are similar to this were
struck down.
Under the rationale that they
were invalid due to federal
preemption grounds, so Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, do we
think that this can uphold
constitutional muster.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, yes.
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, on
what basis?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, based
on all the court cases, the 10th
Amendment, the
anti-commandeering doctrine
based on our own city of
Albuquerque, um, judgment that
was here where there was uh
withholding of of um federal
grants and actually the DOJ um
wasn't joined from requiring
compliance in order to release
the federal grants to the city
of Albuquerque. Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, and then there's also
other cases like in Los Angeles,
city of Los Angeles versus Bar
2020. I see other cases in New
Mexico the US where they've
limited state powers when they
undermine federal law
enforcement. That's in the state
of New Mexico. So Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, I feel like we're
just like kind of going back and
forth on this when it comes to
this circular reasoning, but Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, I do find
it.
Maybe I'm not fearful that we're
gonna lose federal dollars, I'm
certain that we're going to lose
federal dollars and when this
does indeed go into law, if it
does, which I hope it doesn't,
Mr. Speaker, gentle lady, this
state will lose money, and the
state will deserve what it gets
because we have poked the bear.
We went too far, and when we're
not complying with federal laws,
federal statutes, and we're
pretty much trying to pick a
fight.
I don't think that's wise
because Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, I wouldn't go picking a
fight with the former president.
I wouldn't go picking a fight
with the current president. I
think it's important that we as
a state don't legislate to help
people who have broken laws like
coming into the country
illegally, I would rather uphold
the constitutional laws that we
do have that have been shown to
be constitutional and not follow
things like California's SB 54
or follow Los Angeles's
sanctuary statute. So Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady.
Do you, can you give me with a
100% certainty that this will
not lose us federal dollars
after we pass this bill.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, I'll
point you to the case of City of
Albuquerque versus Barr in 2021
and
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, do
you know who the president was
in 2017 and 2018. Mr. Speaker,
that was our great president
Donald John Trump.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, that
is correct, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, who was his vice
president?
I don't use that individual's
name, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
but I do believe when it comes
to that, that lower level case,
city of Albuquerque. I don't
believe that went to a US
Federal Circuit, did it?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, if
you want to talk a circuit, we
can talk the 7th Circuit City of
Chicago v. Sessions, Mr. Speaker
and gentlemen. Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady, and we can
definitely go back to
California, where the US Supreme
Court enjoined that one.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, the
California cases, do you know,
uh, if those cases were on laws
or were they on actions, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen.
Speaker was on laws actually.
Great, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, because this law
deals with actions, Mr. Speaker
and gentlemen, and that's why we
are not being seen here, um, to
be in some kind of violation,
um, and Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, which is why we have
the ability to regulate the
actions of our state agencies to
regulate the
sensitive personal information,
how it's distributed, where it's
distributed, um, under what
circumstances it's distributed
and as I've said before and Mr.
Speaker, I will certainly say
again this law does not
prohibit um or force the federal
government from not being able
to.
To um enforce federal
immigration policy, Mr. Speaker
and gentlemen, getting a warrant
or subpoena, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, um, if they're
investigating, you know, the
highest form, the felonies, you
know, uh, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen.
The, the felony crimes of
trafficking, human trafficking,
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, we
are still allowed to, um,
they're still allowed to access
that information.
And as we just said, you said
it's about actions versus
Laws and then you, you went to
go cite a law in the state of
California and you cited our law
that we would pass with this
bill. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, it is absolutely a concern
and it's something that we do
need to in completely focus on
because this law could indeed
violate federal laws under title
under Section 8. So Mr. Speaker,
gentle lady.
I'm trying to get back to the
core of what we're trying to
focus on, and that is protecting
our citizens.
From losing billions and
billions of dollars in federal
money, and there is indeed cases
at the Supreme Court level that
do show that they've stricken
down these kinds of cases. So
when it comes to the actual
dollars.
I'm, I'm just wondering, is
there any kind of
Protection for us when it comes
to those dollars, do we, do we
have billions of dollars to
protect us from the other
dollars that we will lose after
this bill's it's passed and
signed into law.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
I'd love to know what Supreme
Court cases those are, um,
Westlaw doesn't have them in my
opinion, Mr. Speaker and
gentlemen, um, but Mr. Speaker
and gentlemen, um,
You know, this, this law does
keep us safer because it ensures
that our immigrant community can
feel safe and secure in bringing
forward their personal
information for registering for
a driver's license following the
laws of our state, uh, getting,
uh,
Insurance for their car and
driving on, on the streets, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, our MPD
database is one of the best
tools that our state law
enforcement has. We want to
ensure that we are continuing to
protect that by ensuring that
important and personal
information is protected.
And Mr. Speaker, General, I
think we both
Kind of agreed on that. I think
the personal information we do
want to protect, but when it
comes to the immigration
portion, I think that that's
where we have a little bit of a
problem when it comes to our
viewpoints on this. So Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, when it
comes to these actual crimes,
many of these immigration cases
are indeed tied to other crimes.
So it is not just entering the
country illegally. It's also
something as well as that, like.
Peddling a substance that's
controlled substance, for
example, and it couldn't, it's
maybe it's not trafficking,
maybe it's just a few grams, for
example, it's not trafficking.
So, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
how are we going to define that?
Can you just show me in the bill
what page where we define what
specific criminal elements we
are not going to say we're not
going to hold this back, we can
give that to you. What specific
criminal elements are we going
to allow giving that out without
subpoenas, warrants, criminal
proceedings, or court
proceedings.
Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, it is the
immigration and Nationality Act.
Can you go to a page for me, Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady on there.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, it is
a very, very, very long act. I
was not even able to download it
because it was in multiple tabs
on the website, uh, but Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, give me a
second, Mr. Speaker, I'm just
talking about your bill, which
page do we reference it in your
bill, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
I'm sorry, this is not a very,
very long act, page 8.
OK. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I
was just trying to find that.
So, yeah, I was not gonna tell
you to read me like case law
from or, you know, regulation
from the federal government,
which is very hard to find and
very interesting to read and
very legalese. So Mr. Speaker.
gentle lady, I do think that
there are some, there's a lot of
different cases that we could
talk about a bunch of them that
actually had the Supreme Court
sent it back to the lower
circuit, which it did in join
certain provisions in the
California case. That's where
that Supreme Court case was and
then Mr. Speaker, General Lady,
I do want to make sure that
we're all understanding that.
Like, although we want to
protect people in our
communities, we don't want to
protect people who've broken
laws, and I guess that's kind of
the way I see it when it comes
to this bill. I don't want to be
protecting people who've broken
laws, and I also don't want to
be.
Losing federal dollars for us
because we need those for things
that are important like keeping
lights on and
became educators and things like
that. So Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, I do think that that is
something that is a concern of
many New Mexicans and.
I hope and I pray that we don't
lose these dollars, but when we
do, which I'm sure will happen
despite our prayers and our
wishes, I just don't want to be
here saying that I was one of
the people who let this happen.
So, Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
that's pretty much all the
questions I had on this bill. I
can't support it because it's
super broad, but I do like some
of the portions, maybe if this
doesn't pass, which hopefully
doesn't pass, then we can work
together on protecting some of
that personal information like
sexual orientation data, things
like religion and race, because
I think we can all agree on
that. However,
When it comes to the immigration
portion, I don't want to be
destigmatizing crime. I think
crime is something that should
be stigmatized and something
that needs to be gone after. So
thank you, Mr. Speaker, thank
you gentle lady, and appreciate
the debate. Thank you. There is
further debate, gentlemen from
San Juan, Representative Duncan.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will my
friend yield?
I yield to my friend from San
Juan.
Thank you Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady. I'd like to remind this
body that we've passed a few
bills out of fear this session.
So just to, just to let you
know.
Um, a couple of questions for
you, um, can you, um,
Can you give me a few examples
of what a federal misdemeanor
is.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
in which body of law in our
state law or in the INA?
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady
Federal.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
if it's specific to the INA, um,
which is what this bill
specifies the uh immigration and
Nationality Act, it would be
something like overseeing a
visa.
Being unlawfully present.
Failing to maintain legal
status, it's um really uh laws
that regulate immigration status
residency, um, without involving
criminal penalties.
Thank you Mr. Speaker and uh
gentle lady, um, I think this
body is so misaligned where the
people of the state of New
Mexico are at.
When we align ourselves with
California and Illinois.
And go against um an alignance
of them. Let me just put it that
way. I think we are misaligned
with the state of folks that
live in the state of New Mexico.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, if
I walked into um Canada if I
walked into Russia, if I walked
into Mexico.
And I didn't do it properly.
Would they have afforded me the
same courtesy that uh we're
doing with this bill, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, I'm not
sure about those, um,
countries's laws.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
they would not.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady. for the debate,
gentle lady from Chavez,
Representative Mejia.
Mr. thank you Mr. Speaker does
the gentle lady from Bernalillo
Yield I yield.
Thank you. I have a few
questions regarding the real ID
Act.
Um
That set standards for the
issuance of driver's license and
identification cards aiming to
enhance security and
How real ID policy and
requiresment relate to
immigration information, um.
Can you tell me what's required
for the real ID.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
gentle lady, could you explain
how this pertains to this
particular bill.
Uh, yes, it's regarding the MVD
and the information that is
required to get a real ID.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, um,
as I understand New Mexico does
have two driver's licenses, a
real ID is an option, um, I
personally don't have a real ID
because I have a passport, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, but
many, many New Mexicans, um,
have a just standard license,
um, many, so Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, the data that we're
trying to, um, the personal
information that we're trying to
put parameters around, um, would
be.
all the data that's in MBD.
OK, um, you know, the real ID
requires states to share
information with federal
agencies to verify the
authenticity of documents and
the identity of applicants.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
yes, and the state will continue
to be able to do that with the
real ID, um, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, when an individual
goes to the MBD it's my
understanding um that you can
choose between a standard
license or real ID would you say
that that is your experience,
um, gentle lady and Mr. Speaker.
Uh, yes, ma'am, and, um.
How does the real ID.
Act ensures that the legal
status of applicants is
accurately verified.
Uh, Mr. Speaker and gentle lady
again you know you're able to
choose between the real ID and
the standard license here in our
state, Mr. Speaker and gentle
ladies, so nothing um nothing in
this bill would say that um
would affect the real ID
process, you would still be able
to apply in the federal
government would still be able
to verify for your real ID.
OK, thank you for those answers.
I have no further questions.
See no further debate generally
close.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, and, um, and
body.
Thank you for the uh really
great debate, uh, Mr. Speaker,
and dental.
It's just Mr. Speaker, um, I now
move that, uh, Senate Bill 36 do
not pass.
As amended.
We are on final passage of
Senate Bill 36 is twice amended.
The vote is now open.
The vote is about.
To close.
The vote is not closed by a vote
of 41 in the affirmative, 23.
Gentle lady, how do you wish to
vote?
The border is not closed by a
vote of 40.
2 in the affirmative.
Cheesy yes vote of 42 in the
affirmative, 23 in the negative.
Senate Bill 36 recommended has
really pass this house.
Gentlemen from Chavez,
Representative Murphy, are you
ready on item number 51.
Yes, Mr. Speaker, could you get
me to that point?
necessary for placing Senate
Bill 280 on final passage that's
been taken and it is not subject
to debate. Amendment or
substitution, gentlemen, to
explain the bill.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, um, I
have an expert witness coming,
former Representative Candy Zel.
Now Senator Candy Zi.
Um, Mr. Speaker, uh, SB 280, um.
would allow the Mexican military
institute.
To be eligible for funding under
the school improvement
replacement project through the
public school Capitol Outlay
Council.
And with that, I stand for
questions gentlemen close.
Mr. Speaker, I would move the SB
280, uh, receive a due pass
final passage of Senate Bill
280. The vote is not open.
The vote is about to close.
The vote is not closed by a vote
of 65 in the affirmative, 0, in
the negative. Senate Bill 280 as
Duly pass his house. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker and the Mexican
military is a true gem and I
appreciate the support of the,
of the, uh, chamber.
A
You, you yield it when you move
to do pass, but.
Let it go.
The lady from Vernon Leo
represented Thompson.
Are you ready on item 53?
I am, Mr. Speaker. Can you get
me to that point a necessary
place in Senate Judiciary
Committee substitute for Senate
Bill 219 as amended on final
passage has been taken and it is
not subject to debate amendment
or substitution, the gentle lady
to explain the bill. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker. So Senate Bill 219
is the medical psilocybin Act,
it establishes a regulated
framework for medical psilocybin
and silicin use in New Mexico
and creates a fund to assist low
income patients.
And support research it won't
start until December 31st, 2027
to give DOH time to make rules
of the administration of the
program, and I would like to
yield to my co-sponsor the
gentle lady from Torrance and
Bernardo.
Thank you, gentle lady, uh, I am
one of the co-sponsors that is
on this bill, um, interesting
story how this started, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, we were
in a committee some years ago
and they had brought up
something about medical suicide
and and having my degree in
psychology with the emphasis in
neuropsychology is very familiar
with how well this works with
PTSD, OCD, um, drug addiction,
um.
Uh, depression, PTSD, there's
many different ways that this
medication will help people and
it is not something that is
going to get out into the
streets it's gonna be something
that's been a very controlled,
um.
very controlled way and they'll
be working with therapists and
I'm very excited to see this
move forward because there's so
much research in case people
don't know there's a bunch of
research in the VA and there's
research at Johns Hopkins, so
I'm very happy to support this
bill. Thank you.
And Mr. Speaker, I would like to
yield to my co-sponsor from
Santa Fe.
A lady from San thank you Mr.
Speaker. Thank you, gentle lady.
Um, this is puts New Mexico on
the map as essentially one of
the first and best in care when
it comes to PTSD, anxiety, and
really at the cutting edge of
all of the opportunities that we
have to treat some of the most
difficult long term, um,
Interests that we see within our
veterans communities with those
who have carried, um, everything
from trauma to great tragedy.
This is an incredible
opportunity for us that puts us
in on the map as one of the
greatest sort of medical
opportunities that we have for
the people of New Mexico. Love
the bipartisan effort, love the
focus of this bill for what it
is that we're trying to do to
help serve those in need and
with that, madam, uh, Mr.
Speaker, I will yield back. And
Mr. Speaker, I would finally
like to yield to my co-sponsor
from.
Sandoval.
Thank you, Mr.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, kind lady. Um, I am raising
his support. I did co-sponsor
this bill as well several years
ago, um, I happen to be at the
Veterans Administration, um, ER
and there was uh ER doctor there
that was talking to me about
how um they use this for PTSD
and how he has seen remarkable
results on this with our
veterans and so after.
After having that meeting with
him, I had uh done a lot of
studying and seeing the major
universities across the United
States as well as the world that
has done quite a few studies in
reference to this, so I, um.
And then I also know of a
therapist that works within
these uh clinics to study this
as well. So I believe that this
is something that can really
help our veterans, people that
are severely depressed and also
have um certain addictions, so I
am so fortunate to be able to
co-sponsor this bill today.
Thank you, A.
There is a debate, gentlemen
from Lincoln and Otero
Representative Vincent.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, as a
gentle lady from Bern Leo Yale.
Mr. Speaker, I move, I, I yield
to the sorely missed member of
Health and Human Services.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and
thank you, gentle lady. I'll
take a compliment anytime I can
get one.
Mr. Speaker and gentle la.
I listened to this during the
interim, and I was a no.
And
I was a no, and I mean a hard
no, up until 3 days ago.
And I had
A nice doctor, and I had two
people that were under this
therapy and Mr. Speaker and Jim
Lady, I'm usually pretty hard to
convince once I dig my heels in,
but after hearing the testimony
on this.
And knowing that this treatment
is under a doctor's supervision,
and
It's not a really nice
experience, Mr. Speaker, but it
does help people and it helped
the two individuals that I
talked to, and I just wanted to
tell the body in case there was
anybody that had some
reservations on this, that,
that's what I experienced,
that's who I talked to, and, um,
I'm gonna support your bill
today. Thank you.
There's really to be a gentleman
from Sandoval, Representative
Martinez Thank you Mr. Speaker.
We kind lady, uh, yield, Mr.
Speaker, I yield to the
gentleman from.
Valencia Sandoval Sandoval.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, kind
lady, um,
I know this is just setting up
the program, but do you?
Envision
How do you, how many people do
you envision this helping it'll
it'll go through, I believe.
Um
Groups that go through the
system.
How, what size of the groups do
you think it'll be and how many
do you think we'll be able to
help?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
that's a little bit hard to
project part of what the board
will do is figure out the best
treatment protocol, um, there
will be a pre, um, experience
session and then the experience
during the session and then it
kind of a debriefing or um.
I can't remember the word, but
so there will be at least 3
appointments for lack of a
better word and as I said, the
board will figure out the best
treatment protocol.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank
you, kind lady. I, I also.
Um
I want to urge the body to
support this bill.
Um, I've seen.
Some of
Some of my veterans go through
the system.
Uh, that have had to go out of
the country to be able to uh.
Be able to go through this
program and the the.
Results are incredible.
Um, one of them happened to be a
good friend of mine who has
since passed.
Um
That had not left his house in 3
years and after going through
this program at the urging of
his wife.
Um, he's back working.
He's spending time with his
grandkids, um.
This,
Scared me at first when I first
heard about this years ago.
Uh, but I've seen the results of
what can happen and I stand and
urge the body to uh support this
bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
There is for the debate,
gentlemen from Korea Debaco,
Guadalupe Roosevelt and San
Miguel, Representative Zamora.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, the
gentle lady yielder, I yield to
the gentleman from all those
counties.
So I haven't, I hadn't seen this
bill till now and I was going
over it real quick, but, uh, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady, can you
fill me in as to.
Who
Will be able to take these
treatments.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, let
me find that in the bill.
Um.
Oh, Mr. Speaker and gentlemen on
page 3 starting on line 8,
qualifying condition includes
major treatment resistant
depression.
Post post traumatic stress
disorder substance use
disorders, end of life care and
other conditions approved by the
department.
And that's the Department of
Health.
And, and
Mr. Speaker and gentle ladies,
so substant, uh, on the
substance use disorders.
What, what kind of substances
are we talking about that this
would help, uh, disorders.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen,
opioids, um, alcohol, pretty
much any substance that can be
um addictive.
So Mr. Speaker and gentle
ladies, so somebody has some
issues with cannabis, this could
help him.
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen.
Ordinarily cannabis is not
addictive, but theoretically
yes.
OK, thank you for that, gentle
lady. And, and it's not just.
It, it's for anybody.
Uh, that needs his help. It, it
doesn't.
Disqualify any
Uh, certain, uh, patients, does
it?
Mr. Speaker and gentlemen, only
severe mental illnesses.

Speaker. Will you take me to
that point?
placing Senate Bill 7 on final
passage has been taken, and it
is subject to debate amendment,
or substitution gen lady to
explain the bill.
I think, Mr. Speaker, Senate
Bill 7 authorizes municipalities
to acquire, operate and maintain
a municipal utility for storm
water and to collect a
reasonable fee for such
services, but that I stand for
questions.
Guadalupe Roosevelt, San Miguel,
Representative Zamora. Thank you
Mr. Speaker. Well, the gentle
lady yield.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, I yield to my
good friend from all those
counties.
So thank you, gentle lady, uh,
So I, I had.
The honor of hearing this bill
twice in committee, once in in
egg and water and then once in
government. Thank you for doing
that, Mr. Speaker. Uh,
But in Aging water, I debated
the bill pretty heavy.
I wasn't
Comfortable with the bill.
But I voted for the bill.
But then I didn't sleep good at
night, uh, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady.
And the reason being.
Is because we're imposing a fee.
On the residents of the
municipalities.
Madam, Mr. Speaker and gentle
lady, can you tell me
How storm water has been handled
before.
There, there has to be a way
that we've been
Taxing the infrastructure.
And the, then the handling of
the water.
So, so my concerns are is Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady is how
has it been handled before?
Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, so, uh, the wave
stormwater was funded before is
through a GRT tax through the uh
general fund.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
what about property taxes?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, only for
flood control districts were
were funded through property
tax.
OK, Mr. Speaker and gentle lady,
can you introduce your expert
witness, please. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker, uh, gentlemen, so my
expert witness is Sarah Herto.
Her
Hotel. It's a French name. You
could tell it's all those extra
letters, um, conservation
biologist from integrated
Biological Solutions.
Thank you for that, Mr. Speaker
and gentle lady.
So
I
What what about property taxes,
gentle lady, let's, let's get
back on that those.
Can those property taxes be used
for for storm water drainage
projects and, and the handling
of the stormwater. Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, not through the
municipal code.
OK, and Mr. Speaker, gentle
lady, let's let's go to
stormwater then what is the
definition of stormwater. I
don't, I don't see it in the
bill.
Is am I missing it somewhere,
gentle lady or, or we don't have
a definition for it.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
stormwater is exactly what you
think it is. It's water that uh
results from a storm.
Mr. Speaker, uh,
I need a little help here.
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady
getting on a more serious note
again.
You know
We see.
Our constituencies.
In the in the state of New
Mexico and it doesn't matter who
it is everybody in this chamber
has constituency that's having a
hard time.
Meeting
Their house payments.
Their insurance payments.
We, we have a big problem with
insurance in the state of New
Mexico.
And the cost of groceries and
everything and then here we go.
Putting another fee.
On top of everything else that
they already pay out.
How much
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady, how
much will this fee be?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so it
would be up to each municipality
to set a fee and uh Mr. Speaker,
gentlemen, I also am being
reminded by my expert that this
is just a, an enabling
legislation. It does not require
a municipality to set up a fee.
It does not require the charging
of the fee. It's just
unenabling.
That you.
So Mr. Speaker and gentle lady.
So
I understand in the bill that,
that that's enables the
municipalities to set a fee.
And then what would keep
A
Municipality like in Riodoso.
From putting on
A large fee because of the
issues that they had there with
the floods, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so,
um, it's usually depends upon
how much impervious surface
water is uh present on each
property, and it's a democratic
process, so, um, whatever, uh,
entity is set up for the
management of the storm water
would have to um go through a
process that is approved by its
constituency and whatever fees
would be um instituted would
have to be approved.
democratically through that
process.
OK, and, and Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady, if I'm reading
between the lines what you're
telling me is.
This fee can be whatever.
and my, and my
On the right track here, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, it could
be whatever is approved by those
municipalities that choose to
Take advantage of this enabling
legislation.
OK, and, and Mr. Speaker and
gentle ladies, so we hit on two
points there.
It can be whatever and what it's
uh what is approved.
Right? And my, and my
I, I think I quoted you
correctly. Am I right, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady? Mr.
Speaker, gentle lady, to make it
gentlemen, to make it more exact
it is whatever is proved.
OK, thank you for that, Mr.
Speaker, and gentle lady and Mr.
Speaker, with that I have an
amendment to for this bill.
Gentlemen, will you kindly bring
it to the chief clerk.
And make sure you sign it.
And, and Mr. Speaker, it's a
friendly amendment.
I'm sure it is gentlemen I asked
for a roll call vote.
It fits so friendly, where do
you want a roll call vote?
You've got a roll call.
A lot of friendly words in this
amendment, gentlemen.
What is the 232 number on the
bottom?
036.4, Mr. Speaker.
That's what he got.
We get it passed out. We'll get
it posted online, and then I'll
come back to you to explain.
You're friendly amendment.
OK, gentlemen, it looks like the
amendment has been passed out
and it is posted online.
Gentlemen, to explain the
amendment.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and, and
gentle lady.
So, so body what this amendment
does.
Is it puts a cap on the fee.
And where, where we try to keep
it.
To a point where people can,
can.
Hopefully they can afford it.
And as much as I hate to see a
fee on, on, added on to people
for, for something that's
already been being taken care of
today.
And the next thing it does, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady.
Is if a municipality is gonna
impose this fee.
It has to be on.
The ballot and, and be voted for
by the citizens of that m
municipality.
So that way,
Our constituency isn't
blindsided by another fee from
the state of New Mexico.
Or from the mean that we, we
allowed through the state from
the municipality. They, the, the
citizens of that.
Municipality ought to know as
well as anybody if, if they
want.
Or need to put these monies into
the municipality.
Mr. Speaker, with that, I stand
for questions. ladies, is this a
friendly amendment Mr. Speaker,
unfortunately, this is not a
friendly amendment.
OK.
Gentle lady from Santa Fe.
Mr. Speaker, I move to Table
House floor amendment number 1
to Senate Bill 7.
We're on a tabling motion to
house floor amendment number 1
to Senate Bill 7.
I would of yes. The amendment is
tabled. Vote of no. We're back
on the amendment 32nd book
clock, the vote is now open.
What's about the clothes?
The boys are closed. I voted 40
in the affirmative, 25 in the
negative. House floor amendment
number 12 Senate Bill 7 has been
tabled.
Gentlemen from all those
counties you sell the floor.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker, and I, and I still have
a few questions for the gentle
lady.
So
Why, why do we, do we?
Add on another fee on top of the
taxes that are already being
paid.
To take care of the storm water.
And, and are we taxing?
The storm water or we taxing or,
or, or set.
Put a fee on the storm water or
put a fee on the property, uh,
Mr. Speaker and gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so it's
just like any other fee for
service, and it would, it would
be associated with the property.
So, so, Mr. Speaker and, and
gentle lady, so the water.
The water is what's.
Causing the fees. Am I getting
that right, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I mean,
um, whenever you have large
amounts of storm water resulting
from, um, a storm or um some
other.
Weather related event it causes,
it can cause damage. It needs to
be contained, um, and so it, it,
it requires someone to do that,
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, it
requires either municipal
municipality to, to do that and
dispose of the water correctly
or that owner without, let's say
the structure within this bill
would have to expend money to do
it themselves.
Or they may not be able to
afford to, and that can cause
further damage.
So Mr. Speaker and gentle
ladies, so, so the storm water.
Leaves the property.
Whether, whether it's a business
or or or a private residence or
whatever the storm water leaves
the property and hits the street
and goes down the storm drain.
And all those drains are in
place.
And the, the roads there, the
sidewalks there to take care of
the drainage and everything.
Why I can't get to the point as
to why we're charging a fee on
that water that's already gone
down the drain. Can you get me
there?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, I, I, I
think the first problem is that
you're assuming that every
municipality has a street.
And a drain for the water, for
the water to be caught and uh
and so uh that's, you know, the
first complication there.
OK, so, so, Mr. Speaker and
gentle lady then explained to me
what this.
Feed the monies that the
municipality receives what it's
gonna be used for, uh, Mr.
Speaker and gentle lady.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, so
that's exactly what this fee
would be for to manage and
construct infrastructure for
those places that don't have the
streets or the gullies or uh
the, the um
The bio swells for this water to
go into. So, um, this is a
mechanism to allow for that to
be constructed, that
infrastructure to come.
To come about.
Mr. Speaker, and gentle lady,
the, the way I understood the
bill.
I it's gonna be used to handle
the storm water, not to build
infrastructure.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, I
think handling should be uh
interpreted rather broadly in
this sense and not handling
could mean, um, constructing
infrastructure through which the
water would flow or um.
Getting someone out there to
contain the water themselves,
handling, handling is, should
be, uh, interpreted broadly in
this sense.
So, so then.
I'm getting confused here if
we're going to use this to build
roads.
Also so that the water can.
Can be handled or.
Why, why should this money that
we're charging for a fee for
handling water.
Why should it be used for roads
and, and, and other
infrastructure like that, Mr.
Speaker, gentlemen, it will not
be used for roads. It'll be used
for pipes, drains.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
natural infrastructure, so
utilization and building a burns
for the water to flow downhill.
It's well I I guess I have to
agree with you, uh, Madam
Speaker and, and gentle lady
that
That
That that it is pretty broad.
Broadly, uh, I guess.
Written on the, on, on the bill
if, if we're gonna be able to
use these this money.
For such a, such a broad.
variety of things that have
anything to do with stormwater.
You know
And
In my
City of Clo in the city of
Clovis.
Uh, Madam Speaker and gentle
lady.
We have done millions.
Of dollars of drainage projects.
Without this fee existing.
Can you give me a, an example as
to how we're going to piggyback
this.
On top of
The other monies that we're
getting for that infrastructure,
why, why is this needed and, and
how are we going to piggyback
this on top of all the other
monies that we have for that
type of infrastructure, uh,
Madam Speaker and gentle lady.
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, so
first and foremost, um, this is
again an elective. This is just
an enabling act so this gives
municipality or a community, the
ability to choose whether or not
they want to impose this fee for
this particular purpose. This is
completely separate and apart
from infrastructure that uh
might be requested or built
through the state such as roads.
Um, and it, uh, again, it is a
um
Is a choice.
And a tool given to a
municipality so as to ensure
that this service is the cost of
it is spread amongst those who
would specifically be using it.
It has nothing to do with state
infrastructure. It has nothing
to do with um fees related to
state imposed infrastructure and
then there's also um grants and
other opportunities for match
funding if we
If we do it through an enabling
statute using this structure.
OK, and, and, and Mr. Speaker,
Miss, uh, Madam Speaker and
gentle lady, so.
You
Can, can Madam Speaker if I'm
allowed and gentle lady, if you
feel comfortable, can we go back
to the amendment and and can you
explain to me why it was
unfriendly on the part of
capping.
That price.
Mr. Madam Speaker, gentlemen,
um, I think clearly the cap is
unfriendly because you're asking
us to take a crystal ball and um
and ensure that whatever costs
are incurred for this service
have to be kept under this
arbitrary amount of 550 per
month, um, we will, we have no
ability to know whether or not
this would be a sufficient
amount, um, to accomplish.
Storm water control, uh, if it
were to be adopted.
OK, and, and then on the other
part.
About the citizens being able
to.
To vote on it
Uh, Madam Speaker and gentle
lady.
How, how do you feel?
About that part of it.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, so, um,
what the unfriendly aspect of
your amendment was that,
firstly, with the way the bill
is drafted right now. It is
already a democratic process in
an ordinance must be passed
through that municipality,
meaning whatever form of
government that municipality
has, if it's a city council, if
it's a county commission,
whatever it is, right? So you
already have process baked into
this, and you
already have local control baked
into this. Madam Speaker,
gentlemen, and so to expand the
process to require it to
essentially be a ballot measure,
you would be incurring uh a a
completely unnecessary cost to
the citizens of that area or
that municipality, because, uh,
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, um,
local elections, all elections
are costly, um, and
measures are costly, and um you
could essentially, Madam
Speaker, gentlemen, accomplish
the same thing through the
processes already has already
prescribed in this bill, which
is the the passing of an
ordinance through the local
government and local control of
that municipality.
OK, uh.
You know, you know, I just,
madam Speaker and gentle lady, I
just feel like
Like, uh,
The citizens might be surprised
at the end of the day what we
did to him.
And, and I feel like.
Citizens in, in Riodosa with the
floods and and other places that
have had floods like they might.
And this might sneak up on him
and and cost him no telling how
much money at the end of the
day.
Uh, Madam Speaker and gentle
lady, thanks for the debate, and
I have no more questions.
There's further debate, the
gentleman from Otero
representative block.
Thank you so much, Madam
Speaker. Good to see you again
with the kind gentle lady from
Berna Leo, please yield.
Madam Speaker, I yelled to my
friend from Otero County. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. So I just have
a few questions, uh, a lot fewer
questions than previous bills,
but Mr. Speaker, gentle lady,
I'm just wondering.
So this takes it away from the
voters is the way I see it and
gives it to the municipality to
just vote on it like their city
commission or their city
councils that kind of the way I
understand the changes.
Mr. Madam Speaker, gentle lady.
Um, Madam Speaker, gentlemen,
are you talking about the, um
proposed failed amendment from
the gentlemen from all those
counties? No, Mr. Madam Speaker,
General Whitti, I'm talking
about the bill itself. So when
it comes to the bill itself,
would it take away the ability
to have an election to raise the
fees and instead it would give
the opportunity for the
municipality to vote as the
council to raise those feeser,
gentlemen, precisely the bill is
drafted so that the
Municipality, the local
government of that municipality
would be able to go through the
pro the process of passing an
ordinance.
To implement this fee.
All right, thank you, Madam
Speaker and gentle Liddy. OK, so
I guess that's kind of where I
have a little bit of, and I hate
to use the word heartburn or uh
apprehension to voting for this
because I would rather have the
ability for the voters to vote
on it as citizens instead of
just 7 or 5 elected members of
the council to vote on it. So
Madam Speaker and gentle lady,
I'm just wondering, uh, since
this is increasing the cost.
To our residents potentially.
I'm wondering, Madam Speaker
General Liddy, wouldn't it be in
the best interest to have an
election since it's a one time.
fee that they would have to pay
for that election rather than
Not having the input of the
voters.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, imagine
if you had to have or call an
election every time the city
that you lived in wanted to
increase your trash collection
fee.
That's what I think the issue
would be right there.
OK, Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
and actually would love that. I
would love them to have a ballot
measure every time they wanted
to increase fees for us because
right now as it stands, it's
hard enough to live as it is.
It's very expensive, especially
with the trash pickup fees and
the water fees. We actually just
increased our water fees from
the commission just a few weeks
ago or maybe a few months ago
and that increased some
tremendously. So, Madam Speaker,
generally, I actually think that
would be a great idea for every
single
fee. So Madam Speaker, gentle
lady, when it comes to these
improvements, are we, do we have
any provisions in here that
would protect from
Things getting in the water like
POs or anything like that. Does
this have anything to do with
PFOS.
Madam Speaker John, and no, it
does not.
OK, thank you, Madam Speaker and
gentle lady, and then I just, I
wonder, so.
Under the bill, and I, I had a
copy of the bill earlier,
earlier, and Lord knows where it
went, but Madam Speaker, gentle
lady, this changes NMSA 3-41-2
requiring voter approval, is
that?
What it's changing.
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, give
us one second here.
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, it
changes the municipal code
3-1-2.
OK, perfect, Madam Speaker,
gentle lady, we're on the same
page. Awesome. I had to look for
my bill, which I just
Populated now. So Madam Speaker,
gentle lady, I'm wondering, does
this, does New Mexico's laws
currently show that
There's a constitutional
emphasis on taxpayer consent for
new or expanded revenue
generating mechanisms.
Um, Madam Speaker, gentlemen,
uh, just taking it back to the
purpose of the bill, all it does
is give that municipality, all
it does is grant that
municipality the ability to add
stormwater disposal to the list
of services that are already
provided by that municipality.
OK, Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
I'm just wondering, I, Susan,
one of my analyses that it said
that
the question was how does this
reconcile with New Mexico's
constitutional emphasis on
taxpayer consent for new or
expanded revenue generating
mechanisms, so.
Mr. Madam Speaker and gentle
lady, I'm just wondering if
there's anything in the
constitution that would kind of
limit this in any way?
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, um,
not within the four corners of
this bill. Uh, if, if you're
asking larger constitutional
questions outside of the scope
of this bill, um, I am not the
expert on that. I'm not the
person to ask to, especially as
it relates to this matter and um
I, I don't believe that's within
the um.
Within the scope of in which
Miss Harto Herto is here as
well.
OK, Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
yeah, I just don't want to get
into any situation where
oversteps the bounds of whatever
constitutional parameters are
there and it didn't cite any
section, so I'm not sure which
it's talking about, but I just
wanted to flag that for you. So,
Madam Speaker, gentle lady, I
also am wondering when it comes
to.
This, is there anything that
precludes a local municipality
from raising fees.
At a rapid amount of time. So
let's just say they raised fees
at one meeting, 11 month, and
then the very next month, they
raised fees again. Is there
anything that precludes them
from doing it at a certain time
frame.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, gentlemen,
there's nothing within this bill
that sets forth a schedule as to
when, um, again, these fees
could be implemented by a
municipality um as stated
previously, this is just an
enabling act. All this does is
grant the municipality, the
ability to um charge this fee
for service to its uh
Constituency, if it so chooses.
This is just an enabling act.
OK, thank you, Madam Speaker and
gentle lady, and then also I had
a question about does this
increased liability for the
municipalities in any way?
Mr. Speaker, Madam Speaker, my
apologies, Madam Speaker. Uh,
gentlemen, no, because, uh, the
municipalities are already
managing storm water.
As it is
All right. Thank you, Madam
Speaker, and generally. OK, so,
and then when we talk about
fees, I always think of fees as
taxes. That's, that's what I
hear when I, when I hear ee
because it's a tax essentially
for using the water system. Is
that correct?
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, not
quite. Um, this is a
attacks when I think of attacks,
um, it is kind of a, a grander
scale in partaking in the, the
social contract, um, when I
think of the fee, Madam Speaker,
gentlemen, you are getting
something, you are getting a
service for that fee.
OK, Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
so then would there be a case to
be made that when I pay my
income tax, I get nothing in
return.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, no, you
get to partake in the wonderful
uh social contract you get to
drive on our roads. You get to,
um, if it were snowing outside,
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, you
would be able to uh reap the
benefit of a snowplow. There's
lots of things that you get for
the value of your taxes every
day.
So, Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
put that snowplow would be a
service, would it not be? Madam
Speaker, gentlemen, um, not
really because you could elect
to stop driving on the roads,
the snow plow is uh utilized on
this is much more of this is
again specific to a municipality
if they should choose to offer
this service and it is attached
to a property. So again, you
have to choose the.
Municipal municipality has to
choose to offer the service, and
you have to live on a property
with which that service would be
associated. So much, much more
narrow in scope.
OK, Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
so would it be kind of like a
property tax then because it's
based upon the actual property
and not just generally a road.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, no, it
would not be like a property
tax. It's a service.
OK, Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
well then the service, I just
think it's, it's, it's a very
complicated when it comes to
what a services and a fee versus
a tax and I, I hear tax because
it's something that I can't
choose to opt into a mandated to
opt into. And so, Madam Speaker,
gentle lady, do we know how much
this would cost each resident
with the passage of this. How
much does it on average cost
each resident a month for such a
fee as this.
Or, yeah, it's a fee, not a tax,
even though it's a tax.
Uh, Mr. Speak Madam Speaker,
gentlemen, it would be based
upon um a service of the volume
of of storm water that's going
into the storm system. So that
is what the fee would be based
upon.
OK, Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
but I guess I just don't have
any.
Understanding of how much it's
gonna rain. I'm not like I don't
have a crystal ball. I can't say
it's gonna rain a lot this next
year, so would it be every
year's rain fall, would that be
what I'm taxed on, or would it
be based upon just the building
and the upkeep of that that
system.
Mr. Speaker, Madam Speaker,
gosh, what is my issue, madam? I
am so sorry. Madam Speaker,
gentlemen, again, it would be
based on the volume of the storm
water.
Going into the system, that was,
that is what the fee would be
based upon.
OK, Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
how do we track it?
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, um, so
if I were to give you an exact
answer, it would be speculation,
because again, uh this is an
enabling act. It gives each
municipality the ability to,
first of all, even in an act
this fee for service. And
secondly, we give them the
freedom to be able um.
To put together a fee contract,
um, in a way that would best
serve that municipality, um, my
expert does tell me though,
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, that
it's usually based upon um the
amount of impervious surface. I
am not a water expert, but I'm
learning something here today. I
pervious surface on that
property, um, and that's how
they usually figure out what the
amount, uh, the volume of the
store.
water would be.
OK, thank you, Madam Speaker
Generaletti, and we're both
learning some things because I
had no idea if that was how we
measured it either. So, Madam
Speaker, gentle lady, a few more
questions. Can you tell me where
in the bill it says we're
measuring by volume?
Where specifically which line
page does it say volume?
Uh, Madam Speaker, gentlemen, it
does not. Again, this is an
enabling act. This is all
speculation.
OK, Madam Speaker, gentle
ladies, so then we don't know if
it, if they'll use volume. Is
that my understanding since it's
speculative.
Mrs Madam Speaker, gentlemen,
that's the national standard,
um, that is usually chosen, um,
to measure volume and, uh, as a
result, cost.
All right, Madam Speaker, gentle
lady, I just kind of have a
problem because we don't define
it, define that in the bill, we
don't say it has to be by
volume, we say just on a
national scale, they're mostly
doing it this way. And so.
I do have concerns when it comes
to, I'm guessing rulemaking.
Would this be rulemaking that we
would be putting the measurement
requirements.
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, um,
no, this would be again up to
each municipality.
Some Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
would they have to put in the
ordinance, the way that they're
tracking it specifically and
what does it say that they have
to specify in the bill where
that ordinance must say which
way we're actually going to
track it. Where does it say
that? Madam Speaker, gentlemen,
it does not say that all of the
bill requires is that an
ordinance be passed.
All right. Thank you, Madam
Speaker, gentle lady. I think
that is also a concern that I
have because as residents, we
don't know which way we're gonna
track it, so it may be more
expensive if we use volume
versus a different way to track
how much water is being pushed
through when we get a freak
storm, for example, and will
that shoot up our costs that
month that because we had a
crazy freak storm versus the
next month where we just have
regular rainfall. I find it to
just be not very specific or it
doesn't really.
not prescriptive. And so I guess
that's kind of my concern with
the bill as well as taking it
away from voter approval. I
think every time that someone's
going to levy a tax on somebody
or an increase in in the service
fees, whatever we're gonna call
them. I think it's super
important that we have the voter
input because as residents I
want, I wanna say, and I might
go to that city council meeting
and, and stop it or try to stop
it, but I only have one voice on
one city council person who's my
city councilor. So I just find
it to be a little, a little more
restrictive when it comes to
free speech, which
is something that I find to be a
problem, but I will continue to
listen to the debate and um I'm
very much against increasing
taxes. Thank you, Madam Speaker
and gentle lady.
Further debate
Yeah
There is further debate. The
gentleman from Katherine Grant
and Hidalgo, representative
Terazas.
Thank you Esimala speaker.
For may I please have that with
the gentle lady please real.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the
gentleman, uh, from.
Catherine Grant Hidalgo.
Thank you Madam Speaker so
I've just been listening to the
debate and I and you know what
we can get into the weeds of
this is tax, this is a service,
this is that. I think, I think,
Madam Speaker.
Um
What the problem that we're
having and I'm just gonna kind
of lay it out because I'm not
trying to.
is we have municipalities that
are struggling financially to
put in this infrastructure
probably and I'm gonna ask you a
couple of questions about that
but we also have.
Our constituents and our
residents were.
Complaining to us right about
how much they paid for um I
don't know, water, gas,
utilities, whatever some of the
things that whether it's garbage
pickup and all the all the
things that that you pay the
city for, you know, depending on
what city you're in.
And so I had a gentleman just to
to give you a perspective of of
what why I'm saying this is I
had a gentleman that when I was
knocking doors.
And he says,
puestocentodo
uh
yeah.
I went, what?
Let me explain what you just
said to me you're not one of
those guys that attacks me and
wants to charge me for
everything. I think we're just
left for you to tax me.
On the sun
On the rays of the sun. I just,
it shocked me some because
they're struggling, right?
People are struggling to pay
their bills, especially those,
um, Madam Speaker, on fixed
incomes and so those you know
those are the people that hurt
the most.
At the same time we have needed
infrastructure on the other side
and, and sometimes we struggle
maybe maybe we could do it
through Capital Ali. I'm not
sure, Madam Speaker, um, but
I think, I think what you were
trying to say is this is when
you say impervious surface.
Speaker, this is going to be
those who have.
Um
Parking lots are paved paved or
concrete services, hard
services, uh, that's where
they're gonna calculate some of
this, I would imagine would you
is that sound right, Madam
Speaker? Madam Speaker,
gentlemen, yes, that and
rooftops.
So Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
and, and so basically what
you're saying this is already
this happens in the land use
code when you're gonna build a
new building, it's generally for
um uh uh.
Commercial property, you go down
and you go to the, when you get
your permit, you're required to
follow the land use code that
requires you to create a water
retention pond just, just so
that you know I I'm not sure if
you knew this, but Madam
Speaker, when you went and build
You already required to have a
water retention pond and I'm
gonna say in most
municipalities, um, I would say
I think they adopted it in in
state in state statutes where if
you build something you have to
have a water retention pond and
so that some of these places and
you'll see them when you drive
into, I don't know, Walmart or
where Albertson's or whatever
these these parking lots you'll
see an area where they have
this.
Cut out area and it's all fenced
out and it's just a ditch
sitting there. Well, that's just
to.
To do this water they call it a
water retention pond so that you
are taking care of your storm
water.
So I'm kind of conflicted
because we already told him,
look, if you do this, you're
going to control your own storm
water.
But Madam Speaker, if we pass
this, now keep in mind I'm gonna
go back a little bit, Madam
Speaker. We're this is opening
the door for municipalities and
local governments, I would say
just to select and and I wanna
make sure I understand this
right. This is just for
municipalities or is it also for
counties, Madam Speaker?
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, this
is only for municipalities Madam
Speaker, thank you for
clarifying that. I thought
that's what I thought, OK, so
Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
what, what I'm trying to say is
we've already told the business
look you have to manage your own
storm water.
You will have to put in storm
drains, you will have to have a
water retention pond and it will
be all calculated and based on
the amount of water runoff, uh,
to a 100 year storm.
I'm not sure if you knew that
and so they already had to pay
to put in that infrastructure
which is an expensive. I've done
it.
And so, Madam Speaker, now we're
coming back and saying to
municipal municipalities and
saying hey you know what, um, I
know you can't, you don't have
the storm drains that you need
so you can go ahead and.
Charge people based on the
number of the, the amount, the
size of the parking lot, so long
as they're paved.
Or the size of your roof because
that's basically how they uh
calculate storm water.
And so I don't know what those
figures will be, but that'll be
another additional uh monthly
charge that they'll have based
on on on that so my question,
Madam Speaker, gentle lady is.
Is there anything on this
legislation again, I'm not
trying to beat it up. I'm just
trying to understand it a little
bit, but.
Is there anything in this in
this legislation that says that
a municipality cannot just dump
this money into the general fund
if they're gonna, if they're
gonna charge this.
That's gonna go into a separate
fund especially for this
infrastructure, Madam Speaker.
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, so,
um, the, the, that's the whole
point of this enabling
legislation is so that this
money can be utilized for this
type of infrastructure related
to storm water uh cleanup and
usage only so that we can stop
utilizing either capital outlay
funding or other monies that
came from the general funds when
that money can be put to
good use doing something else
somewhere else.
So Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
that's exactly what I'm saying
so is there anything in your
bill that specifies that
municipality if we're gonna give
you this, we're gonna open this
door we're gonna tell you, OK,
municipality, we're gonna allow
you guys to.
Charged basically.
I'll use the word charged so I
don't.
To charge people for this
infrastructure.
Can't just dump it into the
general fund though you have to
use the money that's there.
To for that specific purpose.
And I don't really like to type
things, but if you're gonna,
it'd be like if I'm just
charging for garbage service and
then they'll pick up your trash
and this is the problem, Madam
Speaker. It's just I'm just we
all have our districts and in my
district it's depends on where
I'm at on my district. Some
people are like, it doesn't
matter. I'm OK with water rate
other people are like almost
every door.
I'm tired of my water rates
being so high and so if I come
back and say well now now that
you're gonna, they're gonna see
this this is the rain, the the
rainwater.
uh, the, they might not really
like it, and now this fee will
be for residential and
commercial.
Madam Speaker, so the point that
I'm making is if we're gonna.
Open this door.
Does it require the city to
Set it aside so specifically
used for that purpose.
Uh, Madam Speaker, gentlemen, so
firstly there are over 2000
stormwater utilities throughout
the country, so this is not a
novel idea by any means, um, and
so through this legislation
again and enabling act the
municipalities would be able to
charge fee for this service or
have this money set aside so
that they could actually get
access to, uh, the public, um,
the the public water revolving
the state revolving.
Fund, which is a grant, right,
which does require um a matching
of some kind, but it would
actually help them um get access
to a larger amount of money so
that they could essentially pay
for more infrastructure. So it's
also designed to give a
municipality more options as to
how they want to manage the
stormwater issue.
Madam Speaker, gentle lady, I, I
was gonna ask you that was one
of my questions is the matching
funds is it you don't, uh, and,
and I'm again I'm not gonna push
you but sometimes it's like a
5050 50-50 sometimes it's 10%
match. A lot of times that's
nice if it's 10, but I don't
know what the match is on that
specific program with your
expert Paulino.
Uh, Madam Speaker, Dylan, my
expert unfortunately does not
know. OK, that's fine, Madam
Speaker. I just, I think from
my, my problem is, uh.
That, you know, my issue is is
really kind of caught. I'm
caught between Madam Speaker,
the people that I that I knock
doors on and and they struggle
with with the uh.
Their daily utilities,
especially when the, the ones
that were on fixed incomes, and
I don't think you're trying to
beat them up. I think you're
trying to solve the problem that
the city has with the lack of
funds and trying to leverage
their um there is the that that
uh that fund that we're talking
about the revolving, what is it
called the revolving.
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, the
state revolving fund
and so that they can leverage
this infrastructure, um.
And then I've got the other
thing in my mind I'm going, wait
a minute, we just.
CID forced everybody to create
their own.
Um
On a lot of projects in the last
20 years, maybe 25 years that
you had to create your own storm
water retention ponds and storm
water drain systems, uh, to for
a 100 year reign and then now
we're coming back and and doing
that so um that's really my only
issue, so thank you very much
for for answering those
questions appreciate it very
much.
There's further debate, the
gentle lady from Bernna Leo and
Sandoval, Representative Cates.
Thank you, Madam Speaker, um,
does my dear friend from Berna
Leo Yield, Madam Speaker, I
yield to my friend from Bernao
and Sandoval.
Madam Speaker, I just, um, I, I
am not a water expert as well,
um, but I was, uh, I was able to
hear this bill in committee and
so I just wanna make sure that I
understand and I think you've
done a great job, um, uh, Madam
Speaker and Representative of
explaining it but just to review
this is not a tax, it is a law
that will give permission to
municipalities.
To create a fee to manage storm
water. Is that an accurate
description, uh, Madam Speaker
and Representative Madam
Speakergenlani, that is spot on.
Thank you, Madam Speaker, um,
thank you very much so, um, I
just went for the body storm
water is a very dangerous and
needs to be managed and it's
also full of opportunity, um,
uh, Madam Speaker and
Representative, so manage is if
you are hitting rooftops and
asphalts, not in a natural
setting, municipalities, it will
rush, it will rush, it will
trash, it will carry debris. It
can ruin buildings as uh uh as
well as safety is that uh a fair
assessment, Madam Speaker
Representative?
Madam Speaker, Representative, I
think you look, need to look no
farther than um the unbelievably
devastating flood damage that we
have seen in our communities,
Riidoso and uh and other, you
know, Hermit's peak, Ca Canyon
fires, storm waters, incredibly
dangerous and destructive, so
yes. Madam Speaker, I am sorry
that you have such a great um
example to provide for us in
such recent memory, but yes,
thank you very much for that
and.
And then it also stormwater can
provide a great opportunity if
we slow it down if we allow it
to sit for just a few hours, we
can use it to recharge our
aquifers. We can, uh, take an
opportunity to be able to clean
it before it hits our river, so
is that a fair assessment as
well as part of our management
of stormwater, Madam Speaker,
Representative.
Madam Speaker, Representative,
that is correct, stormwater,
even if it could be a threat, it
also presents a great
opportunity as well.
Thank you, Madam Sir. Thank you,
Representative. So this is to
allow municipalities, um, this
bill comes to us in this format
because by doing so, we will
allow a municipalities to come
up with their own ordinance that
will allow them to charge a fee,
which is a structure and only
that structure that would make
them eligible for some avenues
of federal funding for matching.
Is that affair, um,
Assessment, uh, Madam Webb.
Uh, Madam Speaker,
Representative, yes it is.
OK, thank you very much so we
know that stormwater comes in
dangers and opportunities. This
is not a tax. This is an
opportunity for municipalities
to take control of their uh of
their municipality and be able
to create a funding stream to be
able to address those
opportunities and dangers, um,
this is also, um, uh, Madam
Speaker, can you uh let me know
what the term person controlling
real
property. Do you know what that
means, uh, madam?
Speaker and representative.
Madam Speaker, gentle lady, I
assume it'd be the person who is
in control of the uh the
applicable property, um, but,
uh, Madam Speaker, gentle lady,
that is a definition that is in
current statute, it is not um
being altered or it's not a new
proposal by any means in this
bill. Thank you, Madam Speaker,
and thank you, uh, dear friend
from Bernard Leo, you know, one
of the reasons I love being
representative is I learned
something new every day.
So thank you very much. That was
something I did not know of, um,
so, um, so let's go back to we
have currently may have zonings
in uh municipality for as, as
our uh kind colleague stated for
commercial properties that would
require drainage. So Madam
Speaker Representative, that is
required because if I build a
house or a commercial property
next to
somebody else who has a
commercial property. If I don't
install those things, there's a
very good chance it could be
damaging my neighbor's property,
so this is not a tax or
something that the government's
making me do this is, uh, uh, as
you, I, I so forget, Madam
Speaker, you said are, our
cultural, uh.
I can't remember your, your,
your terminology, Madam Whip, it
was so good, Madam Speaker, uh,
generally, gentle person is at
the social contract? Yes,
there's a social contract to
make sure that my commercial
property is not damaged, and
that is why when you create your
commercial property, you need to
comply with those uh zoning laws
of drainage, which is not
necessarily what this act is, it
might support that, but it's not
the
Engine for that. Would that be a
fair assessment, Madam Speaker
and Madam Webb?
Madam Speaker, gentle person, it
would. OK, interest of time, I
just would like to bring the
body's attention to one thing
and then I will sit, I promise,
is, uh, in, in your binder, you
see, look who who's supporting
this bill, um, I hope the body
understands that Skafka in
Sandoval County we have to
always do our shout out to my
flood control and Skafka, Sierra
Club, the city of Farmington,
the mid Rio Grande Conservatory
District in the municipality of
Um, uh, we have on and on a
support for this, and I am so
grateful that you are giving
this. It will also help our
developers because the more
lands we have that are safe and
are controlled and managed with
our storm, the more we're able
to develop and grow New Mexico.
Thank you very much, Madam
Speaker, and thank you, Madam
Webb.
There's further debate. The
gentleman from Chavez, Eddie,
and Lee County.
Representative Mason.
Thank you, Madam Speaker, with a
gentle lady you.
Mansugar, Madam Speaker, I yield
to a kind gentleman from all
those counties.
Thank you, Madam Speaker, uh,
Representative, uh,
I have a few questions on this,
uh, basically,
Uh, this will set up a fund.
A fee
Who's who pays this fee in the
minute, is it, I mean.
Who's this? You say it's not a
tax, but it is a cost, so it's
the same as a tax it makes. It's
a mandate of a of money.
To the, to the municipality, is
that correct?
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, no,
all this bill does is it is an
enabling statute to allow
municipalities should they so
choose through local control to
uh.
To uh put forth a a local
ordinance that would need to be
voted on by that municipality
and approved to then levy a fee
for stormwater management.
represented, so this will have
to be voted on before the
municipality can impose this
fee. I'll have to be on the
general election with the
citizens.
I
Madam Speaker Speaker,
gentlemen, uh, this would go
through a uh a municipal.
process, so municipal ordinances
are usually voted upon by the,
let's say the, the municipal
council, the city council, uh,
representative government of of
of choice, whatever that
municipality has, so, um, I, I,
it's an ordinance that would
have to be voted upon by again
represent representative
government.
And it would then be put it
would put the fee for service in
place.
Thank you, uh, Representative,
uh, Madam Speaker,
Representative, who
will pay these fees if it's if
it is voted on by the
municipality to impose.
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, uh,
would be paid by those citizens
in the municipality according to
whatever structure that
municipality chooses uh as
stated in their ordinance.
Thank, thank you, Representative
Madam.
Uh
Madam Chair Representative,
basically, according to the way
I read it, the fees will be like
your.
And it's sunrise like a sewer
water fee.
Electric fee something imposed
on a monthly basis.
Madam Speaker, gentlemen,
correct.
Uh, in, in
In my experience, those fees are
paid by property owners. Is that
true? Representative?
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, that
is correct.
That's one more of my problems
represented, Madam Speaker, with
This legislating that to me it's
a will be a mandate put on a
certain segment of our
population without a general
vote of the population.
Property owners won't get to
decide whether they want to pay
this fee. Is that true?
It'll be by the municipality the
city council, whatever they will
oppose these fees, not a general
election.
Madam Speaker, gentlemen, uh, it
will be the fee will be imposed
by the municipality who would
then have to pass the ordinance.
That would grant them the
ability to uh charge the fee.
And property owners have
property within the specified
municipality.
Thank you, Representative, uh.
The uh
You know, this is not the first
year that we've had floods, you
know, in, in uh is uh
representative.
The more said in Clovis and
family of artesian and stuff.
We've been working on this
problem for years, you know,
through different, different
funds. It isn't, isn't there
different ways for cities to
Get funds for these type of
projects other than a, a local,
just a local.
Property tax.
Mr. Speaker, gentlemen, uh, it's
the beauty of this bill, it's
just another tool in the toolbox
that would not preclude any
other form, uh, of, of.
Taking care of this problem.
Thank you. uh, Madam Speaker,
Representative.
Just one little statement that
it always brings to my mind when
we impose these things without
Representation from the general
public is goes back to why the
United States is the United
States.
You know why we're, why we
succeeded from
From Britain
Uh, Madam Speaker, gentlemen, I,
I think it had something to do
with taxation without
representation, but, um, I,
again, I, I, are we dissuading
the, the, we have a structure
here. We have representative
government. We are a
representational republic, we um
elect people like all of our
wonderful colleagues here, we've
been elected to represent our
constituents, and so, Madam
Speaker, gentlemen,
It's the exact same process that
we're talking about here. I
agree with you and December, to
some respect, but we are not.
If we were gonna
have the general population
vote, the people that are
actually going to pay the fees
vote, not just the
representative is the way that I
would say this. I know in
Artesia, we have
The city of Artesia.
Has, has we voted on a bond
issue years ago.
Specifically to use for
infrastructure, infrastructure
for flood control.
In our city and every few years,
they can go back and draw on
that bond and
every so many years we as
citizens of Artesia vote whether
to continue the bond.
Which to me is a better way of
doing this other than men.
again,
a segment of the population.
To pay these fees.
We need
The property tax
People that own proper tax.
We're taxing them to death.
Everything we come up with,
that's an easy way to raise
money. I just let the guy that
owns the building or owns the
house.
If I wish you'd uh
Went with the
The amendment that allowed for a
general vote. It doesn't cost
much money to have a vote if you
put it on with the with the
general election.
It's very inexpensive.
But with that, I will, I will
the floor.
Seeing no further debate, the
gentle lady to close.
Thank you, Madam Speaker. um,
thanks for the fruitful and
interesting debate, learned a
lot about water law today, um,
just want to emphasize for the
body, Madam Speaker, that this
is just an enabling legislation
is another tool in the toolbox,
and with that, I move that
Senate Bill 7 do now pass.
We are on final passage.
Uh
Senate Bill 7.
The vote
is now
Open.
The vote is about to close.
The vote is now closed by a vote
of 46 in the affirmative, and 18
in the negative.
Senate Bill 7 has duly passed
the House.
Gentle lady from Berna Leo, are
you ready on item 47?
Adam Speaker, would you get me
to that point, please?
Let the record reflect that all
action necessary for placing
Senate Bill 100 on final passage
has been taken and that it is
now subject to debate amendment
or substitution, gentle lady to
explain the bill.
Thank you Madam Speaker.
Madam Speaker, Senate Bill 100
updates a MAFCA, uh, Albuquerque
Metropolitan Arroyo Flood
Control Authorities debt limit
to reflect inflation and fund
critical flood control projects.
This ensures continued
protection for Albuquerque
residents without raising taxes,
maintaining fiscal
responsibility while addressing
rising infrastructure costs.
With that, Madam Chair, I stand
for questions.
Madam Speaker.
May I also acknowledge, um,
Senator Tobiasson as my
co-sponsor.
Seeing no debate, the gentle
lady to close. I have a question
up there.
Um
Gentle lady from Bernali and
Torrance, Representative Lord.
Thank you Madam Chair, uh, with
the Representative Berlin
County, please yield. I will,
Madam Chair, something you said
definitely perked my interest.

Yes.

will it be paid?

lady from Bernalillo, um, I
believe you're from Burn Leo,
right?
Yes, uh Mr. it's Burley in
Torrance County, which County. I
thought so, um, from, uh, Berna
Leone Torrance County. Um, Madam
Speaker, and um
And uh gentle lady, the actual
what would happen is there would
be a um.
The electorate would vote on
this and it would, it would
actually um raise the, the debt.
Limit ceiling.
And that hasn't been done in
like 20 years.
Mr. Speaker Delady, can you
explain that to me about raising
the debt ceiling, but what you
just talked about, can you
please explain that? I'm just,
uh, madam, Madam Speaker and
gentle lady, what it would do is
it would allow the bonding
capacity.
Bonding capacity to be at a
higher limit.
OK, Mr. deli that, and you said
something, uh, we're speaking to
a lady about in Burnleyo County
or Speaker Delaney.
Yes, um, a maths, uh,
responsibility is to urino
County and the municipal uh
government of Albuquerque.
