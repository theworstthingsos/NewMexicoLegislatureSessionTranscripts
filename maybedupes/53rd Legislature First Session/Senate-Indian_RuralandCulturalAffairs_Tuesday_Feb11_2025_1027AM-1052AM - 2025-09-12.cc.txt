that's.
Advocating for this, but that's
what we're doing here with this
bill, state of New Mexico.
Um, however.
That inclusivity too.
Of a tribe
Where and it also says.
To be eligible for enrollment.
any tribe.
So
Madam Chair, this language is
the same language and it's what
we look at to determin now, um,
tribes have the right to
determine membership for having
to prove whether or not you are
a native student. Again, those
records are already on file with
our public to this.
So we expected you know if a
student checks all things
happening, you know, a lot of
these information is already
there.
Public schools also have maybe a
Native American.
I know Cleveland High School and
Cleveland High School, so it's
not like nothing is happening,
That I'm aware of at this time.

Thank you.
Madam Chan.
It's not so much uh exclusion of
reaffirmation
of our sovereign right to be who
we are when we talk about all of
this, uh we're not a race of.
We have treaties with the
federal government or, you know,
our constitution.
The federal government Congress

That's why this relationship.
And what we do, we're not

Anybody we're exerting our right
to be who we are that this
country identified from the very
beginning.
This is important, you know, to
all of us exclusionary.
It is standing up for the right

That's why
Chairman
You know, talked about the
kinks. We dealt with the king of
Spain.
We've dealt with, with
United States government.
We've been here with in the
future.
We might have 5 kings, you know,
if something happens in the

So we have been

this committee.
We'll get it at the next round

Madam, I do want to
Most of my problems thank you.
members of the committee.
I
Yeah.
Yeah, no, definitely I think
it's important
we will move on to Senate Bill
273.
Yeah
Um, thank you, Madam Chair. So,
uh, Senate Bill 273 is an
appropriations bill, uh, to go
to the veterans services
department.
And
veterans are unhoused, and how
do we help service so that they
can get medical care, uh,
behavioral health cares until
they can get their feet
Madam Chair,
committee members, uh, thank you
for allowing me to Albuquerque.
and
have this service but have to
come to Albuquerque to do that.
Uh, these funds, uh.
that,
um, the, the vic used to
professionally called the big,
uh, from 2005 to 2000 as
governor, uh, we've been
Uh, or since 2018, I guess
that's.
So
Um, really, the problem is that
we need statewide, um, also the
VA program, the grant per diem
program really funds the bare
minimum enhanced uh more than
the minimum that is.
the
Some alternative types of
therapy and art therapy, pet
therapy for the veterans there
to try to design the program
more local fun as they uh
oftentimes want to stay in their
local communities don't want to
go a way for us to outreach to
those that are welcoming to them
in our facade.
Um, all right, so I just didn't
support uh.
That's it.
Madam Chair, members of the
kitty.
Excuse me, the committee, my
name is James Verra. I'm a
Native American veteran of 12
years and and I support this
bill wholeheartedly. Um, I was
looking at some national stats.
Uh, just, um,
That this report was is not even
a month old and and uh and, and
these numbers are from 2022,
however, um, on a daily.
Bass, there's 132 suicides in
America and almost 18 of those
are of veterans, uh, it doesn't
have any stats on how many are
Native.
But you know, as, as it was
pointed out, you, you know, you
go to homeless camps and you'll
find Native American veterans
that are.
Um, in those camps, um, Native
Americans and I just want to
tell you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee, this
would be a great anchor.
And hopefully this could, you
know, be a uh a model program
for other states, um.
You know, um, if I was to, uh,
you know, be in a situation
where I would need the services,
um, I would like to thank
Senator Sharon and this young
man here for.
But you know, bring, bringing
this to the table. However, I'd
be uh last in line to to receive
services, and that's how much I
support and love, um, the men
and women that I uh fought with
and uh.
I think it.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the Veteran Services and the
Department of the attributes
that this bill offers.
Thank you
we have
Walter
Yes, uh, good morning, madam
Chair and members of the
committee. My name is Walter
Borton. I'm a US Navy vet and a
member of the Veterans and
Military Families Caucus, a
caucus of more than 560 members.
Aris in support of Senate Bill
273.
Some years ago I was board chair
of a small volunteer agency in
Santa Fe, providing support to
individuals who are at risk,
homeless, or near homeless.
A group called Made indeed.
I was often directly involved as
a mentor in assisting
individuals through the
transition from homelessness to
temporary housing and ultimately
to stable housing.
It was my experience at the
support, counseling and
resources needed to succeed with
this transition frequently we're
not readily accessible to our
clients.
When we could find and provide
meaningful transitional support,
our clients were much more
likely to make a successful and
permanent transition.
In fact, one of the fellows I
mentored, a brilliant.
Has worked as a legislative
assistant for the New Mexico
State legislature since those
days.
And I live in San Miguel County
in Villanueva and here in rural
New Mexico support for this
difficult transition from
homelessness to a secure home is
even harder to access, and this
bill is a much needed step in
the right direction.
We at the caucus urge you to
vote in favor of passage of
Senate Bill 273. Thank you very
much for allowing me to testify.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Maria Grego and I'm with
the New Mexico Center on Law and
Poverty, and we thank the
sponsors for this bill.
So we stand in support of this
bill because New Mexico's
veterans should have access to
long-term stable and affordable
housing.
Uh, the proposed appropriation
represents a modest yet
impactful investment in New
Mexico's veterans, um, in our
state, veterans constitute
approximately 9% of our
population, with around 3500
veterans experiencing
homelessness or near
homelessness. This is a
significant concern given that
veterans are more than twice as
likely to have a disability
compared to non-veterans, uh,
with 31.5% of veterans reporting
a disability.
Um, investing in transitional
housing not only addresses
immediate shelter needs, but
also offers comprehensive
support services, including case
management, um, employment
assistance and mental health
services. Uh, this approach
ensures that veterans can
successfully reintegrate into
civilian life and maintain
long-term housing stability. Uh,
by allocating these funds
requested in this bill, uh, we
can honor our veterans and
ensure that they have the
essential housing support they
need. For these reasons, we
strongly urge the committee to
pass.
this important piece of
legislation. Thank you.
Thank you, Marianne. Now we
have.
Um, good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee,
sponsors, um, my name is Nadine.
I am a person with multiple
disabilities and I'm a
disability advocate and I am not
a lobbyist in the interest of
the brevity of time and your
other deadlines, I think that
the other
commentaries have been
supportive of Senate Bill 273
and I stand in support of the
bill. Thank you very much for
your time and your dedication.
Thank you.
