Good morning everyone. We
apologize for the late
start to committee's
Committee.
Uh So we have a staff
recommendations.
Uh Senate Bill 249
through 255
as either Germane or Jermaine
with a
message.
If there's no
issues with those,
I will accept
a motion.
Thank you, Senator
Duhe, Senator
Padilla was eating his
muffin.
Apparently we can have
these muffins.
All right, any opposition
to that motion,
uh seeing none.
Uh We've done
that. We're about to
end.
Yeah.
Uh so, uh
you notice that we have the
message, the bills
that need a message
and then we have two question marks
at the end. So I'll turn
it over to Sanders to explain
why they're in the question
mark.
>> Um Thank you madam Chair and
Senators. Um These,
these two bills
um, create a new program
and include a fund as
well as an appropriation.
Um In the past, you've had conversations
about um
simple funds being
germane. Um But
this is a more substantive
program and so we wanted
you all to take a look at that
um, because of that
substance. Thank
you.
>> Right. Any comments or
questions about
those
Senator Duh,
>> I'm I'm, I'm trying to
bring up 264 but
I was just looking at
250
seems like a lot of
substantive stuff in
addition to
>> that's what she
said.
>> Assuming that the,
yeah,
assuming this other one, my computer's
being weird is the
same. I
mean, they are not
your.
>> So, uh, I'll
accept a motion on
those
two.
Any questions about
that, any
opposition to
the two bottom
bills which
are significant into
our needing a message
seeing no opposition.
We've done that also.
So, uh, Senator
Baca,
>> we done with that motion once
we're done with that motion. I have,
>> we are, we are done.
>> Um, I have Senate Bill
64 that we looked
at early on.
Um, we've seem to
have adjusted
exactly how we're treating
some of these tax
bills. Uh, this
was, uh, the
title is relating to
taxation and
it has to do
with the production
compliance,
um,
se severance tax
for natural gas
if you'll recall that
bill.
And just based on, based
on our, some
of our previous discussions
that we've had following
this bill. I,
I
it's my position that this,
this impacts
revenue and is therefore
now germane
under our latest
measures, I would
say.
>> All right now that you've
quickly glanced at it.
Any other comments,
Senator >> Worth, so madam
Chair, I, I agree. I think we
kind of changed how we were
doing this. And I think with
the tax credits
again, you just don't want, the
analysis is different than the
appropriations bills where there's a new
program. I mean, this clearly
impacts
revenues.
>> All right, Senator Bucket, you want to
make a motion?
>> I mov'e that we deem Senate
Bill 64
German. >> Any
other comments
about that questions
about it? Any
opposition to that
motion? Seeing
none, we've added Senate
Bill 64 onto
our Germanin. Anything
else to come before the
Committee? Seeing
none? We are in recess. Thank
you so much for being so flexible.
