Thank you thank you Mr.
Good morning Mr chair good
morning committee members
J. I am presenting
House Energy Environment and
natural resources committee
substitute for house bill two
forty three.
The.
Two two number is point at two
two five two seven four point
two.
Is.
Sorry.
Two two five seven four point
two.
Yes and there is
The committee for special.
so the.
Thank you Mr chair
This this bill would modify
chapter sixty two electric gas
and water utilities article
eight duties and restrictions
imposed upon public utilities
require the PRC to open a
rulemaking on distribution grid
modernization plans.
As you can.
Mr chair the grimoires
modernization act twenty twenty
which that was that H. B. two
thirty three task energy
minerals and in natural
resources at Department with
drafting a roadmap for grid
modernization in response to the
act's directive EMNRD convened a
grid modernization advisory
group for series of eight
workshops from September to
December twenty twenty two I'm
sorry twenty twenty.
The members of the advisory
group included over forty
electric sector representatives
scientists working at national
labs academics renewable energy
experts environmental and
consumer advocates.
Advocacy group produced a series
of white papers January twenty
twenty one.
What number six is on
distribution resource planning
and they were they recommended
the following action.
To require utility distribution
system plans to be submitted to
the New Mexico public regulation
commission at three year
intervals the regional HB two
thirty three establish that
utilities may file create more
modification projects.
What public utility may file an
application with the PRC to
prove grid modernization.
And that the PRC may also
request projects.
This bill takes their my bill
today Mr chair takes original
two thirty three and adds a
concrete requirements for filing
the grid modernization which are
the plans it also preserves the
PRC rulemaking framework by
letting the PRC to side with the
grid mod plan would include.
And with that I'd like to have
my expert witness to introduce
themselves.
The gentleman leading us on.
serve as an expert witness to
Representative are today.
In my name is Jim Mitchell I'm a
constituent of Representative
Lujan and also energy economists
experts in I. R. P. and of most
things distribution planning.
With that Mr chair we will stand
for questions.
That
is.
So
this is
This
is a
huge
To
This is here in the last.
Yeah.
Thank you Mr chairman members of
the committee my name's up under
its belt is.
I'm executive director of the
organization publishing which
United basically.
Grassroots citizen consumer
oriented.
Organization I have partaken in
them.
Medications regarding consumer
advocacy many many years
has a lot to do with the
creation of the public
regulation commission
I might add
We're concerned about the grid
mop modernization plan.
We're concerned.
Mostly that there has not been
enough studies done.
Regarding
the affects of radio activity
and that.
This is a very serious concern.
Right you activity obviously is
something that hurts are are
people who'd communities.
Especially I'd like to speak in
in behalf or to bring to light.
People that live in apartment
complexes where there is
A massive amount of metres all
in one place and the amount of
radiation that could possibly in
be omitted from those meters.
I don't think there's been
enough studies done to really.
Thank you for coming okay thank
you I just don't I think there
needs to be more studies done
regarding the to radiation.
The other is in the interest of
time you just sort of I.
Mr chairman members of the
committee good morning how do
you do my name is Kathy Burke of
Albuquerque I represent New
Mexicans for your utility safety
and association of citizens
statewide with very serious
concerns about the dangers of RF
radiation emitted and omitted
from smart meters these dangers
sometimes are lethal
resulting from very serious
illness and death to both human
beings and to other living
creatures including plants and
animals constituting Our
Environment.
the president of New Mexicans
for utility safety is with us
today he is a world renowned
expert our research scientist on
EMF radiation
particularly RF radiation which
is the concern with smart meters
he's with us here today you'll
hear from him.
Canada has an application for
smart meters presently before
the PRC.
New Mexicans for utility safety
is being prohibited our
organizations being prohibited
from introducing environment or
health concerns at the PRC
hearing.
Our witnesses are being
prohibited from speaking this
would just have have been
excluded by the hearing examiner
simply because their testimony
is about the environment and
about health and public safety.
All their testimonies have been
stricken from this PRC case thus
far.
Additional intervenors also have
been denied because their issues
are about the health of the
apartment thank you.
Thank you chairman.
We are gonna say about five
minutes for people online but
please proceed.
I'll try do with that like.
Of.
All right the at services all of
this Sir if you stand you might
build project.
You already answered.
One person writes
I.

All
right all of our This appears
while he was the first case that
the rights all the actions you
set this year with the rise for
eighty one percent eight point

years or.
That is if you

appears to have

next to this morning with almost
blind servers with that

the RC has received hundreds of
reports like these bills as.
At kilo.
Copy this is our reserve thank
you Sir.
Next step.
Lou of time I can't go into all
that but plausible talks hit
risk of intensive pulse
microwave smart metering they
admit is minute as many as
fourteen thousand short bursts
of intense microwave radiation a
day disrupting body cellular
electro chemistry and causing
health symptoms of migraine to
tinnitus insomnia dizziness
vertigo anxiety and chest pain
palpitations and memory loss I
travel to North Carolina last
August to a friend's funeral
North Carolina has smart meters
on every building in the state
the end that I stayed in have a
smart meter I could not sleep my
tinnitus was exacerbated to the
point I couldn't get any rest I
returned to New Mexico it has
somewhat subsided but my
tinnitus has never completely
gone back to where it was before
in a very low Tate low tone that
didn't bother me as much as it
does now thank you you have.
He's.
Mr chairman members of the
committee I was one of the
people who spoke against the
smart meters AT the PRC and
there were a humongous amount of
people I don't remember what
year that was it seems like
about five or six years ago but
honestly I do not know I just
know it was crowded and we all
spoke and now they don't want us
to speak I know someone who used
to work for a renowned doctor
who lived here and he has these
people sleeping in cages they're
called there I do cages F. A. R.
A. D. A. required for their very
health all the elderly that
would go into the homes would
all die immediately.
Thank you so we've talked for a
few more I I do want to people
as well.
Mr chair members of the
committee my name is Chelsea
Canada and I'm the director of
public policy at the New Mexico
chamber of commerce we
respectfully oppose H. B. two
four three we did not see the
committee substitute this bill
also these comments are based
off of the original bill posted
online The New Mexico chamber of
commerce does not support
legislation that creates more
certainty within our current
regulatory structure for
industry especially ones we rely
on for basic energy needs a few
years ago stakeholders were
included in crafting the
original version of this bill
and we need we believe there
needs to be an opportunity to
see how projects progress under
this new statute according to
the use US department of energy
the least cost best fit
approaches and economic
evaluation technique that is
applied with the need for a
particular project or investment
is already established this
measurement may be busy
misplaced because the PRC a
simultaneous simultaneously
evaluating the need during
regulatory procedures we believe
the new professional PRC should
have an opportunity to determine
what measure of instruments are
the most appropriate through
rulemaking thank you.
This issue is that.
Practice.
Did you hear what I said.
I have countless patients who
have suffered from some more
meters their symptoms are very
similar to each other it can
include ringing in the ears
headaches migraine headaches.
Insomnia is the most common
symptom I hear anxiety
A roof meus chest pain.
Digestive problems the list is
huge but many of the symptoms
they have in common with each
other.
And.
They tell me when they leave
their homes and go camping or
something.
Or go to some other place that
has no smart meters all those
symptoms disappear some of them
are so desperate they can't move
from their house so they end up
getting these leverage shared a
cage tents that they order
online that are impregnated with
silver fibers that protect them
while they're in their bed.
is terribly sad what I see the
amount of suffering that I see
that is needless suffering.
Thank you.
Mr chairman members of the
committee John McPhee are you
probably so I will Madam links
because you have my comments of
submitted to you I was a
consumer product safety
commission or for the state of
New Mexico for twenty three
years we've been working on this
issue of trying to limit and
regulate wireless of nationwide
and statewide for ten years of
in Paris Arthur here he's he's
one of the leading experts in in
the world if you read his if you
have any interest in the subject
in depth his book infinite
rainbow is the consummate of
research in the world regarding
and he knows all the major
scientists in every country I've
already checked it all out will
remit low very long time.
Yeah I do the basic thing is the
frequency of wireless is
different from the frequency of
human beings it's it's that
simple it's it's not more
complicated than that of the
Russian scientists came to
Kirtland airforce base in
Albuquerque in nineteen fifty
three to Morris and we laughed
at them but we were X. rating
fetuses a bait and and killing
newborns with X. rays I'm not
even thinking that dot Is Your
radiation which is what we use
for wireless is is dangerous at
all.
In some is now considered a
national epidemic the consumer
product safety commission
actually I mean the CDC has a of
you know partner website
dedicated to it but they're not
not allow duplicate any product
because they take money from
four hundred different
corporations we don't have
neutral money for research
anymore
my family down to seven towns in
the state the state of
responsibility with me is very
high in terms of protecting the
public I'm here as a volunteer
thank you.
It's a.
The people are standing there
just stop going online to yes
Sir.
I'm Douglas Bailey I'm from
Albuquerque I'm a member of the
New Mexicans for utility safety
and I propose House Bill.
Two forty three thank you thank
you yes.
My name is Monica Steinhoff.
And I I just I just wish I could
urge and let me listen to that
we roll back all this technology
I have had five siblings who
died of cancer in the last five
years they all use smartphones
most people in this audience are
using smartphones because they
don't know there were many books
out at the beginning about the
studies that were suppressed you
know and that and I don't trust
PNM you know first of all I I
there's a quadrant of the city
that they have have basically
you know sacrificed in order for
profit in order to get enough
wireless to the plaza and that
you know and I I took me a year
to get the kind of talk to the
PRC they finally came out and
they blatantly lied they set a
hundred milligauss is nothing
that's absurd if you go to if
you go to the on the computer
which everybody uses including
me it's the the the always says
two point five millimeters is
all that should be in a in a
house or building where people
are that I watched for two years
I broke both my wrists while I
was there because because the
magnetism which is different
from violence but it's been
known a long time causes
leukemia causes your bones to
not be as strong anymore I've
been out of there now for two
years I have fallen off my
bicycle many times I broke in
nothing but I just you know if
we should just scale this all
back it up with people don't
know everyone is ignorant about
that everyone uses a smartphone
everyone's depend on everyone of
my nine children have the okay
but I want you to listen.
so we can do three D. three
people online of.
If you would like to speak in
opposition to this bill please
raise your hand if you're you're
speaking support to the lower
your hand so we'll take three
first up Catherine rules.
Yes morning I'd like to of state
my name's Katherine rule thank
you I am a lawyer scientist and
I would like to committee to
know that I am opposed to H. P.
to forty three.
I work with children and adults.
And I am very concerned.
Of the MSA this exposure.
So the nurse psychiatric.
problems that already exist.
And I'm very concerned that.
People of all ages.
With the Alzheimer's dementia.
Children particularly but also
dealt with ADD which is
attention deficit disorder.
Are you concerned all the smart
read is being forced upon us.
Where we are already inundated.
With EMF exposure in the
addition of the smart
maintenance.
Being imposed upon us is not
necessary in it will be.
Great.
Harm to our animals.
She in population in New Mexico
it's already stated around the
country all kinds of problems
thank you very much.
Thank you next that we are in
the Sanchez.
Hello.
My name is Kevin Lawrence in my
wife is Arlene Sanchez.
Then she has been suffering from
EHS due to EMS the last two
years.
I'm a retired engineer I worked
for Motorola back we rolled out
cell phones.
And so we know around the fifth
generation of cell phones the
technology that we utilize is
our apparatus radio frequency
radiation they always leave that
word out but there's never been
a long term health study.
Impact of any of this
technology.
We will roll across it the fund
gentleman who literally
development technology.
Four of those five men have died
of brain cancer.
So there's enough data out there
looking at all of the
information that we have.
We know there's damaging people
it's killing people my right.
When they put a smart meter on
our house she was able to feel
that she could no longer sit
outside on our back patio
because she could feel that are
recreation literally attacking
her so she suffers from insomnia
brain fog.
Memory he has health issues with
your stomach so all of the
different symptoms that people
have mentioned so far she has
pretty much everything.
You can't live a life like that.
next up or third and final
online speaker will be Janet
wallet for TV's.
Thank you chair and committing
its present state HB twenty four
H. B. two forty three must be
noted down it has no protections
for health safety or
environment.
As a member of New Mexicans for
utility safely safety us to mend
this bill to explicitly include
protection for the public health
safety and welfare in fact in
section six two dash eight dash
thirteen NMSA nineteen seventy
eight it should be amended to
read number one.
The stores after eight
incentives programs and
expenditures are number one
should be protective of the
health public health safety and
welfare.
Then we could maybe get behind
HB two forty three unless the
word help is there it makes
smart meters mandatory
regardless of the consequences
thank you.
Thank you okay we're gonna come
back to the audience.
And if you'd like to speak they
are.
The federal service.
Good morning my name is Merriam
the nesting and with new energy
economy and I appreciate the
efforts of the sponsors and
their experts to bring and then
improve the bill I have a a
number of amendments and I have
copies for you which I will hand
out
number one the least cost.
Support I am in support but I do
have a number of amendments I
think are absolutely critical to
the bill.
And one is about least cost
least cost is not the most cost
effective among feasible
alternatives that is the current
state of the law and that is the
correct state of the law least
cost could be the cheapest and
it could also mean that the
contracting company has no
experience or choir in the
product that has ever been
installed or tried out before
least cost might be mutually
exclusive that would best fit
for the entire system so I won't
go on further but please classes
written three times in the bill
and should be changed to most
cost effective among feasible
alternatives.
Using the committee substitute I
don't think that one which is in
the.
I think it is.
You change that okay well I
didn't I'm section one B. should
add a number nine and include
health safety and public welfare
at this you would have I'm happy
to hand these out.
So this is your constant okay
I'm at section one B. should add
a line helps of to safety and
welfare section one be.
You your time's up just so
Senator news.
We've been working on the
committee substitute problem
of wealth that night and for
this rule change we're with
publishers on the website that's
not currently happening we we
have a result of problems like
this that people are looking at
the right practice bill I still
get it Senator change heard
about rules committee I heard in
my the
so I apologize for that.
next up oversee a wealth in
support on my left.
The Sir.
I just ask maybe.
Wire service to the other side.
Some of the committee rooms have
wireless mites which would be
nice.
Thank you thank you Mr chair
members of the committee my name
is Charles to sail and and I'm a
registered lobbyist with
communities that to me coalition
for clean affordable energy and
I'm speaking here in support of
the bill
the bill would require the
public Regulatory Commission to
create a rulemaking to require
The grid modernization plans be
submitted every few years
by the electric utilities I'm
very sympathetic to some of the
comments that we heard earlier
but the law already requires
that smart meters be part of the
our our greeted in New Mexico
this bill doesn't really address
that issue
so I think to to address the
issues that the the some of the
commenters to have been raising
earlier would require a
different amendment to New
Mexico statutes
it's also the case that under
most of the programs folks would
be allowed to opt out of the
smart meter program so they
would not need necessarily have
to have a smart meter installed
in their house that doesn't work
for people with apartments or or
in condominiums but at least it
it partially addresses some of
the issues thank you and I urge
the committee to pass this bill.
Thank you.
Mr chairman members of the
committee Douglas medical chart
with conservation voters New
Mexico.
Very brief for the reasons
outlined but the sponsor and but
Mr disabling conservation voters
urges that you give this bill a
due pass recommendation thank
you thank you others are you in
support.
Good morning my name is Susan
March and I'm the chair of the
Rio Grande chapter of the Sierra
Club and I'm representing are
over thirty five thousand
members and supporters of this
bill would make clear that
electric utilities need to file
Carrillo great modernization
plan that requires the PRC to
adopt rules for grid
modernization plans we support
this bill thank you thank you.
Also the audience and support
okay so we're gonna go back
online for people in support if
you'd like to speak and speak in
support of this bill these right
raise your hand if you were here
to speak in opposition please
put your hand at.
Geoff robins.
And your there you.
Actually I was not for support
I'm sorry okay.
Thank you.
I don't see anyone's hands up
online will
Representative Lujan we like to
add anything before we go to the
committee.
Mr chair I just one thing we
that came forward and in state
and and say that we are ready
for questions the committee
perfect your weapons.
Thank you for that members of
the committee and I.
I thank you Mr chair of.
Well.
General.
Your expertise or left the.
Yes I don't know what the
integrated resource planning.
Mr chair of the right.
Mr chair representative.
What.
What is the primary charge of
the public regulation commission
with respect to utilize.
Mr chair.
Mr Bosco answer.
Chair representative.
Broadly speaking the child to be
affordability and reliability of
the electric rates started
customer base in New Mexico.
Madam chair and representative.
That general George I see it is
fairly broad.
It is the subject of Madam chair
representative.
Sure.
Why use this statute the.
Madam chair and representative
unfortunately because of cutting
our it is amendment did not
reach the committee.
But it is to preserve the
original intent of HB two thirty
three which just passed back to
the on this with the same date
three years ago by the Senate
did that from the jurisdiction
and the judge of the PRC no we
did not legislate anything that
they must do but the recommended
some actions that they can do to
make the project at that time if
those projects not his plans
conform to certain of the
requirements that you set up the
assets and technologies that
would modernize the grid the
grid of the State.
But we did not do anything not
be prescribed what the PRC
should do is update jurisdiction
and we make our case and would
be mandated that we should move
forward eight o'clock at night
right in the state that was a
rate of two thirty three with
the amendments that we have
which like eighty two so it
preserving that in two five
three.
Mr chairman for bus because it
appears that you already have
the affording to.
Our secretary.
The.
Mr chair and representative do
to get trying to speed up the
process and give it some more
details and more a solid basis.
Mr chair Representative let's
look at a couple things on on
page two this.
Three of four.
Straits road.
Of.
Better Mr chair and it just
Representative a said it will be
comments the state road map was
produced by a prolonged effort
that goes into deep invite the
educators and natural resource
department at almost what the
tax forty state for those that
will deal with three four months
that that is on line and in fact
I do have a very brief synopsis
the chair of the committee
members are interested I can go
with seated points out that but.
Mr chair.
It's not.
Roadmap for that yes the.
Yes
chair and representative the PRC
had their own workshops and more
but the plant itself what the
roadmap except was produced by
and.
It's not very road that was.
Or.
Drive by this legislature
Mr chair Mr chair of.
Is it was a it was presented and
reported to.
And not adopting Mr chair.
Mr chair representative there
are eleven white papers written
on this subject matter.
Mr chair and representative.
Sure.
Garcia with respect the school
is to.
Our reserves of the
Because of
that are created by utilities
getting.
And number two sure that that
unity is not only price.
Probably that is.
The special.
It seems to me that within that
brought.
This.
Richard Pryor this year is
already consumed within that
process.
And so.
One hundred.
What we need to spell it out to.
The those charged with doing
this stuff already this program
is now what we need to mandate
the specific bang on the HSD who
already has a broad mandate.
Mr chair Representative excuse
my voice is really rough today.
Not speaking very much but
you're you're correct in this
coming coming here asking for a
type of administrative functions
to be implemented but just as we
are going to this process we're
looking at these recommendations
from all those who came together
specifically on the subject
matter this is this is a
recommendation and we want to
speed up the process
for the grid modernization act
to be enacted so to speak we
need to we feel that this is
necessary Mr chair.
Senator and but it.
I wanted to Mr Chairman
representative that yes the
commission's council brought me
in the the Ford of Philly
reliability dispatch bility.
And when you go to they're all
rules of operations you of
regulation is see that they
have.
Maybe a dozen or more specific
rules on topical areas of
operation of utilities one of
them being for instance your
integrated resource planning
that requires you to is to file
plans periodically that address
the supply side
four building reliability this
as the requirement of the demand
side of the portability and
reliability to see currently.
If you're doing well get to a
very important.
This is.
The.
Representative that was created.
I.
That was well maybe the the RC
that was.
Mr chair
I'm gonna have to send them to
the of.
Mr chair and representative not
at all due the PRC is.
Did go through an extensive as
Mr thank you noted
Process on grid modernization
they just completed at the end
of twenty twenty two.
In this is not a mandate that
all this is essentially gives
them the authority to go forward
with the rulemaking on grid
modernization and does not
specify the requirements for
that this is the denticle to
your higher P. statute passed I
believe in two thousand and five
where you gave the commission
the authority to go for with the
rulemaking on integrated
resource planning.
Zero.
Education.
We're.
We.
Thank.
Thank you Mr chair thank you
Senator that is actually
something I'm looking at in the
bill and
Would you be recommending an
amendment Mr chair.
These
Representative Nibert
We do too many steps we just a
moment apart Committee so if if
if we were to amend the bill it
would have to come back as a as
a different version.
Officers are the use of the the
right we can't we can't put the
that so I don't want to put in
the mid mid to the committee
seven are committee report.
So we would have to revise the
committee said in a vote on the
revised committees.
Mr Chairman.
Does she we.
Representative.
That I that
I really.
Thank you Mr chair thank you
representative of those we will
take that into consideration and
have we work with you on that.
Thank you Representative Nibert
Representative Townsend.
Thank you Mr chair.
Thank you representative of.
The station plans.
What.
Mr chair I will ask money expert
witness to answer.
Mr chair and representative.
It thank you included up to
committee meetings will dispatch
a committee.
So.
If I would be described electric
as exists today.
Most of the control of the
system operated extends warranty
to with the substation is yes
that the wires connected to hold
as it is what is happening there
is usually not.
Visible I did information is not
available to the system
dispatcher so this somewhat
operating on a hunch and the
doctor.
The organization mostly
addresses the issues that arise
in the distribution system not
so much of the generation of the
transmission.
Because that is where perhaps as
much as thirty percent of
resides so the technologies that
are old by the homeowners that
have any faster responses that
act independently of the great.
Those do not become good
citizens of the great as we.
Try to resort to that in other
words they cannot participate in
the great activity and they
cannot find the system operated
the information he needs to
control that.
Segre modernization
also addressing.
The representatives question
before is.
Recognizing these new
technologies to modernize the
great let it operate more
efficiently if this new better
died with power is flowing both
ways and some of the spotters
Act you order by the customers
of the.
So that kind of lays out the
framework of what great
modernization is.
Mr Chairman representative of.
Your.
Electrical background in your.
H. H. you will know.
So if you want to quantify.
The.
Not.
Require.
To.
Facilitate.
The complexities of the system
as it is today.
What would you say that is I
mean how much money will be
required at some point to get
this create.
The standard that you believe
what the function Google
dispatchable but also it.
Mr chair and representative.
That's the.
A difficult question only
because this separate components
and separate technologies that
play into this and I use one as
an example.
Of integrating organization
advisory group was convened by
the in the.
The estimated that the in light
of that glass metering
infrastructure will create any
that provide a W. to three
hundred million.
Which would like that which
would be basically advertised to
the range of about five hundred
and fifty thousand customers.
That's just one couple in it so
yes some of these expensive
technologies but at the same
time do do offer.
More widespread benefit.
Mr chair.
Other expert would like to and.
Thank you Mr Chairman
representative like to add to
that.
Distribution systems of art
three electric utilities
investor owned utilities in this
state are already constrained
and in many places subject to
lack of resilience and
reliability you may reach them
remember that about a year ago
there was a lot of concern about
public service New Mexico being
short on power this past summer
and then we could be subject to
rent to black out that wasn't a
system wide concern about losing
generation it was an issue about
certain spot would be in the
distribution system as Mr kill
speaking up and so the two of
movies are always upgrading and
spending money on this on their
distribution systems the grid
mod plans would give more of a
consensus of review and analysis
of we're expenditures and
upgrades and modifications would
best occur to all first and
foremost keep reliability and
resiliency and then secondly to
advance and integrate some
matters that Mr keel spoke of
regarding of the two way
communications and such on the
grid.
Thank you for that.
And.
Representative experts.
Bill two forty three.
Wire that the lottery station
and is implemented.
Or just presented.
That.
Mr chair and representative that
is a determination for the
commission we are not specifying
procedurally or substantively
what the plans must but the
commission to rulemaking must do
or require the two ladies the
plants could be just presented
an overview or they could be
formally.
Subject to
Of rulemaking litigated
proceeding.
Chairman and Representative and
experts with the cost of the
nation's.
The embedded in the right four
the day be additional costs and
the implementation with in those
plans the subject to rate
increases.
Mr chair and representative just
as the commission right now has
the integrated resource planning
process for the value would
supply side options generation
construction of and purchases
from other entities the cost of
those plans in the regulatory
process to review those plans is
a right making cost.
And then the cost of
implementing those plans I eat
picking a new generation
resource or a or a.
In our contract with another
entity that also goes into rates
and so you would be under the
same process here with
distribution and I would just
add that distribution costs are
being incurred regardless this
would require R. allow the
commission to going to
rulemaking to establish a more
robust planning process around
what Mr thank you described as
thirty percent the system that
right now is somewhat
obscure and and not visible to
the commission of the state so
Mr chairman and.
Representative.
What you believe that.
As we transition to the.
Conversion.
renewables that the.
Legislation I am.
With the kind of the developing
thing and ever step that you
wind up you would have to make
more changes at that is that
right in your.
Mr chair up Mr chair
Representative that is part of
the planning process of why we
have the did a great
modernization Act is to as we
are developing these renewable
energy sources did they do
become integrated into our to
the group Mr chair.
So Division chairman and
Representative.
It seems to me.
This is pretty telling and
should be.
Should.
That is concerning to me.
Mr chairman relating to that we
have been parked in the plane.
It we had no idea what the cost
is going to be.
And now we have.
Reliability issues.
We have increased costs.
We are just we just keep adding
these along a little bit of time
with you know don't worry it's
just a few here and there and
before long we're talking about
real money for New Mexicans.
Is that you of Representative Mr
chair Mr chair
Senate from understanding what
you're getting out with your
question is is that your we have
a concern that as we are
developing the good monetization
Act in the planning of it that
is going to be there's going to
be more cost involved with the
with the planning and as.
As mentioned with my expert
witnesses that that is already
part of the process that we are
engaging with anything we do
that with the grid as it is and
I would just add that we are in
the modernization plan as we are
investing in our economy is
growing with renewable energy
resources this has to be part of
the plan here has to be part
considered whether we infer or
cost at first as we do with any
kind of developing project that
remains to be seen at what that
would level would be but the end
result is what we're we're
driving at and and then getting
to where we need to be without
modernization plan Mr chair
okay.
Gentlelady appreciate bills
for it because I've never really
thought about.
This continuing.
To continue to modernize the.
Every time we make the steps.
And I think the people of New
Mexico Mr chairman and gentle
lady should now be concerned
about what the future cost of
electricity is New Mexico.
Because.
The
Gen three.
Is going to be.
It is an upward trajectory I
think we all can agree on that.
Hi it goes and and that's
because of the concern right and
then I have your expert and
friend of mine and tells me that
there's reliability issues and
I'm I'm getting a little child
that
industry and jobs in New Mexico
it depends on affordable.
Reliable power.
We really have a lot we have to
address and your bill is trying
to pick that up in the address
of the for the for Mr.
Mr chair Representative I I
agree we're trying to put in
planning and process so that we
can address those issues earlier
rather than later and as
mentioned before we we are this
is it this is a huge planning
effort and we have EMNRD themed
leading on this as we we given
the charge.
And this is taking all efforts
across.
Federal levels down to our local
levels and how we are addressing
and come together to understand
what those with this will all
incur I think my experts would
like to add to that.
Mr chair and representative I
make that a few more points.
Date is actually to prove the
reliability and resiliency of
the great fight great
organization not the proper
place and it would be co
provides because but the other
aspect that you included to us
on the scope together.
So we this would happen is some
of these technologies cannot be
combined and rode out the state.
The ability of these
instabilities at this is.
An evolution of the great that
we have to accept and this and
that aspect of rate design the
PRC that sitters.
Usually the benefit to the what
they do is did you why did eight
years in different classes so if
there is a benefit that goes to
a certain class for the day that
the cost of that upgrade it
doesn't rule out to everybody
and this is actually to put two
and the location of the speech
two thirty three they be
excluded and it specifically
recognized that the budget state
approved of certain group of it
years with only the judge but
those are those will be made the
mute those rate increases.
Well Mr chair and.
Representative.
Thank you very much.
Do you believe that the.
Complications.
Is the exacerbated in the larger
metropolitan areas just because
of their size and in the bottom
part that they are consuming and
maybe producing.
Or it is important in local New
Mexico as it is to Albuquerque
New Mexico.
Mr chair
Representative we don't believe
that that would be the case but
I as I as I perceive it but I I
will defer to my experts if you
would.
Mr chair representative I'd like
to add that.
Organization is specially used
for but the group and what
communities Mexico because right
now do not have the kind of
residency or even critical life
support functions.
So this specifically allows them
a greater degree of resiliency.
And recovery in case of disaster
or even set this up we should
see this so desire and the
infrastructure reduction back
positive for sizes that it is
targeting low income and rural
communities so that date are
fully supported by these new
technologies becoming about.
Representative and.
Share.
What I'm gathering from this.
Is that what we have done.
Compromise the stability in the
affordability of are greeted.
For me technology.
That we want to embrace.
But we don't know what the cost
is yes.
We don't know yet how to make it
reliable.
Mr chair Mr chair Representative
I think I would agree on and in
those points and and again
give some reflection on why we
have the grid modernization act
in place I think you're we're on
the same page.
of why we needed and how we need
to integrate move towards new
technologies.
Share it I don't think we're on
the same page I think we have
identified the same problem okay
thank you Mr.
I would created the dark
problems.
In the beginning.
What I'm what I'm saying.
Representative is that we have
charter stated.
Not knowing where we were going.
This bill.
Is an effort to get us back on
track for affordability and
sustainability and reliability
that New Mexicans no longer
have.
And that is a problem.
I think so Mexicans are
connected to.
Thank you Mr chair thank you
thank you Mr chair
representative got.
You several additions this is.
Too many cooks in the kitchen.
Chair yes I have.
Your
year's.
The legislature.
It's.
Which.
All the all the rich.
Representative.
But Wall.
Two tickets.
Which is which previous
legislation or what.
And they asked me.
To us.
One.
Previous.
Ruched
legislation what a whole out.
Opportunity.
To.
Cheap the object.
So Mr Chairman representative
that is my question.
To you.
What
is our previous legislation.
It
PRC.
Now we.
Mr chair
I think we're we're making the
statement again that we were
looking at the planning and
moving and moving the process
along.
In a faster way interesting news
issues as as mentioned this is
this multi functional
and I I understand your concerns
and we come from or all the
pieces of the together as we are
moving toward a new PRC and we
have any PRC place actually but
I'm gonna ask my with these
expert would deceive to add to
that.
Mr chair and representative
I'm glad you brought that the
issue of any cokes so we have
actually reduced number of books
at the PRC for five to three.
And they are.
The best of my knowledge the at
eight feet of expertise in
organization.
one of the Mexico should set in
that and looks into the
modernization group and has done
so for the last thirty years.
the other two permissions Office
of the Medical.
really the intent here is if you
recall H. B. two thirty two
installation of bills that was
passed in twenty twenty I only
projects to be I the commission
and what the attic lighting now
is not a project but of the
plan.
By the commission and the
commission can do that would
make a.
What the metric should be used
for that city spots foster
Bective the state what it would
do want to.
As the evaluation criteria for
this plan is left up at that.
And the point was made would be
about one of the supporters was
response for pasta thank you
this may not be the right
metrics because some of these
technologies that that
introduced by David what is the
shin.
I don't think that will.
So if you do nearly of cost
effectiveness yes on those they
may not qualify that is being
built through marketing and to
other data to wider benefits
exist we just cannot monetize
that stuff.
Is that sequences.
Mr chairman Mr table shorter
doesn't.
Because our.
You yes it is.
In the legislature to.
Fishing which were all.
If you will thank you so much.
So.
Mr Chairman the ticket was your
opinion.
That the location she plans.
For
issue the.
Research with this.
From.
So.
Electricity providers.
Yes.
Piece of legislation seeks to.
That process all.
Mr chair and representative
actually you've actually hit the
nail on the head.
I use the PNM let as an example
the first stage is to be
completed six years.
And the final implementation of
the plan rules after eight
years.
thanks so.
But there are reasons that
providers which may be
justifiable but this this effort
this year lead that along more
strictly thank you for this is
because these technologies that
will be all.
Commercialization of these
technologies is happening eight
customers I need to be adopted
they take advantage of the
benefits so it behooves us to
think by the PRC.
Were swiftly but these plans at
a look at it for
so that they can be able to make
a the equity.
If you.
Mr chair of maybe maybe we had.
Mr Chairman representative just
a quick clarification there are
no grid modernization plans
filed with the commission at
this time or.
Slated to occur.
What.
Mr kill referenced is a.
Application filed by PNM that
addresses components of a grid
modernization plan as directed
by the commission March twenty
twenty two to address
reliability and.
The distribution failures
potential distribution failures
so this would establish
comprehensive plans on the
distribution or demand side just
as you now have.
The requirement for
comprehensive plans on the
supply side generation purchase
panel.
Mr Chairman representative
experts are only.
With this.
We just need to use change.
Pretty significant contribution
maybe the whole.
Well Judiciary no increased cost
of the.
So.
The
only issue she will.
Mr Chairman.
Representative give me a call.
We
need to mop.
What.
Mr Chairman Mr king it would be
your opinion we all need to
work.
State to live he's.
The complexities.
We're not moving forward.
But it is considered.
Representative.
Mr chair and representative.
Right now all the liability of
the system's actually boarded
the act forty eight by the
utilities to the PSC.
And it does we some national
secretary.
There are certain areas with the
liability like the service do
duration at this so aside with
the interruption of service of
the duration and frequency may
be higher but does a pockets
it's not system wide.
So I don't think it's fair to
say that we have a less reliable
system.
What lodges that are coming in
which allow for a creation of.
There is in the system that will
enhance the reliability.
Overall of the great.
Mr chair which we care we work.
So she.
So yes Mr chair representative
and can do the change is that
fifty conduct a significant part
of the generation of the system.
It is.
Which is basically taking us at
a.
You know we have to make sure
that the tech is a replaced by
the will be our border live
generation sources.
And management.
Mr Chairman.
Representative pivotal
constraints this legislature.
Yes.
Also.
Whether we.
Your locations.
Which each.
For plans.
Thank you.
Thank.
Thank you Representative Dixon.
Thank you Mr chair thank you
Representative Lujan and.
Senator.
Mr kids
I.
Actually wanted to propose
an amendment I have however
yeah.
Given that it's this may be
substitute it may make more
sense to potentially incorporate
and then that but what I wanted
to talk about was
Mr chair and representative on
page one line twenty four.
Change that.
Shall to may.
And then
removing.
Electric public utilities.
and that's in line.
Then
Mr chair representative
the H. two.
These striking wind one and two.
And then online three.
the straight managers and
putting that in there I guess
how the plans.
Chair and resented.
It would we.
Strand.
One one twenty three a great
modernization plan may include
measures of cost effective.
modernization and may include
measures cost effectiveness and
realize the distribution.
And how the plans are consistent
with the state's roadmap for
grid modernization.
Is.
Mr chair.
Representative.
This.
As noted earlier to work with
Representative Nibert I think on
the same page two seem to
portion would happily
Work that into and then for the
next committee Mr chair.
So on that point Representative
if you are suggesting an
amendment we asked to be done in
this committee.
Okay so Mister chair just so my
my point is if you're saying
your M. and in the next
committee there were not in the
past this.
Understand.
So for for for for clarification
then we would if there is a
Committee amendment to the
substance substitute bill then
we.
Can you clarify that one more
time yes
Representative because it is the
House Energy Environment and
natural resources to do we don't
want to have the housing
department this resources
committee report and then there
are substitute.
So what we would do is you would
come up with a new committee
steps to get back and we with
that limited discussion on just
the change.
Understood Mr chair thank you.
These at all thank you Mr chair
yes that.
Okay thank you Mr chair
Concerns in the in the past
couple years as as
Representative Scott mentioned.
That.
The job of the PRC.
Has been.
Updated has been.
Criticized his hat as was stated
the of course the legislature
and the governor involved to the
point where
we went away from a L. lactic P.
Garcia.
To an appointed PRC and partake.
Politics out of it some of the
qualifications for the PRC Mr Mr
chair
what are you you're pretty far
afield you come I'm coming back
to a there's a point.
So the.
There has been a lot disruption.
And.
There was
Instructions given the PRC when
they were.
elected to make some of these
changes that the new P. Garcia.
Really just.
Coming to being.
And what we're doing here is
more of the same.
Where we're saying you just got
here we are not doing enough.
and it's not fast enough for us
so once again Mr chairman and
and Representative the
frustration I have here is we
thought some of this would go
away.
By moving instructions
benefactors bipartisan support
to go this direction.
And.
Rather than allow that to play
out even a even a full year.
Mr Chairman.
what we're doing is saying.
Okay now do it this way and I'm
just Miss Mister chairman I'm
not sure that even though we've
raised the qualifications so we
would have hopefully more of it
technocrat.
PRC rather than a.
Political.
Body.
Now what tell the technocrats
okay we we we're we're we're
saying we're not the experts and
obviously when you run somebody
through the political process
you might have somebody is not
an expert in in any way.
Running in being elected but we
want to make sure that good
decisions are being made prudent
decisions are being made.
And.
And we want to keep politics out
of it and allow the technocrats
to make decisions absent
politics.
It is Mr chairman I would just
ask is it and and maybe.
Representative again and Mr Kim
and Mr kills I I believe that
was the discussion we have to
the to to to to go in this
direction.
do you do we not see this as
more of meddling and.
Are the experts.
Chairman.
The Mr Chairman Representative I
appreciate your.
Your analysis and where you're
going with you're talking about
over the bit that we're doing
here is we're we're looking at
the whole of the plan in wanting
to know that information for the
PRC perspective with all their
knowledge integrity and we are
with the representative and
report those.
Technological mindset so to
speak we're what we're seeing
right now is it we don't just
want to focus on the project we
want to look at those plans will
give you that direction directed
Mr chair.
So Mr chairman and
representative if you're gonna
come back with a
in other committee substitute if
you know if you're because we're
not gonna go to this we're gonna
come back with another committee
substitute the real problem I
have with this.
More than everything else that
has been discussed here is on
page two I'd be.
Which is we're saying by October
one twenty twenty four.
Were pre presuming.
Mr Chairman.
That we know when the state
needs to be done by and if they
can get that done by that time.
And I would just say Mr
chairman.
Representative is that.
That that is what we need to
leave to to the people who have
to get it right.
there's some reporting that is
being asked here and we're we're
we're both kind of skirting
around the edge of whether it's
public utility or who it is that
we want to put these elements of
the report two one fixing but in
reality the problem I have.
Is that we're telling them they
have to have it by a date
certain.
Which may or may not be the
right date.
And so if if I would cities
suggests Mr chairman
representative.
For for me to support this.
I would like to see that see
that open ended support for.
More time because we don't know.
We don't know if.
We make that decision by October
first twenty twenty four there's
better technology.
That comes out.
That is my suggestion I don't
know that I'm not even asking
whether or not that's for them
just so as making the state Mr
chairman that if I'm in support
this I think that's really what
it would like to see just to
make sure we don't we don't put
artificial date in.
Thank you Mr chair thank you
representative Representative at
this time will.
Will know that I'm not
completely sure that that is
something we we we would agree
upon that we can we can talk
about that.
Thank you representative Lente a
representative Borrego.
Share in the Representative
thank you for bringing this
forward
I do want to say.
they do agree with the comments
made.
Representative just texted Mr
chair of the the.
Probably help with regard to
this you know making a little
bit better
and I and I think Representative
Montoya also has a good point
earlier your witness mention
that no one has filed a
modernization plan and in fact
that's not true
Has filed a modernization plan
PRC and.
They want to some of them for
you.
Your amended version of
this
of this act
the other thing Mr chair
representative is they do I am
concerned.
As I used to work in
telecommunications and.
Or
you I am concerned with how
rural and and this may actually
promote.
You know if the structure in the
future but I think I am
concerned with how our rural
communities.
How they would receive.
You know this type of
modernization I know that in
fact many of those don't have
the structure and so I guess
that plan hopefully Mr chair and
representative for those plans
should address some of them.
and you may want to consider.
It needs to be included in here
but I think it needs to be at
the whole process because you
know places like Albuquerque
modernization is probably
simpler than somewhere like what
or.
Somewhere down south of that
does not have the infrastructure
in place so I think that that is
something that we need to
consider Mr chair is how
different communities are going
to be affected.
So thank you for that Mr chair
appreciate the time and thank
you Representative read this
story Mr chairman I respond to.
State response and I mean this
for so you'll have chance closed
Representative got up for second
time.
Usually.
Regions chairman thank you Gail
change asked.
Sure can you do to reduce
education forms have I.
Which is contradictory to the
yes.
The school.
The committee thank you the
couple questions myself
First off the the roadmap that
we've discussed that was
prepared at the direction of the
legislature is that correct such
as we passed legislation telling
them to undertake that efforts
it's not quite a rulemaking but
it's it's always possible
so that resources are going back
to that so that's not have
planned I think the legislature
normally adopts and something
like that and that the deal but
we did ask for to be fair.
Representative the different
concerns expressed about policy
the welfare of with health
safety where Paul third be taken
into consideration in the
rulemaking process.
Mr chair
It is my belief that that that
through the process and the
public comment and and and there
this has been taken up with the
PPRC and I believe that's the
proper place for that to be
taken out.
Okay and
Representative on to the.
was provided to the used to
carry out actually.
it.
Out of the meeting many
different things
would that word be defined as
far the rulemaking process.
This
is.
Issues.
Mr chair and being told that
that is the same word that is
used in the higher rate.
Prices start to.
I'm sorry and is that in the
words that you.
The process is very of the
issues.
Resource planning.
Periodically is to find and use
their search is to find in there
too much Mr chair Senator your
I. R. P. statute specifies that
the commission shall
periodically file.
Higher P. plans and so we are
this language directly from the
I. R. P. statute and then the
commission as part of the R. P.
rulemaking established a
schedule for the integrated
resource plan filings and they
would do the same thing here was
great modernization plans so we
need to be specified as part of
the rule making process as well
as after so you know I I think
It is involving in needs of all
rescue mortgage not just as more
customers from online but as the
chair of use changes
we see services in Houston at
certain times the representative
that's favorite doctors we need
to address that we we are the
leading towards electrification
I think it's reasonable for the
legislature to direct your C.
however it's constituted
to be proactive and modernizing.
so I I appreciate.
Appreciate this bill
Representative the one.
Would you like to.
Mr chair at this time I'd like
to.
Except
the the amendment it's been past
okay so the so what we'll do
what we'll do is roll the bill
and a lot of things have you
come back with a revised
Committee so
you know with this amendments I
would suggest talking to the
members that.
Suggested that I think.
We we do have a you know the
language Representative I've
heard suggested I think
conflicts with the language
Representative Dixon suggested.
And then if.
Get that worked out will bring
back for a short discussion of
the changes if we do pre back we
will.
Allowed to further public
testimony we just discussed
changes some.
Thank you Mr chair at the time
the committee today thank you.
Another bill representatives

To spot to begin with.
Thank you Mr chair and and thank

really directly affect us

of providing residents with
reliable power so we support the
bill thank you.
Anyone else online and support
please raise your hand.
Okay we're gonna do opposition
for some good audience featuring
in the.
Like to speak in opposition to
come up with.
Thank you madam Mr chair members
of the committee and Tammy
people card with southwest
energy efficiency project and we
respectfully oppose this bill
you know the number of cities
and counties in our region in
our state that have climate
plans and climate action plans
is growing every day and almost
every single climate action plan
I've seen includes provisions
for zero energy homes and a
gradual move away from fossil
fuels buildings are responsible
for forty percent of the
emissions and our country and so
buildings are a really good
opportunity to reduce our use of
fossil fuels and really what
this bill is saying is that we
can't have local control over
what we do in our communities
and and our local governments
absolutely need to maintain the
right to have whatever policies
and programs in place that
better suits their needs for
their constituents a few things
of this bill would leave local
governments without the
opportunity to do and these are
very important policy issues
that we should be able to do we
should have the right to have
local building codes that are
all electric released electric
ready and that would not be
allowed for new buildings or for
retrofit buildings we also would
be able to do incentives for all
electric in field work and
lastly and most importantly to
me is we would be able to do
incentives and policies that
require all electric
redevelopment for affordable
housing and it's really
important we not leave our most
vulnerable citizens paying those
high gas prices in the end when
all the rest of us have move to
fully electric so for all those
reasons we ask you to please not
support this bill thank you.
You Mr chairman members of the
committee Douglas Mikel jun I'm
a lobbyist for conservation
voters New Mexico we are
concerned about the ability of
local jurisdictions to address
climate change by the means that
they deem appropriate and we
believe that this bill would
interfere with that right we
therefore urge the two.
Both a do not pass on this bill
and I apologize to the sponsor
for not informing him prior to
this hearing about over
opposition to the bill very
sorry about that.
Mr chairman members of the
committee I'm Susan March and
the chair of the Rio Grande
chapter of the Sierra Club and
are we in our thirty five
thousand members and supporters
stand in opposition to this
legislation cities and their
residents are big consumers of
energy and have a right to ask
the consumer the utilities that
serve them provide energy
generated in the ways that they
would like Albuquerque is that
renewable targets for its
operations and they work with
PNM to meet those requirements
just like they have with
Facebook the legislature should
not preempt our local
governments from helping to move
utility service off natural gas
towards renewable energy sources
thank you.
Okay we're gonna go online if
you'd like to speak in
opposition to work for the one
trees here and
It Randal Keith like I believe
Mr Lang your hand we try to
recognize you before is that
correct.
Mr right.
Okay Mister Lang I I apologize
we still cannot hear you.
Okay let's we have to move on to
the ball into.
Thank you Mr chairman this is JD
Bullington on the register
lobbyist for the City of Santa
Fe which respectfully opposes
house bill four thirty one for
the following reasons
the City of Santa Fe is a very
progressive city when it comes
to developing climate action
plans developing zero emissions
policies and it's very very
outspoken on the subject of
renewable energy and it's
unnecessary to put in statute
and frankly the city feels
inappropriate to put in the
state law.
Our rules like this that would
prohibit the city from making
decisions about the type of
power that it wants to purchase
and to provide to its citizens.
The generation of electricity is
no longer firmly in the hands of
the utilities anyone can
generate electricity right now
and the city strongly supports
distributed retail generation it
supports local aggregate choice
and this statute would be
completely counter to the
direction that Santa Fe and
other municipalities that that
believes strongly in only one
hundred percent renewable energy
sources in the very near future
so it's for those reasons that
the city respectfully opposes
this legislation thank you.
Thank you next up we have
Charles good marker.
Thank you Mr chairman members of
the committee on Charles the
marker speaking on behalf after
the Energy sea Act informed to
urge your opposition to this
bill is that a stable core and
JT fortunes stated very clearly
this bill is a direct attack on
the principle of control you
know if you're our work you can
Kerry wanted to.
A past
buildings deployed one
convenience.
All to get more.
sorry just urging your
opposition to thank you.
Okay I think that's it
this you like at anything before
we get to the.
Mr chairman I would like to can
in all committee we all want to
their water which we all know
that.
But will
this to almost all of all.
People fortunate or in property
could approach to the proper
level and we won't know about
it.
The people I think we should
review for the leaders for
whatever but one of the mother
and that
What will New Mexico what do
this up.
Thank you.
Mr chair members of the
committee.
we're not we're not trying to
stop any kind of movie with any
particular cities or anything
we're just asking them to work
closer with the state so that we
don't have any big surprises
come through the pipeline and
and.
And disrupt the.
The.
Fuel
deliveries to different people
in different set up that they
have like when you look at rural
communities farms and ranches.
dairies like like at the very
where I worked we had a diesel
motor.
In case the electricity went out
in the store.
We had a diesel generator we
have propane heaters to keep
paid to the calluses that we
could have the cals we're we're
the wouldn't freeze when they're
coming into the mill partners
and and that's what this bill is
looking at is being able to have
a diversity of fuels.
So that agriculture other
businesses and residents.
Can keep warm and keep safe and
in times of need
And and like Representative
Garcia said if if and when.
There is a demand of change
then the state government can
work with the local governments
and and make these changes in a
way where we don't hurt the
citizens of the state and what
that will stand for questions Mr
chair.
Okay.
This is the result monthly.
Thank you you Mr chairman thank
you Representative
Representative just rings
forward
I.
I believe everybody here knows
that I served in the Martinez
administration for a brief time
and when I did.
during that time we had in two
thousand eleven if anybody
remembers was a tremendous ice
storm came to New Mexico.
And power lines came down.
And people in northern New
Mexico.
if they had not had.
The natural gas or propane or
wood or coal.
that there were there were than
tremendous number of deaths that
was a an emergency that was the
during that time that was the
the first I believe in a more
urgency or disaster that the
governor had to declare at that
point because we had to get
people in here from other states
line item to go out there and
start getting the power restored
to people because once again all
that the all that the natural
gas did was allowed homes to be
heated.
but in it but it is after like
to have that is the most
important thing Pete is more
important than light for
convenience for here
even food she is more important
food at that point.
Mr Mr speaker Mr chairman and
gentleman.
That is a concern of of the
direction we're going if we do
completely eliminate.
Natural gas if if that is
something that we completely
eliminate in the effort towards
zero carbon.
This is something that we've not
considered is.
The the actual mortality.
The actual rate of mortality the
lives will be lost
people will literally have no
choice if we go down this
direction in the.
Rural parts of the state such as
on the Navajo reservation where
fifty percent of the homes on
the Navajo reservation in New
Mexico do not have electricity.
Their sources are propane.
They don't even have natural gas
to them because it's too
expensive to run lines to them.
So they have propane.
The the it's it's interesting
that during the discussions that
we've had during the ETA was
that.
In San Juan County especially on
the reservation have much higher
rates of asthma well Mister
speaker and and I Mr chairman
German and.
You know Representative.
That's because they're burning
holes in their homes unfiltered.
And what will happen in rural
parts of state if we do away
completely with natural gas and
propane.
In zero carbon efforts.
what will happen is folks in the
rural part of the state will
have no other choice.
Because because once again if
there is power lines are coming
to them and it's all renewable
and they do not have any sort of
battery pack which the poor will
not be able to afford that these
rural communities.
They will have then they will
be.
they will have no choice.
But to protect themselves by
more.
Would and more coal as a heating
source which will bring on
other.
Issues
and so I I just to I would I
would ask Miss Suazo Sanchez is
is this has this been any
thought of that I heard
Representative Garcia.
Mentioned that the cost of
conversion Singapore we almost
impossible even in cities.
but if if if once again natural
gas goes away they will have no
choice but to somehow converted
do without but the actual.
idea of actual protecting life
I'm not sure if that went into
your thinking and and I I
believe
Your your your expert is from
someone so I know that was
something that happened during
his time could you speak to that
just a bit.
Yes Mr chairman and members of
the committee
this is about cost I mean I just
I guess I would start with this
this is a consumer piece of
legislation that for first and
foremost this isn't just a nice
to have the utility stand up and
support it's nice to have a roll
lecture coops we have spring
electrical officers our area and
they do an incredible job but
there are times where the power
goes out and where we live in
the northern New Mexico in the
summer crystal mountains when
power goes out sometimes it
takes hours to restore new pick
Carson was just praise the other
day on the house floor the job
that they do but even times of
power goes out they have a hard
time getting it restored if
people are left without power
and so the concern is always for
everyone of a small town mayors
is what happens when our our
constituents don't have access
to power how do they want to get
their homes or like you said but
how do they keep their food when
when things go you know for
dates and I mean even and and
this is just talking about the
weather if you look at this past
summer we had horrific wildfires
power was turned off to some of
these constituents for a week at
a time well ahead of the fire
they were able to run their they
weren't able to run their their
refrigerators or any of their
electricity so they had to rely
on things like generators back
up and so and this is and this
is the harsh reality of where we
live we don't sugar coat it this
just exactly this is the way it
is and we don't complain and I
guess that's the other thing I
would say to I said I have
council meetings and I have a
town with thousand people people
come to those meetings and they
participate those in my
community that can stand the
that are the they can least
handle an increase at the pump
increase at the on the electric
bill or gas bill those people
who don't come to my meetings
those same people don't come to
these meetings either they don't
have a voice and so takes
matters like myself being is our
local communities and and
stepping up on their behalf to
say Hey we need to do something
like this we're not gonna drop
something and I'm in my area
that's going to ban natural gas
or or any types of fuel in fact
if you go and talk to more Clark
who.
Was the merits of evil mystery
talk to more mix into submitting
to fire Republican and Democrat
they are both advocating for
bringing natural gas to their
area this is not a partisan
issue it is really something
that it's about access and
affordability for for those
people who don't have a voice
and so we're trying to do we're
trying to do more of that and
that's why we brought this
legislation for to talk about
that something else you touch on
I guess I would like to touch on
briefly and also Representative
Garcia touch on it was the
affordability of of retrofitting
homes we're in the process of
releasing a natural gas study
but I want to go and put some of
the data from that so most
crucis where were Representative
small is retrofitting a typical
household appliances could cost
more than twenty eight thousand
four hundred dollars depending
on the plans models home
configuration labor and reliance
on natural gas these findings
dovetail with CA researchers
found that the cost to replace
major gas appliances in homes
nationwide would cost us more
than two hundred fifty eight
billion dollars all right now
here's what I would say their
members in my community who do
very well they would be able to
go and you know purchase these
purchases equipment it probably
wouldn't do it happily but
they're going to go and purchase
and they're going to put into
their homes the large majority
of my community lives at or
below the poverty level they're
not getting twenty eight
thousand dollars to go and
replace all of the equipment in
their home on top of that of
that conversations with spring
or electric if we were to all go
to states everybody on state
almost got richer the lottery
will wanted to rapidly change
oversight you know we're being
idealistic we wanted to move to
that let's get it done Skrillex
of apt upgrade a lot of our
system just so that we can meet
that demand because they are not
prepared for us today to be all
electric so it's going to take
time and so anyway I'll stop
there but I guess my point is is
that this there's a lot of
moving parts to this we can't
afford to have a municipalities
going around it arbitrarily
banning types of energies or
types of services that can be
provided at.
It's not good for consumers and
I am telling you right now today
those people who are going to be
most impacted by I'm not ever
going to come to this committee
they're not ever going to go to
accounts we just going to be
impacted and lives just going to
be harder.
Thank you Mr chairman I I don't
have another question I would
just I would just urge.
Things that we do that work.
Better in urban communities
don't work so well.
In the rural part of the state
and and and I and at times I do
I am concerned that we passed
too many laws that fit in Santa
Fe.
And we do so many things in a
hurry with a with a good idea.
But we have got to take into
mind the poor.
The people who are not here
representing themselves and
expect us to represent them.
And an area of the
Representative Garcia looks like
you have a would like to respond
to that then that we've lost Mr
chairman of the regional twelve
you mentioned that a lot of
people out there but for you
you know my district Germany
this sixty five percent native
American.
Not only that the city of the
water in the are but one filter
and it's making sick they don't
have anything else so we did the
propane away from the people the
state is that pretty awful
you'll have mission recipient
all.
My concern is is we all.
He construction of pool the the
but wait so far all the way from
my district these people have
I.
And it.
Maybe Mr chairman what my
district.
What you're able to use our.
Full of people to get I would
manage.
Well as it is right on gentleman
there all and all water in the
crawl.
We will be doing really well
following from these people they
have more resources to and we
need to look at these things
there will out there in the
number of New Mexico is
different and will you what you
my district from tier.
And the people have nothing that
they're it from the.
Responsible for state in all
fifty people while people to the
the
Just by talking to jurors I
think we should open our eyes to
see what's happening in the real
world other than you know we
have the quarter Mr chairman of
the school level to get that we
don't have a quorum.
I won't on the real world there
was a big problem do we really
need to be.
Thank you thank you.
Representative Scott.
It.
Representative for.
Need to to.
We're.
Do you know where they came to.
You have a point to this right.
Mr Chairman working towards
that.
What what.
Mr chairman and members of the
committee and and representative
of Scott.
You're gonna have to like me a
little bit I don't know where
you're coming from.
Mr Chairman representative shop
which that.
What what is introduced.
And to the.
electricity transmission changed
minutes critics will those
electrons moves to the demand
the card is what shores
generated.
Which you.
Yes I agree with that
Representative Scott so Mr
Chairman representative.
Four eight local communities.
All rights.
Is connected to a larger group.
In those select home she
developed from space mission
works.
The.
Look.
Would you.
Yes I would Representative.
Mr Chairman just the other point
is that thank would like to make
is our the.
Issues a piece of consumer which
each reservation.
There are many stark.
In rural communities.
Which are the biggest problem.
Particularly in the areas where
the.
Are
they are the lowest portion most
large.
Sure.
If we Mr Chairman.
We want to do to ensure that the
state.
I could see that those.
Also be.
The local county.
Mr Chairman representative John
Kasich this piece of
legislation.
calls.
It kills more.
Your constituents
to digital.
Yes sure you should for their
the.
Wages.
Thank you Mr chairman.
Then Mr chairman if I may.
Miss Mister chairman members of
the committee and and we heard a
testimony also on on on the
internet.
About Santa Fe being a little
more progressive and and wanting
clean energy this doesn't
prevent any of that.
This bill what it does is it pre
vents.
It's.
Fuels to be taken off the
market.
Because we're such a diverse
state and within their certain
parts like like Kerry uh
representative that that need.
The propane or they need the
kerosene or they need whatever
to to heat their homes and cook
their food.
And what we're trying to prevent
here is for those fuels.
To be yanked off the market and
not be available to these people
that don't have the upgraded
if we're structure to find what
they need to survive.
It if
we believe that this is
restricting somebody from
building electric.
How of house powered by electric
warehouse.
Powered by something else this
is a what this bill does it just
keeps those fuels.
On the market and and keeps
people from pulling these feels
out where we don't have the
availability there are are
businesses there are dairies are
ranchers that need this variety
of fuels that we have on the
market today and we don't want
propane kerosene or or other
fuels to be pulled off the
market.
So that they can keep operating
producing food for us.
And and people to be able to
survive.
Mr chair members of the
committee.
Thank you Mr chairman.
The representative that
represents small.
Chairman I thank you to the
Representative thank you to the
experts.
Mr chair representative.
I have a.
Grown up something grants or
outside rates chair
representative we had a my
grandfather and grandmother's
home heated by wood
electric stove in another room
there was and all the old wood
cook stove Mr chair
representative the home that we
grew up in the mobile home third
through third grade through high
school still supplied by propane
and also missions east of Los.
Mr chair representative I I
recognize and acknowledge the
importance that you bring in
here today Mr chair
representative and maybe this is
a question for the experts this
bill is exactly and that
limiting local elector officials
and municipalities from making
choices for their communities
this is not I would say Mr
Mister chairman and
Representative small it is it is
but and I would save to keep out
arbitrarily without data without
you know good reason and things
like natural gas but
thank you Mr chair thank
Representative and the I think
the the diversity of fuels and
then those pieces of discussion
deeply important and I
acknowledging chair
representative Mr Gonzalez my
deeply appreciate no problem of
work with on a number of things
that thank successfully moved
the needle forward for all New
Mexicans.
I appreciate that answer that
comports with my understanding
of this that this does and Mr
chair representative.
I would.
I think the.
My interpretation of the
limitation on local elected
officials and the bodies they
represent.
Their process their reliance on
that it makes several is exactly
where it should be in the hands
of their voters they are
responsible to their voters on a
regular cycle
For for the choices that they
make Here Representative.
There are in take for instance
in Santa Fe I don't know if you
know the number I sure don't are
there are many
propane powered homes in Santa
Fe the City of Santa Fe close
by.
Mr chairman and members of the
committee I I couldn't speak to
that specifically I would guess
probably not and that's because
Santa Fe has benefited greatly
from infrastructure she has as I
have all of our urban areas they
have that infrastructure in
place and so a lot of the note
here areas like mine use me as
an example read about it does
not have natural gas access even
in my area there there are
people within my community
myself included that don't use
natural gas for these probate
because that is the best source
available to us for the next
one's going to stand out to so
for lack of infrastructure
here's the other thing I would
say we come to this body year
after year fighting for basic
things like water lines fighting
for bait and then I'm talking on
behalf of oil.
Basic things like water lines
waste water lines this idea that
we would be banning something
like natural gas is not even
cross our mind because we're
just trying to get the
necessities the very basic first
time we're still trying to catch
up with the modern living with
so many of our in our our urban
friends or family members are
looking to to
share things two thousand and
nine.
I think that this sort of this
state that we're in in
knowledge's local realities
economic knowledge is local
choices does not take away the
ability to expand diversively
structure across a number of
different areas.
The change in my interpretation
the change we would be
contemplating in this piece of
in this bill is to fundamentally
alter that balance to take away
the rights of local communities
of counties should they so
choose to make those decisions
Mr chair representative in in
what I've seen and what I've
grown up with it again when I go
home Tel zero mission to see my
mom.
That is a phone powered by
propane I don't expect that to
change in the very near future
and I don't think that we should
be taking.
And I think the decisions made.
In other communities by local
elected officials who are
accountable to their
constituents on a regular time
frame are going to fundamentally
alter the availability for that
propane truck to come out and
and so the propane when it's
needed there
it the it also a mission so very
respectfully I.
A knowledge gene the need to
continue to and stand
infrastructure provide diverse
infrastructure.
That I think this body in
adopting not to go into the
field but it up the other
measures including
constitutional measures that we
the voters approved just this
last session.
The knowledge is a reality
Representative right we speak of
and I do not question one bit.
But it does and we need to David
lamb at the local level the
local autonomy of other
communities to engage in some of
these important conversations
that aren't even necessarily.
Based around fuel sources but
rather as the example that we
are around building standards
and building codes which again
very much sort of a it seems
like.
A good amount of local decision
making and local control should
be there my interpretation of
the second that away here so
very respectfully I can't
support the legislation thank
you Mr.
Mr chairman of the transpose
okay thank you thank you Mr.
Thank you Mr Representative
great.
Thank you Mr chair and thank
you.
For bringing this forward of
Representative the more I had
not met you wouldn't welcome
thank you so
I guess the first thing I would
say is you can take the girl out
of the country but you can't
take the country out of the girl
so many years ago I moved to
Albuquerque but I grew up in
northern New Mexico Mr chair and
representative.
And so I A. C. S. I I hear what
you're saying in your bill I do
I have to say that we talk about
Santa Fe we also have to really
realize that Santa Fe county
extends clear to to meio and
little communities
that are not even mentioned in
our discussion respectively to
some of our representatives
Santa Fe proper is the City of
Santa Fe but there are many
areas that are involved in in
Santa Fe when we talk about it
and some of those areas still
survive on
Including my brother by the way
who still uses it would powered
stove
and
here to speak fuel is home
So I think that you know when we
talk about transitioning to
clean fuel and I and I
understand the transition for
you know to reduce the ozone
layer and and to help with
climate change and all that and
I understand that we are moving
in that direction
however I think that we need to
be sensitive to these small
communities because many of us
live Mr chair and representative
in a way where we have the means
that there are many people out
there who do not have that means
and I just remind us that you
know in New Mexico currently we
have about two point one million
people Mr chair about six
hundred fifty thousand of those
people plus live in Albuquerque
and that area but if you think
about New Mexico you're a place
like Shiprock in questa Kapitan
in Mescalero and hatch in places
like that including places in
the south valley that don't
have.
That economic.
Means that some of us.
Fortunately are able to live.
So when we transition we have to
understand that we are also
affecting a way of life that has
been here for hundreds and
hundreds of years and how we do
that is something that we need
to be careful about how we
transition and make those
transitions Mr chair and
representative and I think that
when we start breaking it down
we think about the thirty six
point seven percent
of our residents are white
thirty six point seven of our
residents are Hispanic
eight point five are listed as
Indian and Alaskan or and then
eight point five two percent are
listed as other and that is the
information that is out on the
web and so I bring that up
because we we look at our
population and we have a
responsibility Mr chair and
representative as we make these
transitions to include those
people and to ensure that they
are going to be not be
negatively affected in a way
that cop would cost them
Would cause them economic
Disparity or or wide in the
economic gap which you know we
already are dealing with poverty
in New Mexico so Mister chair
they like consciousness as we
move forward that we as we do
move forward into this.
Rail of a new energy in a new
way of living that we do not
disenfranchised people that have
lived a certain way for years
and years including generations
of their families
in that we are sensitive to what
we are doing in making our
decisions thank you Mr chair
thank you Representative.
Thank you very good
Representative Townsend.
thank you Mr chair.
I.
Thank you Representative right.
I was.
Thank you
Station years ago Representative
Lundstrom.
When she described it for
district very much like yours
Representative the.
Well as the.
But without.
Running water.
And as we toured the area we
saw.
In the home.
It has generators the staff
outside of that they ran at
night we needed it and many
quite frankly that at the.
Kerosene and and
If they had any life at all.
And
Exactly with Representative
right those.
comments I think we have to be.
Thank you for
that the end realizes we sit
here seventy three three life
for all along but not everybody
lives in New Mexico like they
live canyon road Santa Fe.
And that is because.
Then they don't have the
infrastructure number one.
I think the some don't have an
ad.
The they don't have the ability
of the opportunity to New Mexico
like.
Seventy three years of life for
all.
And so I think
The eleven in.
Northern New Mexico in some
areas it does not have the
infrastructure or you live in
southeastern New Mexico where
many don't have the
infrastructure you have to be
sensitive that that.
That we as legislators should
not allow.
As a plate of people that happen
to live in in on.
Because a.
A of degradation of lifestyle
for those that live outside of
the town I think late.
Chair and representative bill
point there's not a lot of poor
people.
That are around this table.
There are a lot.
For people to sit upon city
councils and county commissions
there it did by the decisions we
make as legislators I think we
are given the
opportunity to be at.
Sir.
Areas and certain people from
being harmed.
By the stations of those that
have been left more.
Unfortunate and I'm one of those
of the top bottom I did years
and I've been blessed beyond
measure.
We I think I think your bills is
in line with that.
I think you're you're.
Your field allows.
the legislature to protect
those.
That.
Are working.
We have
One occasion that I'm thinking
of right now.
The legislature has taken away.
Local control.
And yet done it purposely and we
have done it at the.
With the in the in the something
that's good but we have I
standard living many people so
I'm I've I.
I didn't know where I was on
this bill
Representative more money came
in that committee had a hearing
with the LFC another problem
right off the.
But I you know better
I think this bill protects
people.
And I'm happy to support it I
don't think it I don't to get
great deals.
those more fortunate for and
taking on that would be all
electric for all the assure all
that but that's not the intent
of this bill this bill is to
protect those.
That have that option because
this so thank you
Representative.
Thank you.
Thank you Representative and
more yes.
I found the transfer station
helpful although I don't know
that.
I have a clear sense of.
Where I fall on this issue
Could you provide me with a
specific example of what.
what we're looking to do.
What is the problem that what is
the specific problem that we're
trying to solve here Mister Mr
chair and representative.
This is the preemption bill.
So what we're trying to do here.
Just to keep.
People from being impacted by
losing.
Feels.
We we we don't have anything to
do with the building code yes
just a an example
that representative Garcia used
in his testimony the.
Trying to advocate for the poor
people that if they lose sight
per instance natural gas that
they would have to switch their
homes to elector.
Because of that and we're
offered clean energy clean.
Affordable sustainable energy.
But in the change that we're
making and where we're at today
we don't want people to lose
something and not be able to
afford.
Or be able to get those.
Feels that they need for that.
Mr chair and representatives of
more thank you for that so.
You know when we're sort of
looking at the levels of
legislation and rulemaking.
Here at the state and then
towns and municipalities so.
Am I correct that the concern in
this case Mr chair
representative is.
Counties making rules for
passing ordinances that maybe
counter to the needs of.
Please
Mr chair and and and
Representative.
In layman's terms yes but but we
can go into that a little deeper
We're we don't.
I personally don't like
restricting counties and stuff.
But look at this as an ****.
And in a real strong ask for the
counties to work closer with
state government.
Two two eight eight it doesn't
restrict them from doing it.
But it it makes them come up to
us here at the legislature.
And it and so that we can all be
together on the same page and
work on these issues.
In a as of in the state manner
instead of County here our city
so they're not restricted from
from putting electric houses are
not restricted from but then
natural gas are not restricted
from doing anything.
They're just restricted from.
Restricting people forget that
forget to get so.
We we we don't want the people
to be harmed.
By restricting them from getting
any kind of fuel at the end like
the example I gave on the very
we needed all these different
fuels according to the weather
according to where we fit the
different
mechanics of things and
everything else like that and
they do it on ranches they might
have a diesel generator out in
the middle of a pastor to run
well they might have a propane
tank up middle pastor run well
they might need propane to brand
their cattle at the brand new
shape.
Gasoline to get there you know
diesel to get their for their
diesel trucks and there maybe
they're bigger trucks that haul
of the they need all these
different fields and that's what
we're trying to do is pre
empting anybody from stopping
these fuels available to the
people.
Thank you Mr chair and thank you
Representative this is this is
clarifying
but under this legislation it
would be fine for the state to
state.
Everything has to go after no
propane no call attention Matt
madam chair that is correct and
then would you like to leverage
on that Mr chairman and and
Representative Dixon that is
corrected the state decided it
wanted to take action in which
the state has the drive the
energy transition at the
mistaken in the state we have
that prerogative what I would
what I would say is a local
municipalities this
Albuquerque's the Santa Fe Los
crucis as those are the
exception that might have the
ability to regulate these types
of industries those are the
exception I would say the vast
majority minister polities in
New Mexico don't have the
capability they don't have the
know how we're the knowledge or
even subject matter experts and
I even wonder new projects I
work on projects across the
country whether it's solar wind
you need a lot of these
municipalities end up having to
include our Sam's eyes but
counties will end up including
in their language that whatever
that states a solar installer
but they're gonna have to
provide funding so that they can
hire a professional staff to
help you know Institute whatever
rules regulations they want and
that's a common practice across
the country so I would say most
municipalities just don't have
that capability and the real
concern here and it again it's
like the legislature all of you
were here to do the work that
the people I as a local elected
official and other local
officials reduce their do the
work of the people but
occasionally that apple ends up
in our group and they are not
there to serve the best of the
people that that only serve what
is that they believe in and that
happens at a local level and I
would argue with I would I would
I would say that I don't
necessarily agree with
Representative Smalls comment
that they were held accountable
because we're not I would say
that local elected officials
there's no opportunity for a
recall election so I could pass
literally anything I wanted at a
local level and my citizens
would be subjected to a we do
wait until the next legislative
process for you all to come
along and say wait a minute you
guys might have overstepped your
bounds or whatever orphans up in
a lawsuit and one other example
I would give whether you agree
with fracking or.
And all of the county more a
look at banning.
And even Paul Garcia who is well
respected among among so many in
here was a county commission at
the time told the county
commission we can't do this this
is a legal they still passed it
knowing full well it was legal
they were taken to court they
lost important very easily and
have the had actual corporation
the times that we want to go
after you for attorney's fees it
would have to pay those and even
after they were advised not to
do it they still went ahead and
did it anyway and that would
have bankrupted them quite
frankly at Sheldon after them
for attorney's fees it would
have bankrupted them and they
would have and and those elected
officials who were there would
have just left office they would
have been arrested nothing would
happen to them so so the
argument that we are counting
just you to get back to the I'm
sorry I'm sorry yes Sir so.
Back to your point yes we we
were trying to make sure that
you don't have someone go out
there just arbitrarily some
group or are some advocates I
mean even several counties in
this as well several counties
very equipped they looked at a
local ordinance for oil and gas
drilling and he still didn't
come up with something and they
are very so I would just say
most of us are not in that
position.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
Generally speaking Mr chair and
representative I don't like sort
of Hodge podge sets rules.
Get on the issue of preemption
is something that.
Sometimes makes me uncomfortable
I don't
Mr chair and representative.
Uncomfortable.
Taking up the issue of
preemption in this committee I
see that it the next committee
is government elections in
Indian Affairs which is Mr chair
representatives were actually
feeling that question to be
answered however since this
deals with.
Utility services and fuel
sources of energy.
I understand why it's here
that being said I don't know
How we gonna vote on this I.
And just.
And sure and not comfortable
with
The preemption issue
but with that Mr chair I don't
think I have any more questions
this time Preciado.
But will.
Comments
First is.
No one's coming for your test
those.
A lot of press on that lately
excuse me Mr chairman one in
understand which ones coming for
your test no one standing dealt
a graduates going into people's
houses and tell in the change of
their.
Detail is change out there
This is true the preemption
bill.
John I understand you don't want
this happening in your
community.
And this is a bill saying it
can't happen in other people's.
I mean it's it's Santa Fe city
Santa Fe came in here and at a.
At the bill that.
The total tell you what to do in
Springer.
You'd be upset.
That's what this bill is a nurse
it's a branch of the.
So there is about these.
I think rightly so move towards
electrification.
building codes are available
about the destruction.
Yeah retrofitting homes is
really expensive.
That's why we've tried to
provide assistance and that's
why it's rarely require.
Yeah we we have old housing
stock and the newly on canyon
road.
Some of the oldest house housing
stock in Santa Fe.
and really can you read this is
interesting because it's a mix
of really high and and and not
very.
Yeah I can support this because
you're trying to tell.
You're trying to lose
communities from doing things
which they think is right which
doesn't affect.
If the city state has to we
could it would start a new
construction electrified.
That doesn't affect.
I live in a small community in
Santa Fe County.
My house is pretty tight as
solar this program.
Yeah
don't miss proposed taking any
of those things.
It's just.
This this bill
I believe it's a reaction to it
I can.
Representative she made things
like to.
Four except the motion
Mr chair members of the
committee.
This bill would not prevent
anybody to go full electric to
go whatever whatever direction
they want to this bill does not
have to do anything with
building codes.
What this bill does is it keeps.
Particularly if we are fuels
from coming off the market.
It makes the the.
It makes the it keeps open the
options for all those fields for
the structure that's in place
whether it be in agriculture in
urban areas in rural areas of
the state it lets them.
Stay warm cooked their food.
Have light at night.
This is what this bill does it
we just don't want.
Anything to move any too fast.
We're where we don't have to
prove that that we are.
Going forward with a better
cleaner.
Way of life without having the
sustainability.
And with that.
Mr chair if Representative
Garcia I would like to make a
comment.
