community of New Mexico

In 2001 he
moved to the Bernalillo county

areas comments
this expertise and
dedication quickly led him
to the role of a detective

Mr Bregman has been
very active in our
community around
safety issues
and crime issues

Albuquerque.
Reading his resume I had
no idea he was that

Or Bregman lifestyle
company where he grows
cal's in cat
who knew that
I didn't know him when he ran
for city council

with that Mr chairman I
will yield
to
sheriff Allen for comments
first.
A good afternoon committee and
the madam chair thank you
so much for having us
so honored to be
named by the governor from organized
crime commission on a dedicated
public servant making
sure not only for the prevention
of crime but also to catch
offenders I believe
my experience to give
to this committee will be
well rounded in the expertise
that I have dealing with
organized.
Criminal networks when I dealt with
homicide specifically and also
for violent crime
also to have a forward thinker
and to be able to evolve
not only for technology but
be able to evolve not just from when I
started law enforcement which was a
long time ago the to make
sure that we're
also.
Educating our our young youth that
are coming up in the law enforcement
profession that goes
into investigating these crimes and
also being able to go over
any type of state line communicate
with anybody in a pretty
decent communicator being
able to make sure that their thoughts are
heard and being an active listener
I think that goes a long way for any
type of commission that you're dealing with
to make sure that you're getting not
just the root causes but the violent
causes of organized
criminal networks to help protect the
citizens of New
Mexico.
Thank you so much for your comments
next I'll go to
them.
Member thank you
Madam chair members of this
committee is honor and a privilege
to be in front of you today
and I want to tell you it's an honor and
privilege to sit up here with
these amazing
people that are on been
appointed to this commission
we've been working several months
now and I can tell you
that the professionalism
and the experience
is is really quite frankly
amazing and I'm
honored to be here I
I up I do know
that I really
appreciate the fact that the
governor has tasked
the US this
organized crime commission with
really focusing on
organized crime in the area of
gun violence
a narcotics trafficking
human trafficking in
organized retail crime
and we are focused like a laser
beam and I'm just so grateful
to all these folks are sitting up there
with they're willing to do
this so thank you
thank you for your comments the
honorable Juditha
camara.
Thank thank you
as you can tell if filled
retirement
in the
miserably
and.
I'm glad it is this is very
certainly a very different way for me
to help on serve our community
and and in this
capacity
there was overlooked into first a
Sam could tell you but I
do believe that my
experience actually need to Katie
many of the cases that we
are now looking at the crimes
that we're looking at
can be helpful to the
commission
and certainly
role of the judges
serving in terms of
betterment of the laws for the
things we could do to improve the loss
on for community and I
thought that's an area certainly
I could assist the commission as well
so I'm pleased to be
here a plea for the work
we've done together just a really super
group in terms of its
commitment to the
commission and and and the betterment
of our community in New Mexico so
thank you for having me thank
you cabinet secretary
both. Madam
chair members of the committee of thank you
for this opportunity here this morning
again honor for me to
be here as well
of I was gonna retire as
well and.
Also is looking for an opportunity
in a way to contribute on a
higher level and of been
able to do that through my
appointment as the secretary for
DPS
and what I
really found through
that experiences there are so
many different ways
to be able to connect with people
in New Mexico and to serve New
Mexicans in ways I
never expected before
one of the city Rio Rancho
I was always very proud to be able to
collaborate with others in the metro
area and across the New Mexico
but through this position there
really has been a tremendous more
opportunities to do that
and as the chair says
Sam Bregman for the organized crime
commission has pointed out
it really this the
caliber people there on this commission
the professionalism we
really have been able to connect with
a lot of people and to really
start looking in and delving into
the issues of organized crime in
New Mexico and
again.
Going back to the point of being able to
contribute on a higher level
the potential that is here
in order for us to have an impact
on those things as
gun violence
organized crime as a whole
for human trafficking
organized retail crime all those
things the potential
is tremendous and I'm really looking for
the opportunity to put in good
work to again
continue to fail at retirement and
hopefully make a good difference for
New Mexico so thank
you thank you what what
is.
Madam chair members of the
committee. Thank you
for allowing me to to address
you and
as everyone has said for
me it's very.
Humbling and sometimes
intimidating to be sitting
here amongst the people
that I'm sitting with
they're they're amazing
professionals and they're
the epitome of what law enforcement
is and just to give
you a like Senator Stewart
said pride the the least
known person here
is because I'm from rural New Mexico
from Silvercity New Mexico
and just to give you a little bit of
information about me I
retired from the state police in
2008 and during my
career with the state police
I served on
several councils the D.
W. I. Council Luna County
Grant County service
chair for both committees
I also serve on the
current high to committee for district
7 I've served on the New Mexico
executive committee for
high to I've been a
school board member currently a school
members for silver consolidated
schools this my second
term a first term was in
2006
I during my
career with the state please which I thoroughly
enjoyed. I
yes the number one for sergeant
and yes number one for Montoya during
my tenure and
I was appointed as captain
of district 12
in 2006.
And I believe that
one of the reasons that I I'm I'm
sitting here with these
experts here is a.
Most of my career serve on the
border of New
Mexico and
during my time with the state please we
met with
the ranchers
and and Luna County and he
double County.
And we address their needs
and the needs are part of
what the commission is talking
about
illegal
drugs.
Crossing illegal immigration
costs crossing.
That no.
We address those needs
private property
people were trespassing on
private property destroying
fences leading cattle
run
and
during my time in the state
please.
The governor I believe it was bill
Richardson at the time
and executive order which created
operation could be heard
and that eventually turned
into what is known as
today is operation
stone garden and that's
the operation that's held in the
border were
heavily there heavily patrolled
and during that time when
I was in charge of it we
have several operations
that included the seizure of
narcotics money and
illegal immigrants.
I am.
I learned from this committee
every time I come to a meeting
and I think
I can give some
some.
Personal experience some issues
on the border thank you for
your time.
Thank you so much before I go to questions
of the committee is there anyone of the
audience here in favor of
either one of the country's.
C. 9 anyone in
opposition.
Okay we'll go to questions
of the committee senator Ortiz the
penal.
Thank you Mr chairman and and
thank you all for your
willingness to
add yet another
responsibility to the many
you already all
of I guess
the history of the organized
crime commission.
Is is what I'd like
to.
Pursue with you it was
established way back
in
the seventies I think
with sandpaper
chief. That
name rings a bell as any of
you and little older
than you are but.
And and then but then the legislature
did away with it
we basically do funded
and said we don't need it anymore
so the first question I have
for you all is what is organized
crime and why do we
need it
now.
If you I can.
However I think a stab at that
the Mr chairman that manager
on.
Senator so organized
crime organized crime was very
different back in the seventies with looking
at the mob coming
into the into our state and
concerns about that
it's interesting though if you look at those will
reports that they did in the seventies
they're also looking at
some of the drug trafficking
issues that were going on as
well in organized
crime is is is no
secret organized crime is happening
every single day when it comes
when it can start all the way down the
cartels the
develop this poison
effect now and
get it across the border and then
dispersed out in our streets
that is organized criminal
behavior there's no doubt
about that the human
smuggling factor as well
that's going on right now
in our in in our
communities and we're
4:00 hours from the borders you
know the human smuggling a
horrific
crime
that we
need to do everything we
can to get a handle on it but that
also was organized crime in
other words it's not just simply
one person doing something
it's an organizational
effort the same thing
with what this legislature did
recently with retail
crime in passing that organized
retail crime legislation
where literally
groups of people
are associated with each
other who are ripping
off retail stores for
example and then
selling it on eBay or
whatever other social
media network if you
will
organizations
and it's an organized
crime is
I mean I I gotta tell you
it is it is
more prevalent that I think it was
back in the month is
organized crime right now with
the kind of for
crimes that were seen when it
comes to gun they smuggle
drugs up they smuggle guns
and money back down
and they are organizations
that are at work that have
networks that are
doing this and it's
of it's different it's different
than just summon
individually committing a
crime in these
organized
criminal organizations if you
will are are are
creating
tremendous.
Problems at every level
in our state so
I think it is very neat
well we'll need.
And I don't know if Mr chairman of
any other members
wanted to add
anything to it Mr Chairman
said.
They believe it with
all of the they issued if you
seen it was started back in the
seventies and it's
very prevalent now with organized
crime in the state of
Mexico really specifically
Bernalillo county but it spread so
so much further as going
into the corners of the State
crossing the lines
state lines I believe with all
are experience up here from the
judge from from the DA
to secretary Boeing
myself and Mr floors over
here I think
all of the different.
Titles we've had all the different
experiences that we've had I think we really
tackle what's going on because
it is plaguing our
communities all of them just not Bernalillo
county which I represent
we need to make sure that others are
represented in small rural areas
just like Mr floors with it was
saying because there
look for anybody that's
week organized crime looks for
people that they can prey on
organized crime looks for people who
aren't experience somewhere to get the criminal
networks and how to
go straight to the source of the
problem I believe it's a commission
that's needed and of
commission that it could absolutely
give a voice to so many others
that don't have a voice for smaller
communities.
Thank you that I
think that helps clarify some of my
thinking about it now do you
have a staff
and you have a budget
request is this
going to be a full blown
investigative arm
or where we stand with that
if I
can.
Madam
Senator couple thing
so to date
this will start in may or
June
I have assigned a few
people in my office to
help with this thus
far.
But the idea is
absolutely and
I I
know that we
are finalizing the report
to send to the governor and the
legislature about our
activities for the last 6
months if you will and
I think you'll be somewhat
impressed with the amount of work we've
been able to accomplish
in a short period of time I really
believe that at
the same time yes
there are and I'll just say
this one of the things that
we really all come together
on. Is
there is such a
need for a
central intelligence
gathering.
Type when it comes to quote
organizations for law
enforcement in this community
so that the gather the information
distributed to the various law
enforcement committees
statewide
yes we do plan
on I do plan on
pushing for the legislature I
know it's it's late in the
game and I get that
but yes we we will be
asking for a a budget
to stand this organized
crime commission and
give it the opportunity to conduct
full on
investigations.
Yes thank you
thank you Mr chairman
and chairman.
Thank you senator
semantics.
Thank you very much Mr chair
and thank you for
volunteering for
these positions along with
your retirement
or your regular jobs
will this
of organized
crime also.
Cover human
trafficking.
Yes yes a bit
madam chair
110
percent I mean yes
there is a true
problem of human trafficking
on the border so okay so the
reason I ask is I believe that
as well but we also
have a task force
that we Fund.
For
services to
individuals who have
actually been
apprehended due to
investigations
so there might be
some areas
that you are going to focus on
that are already
being.
Investigated look
at that will need
some assessment of
how you can coordinate and
cooperate.
Is the one issue I'm talking
about another is
that a lot
of the.
Organized crime that might be
in the Bernalillo area
or coming from the border
goes into our rural
communities and
I represent parts of 6
counties of many
rural areas
and in particularly in
Torrance County often
times the drug trade comes
through
takes vehicles up to the
mountains
dumps some burns
them still some
other vehicle to keep
going
and
in particular some of these are
rural areas They Might Be
land grants for this is
happening and they brought
this to our attention in
the F. B. I. used to work
closely
with me and local
authorities about this
but the drug
trafficking came
from the border up through
Bernalillo
so I just want
to bring it to your attention that there's
some rural areas that are going to
need to be
included in like to
believe your
task is only Bernalillo
county.
Come before if I may
madam chair
that that is
not what we believe that it's only
really a county in fact to the
contrary we
believe it is a statewide
issue in every way
in the tentacles if you will of
organized crime reach
out in a very
Broadway across the
state and we I think we
have if we didn't
already know what we certainly heard
it in the last 6 months in our
meetings we've had
we've talked with just about every law
enforcement agency in the
state federal and state
not yet all the locals
but a lot of the locals
and that is really important
because the smaller
sheriff's departments if you will
the smaller police
departments need
some help with
gathering intelligence understand
a connect the dots that what
they're seeing in their community is
actually emanating from a different
part of the state or from south
of the border and they need that kind
of help and so we are very
much I think in
all the
furnace.
Madam chair members of the
committee Senator Stefanics
if I was expand on the collaboration
piece and a lot of our meetings
as you mentioned we've met with a
lot of our federal and state
partners with some of the
sessions that we had and I don't feel
like this is out of place least
mention this.
For this meeting is
that as we're
standing up the commission
and we're assessing how
to.
Be a partner and to
contribute to the overall picture for
New Mexico.
Some of these we've been talking about how
to collaborate with every agency
involved and so if we as
organised crime commission get information
or intelligence our
interest really is to make
sure that we're good partner ensuring
that intelligence to make sure that we work
with every partner to
include our federal resources our state
resources and County
and so we had talked about
for example taking in the piece of
information with
uh partners across the border
in Mexico how do we then
distribute that information make
sure that everybody
for that affected your station is
aware and they were all working together
so it's not our interests to
work in a silo to
have an investigation just done
by the organized crime commission and
and not share that information and then
get the credit that's not the interest
at all one of the things that we talked
about was having that
shared intelligence
across the entire state of New Mexico
having a network of
that really as information
comes in it is disseminated
almost in real time to
the people who need it so we can be effective
in every jurisdiction and
so. That's
part of the part I'm
most excited about because I can
tell you that has forced criminal
tells is concerned
and we talk about this a lot of people
that have experience
across you know state here in
the metro area you always rely on
your relationships in
order to know what's going on in a
partnering jurisdiction
so if I am a
detective working I know I have
my detective counterpart that can call
for information we want
to get to a point where
it's not just shared through
partnerships add on a
personal level but also through
a data network we can
share information in real time
get it to the lead of
those organizations so that everybody
can understand the crime picture of New
Mexico.
Thank you and Mister chair
my
decks of statement
is really just a statement that
requires no answer
I believe that
many
people would like
their trust
in law enforcement
to be
built up again.
And another rural area
I have.
Local law enforcement
and state law enforcement
looking the other way when there are
drug trades and drug deals
right on main street in a little
town. And
business owners have
called
repeatedly
and they've been told and
less we catch them in
the act we can't do anything about
it. And
yet
you know these civilians
you shouldn't go out to try to
apprehend
you know these drug offenders
but I believe
that some places
people are concerned
that even if they reported
something it's not
really going to be taken
seriously Ezzell
just a comment thank
you all for volunteering your
positions thank you
thank you Mr chair thank you
Senator Duhigg.
Thank you Mr chair.
Thank you all for
being here today and for for
serving New for all of your
service to our
state what in
the.
I was looking at the statutes
offer this commission
and. When
I talk about the qualifications
for members 1 of those
qualifications is that
the members be people of
unquestioned integrity
and I think that is certainly true
for for all of
you
but then I kept reading
and it is
it is a
wonky statute
I is passed in
1973
I think some of the staff if someone
brought this in the bill
today it would
never get through Senate
Judiciary.
And.
And then and and
and and and I will talk
about so my concerns with the
commission please do
not take any of this as criticisms
of you as you
in anyway because I don't I think we
could not have better folks serving
on this commission this is the
underlying
legislation that's
creating that
so it doesn't apply
to anything and
I'll back up a little bit.
I understand that there is a need
for confidentiality when you are
dealing with trying to
figure out how to address organised crime
in our
state.
But there doesn't seem to be much
balance
with the between the need
for confidentiality
and what I
think is that.
An increasing commitment to
transparency hi
in our state
so so it doesn't
apply you can have
private hearings.
Just because you want and
there's no real standards
laid out in the
staff why you would have a
private hearing verses a public
hearing you can
take testimony from a
witness in a private
hearing if one of you
just one member is
there.
You have this invest
investigatory
power.
Hi but the fourth
amendment doesn't apply to
your subpoenas because
their ministry of
so.
I miss read when you're
talking about helping out the on the
smaller sheriff's departments
in rural areas
who might not have the ability to kind of
gather evidence in the same way that
you all do so you
guys could gather
evidence in a way that is
not subject to the the fourth
amendment that protection against
unreasonable search and seizure
and then give it
to.
A sheriff's department.
Who.
Have they gotten that
evidence they would have been subject
to the Fourth
Amendment
I can't if I'm
not particularly in this well but
how they conduct themselves
if it would have violated the Fourth
Amendment they would be able
to use it but if they're getting it
from you
do they still get to use I
I. I
don't know
thank this commission can be
funded with grants from
private individuals
and because every
doesn't apply to anything
we would never know who
was funding this
commission.
This I
and maybe I am just very naive
but I have not seen a
commission like this
before and so this was
these are some things that
that jumped out at
me.
As as
on
but.
I I think my question
is to you all
is.
You're working within the structure that
exists here working within the the
statute as it
has
what are
you all doing as a
commission.
To to
help balance.
Kind of the need for trans
transparency to a reasonable
extent given the subject
matter what you're dealing with
with the
restrictions that are
that you're working with and and the
statutes.
Madam chair thank
you that's one of the great reasons why
we have a former Supreme Court
justice on our.
Action but I will tell you
this.
You know the statutes
have been reviewed before
by the Supreme Court were
up held
so as far as that is
concerned I don't believe
that in any way
you're going to be seen
this this commission
of violating the Fourth
Amendment and then not.
In in not doing
what we can we can
discuss various things about
whether or not the Fourth Amendment
applies to this or this or
not but I will tell
you. That we
are doing everything we can
to make sure to have as
much public participation
as anybody wants
now on our for
example we meet once a month
so far and we have an
open session we we
we we put out notice or having
this meeting and we have an open
session for anybody that wants to make any
comments to this but also we
do have a closed session because we
are dealing with
highly sensitive
issues and
perhaps
when you are delineated what
cartels are doing what
activity in a particular
place
I can tell you the safety of
people are involved and
it's a very
dangerous type
of criminal organizations
that we're going after so
I do believe it's obviously
very important to be able to do
those investigations
and not be subject to
an April request right off the
bat and blow not
only blow entire investigation
but perhaps out
people that are working
with us or with law
enforcement on capturing
the very bad bad
people that are for
example running human
trafficking or running the
fentanyl up from the
border so
I'm we also
pursuant to the statute
are required and we and
we and we've.
So and we're in the final
drafting stage if you
will a I think of
someone comprehensive
report that you'll I
don't oversell to you all because
I know you love to read anyways I
don't want to oversell it
but we in the first 6
months we've accomplished a lot we
will be sending that tell
you everything that
we've been working on
and certainly I I know
during the session when we're making
the kind of request we are
that if if allowable
based on this type of question
is we will be more than forth coming
with the Legislature on
some of the things we're working
on and why
we're asking for what we're asking
for but there is a report it's going to
be to the governor's
office the legislature
the statutes
yes they are
made in the 19 seventies
and I don't disagree with you that that
would be a top statute perhaps
but understanding the kind
of work that's
done
I think it is important
that that many of those statutes
are written the way they are otherwise it
makes it very hard to go after
criminal organizations
if the whole public knows what
you're doing what you're targeting
it really it
hampers law enforcement quite
frankly so I think we
will continue to focus on making
sure we're transparent as we can
be and I can commit
to that at the same
time there will be necessity
we're these kind of
investigations are are
remained up
in a quiet if you
will.
Mr chair was recommended
I I appreciate that
answer.
And and and I don't know if anyone else on
the panel.
Want to add anything.
Something I I would ask
you all to think about not for
this coming session for
future one
I.
As you're you're doing your work
because we already have a law
law enforcement records exception
to impress
that I think balances
those competing interests
are.
I'd be interested to know
as you all are going
whether you think
that.
April plying to you with
that law enforcement record
exception would be
sufficient to protect
to lying to to do the
jobs you need to do
without.
Without being a total black
holes for public access
for our my
understanding is you know what
long investigation is going you
can't get the staff
but if it's 5
years later and you have for that
7 there's no pending investigation
than those records.
Subject to some of the the specific
exceptions are allowed
to to go to the public
so so
I I
would I think
it would be my preference at some
point in the future
to have law
enforcement record
exception just a
book that be the
protection that this
commission is under rather than
just a a
full market rent
never applies no matter
what's no time
limit approach
but I I'm
not the one doing the job you
all are so I would
I would love to maybe
have this conversation again and
in a year to
to find out if that is reasonable
approach or not.
That's been chart just
to briefly response I think
that's something we can all talk about
and we can kind of once
we get into this a
little bit more in the very specifications
we can tell you whether or not it
will what our
thoughts are and we'd be happy
to report back to you madam
chair.
That's all thank you senator
to the
piano.
Thank you Mr chairman just to follow
up on that just for a second I
would very much like to hear
justice no commercials response
to the to the issue
of whether or not the statute
which is not 50 years
old.
Needs to be updated
and if so
is there any.
Thought about taking a
look at it in trying to
to do something about it maybe not
as says a
Senator doing indicated
this session but by the next
session possibly updating
to the provisions of the
existing
statutes.
Chairman.
Senator Ortiz Y. Pino
I don't know.
Truly I don't know
I was jotting down every
word Senator Duhigg
reserve was saying with
respect I mean look the
constitution
or supplies
we'll get to suspend the
constitution
by the words of the statute
so I'm I'm not concerned
to to that degree
I do find your question
quite frankly interesting
of whether the law enforcement
exception would provide the
protections of to
tell you of a sort of found
some comfort in the statute I was a
little concerned I'm not law
enforcement one of the few on this
commission that isn't and
maybe a little
nervous
but serving
as as a civilian on
this so
I was glad for some of the protections
it again with respect to our work but
having said
that.
I I do feel that
there's been extraordinary effort to
be transparent to do what
we can as much as we can
public well having
the public sessions I think we're all
cognizant of that
I can tell you already
with the commission we
talked about doing something
specifically which I won't get into
and I can tell you so what is it
right. Do we
have that authority
I enjoy in some ways now
get what was put on here in
terms the voice of the
judiciary.
But going directly to your question I think
it's a fascinating question
and one that I have
startled with the police to
keep in mind as we do our work
so I think I'd be
Senator in a much better position
to answer that question as
we do our work and I remain cognizant
of these issues as we
work this
is a big issue to big issue for me
personally I think it is an issue for
the commission for the work of seen
this far.
I'm sorry I can't find a better
definitive answer
that's fine thank you Mr chairman thank
you thank you Senator
Lopez.
Thank you Mr chairman
again thank you to each of you for
serving because we all have other lives
are working session always giving
more of that.
That piece of the pie it was very
difficult thank
you.
And I appreciate the conversation
that we're having here today
but one thing I wanted to to
pass I noticed you know
looking in a press release that the
governor's office students such
with the membership
I know that there's no native
American on the
team.
And I wanted to
ask is one
hour reach are you doing
within our native American
communities
Department parcel we talk about
and then my W. R.
and all the other issues we're talking
about jurisdictional.
CERN's right of
how everybody
works together
and I believe that our our
tribal communities should be at the
table I know the governor
didn't the point I'm not questioning
why she didn't but what
is your out reaching your goal
to make sure that you have at the
table sitting with you in some
fashion
Mr chair our tribal
communities
so thank
you.
And chair and
senator a couple thoughts on
that I have actually
with this we
have a director of
the organized crime commission we have a
deputy director the deputy director
is focused on tribal
outreach and
international meaning
down south
relationships and building
those I know
personally that I
have I went
down to the tribal summit that the
governor had down in Rio does
so this year as
someone representing the
organized crime commission I know
secretary Bowie was there to
perhaps in a different role but I
was there I know
that I have.
That with
a number of different
tribal leaders I have reached
out I will continue to do this is
an ongoing thing but
I can tell you I have been to
numerous home
of those already
and we will continue to I'm
still trying to get some
some dates arranged
for a few others that we want to meet
with but I've talked with many of
them because organized crime
does not know borders
it does has no
care about a border whether or
not they're on native
American land or
on state in New Mexico
land or
down south of our
international border
organized crime doesn't recognize
that and so everybody's
affected and I have
I presented now in
front of
Sandia is let of
Laguna I
visited with most of them
down and in in
the Rideau
so but that's just
scratching the surface and I
understand that there's a lot of
work that needs to be continue to be
done and we will be doing
that that
outreach.
Mr chairman and I I
appreciate your mentioning
that but there's a difference
Mr chair
when.
When you're out region you're visiting
the different pueblos different
tribal communities but
when you don't have somebody sitting in the
same room at the
table
as you having your discussions and
such of course
who are qualified as such to sit
there Mr chair
I I find that concerning
because
there's a difference when you're again
going to the communities and chatting
with them and I understand
that but when you don't have somebody sitting
at the same table
as you making decisions and such
I think that's a concern I
just wanted to raise that
thank you much Mr chair.
Thank you Senator
McKenna.
I thank you
Mr chairman and thank
you stained
nominees
really impressed with what you've
accomplished and how
you continue to serve in New
Mexico
I may have.
Miss Mister didn't
hear that.
The if this was a pro
addressed earlier
why did the
commission
go dormant
during was was at the
Richardson
administration.
I believe it
was before the Richardson
administration I think because even
before that
before the administration for the
registration
we we've actually been doing
some research in the
public record does not
necessarily
reflect
there was
why a
specific.
Something took place that
everybody just said we're done
or not I just think there
was a funding issue
at a time when they someone
decided there wasn't going to be any
continued funding for
but I really believe though with
looking back at what they were working
on and looking up now with
the challenges that the state
faces now.
This commission is needed more
than ever to be honest
with you I'm not saying that because I'm
voluntary all my time to be on this
commission and we
don't have other things we could all be doing but
it's really really
important in light of
what is happening
in our state currently is
structured to deal
with these kind of issues so I don't know the
answers or short answer and I don't
think anybody does
doing.
Yes I'm not point Senator
Ortiz just what what
we're told in this book which
is that in
1995
the legislature
cut the funding.
But you know what those legislators are
like I don't
know.
Representative Kevin.
Thank you chairman I have a follow up
to that it just occurred
to me.
Okay nominees
do you know of any other states
that have a similar body
such as this
one.
I don't have the exact
names of them there
there are a couple others
there me
and kind of.
At I don't know the specific
names right now but other
states have for
example what
is a for law
enforcement fusion
center we have what's
called a fusion center but it's
only homeland security
run its does not have a law
enforcement credential
other states in
Utah for example
has a will like
one of the best el Paso
has a very good one
down south as
well where
they gather intelligence to do
the kinds of things that were we've
been expressing to you
today
there there is I want
to say it's New Jersey has one
within their attorney general's office
it's called the same
thing other other
entities have various
different.
Kind of coalitions of law enforcement
to work but nobody has the
kind of focus I think
specifically and only
on organized crime that this
commission does there were other
8 there were other states for years and
had organized crime
commissions dealing with the
mob back in the seventies we
weren't the only ones that
but I think this is something unique
that we have the statute
still on the books in the ability to
do this which I think is
fantastic and I
I know the part of our
part of our task in the
statutes is to
work with the border states for
example not just down
south but Texas
in Arizona and Colorado
and the other states
to work together on
this whole issue of organized crime
together so I
don't I'm sorry I don't have the answer
for you on the other
specifics.
Chairman I mean I thought of one
more question
thanks member station
thank you
because the nature of the crimes
that we've been talking about so
far have
you already or do
you plan to coordinate
with ATF FBI
and other federal
agencies.
We we
already
have and
I think it's no secret
that the organized crime commission
or for example work with the
FBI
on that operation done on the
Bandidos
recently that was public
that that with that with that we
help with that along with
many other law enforcement agencies
all my that we
have met with the a TF
we have met with the genocide
actually we have met with the
FBI they have come
presented to
us to our
commission and it's been
it's really been I opening
and all of our federal partners
have been more than excited
quite frankly that we're doing this
because they see the need to within
the
state.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you chairman
that's all I have thank you Senator
Duhigg. Thank
you Mr chair I have one more question
I forgot to ask you
all have we'll have rule
making authority
are you planning on using
that rule making
authority.
I can I don't know
that that's actually been a discussion
yet but I.
I'm not opposed to using a
rule 20 but I don't speak for
the commission on that issue I
think that's something we will
discuss our next meeting I'm
sure.
M. as
if there's anything that you guys are
we're currently planning
no there's nothing there's nothing
right now okay.
Thank you. Thank you I
just have a couple of comments thank you
for serving might was
one Senator Lopez brought up I have
to pueblos of the he got a and
ation in my district
and my question was going to be if
there were any tribal members
who would be part of this
commission and so hopefully in
the future that's something that we can
see them finally if
you look at rural New Mexico which
is what I Representative when you talk
about the top 2 issues
in my district it's crime
and housing and those
happy to hear that you're going to work
with smaller agencies
to work and connecting the dots
I'm happy to see police chief is
that Garcia here from Espanola
police department so it's good
to know that there's going to be teaming to
help us in rural New Mexico

more members out here now
more people than in the
committee has
yet to take an actual picture
of us so we
can.
Well I'm honored
to be the
sponsor again
today for us
3 folks for
our law enforcement standards
and training council
at the first being Mr Sam
Brickman
you've heard of his
experiences
to me this is exactly
where we need someone with his
kind of experience in
a training and
standards council standards
and training council
this is really where police
begin
their training
they're learning
about how to be a good law
enforcement officer
this council has
needed an upgrade in a while
and I'm very glad that
the governor's doing that
so that
is for Mr
Breckman
I'm also sponsoring
Richard Matthews
Richard
C..
Yes.
Mr Matthews has been a
New Mexico state
police officer for
almost 25
years he's
currently the captain of the New
Mexico state police
advanced training
section of
the New Mexico state police
training and recruiting
bureau so Mister
Matthews is doing exactly
what we want him to
do on the
standards and training
council
this section they do
overseas posted
kadam including an in service
training for all New
Mexico state police
officers in
addition to being the captain
of the advanced training
section for more than a
year he was also
the New Mexico state police
advanced training section
sergeant from
2015 to
2016
it's also been an instructor at
Sanam since
2019
so he teaches both in the
criminal justice college
program and that the
C. N. N. Law Enforcement
Academy
so he is
a good addition to
this training
council and
Leslie

page.
Marks on some on the right
page.
The marks

worked away the ranks
there I was read the economic
program for
them for 10 years
2009

So very

You know our young police officers
and train them given the
best training possible to
provide the services needed
for our whole state
so thank you many
questions.
Thank you we'll take questions
after everyone's R. as an
introduction.
Good morning everyone or I guess it's
afternoon now
I'm doctor Beatty and I
like to clarified
biogeochemistry
I study on the changes
between the land to
the ocean and the atmosphere so
all of the chemical and biological
reactions so
I've been doing that for
gosh a decade now
I also work with Landel and
modeling smoke from
wildfires so
that's been a nice addition to
my academic
background I've been
an adult education for
about 15
years I will say
the closest I come to knowing
anything about law enforcement
is my time looking for the bad
guys as intelligence
officer
so I
look forward to the chance
to learn more from
my colleagues up here
and I hope to be able to offer
my experience in adult
education even though it's
not science the same pedagogy
and modalities still
work across all of
the fields.
Thank
you.
Mr chair and committee
I'm Nicole brown
I any started
and career in
911 I
like to say that public safety is the
family business
my grandfather retired for
the state police my father returned
it rich.
Retired.
With the Farmington fire
department and I have several
other family members and law
enforcement so
I started my career and
911
and
I am really excited
and honored to
be part of this
council
911 has had
the rules
dictating how
we can attend
the academy how the academy's
run since
the seventies and we've never
had a place on
the council or the board
so this is huge for our
industry and I'm very
honored to to be here
today.
Thank
you.
Hey Mister chair committee my name
is mark Swanson as a
Senator Stewart indicated
I am an attorney with the public defender's
office which is a
statutory requirement of
this council
I'm sure that some of the law enforcement
here's a little weary of having a public
defender on the
council but I did
also serve as an assistant
Attorney General where I
was the administrative prosecutor
for the law enforcement academy
board so I do have a
a bit of a unique background and
will be honored to serve
on this committee and council
thank
you.
Thank you good afternoon
Mr chair committee
members first of
all I'd like to say thank
you for the the opportunity
to serve on this
council also be
before you here today I
sit in the unique opportunity that
I came from one of the probably
not from one from the largest
department in the state of New Mexico
or training was abundant
where I had the opportunity to work
because they do a task force
officer we're going to
cover with the
DA I
was in the first ever see IT
crisis intervention team training
the state of New Mexico
I I was able to attend
the FBI National Academy
so I come from a department
that pretty much training was all
we had now is the
chief of the Espanola police department
I'm able to use all that
experience so when the
opportunity came to be on this
board and I firmly
believe in that standardization
and just that unification
of overall for everybody
the training for every
department some of the
largest departments to to one of the
smallest and I and I really
appreciate this opportunity
and want to hopefully
share with the other committee chair
members and be able to bring
the knowledge that I have from
the 30 years of law enforcement
I think it's an opportunity that
that I really look forward
to and I hope
to serve in that capacity and work
with all my fellow committee
members.
Good afternoon chair in the US the
committee I
drive Sir mills fall I
have a PhD in clinical
psychology I
am a primarily Clint
Ives trains generally
in clinical psychology but my focus
is on forensics
and has been since
I've been working in behavioral health
since
freshman year of college of men
dedicated and wanted to work
into it actually in high
school
so for about 15
years I've been working I've worked
in inpatient hospitals
with individuals with psychotic
disorders with
neuro developmental disorders
most often all
autism at
with many other presentation
substance abuse
personality disorders
many other my
research in graduate school is
actually on
personality disorders
most really
psychopathy
so I've also done
research with the
federal bureau says
destinations to be hit their
behavioral analysis unit so
I've done some work with them and
seen the federal law
enforcement side
I worked I did my pre
doctoral internship at
the federal correctional complex in
Buckner it's the largest
federal correctional
complex in the country
and I it was very lucky to
work into medium level
security presence
there I get
to see many many different
things I
also would Q. clearance
for the department of energy
for the national security
work I do
which is a top secret
level security clearance
I do some of those
evaluations
I think this is an incredibly
exciting and innovative
council
and.
The fact that they added
of behavioral
health
person is
very innovative and
very exciting
because
I think is everyone in this room
knows the topics
about behavioral health has really
increased recently expressly
since COVID and behavioral health
problems have increased since
COVID substance abuse
psychotic
disorders
its plethora of
other things so I really hope to
bring my expertise to
help law enforcement
learned how to
interact with individuals who may
have a psychotic disorder
developmental disorder or a
substance abuse disorder
and also to help support the mental
health of police officers it
is
any one
of if not the most stressful
job an individual night
United States can have and
we needs to
support officers and help
them get the
resources that they
need. Thank
you.
Everybody thank you very much for your
time my
name's Richard Matthews
hi I've been with the state
police from was 25
years I've been
teaching in
law enforcement for 20 of
those years I
taught.
Not just
in the CNN law enforcement
academy would also state police
academy as well
as the law enforcement
academies basic
academy.
And also for the bulk of my career
I've taught not just the
state police but to
officers
in all the different agencies
around New Mexico as
well as
of state and federal
agencies.
I'm very excited about this
opportunity should be given
to me because I see the
importance of not just
training officers of the
academy level
but continuing their training
afterwards.
One of the things that I see
personally in all my years
I was on our crime scene
investigation team for many
years so I got to
work hand in hand with
agencies.
Of all different sizes I
see the absolute
desperate need
for standardized
modernize training
at all levels with agencies
that don't necessarily have the
funds to be able to
push training out like the state
police to us for the
Albuquerque police department
in providing the opportunities to
the state to the officers of these
agencies to continue their
training so
that everybody reaches a
level that the public expects
us to reach is
something excites me.
Thank you for your time thank you so
much before I go to the committee is
there anybody in the audience
in favor of any
of these appointees.
Seeing none any
opposition.
Signal go to the committee
Senator Ortiz Y. Pino.
Thank you Mr chairman thank
you all for for being
willing to serve on this
I was looking up trying to look
up and I see nothing in our
book about this
particular.
Organization.
This is attached to the training
academy is that what
this.
That maybe the.
The captain Matthews
maintenance senator
Lopez.
Mr chair Senator we
created
this.
Entity when we separated
a few years ago through
legislation because it used to
be on one
entity and we separated
out so now you have one to CPAS and
and and this commission
that specifically looks at
training standards
etcetera the other
commission that we separated out
is dealing with
more if the officer
has. The
staff messed up for something
great it's a big deal so they
deal with 2 separate
so this is something you want
when the book was written
and typed out it did have this
new addition in a
okay that explains
so.
We just started just you
just earned okay that
that explains a lot
so so
my question then is and and maybe
I'll directed you kept in
the the
standards that you're working or
not just for the state
law enforcement academy
then there for all the
departments and all the training
academies in the state or
or what is your charge
that's correct Sir we are
so brand new
the group that you see sitting at this
table gets to
figure all of that
out and we're we are in this
together if
you wanted my personal
take on this
and it's to
modernize and standardize
training not just
at the academy's all the
satellite academies
but the post academy as
well so
that way
an officer is
and who the
state an officer in
2 can carry when
officer is in
jail first officer
Clayton or an officer with the state
police gets the
same quality and
standard of training across the
board.
That's critical
especially when we're talking
about hi liability high
risk areas
like use of force.
This is
this is frankly with the public
expects and
this is something
that.
From my knowledge is unique
across the country.
A an appointed body that
is responsible for ensuring
officers.
Are trying to protect a particular
standard and that
standard is met on the
training side.
Because there's so much
variation in we
could potentially get taught
to people at
all different
levels.
Thank you Mr chairman that that
helps clarify some
confusion
thanks
to us on the I believe it's
the this is the only
council in the
country like
this I
believe that's what we were told that the
first meeting that we
hope that we can set a standard
for the rest of the states
so I believe we are unique
and we do this
we're covering special I seem
state police local
and then also the 911
operators to.
It it's very important what you're
doing so thank you for being willing
to tackle it
and look forward to
seeing what happens as a result of
your efforts.
Thank you Senator Lopez did you have
any questions on Mr
chair just one
I'm and thank
you.
Up.
In light of all of the other
issues that have that are out in
our community right we talk about
law enforcement and the different
trainings that many of
us I think
I have spoken about in
in communicating with some of you
also and in different
venues
you know DOJ of course has been
here with APD Albuquerque
police department
there's emissions down south in Los
crucis you know centered around
excessive use of force
and I know Mr chair that the
legislation that we passed
of course didn't food or we don't use
chokeholds right mean
I know I'm using the the vernacular
verbiage but it was
budget differently stated in
the legislation
but I would
hope the issue moving forward
Mr chair
and beginning this new journey
as a new commission
is
that.
You also look is
to
the training that is provided
for officers
specifically
another route another way
which I know do
exist.
For apprehending
those who have committed a crime
but that it doesn't
include chuckles
I know that it's still part of the standard
is used in many different
ways but I
think there's other resources in other
ways that some of
us have been researching to
use and also
to keep in mind Mr
chair DOJ
had a presence is still is here
in AP
but I think it's also a model that
maybe in as you move
forward for
training
purposes.
That we keep that in
mind
Mr chair I I know with the issue
of mental health it's and it's an
issue.
For those that are being apprehended
and such but I think also is
to with those who work within
the law enforcement community
making sure that they too
were able to
access services for
themselves to and I think
that maybe hopefully part
of your mission as you look forward for
training but also making sure
that there's support
for our law enforcement
person that they to
have
opportunity for support
because I know it's it's just it's
not an easy job.
So I just want to mention that Mr chair
and I'm anxious to see what comes
out as you move
forward for you know for us to
receive a report
next interim thank
you yes ma'am if
I there's an
analogy that often given my
training about what
law enforcement training
really as this
is nationwide not just
here.
If you think back to when you're in high
school whether you were marching
band or play a sport
this is what law enforcement training really
just. The
academy would be like
the summer before your freshman
year you spent 2
weeks learning everything there is to
know about that
activity.
And then after that let's
say it's football he spent 2 weeks
learning all about football then
your freshman year you get
0 extra training
unless you're at a well
funded team.
You get no more training
that next year freshman year into
play you're expected to play
perfectly.
Then your sophomore year
if you have a well funded
team.
You might get maybe
an hour maybe 2
other topic you're expected to
perform perfectly whether
it's. Because the
control tactics communication
skills
of. Any
of that.
Okay so you maybe get one or 2
or 3:00 hours the next
year that you're planning
and then after that your
junior in your senior
year.
Somewhere in those 2 years you
might get another one or 2 or
maybe 4:00 hours if you're
lucky yet
throughout your entire career
that you're doing that activity
you're expected to perform
at 100 percent
really based on the training
that you got during those 2 years
before you start.
There's a lot of focus so
goes into teaching
academies.
And one of the reasons why I'm
so passionate about this as I
look at the absolute desperate
need when you look
at many of
these
excessive force cases
including within state
police.
A lot of it comes down
to the
officers don't have
enough training
right now
that they have that they can rely
on so they are
simply relying on
what they're trying to remember
from sometimes 1015
years ago.
If we can improve
training and
actually get
training at a particular
standard because that's another
issue.
Then we can actually
improve the quality
of things like dealing with the mentally
ill of
finding
multiple options
other than chokeholds
in order to do escalate
and take control of people
these things are absolutely
critical in training and
there's nobody else nation
wide that is really
even thinking about
this. Thank
you Senator
Mister chair I appreciate that
too because there was a shooting in
my area of south Delhi of
Albuquerque where there is a woman
who's about 4 foot
11 that was
shot 21 times
by the sheriff's department a few years
ago.
And Mister chair I think that was called
excessive
force.
In there been other instances
but I speak about one because
that's my community.
And I hope
that that is never repeated although
there's been some further down south
in Los crucis recently that have come
to light.
So Mister chair I I think that
the training
is so important
but it's not just the training Mr
chair is the accountability
portion and as for
the other commission comes into
into play also
how we hold
persons granted
I know it's a hard job that our
officers to have to carry
out I know I appreciate what
you all do but on the
other hand too is that other burden
is carried on the shoulder of how we
respond
right. So
it could be a lack of training and such
but as I spoke
into a secretary but we
just before he left because I
had also asked this year's
past when he was in
front of our committee
about his
commitment about training
with regards to excessive
use of force but
also for those of how you respond
for to do escalate
a situation and he did say that
there's more training that he's already
instituted and I I
really appreciate him sharing that
information but it's
also Mr chair
what.
What would you as a
commission are asking to
be done but how is it being
carried out and is that accountability
portion because
yeah we can all go to school we've all
been to school we've all done that
but then how do we
follow up and I
think Mr chair that's the
important
factor
that I've seen
through some of these various people will
talk yeah we do it we're doing it
but where is the accountability and how
do we follow through and I see
we those are
positions of leadership
in in the chain of,nd
within each of the
particular departments
so thank you Mr chair
thank you any
other further comments or
questions see none with the will
of the committee.
We're gonna act on each of them
individually.

leave it Albuquerque economic

our organization as the

thank
you.
Thank you.
My name is Walter
Adams.
And I would just
like to say I
appreciate the opportunity to
come before you I've
been on the commission since
2019
with the.
Almost 5 years I put it
on the commission so far that
gives me a total of 46
years with
D. O. T. I
started back in
1977
and I'd like to introduce my wife
who is over here
and we've been married
45 years not coming in
June and I've been working for the
DOT for 46 years
so it gives you
an idea of of where I
am I started
off with the duty
back in 1977
as a surveyor
Ancona's construction
projects and back
then we used to do our own
staking we used to door
we used to stake out everything
for the contractor
then they did away with that they went to
contractors taking
I went into inspection
and I started inspecting all
the projects that you see
throughout the state
and making sure that they were in
compliance and within
specifications
and and then from
there I went into a
materials testing lab
where we did all the testing for
all the materials again to make sure
that they were they conform
to specifications and
the and then from
there I became a maintenance
area supervisor
which oversaw all the
maintenance
in our district which was district
for and that
was maintaining everything from
fence to fence signs
snow removal
of patching blading
mowing
and then from there
I moved up into Santa
Fe and I worked
to with secretary
Rhonda I fear and
then she had asked me to
come to work up there
and then I work
for
secretary Tom
church
he had asked me to stay on
with even what I would do in that
capacity is I
would go out and visit with all the
employees and
I went to all 82 patrols
throughout the state and
my job was to go in and
see.
How we could do better what
was working what wasn't working
and what we could do
and and
so I
did that for another 15
years in Santa Fe so it was
a total of
42 years when I decided
to call it quits
and it I think
call it quits I called it
quits because I thought
you know it's time to give other people
an opportunity
and I loved
it and I'm gonna tell you this
working IDOT.
You're not there for the money you're
there because you have a passion to help
people you're there because you
have a passion to make a
difference and I've had
the opportunity to work with
some of the finest
men and women
ever and so
it's been a great great
opportunity for
for me
and.
I was also on the board of
regents.
I was there for almost 6
years I was on
the west as chairman of the
west Las Vegas school board
for 12 years I've
coached I've
been on all the recreation I
was on the committee that we put up our
first recreation
center up in Vegas
I've always advocated for
use
originally before I came
to DOT I was going to be a
teacher as I
just love helping kids and I think
that.
There are a they're the
greatest
and.
I just want to say that I
want to thank the
legislature.
For the money that you
gave.
Because we're only as
good as the money we have and
that's that's the basic
and it and so far we've been
lucky that we've been on
you don't have some good budgets and were
able to get projects done
and the other thing that I would really like
to thank you for
and I'm hoping it's a
little it's a little
spill but
last year in the last 2
years you've given our
employees great
increases and
I'm telling you that our employees
are we're going through a thing right
now we're we're dealing with
recruitment and retention
and we're losing a lot of employees
as everybody is
but it's getting harder and
harder and so I
would ask you that if you get the
opportunity to do that
you give these
consider another big race
for please
I.
I DO I'm just
honored to be here before you
and I appreciate the
opportunity and
I think all of
you.
Thank you so much we're now
going to go to the audience is
there anyone here in
favor of any of the
conferees.
To see none any
opposition.
I see none of those
now go to the committee for
questions or
comments.
Senator
Stewart.
Thank you Mr chairman
and I'm probably
going to get this name wrong
so is it
time Khan has
done just conscious
okay just like it's
written.
Kind of like it's
written.
I have a message for you
from Senator Padilla
who is so sorry he can't
be here today wanted to
be here to
do your confirmation
so he just want to make
sure you knew that he
was planning on being here and
then we change the time Senate
really messed him up so
he was sorry he was not
going to be here thank you
Sir and Mr chairman
I just have to say I think the
governor's getting better better
at these appointments
because it just
this whole day has been
wow these are the
perfect people
so it seems like
another perfect
people kind of stay
at group up
here so thank you all for
wanting to serve on the
department transportation.
Thank thank you senator
any other questions or
comments Senator
Duhigg.
Thank you Mr chair.
Thank you senator and.
Conferees
I. Was
recent I didn't know about the
state road fund until
recently hi
and I've I've heard our
chair finance say multiple
times that it is
is this wonderful deal
where locals.
Have only have to put up 10
percent of the cost
and then basically
the state road fund
will will
provide the rest of the
project
I don't I said I'm
seeing that you
all.
Deal with policy around the state
Representative but I don't know if you know the answer to
this but I I'm curious about
how much it's being used
and how many locals are are
actually taking advantage of what sounds
like a really good
deal.
To I'm happy to answer that thank
you
Senator
so we have a
limited budget obviously
and the the communis
apologies around
my district and and
I will speak to my district
alone because that is what I'm most familiar
with those municipalities
will come to us with their
projects they do a
presentation
to the
district engineer and the
other staff
at the district including
myself as the
commissioner and
we will that to those
projects we
cannot fund them all
but we have never had a
situation since I've been
on this commission where
those funds have not been used in
leveraged for projects
within the municipalities that they would not
have been able to do otherwise
so it's an incredible resource
for these municipalities
to be able to fix
something that might even be
a trail or it might be
sidewalks it might be something
that to them is
very significant and impactful
in their community to get school
buses from one place to another
but they would not have been able to do that
otherwise but for the fund
and in many cases we also
do a waiver of
that match
for those communities that
cannot meet the match we
have some rural communities even
in our district here district
we have a real committees
that sometimes might need that
waiver as well
thank you Mr chair
is great thank you.
The representative
on.
It's the local local
government road fund
and that's one of the nicest thing
should be involved in and
I'll tell you why
I come from rural.
New Mexico
and we come from
are we have more
coming San Miguel
County and we have
some other but we're some of the poorest
counties anywhere
and the
city's the
colonies the villages
would have the opportunity
to do some other road
projects to do
so a bridge
to do some sidewalk
as commission channel
and said but more
importantly some roadways
and depending
on I think if
it was it was clear
for your table.
Before the pandemic
I think we got $160000000 and
sixty million
dollars and
that and that was divided
more or less through the 6
districts and we
were able to really help out a
lot
but.
These last couple years I
think this last when we got like
10 by 10000000
per district that's still
goes a long way because
if it wasn't for this
money.
These.
The the villages and
municipalities the counties
would be it be able
we have 3 projects right now
in Las Vegas
that are going major
projects and we
just finished one that was around
the old town of Bridge Street
area. And
all that was done with
with the
government rules one money
so a lot of people think that
these they like to make people
think that they're the ones getting the
money but if
you want for an and I'm gonna go
back and applaud you again
because you're the ones that give us I
mean give the money to the
role fund and you
appropriated so
if it wasn't for that
then we want to be
able to give back.
Back in the day I'm going back
to.
The eighties.
Each district was getting
about.
2 to $3000000
for that role for
and and and we went all
the way up to 33 during
this this time and
the least that we've gotten is about
111011
so I mean it's fantastic
and we thank you for
that.
Thank you very much thank
I.
Los Angeles Albuquerque
isn't in my district
and I they've
been trying to get some work
done on fourth street
for a long time
and
date I think didn't know
that this was a resource
available to them so
I'm hoping that they will be coming to you
soon.
Good good

It is here thank
you.
I'm gonna move to the public
safety advisory commission
Hey Chris mains is
here with your Senate
sponsor Senator
Campos.
Right level
3.
So we're still we're still waiting
on to but we'll
start with the Mr
mates.
Thank you very much Mr chair of
the Senate rules committee into
the members of the Senate rules
committee it's indeed
a pleasure to be here with you
today is we consider
the nomination of Christy
Maes
for this
auspicious group
and I indicate that
because over
Mr Mays is career
he has come
from of the
entry level positions
dealing with public safety
all the way through to a point
now where he
continues in
a very unselfish way to
share his expertise
with so many
people people in law enforcement
people within the communities
and most importantly those
people particularly
young people who
have been trouble
have at issues to
overcome in his
provided some
very good guidance
over the years.
Before I turn it
over to Mr Mays
for a some of his
comments in terms
of his
credentials I want to
indicate first of all that
is very highly
qualified to
serve in this
position.
And along with that he
comes from
a long standing
family background of public
safety
it not to speak.
Too much in terms of
what that history is I hope that he
will allude to it
but his father was
highly respected
in law enforcement
and what
I what I do know
with captain
maze of
the person that the sitting right
beside me
he worked to achieve
in in the area
of some of the
areas that were most
volatile honey came to
crime when it
came to helping to serve
people and most
importantly the way
that I see it is that he would
give the shirt off
his back as long as
he's able to help
any individual
any continues to go ahead and do
that he didn't not only do that
in public service as a
state police officer
but he also does that
in his daily life and so an
individual like this
with the credentials is
not only impeccable
but for full disclosure he's
also my brother in law so
thank you very much
thank you very much Mr
chair of the Senate
rules committee.
Thank you Mr my if you want to
address the committee you have a few
minutes.
Chairman.
Senator thank you for that
interlude.
I was born in Las Vegas New
Mexico to jade in Isabel
Mays my father was New
Mexico state police officer
who. Would
have graduated
70 years ago on November
from the aids graduating
classes state police
academy.
It is career in our family
we moved of many
times I attended moms on
all high school Espanola
high school Robertson high
school **** your in
house on the
graduated from Robertson
high school in Las Vegas in
1973.
After I graduated I served
4 years in the United States Air
Force and was honorably discharged
in 1977
I also served on the.
New Mexico state police for 23
years in 1977
to 2000.
From 1990 to
2000 I was selected as
a liaison from
the United States secret
service in
conjunction with the state police to
oversee the dignitary visits
a came happened back
in the nineties
during the election
years worked very
closely with the secret service both
in New Mexico and
nationwide.
I was also selected to attend
the FBI National Academy
the 66
session.
And I was a member of the New Mexico
state police tactical team for
5 years retired at the
rank of captain my
last assignment was a,nder of
the training and recruiting.
Division I am
currently an instructor
contract for aspen of
New Mexico
and the served in my capacity
for 17 years post
retirement.
Aspen is a harm reduction
program her clients are
court ordered for many non
violent offenses
whenever I can reach someone
and help them stay on the court
system is very fulfilling
for me we.
Have over 60000
people go through our class and
that's one of the only
losses it has of
stained through all
these years or
24 years into the
program down
doing at the statewide.
He played for the
DPS peace act because of
my passion for law enforcement
overall.
Specifically to stay connected
to the New Mexico state prisons
are the progress
and offer support and advise
whenever
possible.
When warranted of course
I am very impressed of the state
police is a progress
with the support of our legislatures
in senators that the
department is made over the years
my current role is that a
commissioner on the NM
department of public safety
advisory commission.
My personal life include staying
connected and contact
840 and MSP
retirees
the continued connections are
important because of the epidemic
of suicide rates among police
officers.
My brother and I
also oversee a cow calf
operation of our family
ranch in eastern San
Miguel County
hello raising cattle on the been
ranching land tire life
I am married to my best friend I
am. And we have
a blended family of 5 children
and 9
grandchildren.
Entertaining questions
or thank you so much Mr
males is there anyone in the
audience here in favor
of the appointee.
Anyone wanted
favors for the
record. Anyone
not in favor in
opposition.
Signal no go to questions
from the
committee.
No questions I do have a comment
I'm happy here this will afford it
even if it was short
lived.
Senator to the people
thank you thank you Mr chairman
and and I
guess I just
wanted to ask about a Mr
Mays I wanted to ask you about
the the role of
this of
Advisory Commission
as I understand it these are
disciplinary hearings
the 2 or
in. Yeah
hearings that you hold and then
you make a recommendation
are is that exactly
what you do Senator yes
of according
to state
statute we handle
the discipline and terminations
and get kicked back
from District Court
of for those
of you that may or may not know there
are 2 personal systems of
them law enforcement academy Law
Enforcement Academy text
has a personal system takes care
of all the law enforcement officers
statewide the New
Mexico state police has its own
personal system so
in order for there not to be double
jeopardy whenever there's
discipline
the state police
officers go through
termination through the
need from through the secretary
cabinet secretary
if in fact the appeal that
to District Court to go to District
Court District Court and kick it
back to us that's
pretty much the limitation on
that so then
Mr chairman and and
Mr Mays the
the it's the state police
disciplinary action that you deal
with correct and
and do are you
making recommendations to the
court or are you the final
deciders for the final
deciders when it comes back
from District Court but that is only
on termination as far as
other personnel issues
and discipline we don't get
involved in any of the
only
terminations.
And and final question
is the the actions
Mr chairman the actions
that the that the the
committee
Commission
takes
are they shared
with other law
enforcement
so they would know
that some decision you
made about disciplinary action
as a matter of fact the the the
chief of the state police on the
LDA board cels
he has an obligation
but he's got to report those
absolutely yes thank you
thank you Mr chairman.
Thank you senator any
other questions or
comments signaled what's
the will of the committee.
Senator Stewart.
Mr chairman I move that
we approve the
appointment of Christmas

within that his credentials
continue to be sterling

Upon his retirement

you so much nothing noted the audience
I would go straight to the committee anyone
have any questions or
comments Senator
Duhigg. Thank
you Mr chair all it sounds like
you have failed at retirement as
well.
Thank you for
the that's what my wife
says.
I.
Representative I see
here that
that one of the things
that the state board of finance
can do is
a request that the financial
institution division of our
LD make special
examinations out of state
banks trust companies savings and
loan
associations.
Since we also have a member of
the finance committee
here
I want to do a little plug for
FID because FID
has been chronically under
funded
and affect our state
banks have lost accreditation
because we don't have enough
examiners
to do what needs to be
done for them to be
12 and
so I'm really hoping
that
in their wisdom the finance
committee bumps up that
funding for FY do so that
they they can
do.
I these kinds of of
requests and and I guess
my question for you Mr Cassidy
is have
is that something that that you
requested of of FID
anytime recently
and if so were they able
to to
meet the request.
Madam chair.
Point very well well
aware of financial institutions
division we have never
had a request since
I've been on the board
for any of that kind of activity
has not
even.
Service.
Great thank you.
And I have another question but now
I can't remember what it
is.
Senator
Lopez.
Thank you Mr chairman Mr
Cassidy is good to see you
again and thank you
for your continued service to the
state.
If you have filled retirement
is just you know it it just
thank you but
I I know for individuals
who have time
available and have
the commitment that you have through
all of your endeavors
mysticism or smidgen of time
so thank you
Mr chair I'd also like to
mention for those on the state board
of finance I know over the
years.
Your
your.
Predecessors yourself and
others I think
have done
a wonderful job
in sometimes contributing
dollars and maybe the
legislature is
full of.
Through our own endeavors we don't
fund things appropriately
or there's a shortfall in
something down
in some budget
and I know that in your
wisdom of there's
an opportunity to kind of
help and kind of move things
along that otherwise
would be in a very hurtful
position and heard many of our
communities in the
state
and I know the financial background that
you and others on the board also
bring our state treasure also sits
on their Senator Sanchez
and others over the years have
realty I think
pride.
How the state I think that
what I call in Spanish they get antsy
and the love of our state
forward so just want to say thank
you for keeping New Mexico
at the at the center focus
of the decisions that
you make thank you Mr
chair.
Mr chairman and penned
Senator Lopez thank you for that
comment and the last
comment first of all
this is a great strong
board I'm really proud to
serve with Senator Sanchez
job at all with
the Travis ani the state treasurer
lieutenant governor and the governor
it's it's it's really impressive
and they always hold New
Mexicans
out front in their
thought process
and we've had a lot of
of course special request
for funding were
the funding that came out
of the Legislature wasn't
always adequate to serve
and we have another one this
month but I I a
COVID I want to make is
I want to thank the
legislature for increasing
the emergency
fund
and I would love to
hopefully see in the
future increase
funding because we're seeing more
and more of this
activity
I thought the last confirmation
hearing if I could Senator
Senator Ortiz C.
Pino asked
about that
and that was the number
one request that I
had left on the
table was to increase
the funding that was done
so thank you for that and it is
being used and we do do our
best to to spend
it wisely when
asked thank you
Sir.
Any other questions from the
committee.
The number what's the will of the
committee.

You'll always be a state
senator to me and
Majority Leader
a good colleague a mentor
a friend I could go on and on
and he usually tries to go
ahead and stop me about this time
to go and say okay enough is
enough but I I
want to share with you a few things
when we start talking
about about
Michael senator
Sanchez so served
23 years in the New Mexico
state 7
he was our leader very
tirelessly throughout the
years day and night during
sessions he
would drive all the way back home
and come back early in the
morning. And
they're very few that had that type
of dedication but he did it
because of this
family love the state
and most importantly
coming from a family that
continued to
share not only
politically but
from a business perspective
and most importantly from a
legal perspective
he took care of his family
he took care of his business
and he always rose to the
occasion to take
care of the great state of New
Mexico I know
that he's gonna have several things to
go ahead and share with you
but I did want to go ahead and
start the
presentation.
With the fact that the
senator Sanchez
gives his all to the state
of New Mexico we always
has and we know
that he is he continues
with his professional
life taking care of
his family and of course
always keeping each and everyone
of us in the back of
his mind he definitely
is a statesman
and a public servant and so with
that Mr chair
members of the Senate rules committee
I present to you with
honor of
Michael just
Centris.
Thank you Senator Campos

say other than

about being on the board of finance
is Mister Cassidy Mister
but doll
miss Turner sunny

thought I knew a lot when I was in
the Senate.
I knew very little
as compared to the
gentleman and ladies on
the on that
committee
they have they have really
taught me a lot
that I never truly understood
as a state senator
the staff for the board of finance
as well as one of the finest
staff that I've ever been
associated with
I I had a great staff
when I was the majority floor leader
I will tell you that the
staff will with the board of
finances just
absolutely fabulous and they
really do take
care of our monies
and our bonds and
all of the things that we
we do with the board of
finance

didn't Senator
Hotmail is
originally
I taught my daughter at the
land high school so we have
a special bond
there and Katrina course
told me to say hi she thought you were
going to be my sponsor today and she
was excited about
it and she just had a
brand new baby so
she's got a 6 month old at
home.
You know one of the things I I guess
I'm really proud of is that
during the legislative session I
did go home more often than
staying in Santa Fe
overnight there's just something
about being home
that made it.
Mated different for me and
made it better for
me
but the work you guys have in the
work you guys are going to be doing in the
future
I I I really compliment
you on everything you've done and the things
are going to do in the
near future madam
chair thank you but I I
think I've said enough and it's
getting late in the afternoon and I
know you all want to move on
with other businesses are
or get ready to go home so
thank you madam chair thank you senator
make sure you tell could train I said
congratulations I will
for you and your family will always hold
a special place in my heart you may think
also welcome in Poland thank
you senator any questions or
comments for the senator
Senator Ortiz the people.
Thank you Mr chairman and
and thank you Senator Campos
for for
sponsoring
senator Sanchez.
I only had a just a
question for you Michael
to foot
if anything would
you recommend
to us as a way of
strengthening the role
of the board of finance is that
is that is there anything we could
do to make it a better
functioning
organization
you know I I honestly think
that it's functioning very well
at this point in time sure
there some internal things
and I think the staff is actually
working on some of those things
to to present to us as
a board we
haven't gone through them yet but
the I know the staff is
preparing it but in terms
of the legislature.
Just keeping a watch on
the think that's that's the best
thing you can do
if we make mistakes then
I think you know we
should be held to account for any
mistakes we made out
with this gentleman and
the other people there I doubt
very seriously that we're going to make
any mistakes but the
last last I I I
forgot to say one thing and I'm really
sorry that the
you're going to be leaving
the New Mexico state
Senate
you've been a very special
part of
of the
Senate.
If you're you're
your attitude and your
thinking and
your
you know when when we get kind
of out of shape or when
we used to get out of shape got
that you guys get out of shape
anymore
you always used to bring us
back to where we needed to get
to talking about the issues and
not not
going off
where we shouldn't and
so I I just want to
congratulate you on your
tenure and and thank
you for the service that you've
done for the state of New Mexico
I'm gonna miss you a whole lot
of and I'm sure the rest
of them will miss you as well so
thank you for your service
senator well
thank you for that you were a
tremendous mentor Mr
chairman he was he
was somebody who
on several occasions came over
to me and said.
What your temper.
Don't blow up that in he's
going through a hard time right
now. But
that the several of
those episodes
the state in my mind
that I frequently call upon
your your wise counsel
when I get a little
heated with Senator Campos
or going to the other
side. Of
I I I do
I do want to ask you just some
of the came up Mr
chairman.
Yesterday in our
in our caucus
the the the point was
made and and at the time
the district is constrained
that we're at about R. Barrone
bonding capacity
that was it that the bonding
agencies aren't aren't going
to permit
further bonding it
is that the case or we
are we maxed
out.
Yeah Mr M.
may I address that Mr
chair
Senator.
From a legal
standpoint we are nowhere
near our bonding capacity
in fact
and I'm surprised to hear that comment
to see you know.
The decision has been
made brought to
our our board
that we know what we don't
issue any long term bonds
for quite some time because
of the oil and gas revenues
we don't need to we're going to
issue bonds on the sponge
basically unity addition one
day and then retired the next
day from excess
revenues that that
we have available for
the money reverts to the
the severance tax permanent
fund
our our bond ratings are
strong you know we've
got to win the double a
category.
We are very dependent
on oil and gas if there's
any criticism of the
structure that's it
but I think we are
speaking as a one board
member handling it very
responsibly as a state
with these excess revenues
not to be issuing long term
debt.
So that's my
take.
And your.
You
didn't limitation for
because of the blue
line.
We didn't want to issue bonds because
of an over reliance on
oil and gas and
and.
That may not persist
for many more years
so maybe that
was it but it but I I was
kind of taken but I don't know if any of the
rest of you at the same reaction
I did one when the point
was made by one of our colleagues
but. Madam
chair then say something that
I forgot to mention
and when you asked a question about
us as a board
one of the things that we run
into is water
issues.
That and and and and
different communities
asking for loans or
grants because of
the water issues in New
Mexico and I
think we need to
start taking that a lot more
seriously than we have in the
past
it's it's getting to that point
where a lot of communities are
running out of water
and having to dig deeper
and and and go
further and so
and if if
if there's anything I could to
encourage the legislature to
start looking at is
our water issues and making
sure and finding out about
these smaller communities
that are really hurting at this point
in time I I've noticed
just during my
tenure there that
a number of small
communities and the
they're just coming in and and the house
of waters now and
so we we we need
you all need to start looking
that that hopefully and
and and getting into a
little more than we have
in the past.
Thank you madam chair thank you
senator.
Senator
Stewart.
Thank you Mr chairman to
just respond to the center
to see Pino
I think what they were saying
was that.
They don't want us to pass
bonds because
of the it's boiling
gas that we're using to pay it
back so in
other words the implication
is that that's
not a solid revenue
source to depend
on to pay
back funds of
course.
Also all of the
the the folks
that are that are step
predictors are
saying that money's going to be
here 5678
years of the 40
even hits a peak
so you know
it's it's confusing
to us to be
told how will you know
you shouldn't be bonding
because you can't really pay
it back when
the people who are
predicting are
saying it'll be here for
5678 years
but that's I think what
they were trying to
say.
So
Mr chairman I do a
question.
So I'm looking on page
one of 5
and I just
never knew
that senator
Sanchez that you went to
Iowa western community
college after high
school and then
you spent a year at
northeast Missouri state
university
what were you doing in
Iowa and Missouri
in in Iowa I was
playing baseball and
basketball.
I played for a team
of well the
the college had a team
in what's called for
and I will I will western
community college
it is now move to council
bluffs
but I play for a a town
team as well called the current
days and I
wasn't as good as Ozzie Smith
if you know who Ozzy Smith this
Mr chairman madam chair
all he's a
hall of fame baseball player
was a shortstop I was never
in that class but
that's the time to my came
from and at northeast
Missouri state
I then went to another junior
college where I was
coaching a basketball
team with
that I was an assistant coach
with the I don't know
if you all remember Bob king
anybody remember Bob king
his brother was
coaching at the
Centerville and
so he asked me
if if I could
help them coach since I never
got a scholarship anywhere
else I was only a
mediocre basketball
player I guess.
That's an it by the way it's
it was a great experience for
me Mr chairman madam
chair it was a wonderful
experience we still have friends
we try to go back there
every summer to visit
and the families I
stayed with them live
with I
mean wonderful terrific
people their politics
isn't exactly what I like
but the there are are
some very very wonderful people
and I will all right
well thank you for answering
that it just
struck me as odd
but of course sports
at back then sent
you men
everywhere.
So on that
have you been watching
the Senate basketball
games and did you
see our incredible
win last year
by 1.at the
buzzer you know
that Is we we
started the winning
my my last year there
and we haven't lost since
so we passed on from
generation to
generation so I'm really proud
of our Senate and I just
I love it when we beat the house
this level we do
to. There was
that one here and there
when of called
the houses put on
when we were in the middle and
then we had all these guys show
up in shorts and
and demand to vote in
their short so we had to
make a put on ties
we forgo the jackets
but we made that make them
put on time it
hurts.
I got a week ago that the
house still
the trophy for months that
years.
Yeah I may you know the days used
to be you know I went been bill
o'neill came over to the
Senate I stole his
basketball Jersey
that night I was so angry
because of course of the loan deal in the
house we would win the
basketball game every
year then it goes to the
Senate we start losing
it I think you were
Daniel A. Ivey Soto steers
a path because I never did
get back to.
Anyway it is so great to see
you it's great to see you with a
smile on your face
when we all quit we'll get
smiles on our face to
right Mr chairman
madam chair I'm smiling a lot
more than I.
And one last thing that I I
think it's important.
And and it's again going back
to the Senator Ortiz
Pinos questioning
if you all ever need
expertise on bombs
financing in New Mexico
here's the gentleman and Mr
Vidal that you need to talk
to because I I
it's again I I can't tell
you how much I've learned
from listening and watching
how how they do things
like it
just absolutely unbelievable
what they know and their expertise
in their
specialized areas
so thank you madam chair
Mr Chairman so
perhaps they should do a little training
with us we've been talking about
training all
day
you know what we we can always
use training
so it
support I appreciate your
suggestions think
about that thank you thank you
Mr Senator
Stefanics.
Thank you Mr chair so I'm gonna
go back to the serious side
imminent thank
you senator for serving
and thank you Sir
for serving I think dollar
volunteers today.
Of I ask
this question of the mortgage
finance authority
and it's similar to something
that you all
of probably have to grapple
with and I'd like to hear how you do
it when you
find loans
or funds to
community projects are to
cities or counties for
big ticket
items
how do you assess
their readiness that
they're worthy of pay
back Senator.
Or grant.
Again all phone
yield to Mr Cassidy and I
can follow up a little
bit if I think I need
to but I really don't think
on the drafters Madam
chair sometime
Senator Stefanics
what the state board of finance
does unlike the
New Mexico finance authority
or the New Mexico mortgage
finance authority
is the the
only way we land is if there's an
emergency situation
so we don't actually lend
money to the our communities
just when they needed
emergency they can't they don't have bonding
capacity they come here and
that's why we need that part of
money.
But I tell you the New Mexico
finance authority and
and that could be Senator what
you're referring to
they loan a lot of money to our
communities.
They've been going since what
1992 and they've
they've built to a
triple a bond rating
and they have a full team
of credit analysts that
analyze the community's
financial strength
and hopefully making
sure they're not borrowing too
much and strained their
finances they have
never had a bond a fault that
I know of I was
around while in business
while they came up and
matured in New
Mexico mortgage finance
authority
they they make funding
available dollars.
Moderateincome mortgages
that really the private
sector bills
so no communities really
get any of their money
yet so I hope
that answers your question and
happy to address
further well
Mr chair you
mentioned
senator Sanchez about
water and
it would seem to me that there
might be several communities
that would come here board
with emergencies
regarding wastewater
or water so for
example if the department
of environment says
you have to have this
in this wastewater
treatment center
or ponder whatever
replaced and they have no
money to do it in 2
or 3 years later they
say we're closing you down
because you haven't done that
and they don't have the money to do that
is that something that would
come to is an
emergency.
Thank you senator Sanchez
yes as a follow up Mr
chair and
senator.
There are 0 water
systems there are probably an
equal number of
of
communities.
Sewer small so
maybe not that many
sewer systems point
and my home community
the this more as the only one that
has that the others that's all
septic systems
there's there's going to be a problem just
like the south valley
with that's
now pretty much converter all
the subjects to to
resources to.
What we have at the state board of
finance is
like $4000000
that it's available for emergencies
what we're finding we just had a
request from
there right and I
think there need
is about a $20000000
system they have to go to the
finance the
legislature for that
or or work with
the. Our state
agencies for for loan
programs like energy
minerals and New
Mexico Environment Department have lending
programs as does the
water trust board New
Mexico finance
authority so they they
they determine how much credit
is available for
borrowing and
then the legislature
really needs to figure out how to
fund
the rest of the money that they're
going to need we are seeing
construction cost go
way up.
Tremendous increases
and
we're our own worst enemy
if I could go in this direction
for a moment we have
so much money that we're putting out
to work the federal government
has so much money they're putting
to our communities to work
we have a limited number of
contractors in our communities
to deal with it and
consultants to help them
and our square footage
costs have gone from $250
a square foot on a building
project you know
to 900 to a
thousand dollars a square
foot we need to figure
out how to regulate
that and deal
with emergencies and
prioritize these capital
needs in order to get
the supply balance
supply demand balance
back in line to where it
needs to be
so that doesn't directly
answer your question but we were
a limited source of state for
finance muscle legislature
wants to give us authority
and more funding to deal
with that but
I would argue that we already
have other ways
to deal with the major
cost and we
can still continue to deal with
emergencies.
So Mister chair I think you brought up
something we don't we
don't find
the
solution
we provide funds
and I don't
think there's a agency
that really does provide the solutions
we've tried to
fund a few extra
people in different departments
to advise but it's
overwhelming and
so I do think that
water and
wastewater.
Continues to be
the.
The problem in
our state especially in our rural
areas and the urban areas
have very large
systems with even
bigger.
Dollars attached
that.
So but thank you again
for all your work and
I just think that we have
some issues that is that
are not coordinated
between all the different agencies
thank you Mr chair and
Mr chairman Madam chairman
of Senator
Stefanics
it's a long term
problem and
there's no short
easy solution to
it and with the
drought happening
the way it's happening
not only in New Mexico but in the
southwest all the way
through.
I think I think the the
that's why I said I think the
legislature has really
got to start looking at at
the problem and possible
solutions not that will
be able to find any
but
it is probably more
serious than people want to believe
at this point in time
so thank you thank
you thank you
any other questions or
comments Senator
Lopez thank
you Mr chairman
wanted to say thank you senator Sanchez
for your continued as
I mentioned to Mr Cassidy
your guidance here for New
Mexico in
the rules that you serve a
state board of finance
and you
know over the years the members who sat
your predecessors and such
have have
done a wonderful job
in watching our monies and
especially these this particular
pot of dollars that are available
to help our smaller
communities
and also some programs
within state government that we don't
quite fund
so I'm just want to say thank
you of
but.
When you give more of your time
and this was the theme is
been around here too so you're retired
but yet you're not
so thank you for giving
more of that
in I just wanted to mention
that with you driving
back home those evenings
I thought I would drive fast but
sometimes you would pass me on the way
home to and every
every those lights going by and I'm
like I know who that
was. Thank you
Mr chair but thank you
for all that you've done that you
continue to for
state much
admiration but thank you
center of us Mr chair
Senator thank you Keith
I also want to thank you senator
says a young teacher in the
land I was watching
what you were doing in Santa Fe
and I remember to treat I would talk
about how exciting it was to
have a dad as a state senator and the
Majority Leader and so
conversations happen to that
spark of wanting to be a leader in
my community was
modeled after what you did in the
land and I want to thank you for that
thank you Mr chairman and chair thank
you what's the will of the
committee.
That is that
Mr chair I would move
for the reappointment
of Michael
just Sanchez to the state board
of finance motion by
Senator FedEx second by
Senator Ortiz Y. Pino
anyone in opposition of
disappointment.
Signal with a vote of 6
in favor for
excused we will see
you in front of the full Senate in
January.
Level to have the gavel back
over to our chairman who will

the.

made within our to have
