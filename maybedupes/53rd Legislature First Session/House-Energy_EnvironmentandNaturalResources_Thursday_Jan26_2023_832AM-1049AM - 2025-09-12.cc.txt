I did four four I've received
several emails that I like to
work with so.
We'll just see how that goes
today and then.
We all have those well
first states can you take care
of.
Representative break up.
Representative Dixon your.
Representative Garcia.
Representative Montoya here.
Representative Nibert your.
Representative Rubio here.
Representative Scott.
Representative small here.
Representative Townsend Here.
Vice chair Sarinana.
Chairman clean your we have a
quorum.
Thank you we have a chance to go
through the house bill thirty
two the storage system expended
in house bill's.
You need to so these funds in
receipt of for service to press
years or not.
Representative Sarinana of the
rear and good morning Mr
chairman and members of the
committee.
House Bill
Thirty two and energy storage
income tax credit I have my
expert witness Masekela former
representative thank you.
to have an amendment.
I was hoping you
chairman.
Can I move the amendment for
discussion purposes.
Do we have an amendment or
committees.
Amendment.
Process loss of the budget
session.
I think that's all this.
So this is just a clarifying on
page we just go program.
For like twenty five after a
routine inserts stationary.
if tend.
One fifty three consider any
storage
page five line for.
After the first occurrence.
Strike the remainder of the line
after.
Instructed remain of the line
strong winds reprimanded when
instructing right thirteen.
We we just are are rearranging
how it stated and them six if
you.
Number one is is is known as a
standalone energy storage system
or is great tide provided that
if the system is great tie the
system has the capability to
provide grid services and
control communication
infrastructure exists with the
service private providers.
Number two has been tested and
certified by a nationally
recognized testing laboratory.
Three has a rating of four
kilowatts or greater with a
minimum of two hours of storage.
Item number four is installed
for use with the new or existing
but will take system.
Questions.
Yes that's all of that.
Is is there any discussion on
the admins.
There.
During the projection to the.
Okay seeing that you.
As of now it's on to the okay
the other storage system this
with
the energy storage system allows
the excess energy that is
produced by the top solar system
to be stored in can be used in
the home or by the service
provider at a later time point
energy storage storage in this
manner it will increase the
penetration of more renewable
energy.
And the specifics on the bill
the bill itself allows for forty
percent of the total cost to
purchase and stuff the energy
storage system of up to a
maximum credit of five thousand
dollars for residential system
in a hundred fifty thousand
dollars for system installed on
a commercial agricultural
property.
The last four million dollars in
energy storage system income tax
credit per fiscal year over five
year period with no separation
of residential commercial or
agricultural.
The system must be for kill once
and have at least two hours of
capacity or eight kilowatt hours
for greater.
And the tax payer just to play
for the system certification and
tax credit from him nerd and
report the tax to TRD.
One of the biggest changes is
easy for this portion of it
energy storage system income tax
credit that exceeds the
taxpayer's tax liability in the
taxable year in which that
credit is claimed the taxpayer
may elect to have the balance of
the credit refunded to the
taxpayer or carry forward for
maximum five consecutive years.
With that I will defer to my
experts
The queen and Representative I
think we've covered it but so
you can go straight to the
committee and questions.
to the committee.
First of all it's
so is there anyone this we tried
last I was we just people the
group first and then we did
people on so we'll see if that
works
It is a one in the audience who
would like to speak in
opposition to this bill.
Opposition.
Go ahead.
As of course
your cycle please briefly.
Mr chairman and members of the
committee how.
These Martinez director of the
energy conservation.
With the energy minerals.
Well we support.
Energy storage and the use of
energy storage.
Amenity in our state.
We are division cannot absorb
the program on the last we have
the staff resources for us to be
able to do.
additional program for that
reason I stand in.
Thank you anyone else in
opposition.
If you want to support.
Yes.
Mr chair of the committee it was
going to the with the Sacramento
chapter Representative thirty
five thousand members offering
Mexico West Texas we strongly
support this bill we believe
that energy storage would enable
on set that captures or energy
that can be used at a future
time is more beneficial and also
New Mexico could be a pretty big
leader when it comes and.
With that being said we were to
yes I was the others are built
thank you.
Others in support.
Good morning Mr chairman members
of the committee my name is
Jennifer yeah.
And Representative the renewable
energy industry association of
New Mexico also always fire we
we lost sixteen members around
since two thousand and for
future solar is going to be
energy storage whether its use
to provide.
State of emergency balance the
grid I the able to power poll
during peak hours typically
between one eight.
Or might be able to dispatch to
the grid.
The time we created is maxed out
the staff a similar situation
happened in California during
Labor Day where they're maxed
out the governor sent out tax
urging people to reduce our low
and they got almost immediately
four percent
decrease in and use its job
right so imagine going a step
further you could actually
dispatch Energy from people's
homes where they have in store
so that's a big example how we
could use.
Right now the national rate for
protection of storage to a solar
system is about fifty percent.
Significantly higher.
Fortunately New Mexico's around
one percent.
So this is a emerging industry
there's a lot going on here this
bill is designed to jump start
this industry allow us to catch
up the rest of the country.
Mexico has lots of sun million
and I think it's essential that
we have this bill so that we can
have a five year it is right in
this part and I want to just say
one other quick thing is that we
look forward to working with the
minerals and natural resources
department to make sure that tax
credits are we are able to be
more efficiently and more cost
effectively in minutes thank you
very much you're.
Others and support.
Thank you anyone else in
support.
Good morning chairman queen
members of the pharmacists are
able to come Public Service
Company New Mexico and we're
supporting this bill is our
artists have some options.
You know we work really hard to
limit our outages and on the
most reliable as possible
portable rates for customers I
think with this with that
restorative just opens up
options not all customers to
during their time of urgency or
just our energies also with the
controls on the grid
modernization.
You know this could help
actually help out the main grid
and that's what we know we the
office for these reasons this
for.
Thank you.
The one else's for so the
committee and the table was the
online.
You're aware of that the people
in the room get up and talk
get picked up by the.
So you can't hear that on the
the webcast
The potential option that they
can walk at this use the
microphone on record.
Yeah I just
Figure out whether and I think
it's a good idea M. as in if
we're gonna be over we have yeah
online is like twenty people.
We do it that way.
also personal figure that.
so never gonna get to the online
testimony really opposition
first.
So if you would if you're online
on this soon.
It would like to speak in
opposition please raise your
hand if you'd like to speak in
support please lower your.
I am not seeing any hands for
opposition.
So let's go to support if you'd
like to speak in support please
raise your hand and we will and
you.
First up we have part of
insults.
The card is already there.
Yes I am can you hear me yes we
can.
Good morning chairman and and
Committee my name's Ricardo
Gonzalez and without Paso
electric sorry I couldn't be
there right now I'm in Santa Fe
but at a meeting that went over
a little bit so I'm I'm Russian
over there but I just wanted to
make sure that that I stood in
support of this of this
measured I I believe as as we
move forward
distribution generation is going
to be a big piece of our
portfolio and being able to have
that dispatchable power is going
to be something as as as we look
more more closely to a to a grid
that that is very dynamic
we were the first company to get
a smart meter
a pass by the by the PRC and we
are working towards that which
which as we move forward will be
a a big a big boost to being
able to use this dispatchable
power for all of our customers
so to that end we support the
measure thank you.
Thank you for that except we
have Barbara Calif.
There can you hear me now yes we
can.
Good morning chairman queen
members of the committee I'm
Barbara Calif speaking for the
league of women voters of New
Mexico the league believes that
government should educate the
public about how to reduce
individual carbon footprints and
should offer incentives to do so
this bill will provide such an
incentive we fully support it
thank you.
Thank you for that anyone else
online would speak in support.
Okay.
seeing uh will go to the
committee members of the
committee.
Yep.
Last year Mr.
You could see that thank you so
much to discussions and
research.
Legislative sessions.
Mr chairman and vice chair of
rules one.
This is the issue.
All.
The the the renewable energy
legislative session the.
For this body on the.
Consist of basically looking
for.
Subject.
Question.
Mr.
Representative Mr koh.
What these folks not able to
compete.
One more question.
We want.
Mr chairman for two weeks.
The chair representative visited
a so the question and I think.
The point that made before is.
Any new technology is obviously
more expensive.
And this is be the case with
everything.
so what we're doing here is
providing incentives could
jumpstart technology that is
expensive now but for use with
cut down the cost.
Which is why it's frequently the
case that the government looking
for subsidy either for the
federal government of the state
of New Mexico defense department
so that these technologies skin
looked out across the.
I use the base of the simple.
Even something that is one data
as well pro.
Was really invented for NASA.
so that asteroids could walk
upside down in the big
distractions that crew was on
and off it was completely new
steps to a thank you and today
you find it on the back like
grant Dr has withdrawn the
shoes.
So if you were to buy velcro in
those days I'm sure you would
have said this is an
if you exorbitantly expensive
he's a small piece of property.
Today it costs not yet pennies
so this is happening here this
is a new technology no doubt
it's going to be expensive.
As it is used for demand is
created for this technology at
the cost to produce it comes to.
So that is what you're looking
for here is to jump start this
technology in the state but
providing a subsidy to make a
cost competitive with other
technologies you can even take
the example of sort of.
I thought it would make sense
postgame Aktiv it houses about
this particular one David down
into like maybe fifty cents of
our.
So that is what you're trying to
achieve here.
Mr Chairman shares.
Which.
Yup.
Finding.
The actual cost the systems.
Most of these providers wanting.
To install this work
these plans.
For all your power.
I did find.
For this for the yes a powerful.
Those.
Home she is precludes run
installed about weapons how
five hundred dollars yes
Representative.
At.
Waited Representative yes that
is pretty accurate of it
fluctuates a little bit but you
on the Bob.
So.
Mr Chairman Senator how would
choose Trish question.
When it comes people people.
People don't.
Please hold to spend their
working families tax low income
tax.
All yes I will so.
How to address the chair on the
conditions of the subsidies for
generally it's very little
people.
That is sure to systems that
will through which was economic
reason to apply.
J. between and Representative.
Again we come back to the state
issue is.
Generally this type of resource
since it is going to support the
energy use more than likely
they're going Google doesn't
have sufficient excess energy
stored in the backseat anybody.
So if you're looking at the
house of that is going to be
four hundred fifty get a lot of
hours a month.
there's really no need for
storage anything the produce
even at the port or the system
will go directly to their lives
and their usage so normally we
target the higher the higher
value applied examples because
the are in a position to produce
more energy than the the.
So typically highincome hold my
tablet get get a water greater
for the work they've system one
that will it's not going to use
that to doing it the only during
the peak sites so that is that
stored in the battery States
able to start that this love our
wall for example that you're not
and that would then be
discharged off be like to
support them all of the.
Like in this wonderful that is
not creating that excess energy
that the that the the operation
the phone having storage is not
there and then you also died
back to the income as you stated
this weather in Mexico bold is
not good spend another twelve
thousand dollars but start was
back.
Which is really what is
happening here is to create that
so should equity we need to go
down discussed the so that
eventually it is affordable by
the much everybody across the
economic spectrum.
That's what we're trying to do.
So.
Mr Chairman district you.
The strategies properly.
For higher income households
with loops four of these higher
income households generals would
be able to.
After the economic.
Which.
So.
Each question if this technology
is compelling.
If it is economic what what do
you school.
All the snow students with
opportunities.
Should we created the presented
the simple economics of rich
people is the this appropriate
money.
So this is for us to introduce
this technology the the the use
the subsidy that is being
provided.
And really the tax liability of
us lower income families this
likely not they have but they
take advantage of this because
this is not a people are
it's not a tax report expects
great.
So you have to have the tax
liability claim that credit.
Which is really.
That's how the situation is but
what is the height of that we
would have to think of tax
credit the state gets.
To use this resource and play
with a gates highlighted the
need for the next five years the
the small lower income will
refuse to do that it's.
Mr chairman the presenters
assist want to respond.
Is it is Mr chairman so.
State right to check this page
education tax.
Mr Chairman we also.
Now which.
To go with your people always
look remotely.
What are.
What are the two on.
The.
Capability you want these are
will systems about thirty one
hours.
Before they get relations starts
to eat into the past.
So.
For eleven thousand five hundred
dollars.
Thirty eight I've lost powers.
Wage all.
Thirty cents okay Page.
This issue.
That would drop to about sixty
percent.
The.
Which means that.
The our system approach.
What can be trained for the
rich.
So.
Question that is absolutely with
help you so please at current
costs no economic reason just
all these.
Which was.
chairman we Representative I've
gone to auction with that.
Because what you're ignoring
here is the type of benefits
that what the utility stopped
about.
Because there's some great
services that the city sources
with the back in storage or find
which is more valuable to that
and that's why we need the kind
of rate structure that
compensates for that value right
now we don't do that.
Are you talking about
excavating the Energy.
Produced by this resource alerts
like we do as a ten years of
thirty eight megawatt hours
reading back to the first
because they do use a good
starting.
Which gives you that thirty
cents are subsidies sixteen
cents but that goes the fact of
the value that this city sources
adding that the great.
Which is why as you have in the
bill if the communication and
control of infrastructure access
in the service providers video
they can make use of the six
which means that by this energy
from somewhere else after the
solar is going down and decided
to stay.
Which is why that value is not
being factored in right now
because that's not how we that
they did
the legislative.
But as we wanted us to great
then that graduate the table
for.
Mr chairman Mr peel I'm also
reflecting the top that you
which.
It shifts over.
Thank you for pushing that
these.
These four million dollars to
charities right the turtles Act
on the issue.
McQueen in a business setting.
Well it is not going to do
anything right but this is an
example of it that's right
losses do this board like I give
a speech to see what the action
benefits this is how it is being
used by the customer and as you
will wonder and how is the okay
by the ability of the other side
of the it could be.
So this story almost right you
get this report every year
you'll be able to see.
How this expatriate was.
Thank you.
So the PSC at some point would
probably again but the
modernization of the great and
that's where the value of the
city associate program.
Mr Chairman street do you you
Representative and then the.
This increased penetration this.
Technology thereby driving the
cost.
To the state.
Hi situation where to close down
the technology is not the what.
Share with me the ticket the
needs of the state as being.
Also active off people would say
that yes the costs hi but I see
a benefit disciplinary.
This is what you do to the plan
right to use this technology.
Because we see that the spots.
Mr chairman Mr chair sure you
are not represented yes so the
impact on.
The.
We visited a small right.
You do is going to affect it but
we read every paper Cup into
road is back to.
Okay Mister chair Mister peel
off and that.
I will say the torsional
Committee C. rose to the right
of the just want to make that
representation.
Thank you Mr that's all I have
thank you to think of the thank
sense covers and Townsend.
Thank you Mr chairman.
The state exit.
Representative.
The bill before us today.
If you.
Yes this in that light yes it
looks like.
Everybody in that database is
supporting the usage of this
city so it's but a small group
of.
What is ignored here is.
Act that you get this resource.
That is being used by a small
group of people actually flows
out of state great.
So you know we if you just do
that back to the Economic
application it might look like
this of the lopsided subsidy
there are larger group of people
the supporting the usage of this
technology but just wanted to.
What is being ignored here is
that the benefit that flows out
of this technology into the
great.
Reduces the cost for everybody
because of what we.
Even in a very small way but it
does have an effect.
Mr Chairman representative I
understand the philosophical
basis for that argument.
But I think you and I both agree
that there's no.
Real point that this system.
Without a subsidy comes
economical.
As economical power supply to
the grid.
Is that correct
J. McLean interpretative I.
Respectfully beg to differ.
Because this is not a
philosophical.
Argue with.
This is an economic argument.
Because the cost of electricity
is calculated across the board
for all state that eight plus.
So if you're using the cost is
really not so much a question of
philosophy but a question of
economics.
So when the PRC calculates the
rate for providing the service
it's what they that group of
people.
Anything that is done to reduce
that create flows through the
entire group but it's being done
by a small group.
Our but they died.
So it is that's where right
equity.
this is that that is used in the
design of electricity dates
comes in.
Because the PRC's job this to
assure that days right equities
everybody.
They do not create.
Economic classification of
income but they do create a
classification of how much
electricity is being used by
individuals across the state
plus.
Backstep according to protect
usage.
I appreciate that
Representative.
That Mr Chairman.
Representative your.
Bring economics at the this.
discussion.
Hi this is me.
A little bit of.
Laughter to be relaunched but
because you and I both know.
Mr chairman and Representative
that.
This does not add.
A dispatchable.
Power source.
Great.
Can be relied upon.
For a constructive benefit.
Over a long period of time it is
a short burst of power.
It can be used.
sometimes but if you and I both
I think we could agree that
there's much more economical
means to find the created with
the dispatchable power stores
they can be relied upon isn't
that correct.
Chanticleer Representative again
hi I agree with you partially.
You can find reliably
dispatchable thank you for seven
a source using fossil fuels yes
indeed that's possible but in
the arena of renewable energy.
A reliable constant box so this
is very difficult by.
That's right with the biz
that'll come in front of you so
as a joke some of it.
Which will provide you that kind
of twenty four seven reliable
power in the end into the new
with energy bucket.
But people out of that bucket.
Then you have to rely either
nuclear or fossil fuels project
ready for seven dispatchable
power.
So your contention.
That this is a small short burst
of power yes integrated floor
are spent just like all the B.
two to four hours but those are
valuable hours.
That is when the grid needs to
support because as the sun is
setting solar is ramping down
with the rapidly.
And that is the guy with the
utility dispatch of this is the
system operations person.
In all the switches yes that is
the great all the Nordic
functions which means it's
choice these are the staff and
of the fuss and feel black which
would be a natural gas.
All may be some other resource
or.
You can see well I have all
these forty thousand factory
setting of the great.
And I can use that power for the
next two hours.
That's valuable to the.
And that is dispatch of the bill
it's there.
But it is therefore limited
educated about which is why no
R. quest.
To move to this modernized great
using renewable energies to look
for a job long duration storage
we haven't got that so it is in
the best of what we have right.
Chairman and.
Representative.
Kill I.
Certainly disagree.
On whether this is the best use
of taxpayers money.
We certainly disagree.
That this brains.
Economics to the create one it
cost is three times what is
available.
On the grid today I mean most
systems.
Our charge and eleven of the
fifteen cents KW.
And this is at least twice that.
And it won't last very long.
And the only way it works.
And then my my biggest concern
with that is not the advancement
of the technology to its highest
support the advancement of the
technology.
But this is not the best use of
those tax dollars.
There are available because it
does not make a minuscule
difference to local warning.
To this to committee of
resiliency of the grid.
It's just another million
shopped.
And it doesn't work.
Long term it doesn't fix
propped.
I I was thinking earlier the
conversation Mr chairman and
representative about the bill
pro deal with any tax dollars
used in the development of the
bill Representative.
Sure that we the second question
is yes it is we that's up eight
point so it is a bachelors was
it a tax subsidy that that the
state of New Mexico provided
Mr chair chairman we
Representative.
I'd be hard pressed to see we
did but as a collective as
everybody was state tax to the
IRS yes some of obligating the
developing that.
Mr Chairman representative.
The people of the United States.
If you could make a really.
Let's start with the date they
supported the development of
bills.
The people of New Mexico I don't
they can really have a lot of
thought about that.
Chair and.
Representative do you know how
many homes in New Mexico you
expect to utilize this process.
Mr Chairman we do not but I do
want to comment make a comment
the store is here to stay two
hundred eleven billion dollars
is is used for energy storage
around the world and it's going
to four and thirty six billion
dollars every industry early on
had subsidies in guests will
still has billion dollars of
subsidies so I think this is
worth our planet's we need
energy storage it's coming it's
going to change as like
everything else get better and
better and more affordable
that's what we're looking at
with this bill and it's not only
residential it's commercial
commercial is used in
Albuquerque Roadrunner Food Bank
uses I'm PED and energy storage
for their but what they need for
their generation so we
I think we have to look at the
long term I know this is energy
storage is here we can go on
about subsidies and with the
state of New Mexico has or
doesn't but every industry is
subsidized in Somers continues
to be subsidized with the
billions of dollars so this is a
small subsidy or tax credit but
it's needed for global warming
for all the things that are
happening in our state.
Thank you.
I appreciate that and then I
think I think you're absolutely
correct
Mr chair and and Representative
but.
Industry whether it be fossil
fuels or whatever industries
that create jobs tax dollars.
A higher standard of living for
all people.
eight reliable source of power
twenty four seven three sixty
five.
The all of those things come in
different.
Transaction value.
Research and development.
Bill Mr Chairman representative
supported by tax dollars.
That burden the most.
the most stressed.
Part of our population to the
benefit of the very wealthy.
I just don't believe is good tax
policy I don't think it's good
for all people of New Mexico and
the.
It it challenges me to support
something like this thank you Mr
chairman.
Representative seven hundred.
Thank you Mr chair
I just have a couple questions
our first question is
concerning.
The.
Financial cost to the state.
Mr chair.
We have four million dollars per
year.
At the rate and then the energy
minerals and natural resources
department indicate they will
have to have an expanded staff
to minister of the program and
so my question is what would be
the cost that would be it for on
the administrative side to
administrate this four million
dollar tax credit.
Mr chair representative I think
that the the skewed numbers that
have been mentioned the
committee analysis
you can.
I certainly understand and
appreciate the difficulty that
we have not has right though.
Lack of suitable budget the lack
of staff what is that pretty
much everything we do in the
energy space of the legislature
also the shoulders to
administer.
And I fully appreciate that.
the weight as we portrayed this
debate this program additionally
complicated.
All of us to do they don't have
to expect this in fact the
federal government could you
Leyba select tax credit doesn't
do not be able to check it out
all the all you do is you find a
schedule just like a any of the
state due to taxable goes into
the are just to give you a
credit.
Are you asking here well and
good to do is is this piece of
hardware.
Nationally certified by a
certified agency and what does
the cross border to the station
it's all this certified.
They do not sacrifice
functionality.
They don't have to certify their
district died but they're just
providing great services they
don't even have to certify with
expected solar existing or new.
All they have to focus on it the
slack box which is certified by
national certified agents that's
it and what was the cost and
that was a construct.
I do not see the need to order
extra FTP to do that because if
you do the math in four million
dollars with the five thousand
dollar credit for residential
budget fifty thousand for
commercial it's very likely that
only about two hundred falls to
to three hundred falls will
apply for this great.
I do not see the need for one
full time employee to administer
the program is certified two to
three hundred falls so it is
that has to be a balance here I
fully appreciate the workload of
the.
They are overworked I guess
staff a good budget.
But that doesn't have to.
The the discussion here that's a
larger issue that the
legislature has to consider.
Mr Chairman also in intimacy all
summer we heard how everyone is
in the funding have specially
you do an indemnity R. so as the
in as being part of AGFC that's
what we're looking at how do we
fund to get to get EMNRD and all
these things that they need and
EDD and all the agencies what
they need and the person they
need so that's what we're
working on so hopefully
we can push for that because we
know we also need to be
inspected we know all the things
that need to be done by EMNRD
that are being done in them
things are changing.
Well Mr Chairman representative
so create another.
Government has be administered
whether takes one person or or
staff people were put in another
strong camels back
with respect to the issue of
with this battery storage our
would be available put electrons
on the grid.
My understanding and I may be
incorrect but my understanding
is that the utility companies.
Bill there are real is to supply
power at.
The.
And if they are supplying power
and have that capability.
How many times a year or maybe
how often would they be point
electrons off these battery
storage.
Disabilities if you will.
Of.
J. McLean and Representative.
yeah absolutely right every
transmission line in the state
it's designed to be.
Provided the but if you see the
utilization of their clients
less than sixty percent.
So.
The power is the most valuable
and most critical box every
utility should support.
So with that the kids every
electron is useful.
And usually that people in the
last four hours at the most.
you I don't know if you've seen
curves that are being put out by
California it's called the
doctor Lee up of the speaker of
in that second the falls off
preservation of the.
Up that is where just eighteen
cents or thirty cents per
kilowatt hour doesn't make any
sense about because you need
that are you have to supply and
you would be.
Hundred dollars a kilowatt hour
to get back if you need.
Because that's when you lose the
system if you go to be checked
out that the massive blackouts.
Usual black out that is what
what people said that support
that is provided in those few
critical hours is ready ready.
Impacts with these batteries
COVID.
So additional four hours you can
easily handle that.
And this is when the utility
does not have to buy power from
out of state look for the
resources to make up that
efficient.
That's what we issued for.
Mr chair.
Mr kill
If I understand your answer.
During that.
Usual peak period is when these
electrons would be pool.
And that's going for very few
days in a year is that correct.
Mr chair representative actually
affected it for occurs every
day.
So as you will the great toward
a new energy.
The other languages waited
solar.
That occurs every evening after
the sun sets.
So it's not.
Location of the this is a need
for the great on a daily basis
so these batteries will be
discharging every gate in the
evening about half state
directly.
To support the great so it's not
a location the parking frequent
occurrence this will occur every
day.
The.
Mr chair with your kids that's
statements only true.
Yes the.
Electrical provider has not
built up it's.
Also the to the.
To those peak levels my
understanding is that all three
of our are regulated with these.
Built up their generation to
meet those peak demands and I
suspect that the whole office
everyone was
the same capacity and so this
battery storage and maybe part
of their of ability to deliver
those electrons come from their
own battery storage if they have
those but we're talking about
individual home right.
Those electrons are going to be
used at last the group can't
handle that to make.
Is that correct.
Mr Chairman representative again
it comes back to the economics
so the decision that's being
made into dispatch through of
the electric utility is drive by
our that is fifty cents per
kilowatt hour by something
that's dirty sense but then what
are or do I use this energy that
sitting in the halls actually
I'm not in pain for.
So that's an economic decision
that's being made victory by
the.
By the system operator.
And that's what you're looking
at here.
So it's not the ability to
deliver the electrons at that
time yes the system can handle
that the.
The electrical load does not
what we talking about this and
economic decision that being
made in the dispatch Federal off
we need to.
And this is being done by
computers right does not even
sitting there looking at the
chart.
Okay this is I can dispatch this
because this is my lowest cost
resource at this time.
Which is why these schools with
batteries with publicly.
The four million dollars a year.
How.
I I guess how much power Mr
chair.
Mr Keogh how much power would be
capable be delivered.
With this up to the.
So is this the chair and
representative this is a very
interesting question.
This is the if you look at that
data system is a very large
number.
But when you actually look at
the great.
Your whole is it I recklessly
small contributor to that logic
the so if you take the stand
back election of holes this is
where the problem stocks.
And battery storage inside a
whole addressing that problem
right with the starting.
But when it does come to the
point that it's such a huge
numbers that looking at
thousands of megawatts of power
but I'm looking at the lights
because that's where it starts
which is why residential
distributed energy storage you
wanted distributed energy
sources more useful because most
of the problems that occur
twelve transmission and
generation level the accord  in
the distribution.
Which is available this.
Which is why this is a resource
that concept of distributed
generation and distributed
energy is.
Very important for us to realize
in this changing paradigm where
we don't have these massive
whole of nuclear power plants
the supporting.
So Mister chair Mister kids up
to these electrons just offset
what's being you like that
private residence or are they
actually finding their way to
the to the group.
Mr Chairman representative it's
entirely up to that actually
disintegration that behind
staff.
But electrons would flow to the
immediate point with their need
so it's quite possible that it
would Pacific reject are
available or if you have a great
connection and the great needs
if they like fill up right so
it's very unpredictable the fact
that so.
It's a big issue.
When we inject power into the
grid at any one point I cannot
predict.
Unless I have a sophisticated
waters which back to school
today that's exactly what's
happening in the whole.
Mr Chairman representative of
our I agree that we are headed
in this direction
And I'm wondering if food would
be more efficient to give the
abilities so.
Regular subsidies given to the
utilities to do.
Larger projects that would have
economies of scale and and if
what we're trying to develop
this this
technology.
Shares may that are are better
of this movie if you will that
might be your term online give
the
Would be better spent in looking
at that we're.
Give a tax credit so two hundred
people can take advantage of
that that's.
There's just one com thank you
Mr chairman thank you members.
Thank you Representative that
refers to is.
Thank you Mr chairman
and Representative Sarinana.
Mr kids you are missed I think
this is a nice to see you we
can.
I do have some questions about.
Just a mass of all of this.
We're looking at two hundred
three hundred homes or
businesses.
Combination.
to be able to leave our current.
Do you have any idea either
interview as to how many.
For
storage units I need to.
Implemented to actually.
sure.
Reliability.
Mr chair and representative.
B. discussion of the logic the
lots of the residencies of a.
If you look at the overall
picture.
And.
The missing some of the
microsurgery since that
happened.
For example.
Mexico has a number of reasons
communities.
And in those communities their
homes with people I would like
somebody to do this.
This oxygen or some other.
Now but that this bill spot or
it's a life threatening
situation.
And if they have storage they
can write to that of the page
without losing lives.
misto that's a very important
situation which.
Madam chair and Mr kill that we
actually have that discussion
here.
Two point two days.
The problem is as pointed out
this is a tax rebate for
wealthy.
Four we not be able to take
advantage of this would still be
in that situation.
And that that is.
But Mr thank you and I'm gonna
try to keep it short side we
have we're trying to get to but
I I.
I believe this problem.
In reality to be able to to
supplement this we need to be
this has to be why.
This tax credit is very such
small.
People could actually.
This.
but Mr Killian Act spoke offline
and you know the company I was
working for last year
was
The chairman of the certified
installer for Tesla.
battery storage tax.
the problem we have right now.
Is the number.
Of people who want them.
Is more than what can be
supplied.
I would just suggest that this
is the.
offering because there's already
exactly.
People are already doing this
without substance.
What this to me looks like ends
up happening because once again
as for my first hand knowledge
of that is that and it's part of
supply.
Changes.
but part of it is just a.
Yes was.
Getting people certified to be
able to to to to install.
There's a backlog one training.
Yes exactly sure I installers.
and then there are of course
that's not the tax system that's
out there.
But.
Already you have more than
enough people who are doing this
with how the subsidy.
It appears that we we just
subsidize folks who are already
turning to do this.
so to me it's it's first of all
first also necessary
There is demand and by the way
across the board you the
interested to know that there
are folks who just want to live
off the grid.
While the somewhere else so so
this is a this is grant alike
would take advantage of this for
different reasons
L. E..
I do believe this time it's it's
on necessary they're the people
who have the where with all are
doing this.
certainly Mr chairman.
Representative and Mr chair.
Is.
Watch this debate about trans.
Transitioning from.
Fossil fuels to renewables.
I said I sat on tax until this
year from the beginning three
years tax.
The discussion was.
We are going to transition away
from fossil fuels which.
As we know was well over fifty
percent of our current budget
which is expanding at a dramatic
rate year over year spending in
four years is gone from six to
six million dollars a year over
year budget to over nine billion
dollars a year of your budget
depending on where we go with
issues budget we can be on our
way to eleven billion dollar
budget year over year.
But what we're trying to
transition away.
From.
Fossil fuels and maybe this is
more questions representatives
of Santa is.
We are continuing.
Every year to see a whole number
of more subsidies to support
more implementation of renewable
sources battery storage
vehicles.
We're doing transition where
energy source or not
transitioning away to a new
taxable status.
We.
To rely on the taxes from one
industry to supplement this at
some point.
The industry that has to start
charging taxes to become self
sufficient.
Especially as we are putting
restrictions and and I have had
conversations with many of you
you.
We would reduce the rate that is
necessary and.
My question is.
What is on point.
What are we gonna start instead
of subsidizing industry which by
the way I know very well this
particular industry.
Is saturated.
Beyond the industry can find.
Is the time that we start.
Taxing.
We have a severance taxes
associated with.
With that at the the separation
I have
The the right the fossil fuels.
that so what we have to consider
something like a.
A tax.
Severance.
So that we have to do that.
And and I just don't see any of
that side when I saw continues
he filed over and over and over
is some more subsidies.
Even when the heart center.
This was an argument we that
that approach for eight years
and it's still the same market
to make it more.
Four.
We have to subsidize.
It appears that we will that
that we we are headed towards.
Doing away with the golden goose
for the goose that lays golden
eggs.
Four eight four source.
That cannot pay for itself
cannot pay our budget expenses.
So that transition.
If it's not going to be on the
renewable energy source has to
be just on tax increases on the
general public.
If we're already the increased
taxes on the general public why
do we not just ask general
public as are transitioning to
the to some sort of battery pack
for solar system for communities
are going to a solar farm for
reform.
I would just not asking them to
stand up pay for it thank you at
the very minimum reduce cost
taxpayers.
Because point isn't cost
taxpayers.
And so as of once that's my last
question Mr chairman that this I
guess you
want when it's time so.
Representative so I I appreciate
the question it's will be on the
screen.
And I I we're not gonna solve
the debate today.
I want to have the.
This Mr chairman.
Alex she's.
And it goes to the court all of
the bills will here including
one that we heard two days ago
Representative Townsend brought.
And.
I don't believe it goes to what
what it goes to this is this
necessary two things is this
necessary subsidy I believe it
is because I know that to find
it.
Yes it is not necessary.
I just need to transition to the
to the industry paying taxes
rather than.
Thanks so I understand you don't
want to have this debate.
And I can understand what.
I believe you don't want to have
this debate because she was part
of the answers so with that
Mr chairman I would just say
remember this is to jumpstarted
industry bring jobs for lecture
shins right this is what this is
trying to do and this first
subsidy is remembered guests
will spend subsidized for many
years and there's still
substance for billions of
dollars so I'm not sure where
where that line item but
The industry pays I far more
taxes that small amount of
subsidies and give we noticed by
the film.
Such an amazing tremendous
budget that we are spending like
drunken sailors thank you Mr
chair.
Someone tell you.
Your comments focus on.
The tax rates are.
Your last.
next up we have Representative
small thank you very much Mr
chairman thank you vice chair
and thank you to the expert
witness Mr chair and vice chair
of expert
there are there workforce
benefits to expanding the
support for energy storage and.
Mr chair madam vice chair
are the is some of the same
workforce involved for these the
specifically for these sort of
individual systems would be
involved and maybe some of the
larger scale systems.
Mr Chairman representative.
Right act thank you for the work
force because right now so that
community colleges offering
courses specialized for the
storage system installation.
does the existing workforce that
does disorder it's like it's
leases like go for that we're
doing this but it creating the
next generation as well.
So there is going to be a beat
for this just like you see that
that would be best for you the
COVID stick the technicians work
for placing the blades about
right those still being from out
of state.
That workforce is a my group
workforce for us basically.
So we have to focus what the
workforce as well because this
is new technology and it's like
very good just because the state
technologies used cars can be
used in the folds and with the
time because of the utility
start baiting lodge stated that
storage save.
Skill sets needed there Mr chair
Representative and an expert
thank you that that that helps I
think it's very positive I think
it goes to one of the really
good points we for is that there
are also benefits to the
economies of scale in this area
so to know that the work force
not only was these installations
but within transportation and
other areas will be building
that workforce with New Mexicans
is very positive
second Mr chair representative
of expert this you've specified
we talked about that this is a
refundable tax credit so
therefore owners in whatever
sort of capacity will be able to
utilize this tax credit even if
their salaries their personal
income
Is it isn't sufficient under
what if it were non functional
so the fact that it's refundable
does that allow for lower income
New Mexicans to utilize this
credit.
Thank thank you Mr chairman
that's yes that's exactly why we
put this.
And you know as a as a mom as a
retired teacher I'm in a limited
budget but the the use of a
standalone system for peak times
as our grid is modernized and we
can we have metering and we have
time to do use this storage
would be great you could know
when to to use that are going to
be used for energy storage so we
don't have those type what.
You Mr chair thank you
Representative and you know I I
as somebody spends a lot of time
out on public land like so many
other New Mexicans to.
Energy renewable energy
generation in distributed
generation approaches and I'm
thinking and solar wells out in
on on on the range land this
this may be an option for maybe
if you're more rural this may be
actually a fairly appropriate
area to for someone to look into
to serve their needs especially
in those times of emergencies is
that accurate.
Mr Chairman yes great thank
thank you Mr chair thank you
Representative
Briefly do you all so that Mr
chair this I guess would be a
COVID earlier this morning we
got a
A sort of a summary of our tax
expenditures by category this is
part of the the nonpartisan
briefings that the body receives
this for FY.
FY twenty one the entire bucket
for environment conservation and
renewable energy it's less than
five percent probably less than
two percent of these are not
broken down by accident it's in
a bar chart here so I can't
don't know the actual amount Mr
chair
Representative members the tax
expenditure year over year from
the state of New Mexico is
minute when it comes to the
environment conservation
renewable energy the we'll look
for to get that information but
to the concerned perhaps that
this is overly supported by the
state the numbers that we were
shown show and in fact that's
not the case I believe that part
of that is outside of the scope
of this.
Representative what are your not
wrecked your order.
These are not the.
Thank you Mr thing
Representative
I think is I I.
Staying within the state and
certainly on the bill and just
looking at the this
the amount of four million
dollars the numbers again that
I'm shown.
Show that that I think this is a
targeted benefit Mr chair it
supports rural New Mexico
perhaps even more than urban New
Mexico Mr chair representative
it helps build a workforce that
we just heard.
Covers many different areas not
just sort of the residential
application for the larger scale
transportation and others
and so for those reasons it
certainly seems like something
that I'm excited to support
thank you Mr chair.
Thank you Representative small
is a very.
Thank you Mr chair
so a new to this committee and
but I do understand tax credits
because I dealt with those quite
a bit it's city council
so I keep hearing that only two
hundred homes are going to use
this but over time that number
would increase is that correct.
So that was my first question
and then the next question is
that I keep hearing that this
will only be for the rich I'm
certainly not rich I was just
which was but I'm not
that is something that I'm
interested in for my own home
you know and and I know my next
door neighbors have done it
and I just think that it's
important that we have in New
Mexico and I did grow up in
northern New Mexico I live in
the metro area
I think it's important to have
right any of different energy
sources for New Mexico because
not everyone lives in the same
areas of the state and there are
you know
There are barriers often in
certain parts of the state for
certain types of work electrical
or and there's some areas that
have solar
capacity at almost three hundred
and L. sixty five days of the
years sell I mean I think that
this is kind of a step in the
right direction because it
provides us
The consumer and I look at
myself as a consumer that is not
wealthy alternate alternative
source of and I think that as
long as we're not sending all of
our energy to another state
which I have been in the past
you know this would benefit
definitely and and and at the
beginning maybe only a small
group of people but at the time
I think it would benefit a lot
of people down the line so I
would definitely support this.
Thank you separata
Representative Dixon.
thank you Mr chair I would move
it to pass second.
It has a second do we have any
of their.
Special.
Representative sorry a certain
unity.
The ticket closing costs
Just one Mr chairman I do
believe this is what we need
this is the third prong to our
wind and solar is energy storage
and them to help us transition
and move towards in the right
direction thank you Mr chairman
thank you to take a look at
this.
Representative Braco.
Representative Dixon yes.
Representative Garcia.
Representative Montoya.
Representative Nibert.
Representative Rubio yes.
Representative Scott.
No.
Representative small yes.
Representative Townsend.
I sure Sarinana yes.
Chairman claim yes.
The six four you have a to to do
that again
What to do with the amendment
new motion.
Okay so we're gonna.
In New Mexico the New.
So the motion would be two
thousand and the.
Thank you Mr chair I move the do
passed as amended second.
Thank you.
Representative break up.
Representative Dixon.
Representative Garcia.
Representative Montoya.
Representative Nibert still on.
Representative Rubio yes
Representative Scott.
Hello.
Representative small yes.
Representative Townsend.
Vice chair Sarinana.
Chairman queen yes.
So saying that the property so
thank you representative
Sarinana thank you thank you
thank you Mr thank you committee
members the judge.
Moving right along our next bill
is as bill sixty seven energy
facilities bonds in gross
receipts.
Representative Chandler
join us at the front.
Thank you.
Taylor soon you're ready people
are exiting if you could Mexico
clean slightly over three.
Representative Chandler.
Thank you Mr chair.
That's my phone doesn't ring.
This on all the time it's okay
Good morning everyone I am here
presenting on house bill sixty
seven and we do have a committee
substitute so I just want to
alert people that would you like
me Mr chair to address it as
though the substitute how would
you like me to some of the
committee substitute for
discussion I move.
Transaction.
Get if you could go straight to
the source to the.
Okay thank you Mr chair in its
point two two four four zero one
point two just so everybody's on
the same page
earlier in the.
Thank.
Is there any of that is Citrix
was wasn't that previous.
so we're on the committee says
to the read the to the two that
are again oh sure it is point
two two four four zero one two.
Thank you and perhaps it would
be helpful if I just told you
what the difference was in the
substitute versus the original
bill and it the substitute
addresses two issues that were
raised in the F. I. R. the first
one being that we did not have a
definition of energy storage
facility and a portion of the
bill that related to the I. R.
B. act and we have provided such
a definition to address that
issue the other issue that we
addressed is
we aronie Asli I would say fail
to include that what the
sometimes called the hold
harmless provisions relating to
the schools and their ability to
get some sort of payment in lieu
of of the property tax revenues
that they would otherwise
receive so I'm sorry about that
but we've we've rectified both
of those issues Mr chair.
Thank you thank you for that by
the differences go ahead and
present bill as.
Well this is this
Can we adopt the committee
substitute for special.
Very objection.
For now
The bill if we do that motion we
will conclusion member to make a
motion on.
Very.
Thank you Mr chair and before I
proceed much further I would
like to introduce my experts in
July of the Tolly in in July Mr
Tolley is senior tax policy
adviser for a group called multi
state associates and she is has
been helping us formulate the
young technical provisions of
this bill I don't see my co
sponsor I was going to introduce
her as well Representative Ortez
is also also on this bill she
may be somewhere else
presenting.
Representative Ortez to this is
committee meets at the same time
oh my goodness.
We live busy lives Mr chair
So this bill is intended to
address a very important issue
related to our policy in the
state and actually country and
perhaps even the world and that
is to advance decarbonisation
enter promote renewable energy
and this bill does that in that
it allows for the application of
the industrial provide bond act
to apply new energy storage
facilities energy that the balls
from renewable energies and it
also provides some tax
incentives along with that
additional tax incentives along
out in terms of gross receipts
tax in terms of the construction
of those facilities
how is that.
Help us well we know that the
state has adopted some renewable
portfolio standards.
And for investor owned utilities
we are looking for forty percent
renewable energy by twenty
twenty five fifty percent by
twenty thirty eighty percent by
twenty forty and a hundred
percent zero carbon by twenty
fifty.
Rural electric co ops forty
percent renewable energy by
twenty twenty five fifty percent
by twenty thirty and eighty
percent by twenty fifty.
In twenty twenty.
The New Mexico legislature
passed SB two thirty three.
Which
Was called the energy grid
modernization roadmap act and it
requires energy and minerals
department to develop an
electric grid modernization
plan.
And in February twenty twenty
one it was a white paper that
was published by the department
it's called grid modernization
from the grid modernization
advisory group.
Which stated without long term
energy storage transitioning the
electric grid to fossel free
generation will be extremely
difficult.
Widespread deployment of storage
will put New Mexico in a
position to fully develop its
renewable resource to serve both
local demand as well as X.
external markets thereby
providing revenue to the state.
And it also it recommended that
New Mexico strategically
deployed battery and other
storage on the New Mexico
correct.
We've we've all had this
conversation I mean this is not
news to any of you on here Mr
chair.
One of the criticisms if you
want to call it that is
Renewable energy's rely on the
sun or the wind and there are
periods of time when it is
sometimes not available so we
need a source of storage and
these are big they can be big
and expensive projects and we're
at a place and time Mr
chairman and committee.
Where incentives will help us
expedite the development of
something that I think we all
many of us agree are is critical
to develop other reliable
renewable energy source and with
that.
I will turn on the floor over if
I may Mister chair to our
experts.
Thank you for the presentation
two four to hear from the
experts we are insure time.
Your last three.
Yes thank you Mr chair and vice
chair Sariñana and members of
the committee for the
opportunity to speak in support
of HB sixty seven.
I'm here representing NextEra
energy resources as a tax
consultant NextEra is the
world's largest generator of
renewable energy from the wind
and sun and as a national leader
in energy storage very invested
billions of dollars with plans
to invest even more in energy
infrastructure across North
America including new wind and
solar facilities transmission
and natural gas pipelines
through twenty twenty one our
capital investment in New Mexico
alone was approximately one
point three billion dollars in
wind solar and energy storage.
Representing about seven percent
of the market share of
electricity sold in New Mexico
we pay local landowners about
two point four million dollars
annually and we pay property
taxes in New Mexico about three
point one million dollars
annually additionally our plans
include about three point seven
five billion dollars of future
capital investment what we ended
energy storage investment in New
Mexico energy storage is needed
to get the most out of those
renewable resources and for that
the state's energy targets as
outlined by German chancellor.
I like to expound on the
benefits that are available to
other industries under the
current statutes.
Counties and municipalities may
enter into industrial revenue
bond agreements with certain
project owners to exempt the
facilities for property tax and
instead enter into agreements
for payments in lieu of taxes or
pilot or travel to spending on
how you want to set up to make
direct payments to the counties
and local jurisdictions.
Incentives available to among
others electric generation and
transmission facilities but not
to energy storage.
Once an IRB agreement is in
place counties and
municipalities can purchase
through an agent wind and solar
electric generation equipment
free of gross receipts tax the
savings directly benefits the
the projects that are the
subject of the IRB agreements
under that's under separate
statute.
HB sixty seven would simply
extend these currently existing
benefits to energy storage
facilities and energy storage
equipment this tax incentives
have played a significant role
in the development of renewable
energy industry in New Mexico
and similar support is needed to
encourage the development of
energy storage facilities that
are needed to modernize New
Mexico's correct.
Energy storage provides many
benefits in addition to meeting
the states for renewable
portfolio standard some examples
are balancing load on the grid
protecting equipment and
controlling voltage and
frequency.
Renewable integration such as
filling in gaps resulting from
intermittent resources like wind
and solar take demand reduction
transmission capacity and
congestion really.
Integrating distributed energy

Quoting again from the EMNRD

Development in New Mexico can
attract battery companies to
locate in New Mexico and make
New Mexico attractive to other
industries as well states are
competing for capital investment
dollars and some of New Mexicos
neighboring states have already
enacted incentives to benefit
energy storage.
many exams generation equipment
and certain energy storage
equipment failure to pass HB
sixty seven will result in New
Mexico continuing to bid on a
competitive disadvantage for
those reasons we ask this
committee to support H. B. sixty
seven encourage the development
of storage a critical component
to the future infrastructure of
the state.
We just carbon targets and
further economic development in
the state and with that I'm
happy to take any questions.
Thank you both will we'll go to
the audience
It is always respectful
increases
this year anyone in the audience
who would like to speak in
opposition to the state.
Is there anyone in the audience
would like to speak and support.
Good morning chairman many many.
The adviser for the energy
minerals natural resources
department and we are as our
said.
Very much in favor of.
Aging and.
Okay yes Mr chair members of the
committee my name is Allison
Smith registered lobbyists for
NextEra energy resources and we
stand in support of this bill we
feel the sponsor and your expert
have explained this bill very
clearly just want to reiterate
that energy storage use very
important if we're going to be
our best part of the mission of
goals thank you so much.
This
Chairman representative in
refugee Alliance stands from.
Chairman the housing workers and
natural resources that sounds.
Yeah what's good was going to
with the secretary of the
chapter negative forty with too
many details we also stand
support and ask for your thank
you.
Good morning Mr chairman and
committee members look great
live as you do on that so
I I we stand in support of this
bill we believe that it allows
for utilities to to take part in
the IRB process on on this on
this bill and that's a very
important thing as we look at
economic development in our
territory our territory New
Mexico we have very little
industrial loan and this can
help with that and one of the
things that we're looking at
with the new policies of New
Mexico and it's and it's twenty
forty five goals of of the RTA.
Is that we have.
Different customers state that
we did before.
We have retail customers who are
our most of our customers those
are every day customers those
are
What the Rubio are are
Representative smaller
Representative in all of our
other customers but we also
have.
Responsibility to to be bringing
in economic based economic
development into our area that
is looking for carbon free
entities and and the third link
to that is the ability to export
we renewable energy out of the
state.
And in our territory we have a
we have a a transmission issue
bottleneck we do think that this
this bill will be able to help
us on on that and as we look for
those of those new partners to
the probably the most
aggressively competitive area of
the state when you look at
having el Paso on one side of
the desert and New Mexico on the
other so to those ends we're
supporting the thank you.
Thank you yes I.
Morning Mr chair members of the
committee just with everybody
Mexico State University.
For those of us.
More.
This will provide us with
additional opportunities one
projects.
Cation the issue is is.
Thank you.
Yeah Mr chair.
That is why we.
Back on.
this this is on the other side.
If you would like to opposition
to this bill please raise your
hand.
And see hands if you'd like to
speak with this bill.
And seeing none.
will go to the committee
Representative Townsend.
Thank you Mr chairman
thank you for Representative.
For more expert witness NextEra
has three point seven five
billion dollars investments in
the in the works in New Mexico
is that correct in our pipeline.
Not necessarily under
construction or development gap
that enterprise.
And.
Mr Chairman representative can
you estimate the benefit of this
bill to your company
economically.
I don't have specific Mr chair
Representative Townsend I don't
have specific figures
but we have
It has benefited our renewable
development over time on the
solar and wind side and I would
expect similar benefits from
this bill I don't have dollar
figures related to that
investment plan.
Representative.
Some some.
So there's been no pro forma
done your testimony is you have
no pro forma the estimates the
benefit of this bill to a
project I don't have that
information Mister chair
Representative Townsend.
Mr chair representative.
At and Representative this is
for you have you estimated the
cost.
The but the cost is for the
state.
The IRB process to a three point
seven five billion dollar
project.
Mr chair I I first of all I
don't believe there's a project
I believe the testimony of our
expert Mr chair was they have
been investing X. amount of
dollars in the state on projects
not in this particular energy
storage project and I think
Mr chair and representative the
property need to be doing
economic analysis is the LFC and
LESC has prepared FIR that
discusses the fact that without
having a project in place it's
difficult to estimate
the amount of tax expenditures
associated with the project if
that was your question Mr chair
and representative.
thank you for that
Representative chair.
Is it.
I have a.
Background in large projects.
I have never used in our the.
The benefits of the state to the
entity acquiring the I. R. B..
Is what.
Mr chair the way I would think
about it is
that the government is providing
an umbrella.
For certain tax relief is that a
fair statement Mr Tolley or
would you like to answer more
specifically nine million Mr
Chairman representative of the
our government entities takes
what we often refer to as bear
titled to the project and they
become the owner of for.
Purposes of the property tax
exemption so that government
entities not subject property
tax and therefore they don't pay
property tax at the same time
the project entity and the local
government entity negotiate
a mutually beneficial payment as
a as a pilot agreement.
Chair and representative but is
it also true that during
construction there is
significant.
Tax
benefits to the to the project
in the construction cost.
Mr chair representative well
that's what the bill is
proposing of course certainly
through the if the Iraqi people.
component would provide some tax
relief and the bill also
proposes and G. R. T. deduction
which would provide some tax
relief and so then these are
expensive projects which I
would expect they are that's
probably why incentives are
necessary
certainly I can imagine that the
to some could be.
You know cell number of millions
of dollars.
So let's see if we can quantify
that a little bit on on.
One of my colleagues is.
Run the numbers on the.
Typically launch would not
projects like this was large the
trans my experience is that.
About fifty percent of it is
materials and about fifty
percent of it is.
Labor and.
So.
three point seven five billion
dollars divide that by two by
that time six percent that's a
hundred twenty five million
dollars up in the to the
proponent on the project Mr
chair representative with all
due respect that would not be
correct because the three point
seven five million
Representative.
A billion sorry represents our
entire
line of kind of investments with
our plant potential investments
which includes wind solar and
energy storage probably the bulk
of that is the wind and solar
which already enjoys the
exemptions that we're talking
about so the impact of this bill
would be much much smaller than
that and I get I get that I
appreciate that chair but my my
point is.
That a lot of the the loss to
the state.
In gross receipts.
Versus the P. all paid to.
the local.
introduce in lieu of that
property tax.
Is a significant shift to the
state versus what the county may
benefit.
Mr chair representative you can
look at it that way but I would
also point out that without the
incentives you may have no
revenue from certain projects if
they don't get built because
they're too expensive or because
the the competition from other
states to build
makes it more attractive to
build their.
So that's interesting Mr chair
and representative.
I believe that this is a make or
break
in the economics of the project
is is a proponents ability to
get and I are the.
Mr chair representative I
believe it can be I am multiple
decisions obviously there are
multiple.
I'm very bills that go into
these things and looking at them
in different states I know that
some of your neighboring states
have incentives for these types
of in investments
And
You know we take those things
into account we have to that
these projects often into our
issues and we get beat out
sometimes or wind by pennies on
the dollar the different bills
so they can be the difference in
winning a bid and building a
project we're not winning at
that not building the project.
So Mr chairman and
Representative.
Thank you.
Believe that the.
Thank.
Mr chair and representative is
there anything in your bill
that.
That causes a proponent.
To guarantee that of creating
jobs in the Mexico because
that's what I are really
designed for he said just is to
create jobs in New Mexico
Mr chair I did not see that.
And I did not say anything about
creating jobs what I said was Mr
chair that this is an incentive
to help support the development
of energy storage in the state
and that without such an
incentive there is a likelihood
that it would not happen and
that would impede our ability to
meet our renewable energy goals
that have been adopted by the
state.
That's I believe what we both
sat Mr chair so Mister chair and
representative it's your
testimony today is that it
should not create jobs and New
Mexico Mr chair I didn't say
that either.
So Mr chair and representative.
The tax dollars in minutes this
certainly takes tax dollars away
from the state.
I mean the I. R. B. I mean if
you go back and look at any
projects every used in our B.
and I'm I'm familiar with the
number of them.
Every one of them are at the
detriment of the state to the
benefit of a lot of a local
government because they are able
to quantify bills and property
tax calculations to the benefit
of that local location and what
the state gives up.
In order to do that is gross
receipts tax at least and the
benefit if you go back and leave
read the act in many of the
other.
Jobs and projects that occurred
in New Mexico they have created
jobs and that is the that's how
the state gets whole is in
personal income tax more
employees you know building
homes and stuff like that these
projects will is there any
guarantee that these private.
Is there is there reason to
believe.
That there will be a significant
number of new jobs.
I am a proponent of the storage
project.
In New Mexico will will that
create jobs in New Mexico Mr
chair and representative there
two points of course we all know
that there are jobs associated
with the construction of the
facility but we all know that
secondly
being the world that it is now.
There are many companies that
have to evaluate whether they
are meeting their environmental
goals and their decarbonization
goals and what draws them
potentially to a state like ours
if we can develop a strong
renewable energy source is the
the potential for there is those
companies to locate here and
that in turn creates jobs is the
Tolley did I miss anything.
If I may Mister chair
representative I Mr chair and
Representative Townsend I think
you stated it very well part of
the many many companies have
committed publicly to sourcing
all of their energy needs from
renewable
Publicly stated eBay Microsoft
Google many others and to
attract those businesses hundred
datacenters and all the jobs
that come along with that.
Renewable energy accessibility
and the price of renewable
energy is often in a
the factors that
influences where they locate
those businesses so while the
renewable energy or the storage
project itself may generate a
limited number of jobs and it
does create some jobs it's
limited
besides the hundreds of
construction jobs
it does have Representative
alleged acts that that have the
ability to create jobs in other
industries that are attracted to
the state.
And and under in the white paper
that was mentioned M. and R. T.
specifically states that it
would attract battery companies
battery manufacturing companies
and other industries to the
state.
Well Mr chair and sent out of
the Representative I I I.
I am concerned.
And I think all New Mexicans
should be concerned.
That I. R. B. use on on a
project that does not read does
not.
Create.
Long term the department jobs.
At the cost of the G. R. T..
Greatly benefits the proponent
of the project and not the state
and that's my job is to try to
protect the state I am I have
and will continue to be a big
proponent of jobs I don't care
from what industry they come
from.
But using an I. R. B..
To shield a part of the.
From.
Gross receipts taxes at a huge
cost to the state was not
Highs to.
And no guarantees that they're
going to create so many jobs.
It really it's difficult chair
because many of these rural
counties are impacted by this
they don't have much tax base
and I can get it they're looking
for any way in the world.
To build roads and sidewalks.
And
these large projects in four PM
eight kids.
That gives them more than they
had.
But the state loses a ton of
money.
And it's millions and millions
of dollars.
And there's no guarantee in most
of these are both the you met
some that this higher B. have.
provision had been modified last
year so that the power lines
could be included.
That is an absolute.
Example of what I'm talking
about there's a lot of
construction jobs that go into
building of and there's not
hardly a single long term job.
The state.
Most of that power.
It's not even concerned in the
state.
So we're used in New Mexico tax
dollars to support the.
At the detriment of the State.
Or one of our neighboring states
and that is my issue I I I'm a
big proponent of our basic
create long term jobs but yes.
As I see it.
And as I read it makes no
provisions for long term jobs we
talk about it creates these jobs
in that those jobs.
But
if you could tell me that this.
Yes particular I. R. the
provision would create a
significant number of jobs but
we're.
It worked out to where the state
benefit and I could see that pro
months ago for.
But I don't think it does and I
think.
it's a great deal for proponents
great deal for.
Of people that own stock in the
company that's doing that.
It is for those.
Counties to get a little bit
thank you Mr chair.
That are.
Thank you Mr chair
That is up with Robert for is
that I understand that two five
four energy storage facility
about this up we point out that
neither page three line thirteen
through sixteen your face here
begin at line nine those
legislative definition of that
term.
so that was the purpose of the.
We need to look at that
the other board the logic Mr
chair is I because of the
presence of the expert witness
I'm.
Not sure I think I need to stay
in from the vote I am trustee of
the trust that has a substantial
investment in the Exterro
because this seems to be
somewhat specific to the
thank you and I probably need to
do so.
Representative Nibert.
I I appreciate that
It's it's up to you we we of
course will have the stitching
column so if you would like to
not those you probably
to excuse yourself and we show
this excuse.
Thank you Representative small.
thank you very much
Mr chairman thank you madam
chair thank you to have Sir
Mr chair representative
The.
Energy storage would be use it
your some of your testimony was
that this would that be sort of
foundation for diversely both
regional and the state economy
can you elaborate a little bit
about hound Mr chair
representative
reliable carbon free affordable
energy is a core part of
diversifying our economy.
Well I think Mr chair and
representative we pointed to the
fact that there are a number of.
Large and important and
significant companies that have
within their.
or right goals and
Values the need to
Limit their carbon footprint.
And by developing reliable
renewable energy sources that is
a draw for those companies and
maybe Mr the public could add to
that she cited a number of
companies like Google and so on
who have such corporate
policies and they look for ways
to meeting to meet those goals.
Representative chair Mister
chair I I don't really much to
add to that the big
The addition of new industry is
is good thing and give
diversifying the economy
we can never replace
just revenues when I'm trying to
do that but we believe that we
can attract a lot of other
businesses into the state that
would contribute to that.
Thank you very much Mr chair
thank you Representative and
thank you expert at that point
is is tremendously important and
certainly the communities where
I come from the growth in border
related trade and investment in
manufacturing.
The stable carbon free.
Energy is a core part of what
folks both great in terms of the
companies that you know I think.
Really across sort of the
private sector are and will
increasingly look to the
connected to it so Mr chair I
just want to reemphasize and I
appreciate the testimony that
this is a core part of
diversifying new Mexico's
economy providing reliable
carbon free energy is the it is
fundamental to our economic just
should versification Mr chair
Representative.
Do you see it as a positive
thing as I do that rural
communities perhaps benefit
inordinately from this approach
given their ability to
build in stable sustainable
sufficient revenue sources for
their populations through an
industrial revenue revenue bond
agreements with that are large
with the private sector.
Mr chair and representative yes
and I think
even alluded to by
Representative Townsend it will
draw these facilities most
likely to chairman rural areas
where there's lots of room in
space that will provide a tax
base or excuse me that will
provide alternative funding
through the bills and.
And that will provide revenues
to the local governments as well
as the schools.
Thank you Mr chair thank you
Representative and of these
revenues that are they just for
one year or these are great
agreements for a longer term
period think it's a longer term
is that thank you Mr chair
representative Mr chair and
representative small they are
long term agreements typically
as long as the power purchase
agreements there are a number of
benefits to that rural small
communities often don't have a
lot tax expertise yes our
servers our system there this
this of weights
Appeals that avoids the need to
hire outside parties by the
assessor to do assessments these
are stable payments over a long
period of time I would it gives
the local governments certainty
and adjustability Mr chair
representative experts that.
That sounds great to me the the
ability to
allow and really encourage and
facilitate rural communities
across New Mexico develop
sustainable long term sufficient
revenue sources for services
that are important to them and
to their the people who live
there.
And diversifying new Mexico's
economy by providing clean
reliable energy
What.
There are those are strong
positives Mr chair
representative and expert
and and those along with our
very stable
Economic and Revenue outlook as
a state currently these are this
is a tool that you in my opinion
Mr chair representative just for
my closing comment.
We're expanding a tool that is
building whether it's sidewalks
whether it's roads whether it's
supporting EMS services whether
it's supporting school
expansions in communities
through the IRB tool currently
for transmission and other areas
we're expanding this to on the
energy storage so we're given
these local communities another
tool
it's gonna Mr chair
representative allow them and us
as a state to diversify our
economy
in the those are really strong
and sufficient reasons for me to
support this thank you Mr
chairman.
Thank you Representative House
followers and stuff.
Thank you Mr Robbie.
Research.
Your experts.
Representative.
To.
Exter ahead three point seven
five billion these projects in
the pipeline.
I don't Lee are hurt.
How much.
Of that total expenditure was.
would be dedicated to this long
term storage I'm still.
Trying to get to a number the
the cost to the state if we.
Mr chair representative I I'm
sorry I don't have the breakdown
of that
off the top of my head or in my
notes
I don't have that information as
to what the breakdown is of that
three point seven five million
dollars.
Between wind solar and storage.
Mr chair and representative as I
believe
Is the tallest prior testimony
was it is a significantly
smaller percentage of this
number and transmission lines
and other things that next year
is working on my correct about
that for calling yes.
Yes Representative my under my
understanding of that numbers
that it primarily represents
wind solar and storage but that
the bulk of that would be the
wind and solar and some portion
of it would be storage but I
just don't have the exact
breakdown of that pilots Act.
Mr Chairman.
I would.
To
listen to.
Thanks.
We.
Storage project with restraints
yes.
How much the tax abatement.
Right the.
The.
What long.
Fund.
Mr Chairman.
Representative what.
The specifications for.
Long term storage the.
Yes.
Hello all these facilities tend
to.
Our objectives were giving it
up.
When she all.
Mr chair just for clarification
Representative Scott do you mean
how long is the energy stored
how what's the maximum
capability of the actual
facility is that what you're
asking.
Sorry nope Mr chairman to.
Last four.
How long these batteries provide
power to to.
Eight other.
Shortchange.
The wind.
Or so.
Mr chair representative are you
referring to like on a daily
basis.
If the wind power if the wind
isn't blowing how many hours
with the Mr Chairman.
Madam chair that is exactly the
question how will you to the
special.
Provide health there's no.
Charging to wind chill is not.
I'm a I'm a tax expert and not a
technical expert and but I will
say that that
answer depends on the
configuration it depends on the
equipment I believe today the
standard is somewhere between
four and eight hours
but again I I cabbie ought that
by saying that is not my area of
expertise.
If I may Mr chair and
representative I I just look
back at my notes and I actually
do have a bit of more
information on the three point
seven billion dollars
Our estimate and again these are
Actions of potential projects
but we're looking at about a
billion and a quarter and solar
and storage together and about
two and a half billion winds up
going forward at that three
point seven five billion that we
mentioned.
Mr Chairman.
No Representative Townsend.
Specifically of the.
Expenditures with respect to
storage.
I don't have a very soon between
the storage and the us seller's.
Just two more questions Mr chair
madam chair.
Is there anything so I
appreciate it.
Economic development which is
there any current.
Conversation on.
Sure.
This our.
That would.
Latest waves terrace.
Something in the pipeline.
That would.
Contribution.
Okay if you will the tax.
Do we have anything on the.
Or contemplated that you could
speak to today that would.
Just I you mentioned.
Respect to these.
Mr chair I I I'm not I apologize
Representative I'm I'm confused
by that question I.
Genuinely so.
Mr chair.
What rates.
Yes consumer electricity signed
a contract is a consequence of
what we want they do we care to.
Okay Mr chair I just my experts
is there a contract in place
By I guess an internet company
like the power company or call
up that has been talking with
that it has a relationship with
next year I guess Mr chair and
representative not to my
knowledge.
Thank you for your insurance.
Representative Sarinana.
Chairman.
Do not pass for house bill sixty
seven.
A pastor House Energy
Environment resources.
Browse sixty seven.
The motion and a second in the.
For the discussion.
Hi this is a very good if you
can keep the free but the
perfect.
And.
Mr Chairman I do have some
concerns about this bill I
really can't and I just want you
guys to know that I do have a
lot of experience with higher
Iraqis and I just want to stand
for what it is I'm going on here
so understanding that you are
proposing.
In lieu of.
The tax that goes to a school
that
That they would receive.
in lieu of paying tax payments
to school districts they would
receive.
If they're involved in in one of
these facilities storage
facilities the municipality or
the community they wouldn't they
would receive the
The income provided in lieu of
the tax that goes to the school
is that my understanding so
instead of the the higher the
I guess because it up and and I
R. B. will provide some tax to
the municipality and then it
would go to the school correct.
Mr chair representative
the the I. R. V. would exempt
the project from property taxes
and then there would be a
payment in lieu of the taxes
that would go to the local
jurisdiction and.
This in accordance with the
committee substitute the school
districts which share in that
pilot payments Madam okay is
there any has there been any.
Used to go through the check
Mr chair
The
regular due to address the chair
before you ask a question that's
correct okay.
Just keep going back okay that
Mr chair.
so in terms of
Has there been any analysis done
that would show an example of
how much money the district
would lead receive
in lieu of the tax.
Forfeiting the tax.
Mr chair representative
that's a difficult question to
answer because the pilots are
negotiated between the parties
so until that negotiation you
know is completed and the amount
is known
really.
Answer that question Mr chair I
guess there's not been as shows.
And that's that's really my
question.
I don't see it in the Mr
chairman and.
I'll see report.
The staff.
Mr chair and representative.
The the the
I think it what the expert was
saying is until there is a
project that is negotiated with
the county with the local
government
we don't know what the
arrangement with that local
government will be therefore we
look does not know what the
arrangement with will be with
the schools.
Mr chair
Representative to.
Yes my question would be.
is there any modeling that would
show how this would work.
Mr chair at.
To my knowledge not for this
particular modification to the I
RB I am unaware of any modeling.
So.
Thank you.
Any further discussion so we
have a motion you do not have
the ability to pass committees
substitute
state to take a look.
Representative very go.
I.
it's it is a two passed motion
so yes to pass the committee
substitute though to not pass.
Representative Dixon yes.
Representative Garcia.
Representative Montoya said just
because Representative numbers
are you intending to vote on the
school.
Thank you please excuse yourself
from the roof I think you're
present in the room it's
incumbent upon you to vote.
It is a several brokerages
what was.
We don't have the.
Extension I don't know what your
forms of the yeah I know what
the rules for.
Lots of our last action I mean
if you to excuse yourself we can
figure it out with okay.
Representative Rubio yes.
Representative Scott.
The.
Representative small yes.
Representative Townsend.
I share Sarinana yes.
Chairman claim yes.
So by the the I agree you have a
Senator committees thank you Mr
chair to thank you committee
thank you Committee asking for
space on the floor one second.
There.
J. R. would request.
The report reflects.
The right to act to state anyway
somewhere the report.
That's not something the other
for you to be shown as it's used
as Representative Garcia.
will be meeting Saturday will be
Sir and I thought.
It could be a long day.
Thank you Richard.
Right.
At
the table okay.
Hi
yeah we've been talking to
