Let's get a little bit of
business done before we.
Just start the conversation.
Tax credit bills.
Okay so a role that's my
understanding you have about
five minutes.
Coming down here
telling talking to us about this
issue that spent festering for
about a week with us we're
hoping to date.
The.
The.
You know thirty days session.
Bills vetoed from.
On the authority and p.
To three subjects.
Two bills drawn pursuing.
Further more article four s.
Like the house.
Yeah.
That's exactly.
Ill with the under.
So you know if we can't even
ever introduce an exact bill
then surely we have.
It sounds like a catch twenty
two.
Madame chair and members.
The.
The constitution provides that
in a.
Regular session
we have interpret that to mean
that you take the bill that was
returned to the sector of state
called back to the respective
house of origin and mov.
And that is what's required in.
To introduce a bill that was
vetoed
as a new.
The.
Would have underscoring and
strike through its no longer the
bill that the governor beat up
the bill of the governor.
So it's either
a message or
we're moving to override.
Madam chair and center no you're
correct there is no caseline I
mentioned that there are no
supreme court decisions.
Just later requested.
I think you.
Yes looking at section five sub
paragraph b there's a there's a
critical word in there that I to
me does.
Open things up a bit and it's
the word consider.
And so consider means subject to
the legislat.
For example I have the governor
gives a message on a bill.
We have the right during the
legislative process to consider
th.
The.
And I just i'm having a really
hard time reconciling.
The use of that that words if
we're considering bills.
Discretion apply to allow us to
for example take a bill veto.
With a message that spells out
exactly what the issue she has
with it introduce it again.
Might be a little different on a
two o two number or.
And then in effect to do what we
do with any bill we consider
what she said.
For her then to obviously decide
whether we've been enough
considering on that bill for her
to sign it or white frankly she
could.
The other provision in the
constitution which is the
override so i'm just having
trouble.
Kind of saying that this
language just basically
reaffirms what in section twenty
two which is the override versus
actually creating an ability to
fix something why.
Limit our ability to address a
really important issue that an
executive has unilaterally
decided they don't like and so
they don't give us a message.
For lots of reasons we can't get
a two thirds vote which is as
the heightened threshold and
basically.
Represent our left
the next sixty day session
before we can even consider that
issue again.
So I guess i'm just that that
word consider.
Is what and trying to fix things
while we're trying to do here is
not.
Trying to override as much as we
want but we all know the
political d.
And so it just feels like this
is a way to address something
that the governor has flagged or
maybe there's not a message but
we come back in and and we fix.
Which in the end we're trying to
pass good legislation
just just some thoughts and
maybe you've got a response
managed here and senator
I actually.
Look at the word consider and it
went down a rabbit hold frankly
that i'd never quite got out of
it never completed my journey
there but their worst some
discussions in
cannon's precedence which is
something the use house of
representatives looks at and
something that's referenced in
one of the.
Six year nineteen seventy where
consider was looking at not just
consider but reconsider and
whether or not for example if a
governor could if governor were
to veto a bill that immediately
came.
It would still have to overwrite
it by two thirds it could.
One of them but again I went
down that rabbit hold didn't
finish going through that I
believe I have always tried to
put the legislative program.
Those which I understand.
Much of an authorities case law.
And based on everything I heard
read that they former
paul attacked john boller john
yager myself and others have
looked at.
The authority to look at that
and the proced.
Again in mason.
And that's again my
interpretation
just just one of the thing that
I think was in the aid the
second age of being a opinion
that jumped out at me
and they were trying to deal
with the situation could a
alleged one house override a
veto in a sixty day session and
then the next time.
And do the second part of the
override.
Though but different sessions
and they focused alone on
section eleven each house may
determine the rules of its
procedure I mean it feels like I
mean if if the direction.
The.
Consider th.
How we're going to address.
Again there's a constitutional
provision that allows us to do
that and I think I agree
complete the center back up.
We always used to joke about you
know have to like the lawyers in
the legislature you know can
write a lot of opinions as well
this issue ultimately probably
needs to get resolved by accord
if someone's going to challenge
it.
But why wouldn't we.
You led.
I just think we've got a
situation now we're this has
been used by the other chamber
over the years to allow bills to
be german.
As we've always kind of
respected the rulings of the
other.
And I think the question is do
we sit and continue to not
allow.
Pass a joint rule which I think
is what.
Madame chair and center of the
onto.
The.
Article four section eleven that
does provide the legislator each
house with.
So.
There's only a procedur.
The law recognizes the word.
We've debated here what the word
consider means that's an emp.
Yeah.
When there's ambiguity.
There's no doubt.
Ten of the.
And and that becomes pretty
critic.
The.
Really.
Worth was being.
Things to say.
I I don't know.
The.
Madam chair and senator you're
correct and agi opinion is not
binding regards to who asperit
the only thing is that the
legisla.
And secondly to your point about
intent.
There's no intent written in two
c.
Always been my understanding
that the intention of.
Sessions
when I appreciate that in some
of us included have been fr.
Limit the scope of a thirt.
Of a compromise.
I would s.
This in a court challenging
believe it or not even as a
lawyer i'm not a big fan on
relying on.
The easy soluti.
Restriction of.
So manager my understanding is
that there is a house.
You can.
Introduced.
Uh technical changes l.
And they are proceeding as I
understand it I represent
mcqueen how to specific bill on
the game commission but he
brought several times to the
rules committee.
The appropriat.
Yeah.
So we don't get a situation.
Where were then as the senate I
mean if we didn't do.
That have been.
And I think it's good for the
body to be consistent.
Flagging this issue I was there
and twenty twenty one.
Had been there after that I
would note that speaker egoph on
a number of occasions.
This provision that
constitutional.
So it's an issue that's been out
there but.
And I appreciate center worth
comments but i'm a little bi.
So we'll we have to move forward
but I would like us to move
forward with the.
I'm not saying we have to do
that.
I think.
But but I share your c.
Bills of the previous regular
session vetoed by the governor
it doesn't say exactly it
doesn't say except for the two o
two number it doesn't say
anything else.
So as we move forward I just.
I would prefer that we work with
the hous.
I agree with you on your.
Joint rule that says there is.
The bill actually.
So so I was just going to say.
So you could still reference the
original two or two number then
you have the vers.
Another.
Extension to it but helped you
track the bill all the way.
The.
I believe what you're asking is
should there be a
an indication at the end of the
two or two number because we
all.
Or governor
and so it would be helpful I
think for two reasons one for
the
signm.
Secondly for the public to know
that.
Some indication would be
helpful.
Acc.
Madam chair and center that's
one indication that the other
that is unclear night don't
have.
I don't know what changes.
Thank you manager.
For a constitutional revision
commission this is a great
opportunity to really pl.
There are two things that I
think are important one is from
our very first meeting of this
committee.
Structures mears you can
delegate things and i.
You have to have clear
instructions.
What we're delegating to them.
Clear about this issue.
I've been hearing.
Rule them as your because what
three of them
they're diff.
Rather th.
This was fifty eight was part of
the v.
They're very definitely not just
the same.
I would like us with this
conversation we've had two.
About the instructions.
Appropriations where you got.
Without even going.
Rest.
I thought that d vantage.
One twenty six is not attacked.
A revenue.
We'll get a copy of the house
memo when we'll bring it here.
I feel like I know where we're.
Yeah.
Madame sharing members I
appreciate the optionally to
discuss.
With the constitution says thank
you for that but I assume you're
done with.
We're not done with.
So.
Thirty every day hopefully most
days it'll be a few minutes
yesterday it would have been a
minute but we never got a chorum
so that just delays another day
