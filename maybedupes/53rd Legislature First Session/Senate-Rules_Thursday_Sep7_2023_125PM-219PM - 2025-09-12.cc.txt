Thank you chairman Duhigg and
so thank you Senator fenics

for 3 re appointments in the one
appointment to the children's
trust fund board of trustees
and so if you want to do
an introduction of each of the
4 conferees and
then 8 each of the 4 of
you do a
brief statement
to the committee and then if
there's anybody here in support
or opposition will go to that.
And then we'll and out with that
questions or comments from the
committee and thank you for joining
us this afternoon.
Thank you Mr chair first
I'm going to introduce
is Alexis shin
a due to
due to check.
Is that correct
deduction do don't
check okay
and she
is up for appointment
to the.
Children's trust fund board
of trustees
which was founded
by the First
Lady Alice king many
years ago
and one of our nominees
sitting to my left is actually
a grand child of
the
former us so
we'll get to that in a minute
but missed doodle
check is
a family and children's
attorney totally
understands some
of the issues that the trust
fund board is trying to
address and you will hear more
from her in a minute.
The next person I have
is Bridget
Kathleen Schneider
Mr Schneider is
actually a social worker
another person with a lot of
background in
working with the
issues of the trust
fund board.
Next I
have.
Tracy Michelle
Neff who
is retired from
San Juan County
and she brings a geographic
perspective to this
Trust Fund board as well
and as I mentioned
Stacey Renee king
who also brings a
geographic perspective
but also a heritage
perspective I know the
family will have a lot of
expectations of
her on this a trust fund
board but she her
background is in
beef as a
ranching family
in a rural community
she was on a school board
and she has a background
in working with children and
also really state
so Mr
chair I think that each
of them would like to say a few
words.
Thank you shinning
thank you.
Thank you for having us this
afternoon.
Now you.
Thank you for having us
this afternoon
it is been an absolute
honor and privilege to
be appointed
on the children's trust
fund it's
been exciting to
be able to.
Both Representative
and
help the fund
create opportunities for more
funding and awareness
across the state
and
so our goal
today is to
this in addition to being appointed
to continue the work that we've
been doing it particularly
in this interim period
before full appointment
on a number
of avenues to
raise our
revenue
and gain awareness
of our license plate in
particular
so those are just some
brief words
okay.
Pretty.
Thank you chairman
to Hagen vice chair on a
meal and other senators for
letting us be here to stay I've
had the honor of being partners
hello my name is Bridget Schneider
I'm a social worker at
UNM hospital
I've worked in the pediatric
clinic prior to
that I worked in treatment
foster care so I spent
the good part of 20
plus years working
specifically with children and
families
and trying to help them
recover
after
traumatic incidents
within 2 and treatment foster
care and then in the hospital my
job is to help families
be successful in
making sure that their children have
the appropriate care and
resources they need
in order to thrive in the
community so I've
enjoyed that work and I've
gotten to be on the
board since for several
years and has been a true
honor of money to be able to do
that my work is been
primarily focused in the
micro level person to
person so to be able to
do macro level social work
and work extensively with
communities and work on
child prevention trial
diffuse neglect has
been absolutely a passion of
mine throughout my career and
it's been an honor to be able to do
that.
Thank you and next will have
Tracy.
Good afternoon madam
chair to hang
and vice chair
Hermio my name is Tracy
Nath I am from San
Juan County having
retired from San Juan
County after 26
years of serving as a
juvenile services administrator
I ran the juvenile
detention center crisis
shelter and residential
treatment center and
also who was involved
in many
innovative
programs for
disadvantaged youth
in our community and in our
states I A. provide
it's an honor to
be appointed to
the children's trust fund to
continue the
work of
helping youth that
have been in foster care
who have been experiencing
abuse neglect and try
to seek ways in
communities whether they're small
or large communities
to
assist families
in need and so as
part of
the.
Children's trust fund I look forward
to continuing that work
and
I appreciate your
at the opportunity
to be here today and to speak
to you thank
you.
Thank you our next we have state
seeking good
afternoon madam chair
and vice chair
thank you for having me here
I am looking forward to
serving on the children's
trust fund board again
I used to drive my grandma
into the meetings when she
was on the board
back in 2008.
And 7 and
I look forward
to.
Dissipating in helping out
children in New Mexico.
Thank you to the 4 of you what did
anybody come with you in
support of the your
confirmation.
The without I'm gonna go to the
committee for questions
so Mr chair
and madam chair they
all came prepared
with their handouts on the
children's trust fund board so
I think you'll be hearing a lot
about it very
good. So I'm
gonna go to questions of the
committee starting with senator Ortiz
the people.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
senator the fed ex
for for bringing these
candidates for confirmation
before us
we had a presentation.
Last week at the
health and Human Services
Committee. Of
your of your
proposal
and my comment at that
time was.
I couldn't supported because
it's not asking for enough you need to
ask for
more.
This is the year where we have
quite a bit of extra money in the
state extra money being
money.
Of the magnitude we've never
imagined in the past
so I might urge is
for you to ask for at least
a mystery us
10.
10000000.
Go big.
A bit because
what you get to spend is only the
into the 3 year rolling
average of the interest
and so you know
it let's say you
get an extra
10
that'll add.
Maybe
400000 a year
to which you could spend.
And that's great
but the needs you know are
so much beyond that so
I would say.
Because you know you
first I want to guess the legislature
we're not going to add more to it so if you
just pretend you may get
a I ever
1.3 year
with. But if
you ask for 20 you might get
10. So
that would be my my my
urging for
you.
Then.
The division between
Mr chairman and and
and countries
the.
The next generation fund
could somebody talk about that
because that
was
Senator.
Cynthia novice
addition to the children's
trust fund
and I remember when
it was first brought up in the this is a
great idea but I
haven't heard much about
it so what's happening with the
children's trust I mean with
the. Next
generation
fund.
Thank you at
chairman do you have any advice
or had a meal and and senator
Ortiz Y. Pino for your question I
appreciate that yes we're
very proud of the next the next
generation funded primarily
focuses on serving
youth and
encouraging positive youth
development so we
primarily try to
fund programs specifically
that look at the older
population to
encourage positive youth
development
I can say that I joined
the bore when I joined
the board back into
a few years ago we
were.
We were aboard a 4
and that was a previous administration
and we had no next and
council even though have been
unveiled. We
have worked diligently
and our board through
the support of the governor
and the Senate in
reestablishing our
board back in
2019
giving us resources
of the person have
been able to re establish the
next generation fund which
we are extremely proud of
our council
was.
Referred to us we had
other board members who
recruited
council members
to be on our council all
of the members who
supplied were
reviewed by the children's trust
fund and then we appoint
them to the council to serve
on the council they
overview RF peas
and currently they're doing
are a phase so they have a
smaller amount of
money they also have
no funding
stream so the
children's trust fund has a
funding stream through our license
plates answer
marriage license but
the a new next generation
Fund exist solely on
interest from
there indictment
so they have a very
small amount
of money that they're able to give
away every year so for
that reason they have to
do RFA's now
when the next generation council came
back into existence again
with the great work of the
Senate
and through the children's trust
fund there was a fair
amount of funding that had been
able to sit there and grow over
time so in
2020 and
2020.they
were able to make several
large
requests but now
unfortunately this year they
are only able to do up
to $120000 and twenty thousand
dollars and we're only able to find
a couple of programs and
that's because they live off the
interest of their indictment
only 1 of our
long term goals
within children's trust fund is
to ultimately
develop with the help of the
Senate and the legislature
of funding stream for the next
generation fund similar
to something that we have with children's
trust fund not quite sure
what that'll be we have ideas
brewing and we hope to
present that in future
sessions.
Mr Chairman then
a couple of questions for you following
that up.
First if you could explain the
RFA is and how it differs
from an RP yes
my apologies
madam chair and vice chair and senator
to subpoena and
RFA is a request
for author
it's.
It's a one year contract
of $60000 or
less whereas in
R. S. P. that we do
a request for proposal
within the children's trust fund
is a multi year grants
of 4 years
so the children's trust fund
grants allow
allow programs
to grow and develop over
a 4 year period so that
after the 4 years when our funding
has ended they can hopefully
be self sustaining and
continue on with the work that
the children's trust fund has helped them
to create RFA's
are much smaller that like I said
there $60000
Max and there only
for a year so
it doesn't allow
programs the same
opportunity to continue
to grow next
generation I would like
to alternately develop into our
of peas if they can
have taken the funding in order
to keep on going
continuous funding in order to do
that and then Mr chairman my
second question is
I didn't
understand
what was created that the next
generation fund I thought you
were the the the
the
the.
The trustees for both funds
but that's not the case of a
separate next
generation funds set of
trustees yes
Sir act
and
chair.
There is very friendly
yes the children's trust
fund does
a point the members
of the next generation
Council and
whenever they they have
their own separate meetings they have their
own separate chair and
actually
Representative tad ahead of
you was the previous
chair of the next generation
council before she was
elected to step
down after that course
so she has quite a bit of
familiarity with the next generation
counseling the amount of work that they
have done and they've done some
amazing things with
very limited resources
well Mr chairman thank
you.
The idea originally
behind the children's trust fund
projects would be
that they would try
innovations that
could then be adopted
statewide and
and at some point I would
love to have the.
The report the
report from the
members of the children's trust
fund board at
to the Legislative Health and Human
Services Committee
of what are the things
that that really are working
so well that we need to go statewide
with the that would be really
valuable information for us but
we can do that next
interim.
Some so be planning what you're gonna
tell us thank you Mr
chairman thank you chairman
Duhigg.
Thank you Mr chair
and I I want the
echo Senator Ortiz
Pinos on comments
about ask for
more.
For a you know.
Having only
$120000
to to do things with
that's not that
when we are last in
child well being in the
nation.
So I hope
you guys will we'll
have a big bold ask
our and
I and I and I'm sure many
of my colleagues would be happy to
to do whatever we can to support
that.
I I just wonder because you
guys really have
a broad
swath of
experience
across child
well being issues as I'm gonna
ask this question and I'm
gonna ask you to kind of think about it I'm
gonna ask some other questions
but I'd really
like to know from your perspective
what you think the
legislature
what kind of
laws we could be adopting
that would make a significant
difference
and a lot of that the issues
that we're facing and I don't know if
there's any that have been proposed
in the past that you
think would be particularly helpful or
just ideas that you have
I know that's kind of a big question
so I just thinking about
that. I also
want to ask.
So I'm I'm looking there's
there's 13 members
of this committee over
all do we
know are there
actually 13 people sitting on the
committee.
Right now Hey
if I make sure we do
have we actually do have one open
seat with the current
potential of another open
seat possible
but I need to check with missiles are
about that.
Right thank you
so if you know anyone would
be wonderful
on this board and potentially
have financial experience
we would really appreciate
it hopefully someone
like that is is watching and
listening
I also see in our kind of book of
these boards it
says.
The that
CYFD promulgates
rules that are approved
by you so
do you all approve
all rulemaking that CYFD
dollars.
My misunderstanding
that.
At that check to robin do you
have a and no
we do not we do
not have any authority over
CYFD we do have
authority within our board and
we put together
our.
Rules within our board
and that it's keeping me
what's the by laws we
put together our own bylaws
within the board and CYFD
does provide us with administrative
support.
I will just add to that
chairwoman
given the
transitions within
CYFD
there
we we
would like more
support from CYFD
in terms of not only
the administrative
side of the commission
but also
this support in
gaining awareness of the work that
we do in the programs that we
fund that
was something that we previously
had spoken
with.
Former Chief Justice
property help
and
former cabinets
as cabinet
secretary Beth Gillian
who's now at
the office of Family representation
and advocacy
and so it's really
important to the the
board over all that we re
establish a relationship with
CYFD
and the
assistance
and support for that would
be significant for
us.
Thank you it's now
hopefully.
Secretary of Saddam's
is here in that message as
well.
Because there's something else was going to ask
you and now I just let my
mind so I
guess all until I can
remember when you want to go back
to your first question yeah let's let's
let's go back to the
so shin
a you didn't get to talk very much
in terms of your introduction
you want to respond to your first question
I'm sure I'll just I didn't mention
anything about my professional
career but hi my
careers in the
earlier phases but I am
at family and children's live
tourney and
I practice with
Cuddy and McCarthy had of
Santa Fe and
then I also take
contract
for cases working
on behalf of children and
respondents
and
really made my
interest in family and children's
law particularly in New
Mexico
started in my first job
out of college which
I worked for court appointed special
advocates
and I
came home one day from
the first day I think of that
job and I
called my parents
and I said I
didn't know
that. You
could grow up without 2 parents
and that is such a privilege to
be able to say
that and
of it really
ignited a
desire to
work with children and families
in New Mexico I went
to UNM law with the
sole purpose of
doing this work
and was
granted the first ever F. Michael
Hart advocacy
for children and families
scholarship and
so this has been
deeply embedded in
me for many years and it's a
privilege to be able to practice
law in New Mexico
and work with children and
families on both
one end of the spectrum and the other
in private practice
and now working on more abuse
neglect cases which
takes me sort of full circle
from my class a days
so I just wanted to add
that you know being able to
see
the issues that face children
and families every day
in the state
and mostly that are
conciliate 2
poverty is
such
a compelling
it's compelling work to do and
it ties in very
nicely with the children's trust
fund because we are
you know our goal is to fund
programs that aren't necessarily
the most popular or
even in the
bigger more populated
regions of the state and
so this
is somewhat related to your question
about law and policy in the
state but it's being
able to fund programs
that really are at
the grassroots level
and doing work in local
communities with
Stena in tandem with
schools and
after care providers
and all of these people
that create the village that children
and families who are facing these
issues they desperately
need those
resources.
I would just like to say with
my.
Long years of experience
in juvenile justice I saw the
worst of the worst for 26
years and see
children grow up in
facilities
institutions
and just not having any
parents and
the years that I
managed to
work with CYFD and
with
juvenile justice
I was unaware
of the children's trust fund which
is really crazy
to think that I did
not know children's trust
fund did not exit did
existed
and there is one thing
that matters and that
it's community
based services
and when a
community has
services in their own
area to provide
for their own
use they
will be more successful
and knowing that the children's
trust fund can
provide those services
and fund those services in
local communities is
huge and so
for me having
the knowledge that children's
trust trust fund can
provide that funding and
you as
a
legislature can support
that means a
lot and so
I.
Send off with the
fact that even though I didn't
know about it I do
now and it's important
that we continue to support
it so thank
you.
Good question.
What losses.
Yeah.
On this thing
so to address about
line policy here
you know in addition to community
based funding and how
transformative that can be
in children and youths
older youth youths
lives I think is
really cannot be overstated
the other piece I think from
a legal perspective that I
see
is.
You know the need
for
I see this a lot in my practice
that the
emotional and
practical
needs of families
is not typically in
alignment with the
law
and the child and
family welfare system
needs to evolve
I do believe that the office
of Family representation and
advocacy provides a more
holistic option
for families and
providing
the only attorneys for everyone
involved including
respondents who want
to you know this is
the first opportunity in
many from my perspective
many of these families lives
were there
actually be
able to utilize services
that they don't normally have
access to
and whether that
be
you know outpatient
alcohol or substance
abuse
treatment psycho
social services behavioral
health assessments
and.
The and
and really an interdisciplinary
approach to
especially when families come into
of the system
and how
critical it is
for.
The state to recognize
that it's much
like our general health care
system preventive care
is ultimately
going I believe to pay
off and
being able to have
social workers and
therapists and a family
a neutral
family
Representative which is
something that was proposed
under for but hasn't been
funded
is critical because that
person can go to
CYFD and can
go to other
providers and save
and and and
to you know the
children's court attorneys
and
and.
Judges and say
this family really
can go this way or this
way and this is the
difference of
what we can
find.
So I would really like to
see
professionally in on
behalf of this
board a more
into interdisciplinary
approach to family work
and to promoting
children's welfare
and
it just it.
You know practical
solutions like a gas
card
lower
subsidized daycare
for no that's changed
more recently but
so that someone can go to work and
start to support their family
and even having
a cell phone I mean the state
in age is hard to imagine
that having
something at your finger
tips where you get work done
and are able to communicate with
people but I see a
lot of
people
in in state custody
cases where even
getting a hold of them to apprise them
of their rights doesn't exist
and that's
really
problematic.
Thank you that's that's really helpful
this site
you.
Response thank
you that madam
chair
my position that I
would take that I would like
the legislature to take a serious look
at is the children's
code children's
code as it exists today
is so
antiquated and
state through
the years have.
Maybe efforts to
revise it to
get committees together
to make
changes to modify
and no matter
what happens there are
still going to be
youth in the juvenile justice
system even if
facilities closed across the
state there's only
3 there's
still.
Kids and they're still
managing to be
transported all over the
community
to certain facilities
and so I would I
would love to see children's
code.
Be a higher
priority for
our state because
of the fact that I believe we're
still slobbering
off of 2008
and is that spent a
long time ago so
that would be my response
to your question.
Thank you
NF.
Yes have you comment to if
you don't you don't you don't have to
but totally up to
you.
At. Read
us sin thank
you Carol for the night
I'm social worker not a
judge.
Because I apologize
yes I did bring to bring
this handout for the senators to
review excellent thank you
very much and and yet not now you've
gotten a
promotion.
That's all I have Mister chair
thank you Senator
Lopez.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
to each of you for your
continued service and you
service with regards
to the state and I
just want to say thank you for
the conversation that we're
having Mr chair
madam chair
members.
He you just
mentioned from office a
family representation
and we just passed
that legislation a couple of years
ago I wanted to be a
commissioner on the board
and what you
explain as exactly what
needs to happen right
for our children and I know
that that the trust fund
that's the intent behind
it.
But we haven't funded
it and we were in
front of health and Human Services
last week
we were short changed
so in order to really do the job
that our intent is as was
explained we need
more money. Because
right now we're operating without
a
facility.
Staff is working from
home. We're
only table to offer
I mean we're just making the transition
for guarding at light Ms
right that is all we're
doing from office
and administrative office of the
courts to our entity
and we're not
we we just don't have an opportunity
to even continue to
organize we were short
changed over coming back the session
for for the funding that we
need.
And in response to what you're
saying about the children's code
I've been able finally to put money
in through the during your
bill
for the for the
courts the Supreme Court
to actually organize
and there we started
on the process of re
visiting after
many years again the
children's comment right now
it's in the I call it a
stall
because there were some concerns
raised as to how deep
dive the group is going to
go so I think
it's going to be revised
what our plan is and
probably begin
maybe later this year it's a 2 year
process for us to go
through but it also
affects the work that each of you were
doing on with the children's
trust fund it affects
our juvenile justice
system our foster
care system and the list is
long.
Thank you to each use good to see
some of you back again
to
and to have it we're here
to help in any way that we can
also we're all in this
together and also
for miss king is always good to see
you back to
in I know that you
have a wealth of experience to
give
also.
And how would receive
your for what your your grandmother
did in
in moving this
forward is phenomenal
Division just like she did with
CYFD we just kind of have
to I called
madam chair that kind of street
and the writer a little bit
thank you.
Thank you senator Ortiz Y.
Pino. Thank
you Mr chairman I just wanted to
to comment about
each of the suggestions that
you made for things that could be
done during her testimony
last week to our
Health Human Services
Committee at secretary
acting secretary because of
those.
Among the things that they're planning
and and and she would like to see
done is the creation
of a children a family services
division. And I
think that would do go a long
way to doing precisely what
you're you're talking about
it's always struck
us is that the
unfair that
will remove children from a
family.
That is not
able to care for them simply because
of their poverty placement
of foster home and give the foster
family a lot more money
it is a fraction
of that money had been given to
their. The
family that we remove them from
they might not have had to have been
removed and
so
just the simple things like
that and it all boils down
to I
think.
The department is allowed
itself to get into a
policeman role.
In which
enforcing
abuse and neglect is
all they do
instead of supporting
families which was the whole
point of the creation
L. as king's vision
and and the
support for families
becomes much more difficult if
you trying to get it.
Through the person that has the authority
to take your kid away
so having 2
separate divisions I think
will make explicit
the fact that
a lot of cases don't need to
have. Of
somebody with the power to take
the kid right responding
we can get help to them
much more easily the
other thing about that is
the. And
AJ
the that this Senator
souls talked about so much
is doing so much in several counties
in the state already in
Los crucis they're proposing
family resource
center.
And that's a model that
I know Bernalillo county's talking
about San Miguel County
is talking a lot of other counties are
talking about that would be
the place where they could
go for the.
The cellphone or the
car repair or whatever
it takes to hold the family
together in the in
with some simple expenditure
of direct funding
you know that that would make
it so much less
dramatic for the kids so
thank you for your the other one
is the revision of the children's code
I and I'm glad Senator Lopez
is already taken some steps in
that it's a
huge undertaking
the big issue in my mind
is how we deal with the
confidentiality issue
which unfortunately has become
the the cloak
for HSD
mismanagement Agency
failures instead
of. Protecting
the kids were protecting
the department and its personnel
and I think that you
know.
There are so many ways in which we could
protect each other states have dealt
with it and found ways to do
this did
not.
Released kids names to the
newspaper for example
but this still make it
available.
To the policy
makers in the funders in
the and the public when
the HSD screws up in the
Department screws up they should be
able to hide behind it so
that's that's one of the key
things but I know there's plenty
other issues in the
children's co the need revision
thank you both for your ideas
thank you madam chair.
Thank you know I don't have any questions I
just want to comment and say thank
you so much and the comment
was made about community based
services and a
somebody who represent rural New
Mexico it's
vital that community based
services are in place to
help children in
need and so when
children can talk to people who
are reflective of their community
we see that that makes a tremendous
impact and so I'm thankful that you
brought that up in that you talk about
that I just want to thank you
for being there on behalf of the children
of New Mexico and for all
that you need to advocate for them
and for the betterment of them and
their future and with that
what is the will of the committee.

Yes thank you so much Mister
chair I just wanted to share
a little bit about what the children's
trust fund is been doing because I'm
just so proud of the
work that we have accomplished
with the full board I just wanted to
share with you guys we
now have our own website
that standalone from CYFD
but what I really want you guys to know
is while we are asking
for more funding we are
actively working with
trying to create more funding
within the funding streams of the legislature
has given us through our
license plate and
while we can't really encourage marriage
but we do
support.
But I wanted to share which to
me is doing with working
with the motor vehicles
that the dealers associations
we're going to try to
really increase and ramp up
our sales of our license plates
we have been working closely
with the MVD who it's been
incredibly responsive
I'm getting us now where you could
access by your license plate
on the website you can no
longer have to send in the affirmative
check because who does
so you can pay
online we have been
actively working
with trying to make sure the
legislature's aware of us
again when I started it was
4 of 4 to
see the transformation we have
gone through and the work that I
believe we can do to help
bring innovation to New
Mexico is incredibly
exciting we really hope to
bring back prevent child abuse
America to New
Mexico through the children's trust
fund it was with us for
awhile and we are
actively working on that
we really do want to bring back
innovation we want to bring
back Education
to smaller agencies
on how to apply for R. F.
peas we have ideas
on how to encourage the because we
have the big wonderful
agencies that do amazing
work but then has
miss Smith noted communities
are so important and
being able to provide the
service that's important that
that community is absolutely
critical we are
hoping to cook
collaborate closely with
ECECD
we have meetings with them we're
hoping secretary to order us
will be with us we haven't had an
opportunity yet to get on her
schedule but we are
actively working on that as
well we are trying
to use every resource
that the legislature has given
us and we hope that
you will continue to support us and
see the work that we're doing
and know that we are
trying our best to bring
forth innovation into the
state to really creates my new
ideas and have people think
about it doesn't have to be a brand new
idea for the
world it can be new for New
Mexico it can be new for
Sandoval County
right it can be something that
worked in Colorado it
can be something that worked in
Farmington and move it
in there it doesn't have. To be
huge so I really
appreciate I can't
express enough how grateful I am
that you guys have given us a
board that has the
ability to bring forth these
ideas and we really do
hope CYFD will continue

Mr chair members of the committee
thank you for the
opportunity.
To be here today I
apologize in advance I'm working
on a couple of hours of
sleep in reference to the call we had
last night so
please bear with me I'm
really excited to be here in just have
this opportunity to be
considered
today
like
chairwoman said I
am
born and raised in Albuquerque New
Mexico I've lived here my entire
life I went
to college on an athletic scholarship
and Oklahoma and Georgia and
came back and immediately joined the police
academy my
grandfather was a police
officer
I think I followed in his footsteps
a little bit I
absolutely love what I
do
I I love serving the
community and I've worked really closely
with
community members and
stakeholders throughout
my career I know that
was shared with you as
far as where I have served but
I've also been on several
different commissions as far
as the more sexual
assault and and domestic
violence commission the fast
unit that was references the
family abuse and stalking training
team
I've also worked multiplied
multi disciplinary team
with us CYFD in
Bernalillo county
and I again just
appreciate your consideration
today.
Thank you so much for joining us
and so I'm gonna go to questions
or comments from the
committee Senator
panics. Thank
you Mr chair and thank you for
stepping forward for this
what is it that you expect
to accomplish on this
commission. Mr
chair and
Center Senator
Stefanics I hope I
pronounce your name
correctly.
My intent is to
serve as a member
of the committee
and be fair
and unbiased of when
reviewing any disciplinary
action or
termination for state police officer
and also provide
my experience
in reference to any policies
or considerations with the state
police department.
So Mr chair
when we were hearing
from member
from the.
Because unemployment
compensation board
this morning the
question was asked whether or
not. They
ever met with the person
individually personally
and they said no they only
referred to the paper
record sure they
it was a factual
factually based what is
your
ideas about
that.
Mr chair members of the
committee.
I think it's important to be able
to review on
any administrative paperwork I
do think it also
is important to see and hear the
perspective of an
officer
I'm a relating that a little bit to my
experience of
investigating officer
involved shootings as a supervisor
and hearing that perspective
but I also recognize
that just seen what is written on
paper as the facts
of the case.
Thank you very much thank you Mr
chairman.
Thank you senator any other
questions.
Senator Ortiz Y.
Pino.
Thank you Mr chairman thank
you for
being willing to to to
do this extra on top of
everything else that you do.
So is it these are these are
state police disciplinary
hearings those the ones that you're
doing or or they they extend
beyond the state police department
Mr chairman members of the committee
my understanding it is a
state DPS just the
state yes Sir
and and
does that put you in a
in a it does that
create a conflict for you in
anyway Mr chair
members of the committee in
my opinion it does not
potentially can it yes
but I stand true to
who I am I think people
who know me know that
I am fair I hold my integrity
very high and I
will never jeopardize that
and I think that's known to
those that I work with.
Excellent one final
question Mr chairman
intensely personal
question.
What was the sport you got your
athletic
scholarship.
Mr chair members of the committee it
was in softball so
yes discipline
I don't I coached when I
came back from
college I absolutely
loved it and the job has
taken over that part of my
life right
thank you for for being willing to
serve think
our.
Senator
Lopez.
Thank you Mr
chair and I
want to say thank you for your willingness
to give more of
your time I just
happened to notice on your resume
of your time
experience
contributions and working
around CYFD
on all the different issues for
the abuse and neglect and
everything else is on the list
so I
just want to say thank you
you. Mr
chair is you know everything
in our committee just in the last few
minutes has been centering
talking about children
but I know that in your
role in the position that you
hold you see there the
ugly so I just
wanted to say thank you thank you
thank you Mr chair.
Thank you so much any other questions
from the committee.
Seeing no other questions what is the
will of the
committee.
Miss Mister chairman I move
the the committee
confirm
chief says
Cecil here seasonally
Senator officially Barker
as a as a member of the
public safety advisory
commission
okay I'll second
with the second from Senator
CENIC's anyone in
opposition of the
country.
Seeing no objection there's
I
excused
6 in favor
you made it past the committee and
you will then be presented to the
full Senate thank you so much
for all that you do thank you for your
time.
Mr chair I
don't think that we have
any of the the
next folks other than the
folks who are here for the gaming control
board I know that Senator
Padilla really wanted to be
here to
to sponsor his constituent
and I believe he's going to be here within
the next 15
minutes
so I think if folks
don't.
The.
Doesn't look like it to
me.
Over maybe do
we want to check in
hall.
So I have a
question chair
Mister chair
what is the policy of
confirming individuals
who cannot appear.
It they're out of state
there's a death in the family
doesn't get postponed
we reschedule.
Yes the thing Senator
us so like there were a
number of folks who are originally
on this
agenda who just
weren't able for one reason or
another to to be here today
so they'll just
bill get postponed will
we'll do them in November or
or during the
session
and we it was just
gonna be too complicated to set
up the ability for folks to
appear remotely here
today
and so I know there was one person who
asked if they could appear remotely
because they were gonna be able to get into
town I
and we said no and so what will
we'll hear them in November
okay thank you
for.
Was there anyone in the
holy.
Well I think if if folks
don't mind let's let's
give Senator Padilla 10
minutes to to get here he said
he'd be here in about
230
but will be in recess
until first first
couple of minutes we will
take a short recess and will
reconvene when Senator Padilla
does enter
the committee wrote thank you nope.
