The Senate 80 Enro Cultural
Affairs Committee will come to order.
We will begin here
on our agenda. We have some
carryover from
Senate uh the
Tuesday
Senate Bill 41 Senate Bill
276
Senate Bill 308.
And then we'll see if we can get
to Senate Bill 379
Senate Bill 409 and
SJM two.
You need to
get
>> thank you, madam Chair. Good
morning
and good
morning,
>> Senator Pinto
Senators.
Your record of attendance.
Senator Mais,
Senator Sanchez,
Senators,
Senator Souls,
Senator
Pinto.
There is a quorum.
So
sure
>> and you May be getting
>> thank you madam Chair and
good morning, esteemed colleagues.
This morning we bring before you
Senate Bill 41 which
mandates the creation of the
turquoise alert
system.
Um This is
the creation
of the turquoise alert system is
dedicated to the rapid dissemination
of information regarding
missing American Indian
individuals in our
State. Our beautiful
State is home to a rich tapestry
of indigenous cultures. Yet
tragically, our native
communities face disproportionate
rates of missing persons
cases. In
fact, our State is actually
home to the most
mm IP cases
in the country.
This crisis has left families
and communities in anguish,
often feeling invisible
and unsupported
Senate. Bill 41 seeks
to address this pressing issue
by establishing an alert
system ensuring
timely and effective
communication.
When an American Indian person
goes missing,
modeled after
our existing alert systems
like the Amber and Silver
alerts, the Turco
alert will serve as a
specialized tool,
facilitating swift
collaboration
between law enforcement
agencies, media outlets
and the public
by broadcasting critical
information urgently,
we can enhance the likelihood
of locating missing
individuals and reuniting
them with their loved ones.
And if I May on a personal
note for years, I have
advocated for and
alongside those
most impacted by this
crisis. I carry
with me countless
stories about
our system has
failed to respond to
the disappearance or murder
when a native person goes
missing right here in our
State.
Through this advocacy, I've come
to know that this tragedy
is not just one
loss,
madam Chair and Senators. I've
come to understand that this
tragedy means a person
goes missing three times
once in person
next in the system.
And then finally again, in the
media,
what we have before us is an
opportunity to address
an historic
injustice, systemic
disparities and sow
seeds of healing for people
who are hurting.
And so this morning, we urge you to
support Senate
Bill 41 and
join us in establishing
the turquoise alert system,
a vital solution to aid
in this crisis. I'm
going to hand it over to
my cosponsor representative
Anaya.
>> Yes. A Bena. Thank you,
Senator. Uh my
name is Michelle Paulinea Beta
and I represent house district
69 in the State of New Mexico,
a very large and rural
district. And I come to you
today as a cosponsor for the
turquoise alert bill
as a daughter of an
indigenous woman who was
abducted.
>> Yeah, I don't
think you introduced yourself for the
>> record
madam Chair Members of the Committee. My
name is Senator Angel
Charlie.
>> Thank you. Uh Again,
I'm coming to you as the daughter
of an indigenous woman who
was abducted in the early
nineties and
taken to
a remote area and
beaten and left to
die. Um Unfortunately,
she was found um
a few days later and was
rescued and we brought her
home. Um I'm
also representative
of a veteran, a Vietnam veteran
who came yesterday to our
house Chamber to be honored
and recognized and
unfortunately had to leave right
away because he said his
brother was missing,
had been missing for a few days
and they were not able to locate
him and it did not sit
well that he could be here and fully
celebrate and embrace the day
because him and his family were
mobilized to look for
his brother. These
are the everyday stories.
It's too close to home
and the reason why
we need this type of alert
system, especially in rural
areas and tribal communities
where we do not have the infrastructure
or public safety
to get alerts out
or to even get search parties
out to look for our indigenous
relatives. Thank
you
>> and madam Chair. We we also
have an expert witness Secretary
Monet from Indian
Affairs
>> madam Chair Members of the
Committee, Buju
Ani Tansi. I'm
Joe Zman. I serve as the Cabinet
Secretary for the Indian Affairs Department
for the State of New Mexico.
Thank you for having us today.
Um As as
the legislators have mentioned,
we are here on behalf of SB
41 to ensure
that we have a turquoise alert
um that will help us
to get out the
notification of a missing
indigenous person as quickly as
possible. So
I have a
presentation
and I won't go through all
of it or I won't read it line
by line. Um But I do
want to just kind of go through. So
moving on to page
number two
tells a little bit
about what
we um
what the bill is about, what the
alert is. So
establishing as
was mentioned, establishing the turquoise
alert for missing persons
uh similar to the other missing
persons act in in
New Mexico and
ensuring that we'll have this
notification system for
uh indigenous people.
This step is designed to
improve the chances
of locating missing
American Indians by quickly spreading
information across multiple
platforms.
Moving on to slide number
three. Uh it
matters because we know
that we have to have a
timely response
and that a timely response
helps us to locate
more efficiently and
quickly. On average,
there are about 200
missing Native Americans across
the State of New Mexico at
any given time. And we
have the highest rates of MM
IP are between the ages
of 3039 and
4049. And
there are often more men,
native men missing than
native women.
Moving on to page
number
four.
Um, In
2022
uh we also released
the State response
plan for MM
IP. Part of
one of the calls in the State
response plan as there
are six objectives and
under uh
objectives five and six.
It talks about
having and ensuring that
law is trained
on these missing persons alerts
and Amber's alerts. But this alert,
the turquoise alert would ensure
that law enforcement is aware
and that they also have a system
in particular for missing native
people and then
also enacts part of
objective six which is
tracking for MM
IP.
Moving on to the last slide.
You'll see that there are other
states that have
similar Legislation
already. Um
We have California, Colorado
and Washington. And at the bottom,
there's just a quick little note
that talks about in a
report in
Washington's, their missing
indigenous persons alert was
activated uh
94 times
in 20 in its 1st
21 months.
And of those
94 times 80 people
were located, but 11 of
those times were uh
from the assistance
came from using the alert
system for mm IP.
So Chima, which uh
madam Chair Members of the Committee
for hearing our bill today and we look
forward to further
discussion
>> out to the um those in
the Committee room. Do we have
a show of hands of those in
support
and those in
opposition
if you would like to speak in support,
please come up to the
mic.
>> Good morning madam, Chair
Members of the Committee. My name is
Gina Morales with JD Bullington
government relations
and we represent the Pueblo
of Laguna and the
Pueblo of Laguna supports
Senator Bill 41.
And we also wanted to say
thank you to the sponsors for this
Legislation. Thank
you.
>> Good morning Committee Chair
and Committee Members. My name is
Bernadette Hardy. Um I've
never shared a lot of my
>> story but I
always lived in Albuquerque.
My grandma was taken from me
before I was
bored.
She was famous Pueblo and
I'm lucky to share her
name
which was kidnapper.
This is not normal for have
to have this much loss in our
communities. I
see this because I also lost.
My Aunt Lucille
was also Ham
and my aunt Juanita.
I lost three
murdered
women,
strong, strong women in my
family.
Two, I didn't get to meet
but one of them I did. My aunt
Juanita.
She was so
beautiful and her heart was so
big.
We might not mean much
to people but they were
everything to
me
to, to us. I worked
my life in public health
and I see this
as a public health emergency.
Something needs to happen, something
needs to change.
We need to bring justice
to our people.
Thank you for
listening.
>> Good morning madam, Chair and
Members of the Committee.
My name is Emily Pepin,
registered lobbyist with the
State of New Mexico. And here
representing the New Mexico
Coalition of sexual assault
service providers.
The coalition supports this bill
because a disproportionate number
of indigenous New Mexicans
go missing every year.
We support this bill because
it would increase the collaboration
of public safety services
across the State and
help the coalition do its critical
work of providing services
to Children and families
impacted by sexual
assault. New
Mexico cannot allow the
crisis of missing and
murdered indigenous people to
continue in our State.
Madam Chair and Members of the
Committee, I urge you to pass
this bill. Its
service is vital and will save the
lives of indigenous people
across NM. Thank
you.
>> Good morning madam Chair
and Members of the Committee.
My name is Anna Hanson.
I am the registered lobbyist
for the Pueblo of Pawa
and they stand in full
support of this
Pueblo. Opo has
a Wellness Center and
Behavior Health
Center, which is incredibly
important to the community
and they serve the entire
northern Santa Fe
County area uh
which can help
with this issue.
So please give this
bill a due pass.
Thank
you.
>> Good morning madam, Chair Members of the Committee.
My name is Conroy Chino and I
represent the Pos of
Taos and Akima
and we stand in full support.
Um No, there
are strong and compelling reasons
for the need to create a
expanded alert
system locating
missing native Americans. I think the
statistics as
has been shown to the Committee bear that
out. You know, families
living in rural communities
are almost always at a loss when
there's a missing family
member and they often always
turn to law enforcement
for help
having an
expanded uh
set of
multileveled
outlets like radio
television or even
um uh uh social
media will assist
greatly in locating persons
who are missing.
Uh There should not be
any disparity when it comes
to attempting
to locate a missing
person, any person indigenous
or not. Um
The effort should be the same
and we understand there's a cost that might
be attached to this. But the
urgent is, is, is, is,
I mean, the need is urgent
and locating a
missing person
uh and making sure that they're
safe, I should, I believe should
be paramount for those
reasons. Uh Madam Chair Members of the Committee,
we we ask for your full
and complete support. Thank
you
>> madam, Chair and
uh Committee Members. Good morning.
I'm Lieutenant Phil Vargas with New Mexico
State Police Overall
Department of pub Public Safety
is in support
of the concept of the bill.
Um There are
some amendments that we'd like to
work with internal affair or
internal uh I'm sorry,
Indian Affairs and um the
sponsors um to help
make this bill a successful
bill.
>> Good morning madam
Chair.
My name is Becky
Martinez.
My brother has been missing for
six years. He
went missing in
2019.
I stand here and I ask
you guys for your assistance
in this
bill.
I have many families that I
stand with that.
I also recognize
that are in pain and
also suffering with this
ordeal. It
is crucial for
our
tribes, our
communities,
we as New Mexico
should
be
the solid ground
of what
as they should do for their
people and their communities.
Unfortunately,
my brother has not been found.
We are still searching for
him
that does not bring
to the table.
Other families that have
family Members that are still missing
25 plus years.
Melissa Montoya Tiffany
Reed, their
families could not be
here.
I also know
that
because there is no alert
system, murders
and tragedy
happens. Had
we gotten to those people? They May have
not gotten murdered or
killed. So
please
please, I plead with you
as a family member,
as a member of a community.
And as
growing up in New Mexico,
I grew up in Farmington in San
Juan County. This is a
huge issue. I should
not have to search the rivers
and find hands of friends
and family Members
or skulls
and body parts
of family Members and
bury just a, just
a skull or just a
hand and then be asked
if you want to be given a death
certificate because you only
found part of your family's
body and you haven't
found the rest.
These are the issues that we deal
with as family Members. So please
hear me out and
please pass this
bill.
Thank
you,
>> madam, Chair Members of
the Committee. My name is
Milton Herrera.
Good morning. I am the
uh former Governor for the Pueblo
of Tsuki and we
are in support and
we urge your support
as well. Thank
you.
>> Good morning madam, Chair
Members of the Committee. I'm Herman
Lovato of the Technical
Support Division at the Department of
Public safety. We
urge your support
of this important
Legislation. Uh We
are working with the bill sponsor
and the Department of Indian
Affairs to
um make some
modifications so
that the bill can be more effective.
But we are Jewish support.
Thank
>> you.
Uh Good morning madam Chair,
I indi uh James
Durano. I'm the Governor of Santa Clara
Pueblo. I'm a former
retired police officer.
I, a former canine
Cadaver uh
officer.
Um I still
currently have a dog that I volunteer
my services with.
And um you know, time
is of the essence
of in
my 20 year plus
career. Uh
Fortunately,
the recoveries that I
encountered, we
were, were healing. Uh
We're, we're closer to the
families
and this is very crucial
Legislation that
we strongly
support.
I was very blessed
to testify up in
Alaska in regards
to the same issue.
Uh But the closure is,
is crucial to a lot of
these families.
They go through a lot of
stress, a
lot of worry.
Um But
supporting this bill,
enhance the abilities
of law enforcement,
enhance the abilities of the
community,
get awareness and get
the communication out
because time is the
essence.
Unfortunately, a lot of the
times it's, it's
closure, which will heal, help
heal the families, help
heal the community
and help heal our State.
This, this is a very serious
issue and I urge you
to support this bill Kunda.
Thank
you.
>> Good morning madam, Chair and Committee
Members. My name is Right, Heron and I
belong to the Pueblo Vlera.
I currently serve as the coalition
to stop violence. Its native women's
policy and communications coordinator
and we are here to urge you to vote. Yes
on Senate Bill 41 we view
this as a common sense
solution to address the
IWR crisis in New
Mexico. The system would bring
a much needed awareness to
relatives and their cases
because as we know, the crisis of
MMIW is under reported and
underrepresented in media
and general advocacy.
Families impacted by this issue
already must do so much of
the groundwork on their own. And it's not
easy, especially during
moments of high stress and
crisis, visibility
makes a world of the difference in these
moments and can make terrible
situations better. Our coalition
already does a lot of great work in Miwr
advocacy. I know this alert
system would be a valuable tool for
families, advocates and
tribes and we look
forward to supporting them
more with the system. We were
alerted by our community about this bill
and saw it as an opportunity to
employ you or legislators
to take actionable steps in
addressing Miwr
and supporting native f uh
families, communities
and our tribes here in the State.
Thank you again for your time and we are duty
vote. Yes. Thank
you.
>> Thank you. Would anybody in
opposition wish to speak
in the Committee room? No,
do we have anybody on
it?
Seven, I go
ahead and put up
there.
>> Good morning. Chair Members of
the Committee, Mi Bein
with both futures, New Mexico.
When we urge you to support
SB 41 and
thank you so much to the sponsors
for this Legislation. No
family should have to endure the nightmare
of a missing loved one while
also bearing the responsibility
of coordinating search efforts on
their own. Yet far too many
indigenous families. This
is the harsh reality.
I'm a member of the Navajo Nation
that spans three states
and New Mexico has the opportunity
to lead the way for our neighboring
states to implement critical
Legislation when a person
goes missing every second
matters. But on many
reservations, resources are
scarce communication as
difficult and jurisdictional
boundaries create devastating
delays. Families are
left scrambling trying to
contact law enforcement,
alert the media and organize
search efforts while also coping
with the emotional toll of fear
and uncertainty. It is
too much to ask of
anyone in crisis.
Many indi indigenous
lives are slipping through the cracks and
simply because there is no coordinated
way to spread the word.
The turquoise alert system would
change this. It would ensure
swift widespread communication,
cutting through bureaucratic
delays and giving families
the urgent response they deserve.
SB 41 is a
necessary step towards
justice, safety and dignity.
Passing this bill mean
would mean fewer families
left to navigate tragedy,
tragedy alone and more loved
ones brought home, urge
lawmakers to support this Legislation
and stand with indigenous communities
in ensuring that when someone goes
missing, they are seen heard
and searched for with urgency.
Thank
you.
>> Good morning, Chair Pinto and
Committee Members. Thank you for the
opportunity to comment. My
name is Anthony Sanchez. I'm the
head councilman for the P of
Zuni. I worked
a police officer and criminal
investigator for about 20
years. The public of
Zuni supports Senate Bill
41 for the following
reasons. The turquoise
alert system plays a vital
role in safeguarding our native
communities. Addressing
the high rates of missing persons
among American Indian
populations.
The p of and neighboring
communities have been profoundly
affected with many individuals
uncounted for
causing years of distress to
families and the community at
large. We know the
lack of timely communication,
hinders recovering
efforts and the
rapid dissemination of
information regarding missing
native individuals will empower
local law enforcement
to swiftly mobilize
resources and effectively
evolve the community,
thereby improving
the chances for safe
recoveries. I
urge you to pass in a bill
41 and I want to
thank you for your time. Thank
you.
>> Hello madam, Chair
Members of the Committee. My name is
Pat. I'm with the coalition to
stop violence against native women
and I'm in strong support of this
bill. The missing and murdered
indigenous persons crisis
is a genuine public health
issue that requires
whole level commitment
to holistic response and
prevention from State,
federal and tribal
agencies. Over the
past five years, I have worked
directly with impacted family
Members and I can say with
complete confidence that
every single one of them has
expressed deep concerns
with the lack of coordinated
response between jurisdictions.
The general apathy of State
and local governments to the
issue. A breakdown
of law enforcement engagement and
communication with families
and the systematic inequalities
in native communities that
contribute to the consistent
occurrence of these preventable
tragedies. This
bill is designed to help
address the issue around
jurisdictional communication and
response and if
implemented would be an open
door opportunity for tribal
and State entities to
improve their coms
infrastructure and support
greater rapid response and
community mobilization
on and off Indian
country. Tribal
PD will also be able to
directly contribute to this system
through the National Crime Information
Center, allowing for any
cases of missing native people
entered into NC IC
to automatically be notified
through the turquoise alert system.
The system will be a massive improvement
for tribal and State collaboration
and will provide a much more efficient
system for notifying folks in
New Mexico during the most
critical hours of when a person
goes missing.
Ultimately, this is just one
step in a long journey
of restoration and healing
that requires a great deal
more effort from State and federal
entities. Tribes
in native communities across the
nation experience disproportionate
levels of poverty,
substandard housing and
unequal access to employment
and health care that are deeply
connected to risk factors
associated with the MM IP
crisis. In order
for holistic prevention to be a
part of New Mexico's State
response, the State must
fund more victim centered
and trauma informed social
services related to
domestic violence, sexual
violence, trafficking and
substance use within tribal
and urban native communities
fund. The improvement of public
health and medical infrastructure,
improve access to
transportation to
avoid avoid reliance
on contentious forms of travel
like hitchhiking and
develop comprehensive social
housing programs that
actually support communities in
the long term with safe,
affordable and stable housing.
And that's just a couple
of ideas and a long list of
things that the State can do to
uplift prevention efforts
on the MM IP crisis.
Please support this bill
and support the furthering of
community health in Indian country.
Thank
you.
>> Good morning madam,
Chair and Committee Members. My
name is Victor Adrius. I am the chief
of police for the Pueblo
Goleta and I
am in
full support of
this bill. The
law enforcement respond. The immediate
initiation of missing
person investigations is
critical to gathering
information or evidence.
Um As we all know
that the Native American
communities are disproportionately
affected by issues
related to missing persons and
often face delay,
inadequate responses.
Uh The faster we can get this
information out through the turquoise
alert, the more likelihood we
have of successfully
locating a missing loved
one. I would
encourage the passage
of this bill would illustrate
to Native American
constituents that our State
legislature is prioritizing
the locating of their missing loved
ones as we all
as New Mexicans have a duty
to advocate for the improvement of
how we manage and respond
to missing person incidents. And
this bill is a step
in the right direction. Thank you for
your
time.
>> Hello, good
morning. Yeah, it's
it. My name
is Andrea Bal
and I am a
certified
um,
search and rescue
teams,
canine, search and rescue.
I'm also the President Board
of Directors
and our organization
deals directly
with families
with missing loved ones
and we are in support of
Senate Bill 41.
A lot of our, all
of our families that
we work
with are in
despair. They lose
sleep, they don't
eat and they
lose a part of themselves.
Um, with our
work, we can, we
have discovered and continued
to discover there is a
deep increased
need and improvement for
reporting
funding,
tracking,
especially response and
jurisdiction. I
think uh Senate Bill
41 is a great stepping
stone toward
improving these
areas and the
gaps that exist.
Um Thank you for allowing
me to speak today and thank
you, Committee Chair and Committee
Members
again.
>> Good morning madam, Chair and Members
of the Committee. My name
is Zephyr Hario and I'm here to
speak on behalf of Yucca.
I'm also from the Pueblos of
Isar. Sanli
Yucca is a bipoc youth
led climate and environmental
justice organization with
Members across the State.
And we urge you to support SB
41. There is a
direct link between resource
extraction and pollution
and missing and murdered indigenous
people. We know that when
new wells are being extracted, new
leases are coming in and man
camps are full and there
is an uptick in gendered violence
and missing relatives. When
violence is committed on the land,
violence is committed against
us. The
emergency notification system
that SB 41 would create
is going to help our communities better
support each other through these moments
of uncertainty and
crisis that no
family should have to go through.
Um So we at Yucca urge you to
please vote in favor of SB
41. Thank
you.
Uh Yat
Abina. Um Good morning everyone.
My name is Zaba Jim
and I am calling
um from the Navajo Nation in
the community of Tolaga.
I am serving as the project
manager for the missing
and murdered Denna relatives
Coalition. Uh
We started as a grassroots
initiative in March of
2019 and
are about to go on our third year
as a nonprofit
in the State of New Mexico.
And I want to thank the
sponsors and supporters of
Senate Bill 41.
Um This turquoise
alert bill is very crucial
in helping to address um
this ongoing crisis
of our missing
relatives. Um So
we urge
um
to and you
all to vote in favor
for Senate Bill 41.
Again, we know this will help protect
our communities and help keep
our indigenous relatives safe.
Uh When it comes to missing
persons, we know that time
is, is so crucial and
vital. Um
So these alerts hopefully will
help um
with better coordination
and communication
between all the entities
and jurisdictions from federal
State, tribal and
local. And thank
you all and thank
you for
again, your continued support.
You.
>> Thank you.
We will go to questions
from the Committee Senator
Souls. >> Thank you
madam Chair. I think
this is wonderful. We should have been doing
it already. Um
My only real questions,
there's a whole section of new
material and
all of that seems like that ought
to be something the
Department of Justice shall
promulgate rules to make this
happen. We've already got
models in the Silver Alert
and, and some of the other
ones is it really
necessary to have all of
that as part of the
bill? And part of the reason
I ask is when there's all that
that gives people
reasons to
question change, fix,
you know, making it mov'e
slower through the process,
rather than just a short
statement that the Department
of Justice shall promulgate
rules to,
to make this
happen,
>> madam, Chair Senator. So thank you
for that question. Great
question. Um
And while that
might serve
to address this issue, it's
important and we heard from so many
community Members today
that we need a commitment
in statute from the State of
New Mexico to address this
problem. Um
And, and so we're standing
firm in that we want
accountability, State of New
Mexico and our
Department of Public
Safety.
I don't know if any.
>> Thank you. I appreciate that. Thank
you, madam, Chair and
Senator. I think
that the importance of having that in
there is because we're dealing with multiple
jurisdictions of
law enforcement and having one
uniform
section in this statute
is going to be helpful for
all across the board. Thank
you.
>> And, and madam Chair. I, I don't
disagree but I think, you know, all
it keeps talking about the Department of Public
Safety Shell. I mean, they're going to
be implementing rules in all
of these areas
anyhow. And most of
them
don't look like
they're all that. They're
almost boilerplate in a lot
of ways to, to what's
already there. I just, I don't
want it to get slowed down at
all by having multiple
places where somebody might pick
apart individual pieces
of it because the Department
of Public Safety ultimately
has to set
out the actual processes
for making all of these things
work across agencies.
That's all. Thank
you,
>> Senator Soul, Senator
Cher.
>> Um
Thank you madam Chair.
So on
page five, it's where I believe
Senator Souls was.
Uh, but I have a
question
of the State
Police and Department of Public
Safety said they were working on some
amendments
and do
the amendments have to do with this
section or is there something
else or do you
know?
>> Thank you madam Chair and Senator for that
question. I'm gonna hand it over to the
Secretary,
>> madam Chair, Senator.
Some of it has to
do with some of these sections in
ensuring that we're working
with having a proper
alert system that dps is
able to effectively and
um and madam Chair,
if I May, we can turn it over
to, to dps
to talk a little bit about that
if you'd
like.
>> Ok, but so you don't know
what amendments they are
imposing or
proposing
>> madam Chair. What we
would like to do is look to make
sure that this has the best
working thing. And so we're looking
at, um,
is this
best to do this similar
to a silver alert or do we
want to look at it as a missing
person's endangered
alert and looking at that conversation,
there's just slight differences
in looking at how that,
um, alert system works to
ensure that
dps.
Um, because they have,
they've got several different facets
in dps ensuring that
dps and the State police
are able to adequately
implement the job or
the bill. And what we want to
ensure though today
is that we continue to
get this bill on the
books. So as
DPS stated, they, they
are in favor of it. This
language is the language
that mimics. I think
Senator Souls as you were talking
about. It is the language
that's in 29-15
dash 3.2. So it is
the same language that's already
in the bill, um,
for, for another alert
system for the silver alert
system. Um, and I don't, we
don't have that as part of this job part,
but, um, that's, that is in
the bill. And then we also are looking
at uh 15-3
0.1 as well as 15-3
0.2. Uh,
those are the missing persons
and the silver
alert.
>> Would, would you
like to weigh in or
just,
I don't know if you have the,
um, would
like to answer Senator
Cher's
questions.
>> Sorry madam Sheriff
Senators. Uh,
I would agree that there
are some amendments. Um,
some of them are,
um, uh,
fiscal implications.
Some of them are technical
issues, um,
about,
um,
how we go about what, what's the
most effective way
to, um,
alert the public
and, um,
get the word out and
also,
um,
um,
do it in a way, do it in a way that's
responsible um,
for everyone involved.
So,
from the State police
perspective,
>> so,
so madam Chair, I don't know
if I
it's gonna come before us
again because it's,
it,
we're the next Committee.
Um, but certainly if
the amendments show up before
Senate Tax Business
Committee, I'm ok. I don't need
to hold it up. I understand what you're
doing. I support what you're doing,
but I also know that
when it comes to statute
that it's
more than an idea.
Ok. And
so, uh,
I, I would encourage
you to work with them and
really make sure that those
amendments show up before
it gets to, uh, the
tax
Committee
because I,
just, as Senator Soul says, I'm
looking at this, I'm
going,
it sounds
like a lot
of what's going on with the Silver
Alert or whatever. And
so why do we need something else in
statute?
And one of the things
that I see is sometimes
we
inadvertently
build things that conflict
with each other and sometimes we don't
even know that until we're
well down the line, but
it May be a year before somebody goes. Oh,
wait a minute, you can't do that.
And now we have a, a
problem. So,
so that's all I'm encouraging
is that
work with them,
come up with a clean bill.
So, when you show
up next week in front of me again,
you can say it's all done and then
I'll shut up and vote.
Yes.
>> Thank you, Senator
Sheriff.
So the bill,
um, can you explain to me
exactly how the Navajo
Nation's alert system moves
through
>> madam Chair?
Yes. And I will actually
ask one of our expert witness
to talk to speak to the
Amber Alert. But I
do want to name before I hand it
over that. I've
been in
conversations with
Mr. Gary Mike
extensively and he is
in support of this
whose,
whose daughter's tragic
murder created
the
Madam Chair, I I
cannot speak on behalf of the
Navajo nation and I don't
know exactly how their system works.
However, what I can say is that we
are trying to get this implemented
for the State of New Mexico.
And we are looking at how we
continue to work with
tribal law enforcement to ensure
that we are addressing some of those
jurisdictional issues that have been
discussed today. But as
you know, and as
the Committee knows that we are from
the State side, we're only able to
do what the State can
do. Um So we
can't control what happens on the nation's
Puan tribes. But the goal
is to ensure that the State of New
Mexico is responsive
and then we continue to have those
conversations with the nations.
Puan Trbes about jurisdictional
questions. Thank
>> you
still have more questions. But uh
Senator Sanchez,
>> uh madam, Chair, Senator
and representative, once
we get this bill passed, this will make
sure that all
agencies, sheriffs, tribal
police, State police,
municipal police will
be able to send out this
alert
and do any of them. Now
have that capability
before this has
passed.
>> Thank you, madam Chair Thank you, Senator
Sanchez. Uh Yes, this
would assist with that. And right
now we do not have
a statewide alert.
Excuse me, we do not have a statewide
alert system
in
place.
>> Thank you, Senator.
So the um,
how much do you know how much
they put into the Amber alert
for the Navajo
Nation
>> madam Chair? I, I'm not aware
of that number
>> and the reason I say that is
because it was a lot of money
and it, as far as I know the
implementation of it
uh is still an
issue, especially
when we talk about uh
putting an alert out.
There was
this part of the
task force's
plan.
>> Madam Chair Members
of the Committee. I'm going to
ask Secretary
>> the response
plan.
Thank you madam Chair uh
again on
the slide on the
presentation, I believe it's slide
four, but it talks about
uh that in the
State response plan which is
available on Ie D's website.
Excuse me, it's page
um I believe it's
page four. Uh it,
yes, page four
there. It doesn't
specifically ask
for an alert system in
the State response plan.
What it does again under
objective five D is
it says calling for the State
law enforcement to ensure
that they're trained on the missing
persons and Amber alert
system. And then
objective six also
talks about including
tracking of data for
MM IP. And so
what this alert system
does is addresses
that but not only does it
require
training. It requires a
separate alert system that of course,
law enforcement would get training on to
ensure that they understand how to
respond and what
those parameters are
for a missing native
person. And then
again, it does call
for some,
some of the data to be tracked
as well. Thank you,
madam Chair.
>> I'm glad you said that
because there were
Members of the Nava Nation on
the task force.
And during that time,
the Amber alert system was
put forward and there
was money allocated, I believe
from the federal government.
So there should be an idea of
how much money he was gonna
need for an alert
system to be implemented
on the Navajo Nation,
but I've never
seen it. Um
I did put money aside
for training uh
for our law
enforcement, not
um our law enforcement off
the reservation, but
for our tribal law
enforcement. And to my
understanding too, we
also um in
collaboration with our
FBI and dps
would that they would go out
to our tribes
nations and pueblos and do
that training.
Um I can
only speak for Navajo
Nation in
which they never
opened the door for
uh training to
occur out
there. So they
were like, well now they got to come
all the way out here to do the
training.
There have been several
incidences
this year.
A yeah alone
in which um kind
of really kindred
because of the history of the task
force. Um
we still are not even
close
to, to this
issue.
Um because this
alert system
uh right now that
we're trying to trying
to bring a bill, it, it needs
an allocation for
it, it needs money for
it. Um And
when you say
training
there, I've
lost, I would
say probably three,
not just on my reservation,
but on the Hayman's reservation
too in
which there
is, I don't know,
really know what it
is um
internally
that we,
we do lose our, our
people.
And for some
reason, we don't,
it's not an emergency.
Um And even to
our own officials
that are in those
positions to
make those calls
to do to initiate
this alert,
it is not an emergency
to them. Time
is of the essence
and most of these
deaths were
hypothermia
because something
happened out there and
nobody initiated
it. And
even then the
person that's in charge
does not have the training
or does not
um
bring in the
search and rescue
does not bring in
who needs to go out
there and we still
do not have, you
can do the alert system.
I mean, I understand
doing that but who's
gonna come in?
Um Even out
on the Navajo Nation
when we have a person
go
in the water and go
missing.
Our State police are the ones
out there looking for
them, dragging
the water to get the body
out.
Um There's no
equipment. Uh
even my
nonprofit
volunteer search
and rescue people
volunteer by
their own equipment.
And I've asked Indian
Affairs Department
to help me
get equipment
for the search and
rescue
volunteers.
Just as simple
as getting
a vehicle
for a
dog.
That's air condition.
That's, that's so
the, the, the these
dogs go through training.
Um I'm just
so we're, we're, we're
blessed with some people that
really want to help us.
But there's something
here in the State
of New Mexico within
our tribes nations and
Pueblos
that's hindering us
from tackling this
issue to
the core
to get further
than this.
This is just the tip of the
iceberg. And I know
our family Members are
always,
it is
the emotion.
It, it's up and down
the cold case files,
the um
getting the death
certificates.
It, it's
um
there's still a lot of more work
that needs to be
done.
And when we say
tribal
it, it has to, it's
because of the sovereign
nations, we can't make them
do it. And
that was a hard lesson to learn
for me. Um
that you have to have everything has
to be an opt in even
for the search and rescue bill that
I'm on. It's
an opt in, I
want to do it. I
can't make them do
it.
So
I think they're,
they're,
you know, listen to DP
S
and get
the amendments in there.
But really bringing everybody
together on this particular
issue is
still um
ongoing
and, you know, it,
it's,
it's distressing still
because this is
just before
we got into Session
that these incidences
have happened.
And I do not
know, I mean, they've tried
to bring others in on this
but it's, it's nice to
talk about
but those actually do the work
and go out there. They
know they're just
not here
on top of the
pyramid, they're down
here and
every time they try to get
more,
more done,
there's always somebody above
them that still
does not
understand
the urgency
concern is when
there's an
incident.
Um
So one Gentleman
was less than a mile from his
house
two weeks, 2.5
weeks before they even actually
decide to call search
and
rescue.
And um
the Chair will entertain a
motion
>> madam Chair
because of the
amendments and so forth. I don't
want to make a due pass motion.
I want to make a without recommendation
motion. So it still moves
on, but we've made
it clear that it needs work.
So I mov'e no
wreck.
>> So we have a bullshit
for Dupas
Norek
Anita. Please call the
roll
>> roll call
on SB
41
Senator
Mazas, Senator
Sanchez,
Senators,
Senator Scholz,
Senator Pinto.
The vote is for the
for
>> in the >> madam
Chair real quick since they're both brand
new. No recommendation
means it moves to the next
Committee.
I
fort
>> it is not a due pass. It's
just >> thank
you madam Chair. Thank you Committee
Members.
Thank
you.
Just
a
>> let >> me
>> please please if people
can take conversations outside
so we can continue
do.
And Jer Pinto,
if you'd like to do sp
276 please.
>> Yes, sir. Thank
you. So
Senate Bill two Senate
276 appropriates
2 million, 2 million
from the general fund to do the
uranium mining reclamation
revolving fund. My
understanding there's no money in that
fund right now. So we're just trying
to get that started
and it will
help
to,
um, with
our new Mexico Environmental
Department and the
fir
for two personnel
within the agency,
Uranium Mine cleanup
fund, um, to
help contract some of the
work as we mov'e forward.
But I do have a, an
amendment
22 Senate bill
276.
And if, um, I'd like
to
>> a dramatic
difference in the amount of money
allocated.
>> Yes, it does.
Well, at first it was
just about the
getting the fiscal agents
in but knowing that we don't have
anybody in there and we do have a
surplus.
Let's see what we can
do with that
amount.
Would you like me
to
talk about the
amendment
and add
zero
on page, page one
line 15 and 16,
strike $2 million
and insert in lieu thereof
$100
million.
>> Ok. So, uh,
we are on the
amendment
then
or discussion. So,
discussion on the
amendment.
>> I believe we go to Senate Finance
after
this.
>> Surer
>> seven. >> Yeah.
And, and the amendment
essentially is the
bill
with things.
So
>> I mov'e to amendment
one on
Senate bill 276
and it's
0.230936
0.1.
>> Ok. Poor discussion.
And Senator
anything else on, you know
why the change from 2
million to 100
million? >> But we
do have the surplus in the budget.
So I'm, I'm not
expecting that. We'll see
that much but,
um, justify the
two and then let's see what we can
do with the the rest.
>> OK. Uh can
out to the audience on
the amendment changing
from 2 million to
100 million
of those in
support
anyone in
opposition.
OK. Anybody need
to come speak or is
that
about the change? I mean, you don't
need to, I mean, we all understand
the difference between 2 million
and
OK. Then questions from the
Committee Chair,
>> Mr. Chair, I, I
am concerned
2 million might get through
finance. 100 million
is not going to get through finance.
So is this
counterproductive to make
this
amend
>> Senator
>> Senators, uh
Mr. Chair and Members of the
Committee? It's
more due to the surplus
that we're hearing with the
budget.
>> Um
Mr. Chair and Senator, I,
I mean, we do have the
surplus being in
the industry. $2 million
might get you a silk fence
around the property.
Uh So
I'm for the amendment. We need
to clean
up.
>> Thank you. Uh Kind of my
comments is, it's
a big change. I agree
2 million doesn't get very
much remediation
done. But
similar. I think Senator Shar,
I worry whether the finance
Committee sees 100 million and
they're just gonna park it and not even
look at it or discuss it
about reducing it.
So I'm kind of
torn between
the two, you know, as
far as a start
that, you know, whether going
clear to 100 million or
whether something more
25 50
million might
be more effective at getting
started. And if that money
actually is spend in making
remediation,
that this is a one
time only come back
for additional money into the
fund as that money is
getting used.
But,
you know, I, I certainly would
support the 100 million but I
worry that it May not get any
traction just because the
large number, it might not get a
hearing as a
result
>> to Chair the sponsors
um willing to
compromise
on the
amount
>> Senator Sanchez Mr. Chair and
uh and madam
Chair, would
you be willing to compromise on
maybe
75?
>> Do I
hear?
>> And Mr. Chair, Mount Chair and
I see the same uh concerns
as uh Mr. Chair now.
Um, we don't want it
to stop
and I understand the, the
amendment with the 2 million
being in the industry will
probably get another study
done and we don't need
any studies done. We need a cleanup
done. And I,
I sit up here and I hear all
these studies and studies and
studies and they're great
to a point, but we don't
get it done and, and somebody
makes a lot of money off us,
off the State on these
studies. I think
we've done all the studies and I think
if we maybe ask
for that much, if you would
take a change to that, I think maybe
they might get it through and we
can help you
>> Senator, I have a question
and I don't know if you know the answer
and whether someone else does
the, the
Brian pit over
in Roswell, what was the
cost of fixing
that we
do? We know? Seem like
40 million. Seems like
what's in my head from
that to
remediate that?
And this certainly is as
large, if not larger problem.
That was a one
place
concern. This
is, you know, my understanding
from our discussion the other day, there
are hundreds of,
uh uranium pittances and
mines and things that need to be cleaned
up. Uh, so I think it's a
larger overall
and we need to get started
on doing those. And
so
are you
making a, a modification
or a different
amendment?
>> Uh Mr. Chair, madam Chair,
if you would entertain
a, um,
we would strike
100 million and insert
75.
>> So we withdraw Mr.
Chair, we withdraw
this amendment
and then
>> yes. And then I believe
what you're doing is, you know,
if it's your amendment,
it's a friendly amendment if you would
withdraw that and then a
friendly amendment
for 75
million.
OK. Is there any
opposition to that
amendment?
See, no opposition.
The gavels way over
there. You have an
amended bill.
Um Mostly
it looks like it's a pretty uh straight
up funding
mechanism. Uh
We do like to go out to the
audience if you wanna comment
quickly, but I think there's pretty
much unanimous agreement on the
Committee if I'm reading the
Committee properly. But
if you quickly make a few
comments is why it matters.
>> Thank you. My name is Susan
Gordon. I'm the coordinator for the
Multicultural Alliance for
safe environment, representing
groups and communities
that are impacted by the
uranium industry.
Um So I just want
to remind you that in
2022 the
legislature passed
um some Legislation that
established um
three positions in the New
Mexico Environment Department
to begin to coordinate
Uranium clean
up. Um And
that's when this fund was CRE
created. Um But
as Senator
Pinto has said it's been empty
since then,
um Since
uh those
staff people have been
in, in office, they have
completed a strategic
plan for the State of New
Mexico. They've
established the uranium
dashboard and
also as part of their coordination,
they have begun a pilot
project with
San Juan College to train
workers that would go directly
into the uranium cleanup
industry.
So authorizing
the 2 million
slash 75
million to this
fund will further the
important work that's already supported
by the legislature.
Um And New Me, New Mexico
will benefit economically
as we mov'e toward cleaning up
our abandoned uranium mines.
And I urge your support.
Thank you.
>> Thank you. Do. Did you
wanna
>> thank you, Mr., Chair
Members of the Committee. I'm
Adela Duran and I
represent three uranium
mining companies.
Now, I'd like to clarify that
my clients have
never operated in the
State. So we don't
have anything to do with
these legacy sites
that we all know have existed
for at least 50
years. And
my clients have asked me to support
the bill this morning and
they acknowledge and
appreciate and respect
Senator Pinto and
her passion that
she's had toward this effort
since she's been in office.
And quite frankly before
that, following in the footsteps
of her grandfather, since
these sites have been
in existence and a problem in our
State for so long.
And Senator Pinto was
strategic and drafting
her bill uh
to have the funds
appropriated directly to the
revolving loan fund,
there is language in that
fund that states that
any, any monies in
the fund cannot be used
for operational
expenses. So
if this bill passes at
whatever level
of funding, then
the money will all be used towards
cleanup, which is
everyone's goal.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
>> Thank
you,
>> madam, Chair, Mr.
Chair. My name is Anna Hanson.
I am a former Santa
Fe county commissioner
and um I was
also the President of the Women
of NACO, which is the National
Association of Counties.
Uh I also worked with
um supervisor
Lena Fowler from
Arizona on a
uranium bill to
clean up all of the
uranium in the
Navajo nation and
in the Uranium Belt in
New Mexico. And I
strongly support
what is happening
here with uh madam
chair's bill. I think
this is incredibly important
for all of New Mexicans. And
so thank you very much for
bringing this bill
forward.
>> Thank you, anyone else in the
room? You were not
lying.
Ok. Anything
else? Senator
Senator Sanchez >> Mr.
Chair, I'd mov'e a due pass,
>> a due pass seconded
by Senators
if you'll call the roll,
please.
>> Thank you. Senator,
Senators
vote on Senator
Bill 276
Senator Maestas,
Senator
Sanchez
Senators,
Senator
Scholz, Senator
Pinto.
>> So Senator, you have a due pass
as amended to greatly
increase the amount and we hope it
goes through
and you want to mov'e on then
to the, the next bill, the
ombudsman bill.
So Senate Bill 308
Native American Ombudsman
Act.
>> So Senate Bill three
appropriates 2 million from the
General to the Indian Affairs
Department. Um
I do believe I have an
amendment to for this
because I
putting the Butman
into the Indian Affairs
Department. It seem
like it would be a better fit to put
in the Attorney General's
Department.
So, um
and it's to establish
the office of the Native American
Ombud to identify, investigate
and resolve concerns related
to services
provided to Native
Americans.
Um The ombud will
be appointed by the Secretary
um will be appointed also
by the um attorney
General.
Sorry on that.
And we oversee office
operations, investigating
complaints. And
I know in the fir they were
saying that the
um
uh the, the
um
cost to hire and bode
spend was about under
200 or not
200,000, I think
actually, yeah, it was like 100 and
22 less than
200,000. And they were asking
what the rest of the money would be
used for. Well,
what we know is
that with our tribes nations and
Pueblo's being unique
in their own entities
too, that there might
also be necessary
contract work that might not
have to be carried out
that their own buds men might not be
capable of. So
it's kind of a
seeing where we go from
there um
is uh as we mov'e
forward, but I do
have an amendment
to Senate Bill 308.
>> Does this amendment raise it to
$75 million?
No, >> does it, it keeps,
it keeps appropriation the
same, but it does
add a declaration
of emergency to
it. Um,
and it just strikes out
in most areas, the Indian
Affairs Department and
putting the State Department of
Justice which
is on line one lines
23 and 24
and lines through 2 to
9 strike Secretary
in lieu of uh,
attorney General.
And
on page line on page two
line 10 after the
semicolon and the cert.
And
>> let's mov'e the amendment
discussion,
>> Mr. Chair Sanchez, Mr.
Chair, I'll mov'e the amendment for
discussion only
230809.2.
Thank you Senate Bill 30
eight
>> Senator. As I look through
this other than the
emergency clause, the
Majority of this is just
fixing the places to
mov'e it from Indian
Affairs to Department of
Justice and then
some of the grammatical work,
commas and colons and
things of that sort. Is that
accurate?
>> Yes, Mr. Chen.
>> Ok. And,
and then on the backside the
emergency clause.
Ok.
Um Those in the room in support
of the amendment.
Thank you. Would you want to
speak or you just, you're good.
Ok.
Um Anyone
else anyone in opposition to the
amendment?
If not then questions from the
Committee on the
amendment.
>> Mister Chair. No questions. I
would a due pass to
vote on the amendment. >> We have a motion for
a due pass on the
amendment
second. Um,
and if you'll call, is there
any opposition to do, pass on
the amendment? Let's do it the quick
way. See no
opposition. The amend
you now have an amended bill.
Senator.
So, back on to the main
bill
and here again, I
think we're out to the audience
support of Senate
bill 308.
Do you anyone like to speak
or
a due pass
motion?
>> Uh, madam Chair and
Members of the Committee, I'm
Carol Miller. Uh
We worked with this Committee
to do the rural equity
on B and I
think that this bill
is extremely
important. I'm quite
happy to have it moved
to the Department of
Justice because
of the commitment of
the attorney General to
really pres
pursue to equity
throughout the State.
Um I could see
a use for additional
funds being used
to create some kind
of online system
for people to actually
bring their comments and
issues to the
ombud. That
outreach I think is
very important
and I'm highly
supportive of the bill
and this effort. Thank
you.
>> Thank you. Is there anyone in
opposition
Nadine when I line?
No, Senator, anything
else?
Senator Shir
>> Mr. Chair ought to mov'e a due pass
motion >> for a due pass second
by Senators. If
you'll call the roll,
please
>> roll. Call Senators
on Senate bill
308.
Senator Misis.
Senator
Sanchez,
signature sharer
signature souls
signature Pinto.
The vote is four >> and
Senator you have a
unanimous
440.
So
back to
you,
>> Senator Compost stepped up,
Senator Sanchez, would you like to
mov'e and then we'll get compost
in here
after?
Ok.
Are you ready?
Senator?
>> Uh, thank you madam Chair.
Um, today I bring
forward a bill,
um Senate bill
409. And it's making,
uh football
Monday a
holiday
in the State of New
Mexico. It's just adding it to the
list of holidays.
I brought this bill last year
madam Chair and I know you
had some concerns about it,
didn't have basketball in it. So
this year I tried to put basketball
in it but March
madness doesn't have set
dates. So we
couldn't pick
a date to put it. So we stuck
with football Monday
and with that madam
Cheryll.
Other questions.
>> Thank you, Senator. And do
we have anybody in
the Committee room in support
of the Bill? Anybody
in a position?
Anybody on Zoom?
No, we don't. Do we have any
questions from Committee Members?
Souls
>> Senator. I, I kind of
appreciate what, what you're
doing, but
most of the other
ones that are on here,
historical or
a real context
type of things. Uh,
you know, I think this would be a slippery
slope about,
you know, the day after Halloween
being a, a
holiday.
You have multiple other ones
that you could think of and I
can't support it for that reason.
Also, uh, every time
there's a State holiday
it's expensive.
Uh, people have that day
off. Government's not working
lots of other things. I
know there are a number
of times people are like, well, people
call in sick and absent and
everything on Monday. We ought to make
it a holiday but when they
do that, they're having to take some of
their sick leave. So they kind
of already paid for
that time. And so I
can't support it. I,
I it's fun to
talk about such things like
daylight savings time or
other, um, types
of issues, but I,
I don't think it
belongs in the official
holidays of the State of New
Mexico.
>> Thank you madam Chair Mr. Senator.
And that's a great thing there is how
many people that call in sick?
And you after, I don't
think they'll be calling in sick after
Halloween. But
after football Monday started
in 2023 we had
18.8 million people
call in, in,
in here in the
United States and
it just kept going up, went up to
19.2
million, 2025.
Just recently. Here we have
22.6 million
Americans called in
sick the
day after the Super
Bowl. So the
numbers are rising.
So that's why I ran uh
football Monday.
Thank you, Mr. uh Senator and
madam Chair,
>> Senator
share
>> madam Chair. I'm just not
sure.
Would it be a friendly amendment if
we changed it to hangover
Monday?
This
madam Chair? I believe that the BS
Caucus is in agreement on
this. But
uh
wow, it is fun.
I can't support it
either
>> and for our new
Members
and
um we,
we heard this bill last
Session or the Session
before the different
sponsor
and I believe that was voted
out of this Committee.
But I, I think also
was um to entertain
a memorial that maybe
they changed um Super
Bowl Sunday to Super Bowl
Saturday
and might alleviate some of
the colleague in. But
I do have a question.
Do we know if
we have any holidays that
are half
days?
>> So, uh madam Chair,
I was just thinking that are we gonna
maybe it would be better
entertained as a two
hour delay Monday after
the
I I to answer your question,
madam. Chair, I off
the top of my head. I don't
know if we have any holidays that are half
days
