bill thank you very much Mr
president colleagues because
it's a pretty consequential bill
I would say that does two things
number one it strengthens an
existing task force in New
include homeland security
department the Indian Affairs
Department the State Land Office
we also give this task force
which is authorized and required
which of course we're
You know there's a possibility
of here in New Mexico the other
thing colleagues it does is it
prohibits that the storage and
disposal of spent fuel or high
disposal facility and a
repository if a repository as
defined in federal law which is
a deep geological repository
which is what the federal law
says is a safe way to store high
repositories in operation and we
consent
I will say colleagues.
This is a consequential bill
because what's being proposed
to be stored in the state of New
Mexico.
It would come in via rail
through all parts in New Mexico
this is not just a southeastern
New Mexico issue it's a national

our state did not ask for this
in fact our state really doesn't

just say Texas was confronted
with a similar situation you may

partisan issue it's really about
states rights in a way it's
about doing things the right way
to the federal government that
we support a consent based

And so that's that's pretty
pretty big risk for everyone

I do think that if the federal
government wants us to store all
this waste they probably ought
to pass is a state to do it.
which maybe Senator Griggs will
Senator Steinborn Mr president
Senator no not directly.
Senator Brandt this presents
center do you have any expertise
in the security of radioactive
that expertise so we can ask
some serious questions Mr
president center I do have an
expert witness and happy to
bring amount of fact when we do
that right now and then I'd love
please escort the expert witness
into the chamber.
And bring a chair for him said.
Mr presence on our while he's
involving all aspects of
transportation security rail
transport I've worked with the
people at the national labs who
concerns not just now but in the
future so safe to say I've taken
a deep dive on all these issues
but happy to answer all your
questions Senator Brandt thank

estimated thirteen rail
accidents I mean.
Mr president center on those
thirteen rail accidents how many
did they recommend that they say
significant risk risk of leakage
they determined it would be very
low risk of radiation exposure.
Not that that brings me any
comfort
we have real accidents all the
time.
I'm a little more concerned with
the rail car that's got a tanker
on it carrying
actually tested these capsules
with a missile.
And it didn't leak so I'm not
sure what the concern is on the
rail accidents.

one thing you learn about
nuclear safety this kind of
interesting is it's not the
thing you plan for that always
happens it's things that don't
wrong kind of Kitty litter
remember that caused an
explosion of a drum and a
billion dollar incident I think
one of the most expensive
cleanups and nuclear history
you know anybody and if you go
to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and you look at the
issue of nuclear accidents what
they say on their website is
that it is inherently fallible
assurances let alone guarantees
with a grain of salt because
there's no such thing as a
guarantee of safety when it
comes to anything really
this building fact you probably
shouldn't stay in this building
either if you're looking for
guarantees because there is no
guarantee of tomorrow there's no
guarantee of the next minute.

fabrication of truth.
As well as almost any other.
movie that talks about hazardous
there's very little if any
chance in less the Russian army
here probably the Chinese army
is more likely at this point you
know comes in and tries to take
over those facilities you know
areas for the for the waste so
you know I think we can have an
honest discussion about the
policies of the state in New
Mexico when it comes to nuclear
direct strike by missile and not
leak.
I think we can have that
discussion I still may actually
support your bill I'm excited
yet.
But I don't need the fear
mongering that is going into
the federal government to pay to
store all this year I think you
can experiment for state.
Because I'm not worried about
the security and I'm not worried
about the safety.
Misprint etcetera so if an
accident happens and no one got
sick from and no one died from
it then yeah it costs money to
clean it up.
I'd rather nuclear power plant.
Then a solar field that covers
So let's get away Chernobyl
happened a long time ago with
very old technology we don't
need to be scared of Chernobyl
anymore.
The new technologies coming
along to take the level for
materials and put it back in
nuclear power plants and have it
used tells level two.
Let's take a look at the facts.
And then let's decide on these
policies I absolutely agree the
federal government should ask
But let's not talk about rail
accidents and security incidents

They don't exist.
And when there's no danger from

this nuclear waste today if it's
not in this underground facility
that you say we're supposed to
have.
So Mister president senator so
it's actually facility that's
high level nuclear waste which
is spent fuel which is sitting
at power plants around the
country where it was generated.
So.
This presents was just sitting
Mr president Senator not exactly
that image that you have you
know the nuclear industry the
federal government was supposed
to have a permanent facility
back in the eighties under
these nuclear rods when they're
powering power plant or
thermally hot the radio act they
have to sit and those cooling
ponds for years then the cycle
would be stored here not really
into runs that's a different
kind of waste and that would be
safe for these guys these guys
are stored in what are called
And we spent as a federal as a
nation we spend billions of
dollars working on yucca
mountain and yet the mounts

more.
Waiting for the accident
happened because well it's
inherently fallible technology
So Senator Brandt talk about
these rail cars.
And I believe that it was New
Mexico tech.
Right here in New Mexico.
So if you can't break one.
Senator Brandt said you know it
did it the action actually
happen if a tree falls and was
nobody hears it.
But more importantly I thank you
Mr president we need to look at
the it what.
Nuclear power can do for us.
the waste from solar panels
because right now we make a lot
of those and we've never
addressed what we do with them
we've never addressed what we do
with all of the.
me with solar panels or anything
else for that matter so we've
got electric cars we got
electronics all over the place
and we we pretty much.
Nord that because it's
The whole cycle.
And if we count for nuclear
power can be a wait wait wait
You know it it.

But too many of us don't
understand the difference

We have the right place we have

no reason to stay to try to stop

We do have further debate with
senator Ortiz subpoena.
Senator you know.
Thank you Mr president and
As unusual it is for me to stand
myself in that curious position.
And I I ask myself what what
what about my experience.
Leads me to support them rather
The beneficial aspects of the
atom we're all we were talking
about yeah we were diving under
school desks to worry about
atomic bomb but we also we're
messages I don't necessarily
think we should fear to.
In accord  with what Senator
share was saying.
and I and I know when I bring it
Atlantic monthly this month the
the the issue of Atlantic
magazine very good article I
recommended to the to read about
the reality of nuclear power in
the world in this country and it
it because it's so dangerous it
actually has has worked pretty
well but that there's now a new
a new generation of nuclear
hooked up in in link together
took to produce lots of energy
or.
Lou you know individually
operated to power a specific
existing nuclear power plants
they can operated much lower
temperatures and so what we
would be storing it whole tech
is not.
And that would provide.
What many conservation groups
now view as the missing element
renewable affordable
the alternative energy source
that is a green source they
treated as green energy.
at it this way if if engineers
are envisioning the use of these
materials in the next generation
of electric generators using
nuclear power.
from where the whole tech plant
is is envisioned why are they
worried and I'm not hearing
anything from people down there.
And the people that came to

I think it's.
in our state what is so far away
and when the people down there
say it's fine with us so with
that I'm I'm gonna have to
propose Senator Steinborn bill
thank you Mr president Senator
just want to take a few moments
to make some remarks to kind of
think out loud so from now I
want to thank all the folks who
approach me that gentlelady from
this chamber for for quite some
time and I appreciate the
gentleman providing for for what
he believes in because this is
It's a bummer that these things
armaments and nuclear weapons
and when you look back at the
build up of nuclear weapons in
this country
the the expenditures of public
monies to make nuclear weapons
and so it is ironic that that my
hometown did how does have a
laboratory next to it with a lot
of employees but a positive
ripple effects.
The up up north at Los Alamos.
Those kind of ideal spot to put
a secret scientific laboratory
back in the forties
but that had out a big dramatic
change on the on the culture and

So it just begs the question
what responsibility do we have
on
Nagasaki or Hiroshima but I but
in New Mexico.
It has permission I don't think
we got any tax credits for it
of that in my opinion but at the
same time you we we have to
store it somewhere and so that's
what I'm struggling that's from
Starkey and that that's all at

energy into nuclear energy and
allowing each and every fifty
state to defer to determine
whether where the waste would
work go what we're to go I
believe every state house in the
for not there's that there's a
case on point Mr president
gentleman from the came out of
Utah in the tenth circuit which
is you know is the same
letter from the then Attorney
General to Senator Steinborn
July nineteen.
Two hundred eighteen two
thousand eighteen rather the
tenth circuit found that federal
specifically page twelve fifty
for the courts concluding
remarks were clear on point
quote in holding the Utah
statutes preempted we do not
seeking effective solutions
however in the matter of nuclear
safety Congress has determined
that it is the federal
government and not the states
decision because there's two
things that I get a now talk
about number one there's a very
important bit bit of case law
which everybody interesting case
funny to look at it's called
Pacific gas and electric.
and as we've talked about as the
governor is that we are worried
about economic malpractice the
oil industry worried about you
know hurting hurting the oil our
decision they said that salik
California's prohibition fell
outside of the brown.
a lot about the economic aspect
of it very similar California
the other thing I want to talk
about Mr chairman is exactly why
this bill is needed why our
pass a law to regulate spent
fuel.
And the federal government said
you cannot regulate spent fuel
we regulate spent fuel we don't
have that option we don't have
hired a bunch of lobbyists to
fight us from day one when we
just ask for an impact study
which was the bill that the
Senate passed several years ago
the higher lobbyist even look at
pursuing the same thing.
Having said all that Mister
chair Mister president
colleagues want to point out
something real interesting about
uranium.
Then New Mexico and our native
communities
Mr presence and yeah so the Utah
decision is a little apple
orange with what we're dealing
with here because we're not
trying to regulate spent till
we're closer what California
did.
you're saying with regards to
the.
Nine circuit I'm looking at the
bill.
Essentially this doesn't
to outlaw on economic activity
proposed project but it doesn't
quite outlaw the activity all
right I'm looking on page for
Mister president up in the
middle I could direct the the
gentleman to it.
store or depose of but it but
here's where I'm confused with
regards to the language on on
page.
Constructs some looking at the
transuranic contaminated waste
or low level waste and then in
paragraph B. it says a person
shall not store or depose of
In the bill or or what is it
reference low level waste in a
reference high level waste.
Could you explain that to me Mr
president Senator Steinborn yes
Mr president senators for the
says we won't allow the storage
of radioactive waste here unless
we can Kerr so.
What we what what this bill does
is it adds high level waste in
establishes terms for
the storage of high level waste
in the probation public's.
Thank you Mr president and and
gentleman Mr president yes added
but you have to add to that that
it is prohibited unless those
two things happen consulate.
doesn't suggest the legislative
branch so we talking at a
cabinet secretary the normal
permits that that a similar
when we pass this bill I would
think that an act of the
legislature signed by the
governor will definitely meet
the bar of not consenting and
not concurring but current law
raises the bar on the parameters
of the terms in which we really
would allow this material to be
define
whether or not a state.
Basically the their defining the
whole process based on whether
or not a state consents so we
thank you gentleman no I think I
think of this bill were to pass
I think it would up outlined
that the state has to consent or
conquer this would necessarily
cabinet members for legislation
to me want to look at that if
this bill continues and then the
second prong Mr president is
that on no this cannot happen
What United States code is that
referring to what what laws that
make in reference to thank you
Mr president senators so that is
the nuclear waste policy act
Thank you Mr president I think
that's that's that's kind of
clever but it's kind of a
contradiction with all due
respect it did suggesting that
we won't allow storage
so so essentially you know just
kind of makes it impossible
And then improbable because once
the repository.
Is is created up.
What I'm struggling with Mister
president gentleman is the is
the distance between my my home
town and this proposed site.
It's approximate two hundred
me to dictate to somewhere else.
What to do with their local
economy partly one always say
appear is diversify diversify
telling Shreveport Louisiana no
it would be the equivalent of
someone in Detroit telling
buffalo no sometimes we forget
which elected officials granted
there's not a whole lot of
democratic elected official but
those Democrats that are elected
down there.
we try to build bridges between
Albuquerque and our friends in
the Permian.
because of the political divide
is just too much and I think of
Mr president the up I think I'm
I'm.
You know I'm not sure we're
gonna go on this one I'm listing
real hard to the to the reasons
for.
And and there's great reasons
states would be fifty to nothing
are that's why I think
preemption gonna prevail and and
you got to put it somewhere if
you look on a map and Lindros
circle and and at a population
It would be preferable so in my.
Concerned about New Mexico or in
my concern about the United
States or my concern about the
earth.
You know but I think if.
topography the the lack of
population.
and the dryness of that area so
so I'm gonna listen.
I I just cannot what is Mr
remind everybody this waste will
travel through all of our
communities.
You know I first learned about
this this was the argument we
heard well this is just about
see this waste will go through
Bernalillo county it will go
through Luna County it will go
through McKinley County will go
through Santa Fe County it will
go through Dona Ana County and
this waste multiple times so the
reason for it is colleagues and
says premature to two big
reasons I will give you number
one it's disrespectful to the

company shutting this down our
seven this down our throats well
we have a simultaneous consent
based process but number two to
the issue of safety is really
they're putting this material
and cast their only license for
forty years themselves but there
is no permanent storage
facility.
about now not about you walk
around a dry cask storage right
now five minutes ago what
happens in twenty thirty years
sitting on the desert we have
ten thousand of them when these
New Mexico in so so it's a
safety issue it's also a states
rights issue and and and we
don't have to buy into the false
choice Mister president senator
that we either do this and we're
with real financial incentives
with real safety assurances and
the federal government really
needs to get closer permanent
storage so that if they really
wanted to interim storage that

make sure that the amendments

several projects that have been
suggested over time and for one
reason or another they decided

E. lawsuit that was taken to
Supreme Court in the course the
state of California does have
the opportunity and the right to

about storage and the preemption
issue is an important issue that
this state is going to have to
face at some point and there are
a lot of different kinds of
preemption and I'm not an
attorney but I will tell you
for the storage then then they
will go forward and we'll figure
out I'm sure the courts have

And that would be a real shame
in just ask anyone from a Los

transportation issue came up and
they built a great relief route
around Santa Fe so it wouldn't

So transportation is an
important issue and it's
interesting how this particular
issue shifted from a the
facts with regard to
transportation I don't know if
you're aware but we're already
transporting high level nuclear
waste across this country.
We've already talked about.
The safety of the cask we know
that they are and if there is an

about the economic benefit to
New Mexico.
People have been talking over
the last couple years about
diversity and and I think this
is already been mentioned I hate
There is no other community in
New Mexico that is going to have
a more difficult time.
And it seems a little bit ironic
that everyone in the chamber
wants to diversify but when we
try to diversify we're not last
I know there are few people in
our area they probably are not
as supportive and and probably
object and don't consent we for
it from them.
But the majority of my

over time just the gross

going to be significant to the
state of New Mexico and then in
addition to that the money that
It was mentioned that the
accident with underground was of
concern it certainly was.
That the creation of that
A very significant fine this is
appropriate.
You know I think a lot of
students has been said today.
We have the right to try and do
what we can to support our
people the jobs it would create
the money that would bring to
our area.
Not only that the majority.
So with that I think that's
about all I have to say on this
and
I know that the Sanchez worked
We've heard the NRC reports have
been favorable.
And that is just frustrating for
me to have to go home and and
say well once again southeast
And even for the state of New

obviously people from across the
state know better what's best

The other thing Mr president is

that was proposed to be built so
yes the state how to see whether
the term storage was adequate
for a facility that would be

See this go through all agree
Thank you senator Montez we do

Thank you Mr president thank you
members for the debate you know
Wirth so you know something is
going on in Texas the difference
in terms of the debate that's
going on here in New Mexico but
center Steinborn you explore a
little bit more
this is a temporary.
Storage facility and this is the
our country of trying to find a
permanent storage facility I'm
just trying to figure out of

So Mister president senator I
think Senator Baca talked about

going to be on board you know we

really what we want for the

opportunity to speak with my
local sheriffs about this

really a step towards
decriminalising traffic

so it becomes an afternoon of

and we want to hold our

important I know to fix a lot of
people and a lot of people

Thank you Senator Pirtle.
The debate we have Senator
Brandt.
Thank you Mr president with the
misprint happy to Senator Brandt
thank you Mr president and and
of the.
So Senator how is the court's
this this is taking the ability
of motor vehicles.
To.
Basically take away a driver's
go down that road so what the
piece though that's going away
here is the driver's license and
I was just I didn't say this in
the opening and I should of I
eight thousand.
So I think this is a major issue
and I think we have a lot of
people in exactly the situation
Senator Pirtle was in
that's important to provide is
still there it's just you can't
use the driver's licenses as a
collection vehicle for that
fine.
the threat of losing your
license get people actually pay
their fine.
Well Mister Mister president
Senator Brandt I would suggest
that given there's three hundred
they've got the right to do
bench warrants or Ritz a
garnishment there's a whole
string of tools collection tools
that are there it's just this
what what about so if I was
texting while driving and I got
a ticket for that and didn't pay
for that than than what I lose
my license or would that be one
of the situations were I
wouldn't.
the motor vehicles code and that
is exactly the kind of thing
that could if it wasn't paid
build up and ultimately somehow
work its way to motor vehicles
and then lo and behold you end
appear in this building in lots
of different capacities who've
had that experience of being
pulled over to find out for the
first time their licenses been
suspended and again.
collections thank you Mr
president I I do support this
bill and
but I'm wondering can I
symbolically vote in favor of
it.
No further debate senator Wirth

provision they could not size it
more than a hundred twenty
percent of their average annual
usage it just removes that
hundred twenty percent cap the
reason for this is as people are
to all electric all electric
cooking that the hundred twenty
percent cap would not allow them
to right size the solar system
that they are putting on the
hundred twenty percent made good
based on putting a very large
solar system on their house but
now that those of all gone away
it doesn't make sense to keep
that cap and actually prevents
people from right sizing a solar
we're debating Senate bill fifty
six.
Senator read to debate center
press thank you Mr present with
the sponsor yield center soci
old.
Certainly.
These solar photovoltaic system
I was using shorthand.
Thank you Mr president I was
really wondering how I would be
able to do that.
No I didn't know I was god could
the and there's some concern
with how the infrastructure that
is currently in place isn't.
in place to be able to handle
of the companies to put in all
of the infrastructure that's
needed they are able to recoup
all of those costs through the
PRC and through their rate base
and so they've got the capacity
and so the build out is going to
come slowly.
So Mister president senator.
If if they're gonna have to put
in these new systems who's going
the requirements that we have
passed for the utilities to put
those on.
Thank you Mr president Sir I'm
pretty sure voted no on that one
but
A for the expanded.
infrastructure for people that
do.
Mr president and senator people
that would go on up with any of
that are.
The extra pieces that might come
with grid modernization if
somebody is totally off the grid
where they've got full battery
appreciate those answers
so it is this the main reason my
electric bill has skyrocketed
this year.
Mister president senator I have
the I'm I'm guessing that this
the the wonderful bill you're
talking about the past
previously as part of the reason
why Mr president center
do people get paid.
they did currently they get paid
only a small amount and that is
actually based on and it's
uploading number based on what
the cost of energy is it's
actually the avoided cost of
of energy would be a fool's
errand there it doesn't make any
sense to oversize a system
thinking that it's going to be
your retirement plan to get rich
off of it.
the utility company would pay in
their their wholesaler for the
power is at the costs that they
are going to charge me for
power.
Mr president and senator if I
when you asked about your very
large bill some of that is
because the cost of energy to
the utilities to find that
electricity was substantially
higher this year than in prior
So much present center that's
because we pass the energy
transition act I I I think I
understand now
so so this is just going to make
percent of what they normally
use all right.
Mr president and senator yes it
takes away that arbitrary
hundred twenty percent so the
people can right size their
systems.
electric vehicle but wouldn't
that increase their usage.
Mister president senator yes.
Mr president you certainly seem
to understand the bill now.
Senator Brandt so thank you Mr
president Center at will what
you just said is the bill is
completely unnecessary thank
