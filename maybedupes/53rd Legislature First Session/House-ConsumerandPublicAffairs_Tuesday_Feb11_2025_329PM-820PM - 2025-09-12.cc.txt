Representative block.
Presentative Lord here
representative Romero.
Representative Thompson.
Madam Vice Chair.
He
A I'm sure, yeah, I'm sure we
have a form.
OK, now represent Matthews.
You'd like to go ahead and
explain how 111.
Search for missing qualified
service animal.
Yes, thank you very much, Madam
She member so the committee.
Um
With me today is Rose Romero.
Um
HBO 111 started out with a water
main explosion on the street in
the northeast heights of
Albuquerque last July.
And um
Rose was there.
Um, with her.
Dog Ivy, who for 11 years had
helped her.
And after the water main
explosion.
Um
It was
11 days.
Before Rose knew whether or not
Ivy had survived he had not.
The reason was because emergency
responders.
Uh, just failed to adequately
search for her.
So HB 111 is uh intended to
amend the service Animal Act,
which is an existing statute.
to essentially say that if a
first responder at a made aware
that the owner has seen my dog.
Then provider show to the extent
practicable and well
prioritizing.
Thank you. Human safety, make a
reasonable effort to.
So my expert today with me is
Rose O Merrill.
And we'll go to the audience. Is
there anyone in um uh anyone
opposed to this bill.
Um, is there anyone in support.
HP
It would take the mic up to.
And we're gonna to stick with
one minute cause we have so many
bills to get through and
We're starting late. Thank you,
Madam Chair of the committee,
Jim Jackson for both disability
rights in New Mexico and the
disability coalition. Uh, we
support this bill, and I just
guess I wanna make one important
point that a service animal,
well, in Mexico and across the
country service animal now is
almost always the dog, uh, it's
not an emotional support animal
of any other kind. It's almost
always a dog.
And the connection between a
person with a disability and
their service animal is a really
important and close one.
We all, uh, maybe and often have
had pets and so on and were
closely attached to our pets,
but the connection between a
person with a disability and
they're specially trained
service animal is on a whole
another level and so separating
those uh folks or having a
person with a disability in a
position where they, they don't
know where their animal is,
whether they're safe because
it's an emergency. Um, so this
extra effort to search for those
uh missing animals is a really
critical uh piece for people
with disabilities.
Thanks.
Great timing. OK, is there
anyone else? OK, you'd like to
get the mic.
Thank you.
My name is Brian Pritchard and
I'm here as a representative for
Service Dogs of New Mexico and
the Academy of Canine
Excellence, and we are in full
support of this.
Just as the previous speaker
mentioned, it is a completely
different bond, and it is a life
changing thing and to lose that
completely alters their entire
life.
So we fully support this.
Thank you. I think there's. My
name is Grace Montano Irwin, and
I'm the government affairs
Logistics Associate for Animal
Protection voters. We are
standing here today in support
of House Bill 111.
Having served in various for, I
can speak firsthand to the
devastation.
devastation is even greater and
in some cases, life altering
with the law.
111 is a, I believe it is our
responsibility, depend on the
assistance of qualified service
animals by allowing them to
receive the best protection
possible under our state's law.
The loss of a sur animal is not
such difficulty in resolving.
Passing this bill would help to
ensure humans and their
qualified surface animals are
given the best chance and have.
Thank you.
Anyone else
OK, um.
I can't read the names.
Reynolds.
You have one minute, please.
I can hear me.
Yes, we can.
Hi, my name is.
I'm here
111.
I first met Roach shortly after
the devastating water main
explosion on July 28th.
Which partially collapsed and I
learned about Ivy seeing eye
service dog who went missing
during the event.
Um, on the day of the explosion,
the fire department conducted a
brief research and assured Rose
the IV was not in the home or
the garage.
Um, however, as we know this
search not grow and
rows and
immense stress.
Desperately trying to also
dealing with the trauma of
losing her home. So while she
was displaced in a hotel, um, a
lot of us community members.
Um, got together to search for
Ivy in the neighborhood's
surrounding Rose's house.
Um, and after searching for a
couple of weeks.
It came, we came to the
conclusion that she must have
still been in the house and so
after a community member crawled
through the debris and rubble in
her house, um, we did find Ivy
and this was just a
heartbreaking loss that could
have been prevented with a more
thorough search to begin with
and could have had a, a much
better and happier outcome. So I
feel like this just highlights
the urgent need for Bill 111 to
ensure that service animals are
not overlooked in emergencies.
something like this never
happens again. Thank you.
Renee
Hi, can you hear me? Yes, you
have one minute. Yes,
this is Rene Moya. I was also
one of the search volunteers um
for IB and was actually by
Rosa's side when I was body was
recovered. Um, I support this
bill because service animals are
an extension of a human life and
vital to the emotional and
mental well-being and quality of
life of people with disabilities
and medical conditions. I really
do believe that if this law
would have been in place, it
could have not only prevented
all the stress and induced
medical issues that caused Rose,
but possibly the
and the life of this service
talk
there, there was no training
protocol, resources, or support
to take the necessary measures
to search and recover IV. The
fire department tried, but they
didn't ask the right questions.
They didn't consider the typical
service animal behavior, if they
would have asked, where does IV
frequent, she would have been
found in the spot that she was
recovered in a place that she
often went to. And if that
search would have been conducted
in that specific area. We may
have been able to
recover.
I also feel like if there had
been protocol law and
prioritization of Service, a
structural engineer, a train
canon canine
may have been called in sooner.
These are all things that happen
11 days later because of the
pressure of the community.
volunteers that came together to
try to support Rose and save his
stock.
Thank you, Renee. OK, we'll go
um back. Do you have anything
else that you'd like to.
And before we go to the
committee.
I'm sorry. Is there anything
else you'd like to add before we
go to the committee?
Uh, no, I, I think we're um
Representative Thompson.
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Just uh
just briefly, um, what is the
cost to train.
Uh, a seeing eye dog.
Ma here, uh.
Ask Rose to answer that, please.
40,000.
From the mic.
Thank you. So that's quite an
investment. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Representative Lord, thank you,
Madam Chair. Thank you expert
and.
Mr. Mer, I'm horribly sorry for
your loss. I remember when that
story came on and I was just
incredibly sad and I can't even
imagine what you went through.
That was just a horrifying
story. I think it broke
everyone's heart in New Mexico,
I don't think anybody didn't
shed a tear over that.
Um, Madam Chair and expert.
Sorry, Ms. Romero.
So I wanna make sure I'm
understanding the bill and its
totality when when we're on page
one.
21
We are not including emotional
support animals, comfort
animals, or therapy animals.
It's only qualified service and,
is that correct?
Um
Madam Chair, representative,
yes, that is. So Madam Chair, on
page 2.
When we're talking about.
Uh, first responder.
And anyone who's gonna come
there as the first person on the
scene, a law enforcement
officer, a firefighter.
An emergency medical service
provider.
Can you explain to me?
What that process will look
like, well, they'll be.
Training for all first
responders so that they know
what to ask.
Do you have a qualified service
dog.
Where do you think that dog
would be? I mean, what, how are
they gonna, how is this gonna be
implemented, Madam Chair.
Representative.
Uh
Manage representative, thank you
for the question. Um,
We anticipate.
Well, let me back up just for a
second, um.
We, we are obviously living in a
world in which
Um, there are incredible.
fires and floods and, and, and
tornadoes and hurricanes and so
forth.
And
So
Presumably we're gonna have,
there's such a volume now of of
this kind of uh
Happening in the world and in
our country.
That it would be calm.
Uh
Common for training to deal with
first responders who are having
to make a decision.
About the priorities. I mean, as
we saw with the California
fires, I mean people were
obviously concerned about their
pets and so forth, and what this
bill does, I think, is.
Say first of all,
Priority human life.
Because you're so important to
the people they serve.
And then 3 pets and so forth,
um, and so I, I think that what
we're likely to see
I
um just making first responders
aware.
Um
That when you know there's a
service animal, you need to
make.
that your priority at your human
life and I
The concept that that would take
a huge amount of training, I
think is
Probably not very realistic. It
would, it's, it's not that
difficult and typically somebody
with a service animal is gonna
say, we gotta have a service
animal.
Um,
please, please. Thank you, Madam
Chair and the reason I was
asking so many questions on that
is because.
I know how everything works. We
all know how the sausage is
made. Just wanna make sure.
That
Once this passes that it gets
implemented quickly and.
Thoroughly, meaning.
That every first responder.
Even
Anyone who shows up.
In an ambulance.
Knows
that they need to interview the
person immediately.
I think that that, that's
probably.
I guess
I know it's up to them to do it
themselves, but I look at it, I
would love some wording, but I'm
not asking you to change it. I
would love to see where it's
like immediately first
responder, any first responder
must ask the following
questions. Is there anybody else
in the house? Is there a service
animal. I think that's the only
thing I would add it, but, but
that's OK, I still support the
bill, um.
Have you, Madam Chair and
representative, have you had any
feedback from law enforcement
trainers or
Any firefighters or anybody who
has talked to you about, I'm
sure they support the bill but
about how they would implement
the bill moving forward.
Uh, Madam Chair Representative,
we've not had any conversation
with responders about how they
would implement it, but I think
the fact that no, uh, first
responders came and opposed this
bill.
Uh, indicate that uh this will
not be burden.
There's no particular cost
associated with it.
Um, they're not opposing the
bill is an indication that they
Madam Chairman representative,
I'm trying to think, um, how
OK, because this is a very quick
situation, right? It needs to be
dealt with right in the moment.
Who else is in the house?
It's our service animal because
they've got to now ask those
questions and make sure that
gets hammered into everybody
who's being a first responder.
Is there gonna be
Madam Chair representative, what
type and you're out.
I'm trying to think of every
scenario, so hold on. They're
out, you're outside, house is
flooded house on fire,
whatever's happening in the
house.
I like that you didn't require
them to ask.
But is there anything that could
get hung up on.
A first responder saying, is it
a qualified service dog? and do
you have?
Any paperwork or proof of that.
I'm Chasson.
And is there, do you have
paperwork? sorry.
You shaking your head over
there. I'm representative. I get
my nails done by where you guys
are at, so I know where you are.
I mentioned ribs and um.
Is there any paperwork or
documentation just in case in
the worst case scenario,
somebody asked that question.
Chair Representative Ashgrove,
when you get your dog, they give
you an identification card with
yourself and the dog that
identifies the dog and the
person.
So you do have a card.
From, well, I went to the leader
dog program, and that is what I
was given.
So I always carry that with me
in my purse.
OK, Madam Chair, representative,
I think the other part of that,
which isn't in here, but I think
it's an important part is to
make sure that we also train the
people.
That have service animals that
they know to have some sort of
documented just in case somebody
were to ask. It's just my, my
thing. I'm trying to think every
scenario if the sponsor.
would allow.
And in short.
I am aware of one system where
you can opt in to let them know
that you have a service animal,
and then it goes directly to
their dashboard if a first
responder is to come on the
scene.
Thank you for that. I appreciate
that, Madam Chair
Representative, I would.
Also
As I'm looking at the whole bill
in its entirety, looking at the
kind of the wraparound stuff and
that.
Uh, more awareness to people who
have.
Qualified service animals to the
trainers.
Uh, to law enforcement so that
everybody knows I would even
with that was in our budget in
the future to include.
Something to make sure that
everybody who has
A qualified service and and
understand that they could call
911.
Get that listed in there because
I didn't know that to right.
And also to make sure that
they're carrying on the paper
just in case.
say that.
Uh, Madam Chair, I don't think
there should be, and I'm just
gonna ask.
This question
Is there any penalty if somebody
were to say yes, I have.
A bunch of service dogs in there
and they're not. I'm gonna guess
that wouldn't be because to me,
honestly in this bill, I wish it
was for every animal that's in
the house, period, but I, I
understand where this is coming.
There's no penalty, right? If
somebody says I have service
dogs and they really don't.
Somebody who's abusing the
system.
Madam, madam chair.
Representative, I'm not sure.
I understood the question. Say
you have a service dog and you
don't, don't, yeah, like if
somebody knew that this was an
option that they could say
because they want their dog, I
mean, who doesn't want their
animals saved, I love my dogs
more than most people.
So I would want somebody to go
and save them and I'm sure,
but I guess it's kind of a mute
question. I just don't want
people to abuse it. I guess
that's what I'm trying to say,
and I guess it wouldn't make
sense to make a penalty because
everybody's gonna be emotional
about their pets and want you to
go in there and save them, and I
don't see a lot of misuse of
that. So Madam Chair and
Representative, I have a
question on page 4,
if a first responder at an
emergency situation is made
where the owner, trainer, or
handlers qualified servants
animals missing. The first
responded to the extent
Practical.
I'm gonna skip that.
And while prioritizing human
safety and security shall make a
reasonable effort to search.
For the service animal
So Madam Chair and
representative, so I, I'm gonna
guess you're alluding to that
when they get there, I mean if
the.
there's gonna be dangerous
situations where you can't get
in, is that what you're trying
to get at that it's too
dangerous to go in, but you're
gonna do everything reasonable
that you can.
Madam Chair Representative, yes,
um, the priority is human life.
And um that would include the
first responders. I would
interpret it to mean that.
Chairman Representative, I don't
think I really have any more
questions, but I support the
bill. I just, unfortunately in
this line of work when work I
try to think of every possible
scenario. What happens if
somebody does use
but especially our qualified
service dogs.
I it's such a service, um,
actually listened to an audible
not too long ago about a girl
that.
Lost her eyesight if something
Just keep in mind, short answers
so we can um, any questions so
we can get through tonight.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I
totally understand. I think
they're
There are questions still to be
asked, but I, I will do my best.
So thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative and experts, and
thank you all for being here.
Thank you, Ms. Romero, for, for
being here with us and everybody
who's testified. So I guess I'm
just trying to get a little more
clarity. And I think we were on
the, I'm going to go back to the
same page that Representative
Lord was at reasonable effort,
Madam Chair Representative, do
we have a definition of what a
reasonable effort is, because I
was a service animal owner.
And I
I, I may have a different
definition of what's a
reasonable effort for
individuals to uh be looking,
madam, and representative.
Uh, Madam Chair Representative,
uh, we do not have a Thank you,
Madam Chair. Thank you,
Representative. I guess my next
question would be about that.
Definition. So what would you, I
mean, cause if this was ever
going to have to be litigated or
something in the future. We want
to know what your legislative
intent is. So, Madam Chair
Representative, I do want to
understand what that
That would be
Would it be a day, would it be a
week? How, how long would that
reasonable effort
Be to look for that service
animal, Madam Chair
representative.
Uh, Madam Chair representative
uh.
It would depend on the
circumstances of the case as a
lawyer.
Um, when I practice law.
Um
All cases depend upon the
circumstances and the facts that
you're given, I think.
The reasonable
Effort is modified by extent
practicable.
And prioritizing human safety,
so I think there are guidelines
there to make that
determination.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative. So I, I guess I
understand I I see.
What we're saying a reasonable
effort, but I just don't want
people to say, oh, they, they
didn't give a reasonable effort.
And since the legislation says
shall.
I just want to make sure that
we're not saying, OK, well, in
the future, I think you didn't
give a reasonable effort even
though it took maybe a week to
find a dog, which hopefully
doesn't happen, but
If it did, could there be then?
Liability for the first
responders.
If they claim that they didn't
take enough of a reasonable
effort. That's kind of why I, I
wish there was some kind of
definition in there to say, what
does that mean? And what is a
reasonable effort in this, in
this case. So have you, have you
seen similar instances where
that could have happened, maybe
in other states that may have
had similar legislation. I'd
appreciate if the, if the
The folks in the audience would
uh let the lady answer the
question. Thank you so much.
Me
shared
Representative
The question was, oh, I'm sorry.
Have you seen other cases around
the country where there has been
similar statutes like reasonable
effort, and there has been
litigation that followed, Madam
Chair and Representative
Representative, uh,
I'm not personally familiar with
other cases and that.
Category, but.
As a lawyer, I can't imagine
that they're probably aren't
somewhere, but they may not be
reported.
Uh, it's common like.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, Representative. OK.
Well, I guess, uh, that's just
One thing that gives me a little
bit of a.
Of an issue, but I mean, I
support your legislation. So,
continuing here, Madam Chair
Representative, I'm just going
to go, I know this is current
language, so I'm not going to
get too into it. But
I know that we talk about
different service animals. I
know a few years ago we had a
big, there was a bill to
increase.
The amount of service folk
service animals that are
qualified service animals to
dogs, and then also miniature
horses, Madam Chair
Representative, uh,
Can you tell me how many service
dogs are in the state currently
who are qualified service
animals or how many miniature
horses that are currently being
used in the statement, Madam
Chair, since this would apply to
them.
representative, no, I cannot.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair. I
just, I just wanted to know.
Pretty much how many and I'm
sure I can, I can figure it out
because
I think that would be important,
especially in my district, we
have a lot of dogs in my
district, and I don't know how
many are are service dogs, madam
chair. Do you have
more questions about the bill. I
do, and this is pertaining
directly to this bill, madam
chair. And so,
We're talking about the dogs and
the horses that are in question.
So I, I just was wondering how
many there are. So, OK, Madam
Chair, next year, I have a
question.
So first responders, Madam Chair
Representative, is this
including the search and rescue
crews, or is it just?
First on the scene.
When we're talking about those
folks, Madam
there is a lines 23.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative. So,
uh, I see that and then an
emergency medical service
provider.
Would that just be any kind of
EMT or what would that include,
Madam Chair? That's on line 8,
page 2.
Madam Chair, representative uh
within that profession, I think
those.
Understood. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you,
Representative. And then I guess
So
What if the dog or the horse
gets injured?
During the time that there's
this emergency.
And
How are we to find
And determine
Who is is liable for that
because I'm sure Madam Chair
Representative.
There, there may be cases where
that dog or that miniature horse
were injured. And so could you
just give me some information
about the protections that we
have for, for first responders.
So that if it does get injured,
it may be in a reasonable effort
to to rescue them, but how do we
make sure that that dog or that
horse
I uh
That doesn't result in uh
Litigation and
And what protections are there
for those first responders?
If that dog or horse get
injured, Madam Chair and
representative. Madam Chair,
Representative, all cases
involving liability of the
situation
and.
As to
The variety of
OK, Madam Chair, thank you
representative. So I guess I
just had some questions from law
enforcement about what their
liability would be when it comes
to that.
individual
Situation where they have to go
in.
Protect
The individual first, right? And
then there's the service animal
afterward. If they have to find
this individual.
Madam Chair, I'd really
appreciate it if the audience
would not be as vocal. Would we
be able to tell the audience
that?
It's being taken care of, but I
think the frustration is that
they've been waiting since 1:30
and.
This bill should be fairly
simple, and I don't think
liability is covered in this
bill beyond what a regular um
EMS law enforcement responders
would be.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and I,
and I understand and you know,
with the legislature, we don't,
we can't say specifically when
bills will be heard. I wish we
could, but I also think it's
incredibly important to
thoroughly vet legislation
before we pass it. And so
that's, that's why I'm asking
these important questions,
because if there's an unintended
consequences in the future, at
least our constituents know that
we did ask these questions. So
continuing on my line of
questioning, Madam Chair,
Representative.
So will the service animal once
recovered, be held for a period
of time to ensure that they
haven't been picking up disease
or been injured within the time
that we were looking for them.
What is the protocol on that to
ensure that the service animal
is indeed in good health before
being, being a
Given back to the owner, Madam
Chair, and represent.
Uh,
man representative.
I mean, I'm not quite sure what
you're asking.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. So the question
was essentially, what is the
What is the protocol?
From recovering a service
animal.
returning it to its owner.
Is there any kind of
Tests or medical care that's
given to that animal to ensure
the safety of it before it
returns to the owner.
Uh, Madam chair representative,
that would be a fact-specific.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair. So
I, so I guess there's, there's
nothing clear saying what we do
in that situation or any situ I
mean this is literally every
single situation, I would say.
A lost service animal that we
cannot find, we return it to the
owner, or is there some kind of
protocol to ensure that that
animal is safe before being
given back to the.
So I mean, that would pretty
much be in every single
instance, because this is
pertaining to
Searching for a lost service
animal. So I guess, I guess I
would just say maybe, maybe be a
little more specific with that.
I find.
It's to be important, especially
we don't want to be giving a dog
that may have gotten sick or
some other kind of malady that
could have
And put on that dog or that
horse and
During the time that we're
finding it. I just want to make
sure that we
We make sure that that animal is
protected. So I guess that
that's that point. I would just
leave that with you.
Your
OK, so the search and rescue
party, Madam Chair
Representative.
Is there any kind of definite
amount of people or time that is
given for an initial search, uh,
I mean, could you just go
through it for me? Uh, what is
the search and rescue party look
like for a dog rather than a
human. Because I mean a dog and
a human, they're they're
different, another they're
prioritized in different ways in
this bill. Could you tell me how
that would go, Madam Chair, and
representatives, this doesn't
cover how the rescue of a person
is if you.
Want to go into the details of
how an animal is rescued, um, I
don't think that is appropriate
for this spill either. This is
just asking um rescue to in an
emergency to first go and um
spend
Extra efforts to find a service
animal. Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. I'll bring you
back to page.
4
Lines 5 to 7, which are
underlined new text.
And this says
To the extent practical,
practicable, and while
prioritizing human safety and
security shall make a reasonable
effort to search for the
qualified service animal. So I'm
just asking.
What the search looks like.
For the human, which is right
there prioritizing human safety
versus for the animal, Madam
Chair.
What does that
look
are at that time.
It's not, it's a fact-specific.
Question you're asking and the
bill certainly does, uh, every
possible factual scenario, nor
does any uh
legislation. OK, thank you,
Madam Chair Representative. And
is there any kind of rulemaking
that
That they're
That is in place to
Guide these kinds of
Search and rescue missions,
Madam Chair Representative.
Man chair representative uh
would be if there was
rulemaking.
Um
Presumably that would be
Done by the uh.
Organizations that are
That would, that would be up to
them.
OK, thank you so much, Madam
Chair, Representative. OK. I
guess I just
I just want to make sure these
folks are protected legally,
right? And I just don't want any
kind of litigation ensue. So,
uh, Madam Chair Representative,
do we, do we expect any kinds of
Incurred costs.
To the counties or the
municipalities regarding this
change in the statute.
Madam Chair, Representative,
according to the analysis done.
Uh, there's no expected.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative.
OK. And then regarding the
state, is there any, any costs
that we're, we're looking for.
In state funds that might need
to be expended for this change.
according to the analysis that I
think there's no cost
anticipated.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. I'm just
looking.
At the analysis right now. Let
me, Madam Chair Representative,
so I guess on the analysis
regarding the training, I I know
we said it would be per case.
But I do see here on the
Governor's commission on
disability. They say that they
want to be consulted on creating
any training needed help first
responders learn how to best
reunite the qualified service
animal with its owner. So I
guess my question previously was
to make sure that there is some
kind of clarity. And I think
that it would be.
A good idea to get with the
commission and see.
What ideas they have when it
comes to consulting training
needed for these first
responders.
That they could indeed include
those.
When they do happen, because I
know we say it's case specific,
it's case-specific. It depends,
it depends. And I know it
depends, but I do want to make
sure that there are some kind of
guidelines so that if they do
have a lawsuit in the future,
that they at least have some
kind of framework. I think
maybe, maybe consulting with the
governor's commission on
disability on that, make sure
that there are training tools
that are
Well vetted, things that are
best practices that could
certainly be.
Something worth looking at. Have
you, have, have they been?
Spoken to in a drafting of this
legislation, the commission on.
Madam Chair Representative, uh,
No, but as Mr. Jim Jack.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair, and
I didn't, I don't know if he's
on the commission or not. So I,
I just would say,
It would definitely be something
worth asking.
And then Madam Chair Reps
representative, I know on the
Governor's Commission on
Disability.
Analysis, it does say GPS colors
would be encouraged to help
locate service animals during
emergencies. I, I guess maybe
consider that as well. I don't
know what that might look like,
but
GCD
At that in their analysis, um,
Madam Chair Representative.
They also said they want a a
statewide training program for
responders on animal recovery
that could.
Help as well. And I, I would
certainly
want that as well to be
considered. How does this align
with the ADA, Madam Chair,
Representative.
Uh, Madam Chair representative,
I didn't, what was the question?
How does your bill align with
the ADA.
The Americans with Disabilities
Act.
Madam Chair Representative, um.
This is
Regarding service uh covered in
the ADA. Thank you, Madam Chair.
OK. I just was wondering because
You know, the ADA is what, 50
years old now?
1970.
Pretty old, but it's not that
old. So, OK, I just, I wanted to
make sure that we're at least
following federal guidelines.
Are there any federal guidelines
regarding service animals, and
the search and rescue. I know
they probably have some
regarding federal land, so
You know that, Madam Chair
Representative, Madam Chair
Representative.
Could you point me to the page,
Madam Chair?
And which analysis are you
looking at? I just have the fur
in front of me. I could pull up
the agency analysis.
Madam Chair Representative of
I would assume.
Madam Chair, I absolutely did,
but this is your bill. So I
I want to make sure that we know
what we're looking at. So if you
would please help me.
Miss
I'm sorry, you're, you're going
to have to point her in the
direction that you're talking
about.
OK, Madam Chair, I'm just, I'm
just asking.
If this mirrors federal
regulations and statutes, and I
was told there were they were in
the analysis, but I'm just
trying to find where that may
be. So if you could just help
me, help direct me to that,
madam,
you just changed the question.
Um, I didn't, there was no
testimony that this mirrored
anything.
Uh, there was only a comment
that in the
Analysis, there was some
reference to some federal law.
OK, Madam Chair Representative,
we don't know what specific
guidelines.
There are in federal law. Is
that what I'm understanding? I
just want to make sure that if
we are putting something
forward, and it inflicts with
federal law that we're
addressing that.
I guess then the next question I
would ask is, do you think this
conflicts with any kind of
federal statute or regulation.
Madam Chair.
OK, great.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative. That helps
as well. So,
I'm getting a note from somebody
who's listening to the Zoom and
they say that service animals
are included in the ADA, but
they have no guidelines for
search and rescue. That, that
just isn't important.
Distinction I think is
Something we need to look at.
So,
Madam Chair, Representative.
I think Representative Lord
covered, you know, in instances
where someone may try to exploit
this bill to
Falsely claimed their service
animal.
was a service animal, if it
wasn't, and I think that's
important. And I think it's also
important to to give a
distinction to, to.
All kinds of animal owners.
Who may have emotional support
as well as
Comfort animals and therapy
animals, because I know
sometimes, at least I, I used to
work in the restaurant industry.
And in that industry, we had a
lot of people who said, oh, it's
a service dog, and then later
on, we figured out it wasn't a
service dog, it was actually
It was someone, someone's
emotional support dog, for
example. So I think maybe just
more clarity on that, maybe some
more education on that for
animals and I know folks who do
have qualified service animals,
they, they are well, very well
versed in all these statutes,
and they know what the protocols
are. But I do think for folks
who don't, that might be
something necessary to look at.
So, so thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, and I, I appreciate
the time. I, I wish there wasn't
as much extraordinary hostility
in the audience and on the
committee, but I think asking
questions about legislation.
is our job and we should not
scoff at that. Thank you,
manager.
Representative Romero.
Mount Cherubova do pass.
It's been a motion has been made
for due pass by Representative
Romero and seconded by uh
It's been a motion has been made
for due pass by Representative
Romero and seconded by a
representative, uh, Rubio.
Rubio
Is there any um
opposition
OK. Um,
With that, will you have a pass.
On how Bill 111 with uh and vote
of 6 to 0.
Thank you very much, uh, man.
OK, we're going to go back in
our um regular order.
And thank you Rose for being
here.
Um, and we will go with House
Bill 153 protect reporters from
exploitative, exploitative.
Representativesil but whenever
you're ready. Madam Chair and
committee, um, I just want to
make sure my expert witness.
What is your expert's name? Uh,
Kip Purcell. Are you on Zoom?
Bring him on.
He should be there.
Go ahead. Great. Thank you,
Madam Chair and committee. Uh,
so I'm here to present House
Bill 153, which seeks to repeal
the existing press shield law
and replace it with a new
section entitled the protect
reporters from exploitative
state Spying Act.
It updates and strengthens
protections for journalists and
mediums of communication by
defining journalists and mediums
of communication in ways that
journalism is done today.
I'll briefly review the
sections, um, and also include
that there's amendments that we
submitted yesterday.
Section 2 provides all new
definitions that look to update
the law.
Section 3 provides for limits on
compelled disclosure.
From cover journalists, which
prohibits a state entity from
compelling a covered journalist
to disclose protected
information unless a court in
the judicial district in which
the subpoena or other
compulsory.
Process is or will be issued,
determined by a preponderance of
the evidence after notice and
hearing that the disclosure is
necessary to prevent or identify
a perpetrator of an act of
terrorism or prevent the threat
of imminent violence significant
bodily harm or death.
Section 4 provides additional
limits on compelled disclosure
from covered service providers.
And section 5 limits the content
of information compelled to not
be overboard.
Unreasonable, overbroad, excuse
me, unreasonable or oppressive
and shall be limited to the
purpose of verifying or
determining the accuracy of
published information.
And finally, section section 6
prevents this law from being
construed to prevent the state
from pursuing an investigation
of a covered journalist or
organization that is sus
suspected of a committing a
crime, B a witness to a crime
unrelated to engaging in
journalism.
See, being an agent of a foreign
power.
an individual or organization
designated under executive order
13224.
Or if a terrorist organization,
as that term is defined in
section 212 of the Federal
Immigration and Nationality Act.
Um
I also submitted amendments to
the committee yesterday.
Um, and so I.
I'm wondering if Madam Chair can
get me. Um, yes, the committee
will pass out the amendment.
And
Madam chair, I'd like to move
the amendment to House Bill 153
for discussion.
Um, so for discussion.
If you would like to explain
your amendments.
Yes, Madam Chair and committee,
so, um, I and along with my
expert witness, Kip Purcell, who
is the um expert lawyer and
attorney on press shield laws in
New Mexico, um.
We met with the administrative
office of the courts and the
Supreme Court general counsel to
get their feedback on this bill
and um, they provided some
really great um feedback and
amendments that would clean up
some of the language of the
bill, um, so that they were
clear about, um, their
responsibilities or uh not
responsibilities, and then also,
um, adding, um, explicitly
including the legislative branch
of the state.
And
OK. Thank you. Is there any
discussion?
On, on the amendment.
Representative Lord.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative.
And it's always hard when we get
amendments in the first place
because now I gotta go.
ask you what they all mean and
how it applies to the bill.
So you have on page.
3
Line
12 after the first occurrence of
the insert legislation.
Legislative or branch.
In certain of the state. Can you
just briefly explain to me how
that changes this bill.
Madam Chair, Representative
Lord, it uh explicitly includes
the legislative branch as a
state entity.
And share ribs and I'll ask you
more questions on this later
when we get to the bill's party,
but I want to. Um,
So, uh, number 2 on page 3.
Line 19.
Strike is an insert.
Has been, what is the reason for
that change there, Madam chair.
Madam Chair Representative Lord,
that, um.
That amendment is.
To ensure that, um.
A subpoena has actually been
issued.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
I'm writing that down. Hold on.
Um, on
Page 3, line 20, we're striking
or will be, how does that affect
that section? Charisson.
Madam Chair Representative, um,
also.
Um
To clarify that a subpoena is or
has been issued.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
OK, Madam Chairman
representative on page 4.
Line 15.
Oh sorry, line 17, uh strike
unless insert if.
And after is inert not, how does
that affect that portion of the
bill.
Madam Chair, Representative,
also want to come back to item
4, there's 2 items on page 4,
you were going to that 115.
Yeah, miniature you can address
both of those, uh, number 4 and
number 5.
Again, line 4, or excuse me,
page 4 line 15, uh, striking is
or will be an inserting has been
also uh refers to subpoenas that
have been issued.
And then on page 4, line 17.
Uh, striking unless.
And inserting if.
Um, so again, um.
Instead of.
um,
If
Uh, is
Um, is not provided. So, um,
that said that just clarifies
again that um.
The unless there's imminent
violence that the testimony, um,
or documents provided, um.
Then um require compelling
disclosure.
Madam Chairman Representative on
the page 6, line 5, strike the
content of an insert.
A subpoena for. Can you explain
how that changed that?
Uh, Madam Chair, uh,
representative, again, just
being very specific to subpoena.
Madam Chair, Representative #7
on page 69 6 strike that is
insert in lieu of sought to be.
How does that change?
This
6
That's number 7.
Um, again, um, in reference to a
subpoena that has been sought.
And the information that is
sought within that subpoena.
OK, and Madam,
the last one on page 6, line 8.
After act, insert.
And the extent of any
information ordered to be
disclosed in proceedings to
enforce such a subpoena.
It's a big change to.
Yes, Madam Chair Representative,
um, that is to clarify the role
of a judge, um, if a subpoena
were to come in front of a judge
and kept, correct me if I'm
wrong on that one.
Right, madam. Am I audible? Yes.
Thank you and thank you, uh,
Madam Chair, and the committee
for letting me uh appear this
way, uh, the, the, the, the
changes that we've just been
discussing were at the
suggestion of the administrative
office of the courts. They
pointed out that the bill as
originally drafted, talked
about, um, overbroad or
unreasonable testimony, which
they thought was an odd way of
putting it, and
allowed the bill as as currently
drafted makes clear that uh what
uh what is unreasonable, uh, or
oppressive is the request for
testimony or the extent of the
domes the testimony compelled,
um, and, and it just makes it a
little more clear.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
representative. That's all the
questions I had. Thank you,
expert.
And I'm sure I moved uh that we
adopt the amendment.
Is there any opposition to the
adoption of the amendment.
OK, seeing none, you haven't
amended.
Um, House Bill 111, um.
Now we will go to.
Um
Um, thank you. Um, we'll go to
the audience. Is there any
opposition?
OK.
I'm sorry, that was the last
bill, 16.
153, yeah.
OK, is there any opposition to
House Bill 153?
OK, is there anyone on Zoom, OK.
Then we'll go to those in
support of House Bill 150.
There's 2 or 3 if you'll just
take the mic to the people.
And if you'll keep it member of
the committee, my name is Brian
Fennell. I'm with the
Albuquerque Journal and
Albuquerque Publishing Company.
Um, we face this type of
situation repeatedly, and this
bill will certainly help protect
confidential informants and
freedom of the press, and on
behalf of the journal or
community newspapers and all the
papers in the state that are
members of the New Mexico Press
Association. We clearly and
definitely support this bill.
Thank you.
Thank you. Next.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee and
thank you, Representative. This
is Kristen Love with the ACLU of
New Mexico. I just want to
applaud, um, the sponsor of the
bill for
Moving to protect journalists
during this time when techno
technological overreach and
government overreach are
intruding on press freedom. So
thank you very much.
Thank you.
Um, was there share?
Sharon Arjun Bright, thank you,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee. I'd like to ditto.
What the uh lawyer just said.
We need this now more than ever,
with AI fake news.
And some protection. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you. Is there
anyone else in the audience?
Oh
All right, is there anyone on
Zoom?
OK. Patrick Dorsey.
And Mr. Dorsey to one minute
please.
Uh, yeah, Patrick Dorsey,
publisher of the Santa Fe, New
Mexican. I also represent uh the
board of the New Mexico Press
Association and the Tas News,
and I would just wave and
support, uh, with Brian
Fantel's, uh, testimony is very
important uh to newspapers and
media operations all over the
state, and we strongly support
this bill. Thank you.
Thank you. Next.
And
Oh, that's it. OK.
All right. Thank you. Is there
anything else you'd like to add?
Represented
Madam Chair, no, thank you open
up for questions.
OK, thank you, um,
Representative Block.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative and uh
good to see you off the floor,
so.
Thank you for being here with
us, Bill.
Madam Chair, Representative.
I guess I'm just gonna start
just going through what
What these covered journalists
are.
They kind of want a better
picture of what who who's
actually included in this. So,
I think it says someone who
regularly
Engages in journalistic
activities.
And regular employees kind of
periodic.
What if, what if they engage
irregularly, but they still
consider themselves a
journalist. Uh, can you just
tell me a little bit about that,
Madam Chair, and Representative
Silva.
Madam Chair, Representative B
block, uh, yes, so.
This actually this definition is
exactly what we intended, uh,
the current statute protected
all people, uh, doing journalism
at the time it was written, not
just investigative reporters,
uh, it would have and still does
include people like sports
reporters, movie reviewers,
travel writers who work for an
organization like a newspaper,
um, that's because any
journalist can at times
encounter the need to interact
with and potentially quote
sources who need anonymity, um,
but have information that is
critical to.
They're reporting.
And um, so we are explicitly
seeking to update the statute to
include everyone who does
journalism today, uh,
absolutely, including people who
publish their work on social
media or blogs, uh, they just
like sports features or
investigative reporters uh need
the same protection that news
and investigative reporters
required to do their jobs.
Thank you, Chair.
OK, thank you so much, Madam
Chair. Thank you,
Representative. OK, that, that
helps me a little bit. So it
kind of includes
So I have a buddy who he's got
like a Twitter account.
It's not technically a website
or a
Printed periodical, but it's
just.
Twitter updates.
And I think on Twitter or X
rather, sorry, sorry, Elon. It's
X. So he
Oh sun
X, different.
Threads, I guess you'd call it,
and they're, I guess he, he
considers them newsworthy.
With that technically be
included because I know X is.
According to the App Store,
which I don't know if you
believe it or not, but the app
store, it says X is the largest
media company.
In the world. So,
Would an individual user on X
who who is intending to.
newsworthy content.
Would they be included in this,
or does it?
have to specifically be somebody
who's a journalist, columnist,
etc. Madam Chair,
representative.
Thank you, Madam Chair and uh
Representative Block.
Um
I think
One and then I'll I'll open up
to to respond to this to, um,
that are definition of.
Covered journalists and
journalism is broad, and that's
deliberate, uh, the definitions
are intentionally expansive to
avoid arguments about bias
towards mainstream media, um,
but also to protect citizen
journalists and steer clear of
covering only professionals, um,
and to allow for future forms of
journalism that have yet to be
imagined.
Um, and it would cover, uh, it
could cover social media
influencers and bloggers
provided that uh they ply their
trade regularly, so not the one
off one time, um, post here and
there, and of course it has no
application to influencers or
bloggers who have no
confidential sources, uh,
influencers and bloggers who
merely pluck things from the
Internet or from popular culture
and comment on them, get no
benefit from the shield law, uh,
and I'd open it.
for my expert witness, uh, if
you have anything to add, Mr.
Purcell.
Yes, Representative, I would
just add that the existing
statute, and we don't have to
get into detail about why this,
the statute uh has certain
constitutional problems at this
point, but the old statute, but
the existing statute is limited
to journalists, uh, who for
gain, in other words, paid
journalists, uh, right, etc. And
um and the Supreme Court rule
which
turns
Um, which governs court
proceedings, uh, also suggests
that uh the covered persons need
to be employed in, in some way
as journalists. This definition,
uh,
Yeah, allows for protection of
amateur journalists. It does
require, however, a seriousness
of purpose and, and that's the
point of the word regularly. Uh,
it's, it's not, uh, the, the
weekend blogger, uh, it is
someone who does this very often
and in, in fact, all the time,
um, in order to disseminate
information to the public. Uh,
and, and
That's the, that's really the
only limitation, but it is a
very broad definition of
journalists.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative and
Mr. Purcell that, OK, that does
help me. So I guess my buddy who
if if it's a regular, let's just
say every other day.
Maybe every week.
At least it's in some kind of
rhythm where it's not just
really long periods of time.
But that, that would still be
considered regular, or does it
have to be kind of
Like an every day kind of thing.
I just want to make sure that
regular is not too much of a
Of a constrictive word or too
much of a broad word. I want to
make sure that folks.
are protected if they come back
into the profession, for
example, after a few years and
they just do one column, a
one-off column that does have
these confidential sources. I
just want to make sure those
folks would be in here. Would
they be, Madam Chair and
Representative and Mr. Purcell.
Madam Chair, Representative, um,
I think, uh, again, to echo Mr.
Purcell, it, it's not just time,
um, that we're measuring here as
regular but seriousness of
purpose, and, um, and so I would
include that as a measurement,
um, and so, um, much of.
Like the work that you do online
would also be included in this
hip, do you have anything else
that you would wanna add? Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Uh, yes, Madam Chair and
Representative, uh, I, I would
just say that um of, of course,
not all journalists work in
daily publications. Many
journalists, uh, work, uh, uh,
at weeklies and of course, they
would be covered and um
similarly, people who uh blog at
regular intervals, I think,
would be covered by this, of
course, it is going to require
some fleshing out by the courts.
Over time, the bill itself does
not
Uh, undertake to define
regularly precisely.
OK. And thank you, Madam Chair
and thank you, Representative,
and thank you for that. You
know, I do think that's
important to not.
To
strict, I guess the word would
be. So that helps me. So
continuing here.
Madam Chair and Representative.
Personal technology device.
This is on page 2.
A covered journalist, says
handheld communication device,
laptop.
Desktop computer, other internet
connected device.
Madam Chair Representative, I
mean, I.
Actually do have a buddy who's
kind of a
I don't know if the word would
be like a.
It's not very mainstream, right?
So he uses
Mostly
Just like a typewriter. He's
like that kind of, he's cool,
right? So I know they're coming
back. And then he sends it to
somebody and then they, they
post it for him. So Madam Chair
Representative, since he's
using, he's following people on
the phone and stuff.
And he's getting letters in the
mail, things like that. Would
that be included in this.
devices category, because, I
mean, he's not technically.
Using any kind of handheld
communications devices. He's
more of a uh
Very original journalists, you
could say. Would that be
something that's been considered
here and how is he protected in
this statute, Madam Chair.
Madam Chair, Representative, uh,
thank you for the question. So
this updates definitions of
mediums of communication to
include electronic uh devices
and um those sorts of modes of
communication, um, if you look
at page 3, line 5, section G,
protected information means any
information identifying a source
who provided information, um.
As part of engaging in
journalism and any records,
contents of communication,
documents or information that
covered journalists obtained or
created as part of engaging in
journalism. That section would
cover uh the the uh modes of
communication you describe.
Thank you, madam.
OK. Thank you so much, Madam
Chair Representative, and I'm
I'm glad that that's covered in
there.
My next question is regarding
the actual tech companies that
own these.
These platforms. So I know that
there's a
Skipping my mind. I was thinking
about it today. One of these
kind of things where you could
put something up there. Will
these tech companies be the ones
deciding which users count as
covered journalists, or who
decides?
That they, could they have to
start
A new kind of
If it's if it was X, for
example, could they have to do a
new check mark that says, oh,
this person's a journalist.
They're covered or or what what
role do those tech companies
play in the administration of
this, Madam Chair,
representative.
Madam Chair Representatives,
they do not because this is a
state, this would be a state
statute.
Thank you, Madam. OK, thank you,
Madam Chair Representative. So
you said it was a state statute,
so.
I mean, I know we have, we have
laws here that kind of determine
things in the state.
Like I know some states are
Or banning certain content and
they're just leaving states
because of that kind of content,
etc. So I just want to make sure
that they don't feel as though
they are needing to be the
proprietors of who's a
journalist, who's not a
journalist. So you're saying
that they, they would not, it
would just be within the purview
of the individual journalist.
To include themselves as that
protected class, Madam Chair,
represent.
Madam Chair, Representative, uh,
the statute defines journalists
as New Mexico defines it not as
the journalists themselves or
another outside entity,
including a corporation.
OK, thank you so much, Madam
Chair and Representative. OK,
that helps a little bit on that.
And I'm still on page 3.
I know we added the word
legislative.
Or
Executive branch.
And I, I think it was asked and
I, I didn't catch it. So,
Madam Chair Representative.
Why did we add that legislative
or.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair
Representative, uh, this came
at, um.
This came through some feedback
that we received that state
entity wasn't completely
explicit to explain that this
also included the legislative
branch, um, that was the
original intent of uh this of HB
153 was to include the executive
and the legislative, so we
wanted to make that um much more
specific.
Thank you, Ma.
Perfect. OK. Thank you so much
and I appreciate that
clarification that, that does
help me a lot. So,
All right, so Madam Chair
Representative.
We're talking about the, the
mediums that they use and how
they use them. Is there some
kind of stipulation in here
where they, they must keep those
records.
In a specific
Fashion
When it comes to discovery, for
example, in a legal case, Madam
Chair.
Madam Chair Representative, no,
it does not.
OK, thank you so much, Madam
Chair and representative. And so
next year in section 3, we're
talking about limits on
compelled disclosure.
So
And I'm your representative. So
if they
I'm understanding it correctly.
If there's a subpoena for
something, let's just say
someone is
Let's just say it's me. Let's
just say there was a journalist
online who said something that I
didn't like. I thought it was
actionable.
It took it to court.
In the discovery process.
What would be able to be
disclosed with the current
changes in the law?
if that did happen, and how
would I ensure that those were
indeed turned over to me if I
needed that in discovery, Madam
Chair.
Madam Chair, Representative
Block, this, um, bill does not
address a libel or defamation of
a person.
OK, madam chair, representative.
So I guess maybe not just not
liable or any kind of defamation
because libel and defamation are
very like, it's targeted toward
my, my character and my
personality, me as an
individual, it's making my name.
Out to be something it's not.
But maybe what if it was a
correction that I was looking
for.
And it wasn't me. Let's just say
they, they had the wrong.
The wrong information about a
specific date that something
happened or specific instances
and it was an undisclosed
source.
How would that work with this
statute, Madam Chair,
Representative Silva.
Um, Madam Chair, Representative,
uh, thank you. So again, this
bill is is not about libel or
defamation, there are laws that
protect the public from reckless
or harmful actions by
journalists. Um, this is a bill
that enables journalists to do
their jobs according to the
ethics of their profession by
protecting their ability to
protect their confidential
sources, notes and
communications, and so these are
separate issues, um, and and
separate statutes, um, that
protect the public.
defamatory acts by journalists.
Um, I want to continue though
and say that limits on compelled
disclosure means that.
And if a journalist is, uh,
subpoenaed for particular
information that subpoena cannot
say we want all your notes from,
um, the last 60 days regardless
of issue person you interviewed
or topic, um, and so, uh,
section 3 looks at what are the
limits on what.
A court can compel a journalist
to disclose.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and then
uh also Mr. Purcell, if there's
anything you'd like to add.
Yes, thank you, Representative,
uh, Madam Chair and
Representative, um, this bill
does not address what a court
can compel in litigation that's
ongoing before it. That's a very
deliberate design of the bill
because in a 1976 case called
Ammerman versus Hubbard
Broadcasting Company, the
Supreme Court declared that the
then existing press shield.
law, which is still on the
books.
Um, could not constitutionally
be applied to the judiciary.
That's why this bill defines
state entity as a uh a body of
the legislative or executive
branch or an administrative uh
body and uh that's why this bill
is limited to telling those
bodies what they can and can't
subpoena and the circumstances
under which they can, but
litigation, including libel and
death.
information
and, and other kinds of tort
claims, um, are not affected by
this bill.
OK. And thank you, Madam Chair
and thank you, Representative
and Mr. Purcell, you actually
answered one of my next
questions, which was about that,
that very case, so that does
help me. And so, Madam Chair
Representative, when it comes to
the
The actual case, the legal case.
I believe from, from something I
read in one of the analyses, and
I'm sorry, uh.
It says how does HB 153 allow
judges to order disclosure, but
only for terrorism or violence,
but not other serious crimes.
Could you tell me a little bit
about that, Madam Chair.
Thank you. Thank you, Madam
Chair, uh, and Representative
Block.
Uh, so we, um,
Cover
We cover on.
Section 6,
what.
Prevents the law from being
construed to prevent the state
from pursuing an investigation
of a covered journalist, so
that's one like if a journalist
commits a crime, this law
doesn't apply, um, and we're
also looking at, uh, like clear
and present danger to someone
that um without the testimony or
disclosure from a journalist,
uh, would cause great bodily
harm or injury.
Um, Mr. Purcell, anything you'd
like to add?
No, I don't, I don't believe so,
Representative. Thank you.
Perfect. Thank you so much, uh,
Madam Chair and Representative.
So then,
I guess I'm trying to, I, I'm
trying to kind of understand.
The main purpose of the bill.
Right? And so with this, give
any additional rights.
That were, I guess, more
protection.
than the First Amendment to
journalists, Madam Chair and
representative.
Uh, Madam Chair Representative,
uh, no, they would not, so, um,
this is again to protect the uh
the ability for journalists to
do their jobs and to ensure
that, um.
That they're not under threat of
uh civil subpoena or trying to
investigate um different issues
in the state of New Mexico, um,
Mr. Purcell, can I hand that
over to you as well?
Yes, Representative, thank you.
And as a lawyer uh
representative and, and Madame
Chair, I, I, uh, I do need to,
uh, disagree a little bit with
representative, um, it, it does
provide more protection as all
press shield laws do, then the
First Amendment because the US
Supreme Court decided in 1972
that the First Amendment does
not require a press shield laws,
but in that case,
The Supreme Court invited state
legislatures to create press
shield laws to enhance First
Amendment rights and uh more
than 40 states have done that
since and New Mexico is one of
those cities.
I stand corrected, Madam Chair
and representative. Thank you,
Kip.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, Representative, and,
and I'm not an attorney either,
so I would not have known that.
So thank you, Mr. Purcell, Madam
Chair. Uh, next year,
I, do we have any case law in
the state of New Mexico.
Regarding this specific instance
in the.
Compelling
Of production or producing any
kind of a privileged sources,
etc.
I'm going to hand this over to
Mr. Purcell as well, um, but
first I will say that there are
over 54 state entities.
Agencies, boards, commissions
and secretaries that have
subpoena power in the state of
New Mexico that are outside of
the judicial branch.
Mr. Purcell.
Thank you, Representative, uh,
Madam Chair and Representative,
there really isn't a very well
developed body of case law under
the existing press shield.
Authorities, the, the
authorities being the statute
that was passed in 1973, um, and
it's been declared partially
unconstitutional by the Supreme
Court in Anterman and the
Supreme Court's own rule of
evidence, uh, and, uh, instead
they're these cases have tended
to be decided at the trial court
level and not appealed in any
way that results in a
Published decision. So there
really isn't a good
body of common law under these
rules and statutes that we can
draw on.
In this state.
OK, got you. Thank you so much,
Madam Chair, Representative.
OK, I just was making sure that
there wasn't anything that was
currently pending that this was
kind of an emergency clause
situation, you know,
Madam Chair, and um.
I think this is the, the best
time to do it as well, because
it it isn't there isn't a state
emergency where, um, we, we must
do these things, uh, I think
that is what we want to prevent.
And so, uh, this is a
preventative, uh, statute that
updates definitions of
journalism and uh journalists,
so that we don't have to test
whether a state agency, um,
would or could go after uh a
journalist. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
OK, great. Thank you so much,
Madam Chair. Representative, and
I guess I, I just have one
question on this point regarding
The uh
He's the SEC their analysis.
The ethics commission, they say.
Something to do with issues and
the separation of powers, they
say.
That
could violate the separation of
powers by dictating court
procedures. Could you just
address that concern from the
SEC.
Sure, I think uh the ethics
commission, um.
Actually agrees that this would
not conflict, um, they're
referring to the Emmerman case
that, um, Mr. Purcell has
brought up, and again, we've um
spoken regularly with the state
Supreme Court on to address um
their uh concerns about whether
this would violate, um.
The, uh, separation of powers,
Mr. Purcell, would you want to
add any Thank you Madam Chair
and Representative, uh, I, I
would just say that the bill
does refer to the courts in
several places, but the purpose
of the bill is to lay down the
rules by which the executive and
Legislative branches can compel
subpoena and documents. And to
the extent that the bill
Enlists the courts in those
efforts and asks the courts to
apply those rules and those
standards to those branches, it
does not.
Create any constitutional
problems. And again, this bill
does not affect
Court proceedings, litigation,
classic litigation as we know
it, only administrative
proceedings, it is only when
A uh an executive or legislative
branch.
Body, once it's subpoenaed and
enforced.
Um, that it goes to court and
then it, it is constitutional,
we believe, to ask the court to
in those kinds of administrative
and legislative situations to
enforce the rules that the
legislature has laid down for
itself and for the executive
branch.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair,
Representative. I appreciate
that. That helps me.
Regarding that. So, I, I guess
it sounds to me like the 40
states I believe is that we said
there hasn't been any
significant litigation that's
chopped away at these, these.
statute.
I just want to make sure that
what we're doing, it won't make
the state have to be
into court for years and years.
So, could you just tell me a
little bit about the 40 states
and how they all held up to
legal muster, Madam Chair.
Uh, representative.
Um, we need to, you know, keep
things going cause we have, you
know.
Quite a few more bills to go and
um representative if you and
your expert could keep um
answers as concise as possible.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative, uh, we have not
done studies of the other 40
states, we just know that ours
in New Mexico, uh, is, um,
is, is weak. OK. Thank you so
much, Madam Chair Representative
that, that's helpful. So,
Regarding current whistleblower
protections, how does this
enhance them or
How does this change them, Madam
Chair and Representative?
Um, Madam Chair, representative
of this does not speak to a
whistleblower.
OK. Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative. And then I
guess, are there any
I mean, I, I would hate to ask
the sponsor of a bill, if
there's loopholes in the bill.
But that's the way I kind of
look at legislation. I look from
the other side to make sure that
you cannot in turn use this in
another way that could hurt. So,
Could state agencies exploit
loopholes in HB 153 to obtain
journalist data through
alternative means.
Madam Chair.
I'm gonna leave that to Mr.
Purcell.
Uh, representative, not, not
other than through the standards
that are uh set forth in the
bill is, is, in our opinion.
OK, thank you so much, Madam
Chair and Representative. And
then I guess I'm just going to
go back to the
the beginning of the questions
here. We were talking about the
content and what they actually
put forward content wise. So how
does HB 153 provide protections
against.
Fake news sites claiming
journalistic status. So, yeah,
they they post regularly. It
could be newsworthy, but they
could be giving out
misinformation. How are we
helping address that issue with
this legislation, are they
protected in this, Madam Chair,
Representative.
Uh, Madam Chair Representative,
this bill does not address um
nor create any um statute for.
Um, misinformation or um quote
fake news, um, again, it, it
protects, uh.
Journalists and defines them as
journalism is done today,
including their communications,
the mediums of communication.
OK. Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative. So then, what
penalties exist for journalists
who abuse the privileges under
HB 153.
Are there any kind of
Legal ramifications.
If used incorrectly.
Um, Madam Chair, uh,
representative, I am unclear on
how a journalist might abuse.
Uh, this, uh, this statue.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair. I
guess, yeah, I just want to make
sure that this is super tight,
right? We want the legislation
to be super correct, ready to
go. So.
That, that does help a little
bit. I do have some questions
regarding false whistleblower
claims and things of that
nature.
Such as if it's a false
whistleblower claim that a
journalist takes as legitimate.
Right, and they go with the
story, they, they check a
source, they check another
source and it ends up not being
correct. I just want to make
sure that that journalist, if it
did indeed come out incorrect.
is protected through this.
And so, could you just give me a
little bit of information about
that and how they would be
protected in the instance that
they, it wasn't them who was
knowingly distributing false
information, but it was their
source that was incorrect, Madam
Chair.
Madam Chair, Representative,
again, this is uh not a bill
about libel and defamation, so,
um, so those are, these are
separate issues and we have laws
on the books to protect the
public, uh, from defamatory
acts, um, by journalists, um, or
journalists to other
journalists, uh, and so, um.
Again, this uh this bill enables
journalists to do their jobs
according to the ethics of
their.
Their profession, um, by
protecting their ability to
protect their confidential
sources, notes and
communications. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Perfect. OK, thank you so much,
Madam Chair and Representative.
And so just so I'm understanding
correctly, the how the
legislation works, so.
This, this bill would require
judicial approval before a
journalist.
Service provider.
Like Google or AT&T could be
compelled to hand over the data.
Is that
Am I reading that correctly,
Madam Chair, Representative?
Um, Mr. Purcell, can, can you
help? Yes. Uh, I, I mean this
requires that data provider, um,
this requires the legislative or
executive branch that is trying
to get to compel the production
of information from that data
provider to go through the steps
that are uh listed in the bill.
It also requires except under
Specified circumstances that the
journalist himself or herself be
given notice and an opportunity
to be heard before the subpoena
is enforced by the court.
And Mr. Purcell, could you
please go through the chair.
And then the representative.
I apologize, Madam Chair.
No problem, just.
Thank you so much, Madam Cha. I
apologize for that. So, uh,
Madam Chair Representative, so
Lastly
The effective date is July 1st.
Do we
We see this as a reasonable date
for effectiveness on the, on the
statute. I mean, I don't know
who's gonna have to get into
compliance right with this? Have
we, have we talked about that
and
Is it a reasonable
deadline, Madam Chair, Madam
Chair Representative, um, all
the analysis from all the
agencies uh did not bring that
up as an issue, so I don't see
that as an issue. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Perfect. OK. Thank you so much,
Madam Chair Representative, and
I'm still on the fence on this.
I think it.
Sounds good. I think I'm gonna
listen to the rest of the debate
and see to what folks are saying
and I appreciate you bringing
this forward. I think that we do
need to protect journalism and
In this country, we definitely
want to make sure that folks are
Being able to
You exercise their First
Amendment, right? Right. I mean,
that's super American and this
would give.
Extra rights to, to journalists.
So I don't know about that. I
think that might be something.
That could be
turn off for some people, but I
do think that it's important at
least to protect the profession.
So, thanks, Madam Chair, I'll
leave it at that.
Thank you, Representative
Romero. Thank you, Madam Chair.
I'd like to move a do pass as
amended.
I
I'm sorry, we already have a
motion for due pass,
Madam Chair, every, every member
has, has the right to ask
questions on a bill
and Madam before a member of any
legislative body can reach
intelligent decisions. It's
necessary that they understand
the subject upon which they're
making decisions
to table and move bills and you
still allowed me to ask
questions on that. I had raised
one question, I'll let you go
ahead, but we have a motion.
I'm sorry, if it's, do you have
one question? I have multiple
questions. It's a very hefty
bill and how do you expect me to
make a decision for my
representatives. We're talking
about journalism and freedom of
speech. I have no freedom of
speech right now because I
cannot ask questions right now
if you want to when you explain
your vote, we have a motion,
then I will explain.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I'll
explain my vote for 20 minutes.
I'm sorry, you can't
you madam, you cannot cut off
cut off debate pursuant to
Mason's rules of plenty of time
excuse me,
do you want us to go into
recess? Yes, we do want to go.
We're not going into recess,
madam. I want to make sure that
members of this committee can
ask questions about legislation.
She had her hand raised before I
started asking questions.
Madam Chair, I have her on the
list. I thought that he had
added my name to we normally
work.
We ask questions we always ask
questions. I'm sorry we have a
motion on the floor, then it's
because I don't have my First
Amendment speech and don't have
my rights to ask questions about
a very lengthy bill that should
be subject to being taken apart
and asked questions about
because I'm being shut down and
the other day you allowed people
to say they either moved a table
or not and you'd still let us
ask questions. So I think this
complete violation of my rights.
Um, you're rights as a
representative.
are to follow order, we will let
you ask a few questions.
And then we will go back to the
motion.
Thank you, Madam Chair, I do
have some questions. I have a
lot. You're going to get a no
vote for me because if I don't
get to dissect a bell and ask
questions, there's no way I can
go back to my representative and
say, I don't know, I voted for a
bill I don't really know about,
so I will ask you a few
questions. There were some
concerns in here.
Madam Chair, uh, the Attorney
General disagrees with this
bill, conflicts with Rule 11514
and by legislating rules of
evidence. So can you explain to
me why the eternal general um
had these concerns and raises
concern about the broad
definition of journalism because
I was looking through here and
including a news article that
said, according to where your
bill is defined, that can also
include bloggers. So can you
explain to me why you believe
that the uh New Mexico Attorney
General disagrees with this
bill, and what is your counter
to the
amount of chair representative
experts.
Madam Chair Representative Lord,
um.
I saw that analysis as well from
the Attorney general, um, I
point out that the ethics
commission analysis explicitly
disagrees with that, um, and
that uh Charles K. Purcell, my
expert witness, and the state's
expert on the press shield law
and rule, uh, and the
complicated history have written
this bill carefully, uh, and
we've consulted with the Supreme
Court and the administrative
offices of the courts to get
their feedback on this as well.
And so, um, I respectfully
mention my other concern was the
way
You defined, uh, in your bill,
how you define what a journalist
is.
Um, some of the questions that
they had, including the New
Mexico Department of Justice
stated that they cautioned.
That because it doesn't create a
functional dis uh distinction
separating investigative
reporter from a social media
influencer or a hobbyist
blogger, and that would also
include like a TikTok
journalist, a social media
journalist, what is your
response to that because this is
one of my big issues as
normally, it would be more
definition of what somebody is
is in press and what a
journalist is and that we have a
very vague.
Description. Do you want to
address the um problem from the
state ethics commission, Madam
Chapresentative.
Madam Chair, Representative
Lord, I believe that we covered
that concern, um, Madam ribs and
it still doesn't really answer
that because I I know that
you're saying that they have to
do certain things in order, but
there's nothing in here that
says with the exclusion of a
TikTok influencer social media
influencer, so it's still,
according to the Department of
Justice a very.
vague reply, Madam Chair
Representative. I have a
question I'm sure in about IPRA.
So are you saying that?
If there was somebody who
Reported something.
To the journalist that there's
no ability to IPRA a journalist.
Is that my understanding, and
I'm sure representative.
Madam Chair Representative,
journalists are not covered by
the inspection of public records
Act as they're not part of a
state entity.
Thank you OK, Madam Chair, what
about somebody who's in the
media in the governor's office,
man chair representative.
And they be E.
Uh, Madam Chair, Representative,
yes, I believe that is my
understanding for, uh, anything
that has been made a public
record.
OK, Madam Chair, representative,
so there are a few different
other places in here that also
say that they have some
questions about.
Um, your definition of
journalism, I just have a few
more questions. I find this in
here. Sorry, I got thrown out of
order because I wanted to ask.
Questions on this very important
bill.
But I think what I will say it's
very frustrating that if I was a
Democrat, I would have been
allowed to go and ask the
questions, but because I'm not,
I'm not gonna be able to get
him, so I'm just gonna say that
I absolutely voting no on your
bill because I don't know enough
about it. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Thank you. We have a motion on
the floor. I moved a table.
Second.
Move the table, madam chair. We
will take a vote on the tabling
motion.
You take roll call.
Representative, the table.
Representative Lord, yes, to
table.
Representative Ramiro? No.
Representative Thompson? No.
Madam Vice Chair, not a table,
Madam Chair. No to table.
Um, the tabling motion has
failed on a vote of uh
Or against and 2 in favor.
Uh, we'll go back to the motion
for due pass on house Bill 153
and it was seconded.
As amended. Yes, thank you.
OK, yes.
OK. Seconded by Representative
Rubio. OK, we'll take roll call.
Representative Block.
No, and I'd like to explain my
vote. Representative Lord, no,
and I've explained my vote.
Representative Ramiro.
Representative Representative
Thompson, yes.
Madam Vice Chair, yes.
Madam Chair
Yes
So
Have a due pass uh on house
bill.
153 is amended on a vote of 4 in
favor, 2 against and represent a
block to explain his vote. Thank
you, Madam Chair. I
And it's a shame. I couldn't
support the legislation. I was
going to hear more questions and
concerns that I had in debate
and it's uh it's unfortunate
what happened today, but, but
that's why I'm a no. It doesn't
mean I'm a no on the floor. So
I'll continue to listen to the
debate and probably watch the
next committee and, and best of
luck in the committee and thank
you so much, Madam Chair, and
I'll see you on the floor. Thank
you.
Representative Lord to explain
your vote.
But I'm sure I think I really
did.
And um just like to remind our.
Committee members that if you
would like to speak to, please,
when there's debate going on to
make sure that we get you on the
list. Thank you.
Congratulations.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you committee. I appreciate it.
Thank you, Mr. Purcell. Madam
Chair, should we make her sing?
No, no, that's on the floor. I'm
just teasing her
I think.
This is your first bill just for
the audience to understand.
Thank you. Thank you. I'm.
Next we'll go to um
Representative Romero, House
Bill 169 public expression
Protection Act.
Whenever you're ready.
Thank you, Madam Chair. um,
thank you, members of the
committee today before you is um
the uniform public expression
Protection Act. This updates
laws from 2001, um, I'll note
presocial media, pre sort of.
21st century Internet situations
that help um us understand, um,
what's going on with public
expression, this piece of
legislation safeguards the
fundamental rights of free
speech, the press assembly
petition and association
guaranteed by both the US and
New Mexico Constitutions, um.
In an era that we are currently
in, where strategic lawsuits
against public participation.
AKA slaps, you'll hear, hear
anti-slap a lot, uh, happy to
talk about it, can silence um
individuals and organizations,
this act provides the essential
protections by allowing
defendants to quickly dismiss
meritless claims and recover
costs associated with defending
their rights. Um, we look
forward to uh discussing this
piece of legislation, what's in
the bill and entertain any
questions with me is my experts,
um, I'll let her introduce
herself. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. I'm Kristen
Greer Love and a senior so with
that, Madam Chair we'll stand
for questions.
Thank you. Um, is there anyone
in the audience that's in
opposition.
To, um, let me just remind
everybody we're on House Bill
169.
OK, seeing none. Is there anyone
on?
In opposition. We will go to the
audience now and those um who
are in support of this bill.
Raise your hand.
And if you'd like to speak.
You can
Uh, lined up.
Please, I guess that's easier
with so many people. If you can
make it to one minute, we'd
appreciate it.
That's not very much, but we
have a lot of good late
afternoon, Madam Chair and
committee members. I will tell
you that there were many more
people in support at 1:30, uh,
just a few of us left at, uh,
5:10, um, we're in support of
this bill. This is super
necessary at this time to um to
To protect First Amendment
rights.
About 35
Marielle Nanasi on behalf of New
Energy Economy, uh, 5000 member
organization. Thank you. I'm
sorry I didn't do that. Um.
They're about 35 states who,
that have some form of this bill
and about 10 that have this form
of this bill, and the last one
that was, um, adopted was in
Ohio, which was bipartisan, 100%
unanimous support Republicans
and Democrats in Ohio. For this
bill. So we're hoping that that
you will see that kind of
respect and and, um, fervor,
encouragement for the first.
First Amendment. Thank you so
much. We hope that everyone
supports and votes for this 169.
Thank you. Thank you. Next.
My name is Jeffrey Has. Uh, I've
been a civil rights and human
rights attorney for a long time,
Madam Chair and committee
members, uh, I don't think I
need to remind any of us, we
live in a very polarized
society. It's very important
that public discourse all that
people feel free to express
their ideas and work those ideas
out, whether it's in writing or
in journalism, so the purpose of
this bill is to allow that and
not to allow censorship of
different ideas.
is. Secondly, some feel that
this bill is really made to
deter frivolous lawsuits. People
might say, well, this is just
going to add more to the courts.
In fact, the idea is to prevent
frivolous lawsuits that people
with resources who sue not to
win but to cause damage to the
person sued, make them go
through discovery and
depositions. So this is to
protect those people exercising
their rights from frivolous
lawsuits.
Thank you. Thank you, Madam
Chairman, again, Brian Fennell
with the Albuquerque Journal and
Albuquerque Publishing Company
on behalf of the Journal of the
Publishing Company and our
community newspapers and the New
Mexico Press Association and
it's all its members, we support
this bill, um, in the interest
of free speech, thank you.
Thank you. Next.
Good evening, Madam Chair and
Representatives. My name is
Lavin Johnson. I represent the
Center for Biological Diversity.
Our ability to speak to our
government and on issues of
great public concern is critical
to the political health of our
state and country.
Currently, the rich and powerful
can weaponize our state courts
to suppress these essential
components of free speech, by
bringing meritless suits against
people who speak out.
Such suits seem to make examples
of vocal New Mexicans by
entangling them and exhausting,
expensive years-long litigation.
Even if ultimately dismissed,
these suits can ruin lives,
destroy organizations, and
prevent free speech through
intimidation.
SB sorry HB 169 would protect
our freedom of speech from these
abusive suits, and I urge you to
vote yes.
Thank you.
Thank you. Anyone else? OK,
we'll go to.
OK, if you can introduce them.
Sophia Jenkins.
You can keep it to one minute,
Miss Jenkins.
Yeah, hello, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Sophia Jenkins Nieto.
I'm speaking on behalf of Yucca
today. We're a statewide
youth-led Climate Justice
Organization, fighting for a
livable and just future for New
Mexico. We strongly support HB
169 as it presents an
opportunity to protect every New
Mexican's right to their First
Amendment right of freedom of
speech, assembly, and petition.
As youth advocates and
organizers, we are committed to
speaking out when the justice is
forced in our communities. Slop
suits weaponize
Our legal system against the
public. This form of litigation
intimidates communities and
individuals from speaking up.
This is a tool that corporations
have used against advocates in
our movements and flop suits
take away resources and capacity
from building a just and
equitable transition. And now
more than ever, we see the
influence of oligarchs on our
governmental systems and the
rollbacks on our rights. HP 169
ensures there's protection for
the First Amendment rights of
every New Mexican, we urge you
to vote in favor. Thank you.
Karen
Yes. Good afternoon, Madam Chair
and members of the committee. My
name is Karen Myers. I'm a
public interest attorney in
Albuquerque, now retired. I urge
you to support House Bill 169
for all the reasons that have
been already stated. Thank you.
Richard
Uh, Madam Chair and committee
members. My name is Richard
Barish. I am the legal chair of
the Sierra Club Rio Grande
chapter, and we stand, we also
stand in strong support of this
bill for the reasons that have
been stated by other speakers,
and I wanted to just talk
briefly about the provenance of
this bill as a uniform law, uh,
uniform laws are drafted by, by
lawyers, judges, legislators,
uh, law professors, um, they
aren't paid, um, they are well
known for being
very well crafted and uh well
thought outlaws, uh, that, that,
uh, are based on sound public
policy on important issues, uh,
Mexico was previously adopted by
my account 74 uniform laws, and
this particular law, even though
it was just uh published in
2020, um, has already been
adopted by 10 states, uh, as
Marasi pointed out, these are uh
red states as well as blue
states and purple states.
Um, and I would strongly urge
the committee to, to uh to pass
on this bill. Thank you.
OK
Thank you. Is there anything
else you'd like to add, uh, just
to, uh, put an accent on the
uniformity of these laws, Madam
Chair, um, I failed to say that
in my intro, but again these are
uniform laws that we're looking
at and enacting. We didn't
create this, it wasn't drafted,
um, entirely by our bill
drafters. This is looking at the
bigger scope picture and what
will happen.
Um
Be more, uh, essentially in line
with a number of other states in
regards to this lap, um,
legislation. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Um.
We'll start with um
representative block.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I have
to be very careful with these
microphones because sometimes
they, they pop. So, Madam Chair,
representative, thank you for
the bill. Uh, I have a few.
Let's just start out here. I'm
going to start on page 2.
Online
9
And so, Madam Chair
Representative, it says a
public.
or an employer or an agent of
governmental acting unit or
purporting to.
To act in an official capacity,
Madam Chair Representative, do
we, what, what does that mean
purporting to, because there
could be someone who's
unauthorized to speak for an
entire department, but maybe
just a division, etc. or maybe
someone outside of that
department. Could you give me a
little clarity on that, Madam
Chair,
Madam Chair, purporting to would
just be those that would be
pretending.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair and
representative. So it wouldn't
include a current employee of,
of a governmental unit that was
not part of the other unit. So
for example, if if someone was
The ABC entity and they were
purporting to be.
The XYZ entity, they were both
governmental units. Would that
be included in this, Madam
Charative Madam Chair
Representative, anyone that
would say that they were in an
official capacity
of a governmental unit would be
within that.
OK, so at the specific unit
though, like I'm just trying to
clarify if they were in the
government, and they said
something.
But another unit in the
government, and it was not true,
they would not be excluded from
this section, Madam Chair.
Because I believe these are
exclusions.
Yeah, so.
It's
In the in the legislation, it
covers all these different
Entities. So if they were
working for a governmental
entity.
They were an employee of the
government.
But they were a different
division than the one they are
purporting to be of.
Maybe he was a former employer,
maybe formerly a X Division.
They're not there currently.
Would they be
Included in this,
Madam Chair,
they would have to be a current
employee or agent of that
governmental unit at the time.
OK, that helps a little bit. So,
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative.
Then
Just going back to the, to the
generalities of the bill. So,
Madam Chair Representative.
Protected expression.
Is that defined in here of
what's protected and how it uses
the word protected.
Can you give me some information
on what that is.
Uh, Madam Chair, Representative,
the entire, um, first page
through line 5 of H2 discusses
what expression is.
Got it. Thank you for that. So,
I mean, I'm in your bill then.
I guess I'll have to just go
through line by line then.
So, Madam Chair Representative,
so except as otherwise provided
in subsection B of this section,
the public expression Protection
Act applies to a cause of action
asserted in a civil action
against a person based on a
person's first tier, we have
communication in a legislative
executive judicial
administrative of other
governments.
Proceeding. So
So pretty much, Madam Chair,
would this just be anything
that's subject to the Open
Meetings Act, for example. Could
you tell me a little more about
what that would entail.
that would include you're
exactly right, um.
Meeting subject to the open
meeting, but it wouldn't be
limited to that because judicial
proceedings.
Uh, it would include judicial
administrative and other
governmental proceedings.
And the way that this is drafted
is intended to protect uh the
most amount of speech possible.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, Representative. So,
so like on an issue under
consideration.
It would have to be so if it was
legislative like us, would have
to be anything that we're doing
regarding the legislation that
we have in front of us. So it
would have to be open, it would
have to be transparent, it would
have to be.
Uh
Available. Is that kind of how I
understand it, Madam Chair
Representative.
Outside of Madam Chair, outside
of anything that's protected
speech as a legislature, such as
speaking on the floor or
something like that, that, yes,
um, this would.
Essentially encumber all of
those other.
Expressionary acts.
OK. Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative. So,
That speech, I guess it would, I
guess I'm just trying to
understand is if it encompasses
everything regarding government,
so I know we have like a, like a
state librarian, for example,
would it include all the books,
all the things that they have in
the library, if they had a board
meeting, would it include the
The state, there's a curator of
of exhibits in the Capitol. I
mean, I'm just trying to figure
out who is included specifically
in this, or is it just relating
to to meetings to phone calls to
correspondence and and where
does it end, Madam Chair,
representative Madam Chair,
how to answer that all
encumbering question, I would
just point you to how it is that
we define um be involved under
public expression and again it's
multiple lines, so it's lines
22.
On the first page through.
Lines 5 on the 2nd page.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. So, OK, let's go
to line 5 talks about on a
matter of public concern
relating to the constitution, do
we have specific guidelines,
what?
A matter of concern could be or
did you cite me?
Somewhere else in statute where
that exists, Madam Chair. Madam
Chair Representative, a matter
of public concern.
Is covered by
Its profits, which is guaranteed
by the US Constitution or
Constitution of New Mexico.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair and
thank you, Representatives. So
now, I guess I'll continue on to
your bill, and I might be going
back and forth. I'm on page 3.
We're talking about.
Section 3.
Starting on line 6. So we're
talking about
60 days after a party is served
with a complaint.
cross-claim counterclaim,
third-party claim, and other
pleading that asserts a cause of
action.
etc. Madam Chair Representative,
why did we pick 60 days for
that?
Madam Chair Representative,
again, it's part of the uniform
law standard, so it was um
decided by a group of.
Uh, folks
Who corresponded nationally to
decide that that threshold would
make sense um for the special
motion for expedited relief,
Madam Chair Representative.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. So this is a
nationwide.
Approach to this, so it's just
uniform.
Between states or
So yes,
Madam Chair Representative, not
to get off the bill, but a
uniform laws um.
Created by a body of folks that
are trying to ensure that we can
all have these types of laws
across various states uniformly.
OK, that makes sense. Thank you,
Madam Chair. And then in section
3.
We have on line 11.
or at a later time on the
showing of good cause.
And you go into what good cause
means, madam chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair,
Representative Black, so that
would be a finding that the
court would make, the court
would determine whether the
litigant had shown good cause.
OK. Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative. Could that also
be
To this extent to not just a
court, but
Other, uh
Other fact finders, if there's
special masters and things like
that included in here or uh
I don't know, mediation, I don't
know if the state state does
mediation occasionally with that
included in that judge's order
or would you go into that for
me, Madam Chair. Madam Chair
Representative, it's a court.
Thank you, Madam Chair, but
unless the court
Let's just say the judge decides
to to send it to mediation,
would it then be in the purview
of mediation?
That that's not.
The venue that would be of
choice for this legislation,
Madam Chair Representative. OK,
perfect. Just trying to clear
that up. I appreciate that,
Madam Chair. Representative, I'm
gonna go to section 4A.
On page 3 talks about.
Automatically stays all
proceedings upon filing of a
motion.
And so
And defendants use this to delay
legitimate cases.
Madam Chair, Representative,
regarding the motion.
We have no reason to believe
that would be.
A reason to do that, Madam Chair
Representative.
All right. Thank you, Madam
Chair Representative, and I'm,
I'm trying to figure that out
because you've said it's uniform
across other states and have
they had issues with that that
you that you know of and.
If they have, what have they
been?
Madam Chair Representative, not
that we know of, no.
OK, Madam Chair Representative.
So how does this pertain to
frivolous claims.
And how are those remedied, if
they are indeed.
Found to be frivolous, Madam
Chair.
Madam Chair Representative, how
does what pertain to frivolous
claims.
Your bill. I'm sorry, I should
have, I should have clarified
that.
Your bill, it changes many
different places in law, and I'm
understanding that you could
file a claim. So what happens if
you file a frivolous one, Madam
Chair.
Mm
Madam Chair Representative, uh,
black, this is actually
precisely what this law is
intended to do, uh, frequently
well resourced individuals,
wealthy individuals and low road
corporations will sue people
with claims that uh have no
merit, and they don't intend
them to have merit. They're
intending to shut speech down,
and so this uh law addresses
precisely that by allowing a
swift resolution of these kinds
of suits to avoid.
having the suits, uh, tie up our
courts in frivolous litigation.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair, and
that, that helps me a little bit
about the scope of this, because
I know currently, of course, in
the Constitution, you have a
right to.
Swift
Ey trial, and I don't know how
much that extends to
Federal or the state branch
government or the local branch.
So,
I just want to make sure that
So we, we currently have that.
So I'm, I'm guessing what
protections does this, does this
add in addition to that.
Madam Chair, I don't know if
you'd be able to answer that,
uh, Madam Chair Representative,
so this law has not been um
updated since 2001, um, I'll
point you to 38-2-9.1, which is
the
Previous um version of this law
again, we didn't have anything
on the books that um.
Remotely
Meets the needs of today's um.
Uh
Uniform laws, um, what we're
seeing with 35 different states
who have passed these laws,
Madam Chair Representative, so
this is an update, um, and a
refresh pertinent to current
happenings in our community,
Madam Chair Representative.
Perfect. Thank you so much,
Madam Chair Representative. And
so you said 38-2-9.1, is that?
Correct.
Yes, I'm sure.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. I'm just looking
at that right now.
OK.
That says
Madam Chair, but while I'm doing
that.
I did have another question
regarding this.
Madam Chair.
Representative
So on pardon me. So on page 23.
We're talking about what
criteria they would use to
determine what qualifies for
expedited dismissal, and you go
into a little bit about what
those criteria are and are they
specified in in rule somewhere
or is this just it? Could you
just give me a little bit more
information about that. I'm just
on page 3.
Line
2, no, no, that's not right, and
I'm sure. I'm just looking at
qualified expedited dismissal.
Let me go to my bill on my
computer.
excited.
OK, Madam Chair. So, um,
There is on page 3.
Lines 6 through 13 talking about
expedited relief and dismissal.
Was there a question, Madam
Chair? Yeah, I'm just wondering,
could you, could you tell me a
little bit about what, what
factors need to be met to have
expedited relief, and I'm.
Or just
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative, this is uh
defined in this uniform.
Uh, law, so essentially all of
the.
Parts of the law that you were
reading about Representative
Black Part B.
Um, I'm sorry, part A, 1 through
3.
So that's in section 2.
defines the kind of speech
that's protected and litigation
that targets that kind of speech
is what the um.
What is the
Thank you so much, Madam Chair
and Representative. OK, that.
Here's it a little bit up for
me?
Uh, so, and then I, I read
somewhere in your bill, and I,
I'm skipping around, I
apologize. I'm on page 5.
I believe, and I'm looking at.
Lines 5 and 6 says emotion
seeking a special or preliminary
injunction to protect against an
imminent threat to public health
and safety, I was imminent
threat defined in your, in your
changes in this legislation,
Madam Chair.
Uh, Madam Chair Representative,
again, that would be to a finder
of fact, um, imminent threat
based on whatever the situation
was, would have to show imminent
immediacy, um.
That's what the fact finder
would be looking for, Madam
Chair Representative.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. So I guess
immediacy could be defined in
many different ways. Do we have
case law pertaining to that in
the state, and how is that
applied to this, because
immediacy could be, you know,
something that's an emergency
happening today or it could be
something within the week. If
there was like a dam that was
gonna break or something within
a week. How is that?
And of defined in case law and
statutes and the state manager
again, Madam Chair
Representative, all of that
exactly what you just brought up
could be immediacy, so it really
depends on.
How that's decided in a court.
Perfect. OK.
Thank you, Madam Chair. And I,
so I guess it just gives the
judge discretion on that.
Got it.
So, Madam Chair Representative,
I'm gonna go over to page 6.
And I had a question about the
burden of proof that was needing
to be met.
What does that look like burden
of proof wise and does this
change that because I know it's
a new language, it says satisfy
a burden pursuant to subsection
A of subsection 7, that's on,
that's on page 4 and then.
Continues on to the next page.
So I'm wondering,
What, what is that burden of
proof needed? Is it any higher
or lower than currently in in
statute. I'm on page 4, line 16,
but it follows down to the next
page.
If I'm understanding your
correction, uh, your question
correctly, Madam Chair
Representative, the standard
burden is just whether or not
the loss, if the uh petitioner
can demonstrate um that the
lawsuit was frivolous.
That would be the proof
necessary, um.
In that time, if, if I, I'm
understanding your question
correctly, Madam Chair.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair.
Yeah, that, that does help me. I
just want to know what, what
standard needs to be met burden
wise. And so if it was
frivolous, of course, it would
probably just get tossed away.
They wouldn't even have standing
if they didn't get that burden.
So I just want to make sure that
it's clear.
If they did file a lawsuit on
these grounds that they would
have that kind of.
It would have some kind of
threshold on what burden needs
to be met, right? So, I don't
know if it's different from from
government to
Like a civil suit, for example,
or a criminal. So burden wise,
would it just be you needed to
be harmed in some way. How, how
is that?
How's that, Madam Chair, Madam
Chair Representative again.
Based on the definition and
reading prior languages to what
the burden would be, would be
required to establish.
That the suit was frivolous and
the back and forth between both
parties, whether it wasn't or
whether it was, again, it all
depends upon the facts of.
Um, what the lawsuit was that
was filed and whether or not
there was a counter to that
being frivolous, etc. so it just
provides the process for what
that would look like, Madam
Chair Representative.
OK. Sounds good. Thank you,
Madam Chair Representative. So
then, I did have a question on
section 6 about dismissal or
maybe section.
Uh
My question about that was,
Do they have to complete
discovery.
For a motion for judgment on the
pleading is decided. Madam Cha
representative.
Uh, Mountain Chair
representative, it depends, um.
On where they would be in that
process, um.
A judge can decide to throw it
out immediately, what was
presented and again.
Discovery would be later on,
depending on what the judge
decided to.
Process should be, Madam Chair
Representative.
Perfect. OK, thank you, Madam
Chair Representative. I guess
my, my concerns regarding that
is
There's a lot to be decided from
the judge.
And so, I think they're
Have you contemplated more
specific
Guidelines
Or the judge when it comes to
just the proceedings in general
because a couple of questions
I've asked regarding multiple
stages of the case. It's all
about.
The judge determines X, Y, and
Z. And so I know we're trying to
be very, very, uh,
In continuity with other states
when it comes to uniformity. But
I'm just wondering, have other
states enhanced such language to
give judges.
Now, I want, I don't want to say
less discretion, but I do want
to say more tools of guideline.
So that they can determine these
kinds of very murky gray area
places and why wasn't that
included in in the legislation,
Madam Chair Representative.
Madam Chair Representative, um.
If I'm trying, I'm trying to
understand your question, um,
judges are very well trained to
determine the facts of a case
and.
Decide what the process should
be as a coequal branch of
government they.
are trained to have that power
to make those determinations
through a very regimented
process following the letter of
the law that should we pass
this, they would provide them a
process to go through which
currently is unfortunately very
outdated, um, as to what these
protections could be and what
the process would look like. So
this actually clarifies in many
ways what.
That should, what we, how we
should proceed.
OK.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. Yeah, and I, and
I don't want to be taking away
any kind of uh constitutional
parameters between our branches,
but I do want to make sure that
those are, those are considered.
And also I did have concerns I
asked earlier about the 60 days,
and I know currently in rural
areas, right? rural, rural
courts, they're backed up.
Really long time. And what if
the individual plaintiff
Besides
Not to wave
The right to speedy.
trial, etc. They don't want to
waive that. They want 60 days,
boom, that's it, done. What,
what do we do regarding that to
get the resources down to
Sports to be able to, to
determine in fact find and do
all the things that are mandated
in in this new language.
Do, do we have any concerns
with, with that and how have we
addressed that, Madam Chair,
Representative.
Um, Madam Chair,
Representative, I guess I'm, I'm
trying to understand your
question again. Um, are you
worried about the speedy trial
in a rural area or I I'm trying
to understand what the concern
is Madam Chair, I am, and then
I'm also referring to
I believe the appeal deadline on
this is 30 days.
So, Madam Chair Representative,
I just want to understand.
How that will determine how a
more rural court.
Utilizes their resources to
comply with this.
And so I just want some clarity
on that, Adam representative,
um, the threshold of dates is.
Always are usually very um.
It essentially similar, it's
part for the rules of civil
procedure go, these thresholds
of 60 days, 30 days or.
Again, uniform with being able
to act and respond to petitions,
etc. these are not out of line
with.
And whether it be rural, urban,
or whatever, um, access to
justice, 1 may have, like these
are rather again, uniform with
what that looks like.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you for that. And I'm glad
that we're addressing that
because I certainly don't wanna.
putting anything more stringent
than current law in the state,
and I know we're doing uniform
laws across the state. So I just
want to make sure.
In Mexico, we're different than.
state that passed it, so.
That's good that at least it's
uniform. So,
Madam Chair Representative, I'm
just going to continue on now to
the, the analysis that I have in
front of me from the agencies.
So, Madam Chair, Representative,
I'm gonna go to the the fur.
On page 2.
Let me get to that. Uh, I did a,
I see a concern here regarding
the absorption of costs to
implement.
This
Let me leave it's the AOC who
may have had some concerns. So,
Madam Chair Representative, I
just want to make sure that they
have
Proper and adequate tools.
So regarding resources and
costs, have we spoken to the AOC
and and what are they saying?
Madam Chair, Representative, you
like we just get the uh analysis
we haven't spoken with the AOC
there aren't any.
Concert to be addressed, and
again, this is a uniform law so.
OK. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Yeah, I just want to make sure
that the AOC has got resources
because I know that they're
always looking for, for more,
and we, we would love to give
them more, but I do think that's
important. So,
Madam Chair, Representatives.
Representative, I see.
On the FIR it talks about Peppa.
So
This law, Peppa, so how does
this change the slap.
Legislation that we currently
have in the state.
It's a strategic lawsuits
against public participation.
Uh, Madam Chair Representative,
I, I think we've answered that.
It's a, it's a.
An adoption of
Essentially a modernized law,
um.
To be able to prevent frivolous
lawsuits, um, against free
speech in our state.
if you could ask different
questions. You've been almost a
half an hour now.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I just
want to make sure that the folks
in these departments, they have
the resources and and their
concerns are addressed, and I
think that's important. And, and
so I appreciate that. So, Madam
Chair, representative that helps
me a lot. I'm gonna continue on
here and I have.
Some questions regarding the
Legal impacts. So I have a
question from a constituent here
actually. What legal mechanisms
exist to prevent abuse of one of
HB 169 protections. So I know
that this person's, they work in
the government, they just want
to make sure that it's not used,
used.
Uh, Madam Chair, Representative,
this is meant to protect those
um from abuse of frivolous
lawsuits, I, I don't know how it
would be abused in reverse if
you.
Um, understand that, Madam Chair
Representative.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair. I, I
just wanted to make sure that
that was addressed because I did
have a constituent concern about
that whenever we put new law on
the books, we do want to make
sure that that
concludes that. So, Madam Chair
Representative, my next thing is
on the AG's analysis.
Page 3 of that analysis, it
says, it suggests that HB 169
provides a redundant legal
pathway. I'm wondering if you
could address that concern from
the Attorney General's office.
I don't know if I have an extra
copy. Let me see here.
Oh, I, I think I see the
Attorney general's analysis
would be considered redundant.
This, um, as you, as it
proceeds, it says it's more
specific in providing certainty,
recourse avenues, so.
That we agree is the intention
of this legislation. OK, thank
you, Madam Chair, and then how
would this interact with the
federal nowhere Pennington
protections,
madam Representative, this is a
state law, so it would affect uh
litigation in our state courts,
and if it were heard by the
federal court, our federal
courts would need to make a
decision about that.
OK, got it. Thank you, Madam
Chair. And then how does this
work in conjunction with or
contradicting New Mexico Tort
Claims Act.
If at all.
Madam Chair, Representative
Black.
Uh, it could, I, I don't see a
connection uh between this law
and the New Mexico Tort Claims
Act.
OK, thank you so much, Madam
Chair and Representative, that
helps me. So I, I had some more
questions regarding states. I
will just not ask those in the
interest of time.
Madam Chair Representative.
I guess I am reading this
correctly. Yeah, so.
How does this work in
conjunction with with
journalistic integrity and
protections there.
Regarding the the government.
What was the question,
Madam Chair for journalists.
How does that impact that?
I.
Madam Chair, Representative, the
legislation protects and
expansive body of speech,
including speech by journalists,
so it would protect journalists
against.
Slap suits. OK, thank you, Madam
Chair, and uh thank you so much
Representative and expert for
the que the answers and uh.
job. Thank you.
OK, next we have Representative
Lord.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you.
I think the expert.
Herbs
question in the world that I
could come up with, but I did
have a few more men chair
representatives. So can you
explain it because this is a a
bill that I'm unfamiliar with
and how that system works. So in
New Mexico, we have the
frivolous lawsuit claim.
Mm
And that awards attorney fees
and costs.
If the consequence of filing a
lawsuit, does that also apply to
this bill is where and where is
that in the bill?
Madam Chair Representative, it
follows that same logic is what
you're describing.
OK, Madam Chair Remsen, is it
specifically in the bill or is
it in?
Uh, Madam Chair, Representative,
we clarify, um, a process for
which you would be able to file
um.
Or, or, um, dismissive frivolous
lawsuit, um, should it be uh
abusing.
Essentially, free speech, um
protections, Madam Chair
Representative. Madam Chair,
what page is that on? Sorry, I
know ribs and blocked ask a lot
of questions. I was trying to
pay attention. It was a lot. So
what pages that
that would be on page 7.
Um
As I was looking up some
information on the U Peppa.
Uh, I noticed that some states
already applied this. It's just
bill similar to the other states
and by the.
Uh, that's correct, Madam Chair,
one of the oversights was not,
uh, putting in the title
uniform, the public expression
Protection Act for this spill.
So, thank you, because I was
trying to see how this plays out
compared to what other states
are doing to see if there's been
issues. I know there's been some
amendments since then.
Census bills, a few states that
I'm already.
Um, I'm Sharison, one of the
things that I did notice about
with these bills.
Um
It says that if a plaintiff sues
a journalist in federal court
for a state law court such as
libel. It's not clear but the
journalists can evoke this.
Anti-slap, so how would that
play out if this did for a
state.
support.
Madam Chair Representative, that
would be an open question of
law. There's a division among
the US courts of appeals about
that very question, and we would
urge that it does provide that
protection even in federal
court.
And tremors and that's what I
was looking at this is something
that it's nonpartisan.
Artisan that was
Quite a bit bit of an issue in
there and they're stating all
these different.
Court cases where that could
become an issue, so that does
play into this.
Um, Madam Chair Representative.
I had questions about my
daughter.
Uh, I have a question that sorry
if this sounds like a stupid
question, but.
When I know everything's at
discretion of a judge, but are
there specific tools I know that
represented as but is there like
specific tools when it comes to
frillis cause it kind of seems
like it's.
Really up in the air. I was even
looking at the.
Uh, New Mexico.
I see that we do have
Section 49 47 97 or to terms of
any, I just, it doesn't talk
about, it talks about what to
do, but it doesn't define.
Frivolous. So is there anything
in your material here, Madam
Chair an expert that defines.
What frivolous means.
Um, Madam Chair Representative,
um, it's not defined since it's
a sort of well um understood
common terms as to what that
lawsuit would look like to a
judge, so we, again, the uniform
law doesn't define it here, um.
Is.
Go ahead, sorry, no manicurist
and expert, uh, so.
Like we have the Arnold tool for
with crimes, is there any kind
of tool, cause I know when you
have something that is open to
interpretation. Is there any
tool that the judges used
totally up to their discretion
in defining whether case is
privilege.
Chairs representative, there is
a a well defined body of case
law about speech that's
protected and also well defined
body of case law about.
The kinds of claims that people
typically bring in these cases,
the frivolous claims that they
bring, so these can be claims
like defamation and other things
like that, and so courts will be
applying that well defined body
of law in making those very
decisions.
Chair and Representative uh
expert is there.
What happens to a person if they
feel that their claim is not
frivolous, then is he not hands?
Did they reapply? Did they
appeal? What are they? What's
the next step after?
Madam Chair Representative, uh,
I'm glad you asked that
question, so they're actually
um.
3 phases to this, uh, law and so
the first phase is the actual
filing of the motion to end the
proceedings, the second phase is
a decision about
creammaashi, um, viability of
the suit, and that's a decision
that the judge would make at the
district court level in the 3rd,
um, in the 3rd phase is legal
viability.
And uh if.
The moving party meets the
burden, the moving party wins
and the cause of action ends,
um, and is stricken with
prejudice and so that ensures
that the suit can't be brought
again.
OK, so I got all that part that
makes explain to you for
explaining that.
Would would that person if they
say no, this is absolutely not
frivolous. I don't want to pay
these legal.
costs. What's in, do they
appeal? Do they reapply or what
is it that that person does
next. If they don't agree with
the judge.
Madam Chair Representative, yes,
they would be able to appeal.
Madam Chair Representative, I
would assume, I'm going to
assume.
that when they do this, they do
the appeal that all the costs
are on them to do that is.
On the person who would say I
don't agree with the judge.
They're going back to court.
They have to get their own
lawyer. They have to pay for and
if they do, if it is found out
that.
They actually won that case,
which would be very
I'm trying to think of somebody
who would win that case. I'm
trying to think of extreme case.
Would they be able to with those
legal costs, not be a burden
upon them and would they be able
to win their case including any
further legal fees.
If they were able to win on
appeal, Madam Chair, they would
be able to retain recover any
legal fees that were extended.
Thank you, Madam Chair Weser. So
a few more questions on this.
Sorry, let me turn this off
while I flip pages. It's very
annoying.
So Madam Chair, I was looking
at, it was analysis from the
AOC.
is on
it.
I
was their last.
Issue that they had on
significant issues. I have a
question on this.
Uh, it says a few differences
between the uniform Act, HB 169,
Section 2C describing the
intention of the papa to confer
substantive immunity from suit
and not merely immunity from
liability does not exist in the
UEA.
So do you want to make a comment
on that.
Um, versus what they said versus
the you Peppa.
Me.
Where,
OK,
so I'm in the
AOC analysis, this is like one.
To
or page 5. It's the last page.
And it's up at the top and
they're talking about the
difference between the uniform
Act and your bill.
They
Had put in there
to confer substantive immunity
from suit and not really
immunity from liability.
It does not exist. Is there a
reason why there's a difference
between your bill and the cuz
they go on the same miniature.
Madam Chair Representative, if
we're following this correctly,
I think it's just the idea that
the drafting decisions on some
of these uniform laws may not
read exactly as it depends upon
constructing of laws and so um.
That may be the nuance there
that um.
is in question as to whether or
not it's uniform or not, I think
it's just probably a drafting
decision.
OK, Madam Chair, because they go
on to say.
Anti-slap laws do not insulate
defendants from any liability
for claims arising from
protected rights of petition or
speech, they only provide a
procedure of weeding out an
early stage meritless claims
rising from protect activity and
then they want to.
Reference a suit.
Uh, the UPEPA section 15
contains this severability
clause and HB 169 does not. Can
you explain why you didn't put
that into your.
And if you need a copy to read,
I just read through that, we can
get that if need be.
Mentors, I think might be online
on the leg.
Madam Chair Representative, I
think I'm, I'm, I have the AOC,
um, it's the very last.
It's a few differences between
the Uniform Act and this and my
question mainly is about.
And
You have a section 15 contains a
severability clause at HB 169
does not, and I wanted to know.
Madam Chair Representative, I
think it's because those
sections that we may already be
included in current law, so
again, they don't reconstruct
things that are that are already
existing law, so.
Um, I think that on the
uniformity that that's
unnecessary, it's already in
current law.
Representative. OK, madam chair
and Representative, um, OK,
thank you for that. I just have
a few more questions applying to
the
Department of Justice analysis.
Um
They had a few concerns on
there.
Because I only had a question on
a few of these now.
So Madam Chair and
Representative at and the
significance issue is HP 169
also appears to further protect
individuals in the same manner
as anti-slap statues already in
place in New Mexico and MSA
1978, 1938-2-9.1 and 38-2-9.2
section 15 of the HB 169
proposed to repeal the anti-slap
statutes. These statues are
enacted with the goal of
protecting its citizens against
lawsuits from retaliation. So
they're basically saying we
already have this under this.
Statue. Would you like to expand
on that and
Address their issue on it being
a significant issue. Madam Chair
Representative, as we said in
our intro, that lasts law has
not been updated since 2001.
And this, um,
Brings us up to 21st century
current situation with how these
slap suits are being used and
creates the process of which
we've been describing in the
last hour, Madam Chair
Representative.
Madam Chair, thank you for that,
um.
They also go on to say that
federally, and I'm gonna destroy
this last name Nor Pennington,
Doc and provides First Amendment
protections for citizens.
Who petitioned the govern the
government, they go on to say US
12781 and Pennington 38.1, 657
under the Nor Penitent doctrine,
those who engage in conduct
aimed at influencing government,
including litigation or shielded
from retaliation provided.
Their conduct is not a sham. The
New Mexico Supreme Court has
followed the outline process,
expedit timelines and the
federally required heightened
scrutiny of the North Penitent
doctrine when evaluing the slap
lawsuits in Mexico, although it
can be titled.
To such First Amendment
protection activity may be
genuine, not a sham.
So Madam Chair representative,
they have a few issues on that
also HB 169 on the next page
appears to find avenues for
dismissal of claims that might
currently fall under New Mexico
anti-slap statues and possibly
in New Mexico Tort Claims Act.
Animusa 41-4-1.
And the New Mexico civil rights,
HB 169 also proves to provide
avenues for dismissive claims
that might fall under the
federal nor Pennington Doctrine.
So it, it seems like they're
saying that there's some
redundancy that it's already
under the New Mexico Tort Claim
Axis running in the New
Mexicanti slap, but it's also
under this nor penitent nor
Hennington doctrine, Madam Chair
Representative, so firstly, we
are putting this into state
statute to make it state law,
um, that's whether it be a
doctrine or otherwise, we want
this to be affirmatively.
in lots about a process to
follow. Secondly, I'll just
point out that this is um um
the.
This entire section starts with
might currently fall like we
have the current statue that we
have before you that we're
proposing falls under any of
these, um, other statutes,
otherwise we would have.
clarified that, um, so we're
we're.
Affirmatively sure that what
we're doing here is with the
uniform law before you, Madam
Chair Representative is to
ensure that we've updated this
law.
And chair representative on that
same page, it also says
additionally HP 169 proposes
that such a dismissal motion may
be appealed, the proposed
language is not specify which
court would have jurisdiction.
Can you tell us what courts
would have jurisdiction and why
that's not lined out cause that
seems to be an issue.
For the Department of Justice.
So, uh,
The way that Madam Chair
represented the appeal process
would be under the New Mexico
rules of civil procedure and so.
An appeal would go to the New
Mexico Court of Appeals.
Thank you Madam Chair,
represented, um,
I think I have one more
question. Let me just read this
real quick, OK.
So in section 10, still from the
DOJ HB 169 proposes that
attorneys' fees be collected by
the individual moving.
party or the responsible
governmental party, the
responding party may only
recover if they can show such
motion, which we said in there
early about being frivolous
as HB 169 does not indicate
where the funds should come
from.
should the motion be filed
against the legistrs not known
where the legislature has funds
directly set up.
Aside for legal fees or whether
an immunity.
Might bar the government from
paying such fees. Do you want to
address that concern from the
DOJ? I'm sorry, backs off, um.
And so again, just depending on
the facts of a case.
That recovery would have to
proceed with.
Um
Whatever, whatever.
OK, Madam Chair, that's all the
questions that I have.
An interesting journey down you
Peppa and.
Public expression Protection
Act, uh, that's all the
questions I have.
Thank you.
OK, we have a motion for a due
pass by representative Thompson
in a second by Representative
Rubio.
Um
Or is
Uh, there any, uh, opposition.
OK, take roll.
Representative block.
No, and I'd like to explain my
vote quickly. Representative
Lord, and a quick explanation.
Representative Romero, yes.
Representative Thompson.
Yes, Madam Vice Chair. Yes,
Madam Chair, yes.
OK, um,
You have a due pass on House
Bill 169 um on a vote of 4 to 2.
And represented a block to
explain your vote. Thank you so
much, Madam Chair, and thank
you, Representative and Good
Bill. I, I would love to vote
for it. I apologize. I just have
not been able to, uh,
Look at all the analyses and
everything, and I love the, the
handouts you gave. I mean, I
really love the National
Taxpayers Union. I do. They're a
good group. But I just want to
make sure that
I understand completely what the
bill does, and I appreciate the
answers today and uh I'll be
ready on the floor if it gets
there, Madam Chair.
Thank you. Thank you. I.
Yes, you wanted to explain your
vote too. Yeah, thank you, Madam
Chair Representatives. I might
be a yes on the floor. I just
have to learn more about the
bill and make sure.
The way through
Thank you. And I um I'm going to
take another bill out of order
because of the time and the um
We're going to go to house Bill
76 general heart disease tests
for infants.
Representative Thompson.
Madam Chair
Could you tell me what, what
Well, we're talking about we're
moving this to front of the
agenda, I don't understand. I
think that has to be experts who
have had to wait since 1:30 and
um they um.
Or
They have to leave. So we are
going to go ahead and do that. I
understand that, Madam Chair,
but they were at the bottom of
the agenda, so.
I'm just
trying to we're taking
such a long time, it's
prerogative of the chair. Thank
you.
Apresentative Thompson thank
you, Madam Chair
this is, this bill is to
prevent.
Infants from leaving the
hospital with the cardiac, with
the congenital cardiac defect.
It, we, we as a state have in
the bill, um.
On a House Bill 76, starting on
page um the very bottom of page
1 line 25, a list of all the
tests that we do on newborns to
to make sure that they don't
have things like cystic
fibrosis, maple syrup, urine
disease, sickle cell anemia, and
a whole bunch more that are a
lot longer games.
So, Madam Chair, what this does,
uh, and, and I probably should
uh go over the amendment first,
so I do have an amendment.
Madam Chair, I moved to, um, and
we'll hand the amendment out.
And Madame Chair, we may have
experts on Zoom depending on how
the question.
So let him chair as far as the
amendment, um.
It, so it starts on page 3, line
13, strike and an insert in lieu
thereof or.
And then go to page, uh, page
13.
Line page 3, line 14 after
electrocardiogram, strike the
remainder of the line and strike
lines 15 through 25 and on page
4 strike lines 12 through 3 and
in insert in lieu thereof.

then on page 4.
Line 20 after society.
Insert a comma.
Um, OK, and, and on page 4 line
20 before and insert the
American Society of

And then I'm sure those are the.
Madam Chair, I have questions.
I, I put my name on the list
with, with.
I mean that's as long as we have
the risk um representative Lord.
Black.
And this is on the amendment on
the amendment,
I read what the amendment was
and very
Very
Scholastic language. I just want
to make sure. Can you tell me in
layman's terms, what is the
difference between your
amendment and the stricken
language because it's a large
section of text, and I just want
to make sure I understand. Could
you go through that for me?
Madame cheer and Representative
Bloch. So I will tell you that
this amendment was in response
to concerns that we have heard
from providers. Um, so basically
it before it had a list of um.
We have had so many amendments
on this, we've taken a lot of a
lot of.
Input from various folks. So
basically what this amendment
does is spells out under what
conditions.
A provider.
Needs to do further
investigation of an infant's
heart to make sure that they are
not, they do not have.
congenital heart disease.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. So, OK, so
before it had certain certain
frameworks.
And you're adding, cause I see
the word.
For example, let me just add
this quickly, uh.
We talked about sudden infant
death syndrome.
sudden cardiac death, aborted
sudden cardiac death.
I guess was that in the current
language and are we?
How are we changing that
regarding.
What the physician must do.
from the current language to the
amendment.
Regarding those. So sudden.
Cardiac death
aborted sudden cardiac death.
Or
Sudden infant death
on page 3.
Um
This talks about what the
conditions would be that would
require further testing and the
amendment just clarifies it, um.
As I said, we have taken advice
from.
From physicians and um.
Other healthcare providers on
what would be a cleaner and more
targeted.
List of of conditions that would
put an infant at risk for um
heart disease.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair
Representative, and I'm not
seeing it in the current one,
the.
we said first degree relatives
with.
Um implantable defibrillator and
then first degree relatives. So
is, are these new, these new
requirements.
Or the scope
The first degree relatives, and
then 3rd degree.
Is that different from the
current?
Language
Madam, I, I have no idea what
you, I, I don't know that
there's 3rd degree, uh, if you
could please give me a line and
there's no lines on the
amendment, but it's the
6th from the bottom.
On 6 and 7, madam chair, 6567.
So, um, Representative, it's all
first degree relatives, there's
no 3rd degree. OK. Thank you,
Madam Chair, because I see on
page, I'm sorry, online, the 6th
from the top on number 6 it
says.
I'm sorry.
From the top says first degree.
So
implement them. OK, I just want
to make sure all of these
individual instances were not in
the bill. Any degrees whatsoever
we're not currently in the bill.
These are newly added in the
amendment.
I just want to make sure. Is
that correct?
Madam Chair and Representative
Block that there um if you look
at the original bill, which we
probably shouldn't, well, never
mind, um, so it does talk about
biological parents, um.
And so this is, this is
expanding it a little to maybe a
sibling or.
Or um
Yeah
OK, so Madam Chair, so it
wouldn't be like a grandparent
or a or an aunt or something. It
would have to be direct.
A brother or sister, dad, mom,
kind of thing, Madam, is that
kind of what I'm getting?
Yes
Ma
OK,
sorry, thank you.
Hi, good evening, Madam Chair
and members of the legislative
consumer and Public Affairs
Committee.
Thank you for the opportunity to
speak today.
I want to share with you our
family's journey and highlight
an issue impacting countless
families. Our oldest son was
chronically ill from birth.
And for 15 years.
Despite seeing over 300 doctors,
providers.
Including 40 specialists.
Cause of this illness remained a
mystery.
Finally
He was diagnosed with a
congenital heart defect, CHD.
Dime size.
Finding and repairing it ended
15 years of suffering.
Today his recovering and
thriving.
But our question remains.
Why did it take so long?
To the deck something so
significant.
As we shared our story, others
reached out with similar
accounts of diagnosed CHDs.
It's inspired us to found
Oleinhart, a nonprofit dedicated
to promoting awareness, creating
partnerships, and advocating for
best practices in the detection,
diagnosis and treatment of CHDs.
Especially in our youth.
In an underserved communities.
PhDs are the most common birth
defect worldwide.
Affecting 1 in 100 children.
60 times more prevalent than all
forms of childhood cancer
combined.
Yet 1/3 of CHDs remain
undetected until later in life.
Often after years of suffering.
Early detection
batter screening can save lives.
Our nonprofit aims to close this
gap by raising awareness,
improving screening practices
and ensuring equitable access to
care.
Thank you for your time and
consideration.
I look forward to your questions
and discussing how we can work
together to improve outcomes for
children.
And families impacted by CHDs.
My name is I'm here with my wife
Sandra Forlander.
Madam Chair and committee
members, my name is Sandra
Sanchez Farlander.
And I'm here on behalf of the
hole in the heart, a nonprofit
dedicated to improving in
general heart disease care in
New Mexico.
This week is congenital heart
Defect Awareness Week.
It runs yearly from February 7th
through um today I want to
highlight a critical gap in our
healthcare system.
One that directly impacts early
diagnosis and quality of life
for families across our state.
There is a high rate of public
insurance in our state, and it
has been reported that pregnant
women who are in public health
insurance are less likely to
receive a fetal ultrasound.
Which is a key tool in detecting
congenital heart defects before
birth.
Without this screening, many
heart conditions go undiagnosed
until symptoms appear later in
life.
One of the most effective ways
to improve early detection is by
ensuring that all healthcare
providers, not just
pediatricians, but midwives,
family doctors, and rural
practitioners as parents of
newborns about their family
history of heart disease.
If a parent, sibling, or
grandparent has a history of
heart disease, heart defects,
sudden cardiac events or
unexplained deaths, it should
immediately signal the need for
further evaluation.
By making family heart health
history, a standard part of
newborn care.
We can identify potential risks
sooner.
Leading to early intervention
and better outcomes for patients
across New Mexico.
I urge policymakers and
healthcare leaders to support
efforts that educate providers
on the importance of asking
these questions and ensuring
families receive the following.
Thank you, and we will go back
to discussion on the amendment.
There anymore. Thank you, Madam
Chair. So, Madam Chair,
representatives, OK. The
representative, I see here.
Change is made, so.
Does this still require the
Electrocardiogram.
Or
The echocardiogram?
Still, I
And
Madam Chair Representative, yes.
OK, but it just
diminishes it or not diminishes
it, it just reduces.
to just folks who have.
relatives.
Or Madam Chair.
Well, first degree relatives who
have certain conditions, I see.
So, OK, that, that makes a
little more sense to me. I think
that's, that cleared up my
question, Madam Chair.
Madam Chair, um, representative
Block, can I speak please? Of
course, please go ahead. We are
the provider.
evaluation and based on their.
Question, they have a decision
to order an EKG.
Madam Chair and it's, it's to
not, not to mandate what and
take away the decision making of
the healthcare provider, but to
encourage them to, to request
further testing if if.
The history, etc. or some
findings, um, indicate that that
would be useful.
OK, thank you so much, Madam
Chair, and, and that, that helps
me, so.
That kind of brought up a little
question though. I, I apologize.
So it's not mandating it on
these individuals who have these
He's a
conditions in their family.
But it's, it's pretty much just
To ensure that they
Uh, they, they can.
Refer, can they not refer
currently for these?
Without the changes in this
amendment,
they can't, it's that we're
trying to say, please do, if
you, if there's a suspicion, we
are encouraging, not mandating.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair, and
that, that helps me on the
amendment. Thanks.
Representative Lord. Uh thank
you, Madam Chair on the
amendment, yeah, yes, on the
amendment, yeah.
and experts. I do have a
question.
It's very interesting on the
CDC.
When they say screening for
critical congenital heart
disease.
Actually, the only thing they
have on here.
Which is also interesting to
give false results is the um
I don't know if I'm gonna say
this right, the pulse oximeter.
So if you go to the CDC, that's
all they say.
And then I was reading about
false positives, false negatives
on that. So that was very
interesting that they have.
The very bare minimum.
And the more you learn when
you're a Medicare
representative, so.
On
This you're keeping.
You have the pulse oximeter
which can't, yeah, this is.
Um, mentioned representative,
so, um, you.
are keeping
The echocardiogram, but she
removing
The electrocardiogram from being
mandated. Is that correct? Is
there a reason for that because
I see it on the amendment.
It says on page 314 after.
Electrocardiograms strike
everything.
So we're keeping, we're keeping,
oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, I read
that wrong. That's my mistake.
I'm sorry. I was trying to
figure out why we were going to
remove that and I just realized
it's a second word on there.
So Madam Chair ribs on this.
When we go through this,
So all this new material.
We're talking about we remove
this.
And we're adding
Right
Some criteria for the medical
doctors or the evaluators to
say.
That we do those with the pulse,
and then we also.
By means of a test from, I'm
trying to figure out the
sequence.
So they do the pulse.
Si, there might be something
variant, then we're adding in
the we keep these two things,
but now we're saying, just
explain this portion to me. I'm
sure representative.
When something comes back weird,
are we saying that they should
look at all these other things,
or are you stating in this
amendment that you should have
looked in their history to do
these automatically. Does that
make sense? I representative
that I'm chairing
representative, um.
We are electric, I mean, um,
pulse oximetry is kind of the
basic and.
And we are hoping that folks who
are dealing with newborns, if
there is any um.
Abnormalities in the pulse ox or
if there is a family history of
any of these things that they do
further testing.
To make sure that we don't have
infants being released from the
hospital who are, you know, I
mean, I, I worked on a a bill
similar to this in 2013 and
their baby died. Um, they were
they went home from the hospital
and um.
And the baby died within a day
or two.
OK, Madam, yeah, I'm seeing how
this.
I would hope, Madam Chairman, by
the way this is worded, they're
going to do that pulse
automatically on all babies, is
that correct? OK. So they're
doing that, Madam Chair
representative experts on all
the babies.
And then you're asking him, do
these if they have.
Parent or close, we're talking
close family passed out like, oh
sorry, new one amendment.
Uh, if the family is congenital
heart disease and cardiac death.
Uh, so sudden infant death, so
if their brother or sister or
would that also be aunts and
uncles or just brothers and
sisters?
Probably just brothers and
sisters because they wouldn't
be, I mean, I'm I'm telling this
to myself, they wouldn't be
parents because if they were
sudden infant death, they would
have made it to age of pair, so
I'm trying to manage what I was
looking at, I'm looking in the
family tree, right? I'm looking,
so if they have a brother and
sister, yes, I would also for me
expand it to if the parents had
brothers or sisters.
That have these issues too,
because it could.
You could have, maybe they both
didn't get both the recessive
allele and it's not expressing
itself to this child, but maybe
it's being carried by an aunt or
an uncle. So sorry, that's your
representative we're not
excluding looking further at the
family we are just saying at
least first degree, you know,
if, if the provider is um.
You know, ask the question and
says, oh yeah, you know, I had
22 sisters who died then um.
Then we're not we're not.
Removing any of the tools, we're
just adding suggestions to use
more tools to protect our
newborns. Yeah, Madam Chair and
I support that. I just for me, I
would add.
Aunts and uncles too, because
that could be these two people
did not get both at the
recessive alleles come together
to express that disorder, but it
may be very strongly carried.
by that aunt or uncle that
passed away, and it may be in
that child. So that, that's what
I'm saying. So I'm just.
I worked in, we have kept it,
um, more narrow because we, we
want this bill to pass, we don't
want someone to come and say,
well, if you know if it's gonna
be an aunt or an uncle, then
it's gonna, you know, so we're
trying to target it and as I
said, not not not.
Not allow the provider to to ask
any questions or do anything,
but this is what we're
suggesting and we're trying to
keep it narrow based on on um
input we've gotten from.
Uh medical providers. OK, Madam
Chair, that was kind of my other
question on this section because
I want to make sure it's very
inclusive. Are these all of the
things.
In a
Family lineage, what we're
looking at close, that would be
indicative of a child that may
have.
In general, the heart disease.
These express question, and
where did they come from in
shares.
Be sure they they are, um, these
are the recommended ones, um, it
again, it's not to say that that
more can't be asked or more
can't be looked at, but I mean,
it could become an ever never
ending list if we put in all the
things that might have some sort
of genetic.
Um
Or familial component that would
lead to congenital heart
disease. OK. Thank you, ma'am.
Charge. I think that's all I
had. I just want to see where
these came from and when we're
talking about family to me and I
understand why you don't want to
add that I was looking at aunts
and uncles cause that if you had
it and or uncle or brother or
sister, sorry if you had a
brother or sister of the parent,
and they have that and it didn't
get expressed that child may
still necessarily that it might
be missed.
Um
And the only other question I
had, we don't, are we asking?
Is there anything there? I'm
sorry I didn't notice. Is there
anything in here, uh, about
blood tests? Are they doing any
blood tests in here?
Madam Chair and Representative,
they have not been indicative.
They've not been helpful in
making this diagnosis.
Thank you, ma'am. I was just
looking at some, I'm sure it's
all the questions I have on
this. Thank you. The amendment.
Thank you, Representative
Romero.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair. Uh,
I'm just trying to also follow
along with the intent to make
this optional for the provider,
um, I think.
If that was the intent, I
unfortunately, I don't know if
the amendment actually gets that
to that point when.
Both in the title.
And then this section one, it
talks about tests being
required.
Um
electrocardiogram, so the
required tests, um.
And so I, I'm
that flexibility doesn't read in
the law, so I'm.
Just concerned, Madam Chair, in
the amendment that it
unfortunately won't get us to
the place of.
Um
That, that nuance with allowing
the provider to then
enact
opt into something rather than
have to, there's no opting out,
unfortunately with this either,
madam chair, so Madam Chair, and
that, that's an error that was
supposed to be removed and we we
will um do a further amendment
to have the required, well, see,
it's kind of um.
It's kind of muddy because the
other tests are required and
it's, so that may have been
where it got kind of confused
that all the other tests that
are listed in the bill are
required, so we will work with
the drafter how to best say that
without it. OK.
I hear a second.
Uh, representative Thompson was
2nd.
just on process.
Um, if we're adopting the
amendment and it's not actually
in the right.
of the
Uh
Possibility of the opt-in versus
opt out since it is under the
required test statute, I'm
concerned, Madam Chair,
representative, that.
Since we're gonna need to um
Figure out what how to word the
requirement piece. I'm
concerned, Madam Chair
representative, that we, we may
have to rework where this goes,
if we, even if we adopt it now.
Because it, it's under the
required test statute, it may be
required, it may, we may need to
unfortunately move where this
actually ends up in statute.
OK,
so we can adopt it, Madam Chair
Representative, I don't know
where that gets us back in.
works my concern, Madam Chair
representative is that we.
It may just go in a separate
form of law under a new section
to clarify that it's a um.
Uh, an optional test, I'm sure.
And can I ask you a quick
question. So is this already
gone through two committees.
This is the 2nd so the next step
is the floor. So if we pass this
way that is, even when it gets
to the floor, it's gonna have to
be, so should we get it reworked
before it goes to the floor,
that's kind of I'm leaning
towards too if you.
Would you like to roll the sure
Would you like to roll the that
that that is acceptable.
OK, thank you and we've taken a
lot of testimony, it would just
be to explain how the changes
were.
Oh
OK but.
Much of what we discussed like
pulse oximetry was not in the
amendment, so we have had a
partial discussion of the, the
bill, so I don't know how you
wanna deal with that, but, but
there was, there were some
questions asked that were.
Pertinent to
Mm
The bill, not the amendment. I,
we will roll it and we will do
public comment
and um then.
Come back
So is there anyone that would it
that is in opposition to this
bill.
OK. Anyone on Zoom?
You're in opposition.
OK, would you like to speak or
just?
You can keep it to one minute,
please, Madam Chair, members of
the committee. My name is Karen
Armitage. I'm a pediatrician and
a public health physician. One
of the things I want you to
think about as you consider this
bill, which is a very
well-intentioned bill, is that
any testing done on an entire
population.
Of newborns that isn't supported
by standards of science and of
careful study will sometimes
double, triple, or quadruple
referrals, and it will overwhelm
our own health care system.
Um, it may be necessary for
families to travel 100 miles or
200 miles to get the next level
of test or of newborn child.
The bill sounds like it's being
adopted, I mean, a man, it's
being.
Modified
And so if there's no requirement
to go beyond oximeter.
Then, and there's a choice that
the provider makes, I understand
the the but I wanna make sure
you understand that the costs of
mandating tests, which are not
largely widely available.
Would make it
Uh unfeasible, unaffordable, and
would block channels to
pediatric cardiologists for
children who actually heart
disease. Thank you. Um, is
there, um, anyone who'd like to
speak in support.
OK, anyone on Zoom for?
That for you.
Hi, uh, Madam Chair and
Representatives, uh, my name is
Gabriel Goglia. Um, and I am a
congenital heart defect patient.
I'm in favor of the bill based
on my own personal CHD story
that highlights a critical gap
in our health care system. As a
child in New Mexico, I was
diagnosed with a heart murmur
and it was dismissed as
innocent, something that would
go away with time, but as I grew
older, I struggled with fatigue,
shortness of breath, a constant
feeling that something wasn't
quite right, and it wasn't until
Much later in life that I
learned that I had 3 large holes
and uncounted small holes in my
heart, congenital heart defects
that had gone undetected for
many years. A stronger emphasis
on capturing a family history of
cardiovascular disease could
mean the difference between
early intervention and years of
misdiagnoses. Uh, I feel like we
need to do better, strengthening
how we assess family history,
asking the right questions,
making connections between
generational heart disease and
congenital defects. These can
lead to earlier detection and
better outcomes.
No child should grow up
questioning if their heart is
failing them or why they can't
breathe. Um, the signs are there
and we just have to pay
attention. Thank you.
If you're online and would like
to speak in favor of um this
pill. I pill 76.
Please raise your hand.
Go ahead.
My name is Karin Trujillo. I'm a
New Mexico educator, Madam Chair
and committee members.
Developmental delays in the
classroom can often be the first
sign that something isn't quite
right, as educators and
advocates, we recognize that
early diagnosis is the key to
helping students thrive.
But sometimes the issue isn't
just academic, it could be
medical. I witnessed a student
collapsing at the time, no one
knew he had an undiagnosed
congenital heart defect. His
developmental delays, difficulty
in focusing, fatigue, and slow
physical growth were dismissed
as early learning challenges,
but they were actually symptoms
of an underlying heart
condition. This experience
reinforced a powerful lesson.
Early diagnosis just isn't about
academic success.
It can be life saving. Just as
timely interventions help
children with learning delays
succeed. Early CHD detection
ensures they receive the medical
care they need. Whether in
education or healthcare early
screen and awareness gives
children the best chance to
reach their full potential.
Thank you.
3 more, OK.
One minute please.
This sir
Yes. Hello, Madam Chair, and uh
respected members of the
committee, I strongly support
this bill. I'm on, uh, of a
daughter with congenital heart
disease. I've learned firsthand
how critical it is to know and
document our family's medical
history. CHD isn't just a
condition that affects one
child.
apologize. Um, it can have
genetic links that impact future
generations. By understanding
and tracking our family's heart
health. We empower healthcare
providers with the information
they need to detect potential
risks early, leading to quicker
diagnosis and better outcomes.
When healthcare providers have a
complete family history, they
can identify patterns of heart
disease, whether it's CHD or
other cardiovascular issues.
This allows for earlier
screenings.
And testing proactive monitoring
and potentially life-saving
interventions. Many heart
conditions go undetected for
years. I was personally in the
hospital for 3 months with many,
many children that came in with
undiagnosed heart conditions.
When my daughter was
hospitalized.
Go ahead, I'm sorry. Um one
minute is up. Can you finish
your thought?
Yes, I will. Um.
It just means prioritizing a
family health as a part of a
vital um part of routine care is
what I'm asking for. Thank you.
Thank you. Next.
Haman?
Hello, Madam Chair.
Uh, vice chair, members of the
committee, sponsors, and
advocates, members of the
audience. My name is Nat Dean.
I'm a disability advocate. I'm
not a lobbyist. I'm also a
person with multiple
disabilities, and I, uh, will be
brief and stating that I do
support this bill because the
more early, sorry, the more
early. It's like, it's more
late, so, uh, the earlier that
we are able to identify
that were early interventional
strategies to promote a higher
quality and quantity of life
make a huge difference, not only
for the child, the, the infant,
the child, their siblings, their
mother, father, their
multigenerational household or
even for someone who's adopting
a newborn, the more that you
know, the more there is that we
can do and sometimes we may
learn something now much later
in life, that impacted the
quality of.
our life as we went through it
just by not knowing something
that existed when we were just
uh barely an infant. Thank you
so much to the sponsors, to the
family that told their stories
and to the committee for
considering, um, bringing this
forward. Thank you very much.
April
Good evening, Madam Chair and
committee members. My name is
April Louis Ramirez. I'm a
licensed professional clinical
counselor here in Albuquerque,
New Mexico. I am also the
president of the New Mexico
Association for Play Therapy, as
I want to sit here and support
the bill. I also want to talk
about both the professional
level and my own personal
experience. As a child, I was
felt with doubt, anxiety,
misunderstandings, and when I
turned into my twenties
26 I was diagnosed with a heart
condition of uh PSVT. I, one
year later went down and had
surgery with years of feeling.
Mistrust in the system, um, no
validation, suffering from
anxiety, being told it was
anxiety my whole life and me
feeling like I was having heart
problems my whole life. I have
family members. My great uncles,
my mom has been on heart
monitors her whole life, as well
as my great uncle passed and my
great grandfather passed. Um, my
cousin recently just had a
stroke and got diagnosed with
CHD. He had 3 holes in his
heart, and
the mental health um aspect of
this, if we can catch these at
an early age, diagnoses at an
early age and in the newborn. We
can catch these early to prevent
adverse child experiences,
stress and get get ahead on
mental health, get children into
play therapy. We can get ahead
on all of this so that we can
move forward with a better
understanding and help the
mental health of all
individuals, family members.
and the children.
Thank you.
OK, one more.
One minute, please.
Kelly
Hi, my name is Doctor Kelly
Williams Page. I have worked in
education for 32 years and I
have a PhD in teaching, learning
and teacher education. And I am
speaking in support of this
bill. Just as early diagnosis is
critical for congenital heart to
ensure timely treatment and
better long-term outcomes. The
same principle applies to
developmental delays in the
classroom. When a child has an
undiagnosed heart defect. It can
impact their energy levels,
function
and overall well-being, making
it harder for
to keep up with their peers.
Similarly, when a developmental
delay goes unnoticed, students
may struggle academically,
socially and emotionally,
creating barriers to their
success. Early diagnosis for
targeted infections, whether
it's a medical treatment for CHD
or specialized educational
support for development for
developmental delays, a child
with identified heart that can
receive proper care just as a
student with a learning
challenge can benefit from
speech therapy, occupational
therapy, or IEP.
In both cases, the earlier we
recognize the issue, the better
the outcome.
Delaying diagnosis, whether for
CHD or other developmental
delays means delay necessary
support, leading to unnecessary
struggles, but with early
detection, we give children the
best chance to grow, learn, and
thrive. Every child deserves the
opportunity to reach their full
potential and early intervention
makes all the difference.
Thank you.
OK, so we've gotten, would you
like to close?
Yes, ma'am, actually, it's not a
close, it's kind of a backup and
so.
What, what we are mandating what
we are attempting to mandate is
getting the family history by
asking these questions. We are
not mandating the the further
treatment, so, so there is a
man, I, I don't know if I'm
confusing you more, um, but the
mandate is that will be part of
the uh what are these called?
um prenatal, not prenatal.
Newborn infants, so.
The requirement will be that the
provider take a good family
history of cardiac and then the,
the decision about what to do
with the findings is left with
the provider. So there is a
required part which makes, which
makes it fall under the section
of the law.
But the, what they do after the
family history is left of that.
Didn't confuse you.
Uh, we have another question
Representative B block. Thank
you so much, Madam Chair. OK,
so,
I, I get it. I get what you're
saying the required tests or
required information, but the
way I'm reading the
The 1st 3 lines of the bill, it
says adding echocardiograms and
electrocardiograms to the
required tests for newborn
infants. So that's still there.
And so Madam Chair
Representative, I guess maybe we
could change that language to
something like adding
Required information for tests,
something like that.
Is it still says required for
echocardiograms and
electrocardiograms,
I, I agree with that, Madam
Chair, but I'm saying it doesn't
need to be moved, so it may not,
it will not be as much of an
amendment as it had previously
appeared, it will just be
striking that and maybe adding
um.
Complete family history of
cardiac disease or something,
you know, whatever the right
terminology is, so just, just
kind of a.
A forewarning that it will not
be have to be moved to another
section of law, can stay in the
section of law with just a few
tweaks.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair,
cleared it up. And um, my
understanding is you still would
like it to be rolled.
Madam Chair, I will uh go with
the will of the committee.
But we really want this to move
and it is. So if you are asking
for another amendment or the
amendment you're saying is
complete. No, Madam Chair, I
would like the amendment that we
have.
adopted.
And then perhaps do a substitute
bill on the floor with those
other minor changes that we need
to make.
So you don't want to roll.
Whatever the committee decides,
I will abide by, of course.
Representatives.
I don't know how the the rules
state, but isn't the.
sponsor of the bill, the one who
has already to roll it.
Unless we, unless the chair,
unless we reschedule for another
time. So I just want to make
clear who, who's who's the
person who makes that decision,
I don't thank you
representative, I think the
question is that.
It is, it's probably easier for
you to roll it, fix it, because
it's gonna be harder to do a a
sub on the floor.
Madam chair, we will roll it and
we will do a sub instead of.
Um, making more amendments
because it is pretty confusing,
so we will, we will do a
substitute bill with the with
the changes that we that I
presented today as well as with
the changes to the language
about the required test
just real quick I just if you
get it cleaned up it should if
you're gonna.
Get this in the house, we like
to the floor, we like to see it
nice and cleaned up, and I think
that could be done pretty
quickly. We'll just add it to a
Saturday. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Yeah, we have nothing else to do
on Saturdays.
Yeah, or Sunday we're gonna be
having to do, OK, um, thank you,
thank you, and I'm glad we got
the.
Testimony and public comment,
OK the family on their way.
Thank you, madam Zamora for
being so patient, um, well next
year house bill 154, the bingo
and Raffle act exemptions.
OK, Representative, whenever
you're ready.
I think we've heard this bill
before, right?
Whenever you're ready.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee.
It's been a long day.
So House Bill 154 relating to
Raffles exempting from the New
Mexico bingo and Raffala Raffles
for fundraising.
Purposes held by tax-exempt
services, educational.
Athletic or extracurricular
organizations.
That primarily serve youth.
Who are under 18 years or 18
years of age and younger.
Madam Chair, if, if you'll
allow uh my expert witnesses to
introduce themselves. Go ahead.
My name is Pat Garrett. I'm the
chairman of the gaming control
board.
Madam Chair members of the
committee. My name is Michelle
Pedo. Thank you.
And Madam Chair with that we'll
stand questions.
Thank you all, um, if we have
anybody in the audience who is
in support of the legislation
we're on House Bill 154.
You could raise your hand.
Anyone in opposition?
OK. Um, let me check and see if
we have anybody in support
online, do we have anyone on
support online?
OK, sir,
go ahead and
I haven't had a nap today.
I'll, I'll see, I'll see if I
can string a couple of sentences
together, um, Madam Chair.
The committee members, I'm
Doctor Guy Clark. I'm chairman
for Stop Predatory Gambling in
New Mexico.
Uh, we're opposed to this bill.
Actually, I'm gonna confuse it a
little bit more. There are
actually 3 issues with this
bill.
Uh, Although
The language in the bill is so
muddy, it's hard to, hard to
make your way through it, it
seems to be saying it wants to
legalize.
Uh, raffle or bingo gambling in
schools, public schools, private
very vague about a lot of
things.
But that's
That's what I can piece together
out of part of.
Uh, part of this bill would
legalize gambling in schools.
OK, and it, it gets a little bit
more complicated than that.
Uh, it doesn't spell out who
runs it. It doesn't say if a
private entity, a corporation or
whether it's run by the school.
If it's run by the school, this
is opening a whole new can of
worms, uh, because,
uh
finish your thought.
a comment. I'm sorry.
I really need to say a lot more,
I haven't talked about uh uh
gambling, um.
Uh
I haven't talked about affecting
the youth.
I understand, sir, and, and, and
like you, it's been a very long
day, so we're, we're just trying
to get to discussion if, if you
have anything that you can share
to the committee, um.
We can, we can pose some of
those questions, um, certainly
during debate. you really want
to pass over why it might be a
state
state-run thing that you, you
have any facility for it in the
audience in opposition.
No, what is there anyone online?
OK. We'll go ahead and go to the
committee, um.
Representative Block.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative and
experts for being here today.
So,
I have some questions on this.
I guess I'll just start.
Wherever the new language
starts, Madam Chair.
On page
To
Sorry, I just needed to fold my
paper and not hit the microphone
and make everyone.
temporarily without hearing for
a while. So, Madam Chair
Representative, OK, so,
I see here
talks about raffles shall be
construed to apply to a raffle
held for fundraising purposes.
So by a service educational
athletic or extracurricular
organizations. So, Madam Chair
Representative, so
This applies to
Maybe
If my local high school was
having a raffle.
They currently are not allowed
to have a raffle for the high
school athletics team, but this
would allow them to to raise
money for, for their athletics
in that school. Is that correct,
Madam Chair Representative
Zamora experts.
Madam Chair, if, if you'll
allow, I'll let my expert
witnesses answer the questions.
Thank you.
Madam Chair Representative, and
that is correct. That is.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. So this wouldn't
allow just like any teacher to
just say, you know, well, well,
I got kids that are under 18.
I'm teaching.
Let's have a raffle for let's
let's, let's start gambling in
in 3rd grade classroom.
I'm sorry.
That's not what it's gonna
allow, Madam Chair, is that
correct?
Madam Chair, Representative, um,
that is correct. The point of
this to go on trips and things
like that.
OK. And so I, I guess, madam
chair, I guess, so
extracurricular organizations
that could be any kind of club,
like uh
The the student government
association or a chess club or
any kind of
Like school sponsored.
Extracurricular activity, which
I would assume would be tied to
education. So that would apply
to those as well, Madam Chair,
Representative Zamora.
Madam Chair Representative, yes,
that would. This is inits
whether it's academics, sports,
educational, um, soaps as well.
OK. Thank you, Madam Chair. And
I guess I, I just had a question
about that. I was thinking about
it. If there was a high school
that was in the state, but they
also offered GED.
Programs for folks who are
already 18. Does the current law
allow these nonprofits to do
that for folks who are over 18,
and how does that work with this
bill, Madam Chair
Representative.
Madam chair, um, uses the phrase
primarily serves youth who are
18 years of age and younger. Um,
so we recognize that some of
there are many sports clubs,
educational.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair and
representative that, that helps.
And then I
I've neglected to look at the
statute, whatever NMSA.
7-2-4.
Or subsection C of 7-2A-4. What
nonprofits are, are included in
there, Madam Chap
representative, is it just C3s
or is it also uh
Other nonprofits, Madam Chair.
I apologize, I do not have that
and can get that for you though.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair.
Yeah, I just know there's all
kinds of different cool
Tax structures and I just don't
want to exclude anybody, but it
sounds like it's pretty, pretty
inclusive.
If it's going throughout section
B to Section C, so I guess it's
probably a C3 and
We just did C3, maybe. I don't
know. OK, I'll, I'll look into
that. Thank you so much, Madam
Chair, representatives.
And
in
I guess it also says 18.
And the younger, so I guess
technically this could also
apply if there was a like a PTA.
As well, cause I know it's not
technically directly with the
school, but it's like an
organization. Would that apply
if the PTA was for a preschool
or something, and I'm sure.
Madam Chair Representative, um,
yes, that would apply to like,
um, primarily serving youth.
OK, great. So I'm glad it's it's
inclusive, that helps a lot. And
then does, does this establish
any like monetary limit on the
prize amounts.
I'm sure.
OK, good. I'm glad.
Because I'd love to win a
million dollars at the.
The chess club raffle or
whatever, so that's, that's
helpful man I'm sure. I don't
know what high school would have
a million dollars prize, but.
I'd want to be included in that,
so, OK, Madam Chair,
Representative, and I would
definitely probably go there and
support their athletics team.
They're probably pretty good,
so.
Madam Chair Representative. And
then I guess I was looking at
the analysis and the gaming
control board, it said that it
didn't have a necessary
necessary fiscal impact.
On the general fund said it
would be minimal.
And I'm guessing that's because
these organizations weren't
paying taxes previously. So I'm
guessing, do we know how much we
can expect in taxes with these
new uh newly allowed uh.
Aiming
activities, Madam Chair.
Representative.
Madam Chair, I'm Representative,
um, so,
We don't really have as largely
we haven't known about many of
them, um, to us, and, um,
really.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm sure
it'd be bad PR you banging down
the doors of a
a grade school. How dare you
raise money for kids.
Track or something. So, that
makes sense. So, Madam Chair,
representatives, uh,
representatives.
Ma, I'm sure, I, I believe it
says.
The bill does not clearly define
what qualifies as a service,
educational, athletic, or
extracurricular organization
leaving room for interpretation
and potential abuse, Madam Chair
Representative, do you have any
concerns about that? I think
from what I read seems pretty
clear, but do you guys have any
concerns about it being
Not clear in those definitions,
I'm sure.
Madam Chair Representative, um,
we are not concerned about that,
um.
We subject to that at some
point, but.
OK, great. And then, Madam
Chair, I
Are you guys requesting
additional help with the gaming
control board.
To have more enforcement
mechanisms. I'm sure every high
school in the world is gonna
want to do this. I mean, if I
had, if I was a principal of
high school, I'd say, yeah, this
would be great for our
extracurriculars. So is this
gonna include more oversight,
regulation and enforcement,
bless you, uh, with this, would
this include any more of that?
And is that already factored
into your budget request, Madam
Chair.
Madam Chair Representative, um,
because we would no longer be
regulating.
OK, great. That's, that's even
better. I think that's another
reason to support this. Thank
you.
Madam Chair Representative, and
then continuing here.
I know the current threshold on
something that was right before
the changed language on page
two, it was 75,000.
No raffle.
Regarding that. So, so this one
doesn't have a cap.
What is the one beforehand?
On this section on B, page 2,
line 11.
What 11 to 13. What does that
pertain to? Just so I have
clarity, Madam Chair,
Representative.
Um, this does provide a cap
that, um, any raffles, um, done
about it.
Perfect. OK, thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you,
Representative, and, uh, that
helps.
And then I, I like the idea of
the youth under 18, but not, not
specifically.
The stringent definition,
because especially with those
GED programs in high schools,
etc. They may also be included
in that. So,
Madam Chair Representative. I, I
don't know if you guys done a
cost study or some kind of a
I don't know, financial
Forecasting or what this could
bring in. Do we think it's
significant in any way, or do
you think it could maybe be
reduced.
Uh, the, the number of
Revenue dollars reduced.
Is it, do you expect high or
lower?
Madam Chair, representative,
um, we do not.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative. That,
that helps me a lot. I'm still
looking at some of these.
analyses, but I think that that
could be maybe the potential end
of my questioning, although
I think there are more questions
to be answered. Let me, let me
just look at my questions real
quick, madam chair.
I know it's a lot of words to
say.
I'm, I'm buffering.
OK, got it. OK. Next year, so
are there any mechanisms for
verifying that exempted Raffles
are truly for nonprofit youth
organizations because Madam
Chair Representative, I guess
you could technically have a
have a nonprofit say, well, well
we have a youth initiative and
it could technically have one
little portion of their budget,
but they spend like
1% of the budget on that. Has
that been considered and could
you just address that,
Madam Chair,
um, we did not specifically
address that in here, um.
I, the, the language primary.
OK, got it. So primary, I would
say 50% or more, or 51%.
As long as it's the majority of
what they do. OK, that makes
sense to me. Thank you, Madam
Chair, and I think that helps
me, and I, I'll listen to the
debate and continue listening,
but uh.
Seems like a positive change,
and I think this could, this
could be helpful for our high
schools or or just schools in
general and institutions of
higher learning to help is
Yeah.
Out of 501st in education, like
we always hear, and I think this
could actually be beneficial if
there are more dollars going to
these extracurricular
activities, I think it.
Could potentially be
A very positive outcome. So
that's all I had, man. I'm sure.
Thank you so much for the
answers and, and, uh.
Appreciate it.
Thank you, Representative.
Thank you. Thank you, Madam, so
we got hungry and just stepped
out and apologize and Apple came
back.
Uh, I just have a few simple
questions, hopefully simple.
Um
So I'm gonna give you scenario
and then tell me.
Cause I did, I missed some of
it. I apologize. Hope this be
simple.
So
Currently, what we have right
now, we're not changing this on
page 2.
On line 11, notwithstanding the
provisions of Section A, Section
no raffle with the individual
prize exceeding $75,000 should
be held without a tender 10 day
prior notification.
So I'm assuming what that means
is if you're raffling in a car.
Two motorcycles or something,
anything over $75,000 and that
has to go.
10 day prior notification.
to the board, right? OK, so
that's staying the same.
My that.
And then what we're adding is
nothing New Mexico bingo Act
with regard to Raffles shall be
construed to apply to raffle
held for fundraising purposes.
By service educational athletic
or sorry.
I choked earlier, Madam Chair
representing, because we was
talking about 3 year olds
gambling or something. I can't
get over that or whatever.
Um
So if it does that mean?
Let's say there's a car club.
And there's some kids that are
under 18.
They can't
This would
They can't apply, this wouldn't
be applied because they're under
18 in a car club and let's say
somebody's raffling off a car
and they're just raising money
for the car club. They're their
youth.
Say you so bad.
But it's not for educated
athletic, but what about
extracurricular, so it's all
tied into school, is that what
I'm understanding, ma'am?
An expert
Madam Chair Representative, um,
no, this is not just tied to
schools or youth groups,
primarily serving
representative.
Is there some cause I actually
know there's a lot of youth
groups out there that aren't
official groups that do things
for fundraising. So do they have
to register or something if
they're under 18 to say that
they're going to be.
Doing raffle tickets cause I
know.
For us as legislators, we cannot
do.
Raffle tickets, but we could do
an auction.
So if I have a, a group of
youths.
From a car club they're auction
off a car. How does this, how
would all this change apply to
them and Madam Chair
Representative, um, if that is
an organization that we're, um,
the bingo.
So my remors so what they have
to do this 10 day prior
notification because if it was a
car and it was over 75,000, is
that exempt them for that or
they still, I'm asking you for
legit questions, actually, no
kids and young people that do
raffles to make money and
sometimes there are big things,
usually not, it's usually
smaller, but if I have a group
of kids who are under 18.
They're like the junior member
of Sigla Reva Car Club.
And they want to raffle up a
car. Do they still have to do
this 10 day notification.
They do not. OK, so they're then
exempt from that. Yes, because
of what they're doing. OK. And
is there any definition, Madam
Char Representative.
Youth groups can be loosely
based or does it have to be like
an official title.
I don't know if that's making
sense. Like, does it have to be
the our Club of America Junior
auxiliary members, or can it
just be the youth, the kids that
are trying to raise money for
maybe that.
and
Madam Chair Representative, um,
no, there is not a definite OK.
Man, I think that's all the
questions I have, and that was a
legit question because I knew,
you know, kids in the community
that do raffles sometimes large
scale, and I know that.
People always get like I'm in
the American Legion, you know,
making sure you're not profit
doing these things, that'll hem
you up.
Mm I think that's all I had on
this. Thank you, representative.
Experts, thank you.
Representative Thompson.
Thank you, Madam Chair, thank
you, um.
Presenters and experts.
So
I'm reading one of the analysis
and it says the lack of a cap on
fundraiser winnings leaves the
possibility for a windfall of
winnings that becomes
unaccounted for general fund
revenue. Could you please
address that?
I'm not even sure what it means.
I'm not sure I, um,
I'm not even sure what it means.
I'm not sure I mean um
because this would be.
No, I mean
The the cap doesn't really tell
you how much, um, raffle. There
are raffles that can happen by
qualified organizations dollars
and 1 per quarter and those are
things organization conducted.
Um, that isn't seen.
So Madam Chair and uh
representative and expert.
So that that brings up another
question in terms of paying
taxes on it if no one knows
who's won it.
Or how much it was or any of
those things. How does that?
Interplay with the state and
federal taxes.
Madam Chair Representative, um,
individuals are, are some
raffles out there under the as
well. And it is our enterprises.
We understand that that's a
possibility.
Um, but that Madam Chair, would
you consider putting a cap on
it, I mean, because we haven't
seen it, it um.
This is totally out of my area
of expertise, but
Could it be that someone says,
ah, there's no cap and you know,
like I said, this gaming stuff
is so is that just, just a
suggestion that that may be
something to make it more
palatable for folks, and then uh
another thing is that um it it
appears to exempt fundraising
raffles for service,
educational, athletic or other
extracurricular activities.
However, there are no
definitions provided for
service, educational, athletic
or or.
Other extracurricular
activities.
And educational was.
Organization is defined
elsewhere in the New Mexico
bingo and rap bingo and raffle
act which could prove
duplicative or confusing. So I'm
just putting those out there for
you to consider. I, I don't know
if I understand an answer if you
gave it to me, but those were
some of the concerns that were
raised, so just something to
think about as you move this
bill forward. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Real
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, representatives
representative and experts, I
just have.
Uh, a question regarding um
right now when.
So what's the difference
between?
schools that are currently
fundraising for sports and this.
Madam Chair Representative, this
is intended, um, we've, we've
had those. Thank you. So then
there are schools around the
state that are.
Actively not.
Supposed to is is that how I'm
hearing it? That's correct. OK.
All right. And so this is just
ensuring that from here on out.
They can
Fundraise, but they will be
doing it in a way that's um.
I guess legal.
Um the, the, the, and, and I
guess I'm with uh representative
Thompson as well around the cap
that I think the cap would be
important, um, I know that
there's differences in how
people or how entities fundraise
and so, um, I think in terms of
that.
Would be, would be important and
then um.
And I think that's that's the
end of my questions. Thank you.
OK.
OK, just a minute.
Representative block.
I was just gonna move a
do.
Representative Romero was that.
We have emotion, is there a
second?
Or
OK. Thank you. Did I missed that
one.
OK, um,
Is there uh
Any opposition
Um
I don't need to take room.
You have
Pass, um.
With unanimous
uh consent from 6 to 0 on House
Bill 154.
Let's see, are the sponsor.
Uh, Representative Mason.
Maybe they decided to wear it.
Um, this is for House Bill 162.
Going once.
Oh, OK.
Represented Mason.
And if we could keep the um
discussion um.
To the um
To the bill itself. OK.
Go ahead.
Thank you Madam chair committee.
Thank you for allowing me to
bring this.
Legislation forward today, HB
162.
It is a bell to repeal.
7-day waiting period for the
sale of a firearm.
Which is the handout that he
gave you is the.
The wording of the bill that
This repeal it uh.
Bill original bill was the
unlawful sale of a firearm
before required waiting period
ends.
7 calendar days.
Making it a misdemeanor.
Have others say that first of
all I'd like to introduce my
expert witnesses.
Uh, I have shooting sports.
Association, Anthony Segura.
And Nick
Lucio, the National Rifle
Association.
Reginald, I can, I'll start with
uh.
By expert witness has a
statement on.
Thank you Madam chair.
Madam Chair, committee, again,
my name is Anthony Suguro. I'm
with the New Mexico Shooting
Sports Association. I also
represent the New Mexico
firearms Industry Association.
And
I've got a brief statement to
talk about.
What's going on with this, with
this bill?
Uh, the reason that we're asking
if it could be uh repealed is
that well,
There's, there's a lot of things
that are going wrong with it.
The main thing is that, you
know, when, when a background
check is submitted.
90% of them go through
perfectly, they go through right
away.
The problem is that there's
nothing else done except the FFL
needs to store the rifle or
pistol.
And continue to do so for 7
days. Nothing else is gonna come
back and say whether it's if
it's already have if they have a
proceed, it's gone through.
Um
The problem is that a lot of
these gun stores, they're small
stores, they don't have the room
to store.
Additional rifles or pistols or
whatever because.
They, they were never planning
for it.
Um
So what they have to do is they
either have to find a place to
store the guns or pay to
Um, expand their, their business
so it's costing them a lot of
money to do that.
The other thing is that um,
There's a, there's a lot more
documentation that has to be
done. So they fill out the
paperwork for an for uh ATF
background check.
And then once they come back,
they have to fill the paperwork
out again so that they have to
pay an employee.
Twice to do the job.
So it costs the FFL dealer and
like I said a lot of them were
just small mom and pop stores
that can't afford to have
additional employees, so it's
costing them a lot of money to
do it.
And then a lot of this, a lot of
since New Mexico is such a wide,
you know, state.
A lot of times, somebody will
come, maybe 2 hours to a store
and then they have to wait
another 7 days.
And come back again, so that
costs the consumer.
A lot of money because they have
to make two trips, so I, I.
I want you to think about that.
And then the other part is
there's a lot of confusion on
this bill. I've done transfers
in different cities.
There is no guide from DPS.
I have an actual copy of a
letter.
That was sent to the DPS.
And
They have gotten no response
back from Secretary Bowie.
And this is the 2nd letter that
was sent to them with no
response, asking them for
detailed information on how this
bill is supposed to be
implemented.
And nobody has gotten back to
these gun stores. So they're
making it up on the fly.
There should be instructions
saying how it's supposed to be
done and it's not being done.
So
That's why
This bill should be repealed.
Because it doesn't do any good.
As a matter of fact, in the last
couple of weeks, there was a
gentleman that went into a gun
store in Albuquerque, purchased
a gun, waited the 7 days, and
unfortunately he went home,
committed suicide, but before he
committed suicide, he killed his
family.
So this bill does nothing.
Since the background check is
done immediately.
What is the 7 day waiting period
really do?
Thank you.
Thank you, and we are trying,
uh, we have
One more bill after this and so.
Thank you, Madam Gerard, we
realized that we also realized
that we got.
I should have been up
2 hours ago, you change, you
know, so, you know, it, uh.
We've waited so.
It, uh, we'll get through it as
quick as we can. I would like
also.
Uh
For my other expert witness.
Nick, this he is with the
National Rifle Association.
The regional manager.
if you'd like to say a word.
Madam Chair, committee members,
good evening. My name is Nick
Tuccio. I serve as the state
director of the National Rifle
Association in New Mexico. I'm
here today to express our strong
support for House Bill 162.
The existing waiting period
imposes an unnecessary delay on
law abiding citizens who wish to
exercise their 2nd Amendment
rights.
After passing the required
background checks, these
individuals should not face
additional burdens hurdles to
obtain a firearm.
We urge you to support House
Bill 162 to uphold
constitutional rights of New
Mexico citizens and to remove
unnecessary barriers for those
who follow the law.
Thank you for your
consideration.
Madam Chair committee
I have another statement or two
I'd like to make before we.
Get on with this
I would like to point out that
HB 129, which is the bill we're
repla.
Trying to repeal does not deny
the legal purchase of that is
legally.
Able to purchase that firm it
only is stated.
Only prolongs the time between
the time of purchase and
delivery.
You know, by federal law
everyone fills out.
A federal next background check.
Yeah
Time frame does not give them
more time to.
Beckham further
This
is
wait when the NFL.
FFL puts in the information it
automatically runs it.
Does it then?
As an FFL we get 23 responses.
As he stated, which is 98% of
the time.
They also have a uh a delay
process in the federal law.
Which is a 3 day wait.
response.
Which doesn't matter, you know,
I, I do believe that.
7 day waiting period is unfair
to our thousands of law-abiding.
Citizens who are legal gun
owners.
And ours New Mexico small
business FFLs whose business it
is to transfer and sell legal
firearms to legal.
Fis. It's just an extra burden
on both our citizens and our
business doesn't change the the
process at all just delays it
one.
Thought of mine
There's people in the city's
next on our borders like of New
Mexico.
Like, say, Hobbs, New Mexico.
A citizen there can drive to
Seminole, Texas.
By a long gun and bring it and.
Get it. He's gone an hour, hour
and a half.
So he's denying the FFL.
In New Mexico, the revenue the
state of New Mexico the taxes.
And putting the burden on both
the citizen and
And the
And the FFL.
In Sunland Park, New Mexico.
El Paso, it's 9 miles.
You can drive
From Sunland Park, El Paso by a
gun.
98% of the time immediately put
it in your pickup.
Drive back to Las Cruces.
I told New Mexico to Trinidad
22.
So in my way of thinking, this
bill.
Only puts a burden on.
As we've stated numerous times
already.
The law-abiding citizens.
The legal
Businesses the state of New
Mexico.
That make their living.
Pay their taxes
Selling firearms to legal.
The legal citizen.
Thank you Madam Chair.
Committee for allowing us
This time my only wish is to.
That you the chair and as the
committee.
We all the the facts on this
case.
Before
Before you before you vote
today.
And do what you think you're.
Citizens of your districts would
like.
Thank you. We'll go to the
audience. Is there anyone in
opposition to this.
Um
Good evening. Yes, good evening,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee. This is Kurt Reker.
I'm the director of Lutheran
Advocacy Ministries of New
Mexico. Do we speak for the
conference of churches as well.
And we're here to speak against
HB 16862. Guns are the most
lethal method used for self-harm
and the fatality rate of 90 90%
waiting periods have proven to
save lives, data supports that
waiting periods reduce gun
violence and suicides in the
interests of public health,
let's not go
backwards. I urge you to oppose
HD 162, 7 days of a reasonable
period to wait. Thank you.
Thank you. Next.
Yes, man.
My name is John Folston. I'm the
district 7 director for MEco
Shooting Sports Association.
Uh, I'm not gonna repeat what
the three gentlemen have already
said, but I do wanna add
Again, the statistics, the
gentleman just quoted are not
accurate. If you look at the
statistics, there's not any real
evidence that shows these
waiting periods do any good.
Again, this bill affects
law-abiding citizens.
I, I, as a, as a law abiding
citizens should not have to go
through a double effort to buy a
gun. I go to the store and I
fill out a 4473 and get an FBI
check.
They have cleared me. I'm also
concealed carry perme. I've been
cleared. I posed no threat to
anybody. This bill does
absolutely nothing, nothing at
all to prevent crime.
All it does is it affects me and
my ability to exercise my rights
in New Mexico.
As I have said before, I wish we
could concentrate on real bills
that would really prevent crime
and really do some good instead
of continuously
Picking on law-abiding citizens
such as myself. Thank you.
Is there anyone else
OK, so we switched to um
support.
Um, is there anyone in the
audience who supports this pill?
So is there anything else you'd
like to close with before we go
to the committee?
Oh.
OK, there are more people on
Zoom.
OK
In favor. Oh, I'm sorry.
OK, um, how many?
OK, go ahead.
One minute.
Good evening, Madam Chair. It's
Larry Sontag here. I'm
representing myself as a legal
gun owner.
And I appreciate that bill
sponsor Representative Mason, he
articulated the reasons to
support this well and the other
two expert witnesses. I won't
repeat what they've said, but I
do want to relay my experience
as a twenty-year law enforcement
officer with the Albuquerque
Police Department. I contacted a
lot of victims during that time
period.
And there are circumstances
where women in particular are
scared to death and don't know
what to do.
Telling them
They need to wait 7 days to have
a firearm which they're legally
able to buy is unacceptable.
There's a recent example where
somebody from prison called his
ex-girlfriend and said, I will
kill you when I get out. He did
that.
And I just encourage you to
listen to the expert witnesses
and also to question how many
lives have been saved by the 7
day waiting period, and on the
other hand, how many innocent
victims have we put in harm's
danger because of the waiting
period.
Thank you.
One more and um.
One minute, please.
Sharon, did you wish to speak
unmute yourself.
OK, we'll just go on. Thank you.
Um
Uh
I'm sure.
Yes, we have a list.
Representative Lord and.
If we can make it.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. It will be
direct because it has to do with
this bill that we're repealing,
otherwise I'd just have to say,
why do you want to repeal, but
we're gonna go through why.
We want to repeal that.
So, let's go through a few
things.
So, when you fill out the 4773
form.
There are questions are asked
when you purchase, when you're a
lawful gun owner and you walk
into a store and you feel the
sound, it asks you questions.
You want to make sure you're not
doing a straw purchase.
Uh, they want to know if you're
a felon.
They want to know if you've ever
been convicted in court,
including
court of Representative, yeah,
it does ties in. This is all,
this is everything this is based
on.
And this has to do with
repealing all of that, so if you
can make it to that, right, but
it has to do with why we're
doing the 7 day wait.
Tie it right in. Hold on. So
there's a bunch of questions
here on the 4773.
That do an extensive background,
cause this is what we're talking
about, right? This is a 7 day
waiting period for a background
check.
There are plenty of questions.
Have you been mentally in mental
institution, if you've been
dishonor discharged? Are you
addicted to drugs?
There are numerous things.
On this background check as
we're waiting on a background
check.
Would you agree that that is
true, Madam Chair and
represents. We're waiting on a
background check.
Madam Chair Representative.
Actually, I do not.
Completely agree with that. The
background check whether you
wait 7 days or 10 minutes I'm
gonna ask you more questions
about that. OK, so hold on.
So hold on while I walk you
through it. So we're waiting on
a background check, supposedly
OK, so Maure representative,
what happens when you walk into
the store, you fill this out.
Are you lawfully a citizen, um,
do you intend to dispose of
this? What, you know, is this a
straw purchase? Have you been
renounced a United States
citizenship that all these
questions are asked in detail.
Are you a felon? Can you have a
firearm, right? Those are asked.
When it gets sent to Nick's.
And it goes immediately through
sometimes it does, and that is
proceed to go ahead and sell
that farm. Is that correct?
Madam Chair represented, yes,
that is correct. OK.
So all of these questions are
asked in detail about whether a
lawful person should be able to
purchase firearms.
It goes to the Nick system. It
comes back automatically and it
says proceed.
OK.
But we can't do that any longer.
We have to wait for 7 days.
Some of the options of the
answers when somebody fills this
out.
Can also be a deny. Is that
correct, Madam Chair and
Representative?
Uh, yes, as I stated, there's 3
responses.
Proceed, which is like 98% of
the time.
Delight which the federal law
has.
Impose a 3 day waiting period.
And then
As the
But, uh, representative stated
denied.
So.
9
Right
Most of the time
Right, Madam Chair though and
represent there can also be
issues with that if your name is
a very common name like Joseph
Smith.
That could come back and you
could actually get it denying
that based on just your name. Is
that correct, madam?
Uh, madam, yes.
It, it is an appeal process.
Where you have to go
Directly to the next program
um this has to do everything I
don't wanna hear about the
process. I just want to hear
what's being repealed and if
it's not in this, and I'm sure
it does, it actually goes in
with this, so after that,
there's an open period because
we're gonna talk about this now
we're not talking about the
rules of our house, which we've
adopted,
no member shall be interrupted
when speaking, nor shall any
motion be in order until such a
member
I did not interrupt. She kept on
and I am going to make it so
that we keep on that we are
talking about the momentum chair
I did not interrupt. She kept on
and I am going to make it so
that we keep on that we are
talking about the momentum
chairs
so we go through this process of
a set recurrently before the 7th
day.
We enacted the seven-day
process.
What happens in the NIC systems
while they're waiting for 7 days
because I know what happens,
nothing.
Would you like to expound on
that talk about how nothing
happens during that seven-day
wait period through the NIC
system, Me representative
representative,
this
is on process
about
we are not about the 7 day, why
do we have this billman chair?
Because we're supposed to do
more extensive background check.
There's supposed to be something
happening. My point is nothing
is happening. Is that correct?
Nothing happens?
that's true that the background
check goes through.
Same amount of time whether you
wait.
7, 14 days, the only provision
which.
I did
In the in the bill now.
You have you get it immediately.
But, uh, and that is in this
book.
that what I was trying to tie
into this whole bill is based on
the 7 days thinking there's
gonna be more of a background
check.
There isn't.
Nothing happens. It just does 7
days.
So, Madam Chair and
representative, um.
I had some questions, so.
With the FFL, Madam Chair
Representative, because if we
can't talk about the bill, the
bill is supposed to be for
cooling off period, and the bill
is supposed to be doing more
background check, and it does
neither.
Some an aspect, Ma'am chair
ribsam experts.
Um
There is no evidence that the
waiting period does anything as
far as suicides, homicides, and
mass shootings. There's no
studies.
That will quantify that this
bill has any effect on. So are
you familiar with that study?
There are
I did
some research on that and all of
the surveys I saw all include
the words.
Bye
Or can, but no.
That
Lives saved
by introducing any of
representative actually when I
did some studies, I found some
conflicting that said that it
actually reduces. There's a
study that was done that.
Uh, it will not.
Make a difference on those, but
it actually has had instances.
Where it has done the opposite.
So
Madam Chair and Representative,
so this bill again was to go
back to make sure there's more
background check, there's not.
There's no study that shows that
it does anything.
It also shows that the NIC
system does not do any further
testing.
Um, Madam Chair and
Representative.
When we go and this is, I, I.
love
Jason Bowie, but we have had
some problem because the FFLs
have told me.
Madam Chair Representative that
they can't get a clear answer.
So I guess my question would be
what is the answer because when
I go to the DPS website, it says
you should speak to a lawyer.
If there are no guidelines for
it.
And it says,
That it happens on calendar
days, Ma representative, do the
FFLs know when that day starts?
Is it when they start looking in
the next system is when they get
the reply later that day. Is it
right at the exact time that
they do.
The Knick's background check,
when does it start and when does
it end? because there's no
clarification on this 7 day wait
period.
Madam Chair Representative.
That is true, as he stated.
We have
As if it feels no direct.
Recommendations on how this
works. I know several FFLs and I
have one also.
And RFFL we do.
You come in at 11:05 on Saturday
you're eligible to pick the gun
up after.
That's our
Representative, um, yeah, I'm
trying to avoid the process and
just what the actual bill is
going to do.
I, I believe I was, I, I
believed I was just answering a
question.
That shouldn't have been asked
and Madam Chair, what would you
like me to ask on this? Because
we're saying we're getting rid
of this, but you don't want to
go through the process of what
the 7 day does. So what would
you like me to ask? What are the
questions that are OK to ask
because if it was it's not a
Republican bill we would have
all the opportunity in the
world, but it is. So what would
you like me to ask because
you're not allowing me to ask
the bill that affects our
citizens of New Mexico. So
please tell me what I'm allowed
to ask.
As if the 7 day is being
repealed.
Are you kidding me? I do, um,
manager representative, it's a 7
day waiting period being
repelled?
Can you expound to me? Can you
tell me every single word that's
in this bill that you're, why
don't you read this to me?
Read this to me right now and
tell me what it is it repealing.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Go ahead.
We are resentative Lord just
said.
All of this, all of this in
here.
Is and go back to.
Federal
Re legal sale of firearms.
And all I ask of everyone on
this committee.
I
Honestly
We
What you've heard today and what
you vote.
Whether to overturn it.
Or not over
Just
I would just like to know that
everyone here.
Loaded
They're
So ma'am representative was
hoping that you would read the
bill in entirety. So we'll go
through the bill of what you are
repealing.
So on the 7th day waiting
period.
Currently what it states.
Section 30-7-3.
Unlawful sale of firearm before
required waiting periods ends.
A waiting period of 7 calendar
days.
Shall be required for the sale
of farm and the transfer of the
firearm to the buyer.
The 7 day calendar day waiting
period shall include the period
required to conduct a federal
instant background check.
So Madam Chair Representative,
we went through that, which I
talked about, which is in this
bill on how the federal
background check is conducted.
Provided that if the seven day
calendar waiting period has
expired without the completion
required federal background
check. The sheer shall not
transfer the firearm. So Madam
chair and representative, so the
seller may not transfer, so you
as an FFL, where do you put that
firearm? Where does it get
stored because this is part of
this bill.
As, as it was spoke of by my
expert witness.
In his commentary on the first,
we.
All the dealers have to
storeposible for the.
Safety of that firearm for 7
extra days.
So it does put a strain on most
stores capacity.
farms that we have for sale and
the farms that we have sold
also.
All have to be stored.
So Madam Chair represent so
continuing on with this bill.
So
This now puts a 7 day burden of
waiting, waiting on the instant
background check.
And then after 20 days, Madam
Chair representative, that is
now an open status, is that what
I'm understanding that in this
bill, this is now that open
status where it comes back and
it's neither.
Proceeded or denied.
OK, so that's now an open
status. So really, we don't know
what's going on in that bill,
that firearm could be purchased
at that time, is that correct?
OK.
And that's starting from 20 days
from the day.
That they applied.
Is that correct?
Madam Chair representative,
again, this gets into the gray
area that we could got no
response from the.
Like
Or like
Police or anyone on the exact
how this works.
But, yes.
Actually,
On the on the next background
check after waiting period.
If we have not received.
respond to that far.
So
It's
At ours we use 20 days.
Legally transfer the fire.
But there's
Directive
of how penalize you because
there's no structure. Madam
Chairman Representative.
So a page on the farm shall
remain in the custody.
Of the cellar.
Or the federal firearms license
performing representative we're
going through what we're
repealing.
This is not the bill. This is
the law that we have now, the
bill that is
this is what we're repealing
this. It doesn't matter. It just
says repealing the 7th day. We
don't need to discuss what the
law is now you're saying that we
can't ask questions because you
guys don't like this bill.
You're gonna move to table it,
so we therefore can't ask any
questions on this because this
just says we can only ask one
question we can't ask about the
original bills. That's all the
bill is, it's just saying we are
repealing.
The seven-day waiting period
from this bill.
No, that's not a bill. That's
from this law. It is being
repealed.
section 30-7-73 NMSA 1978, we're
repealing the law.
He acted
By the legislator of the state
of New Mexico that we're
repealing this law.
This is a law that we're talking
about of why it should be
repealed. Otherwise we're doing
no, otherwise we should just
move the table every single bill
that comes through if we don't
like it, move the table, move to
table, move to table so good
so I wanna know why I can't ask
about the law that this is
actually about why you why you
censoring me and why you're
saying I can't. You keep
referring to this as the bill.
This is the. This is the law,
correct.
So in this law that we passed.
So the firearm remains in
custody.
Of either the seller, what would
be the FFL? Is that correct? And
where do they store that when
it's being stored.
Madam Chair represented.
Uh, the way it actually works if
you bring a gun into to
transfer.
We have
We as the FFL take
responsibility for that gun at
that moment.
The FFL bears the burden.
Of storage
And responsibility for the
safety of that firearm for the 7
days whether we sold the gun or
transferring it.
OK. Thank you, Madam Chair. So
regarding this law that went
into effect.
Unlawful sales of firearm.
Before the required waiting
period and consists of the
transfer of ownership,
possession, or physical control
of the firearm from the seller
to the buyer before the end of
the required 7-day calendar.
But does not include a temporary
possession or controlling of a
firearm provided to a customer
by the proprietor of the
licensed business and the
conduct of that business. Would
you like to?
Explain more on that, Madam
Chair Ribson.
Uh
Madam chair, verse one of those.
Feels that I am not.
The way I read it, I, uh, any.
Enlightenment on that my hand
him the.
Can you repeat the question,
please? Yes, it's on if you, do
you have a copy of this?
Of the actual bill of the actual
law. It's on the 2nd page.
Maybe C.
Unlawful sell the firearm before
the required waiting period
consists of a transfer.
And what was your exact
question? My question is, how is
it unlawful?
And how does it affect the
person who's selling. What, what
happens to them?
If it's unlawful sale, they
can't purchase the gun.
No, I mean, if it's unlawful
sound, miss.
Many representative
What this bill is saying
unlawful self a firearm before
the required waiting period. So
now this is what the 7 day.
Weight law has become.
It has become that there is now.
Something that happens to the
FFL. Is that correct, Jason?
The new law.
You're penalized in some way or
another. Is that correct?
Madam Chair, Representative, I
don't, can't say that they're
penalized, but they're
They put this, they have a
burden that's put on them to
store the gun.
Even though it belongs to
somebody else.
And if something happens to that
gun, they're responsible for it.
It puts an additional burden on
them because of the cost to
store it.
And the paperwork and the man
hours to maintain it.
I'm Chair Representative, what's
the criminal penalty for it.
If you sell a firearm to
somebody before you wait for the
7 day waiting period.
On this bill, madam Chair,
representative.
It is a misdemeanor offense.
Thank you. That's what I was
getting.
The amount to representative on
this law.
Each party to an unlawful sale
of fire before the required
waiting period ends.
is in violation of this section
and may be charged separately
for the same sale. So can you
explain what that means, Chair,
representative experts.
Section D
Madam Chair Representative, I
assume it's speaking that both.
The FFL and the purchaser both
so in other words,
when this bill was passed, I saw
when this bill was passed in the
law.
It states it's a misdemeanor in
each party to unfollow unlawful
sale of the firearm before the
required waiting period ends as
a violation of the section may
be separately charged for the
same sale, and that's my
interpretation on that too.
Madam Chair and Representative,
each farm sold contrary to the
the provisions of the section
constitutes a separate offense
under subsection C of this
section.
Some Madam Chair
representatives, is it stating
that each farm sold contrary to
the provisions. So if they sold
multiple firearms, and I'm sure
that a misdemeanor for each
charge.
Madam Chair
Man represented 2 or more
offenses may be charged in the
same complaint information
indictment, and shall be
punished as separate offenses,
so that clarifies what we just
said, correct, Madam Chair
representative that you're
looking at multiple events, and
that's even
If the
Nick system comes back as
proceed, correct? Even if it
comes back to proceed if you
sell before the 7th day, you're
looking at a misdemeanor and so
is the person purchasing.
Correct?
Adam chair represented correct.
All of these are based on the
waiting the 7 days.
Manage and representative, these
are all based on lawful gun
owners trying to purchase a
firearm, not people who didn't
pass the NIC system, is that
correct? If they're denied, they
never get the farm. Is that
correct?
Right, Madam chair represented
correct.
There's an in denied response.
I represent whoever violates the
provision of this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor. So
there we have it right there, so
it could be charged multiple
times for this law that went
into effect, it was a bill.
And
It could be charged for multiple
times if there's multiple done.
Now Me represent that leads to
the question I was asking
earlier, and representative.
Since we don't have a time frame
in the law.
And we don't have a time frame
from DPS.
Would you then be in violation
because you don't know when 7
day ends it began if you were
kind of guessing, saying, OK, if
they filed it at this time on
this date and count 7 days, but
that techling wasn't correct,
you could still be charged with
a misdemeanor. Is that correct?
Madam Chair, representative.
Correct
I
It has never been tested in the
court that I know of.
Only
Enforcement is
is from would be from.
Someone complaining about a
sale.
Oh, as far as I know, no law
enforcement has ever even tried
to enforce this bill.
Thank you, Madam Chairman
Representative. I honestly don't
know how they would enforce this
bill anyways unless it was
somehow used in a criminal
activity because of legal
persons purchasing the firearm,
you would have no idea because
we don't have gun registries.
The madam chairs represent the
provisions of the section do not
apply to the cell of firearm.
To buyer who holds a valid FFL.
So because you have a valid FFL
representative, you can still
buy the firearm without a 7 day
wait. Is that correct?
Madam Chair, representative
correct.
I could buy a firearm or.
For my business.
I as an FFL want to take a gun
home.
I have to follow the same rules.
So Madam Cha representative, uh,
you can also sell to a buyer who
holds a valid New Mexico
concealed license. So if they
have a concealed carry, then
that bypasses the 7 day.
Wait.
So Madam Chair Representative,
can you briefly explain uh very
quickly what the difference is
like, are you?
Are there extra more background
checks when you get a concealed
carry, or is it pretty much the
same as what the Knicks?
It's a Madam Chair
Representative.
It, uh
You are fingerprinted. It is a
little.
You are on a registry if you
have.
A concealed carry permit I've
got a concealed carry permit and
there wasn't anything extra as a
matter of fact, there weren't as
many of those questions.
So I guess what I'm trying to
say, I don't see that a
concealed carry supersedes.
The NIC system. The NIC system
acts quite a few questions.
Uh, representative.
Madam Chair represented correct.
As I stated
The main difference is.
They keep a registry.
Of
Good seal carry.
The next check actually.
that you do on a firearm.
Does not put you in that.
mixed system
is purged
Constantly
Me of someone trying to get at
it because DPS is looking at
them. They have instant access
to you if you should not be
carrying a firearm.
But there is nothing I have seen
when I go in to get my concealed
carry that is above and beyond
with the NIC system is. The
reason I'm asking this is
because this is one of the
loopholes that if you want a
supersede the whole thing, you
could go ahead and get a
concealed carry, which you've
actually had more questions
asked when you bought the
firearm in the first place, is
what I was trying to get at Mad
I'm sure.
There
Background.
The same.
Right
So basically Meurs and the
reason I'm asking about this and
harping on this is because
you've already had.
This background check when you
bought the firearm, the far more
extensive than even it could
still carry.
So Madam Chair, so the other
exceptions are.
To a law enforcement agency,
correct? And that's 2 agencies,
not.
Not any law enforcement. Law
enforcement is not exception.
Law enforcement must go get,
they have to wait the 7 day or
they have to go above and beyond
the Leosa that they have and
they have to go get a concealed
carry. Is that correct?
Which, by the way, I've had a
lot of law enforcement that are
furious about that because they
don't understand why they have
all this training in the
academy, they have all the
training they go every year to
the range to go renew their
Leosa. They don't understand why
they're not exempt from.
Madam Chair and representative.
Between 2 and law form between
two law enforcement officers
authorized to carry a firearm
and certified pursuit to federal
law.
So 2, the two people that are
exempt on top of that are the
two law enforcement officers.
That can sell.
A firearm
To each other
And Sam has to go through a
background check, but they could
sell a firearm to each other.
But they cannot walk in and just
buy a firearm for you, from you
as FFL, they still have to wait
that 7 days, correct?
Madam, the way I interpret the
law, that is correct.
They're trying.
Law enforcement officers is the
same between as not required to
do that.
Right, which I, I thought was
the one that blew me away and
this one and Madam Chair
represented between immediate
family members because.
If you're selling between two
family members, that seems
A very interesting thing to do
when a law enforcement officer
can't go in and just buy an FFL
without having to wait. I that
that was the one that got me
because there's some people in
my family would not sell a
firearm to.
So
That was interesting. So Madam
Chair and Representative.
Uh, we go through with a firearm
means, we go through immediate
family, and that means a spouse,
so they could sell to a spouse,
a parent, a child, a sibling, a
grandparent, grandchild, great
grandchild, niece, nephew, a
first cousin, and an aunt or
uncle.
So when they come in.
And I'm almost done
um.
I, um, it's after 8 o'clock.
Um, we've been going on and um.
I think we can without more
audience participation and plus
um having fresh eyes on this
another time, um, I'm suggesting
that we roll this over and we
end for the evening.
And um it's gone way long, uh.
Also, because of, you know, the.
Caucus going really long. We
didn't get to start early and
then we have.
A lot of questions that um we
can come back to.
Adam chair.
I personally,
Do not want to roll this bill.
We waited for changes in the
In your order
We'd have been up here 2 hours
ago and I realized you have the
deal, but we
took questions for a long time
and delayed, delayed,
you know,
I, I just want to say we didn't
delay.
Anything. The legislative we had
Hispanic day in the roundhouse,
which went long.
Then we had a caucus and
Republicans always wait for
Democratic caucuses, which,
which is also
Something the house always does,
and also the equality of members
in this chamber is guaranteed by
our rules. So, Madam Chair, if
the gentlemen would like to
finish his bill. I, I have no
problem with it, but I don't
think that it's in the best
interest of this committee to
cut off debate, force him to
roll the bill, and then God only
knows when we'll hear it the
next time.
And I do have questions, Madam
Chair.
Um,
if I may.
The main reason I don't do I
have 22 witnesses here.
If I roll the bill I have to
they have to make another.
One lives in Austin. OK, we
will.
In consideration of your
experts, and I will give us
another 10 minutes till 8:15.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Grand Chap representative, I
think I've made all the
statements and oh also object to
just being.
Um, also Medisure
representative, I've, I've said
everything they need to say on
this, um.
I support your bill because for
numerous reasons,
There's too many complications.
The fact that it's incredibly
struggling for people who have
the FFLs to hold the firearms to
people and Harlan Vinson also
represented Harlem Vinson also
made a statement. He purchased a
firearm, didn't get there in
time, had to redo the whole
process. He's done it 3 times,
still has not been able to
purchase his firearm because
when you live in a rural
community and you're looking for
a specific firearm.
It may be a challenge to try to
get there, so for all of those
following reasons, I uh.
finish asking questions. Thank
you, chair.
Thank you, Representative Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative.
I appreciate the
The generated from
those counties for helping me
answer some of the questions
that I had. I did have some
questions, Madam Chair
Representative, first, I, did,
did you see any data showing
that
current law
is effective in preventing gun
violence in the state, Madam
Chair, representative.
Um
I did not all that I saw.
Was either or.
Or some
Uh, I believe, though, did have
some data on that that she.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair.
And I, and I asked that because
I see a bunch of different data
that's been put in some of these
analyses and I, I see it, it
leans very skewed, right, Madam
Chair. So I, I looked at this.
My own, and I found some studies
that have been peer reviewed
from very reputable sources, the
National Research Council, they
find, Madam Chair, that
Waiting periods do not have a
significant effect on overall
suicide rates as individuals
often substitute by other means,
unfortunately, Madame Cherry
found another wine Bureau of
Justice statistics. This one
shows.
That the folks who have already
obtained or obtained illegal
sources, it renders firearm
waiting periods for new
purchases pretty much.
Mute. It's, it's doesn't matter.
It's a moot point, Madam Chair,
there's another one, Brady Gun
Violence Prevention Act. There's
a study on that, homicides and
suicide rates from Ludwig and
Cook. This one shows, Madam
Chair, found no significant
association with reductions in
homicide rates. Another one,
Madam Chair Representative RAND
Corporation highlighted
different difficulties in
enforcing waiting period laws,
especially in states with
significant private party
firearm transactions that are
not subject to the same
regulations. So Madam Chair,
representative, I guess, could
you just address
that. And then the concerns that
I've seen in the analysis of
your bill, which is your bill.
And so, Madam Chair, I think
that that one.
was from the sentencing
commission, I think they had a
Gifford study. That's what's
something called peas and
A Aca.org. I don't, I don't know
if I'm pronouncing that right,
but could you guys just address
that maybe, maybe the gentleman
uh.
Something to add, Madam Chair.
Uh, I'm sorry.
Could you just address the
studies that are in the analysis
versus the actual studies that
are peer reviewed, Madam Chair.
Madam Chair, representative, as
I stated, I.
Personally did not.
But it's been stated by.
Representative Lord and
What am I
One of uh in
Approval of our bill on the
thing that there is studies that
show.
Some studies even show an
adverse.
Thank you, Madam Chair. No,
thank you, Madam Chair, and I
think that's helpful in this
conversation. I think before,
before we address this issue and
before we vote on it, that we
know, OK.
Where's the data, right? I know
in this chamber, we always talk
about let's make data-driven
decisions. Let's make sure that
it is always based in data,
Madam Chair, the data I see
here.
It actually contradicts.
Having this law on the books,
which is why I think Ma
representative is why you
brought it forward, because this
issue is something that has been
just added as a stumbling block
for folks, at least for me,
because I live in rural New
Mexico. We just had two gun
shops closed down after this law
went into effect.
And so now I have to drive all
the way to Cruises to go to
Sportsman's, and then drive all
the way back an hour and a half
back home.
And then drive all the way back
2 more times. So, Madam Chair
representative, I think that's
something that is is a really
salient point. And so, Madam
Chair Representative, do we have
any information or data on on
states that are more rural
states that have less
populations and how these have
affected those states.
Madam Chair.
Madam Chair representative, I
personally do not.
Uh
One of our witnesses want to
speak to that, you know, it, I
do know there's plenty of states
in the United States out of all
the.
That have any uh
You know, most of the
the surroundings stated earlier,
Madam Chair representative.
Do not have a waiting
So our
You're a Mexico resident, you
can go to any state that has a

There is a federal law that
prohibits me from buying a.
And got in another state.
But any state that does not.
Have
The waiting period I can drive.
Why
Take it with me when I leave.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair
Representative. OK, so that
makes sense. So, for me, I live
close close to.
Cruises, but I live close El
Paso as well, and I could just
go the other way. And it's
probably about an hour and a
half. So if I wanted a new AR or
something, I could just go to El
Paso, and then the business that
Madam Chair, I would have.
For New Mexico.
FFL
would actually go probably to
Texas FFL. So I think that's
probably the concern. OK. Thank
you, Madam Chair, and I, I think
that's helpful. I think that's
something that folks need to
consider because
It's not just about the actual
policy, but it's also the fiscal
impacts on those local
businesses, because I know at
least in my community, we've,
we've had that directly impact
us cause they said, you know
what, I've been in the firearm
business for for years and
years, decades, and this is just
the last straw, right?
And so I think Madam Chair
Representative, from what I've
heard from all your, your
experts and from you, it sounds
to me like
Like this would actually be
beneficial to folks who are
Of low income, low means, folks
who live in rural New Mexico,
could you just address that for
me?
What your bill would do to help
those folks.
A representative as I stated
earlier in this and stated
numerous times tonight.
This uh
That put an undue burden on our
small business.
To sail, firearms.

stated, we lose.

And on
Thank you so much, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative. And
uh, you know what, I, I just saw
something in my analysis that
kind of caught my eye.
And it was Department of Public
Safety.
As well as the AG's office.
They say that there's
No major operational changes
that would be needed to be done
since
If this law was going to be
enacted, which
For me,
I, I don't want to say
correlation is causation, but it
does make me wonder.
Just how much this law is
actually being used.
There's no real impact to their
office or to the AG's office,
which would, they would be the
ones who would have to enforce
this. So Madam Chair
Representative, I guess, I don't
know if you have any comment on
that, but it sounds to me like
that's probably it.
Madam,
uh, I hit on it just a little
bit.
And as my expert witness say
said earlier we reached out.
The law enforcement for
direction in this law 7th day
when it starts when it stops.
And without any direction, I've.
There has been no court cases
that I have seen.
Where anybody has brought forth.
A charge on any FFL for misuse
of this law.
Most
The law enforcement in our area.
Will not
Do not do
There's no, no record keeping no
checking.
The only way that it would be
tested is if.
Someone complained
Our law enforcement as their.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair,
and thank you, Representative,
and that I think that's a good
point to be made and I think
that's something that we should
all consider on this
legislation. It's, it's
Currently ineffective from the
way I see it in my opinion.
Right. The way, the way it's
currently written.
There is nothing that's actually
going to help.
Public safety because, madam
chair, as we've probably already
discussed,
Folks who are
Doing these
Heinous crimes in our state.
With guns
Most of those folks get those
guns illegally.
On the illegal market.
So, Madam Chair Representative,
I mean, if you force someone to
wait for 7 days, and they're
probably already not even
getting pass a background check
in the, in the first place.
When they don't need to do that,
they can just get it off the
street, and then that continues
to to fight.
Or continues to contribute to
our fight against.
Right. So, Madam Chair
Representative, I think that
that is something that needs to
also be addressed, because this
law.
That's currently written is not
being used.
So repealing it would pretty
much not do anything but restore
the rights of constitutional
Americans who are already
currently.
Utilizing their 2nd Amendment
right, their constitutional
rights in the state
constitution, and so this
legislation would just pretty
much
Allow those individuals not to
have those charges, if that did
indeed happen, even though it
can't happen because the next
system wouldn't allow it, right?
So Madam Chair representative,
could you just address that for
me too?
I can understand.
Madam.
Uh
I agree, it is, is out of stated
numerous times.
Criminals could care less what
laws we have on the books.
From the legal FFLs in the
state.
So all these laws do is affect
the legal.
Legal gun owners and and legal
business.
It, uh
It only hurts our law abiding
businesses
and if you could answer the
question directly and on the.
Represented
I don't know if that is, madam
Chair. I don't know if that
addressed this question or not.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair
Representative. No, it did. I
think that this is good, and I
think that when we're talking
about fighting crime and trying
to create a crime package. I
think this is just one of the
spokes on that wheel, Madam
Chair, because we want to make
sure folks who are following the
law, they don't have undue
burden on them when it comes to
accessing the rights.
And so I know that this is
currently in litigation, I
believe, Madam Chair
Representative. I think there
was a case maybe a year ago,
something like that. Do we know
if there
The status of that could in any
way impact this legislation.
Madam Chair.
Representative, litigation
regarding the seven-day waiting
period.
Madam Chair Representative, I'm
not aware of any litigation
it's not on the bill. And madam,
actually I do in in our
analysis, it does say more on
point.
A federal court, this is the,
the um.
Committee analysis, the 2nd
page, um, second full paragraph,
more on point, a federal court
has already preliminately
preliminarily upheld the
constitutionality of New

answering the question that the

Madam that's a witness's fault.
Oh, it was a point of interest
that was being brought up.
And a point of order.
And
Um, that is accepted if I
recognize the um I'm sure she
didn't say point of order, so it
wasn't a point of order,
so we started talking on that
point
we can end now. I need I have
more questions, Madam Chair.
This bill is very intriate. OK,
we're just gonna go into recess
