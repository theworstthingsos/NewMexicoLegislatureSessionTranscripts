side. I just want you to know I
thank Howie for his service to
the state and the
administration. And again, we're
here for 2 more years.
And if you'll also join with me.
As you always do.
We can and will continue to
improve the quality of life for
everyone in the state.
And as I close today, do not
clap for that. As I close today,
I got to watch these guys.
OK. As I close today, I do want
to return.
To the pressing issue of making
New Mexico safe for every
citizen.
I do. I recognize the issues
that plague us are rooted in
poverty and inequality and
generational challenges, long
neglected.
This speech and in fact my
entire tenure has been committed
my entire career to fighting
these scourges.
And we have come so far
together.
But our crime problem
destabilizes the very
communities we seek to empower.
It threatens the very prosperity
of our state in which we have
invested so much.
As you know, it is a small.
But significant group of repeat
offenders and criminals who
wreak a large percentage of the
havoc.
On our people and our
businesses, we cannot, we must
not let this continue.
We need the tools to overcome
this challenge.
And I know
That we can do so while
respecting civil rights.
And to protect the right of
every family to live safely, the
right of small businesses to
conduct commerce securely.
And the rights of our children
to go up in communities free
from danger.
So let's double down on our
achievements and let's expand
their reach.
Let's protect our achievements
and let's ensure their
effectiveness. Let's extend the
promise of New Mexico to every
corner of our state.
And let's guarantee that
collective.
An enduring legacy for which we
have all fought so.
Hard
Thank you.
God bless you and God bless the
great state of New Mexico.
Thank you
to
Ladies and gentlemen, another
