Call the legislative finance
committee back to order
please and we
do have a our first
presentation
if we could get to have a lot to the
table
please.
Senator were you gonna make any
opening any opening
comments come on
up.
What is this business of
pains for
LFC
staff.
Madam chair I got
a little too excited playing soccer
last week so I rolled my
ankle. Hopefully
it goes away soon.
Madam chair members the committee thank
you my name's sunny lu I'm your
public schools analyst
and today we
have 3 doctors for you today
with Dr Stephen
Farrell who's a public
finance economist
who is also a expert
witness in the Martinez Yazzie
case we have Dr
Karen Sanchez Griego
who is the superintendent of the
Cuba Independent School District
and we have Dr Kurt
Steinhaus who is our
newly designated secretary for
the public education
department
you're.
I'm Ted H.
today you can
find a brief
from our staff here
and just briefly
some high level
findings the
court.
Essentially said that the
state was not providing
sufficient resources and
programs to
address the needs of at risk
students.
They didn't give any specific
remedies but they highlighted a
lot of deficiencies
particularly around the
state's ability to provide pre
K. K. 3 plus
reading interventions and the
like you can see on
page one there's
a huge increase almost
more than tripling of the at
risk funding that the
state as provided in the last
few years and on
page 2 you can
see the
participation as we talked
earlier this week about K.
5 plus extended
learning how much the state
is made available versus what has
been taken
up by the districts and
charters and
without further ado I'd like to turn
it over to doctor borrow this
with us online and
soon to talk a
little bit more about at
risk funding and some
of those
recommendations.
Good morning everyone
okay can you hear
more saving what we
can do both thank you
Sir excellent
thank you good to meet
you all I'm sorry not to figure
out that
did a full
house.
Well I am
This state various
issues concerning
Act research funding
and
resources.
Came involved with this
topic.
At 24
rate immediately
after the Yazzie case
was filed I
volunteered to
help fine
thanks with
that technical
issues an
analysis I
became an expert
witness at
the trial and
2017.
And that I
that I follow
developments
at at
Representative
regarding that school
finance and
especially
the treatment of that
rich it in
New Mexico.
So when when
you read the final
court order.
The Yazzie Martinez
K..
Use date date
date the order
focuses
almost exclusively
on the need to
improve and
augment Education
specifically for at
risk
students.
The court defining
this at risk group
to include students
from economically
disadvantaged
hello.
English learners
and native
Americans
the card also
included at
students with disabilities
from this group
but I want the president today
because that handled
under a completely
separate legal and
financial
resident.
At the rate the reason for
focusing on student
at risk is very
clear.
That being
poor well with
limited,nd of
English tends to
impede learning.
So if factors
students
receive.
All only the save
resources and
service. As
more granted
students
that'll earn less on
average thank you
share will fall
further behind
and even worse
when at risk students
receive inferior
resources.
The learning gap
between average
and not at risk 3 times
larger.
This happens too often
even in normal
times.
But reserves and
their quality increase
dramatically during the
past pandemic
here mainly
because of our limited
access that
risk students
online
instruction.
So what can be
done.
The practice under
lactation extra
fund of the lot but
the disadvantage all over
the United States.
Colluding through the
federal title
one program.
Is that
directing
extra resources
at risk students
can reduce the learning
gap even
though perhaps not
eliminated
entirely.
And the same
premise.
Underlies the extra
weight.
That New Mexico's
exceeds the legislative
equalization guarantee
formula
allows for accurate
students.
In 2014
what the lawsuits were
filed.
That extra weight was
almost
insignificant.
But that in
response to the court
ruling the
legislature has raised
the weight starkly
more than tripling
get. So
this year the
extra at
risk right.
Generates about
$300000000.
Which would be enough
in fairy.
That this report got
21 percent
add on to
base funding
for every student
cap it at risk for block
the other partners.
But there's a problem.
Although this
300000000
is often referred
to as at
risk Monday.
The label is
misleading.
These funds
have not in
fact been
reserved for extra
services or
indeed for any
services for at
risk students.
Many New Mexico
state and district
officials still
hope to a long
a long running
tradition
that all SCG
funding including at
risk funding
is general
purpose revenue
to be allocated by
districts and
charter schools
as they see fit.
Which means believing it that
read district or
school to decide
how much money if
any to spend that
extra services for at
risk students.
Now one might have
expected to iterations
developments to
have broken that
tradition.
First of course is that the
card which
called unambiguously
for the state to
augment
services
specifically for those
at risk.
The staff and the
2019 the
legislature
mandated that
funds.
Generated by the
SDG Act risk
factor must
be spent on.
Specified
and identified
services.
That's the statutory
language specified and
I think that might.
Act which is.
Further that
every district and
school must report
annually on how
it uses at risk
funds.
Benefit at risk
students.
But even this
combination
of court orders and
Legislative
stipulations
has not been
enough.
At thus far
alter officials
they hated how
do I know this
at the beginning of
the 2019
to 20 school
year.
Some physically
spread district
open an act
that they would spend their
actors dollars
for general purposes
Sanchez across
the board salary
increase.
And state officials
including some
MedPage today
at and I
have to say even
that LFC
not only the
but even in regards
this behavior
so as a
result.
Top of the most of the so
called activation
money did not
translate into
extra spending
specifically for
the activists students
and then of course we know
how things turn
even for the negative
in the following school
year
2021.
I believe therefore that we
need
first a more
explicit and
for school statutory
provision something
along these
lines.
I.
Generated by the
SCG populist
Act risk factor
shall be spent
only for specific
supplemental services
for identified at
risk students
not for anything
else.
Yeah it
directive were
implemented.
We would expect to see
in each district.
More spending
for at risk
students that
person not at
risk that
is.
Senator will help
take up the
restart the resource
distribution.
In favor of the at
risk groups.
But realistically
8 even
of for personal
statutory mandate
the the kind I've.
Suggested
would not be selfish
46.
Because money is
fungible.
Districts and
schools usually
have opportunity
to to use
nominally earmarked
at dollars
to supplant their
regular funds.
So to ensure
that at risk fund
really got at
it. Meaning
they by experience
services for
actress students
over and above
service this program
provided by regular school
program.
Mandate has to
be backed up by an
effective accountability
system.
That that brings
me back to Yazzie
Martinez.
Because in her
final order
judge singled Gen
enjoying the state
to create an accountability
system to
ensure that at risk
money was being
used to meet the
needs of at risk
students.
Today it's
2.5 years
later and
knows such
system.
Exist.
The 29 in the
legislature
as I mentioned.
It reduces the reporting
requirement.
That P.
he could
have used.
That that.
Right that P.
P. 88 could
have turned into
our of the system
of accountability
for proper use of at
risk funding.
But in fact PED's
response was minimal
that.
Schools were at
only 3.. point
How to divide it they're
at risk money
Senator rods
and bait use
categories that
approach that reveals
nothing about
what specific
services were
provided to
assume.
Without going into
detail.
A serious accountability
system would
collect
data.
Such things that
the specific types
of at risk
students
at that school is
serving the number
Sir the kinds
of services provided
the amount of service for
a student the
types of service providers
and what they were Hey.
Other crossing
her.
Total cost per
student and
I think most of
pourtant the need
that extra
cost.
8 supposedly
the supplemental
service and I let
some of these items
I've page 3 of my
paper written I think
your hat.
Now further
monetary would have to
accompany reporting
it would be pointless to
neglect reports
for more than 800
schools unless
there were PED staff
available to
review them
to interact with
districts and schools
over any questions that
arose at
the overstate corrective
action which might
even include
conducting field visits
and audits when
necessary.
I'm pretty sure that PED
does not have the resources
to carry out these
functions.
And I don't know that P.
E. state
would welcome the
assignment even
if additional funding were
forthcoming.
But all ultimately it
is up to the legislature
to decide how
much has to be done
to ensure that at risk
students not properly
Sir.
Now regarding the
$300000000
its so called Act
money.
How much extra
funding could that
provide
activation
students.
The answer obviously
depends on how
many students are counted
as at
risk.
New Mexico right
now has
to
rival
conflicting definitions
of at risk.
Both of which for the
different regions
yield exaggerated
pass.
One is this fact
all right definition
used in the SCG
funding formula
the other is
that.
All.
We have a technical
issue
here.
The.
I can.
Just
allow.
Senator.
Here there we we
can hear him but it's
not we're not
we're not getting the
broadcast.
We want to see if we can come
back to sunny
why don't we do that and we'll bring
Dr borrowed back
in
we do have is paper in front
of us so
what we'll do is we'll go to the next
presenter and then we'll bring
will bring up.
Of curious he's looks
like he's on the phone
okay.
Sonny he's answering your phone
call.
Just the start proper.
Amy now we can hear
you now go ahead
Sir.
Anyway try
again.
I'm not exactly
sure. Where
we thought.
I was thinking about that
the different definition
yes you you
talked about the
definition the
first definition you're
talking it next
about the second definition
if you if you could pick up from
that. From
the actual
definition.
In the SCG
formula and
then we have the different
definition adopted
by the court
and if you look at the table
I pay for a plan
the paper.
You can see that
definition
includes 3
activists categories
but only one
category
English learners
it is common to
both.
The most important
difference
concerned economically
disadvantaged
students.
The
definition
which is based on census
estimates of students
from families below the
poverty line
is widely
recognized as
being too
narrow
because many students who are
above the poverty
line but with low
incomes
still face important
impediment
to learning.
The court definition
which is based
mainly on
eligibility
for free
school a lot
it's too
broad.
Under the current federal
rules
specifically the
community eligibility
provision.
A school can
claim.
100 percent
of students as eligible
for a lot of if
only 40 percent
are from families
enrolled in certain
federal welfare
program.
So as a result.
The free lunch
definition
substantially
overstates the
number of low
income state.
Now fortunately
pool
new and
better measures
of low income have
become available in New
Mexico.
One is the count I
just mentioned of
students from
5 families
participating in federal
welfare programs
the other is the new family
and act family hi
the family income
index
which is based mainly
at data from state
income tax
returns and
which the state is
now trying
out.
Under a small
appropriation
under at B.
17 of
2021.
Either of these would
produce a more valid
measure
of low income
students
probably 40 or
probably 40 to 50
percent statewide.
That either the
census count
for the free line
measure.
Right.
No there's only one
had reached category
that appears in the F. as
the date that the
nation but not in
the courts and that the
category called
file students.
I can't get into the
details now but
I believe this factors
conceptually and technically
flawed.
And perhaps more
importantly.
It has been treated as
a group they're relevant
and almost all discussions
before the court
of the needs of at
risk students
you find that hardly ever
mention any
submissions the card
by he there the
Yazzie Martinez
plaintiffs or the
defendant.
So.
But if there's some political
reasons for retaining
mobility factor
that are better ways of doing
it at all kind to
animals.
The average category
that appears in the courts
definition
but not in the SCG
definition is
native
American.
There have been all of those
to add them to the actress
found.
Notably in the
recent tribal
remedy
framework.
These proposals right
questions about how
the resulting extra
funds might be used
and what what rules
tribal institutions
might play in
managing that
and I I confess to
not having a good grasp
of this topic but
I'll say a bit more
in my remarks of formula
improvements.
One thing is certain
though is that a
native American
category with
overlap greatly with
the other at risk
categories
because many native
American students
are either low income
English learners
or follow.
Now.
This mention of
overlap.
Bring it back to the
point that both
of the president actress
definitions are
exactly.
The 69
percent
statewide officials
tell local that comes
from the SCG
formula
reflex
expensive
double and triple
counting for
example
a poor student
who is also an English
learner and Google
I'll would be capped
at 3 pack.
We cannot extract
any other duplicate
have from the projects
set of data
because the census
property numbers
are available only
for the district not
for schools or individual
student.
But because the new
measures I mentioned
the new income measures
are based on
data I'm individual
students they
could be used to
produce on the
webpage it happens
and I would expect the
statewide
rate have to
be far below 69
percent.
Probably in the
4050 percent
range.
Now the court's definition
yields overclocked
total. For
a different reason
namely that its main
proponent
is the 73
percent of New Mexico
students who
qualify for
free lunch.
When you add to that
73 percent.
16 percent
it was English
learners and
10 percent native
Americans you
get up to almost
100
percent.
But what one hears
more often.
Is that about 80
percent of New
Mexico students are
at risk.
So whoever
divide is 80 percent
figure much
somehow have taken
account of
duplication
but never the less
because the free one
to cast itself is much
too large 80
percent
probably is still
20 or more percentage
points to.
So I offer you
point 5 for is that
regarding these
insulated
activist public
schools.
Saying that
nearly everyone
is at risk is
essentially equivalent
to saying no one is
that right.
An act respecting
nation that covers
nearly all students
is useless for targeting
resources it
leads to spreading the
limited at risk
I.
Widely and shallow
and shallowly.
Instead of directing
that the places most
in the.
Now the flawed I mention of
the STTC date at
risk factors are
well known at
a particular
vote tally at
the at LFC
analysts have
repeatedly
explain shortcomings
of the poverty
and free lunch
factors.
But.
With
that.
With that great
effect. But
I think several
0 factors
may have improved
the prospects for formula
right.
First we
have the staff very
definition clashing
with the courts definition.
Second we have better
measures of lowincome
now. And
there the amount
of at risk bodies has
greatly increased
so how
that money is distributed
it has become
more consequential
so maybe the time
has come for the
Legislature to consider
changes that
correct some all
flaws
and had better
reflect the current
condition.
That formula development
or improvement
and that in the
packed Strack.
At thank you
work is needed to
understand had different
revisions would
affect allocations
the districts and schools
so I don't presume here
to to offering you
formula but I
do have some exact
suggestions
about particular
changes that you might want
to consider.
Number one.
Disaggregation.
I don't know why someone
long ago thought
it was a good idea
to add together counts
of 3 different kinds of
at risk students
and then throw Alliance
single way the
resulting follicle
but that approach seems
misguided.
Including a category
separately each at risk
category separately
in the formula
each with its own appropriate
white with
better maxed funding
needs and also
make the farm those
calculations and
more transparent.
Hello second
replacement of the sent
property cap I've
already explained
why it should be
replaced
and I find it
did you.
Family income
index as
the most promising
candidate right now
to be a
replacement.
Number 3
elimination of double
and triple counting.
Using one of the newer
income measures that
mention one
could calculate
duplicated count
of that pre
students.
Now that does
not mean that the
extra learning
difficulties this
result thank you for having
what more than one
officials convictions
should be ignored
for example a
student who is both
who were an English
learner might be
assigned to formula
weight state
25 percent
greater but
not double
that every student is only
for.
For.
Differentiation
by level of income
or property
concentration.
The family income
index will
allow greater way
to be assigned to
students in the
lowest income bracket
bracket that
does in the next
lowest or
alternatively
a concentration
would be added
to direct extra
funding for poor
students to
districts with the highest
percentages of
poor students
the staff to different
devices for
further to help us
the distribution of that
money toward the
most impoverished
life.
50 eliminate
the replacement of the
mobility factor.
I won't get into details
of by that.
But well
1 allocated to what
we have now
thanks to the use of the
2017
LFC study
and it was to identify
students who had
attended more
than the number of schools
normal for their grade
level.
Another approach
is to forget about
tapping it in
individual models
it is altogether
and it's bad
news indicates that
to use Google.
Enrollment data
and membership
data to
calculate that district
or school
student turnover
rate.
Now I mentioned inclusion
of native
American.
The question is whether to
provide extra
funding specifically
for native Americans
on top of the
allocation
based on the other at
risk
factors.
I'm not prepared to venture
an opinion but I want to
mention some
relatives come
relevant
consideration.
First there are mandate
in the court ruling
and the Indian Education
Act to
provide
culturally and
linguistically responsive
services.
Second we have the
difficulty Arbor
fees of some of
the tribe will carry
which affect things like
that internetting the
prescription.
Third we have a possible
role for tribal
institution
in designing or even
providing services
that last thought
Chavis to imply.
That some form of
direct funding of those
agencies which
might require
adding a special funding
channel to the
existing SCG
mechanism.
Finally allocation
individual
schools.
Some have proposed
allocating Act
money had to
directly.
Directly to individual
school. Which
is what's now being
done with the
family income
index trial.
This could result in more
priest precise
targeting and may be
more equitable treatment
of schools.
But new concerns
about supplanting fighter
offside leading
to a need for
additional accountability
provision.
That there's no doubt
that they are Representative
publications the schools
would make the whole system more
complex by
separating at risk
funding from
the rest of the SCG
funding mechanism.
But on the bright side
this might help to convince
traditionalist
that at risk money
is really something
different and special
and different from regular
and CTE
funding.
It probably goes
without saying.
That the indicator is
used to distribute
that money to the districts
are schools
would not be
relevant
except perhaps for English
learners for
deciding which
particular children
within our school
should receive supplemental
services.
It seems clear that
educational
criteria
not state whether a
particular student
is who are
control the selection
so at the elementary
level the priority
group by the
students seriously
behind in reading
at the high school level
well it might be
students in danger of dropping
out.
To my knowledge that this
topic that within school
allocation of
at risk money
has received
very little attention at
the state level
and providing guidance
on these priorities
is it had Pete
the I want to
undertake
when it constructed
accountability
system you
have to build a system called
for by the
court.
My last thought
I have not offered
any opinion
about the
appropriate total
amount of that risk
funding because
I recognized that
ultimately a political
decision.
Now generally studies
of the connection between
funding and
educational
outcomes for low
income students
6 that at least
25 percent
supplemental
funding per student
if it does need to make
a significant difference
but some estimates are
higher that 50
to 100 percent extra
funding would be
made.
Not current SCG
at risk funding
falls short of
the 25 percent
mark but not
by a large
percentage.
We will not find out
though what
results at
1225 percent
or any other funding
in criminal might
produce
until the added
the principal is
satisfied that
is until
districts and schools
stop treating actors
dollars as
general revenue
and that meant
exclusively
supplemental
services for at
risk students.
So those some might not
thank you thank you doctor
of we're going to have you
hold if you would please
we're gonna go through the rest of the
presentation
and if you
would would like you to stand for
questions who's
next a
sunny.
Madam chair I believe
superintendent.
At Karen Sanchez Griego
has a presentation
introduce.
Madam chair and members of the
committee okay we'll have to pull
that up a little closer please
okay that are
yes R. madam
chair members of the committee thank you for
allowing me to speak to
you today.
I'm here to talk to you about the state's
investment dollars to
students leading to success in
both academic and
social emotional read
arenas as
you know Q.
I just do is a
yes the plaintiff district
in the Yazzie Martinez
case and
also note
that that we
operate in have been operating
with culture language at the forefront
of our of our work we want
to show you a video first
and then I'm going to go in I want to talk
about
right afterwards
exactly what the economist was talking
about dollars to
kids.
Hey and area
laughing mission
3 staying
at the Russian
mission displaying
yeah yeah this is a very
rural and secluded area
but it is of great beauty there
is tons of trees tens
of Arroyo's tons
of just
beautiful scenery out here at the
you know so where we
are we lack in areas
we're very
rich and as far as
beauty and and culture
the Cuba is currently the
number one most at risk will district
in the state of New Mexico and
there's a lot of factors that go into
that many of our
families in the keep the school district
did not have running water
they do not have electricity
our kids are 71
percent native American
Navajo
26 percent
are Hispanic
and then the other percentages
other there has been some
controversy in our community
because of that and we have been
trying to work at all and on
that as we're teaching our kids
we have 5 languages in our
district we're 100 percent free
and reduced lunch I've seen
tremendous improvement where
the into the implemented a
lot of extra
extra help for our native
Americans.
To me it was fine
the recognition that we
have such high
poverty.
And our students
struggle.
And I knew they needed extra
time and extra money to
be able to get those
reading proficiencies and
math proficiencies
and without money we've been able to
bring in native
American
teachers and
professionals who
can.
people and want to
not only recognize and
acknowledge them but also thank
them for inviting us here
today
just very
briefly it
to 5.2 5000000
was invested into the Indian
Education Act
funds for the past 2
years this is an increase
from what historic lows
of 2000000
at 5.5000000
was allocated in the past
I have 2 years for
indigenous multi lingual
multicultural special
education initiatives that is
shared among the
I. E. T. divisions
which consist of language
and culture division.
Actually to cation Division and Indian
Education Division
at 9000000 was allocated
for I CLR
at 8 at culturally and
linguistically diverse
instructional material and
cultural developments
ends in the fall during the
onset of the pandemic
head allocated
as Chromebooks to
22 tribes in
schools that serve
significant native American
students including hot
spots and 700
residential hotspots for the
Navajo Nation those
hotspots were renewed for an
additional year I'd
just very briefly thank
you.
To say to me that we
don't have anything on impact aid
on here.
And madam chair
we thank you for solving
impact aid and I've got
a really nice power point
presentation about impacting
we'd be happy to share that with
you. Thank
you for bringing that up
on slide number 8
is a summary
of supports
for at risk students
and doctor borough
did talk about the almost
tripling of funding for the at risk
factor and
we do have awards
to out for 59
school districts on planning
grants page
line is a quick
summary of
some of the financial
measures have that have been put
in place the second ball
at there have been
improvements from Pat on the
RFR process
and we are working on improving
the process for
award letters and I
will
recognize
Assistant Secretary so
she has figured out a way
to get the money
for the pueblos much more
and tribes a much
more quickly and that's
part of what we need to do across
the board on
page 10
is a summary of
some of the supports that
you have provided and what Pat
has done for
students with individual
education
plans.
Slide 11
is a quick
summary my going too fast
madam chair we were
okay okay
I is about English
language learners
and particularly the
work we need to do
and it's a lot of work
to get culturally and
linguistically
responsive
curriculum
into not
into the schools but
right here in the frontal
cortex of every single
one of our teachers so
when they're interacting with kids
that's what comes
out.
Tribal libraries
is something that
is the work has
started that's on
page 12 and
we had quite a few conversations
last week in the G. to G.
with tribal leaders about this
and I know that there's a lot
of work to do
the next page is a
graphic display of some
of the the
program programmatic
measures that
are moving forward on housing
Martinez and W. secretary
Santa will pick just
a couple of examples.
Good morning madam chair members of the
committee I
just wanted to give
one additional example
that and I'm
just gonna go for
her video it really
brings to life a lot of the
programs and how we
hope that districts
align them so
for example she talked about
K. 5 plus an extended learning
time program and
community schools so
what you saw was a district
taking advantage of all of those
programs aligning them
to really address
culturally and linguistically
responsive education
in her community and
utilizing her equity
council and also
the council's as
we quote you know requests in the
Indian Education Act Hispanic
Education Act so that all
of those things are aligned and
come alive at the the local
level
comment schools
is another district that has done
that for the past 2
years and
if you were to see a video of their
program you would
see that students
are mapping
out the mines there working
with local engineers and the
forestry service to
actually program
they're like little helicopters drones
that go into the mines in the
forest and the map
out the community that they
live in and so
we're really excited about this work
and see the alignment of
these programs really
addressing
the the court mandates
and the only other thing I would say
that really addresses the professor
we heard this morning.
We're starting to work on and
have been for some time
and we're in the project development
of pilot project
of SB 96
and so his words really
resonated how do we
define at risk
expenditures how do we
make sure that we're really
clearly districts about how to track
those expenditures and then
post them
publicly for all to see
so they were transparent about
those kind of
funding
alignments thank
you.
Madam chair I'm now on page
14
we are.
Darting today
going to listen to your feedback
about Yazzie Martinez and then
will implement over
the next month some
consultations
to get feedback about
this 100
page document so then we
can move into
specific action
steps
and be accountable to you and
report back to
you and and
to the
the judge
about this
madam chair yes me to talk about
at risk factor would you like me to move
to that this is what I'd
like you to talk about that
particularly in light of what we
heard with the first presentation
okay
what doctor borrow
shared with you this
morning
made a lot of sense to me and
the comments I have to share with
you as a school district
superintendent build
on what he was saying
so
first of all back
when you passed if my memory
serves correctly was House Bill
5 were you put the accountability
measure in about 3 years
ago I
knew as a superintendent
that I was responsible to
you to report
how that money was being
spent and we
spent hours as a
team writing up
our at risk factor
report on how that money was
being spent.
And during
those
meetings we
had several conversations
about our frustration
about the definition of at
risk and
so I
think doctor borrow
in and proposing
some ideas and helping all of
us think about whether better
ways to define
that the word at risk I
think is good I'll just
add that
as a superintendent
there are
ours first of
all it's really important
and I and you know this but I'll just
say it out loud we
never ever
should label a
kid at risk labels
are not valuable we can
talk about it at risk factors
but let's be really
careful about how
those words are used
secondly
there are students across
New Mexico today who
don't fit any of those
criteria
mobility or
poverty or English
learners for
native American students who
are at risk of
failing not
graduating
and quite often
it's because of their
family situation.
If you are a student
in a family situation
where you don't have parents
or grandparents they can
pay attention to you every
day with the getting
food and and clean
clothes and taking
care of the basic
needs you're not
going to make it and succeed
in school
so madam
chair I do welcome
the opportunity to work with you
on thinking through
how best to
define
at risk because
it is a very complicated
situation in our
schools I
appreciate that and and
just for your your
information we do have
a LFC
subcommittee specifically
dedicated to put the public
education
piece of our budget that's
being chaired by
Representative excuse me
Senator Gonzales
Representative
Sweetser.
And the people that have been selected
to serve on that are
generally those that have
a a foundational
background in public
education whether
serving on school boards
or serve on the public
education standing
committee you know those
kinds of things we've asked
them
to help us with this
process I strongly
encourage you to
start working with them getting on
their agenda
but I I am curious
at the end of the day.
About this funding formula
being changed
in and reviewed
we we just heard and
and you've.
You've basically agreed
with that we need to have
a better definition of at
risk that's a big
piece of that budget that's a big
piece of the formula.
So have we been for the last
several years flying
blind so to speak and
hoping that those
definitions
have been determined correct
correctly at that local
level because at the
end of the day it's house
rolled out at the local
level. But
I'll come back to some questions
I want to let the committee
jump in here let's start with Senator
Gonzales.
Yeah.
But if.
Thank you madam chairman
of a
to have quite a bit but I'm
I'm gonna keep it real to a
level so allow of
the other members for the
questions.
First of all
madam chair and members
of. You
know I feel very
proud and
I have no problem in
saying the
poor state you know I'm
really glad that
Dr Kurt Steinhaus
has been selected as a
secretary.
And this is way overdue
and now going way
back I'll just be very truthful
he was always my choice
you know and so
you know I think
we're going to see a big difference
because you know
just knowing
of knowing him and
knowing his work and you know
knowing what we've been through
well you
know it's going
to be different
and and we need that you
know we really do
of madam chair on let me
start by this so.
And you
know trying to you know
so like the way
of. Our
former
Senate finance cherries to
say let me give you some institutional
knowledge it'll make a
very brief.
Is so when
the the state
equalization funding
formula
was.
The sign for
state.
It was one of the best
in the country in fact it was
recognized.
And of course
you know well maybe
our part
in our miss is not
having a provision to
were maybe every
5 years every 10 years
it should be
reinvested.
So during the
time that we have had
this.
Is so.
There's been times so we have
had studies.
And then we come to
or you know the
studies
the the the ones I've been
involved have always taken
very let the end
of the we need to go there
you know we have a lot of the information
already that if we were
to look
at this you know going
to that direction
what happens is so
that it becomes very
territorial
you know your secondary teachers
become well we don't get enough
your elementary teachers your
special ed
and the you know the list goes
on.
But in the listening
to this
morning.
And I don't know if this is
the direction that we would want to
go but you know I
think that we are really
at the point that we really need
to revisit you know
our state
equalization funding formula
you to waste
you know one is still not
to stop
what we have but
then get something else
the place in lieu
of well what
we see with our court
order.
And.
You know and then from
there you know I also feel
that it would help that.
Of the discussion this
morning you know from
all our presentation
that was done by
professor Stephen
borrow.
Is it really
leads.
To and the at
risk to
become categorical
funding.
And the this is not the first
thing that we have with our funding
formula that's categorical
funding you know we have
a other things
and I'll just give you an
example I mean it's hard to
compare one with the other
but it works
you know for example our
state Trent our
transportation system that
we have a public education
is categorical
funding. You
know so what Q. but does
it Silver City does
send Gallup it's the
same funding formula
and it works
I feel that that's something
that needs to be looked at also
because of what
has brought to my attention
this is because of the number of
charter schools that we have
now you know and it
needs to be revisited
but going into all
the statements of what was
being said you know it's really
leading to categorical
funding the
madam chair what up what
up I would like to
discuss with the doctor Stein
houses
sell.
The possibility
of taking like 2
to 3 districts.
And get a
model.
And this model would
be presented to us
is pulling all the
at risk
dollars.
You know for this districts
because what happens
is the minute that
you know as a statement was saying
that those dollars are not flowing
to at risk students
is you're going to have your
superintendents committed
or I don't have enough
dollars for counseling I don't
have enough dollars for social
service I don't have enough dollars
for this
and that's the part that we
need to look at so it's
very hard to
make that on Justice calls
to them you know
with those understanding that
part but if we had some
modeling you know what is the
school district look like pulling
all the at risk and
keeping them categorical
and then of course you know whatever
you do just that the sign of what to
work with you know
that's that's a different
story but you know you
just talking about the dollars you
know just to in that
and this is so one
suggested that I have because
otherwise so
we can sit here for hours to
listen to a lot of superintendents
and saying what they're doing
we really need to see you
know the model
part of you know how those
dollars are being designed to
for at risk so
that's one thing the
other part that
that I really feel
that needs to be looked
at this
and not hide from it
is cash balance.
And the other one
is speech to reach
you know how can you
improve you
know that.
Part of
trying to recruit.
You know in this area so we
need some top top
education
and we don't have a place for them
to leave. You
know and by now we should
really be seeing that
statewide because
of the urban
parts for
cost of living is very
expensive they're just
as a much needed as a
very rural.
The other one and it was
mentioned very lightly
you know but here
again you
know you don't have
anything if you don't have
that component of
parents you
know that component of parents
us to come in it
has to come in with training it
has to come in with the design
you know and really working
with that so
madam chair of you know
well these are my
thoughts and I have a lot more
but you know I can work with that with
the doctor Stein house
and
very proud to say that
all we are in the
right direction you
know the other part that we have
to take into consideration
is so when
you're seeing that
vision.
You have to see the whole picture
because right
now we're in good hands we
have federal dollars we have a
high level of funding
but what happens in the years that we
don't. You
know and you don't want to be at
a level 2 were
the years that we're
drawing that we
COVID take away
you know what we built
so those are all into
consideration plus
so a review of
the study of the funding
formula to update you know
would be up in the right
direction also thank
you.
Already thank you senator of
represented small thank you
very much madam chair thank you to
all the presenters
first I'd like to begin
with secretary designate
Steinhaus
how did
PED
interact
how did you interact with PED
how to PED interact
with you in
the at in the
at risk
administration
following the
2019
session and and
obviously subsequent years where
we've increase that.
Madam chair representative
small
recognizing
in fact
professor borrow said this
that the public
education department does
not have the staff to do
the work they've been asked to
do so
if that's your question directly
there was very little
interaction
once a year when we submitted our
budget we needed to
submit a report
about how we use that rests
dollars and
as we prepare
that report
just the opposite of what you heard
a few minutes ago we felt
like we didn't have anywhere
close to enough money to
meet the demands
for at risk so that's
what it looked like from
and and madam chair also
add that we need to be
careful here you don't have a
representative sample of
school district superintendent sitting
in front of you
Karen Sanchez Griego is
one of the shining stars
we have as you probably
know
I think 36
brand new superintendents
so part of this is they have
just coming up to
speed.
Understood thank you very much
I I think that
that it
is so.
Then.
You wrestled within
thank you wrestled
within your
district did
you see any
poll to
supplant
dollars that might have gone
to certain
schools.
What you know in the average
so what we're hearing
today is that there
is by
and large there can be a lot of
supplanting that when there's
additional at risk dollars
that come into
districts.
We just don't know if
those dollars are going
to the school to
the classroom where they can
really make a difference
and I I appreciate
your response
about
the work with PED that there
just wasn't the
the staffing there are that
you are kind of left to your
own devices and we
see
with Cuba I just
the left to your own
devices you all
have.
Is that the same experience
that you had I guess madam
chair. That
that is really.
Kind of you all had
to to make your
way you all of this
the major way is is
secretary designate Steinhaus
said as a shining
star but
without
as much guidance or
interaction Pratt from
PED is might have been
helpful.
Representative small
yes we didn't
have hate
to say this but guidance really
at all it was kind of like at
risk and
look we have a background of
equity and worked in schools
of equity and worked on the Navajo
Nation as well indeed and lastly
which was largely in
even you know
angle since that growth in those
populations
representatives of those
communities and so we
had very little guidance we did
work we worked really hard
on our at risk
funding report back because we
we thought they were gonna really look at it with
a fine tooth comb which they should
of because we did not
want to do supplanting
knowing for sure right we're
getting this at risk money then
how are we going to be able to show
that is effectuated kids and families
in a positive way to increase their
academic performance
and helping their social
the socialization of social
emotional things that they're dealing
with so we were very
careful about that but it was
there was lots of conversation I'm gonna be
honest to this committee as
well there was a lot
of conversations of the superintendent
C. and it was kind of shocking
I grew up in New Mexico myself up from
the south valley in Albuquerque
one of my beautiful
teachers is back here my
mentor at was a
principal was my principal
teacher but and
my family's from from
up my grandparents are from
months on on 30 on mountaineer
area. And
so.
I I myself was in at
risk if you will
and so
we approach it from the
very fact that it doesn't matter
poverty and all that you
gave us the additional money to make
sure that we're gonna hire people
that are get their turn around and
support our kids
there was a lot of interracial
arguing you guys need to know this
and fighting about who was going to
get the money and where it
was going to go to
and sometimes of our superintendent
meetings would be like Yazzie
Martinez and Yazzie Martinez
and in fact there was a whole group of
superintendents who said we're
going to form our own equity
council of superintendents
in which Dr Steinhaus
sent me an email and said Hey I'd
like to join in on that as part
of the Los Alamos a
district so
also know that even within
our ranks there's division
an understanding of what we're supposed
to do for at risk kids and
arguing about even the
racial components
of at risk kids and
that's the real fact about it would they
would say you know and there is all kids
are at risk but let's
face it there are some
real challenges
in the state of New Mexico
when we look at that risk
factors that are also positive
so we
had very little guidance
and you know again
locally we have other
training and and other things and
people that we called other
superintendents we
really tapped into higher
ed that really helped us as well
so thank you for the question
thank you so much superintendent
for that really detailed and
I think
you know just first person
account again
and also from the perspective of
up to you your
district and and you've
shown the the increase
in high school graduation rates
and other things to
show that that you all
are taking this challenge
and really leading and
so madam chair seems
like we we've put the
money there but the
the guidance
a lot of the additional
work that goes with that is not there
so I guess my final question
is in
this.
Dr vero page
line in your
report you say and I'll
just say briefly
yes you're getting the
right
definition of at
risk
that.
It does not is
all that is
contingent upon one
condition one condition
is met the districts
and schools cease treating
at risk dollars
as general revenue and
instead spend them
exclusively on supplemental
services for at risk
students.
It said
superintendent signed
house the PED
team
how do
you
look to
help us meet that
one key criteria
there's a lot of work to do to
get the
updated definition
of at risk students the
family income
index as you pointed
out Dr vero pointed
out is a big perhaps a
big step forward there
but what do
you
foresee
action building so
that again the districts
and schools State Street a at
risk dollars is general
revenue and said
spend them exclusively on
supplementals to services
for at risk
students.
Madam chair
Representative small.
Why.
It the long answer
to your question just to be
very very concise
I think one approach
could be to
do what
Senator Gonzalez recommended
to work with a small group of
superintendents and and find out
what's happening the
other maybe it's the
elephant in the room
there's a lot of pressure to school
districts for
salaries and drive
more talked about this
so if the funding
formula comes
in there's
a a lot of
pressure locally
to increase teacher
salaries and that's
not simple because
the teacher salaries go
to those that are working with
at risk kids so that's
why it's going to take some work its
analysis to figure out exactly
what's happening.
Thank you all thank you very much thank
you madam chair of look forward
to diving in deeper
there and appreciate the
leadership that the
subcommittee has
thank.
And and and we want to welcome
you to LFC.
Because you'll be getting all
kinds of questions like
that and and
will be seeking advice from
you you are
the subject matter
expert on
these things so will be
will be looking to you
as our secretary to help guide
some of this let's go
to to Senator
Hemphill.
Thank you madam chair
thank you Secretary for the
The presentation
and
for making a comment
about the need
for ongoing training
for educators
and not just a one
time thing I think that's really
an important piece
that as
the school year progresses
that teachers have an
educators have
that on going training
so that they have
resources available to
them to help navigate
situations that come up
and and you really feel
like it's incredibly
important to
not only include teachers
but all educators we saw
how important
it is for
school bus drivers
to
interact in positive ways
with our students
as well and so I think
that whether you're
talking about
teacher aides
or
cafeteria staff
all of the people that are going
to be interacting with
children especially at risk
children who are
often
thank they could have behavior
challenges and other
challenges that
that make it difficult
to
responded really helpful
healthy ways if
if you don't have training
and you're and you're not seeing
the behavior as
I need to teach
a missing skills so
the more
people in the schools
that we can provide that training
to so they're responding to
kids and really healthy ways
are.
I know would make a big
difference.
I also
wanted to talk
about
madam chair at on
how important it is
that we're
we're talking a lot about social
emotional well
being for children
and providing the supplemental
services for
at risk students
often though what I see in the
schools is that looks
like individual
therapy
individual
counseling services
and so much
of children
social emotional development
is dependent upon how
adults respond
to students
and so my question
to you is what are some
of your plans to
provide
that mental health
support for our
educators in the
schools because I
really
that's what I'm hearing from
educators is
the pandemic has been
incredibly stressful
for our children but
also for
our educators in the schools
and and all of us really
and so we
need to be providing
our our educators
that that mental health
support as well
in in terms of on
going training to
and so as children
are transitioning back
into the schools
and they're
dealing with this
disruption
of predictability
disruption of
routine
it in this really
and then this environment
that doesn't feel safe for any
of us what
kind of supports and
services are we going
to be providing our
educators
madam chair Senator Hemphill thank
you for the question
and.
My direct answer to your question
is my
plan is to
take what I've learned
over the last 6 years as a
superintendent
with mental
health behavioral
health.
Addressing suicide
ideation
trainee teachers
over 6 years I
worked as a superintendent
that was our number one
goal it wasn't
math and science
it was
addressing
suicide ideation
our kids and.
I'm shaking a little bit as I
respond to you because
last week
we lost a child in New
Mexico
and
we've got to figure out a way to
address that it
it is just not acceptable
and and as you said
Senator it's it's not
just providing.
The therapy which is an
important part of it it's training
all of our staff one of the
best trainings I've been to
recently yes
it's called mental health first
aid and that teaches
adults how to talk to
children
about
their
own.
Wondering I'll
also add one other piece to
this if you listen to the
kids one of those
data points we have
is is a survey
that subset statewide
in New Mexico every 2 years
and our children who are
LGBTQ
are more
at risk and more subject
to suicide
ideation than any other group of
students and that's not
anywhere in what we're talking about
but I would like is
to listen to the students and the
data as part
of addressing and
and I'm sorry to go on and
on and on all I'll stop right there
it's it's a very
important topic and
I have learned a lot
and I will continue
to learn and I want
our public education department
staff to have that training as
well. Thank
you for that
response my other
question is in
order to focus
on.
To make sure that we're providing
predictability routine
and a really safe environment
so that we can continue
to have our
children in schools
I really feel like
we need to be investing those
outdoor classrooms
where we have
the healthiest environment
possible where we have a lot of air
flow and
this last legislative session
I carry the outdoor
classroom on
the to develop a
task force to promote outdoor
classrooms at memorial
and so I was
wondering what
we could expect to see
in terms of PED
investing and
outdoor in.
Funding for
all districts
to
be
including those outdoor classrooms
in the schools
I'm madam chair thank you for that
you're looking at to school superintendents
that invested a lot
of money and have built
outdoor classrooms everyone of our
schools and
it's easy to say that it's
really hard to work
with teachers and
principals to understand how
that can work so
yes I think it's a net
in extremely important part
of providing the stability
and the the
opportunity to keep our
schools open as you know
we need to have our
kids at school learning
in person and outdoor
classrooms is that
is one of the really valuable
tools that can get us to that
goal.
Thank you I have
a 14 year old to.
Yeah it's privileged to be
able to have access to outdoor
classrooms and asked him what's
the difference but you
feel when
you're in a classroom inside
and when you're outside in your
outdoor classroom he said
it feels safe and I
feel peaceful
so I know when
I'm a school psychologist when I
work with students
in the schools that the
number one thing that they've requested
is can we go
outside
it just is so
regulating when they're outside
Sir really hope that we
are moving
toward
investing and those
outdoor classrooms and I'd
love to have some
just a personal conversation
with you so we could talk about
how to how to maximize
that so thank you madam
chair. Thank
you thank you very
much next on the
list is Representative Hochman
Vigil.
Thank you very much Mr chair
thank you to the presenters for the great
presentation will
come acting
secretary Steinhaus secretary
designate I
I I know I said I just have
one question
Mr chair but I actually have to
the first question is going to be directed
to doctor
borrow drive
by now we spent a lot of time
today talking about the at
risk fund
formula and and
at risk students but
I want to direct your attention
to an
op ed that was
featured in the Albuquerque journal
in June and it talks
about a number of things
but specifically lost
instructional time.
And so I was wondering if you
could tell us a little bit more
what your thoughts are on lost
instructional time what
we should be doing about that I know the
of several districts have opted
out of the
opportunity opportunity to
request or to have extra
additional are it to have additional
instructional time and so I'd
really love to get
some of your thoughts and and
additional information on that thank
you.
Thank you can you hear me
yes we can.
Okay.
I I missed something
I didn't know what you are speaking
about might pop
at. In the
Albuquerque journal
where I talked about instructional
time. That
is yes
Dr.
I I I did not
mention it in my
presentation
today.
Because I.
I tend to treat it as
a loss because
it didn't happen.
As you know who is
proposed
to
make at least
the.
10 day
expect.
Learning time program
universal and then
the sorry.
For all kids
at this year.
And and that failed
in a Senate
committee.
And that are
the idea of making
the larger
extended school year
program K. 5
plus.
At universal I
don't think was ever
considered serious
today and
and so that program is
still.
I greatly under
subscribed I don't know what
the percentages
but there's only a small
percentage of
potentially
eligible
schools that have
pursued that
so it
in in my app
add.
I sent.
We we're claiming
that lots of kids
have learned have
lost
half year to a
year of learning
during the
pandemic
that means 90 to
180
days.
And and I
thought.
Universally
expanding the school
year by the
full 35
pages the 2 programs
combined with
at least have made a
start
toward catching up
but it didn't come out that
way and we've missed the
opportunity
now we'll see what's going to happen
in this parent here
whether schools really will
be able to run.
Continuously in person
through the air are
not I don't
home page variants
comes along after the current
dealt that.
But I'm
hoping that we
can proceed more
normally this
year nevertheless
I I have picturing
State the student
who was posted
be an eleventh
grade last year
and has now as
therefore miss
possibly a quarter
of all high school
education.
At. Which
seems like a rather.
Important loss we
talk about being ready for
college and
and career.
Of course there's an
even more drastic
option then
making both of the extended
learning programs universal
which would add 35
days and that would be
offering an entire make up
here but I think
that's beyond the
scope of review of
realism
so.
Thank you very much Mr chairman
thank you doctor borrow so is it
your opinion that
if we don't take the opportunity
to extend the learning
here it's user lose
it will never be able to get that time
back for the
students.
Well I I don't state
how it's going to happen
are you.
At the the
the 2028
to legislative session will
come along.
And I don't know if people
will try
to expand the learning
here universally
and may be permanently
seems to me that 10 day
expects not to be
permanent as
as well as that
for everyone.
But that
I need some losses were not ever
going to make up
now.
I I I don't know over
throwing the burden on
the community college as
a whole.
But I don't see
a way of catching
up.
Thank you very much Mr
chair
and Dr bar I
guess that's a good segue to my
second question which is in
relation to the Martinez
Yazzie Austin I guess this would include
you to secretary
doesn't stand house
we have we have a report
on on the status of Yazzie
Martinez with does this
reflect any potential
of facts that the
last year due to Corona
virus will have
on our at risk for at
risk student population
do we need to take a step back to me
to re calculate at the at
risk formula to include
additional students that may
have not made that the
definitional cut before
Corona virus but may
make it now
and what are
we. Is
there a possibility that the
Yazzie Martinez plaintiffs can
come back and
point to the additional
losses from the the 20
twenties I guess
20202021 school
year as additional cause
for.
More to be done for these
students.
Madam chair representative Hochman Vigil
doing the job and I
you can if you want and
secretary doesn't it looks like
Mr doctor doctor
bosses present
again.
Of I think you are
you there to talk about.
I'm sorry I thought but you are
asking
the. The
secretary I
question.
I I'd like to hear from both of
you ever wants to go first
fine.
At
well.
They think it the
Yazzie Martinez late
this will be happy to come back
and ask for more those of
that.
About that
and that
yeah you know we've had these
back and forth submissions
to the court where they
at that the plaintiff
said that you the
state have not done enough
and the state comes
to comes back with
a list of things that have
allegedly done
and and that even a
motion a motion
to dismiss the
case.
Because we taking care of the
situation
and that the card did not
go along with that obviously
at that I was
busy helping the plaintiffs
right affidavits on these
matters.
During those
exchanges
and that.
I don't I don't see
what the indications
are that
that a
great deal has been done
at least from my narrow
perspective as
a finance
person.
Looking for signs
of more resources
and more spending
on the at risk
kids.
As for the reasons I
explained in
my in my
in my presentation
now when when
when school
superintendents
make public announcements
that we're we're
having fiscal problems
we're gonna spend are at risk
money on
the state mandated
salaries.
What is one of those fits
J. obviously the average
it I'm not getting
that what the
what the court said they ought
to be
getting.
I'm secretary doesn't.
Madam chair Representative Hochman
Vigil to
build on what you just
heard into
to be concise with an
answer.
2 or 3 step process I
think we need to do to address what you're
asking about the first
one is as school is
starting
we would like every school
principal and teacher
to implement what I call short
cycle assessment and
find out where the students are right
now and
from there I'd
like to work on
concrete specific
actions that
address
where the students are siliceous
taken from where they are right
right there because if you look
at the data it
it's it's uncertain right
now we really don't know because we didn't
have a lot of participation
in statewide testing
and so I'm not sure
we need to back up I
think we need
to
but the.
Foot on the pedal and go
faster and harder
to work with those students who
are at risk to
find out exactly one
student at a time
what they need what we can do to
help them
with their social emotional learning
their math language and
all the curriculum areas
in a way that's culturally
and linguistically
appropriate.
Thank you Mr chairman and
secretary designate
I'm.
That all sounds very encouraging
I hope that as we
continue forward and
have more data and information
that you will continue to visit with the
legislative finance committee
and the sub the education
subcommittee because I think it's
really important to pay attention
to the facts that an entire
year at home have had
on our student population and we
had information at a
yesterday or 2 days
ago that we were missing
up to 5
percent of our total
total student population we just
don't know where those kids went
so I look forward to having
additional information from you and and
one last question I apologize
Mister chair but that
relates.
We're in delta were
hearing about lambda
if the chance
if we continue to
see students having
to learn in this environment what are
your thoughts on extended
learning opportunities
right now and and moving
forward.
Of madam chair Mike
my goal from day one
has been to keep
schools open keep
kids learning in
person and when
I met with the medical
advisory team
the for cents out of my mouth was
we're not closing schools
what we need to do to keep
schools open
and so we've got
read of the for rapid
responses we
have a brand new tool kit that went
out yesterday
it's focused on
unique
adjustments by each
school to make
sure that we're ramping up
those COVID safe
practices and
W. secretary Seneal is taking
the lead on this they keep
our schools open so that's my
number one goal and that's what I'm
focusing on the
second part your question though
is what about
remote learning of
we as a state
are in a much much better
place today
than we were a year ago
to support high quality
remote construction
and so it.
When we are forced to
do that and I I haven't looked
at the list this morning but
we've got about 18 schools
right now that are on fully
remote and
we're gonna watch that very closely
and do our
very best to provide
the high quality instruction the other
thing I just might mention
is teachers
across New Mexico have been
incredibly.
Fassel and quick on
their feet and their
we don't hear about this much but
there's been some really high quality
instruction going on remotely
this last year and I hope
we can celebrate those teachers for
that.
Thank you very much Mr chairman
and doctor borrow and
secretary designate sign
house thanks for coming to visit with us
today I think this my questions
thank you very much representative of listening
gentleman
yes.
Thank you Mr Chairman and Mr
secretary congradulations
and and you have a tough
job in and I
want you to know that and
I'm here to support you
and I'm not the expert in
education
my wife's a principal and
so I hear it every night at home
or all during the day of
of what's wrong and what's not
right and and how
it's going but I want
you to know that.
I hope you're here for a long
time because because I'm tired
of the the switching
of the superintendents and and
and what's happening we need some
stability in the
PED and we
need some strong leadership
to lead those employees
and make them get
their job done
because we hear a lot of complaints
daily through
PED I wish
we could have a consent decree
instead of a lawsuit
over the Yazzie
Martinez because then we would
know direct plan of action
and I don't think it's the court's
decision to determine what the
educational systems needs
are and how to fix it
I don't mean judges
me maybe
superintendent our center
Gonzales was a former superintendent
has the knowledge to do that
a lot of us in in the legislature
don't and you get pulled
in 20 5000 different
directions between the unions
and the superintendents
the principals and the
teachers and you
have to make good decisions and
we're here to help you do
that and so
if we need to help you you need
to let us
know
1 of the things that that that
really just Chattfield me is
is I hear it all the time is
is we set up programs at
risk K. 25
learning and they don't
participate or they don't
follow the rules are they
move their money around
and there needs to be some recourse
for those school districts that are
not going to follow the rules
and I don't know if you have that
power but we need to make
sure that that happens
so when we try to settle these
cases or try to get out of these
lawsuits because
those school districts are not following the
rules they just drag us right back
in.
One other thing is
is on money and
there's tons of money
and there's more money than we're
gonna know what to do within the next
couple years but it's
not gonna last forever.
And so how do we officially spend
those dollars in education
how do you make sure those school
districts are not just
wasting money because I've
been here and you are probably in in
the school district in 2009
when I first came in and
it was cut cut cut cut
and then we get a little rising
we get back this placements cut
cut cut and and education
is the first place in the budget
since it's almost 45
percent the budget that you
have to look to cut equally an
across the board
I don't want to do that anymore
we've talked about new revenue
streams we talked about
changing the face of New Mexico
and I don't want to do that I want to have
some balance throughout our system
as we move forward
and so I'm depending
on you to lead us in that
direction.
I really at the at
risk in and I represent
and native American district
in Gallup I may speak a lot
more now than some of those kids in
those classrooms do
but they've lost their culture and their
language but there's
not a lot of of native
kids coming in that that
only Navajo or
only speaks any they all speak
English which is the
language we've been taught
to learn and so they've
lost that language
we need to do some of that but
every kid deserves an
education and the
best education that we can give
them and it's a struggle
at times and it all
comes down to what what's
happening at home with the families
and the parents try
how successful and happy and
how good are they it
at what they're doing and what help
that they need to make sure
that their children are there
the superintendent of the
Cuba I think that's really
innovative to give them a solar
panel and and
and make sure their laptops are
working and and they have
that internet connection
that's something that that you should
be commended on because
I see that in
in everything you
can do to get those students to
make sure that they're they're
learning in some way shape or
form it may not be the best
way but it's a way
that we had to deal with
and then the other comment I want to make
is where it ran
COVID but let's quit looking
in the rear view mirror and
saying COVID did this and
comment to that and how
do we make that.
6 that Paul how
do we fix the the loss a
learning how do we how do we move
forward and prepare.
If it happens again
and get through it so
if you have any comments either one
of you but that's
kinda.
Madam Mr chair Senator
I hear you loud and clear of taking
notes
I I will work with you
on all of those issues
and I am
well known for somebody
that does not
like to refer more I'd like to
look forward and you'll see me working
on
that.
Thank you.
Thank you
Senator I just
wanted to address
Representative question
about learning loss
in that one of the things we
want to make sure we did last year
especially when there was an assessment
that we provided assessment for our
kids 3 times
so we could see what was going on
while they were in remote
and so we again in August
we again in January we gave it
again in may now granted they're
taking this at home
we had to go out there and send people
we had to work with our parents to
have them understand and what we saw
was at the end of the
year in may
was we didn't see any
growth but we didn't
see regression we can
see a lot of regression and so
that was like slow heartwarming
for us again
there's probably a lot of things that the
kids did lose but in the data
that we saw and even
initially people were like the kids
are gonna cheat they didn't need and
people didn't help them
especially as some of the families didn't know
how to you know what I'm saying do the
computer themselves but
so although it's a
negative thing that we didn't show any
growth is a positive thing in that
we didn't show me
tons of regression
and so on probably
with for school districts that have not
tested their kids there might be some
similar things that are there
because our kids when they get
technologies a big divider
and so they need that
and but I just want to
tell you that we appreciate everything
that you guys are doing in terms of that
and allowing us to be
as creative as you allowed charter schools
to be and and letting
us to be able to take those dollars and
put them into the kids thank
you.
Thank you I I just no
I hear that all that at home it and
here's one topic that really
my wife's principal at the
school just
450 students that
go to a.
Hi you but that are dual
credits kids and the kids
graduate is with associate
they started freshman I
hear this every night
and every single almost every
other day the teacher
training in the principal training
is the same training they've carried on
for 7 years so why
are we going back in hearing this
and this almost word
for word Vadim.
Why we going back and doing the same
training we've had for 7
years because they say we need
more training
that's the review me
support and but I
I'll probably have her call you
because she she lectures
me at home every night and about
what's wrong and what they have to
do repetitively in their
system instead of being
in the classroom or building with their
teachers and being in the school
of those principle being pulled out
and not getting the performance in need
I mean hers is a high performing school
because those kids are at a college
campus and again they're dual
credit but there's other kids
in other students to the principles of
same thing you you gotta drive
since state guided Gallup to our
principals meeting you're done
for the day I mean
that's almost
impossible to do but but
that's some of the repetitiveness that
I've here but anyway
we can help you we're here
to help you we want you to
succeed I want you to
exceed the the
kids want you to succeed
and you just need to know you
have our support and one I'm not
an expert but
and may I ask a lot of questions
so thank you Mr chairman thank
thank you very much we
have 2 more voting
members representative Garcia Senator
Rodriguez and
several non voting members
about 15 minutes so we should
be good the
next we have Representative
Garcia.
Thank you Mr chairman
of. The
secretary I'm glad
you're on
board
I'm glad you from New Mexico for
number one.
You know the prior secretary
was a good secretary but
we need somebody
in. In
these positions from New
Mexico to understand
the the the law of the
land Holly's of
communities of struggling
out there the space to
rural New Mexico
and Mr chairman I appreciate
what you said earlier about not
branding arc is
that as Rick
just really.
People I have a
granddaughter the
godly Levin grade
and at 1.they told her that
she was a little stroll
from the kind of branded
her.
As the mentally
handicapped physical
school so we got to
be real careful we do with our
students okay
the I got a couple of
questions you have an
Action draft
plan.
We're tribes and tribal education
directors consulted
in drafting this plan
number
one.
Thank you Representative for your
question for the
Martinez in the Aussie are
action plan it is in draft
it was introduced
during the government to
government meeting with
our tribal leaders that was held
last Thursday
we are scheduling
a series of
consultations
with our tribal
leaders thank
you.
At the to my
understanding if there
is a number of
individuals that were invited to
participate
at that level of
participation
in those specific meetings
I am not entirely
familiar with I'd have to get with the
W. secretary on
that it but
they would be invited to
the consultation as well
to work
alongside that tribal
leaders.
Thank you for that
Mr Mister
chairman of could you not
awful important that we
include.
The people that are most
involved or or affected
by what's going on in the House
Martinez case another
question I have is
was very kind of calibration
with that Mr the plaintiffs
and developing this
plan.
Mr Chairman
did.
The state did you say were the
plate is involved in
working on the any of the
of the plaintiffs with the
involved.
And and doing this plan
that you guys are doing to yet
within the scope of what we
can and cannot
do because of the
court the answer is
yes they were
involved.
I wish we could
have them more involved
in the conversations and so we're
going back to see if
asked the lawyers whether
we can directly engage with the
plaintiffs well
Mister chairman because you know at the end of the
day the people are
affected should be
involved
in the strategy of
what we're going to do with the end of the day
and you know people are being left
out the end of the day
when the state was only to the
council you know I've been in
the state for 6 years in
this Yazzie Martinez case was
already.
On so it's kind of hard
to understand.
What's going on the New Delhi
if you the people out it
it makes it really tough on them
Mr chairman one last
question.
In the plan does not include
time 8 cost funding
staffing or strategies
for implementing when will
be available to the
LFC.
Madam chair representative Garcia
hi me just back up
real quick and and then
well the answer your questions December
I.
And I'd like
to just to share
with you that I have had
success in
rolling out as a school
district superintendent here's the big
picture of what went accomplish
and then once we get agreement on the
big picture then we
start working on priorities
and then we write a 90 day plan
that has funding
about specific people
responsible what our metrics
for success
and so that's what
we will have prepared to
share with the
LFC.
Thank you Mr chairman Neil thank you
for that answer and they consider
your sure Mr
secretary I'm glad you're
on board well you're from New
Mexico and
like senator Munoz said you
know we want to keep for a
long time because you are from
here and it's very important
for students for the
kids to our
communities and
especially if you would
Sir.
Keep rural New Mexico in
mind because you know
in my district I represent
one of the rule lists and you
know a lot of my
the constituent make
much tunes out there
don't have running water
we'll have to see the and
here we are we talk about
how we're going to give them internet
and and wireless
and to supply
that to these people out there that
do not have anything
it's a real challenge
for and and you have a
full agenda and fund
the usual people
people in line
because it's very very important
thank you thank you Mr chairman
thank you very much Representative next
we have Senator
Rodriguez.
No.
Thank you they
might take his mask off for a
minute here there
we go. Good
morning good morning secretary
Steinhausen your staff
thank you for presenting
for all your work for taking on this
big job.
IBM I feel the
same I feel energized
that we're moving in a new
direction
and with new
opportunities and
new inventions
new thought process
that's always important for all of
us including legislators
let me
just.
Mention madam chairman that one of the
things at least that I
picked up from today's
discussion is
that
the at
risk funding and
again we call and at risk I
also agree with you I don't like
that term there must
be something else we can have
besides that term
because to
me.
If we contend that our system
is failing or it's broken
in some way or another then it's a
system that's at risk
that puts all students at
risk not a
few we can't
be selectively picking
out students that need special
help sometimes students
with special needs.
And lump them into an area
that is called
at risk just
because they don't have the same
opportunities as
other students
or
you know different upbringings or whatever
it may be but
that being said let
me just say that I'm happy
you're you're thinking about hopefully
finding a different term.
We are together in this
and because we've been
trying very hard
to develop
new ways
in which we can fix
this quote
a broken system that we've
talked about first too long
already we have
done we've made great
strides
individually we
have established
and develop new laws for
example even the family
indexing income indexing
bill that we passed
adjusting the funding formula
from point 132.3
I think it was
to accommodate these needs
that we see all the time
it's like looking through a magnifying
glass and seen how
much bigger they get every
year.
And then we
go and we
we expand
K. 3 to
K. 12 to K. 5
plus and
we extend we do an extended
learning program and on and on
I could go on talking about
the new things that we've done
to try and fix
the situation we believe
Warren. Well
that being said I see one
thing that to me Madam
chairman needs
to be done that.
Perhaps together
we can now work on
it and that is
the collaboration that
we need amongst
different
departments
and different
divisions not
only in education because
education is multi
faceted as we know
there's many factors that
affect and impact
our educational system and our
students.
From poverty level
to. You
name it Mandy Moore and I
won't take that much time because I
know we're short of time here
but let me just
say yesterday our staff
presented something that I think
is going to be very key
in all of this this
call the Legisla-that.
And with
that if I remember the
term correctly with
that it is part of our
performance
evaluation system
of different departments
it's a system that we've had
for for a long time
now and kind
of reports you know
the the progress and so
on the problem that I
have seen in the past in this
new system legislative that
was presented purports
to fix is
the time frame in
between
that we we've
had all the time we in for
example this new
system could
effectively
call each and
and collectively
departments.
To discuss often more
often than not the
progress of their goals
to have a mission their goals
and together
work on these goals
and determine which
areas are working which ones are
not every 2 weeks
every month whatever
it is that is decided
the department can handle
but I think we can come
and have some good results
that way and truly
somehow
look at the performance
based on that collaboration
you know if our system is
broken then we're doing
individual enhancements
to all these broken pieces
we need a comprehensive
holistic system
to look at it holistically
as a group not
individuals
in departments and so
on I have hope that we're
moving in that direction
madam chairman because of time
I know I've taken too long but
if if first acting
secretary wants to respond
briefly you may the
secretary madam chair
senator I hear you loud
and clear and
and can resonate with
what I hear you saying
I also am energized
and and half
open
you as the legislature
and the legislative finance
body write a check for
over $3000000000
a year
and we
are accountable to
you to report
to you about how we're doing and
I'm committed to
doing my very
best to be accountable to
you.
Thank you Mr chairman that's what Mr
thank thank you so much Senator Rodriguez
next we have Representative Lujan in
just about 5 more minutes
thank thank you Mr chair
and thank you to all the panelists that are
here I just want I have
a few things but I'm gonna try to
get this really
short.
In a report if we got here
today city it said that the
the there are for funds
were there is requirement
reserve for 20 percent
of his dollars to address learning
loss and
Representative date
husband he'll brought
up that it's and it's been
discussed we know that not
everybody is opted in
to
said to some of these programs
that we we have
do we know what that dollar amount
looks like.
Madam chair Representative
Lujan the
director answers no it not
at this point we
and we try to be really
concise we've got
SO 12 and 3
and the
dollar amount for just a 1 we
do know about in school
districts were directed to spend that
money on
masks and that kind of
stuff yes Sir
to which is the second
amount
I think lost almost schools was the only
district it's been 100 percent
of that money on learning loss
and because of that experience
I I rolled up my sleeves and
written a guidance document
that is almost ready to go out
so we will be giving school
districts guidance on
S. or 3 and that's by
far the largest amount of money that's
almost $1000000000
and so we will have
amounts for you
there plants
I think are due on October
1 so they're working on
it right now it and
thank you madam chair
I think managers back not
sure but
so because we have that
20 percent
allocation
in your within your guidance
are you can allow flexibility
because of all the opting
out or did schools already have to
opt into this.
Let's see madam chair representative
on districts
are not going to be allowed to
opt out they're going to be
required to respond
to the federal regulations
and roll up their sleeves and
find what's need for
kids
so madam chair you're going to
allocate those that 20 percent
of those dollars to each
district.
And mandated the USM
yes.
Thank you thank you madam chair have other
questions about it time is
short thank you thank you so much
Representative Lujan Representative my
S. thank you Mr
chairman started take a quick
second to think talked about
us Mr
secretary to retain
as I'm just going to go back to see you
the sum of all and gentle lady
of.
Because that the Martinez Yazzie
versus state New Mexico.
Thank you where the
defendants were
the state of Mexico
and what I think I'm hearing Mr chairman
is that the state of Mexico is
agreeing with the plaintiffs.
In the plaintiffs concerns and
arguments I think that's a watershed
moment
in this litigation and and I want
to thank you madam chair.
For this meeting.
Because it's it's what
needs to happen you know how do
we. In the
20 first century educate
the students in New Mexico which are
incredibly diverse and unique
on this earth you know
and so I'm really excited about that the
documents provided and the
dialogue today and
and and suing but just quick
thought.
24 credit hours just
seems a lot to
me it seems crazy that
a student had 7
classes go
for 38 minutes to
a class I mean it seems like you
need 50 minutes 55
minutes per class
there was the there was a dialogue my
Mr chairman and and the house with regards
to curriculum which is the first time
in my 50 years we've ever
spoken about
curriculum.
There was a proposal to
to add financial literacy there was a
proposal to to
take out the semester
of New Mexico history which
read Representative people the wrong
way it shouldn't
rub it rub people the wrong way if
the history New Mexico is integrated
into the entire K. through
12.
Of the system
you know that that the reason
I'm successful isn't that
I. Have a this
degree of that degree but because I love
Chicano history Mexican history
the history of New Mexico as a related
to me in my place on
this earth and I think that's the
key to educating
students in the state and
then so I think we should
take a strong look at curriculum
again during the 30 and the
subsequent 60
as to what we want our students
to learn in my opinion
financial literacy media
literacy
you know at the studies history
but also.
Budget one time Mr chairman
is is is
coating coating is
the computer language used to develop
apps websites
software would
be great to start a pilot program
for coating that we
if one school district or one school
talk coating to its students
is a guaranteed job
of $200000 a year
guaranteed
Facebook Amazon
Microsoft they cannot
recruit.
And and facilitate
migration of of folks
from India or China to fill these
jobs now and
it's a market of the future that that
is a guaranteed employment
guaranteed
future income for our students
and we thank you Mr chairman thank you
thank you very much Representative
and very clear
sound also with our
mass last final
question goes to senator
Tom and just one
question please and I know
we can't AODA the the
sound sounds like
it's coming through perfectly
with our masks on
to thank
Senator.
Okay have a very soft spoken
that I'll give it a try.
So thank you Mr chair
I just have one quick question
and one quick
comment.
On the first page of the
LFC hearing pre
fund on the
lawsuit says
the.
Schools in the Cadillac of
participation was low
on willingness by teachers
and communities
to change summer plans
how said and
it has to be evidence
based programs
requirements a big
supporter of evidence based
programming I put some
junior money into that.
This year so
the. I
was shocked and surprised
to read in the journal
about.
They did a story on this
that.
There was a reluctance
the.
For some schools to
participate in
this.
Extended learning program.
And they didn't obviously
spent all the money in
a this in the journal did
a negative
interview negative
editorial on it
so I thought to
myself this kind of speaks
volumes.
Why
why we're last in
educational outcomes
maybe that's unfair
assessment so my
question
is.
In the in the future would
you.
And be a amenable
to making this program the
mandate this
program.
Madam chair Senator
Tallman.
The. What
you described is very
complicated and as a superintendent
I have success and
failure but
the direct answer your question
especially with
that extra 10 days
that's called ELT
P. on the answer
is yes I would support a
mandate.
Thank you thank you
for being here and being in your
assistance as well as
the
superintendent.
And I have a feeling good
do a great job.
And I'm impressed by how
well you.
Sieve
educate yourself on
the issues only
been here a very
very short time then
there's a quick
comment.
No I all the experts agree that
the most important
factor in how well it just doesn't
schools the parents
is more important than the schools more
important and the money is
spent
and.
It's the extremely important
so I'm a big supporter of
the. Our
involvement
programs.
So I know I know
APS spent a little bit of money
on that but I would support
a.
Tenfold
increase.
And that
because it tenfold
increase in the parent involvement
programs get to keep parents in the
schools and
emphasize the importance
of education.
Because some of what so many too many
students
come from a dysfunctional
families and they come to school
hungry the no support from the
parents which is
so important thank you very
much and I wish you the
best to as you
proceed senator
position.
Thank you Mr
chair.
Madam chair whoever's in
charge already thank you
very much
we've had
excellent hearing today
I want to thank everyone on
the panel and and
our doctor borrow
sit it's being zoomed
in with the committee today
we look forward to further
discussion
particularly through our our
subcommittee on public
education and
not good luck
and thank you again for being here
thank you.
I am going to
ask Miss senator Munoz to
lead the charge on this next
item but
also wanted to let the committee know
we're gonna try to get our committee
picture possibly at
lunch today if we
can find a great spot
and be prepared to
climb up the hill
so anyway
Center windows.
Thank you madam chair and
try to get this through this rather
quickly.
You guys want to take those conversations
outside.
We
started.
RubyAnn are you are you still gonna
starter
Jessica.
Thank
you.
Yes anytime you're ready to
start. Thank
you.
And and to the
W. secretary at you
do have a big presentation
here I.
Have a viable
you have to run through it pretty
quickly.
Thank.
Thank.
Right.
Thank you Mr chair
members of the committee and madam
chair I'm not sure sorry
not sure who the current
right now Mr chair thank
you and members of the committee
my name is Jessica it's meant
and I'm a fiscal analyst and program
evaluator for the LFC for
the department of information
technology the brief
that I'll be presenting you today's on
top I of your
binders and it looks like
this.
This brief will provide an update
on the Human Services department's
Medicaid management information
system replacement project
which is a large information technology
project overseen by do with
enterprise project management
office.
The Medicaid management system
itself is the critical
infrastructure and software
system that allows HSD
to manage its Medicaid
operations such as
tracking and paying beneficiaries
monitoring compliance
and provisioning benefits to
Medicare recipients
according to HSD the
miser project will replace the
old system with the new federally
compliant one to support
over 76000
providers process over
40000000 transactions
and ensure care for over 1000000
New Mexicans.
The my other project is also an integral
part of the HHS 2020
initiative which is an
interagency initiative to develop
systems and software tools
that inter relate and work together
to deliver improved health and Human
Services so
well we'll be talking primarily about
HSCs miser project
I will also be mentioning a few
other IT projects that are
ongoing which are meant to
integrate with the miser system
as part of the larger HHS
2020
initiative.
These projects namely include the
child welfare information
system project by
CYFD which is
called the sequester project
as well it just these other project
to replace the child support enforcement
system which is called the
Caesar project
these projects have jumped
on the coat tails so to speak of the
miser project as a means to
pursue higher rates of federal
funding which is why I'll be
talking about them in a little
more detail in the context
of this brief today.
On page one of your brief
provides an overview of the
project. The
miser project was initiated
in 2013 to replace the
agency's existing Medicaid
information system to
better support Medicaid operations
and also to meet new federal
requirements that were passed
by the center for Medicaid and
Medicare services
which is shortened to
CMS.
Since its initiation the miser
project has experience schedule
delays upwards of 5
years has expanded the
project budget by almost
56 percent since
2018 with a
302.2000000
total cost estimated for
FY 23 and
it's currently at risk of
losing federal funding
pending approvals the project planning
and budget documents
in part due to the combined request
submitted by HSD and
CYFD projects.
The federal for a the federal
funding is pending
because multiple projects are
attempting to certify for cooperating
federal funding request
which requires approval from
multiple agencies instead
of just one and requires
all projects to align and
integrate with each other in
a way that complies with federal
requirements which adds
complexity to the federal
request.
Because approvals are pending
combined an estimated
93.$9000000
could be at risk including
planned appropriations of
about 76.7000000
for miser and almost
28000000 for
COS.
As mentioned the miser
project has experienced delays
and more details are provided under
the project status overview
section on page
one.
Originally estimated to complete
in 2019 the miser
project time 1 was recently
re evaluated in April twenty
twenty one to extend completion
by 5 years with the new
implementation planted
2026.
HSD had experience issues
with the previous system integration
vendor which resulted in
a one year delay in contracting
a new vendor which cause
cascading impacts to the project
schedule resulting in the additional
delay.
Delays have also been exacerbated
by the pending federal
approvals for
the seat was project undersea
where do and the fees are
project under HSD
which are to attempting to pursue
federal funding in combination
with miser.
As mentioned budget estimates for
the miser project have also
grown in 2019
the budget total 200 and
21.$2000000
which includes almost 20 2000000
in state funding that's already been
appropriated which was
intended to reflect costs
associated with the C. quest
and Caesar project collaborations
as well as other HHS
2020 initiatives
however in HSD used for FY
23 preliminary funding
request the agency noted
the total cost of ownership exceeding
302.$2000000.
My there is supported by a potential
90 percent federal funding
participation match since the
system is for Medicaid
services but pending
approvals as of June twenty twenty
1 may put the remainder of
federal funds at
risk.
If we turn page 2 of your
brief.
Additional background of legislative
starting on page 2.
As mentioned the
collaboration with other
state health and Human Services
agencies the HSD
is pursuing a more responsive
service delivery and management
system through the HHS
2020 initiative
implementation of HHS
2020 requires combined
federal funding approvals for
all the projects involved
alignment of schedule and project
activities and integration
of all the systems to ensure
federal compliance and
functionality.
HSD reports continued
communication with federal partners
to secure approvals but
concerns about cost allocations
proposed budgets and
procurement for the other projects
continue to cause federal approval
delays.
The my other system is required
to implement modules which
adds to the project
complexity and
the related system modules are
listed on the top of page
3 of your brief
all of which provide different services
and functionality to the overall
Medicaid system
I will now move to page 3 of your
brief this
includes project descriptions
for the other agencies
H. H. S. 2020
projects
including the stick with project and the
Caesar
project.
I'm a little bit about those projects
CYFD seek with
project aims to replace
the outdated child welfare case
management system
the federal government is potentially
providing a new funding
match for the project and
since 2019 project
funding for seaquest totals
45.3000000
of which 16.5000000
is from state sources
and about 28.8000000
is budgeted US federal funds
in the General probation
act however
the stick with project has experienced
a barriers to pursuing a hybrid
match which would be 90
percent from the center for Medicaid
services and 50
percent from the administration of
children and families for the
protective services portions
of that system
and it's currently pending federal approval
the planning documents and
contracts which puts their
budgeted federal funding for FY
21 in FY 22
at risk.
Another related project the
HSD Caesar project
will replace the current child support
enforcement system to comply with
federal requirements and
will hope to improve
functions of the New Mexico child
support enforcement division
funding available for the Caesar project
totals 18.5000000
of which just under 13.4000000
is federally funded.
This is our project time line was extended
in 2019 I'm sorry
from 2019 to
2024 to better
align with the HHS 2020
enterprise initiative
however recent delays to miser
and pending approvals may make these
delays worse.
If you'll please turn to page 4 of your
brief.
You'll see information provided about
the overall funding status and
total appropriations for my
there. Table
1 on page 4 shows
an analysis of HSD budget
documents submitted to the project
certification committee which
is an oversight committee
within do it
which shows that in 2019
the project budget grew by
almost 14 percent
with the budget increases primarily
coming from project management
services business
services such as testing and
training IBM be
services hardware
software and other services
such as which HSD
categorizes technical consulting
costs however
it just these FY 23
preliminary funding request
no the new total project cost
of over 302.2000000
a breakdown of this cost was not
available for comparison
but this represents an additional
36.6 percent
increase from previously certified
costs for a total increase
of almost 100 8000000
or 55.5 percent
since 2018.
Since initiation however the
state has appropriated adequate
funding based on HSD budget
request with just under
22000000 appropriated
from state sources.
HST has currently spent
120 5000000
constituting 61 percent
of the 2019 project
cost roughly 67
percent of all PCC
certified
funding.
If you please turn the page
I.
Table 2 on page 5
it shows total project
appropriations.
A plant appropriations are
listed in the federal
budget columns and the
funding actually approved and
received is in the federal approved
columns and as
you can see 10.8000000 was
planned for FY 22
but it's still pending approvals
and an additional 65.9000000
will be requested for FY
23 for an
estimated
76.$7000000
federal match that has not yet been
approved received by the
agency.
Page I also highlights
project risks in more detail
and outlines a few previous
recommendations from LFC
project
reports.
Previous LFC evaluations
and report cards note that the
complexity of the project
presents potential risks
as well as the large
budget.
If you'll please turn to page
6.
Independent verification and
validation or IBM
V. for short also
publishes status reports on the
project usually
monthly and
IBM the monitors and assesses
every aspect of an IT
project from inception to
completion and as a best
practice to identify high risk
areas early on in the project
I've envy helps to inform
LFC report cards which are
available in
appendix.
During the 2020 June 1
June assessment period
I've envy Reports rated the
miser project yellow or
moderate risk which
demonstrated improvement from
previous months because they were
able to execute the system
integration contract in
may of 2021
which is an essential component of the
system's functionality
and as mentioned was contributing
to project
elites.
And despite improvements to the
overall project risk status
however I. B. and B. reports
continue to identify pending
federal approvals as a significant
factor affecting project
health. Do the
importance of not losing federal
funding the IBM the
vendor escalated the project
budget health indicator to
a high risk reading for June of
2021.
All know talk just a little bit about the
status of the federal funding
request for the project
which are also referenced
on pages
I.
I'm HSD received conditional
approval from the US department of
health and Human Services in
March of 2021
which provided 3 months of funding
for mines are project activities
if the state can meet the terms and
conditions within 90
days HSD
then responded in may.
Then further communication from
federal partners in June
twenty twenty one requested
additional clarification regarding
the project's cost allocations
and procurement methods
both were continued requirements
that were not met with HSD
and CYFD is may twenty twenty
one response.
If federal approval is not
obtained the miser project
is at risk of running out of approved
federal funding within the next 4
months according to I. B. and
B.. Lack
of federal approvals could also
jeopardize subsequent federal
funding for maintenance of the systems
and could exacerbate project
delays. If
you'll please turn to page
7.
As noted on the top of page
7 despite delays to
the project schedule however
HSD is showing continued
progress on a majority of
recommendations outlined in
previous LFC project
reports.
Table 3 shows the status of
agencies progress on these
recommendations for
example HSD reported
progress on upgrading the
integrated master project
schedule and
has
has added some of the system
integration deliverables to
that schedule so far
an ongoing progress includes
providing quarterly status updates
to the LFC which pause
during the pandemic but have resumed
in July twenty twenty one
and as well here we are here to
provide an update
today.
Overall HSD should continue
to provide those quarterly status
updates about the project to both
LFC and to do it
and agencies should continue to
communicate with stakeholders
regarding the federal requirements
and the request for information from
CMS in order to
continue moving forward with the
project without placing
additional federal funding
at risk or causing further
delays to the project
thank you madam chair members of
the committee all now pass it over to
HSD for their
presentation.
Can you hear me okay
so we're talking through
the mask but
I'm gonna try to project
good morning my name is Carrie are the
how I met deputy secretary
of the Human Services Department
very happy to be here today to
talk to you about the Medicaid
management information system
replacement project
the short name for
that is one I'm sure you'll appreciate
we call it miser
and so
we are pleased to be
here I want to just do a quick round
of introductions and
the good news is we are not
presenting all of these slides
so we will keep it
as brief as we can
on wanted we've tried
to our
agencies chief information
officer Shaun
Pearson
and then on the other side we have
Joseph tag the
miser project
director I also
like to call your attention to
secretary how term Lopez
who's joining us virtually this
morning secretary
Scrase is not able to be here
but because the project is governed
by multiple cabinet
agencies wanted to make
sure that there is a cabinet secretary
representative so thank you
Secretary for being
here.
Okay so okay
better yes okay
sorry about that.
Okay so we're going to
just through elaborate
on some of the things that Miss hits
then reference this
morning we're gonna talk
a little bit just briefly
about how the HSA
money prop 2020 project
is governed and IT projects
that fall within the
what are under that umbrella
we're going to give a very brief
overview of the miser project
and then we're going to dig a little bit on
the primary
reasons for the project
challenges I'm really
looking at the expansion of
scope of the project over the past
few years the pandemic
response that you all know about
and other reasons for
schedule delays and
then we're going to talk about the path
forward for the project to
add what we're doing to do some
course corrections of the Human
Services department and within
our sister
agencies.
I'm I'm on slide
3 I know
this is a slide that you've
seen many times
before this
is really the
the north star of what HSD
is trying to accomplish
we're really looking to
fulfill our mission of improving
and transforming lives in New
Mexico and the
miser project fits squarely
within our third
main goal at HSC
which is to improve
access
using tech information
technology and
our goal really is to improve
access 4 agencies
1034042
customers so
much slide for
that gives you an overview of
how New Mexico really
I'm sorry HSD really
serve half of our state's
population and so
the systems that we're building
have the impact of
having almost every family in
our state
we have done a lot of work HSD
in terms of measuring the social
impact of our programs I won't
go through to go into that but there is
a graphic that you can look
at and I'm sure
that you will become more familiar
with that over the next
few presentations that HSD
does because we're really trying to measure
the impact in terms of
meals and
I serve meals served
to and needy families
and health
services.
And with that I'm going to
transition to secretary heard
from Lopez who is
going to talk a little bit about you to
test 2020 governance
and I. T.
projects.
Thank you carry members of
the
committee
so HHS has
that governments body
so it's it's really
about working with partners in
making sure that there's by at
and that we have the
same direction and that we're all
on the same page with how
information technology and
data is going to be collected
so there is a co executive
sponsors which is of course
Dr David Scrase to
not only is in charge of
HSD that now
at the acting secretary of the
department of health of course
aging long term services
is involved with this
children youth and families
ECECD early
childhood education
so we're all very
involved as
the Sanchez
providing information
and a high level
direction on what we want to
state in addition
to that there is additional oversight
and that is
from from
do it and also from the
governor's office and
so we've been
working on projects and
I'm on slide 7
now where you
can where you see a
lot of the projects that we've been
working on including
aged just 2020
our integration with aging
and long term Services
Department client
data management system
from you know 4 of the
department of health and all
these things that we're trying to integrate
2 together and I know that
today we're really focusing
on the
Human Services department and
then Medicaid management information
system system replacement
they and M. I. S.
R. so
we're focused on those but we're
really pushing ahead
and making sure
that together we're collecting
the same type of data
that will be utilizing each
other system and really building
a platform that
works so
with that I'm gonna transition
to to Joseph
thank thank you
if.
All right thank you
Secretary.
So I'm gonna start by
giving a brief overview of
the miser project I'm gonna start
on slide 9
Mr chair
you'll see here that the miser project
is made up of 8
functional modules
it's a multi year effort to
potentially replace our
existing and then I just
this them and it's a federal
requirement to have a certified
and I just to receive that enhanced
funding from
CMS
as secretary
hotel Lopez mentioned
this project supports
over 49
percent of the state's population
and is extremely important across
all health and Human
Services agencies in New
Mexico and it really will
streamline functions
over 90000
active healthcare providers
and process over
555000
encounters each
week.
In addition to that the
system will pay over
74000 Medicaid fee
for service claims and
the miser project
budget currently sits at
$346000000
with the projected 89
percent federal
match.
Moving on to slide 10
you'll see the miser module
overview.
Currently we have
different phases of the project
some modules are in production
others are currently in
progress and then we also
have future anticipated
modules the modules that
are currently in production include
are consolidated customer service
center or CCS the
module which is an
enterprise contact center
supporting various programs
across multiple state agencies
and divisions the next
model we have in production is our
quality assurance module
which provides
recoveries for the state Medicaid
program as well as
audits quality reporting
and fraud abuse and detection
services.
The modules we currently have in
progress our system
integrator our data services
are unified portal our
financial services module in
our children's behavior health
model our system
integrator model is really
the core of the miser solution
that will provide all the technical
infrastructure and module
integration as well as master
data management or
data services module is our
enterprise data warehouse it's
going to be responsible for flexible
analytics and all of the
reporting across the
enterprise our
unified portal is the one stop
shop for members
to be able to access information
online in our
financial services module
is our claims processing
engine.
And then our children's behavior health
model focuses on
those clients within CYFD
that are Medicaid recipients as
well. Our
anticipated models
are benefit management services
model which is a provider
management module responsible
for provider enrollment and
credentialing. And
lastly are carrying case management
services model supporting
multiple HHS
agencies for K. and care
management so as you can see
it's been discussed earlier it's a
very complex project made up
of quite a few different
components.
Moving on to some of the
budget details on slide
11 the miser project
budget is broken out into
several categories based
on the module
implementations.
You'll see if those Representative
there on the left I
will note that all of these do come
with that 89 percent
blended federal
match
R. Costello cation methodology
currently
involved all health and Human Services
programs that benefit from each one
of these modules we're currently
working with all federal partners
to make sure that we are costs allocating
everything appropriately.
On site 12 you'll see a
graphical representation
of the state appropriations
thus far
we thank you for your continued support
of this project as
you can see
appropriations from
the inception through
expected
completion.
And with that I will hand it
over to
W. secretary army ho to
discuss some of the miser
project challenges thank
you.
Thank you
Joseph.
Okay so
assessment alluded to a lot of the
project challenges
from the staff perspective
and I think we agree with many
of those but we wanted to
just highlight really with the
3 core issues
are with the project and how those are
being addressed by the Human Services
department and across the governance
structure
of the HHS agencies
I'm the first challenge in
a month late 14 for
reference and the first
challenge really is
a pretty substantial increase
in the scope of the project
to make sure that we're leveraging
services across the health and
Human Services agencies and
to improve customer service
for our our
and New Mexicans that we're trying to
serve and to optimize federal
funding the second
challenge you all know is the
COVID 19 pandemic we
have really been challenged
HSD by
the pandemic and the reallocation
of resources
to meet other I. T.
needs to serve those
emergency functions during
the last year
point 5
and then third terminating
at the original system
integrator contract resulted
in about a 13
month delay
and the reason for that is because
the system integrator as Joseph
mentioned is the
hub of the project
so it has a outsize
impact on the other modules and we'll
talk about that a little bit
more.
On slide 15 we just
really wanted to illustrate
the expansion of scope
from before
January twenty nineteen
to where we are today
before January twenty nineteen
the project was primarily focused
on Medicaid functions.
In Medicaid claims
enroll in Medicaid providers
managing Medicaid members
fulfilling checking off
boxes around a federal
reporting requirements for
Medicaid really
did not go far
enough we don't think to
serve the customer
needs or
to look across the enterprise
and see where we should be leveraging across
agencies and
collaborating
since then the project has
really expanded to
focus on one stop
service for customers
across HHS
agencies to
look at how we can find a role
providers healthcare providers
across the system and manage
provider needs
you know there are a lot of needs in
the sort of non Medicaid behavioral
health space that we're trying to
resolve as well and
so this new system will
address those needs
and we really want to make sure that we're not
just checking off the boxes
around federal reporting
but really looking at getting data
and predictive analytics
to measure outcomes
and really we know
that people enrolled
in Human Services programs
are often rules for their entire
life spans we want to make sure
that the data analytics that we
received really creating
a holistic picture and allowing
us to make better decisions about
programs and services for
the for the population we
serve I'm and
then we really as miss
hits then discussed
in her presentation we want to
make sure that we're leveraging funds
wherever we can so that 90
percent matched
if we can get that we think that
that we should be going for that so
we're there's Medicaid overlap
in terms of function we're really
trying to secure that
federal funding.
Before January twenty nineteen
we were really working with 1
single funding agency at the
federal level today we're
working with for big
agencies at the federal level
and it is challenging
there's not really a playbook
and we're learning as we
go so so this is
some of the issues that this has
been alluded to
our regional project budget
was about 190
4000000 with
that 19.5000000
general fund impact
on today the project budget
is 340 6000000
with a 30 $8000000
general fund
impact.
In terms of the expansion of scope
and I'm on slide 16
we just we do want to highlight the
issues around
our funding at the federal
level we have
what's called an advance planning
document that is our primary
funding vehicle
at this point it is required
to have approval by
4 separate agencies
I'm in addition to the ones that were
mentioned earlier we also
have you know child support
involved and then
our food and nutrition
services at the federal level is
also involved because we're
trying to leverage the system
for our snack
program recipients
and then also of course the
administration for children and
families that oversees the CYFD
components we
have 28 my eyes are
contracts currently
under review with that
APD and $346000000
in federal funding so it
is it is very important
to get that federal document
approved very soon.
We are working with our federal partners
we have by weekly calls
and technical assistance efforts
under way
and the and
this is really has been around cost
allocation across the
agencies and how we're paying
for the services
combined however I will just
mention you may think that
it might be easier to just separate
all of the stuff out
the federal agencies have
insisted on one single
funding vehicle so that
is really where we are required
to head.
Additionally in American at the
labor the point too much but you all
know that HSD
has experienced
quite a heavy workload as a
result of the COVID 19
pandemic over the past
year point 5 we have unprecedented
enrollment in
our programs and I'm on
slide
18
we really had to reallocate
R. I. T. resources to
make sure that we could issue emergency
budget and maintain and
maintain our
eligibility
there are a lot of federal requirements
right now around protecting
eligibility
how we pay for Medicaid
services during the
emergency
and we really had to re allocate
those I. T. folks over
to address those issues
very immediately and that did
present a delay
we also want to highlight a lot of the
work that we're doing across
agencies to
make sure that we're collaborating which
is really highlighted the need for
interagency on
collaboration on systems even
more.
You can see is some of the numbers
associated with the pandemic
response I think you've seen those
probably before so I'm not going
to
go over those in depth
but I think I'm going to
hand it over to secretary heard
from Lopez who's going to talk a little
bit about that third
reason for delays on the
project.
Thank you I'm just
as deputy
secretary of state
stated it was really important
at the very beginning you know it's
sort of us it's a huge
project that it was small and as
we started incorporating
other departments
and getting other stakeholders
involved so that we can share
data and and
partner with information
what we expected
that that that project
to be able to
integrate and communicate
with all of the data that we
had we've had some
major challenges
as we've been talking about
one of the that challenges
to schedule delays
so
HSD at
based on the input
of the governance
body terminated its
original system
integrator
contract in April
2020 after
a series of
corrective action so
we reduction in scope
they could do everything that we want
them to do we gave them a
corrective action plan
and then they couldn't meet those
corrective action plan
requirements and the
timelines which resulted in
termination
and so we
we although we didn't want
that to happen
it Dr Scrase is always
reminded us you know we speak
find time to
do something that thank and
so we we always say
what we're gonna do it in a hurry
and I don't have time to fix it but
then when it comes back and
we haven't done it right we have to
spend all that time I fixing it
later in so terminating
that contract was a important
piece for us
to do it at
this point so that we
could on a
expand the scope
and
the make sure that we have a
contractor that that
is in agreement with everything we're doing
now the M.
S. N. M. I. S. O.
R. is
actually the translator is
the key component to what
all of our different
departments need
in order to have good
translation updated
so that we can have a one stop
shop and help our consumers
quickly and more efficiently
so. Dr
Scrase always has created allergies
I'm probably gonna bubble this and
I'm I'm gonna try it
the analogy that he kids
is is a lot like
the United Nations and
those your phone that you have
on you have people
who are
translating
the different languages so
that so that everyone can
communicate together and
that's exactly
what that does have
is 2.so
I'm on page
21.
So the overall timeline
at the delay was
13 months
what we had to do was drafted
new procurement we had
to add in the scopes
of services in and expand
the scope of service to meet the
needs of the new
stakeholders and the
investments that we wanted to
make we
had Federal
Rick review at that
procurement process which is at least
2 months then procurement
and contract negotiations
were about
buyers as 6.5
months and then federal
review I again
which was about 2
months and so
what we decide to contract
in may of
2021
and so we're
on well on our way
again but I think it's
important to to
know that I think that we terminated
the contract at the right
time and got I
provider on that that can
meet the needs of all the
stakeholders.
So I'm gonna hand it
over now to
shine.
Morning Mr chair members of the committee
Attorney attention to slide
23
and so you've heard about some of the challenges
we have with the project I want to pivot
talk about some of the
the successes we've gotten some
accomplishments so
first of all what you see were
reference on slide 23
this with this fishbone diagram
or some of the corrective actions that
we've taken related to those
challenges primarily in
the form of scope
schedule resources
better management budget and governance
and for the second time old Dick
through each one of these but these
are pretty common areas that you see
cross in the project and
these are things that projects
are often dealing
with. I'm
moving on to slide 24 agency it's
been referred to our
independent verification and
validation service R. IBV
for short as
mentioned this is a requirement
and but also a best
practice at the
independent entity that we
contract with they provide monthly
report into the department of information
technology to legislative
finance committee and also
to our federal partners
what's important for you to take away
from the slide is that the
actions that we have taken have
resulted in us reducing
risk on the project as a knowledge
by R. IBV partners
so you see in the bottom left hand
corner of the slide we've
gone from a red state
in their estimation down to a
yellow State
within this project and
likely that's a state that will probably
continue to maintain for a long time
this is an extremely risky project
as agency it's been references my
colleagues have also a
reference what's also
important to note that you see on the
right hand side just a little bit of an
eye test here
is this is the overall weighted
risk level as
noted by R. IBV
partners over
time and despite
some of these challenges that we mentioned
despite the pandemic despite
the system integrators
schedule delays in termination
you don't see huge spikes during that
time frame we've been able to manage
risk appropriately and
ensure that when risk presents
itself for issues pop up that
we that then then about
quickly. I'm
moving on to slide 251
of our major accomplishments
almost a year ago today we
implemented what we call our consolidated
customer service
center so
August thirty first twenty twenty
we implemented for all programs
within Human Services
Department and then in
September of 2020 of
the early childhood education and care
department began using the service
as well we
consolidated over
150 published
phone numbers that we had published
everywhere websites the
trick Center into to
toll free phone numbers that
customers and providers can contact
us through
we had a almost
1.7000000
contacts since we
launched that consolidate
customer service center
we also implemented 5 new
technologies that enabled us
to be able to better serve New
Mexicans
247365
so prior to this implementation
our call center functions with the
spirit so if you were calling
about transport you called 1 number
to call about Medicaid yet to call another
number and it was
only open primarily from
8 to 5 Monday through Friday
and most of the New Mexicans that we
support the needs exist outside
of Monday through Friday 8 to 5
so with this implementation they can
now access information
through automated channels that
we have available online through
chat through email to
tax we also
use the same service
to
notify them proactively
about things so things
for example renewals coming up
or Hey did you know
that Department finance
administration has a new Representative health
program to assist if you struggle
paying rent we've been able to
leverage a service to assist many
of our sister agencies.
I'm also pleased to notice it's
not public knowledge
yet but next month
we've been informed that this will not
become an award winning
consolidated customer service
center so look for more information
from us next month
related to that
announcement.
On slide 26
another 1 of our accomplishments
is the related to the
implementation of our quality assurance
Marshall this models
tasked with making sure that
Medicaid is the appropriate
payer which and often times is the
payer of last resort
and so part of that is the
implementation of third party
liability services where we make
sure that
if there are other coverage
associated with that individual
that those payers are covered in any
of those medical claims
and what you see reflected on the chart
on the right hand side screen is that
we've seen increase in
recoveries since we
launched a new service in
state fiscal year 2020
operators the fiscal year
2021.
This is a partnership also
with our office of
internal general
inspector general excuse me within the
Human Services department and the Medicaid
fraud control unit over the
office of Attorney General with
the implementation of new
fraud waste abuse detection
capabilities frock
after services well.
Expect an additional recoveries will
continue all the way through
the current fiscal year and
beyond.
And then draw your attention to slide
27
another list of some additional
accomplishments that we've we've
had just one call your attention to a
few we've
migrated enrollment functionality
from our existing them of my a
system to our eligibility
system so that we have with true
what's called eligibility and
enrollment system what that
really means is we simple Moffit
simplified some of the plan and so we
don't have
problems associated with data going
all over the place to be able to
enroll New Mexicans
into Medicaid we also
think you've heard this from us before
but we've implemented Medicaid real
time eligibility
have almost 30 percent of the
applications
that come in when people apply for Medicaid
a completely automated and at
the end of that session they know whether or
not they have have been
approved for Medicaid.
On the right hand side
and you for some of this reference by agency
it's been but our intention with
this project is not to
create or perpetuate
the silos stacks of technology
that we've had for decades
but the re use technology
which is more
efficient for us and and saves
money over the long term so we've
been able to leverage some investments
we made with the Medicaid management
information system replacement
project to benefit our child
support program in the form
of new electronic document management
capabilities and start
to get them to be more paperless
operation within that
division. And
then related to some of the challenges
you for you know we've and
we have a very robust enterprise
projects scheduled thousands of
lines associated with that that
help is our guide
for what we need to do when
we need to do it needs to do
it and then as part of some of
the challenges we experience
with vendor management we lost
of in vendor management Capgemini
we've been role in our folks through that
intervention academy and
I've seen great results associated with
that the number of turnover
date W. secretary army
hopes to talk about slide
28
thank you and that this
is our final slide we're
about to wrap up here
but what you see in front
of you on slot the slide
is a very busy time
line
I think you want to just call attention to
a couple of things that we've already
talked about the delays
due to the COVID 19 pandemic
and the system
integrator termination
but a lot of work is about to
start really happening
we're we're really gearing up
for 22 and 23
so we
expect to launch an enhanced
customer portal experience for
HSD programs
so 1 portal
you go in and you can see
all of your needs from the Human
Services perspective
that will launch in
2022
and then the children's behavioral health
model will
also be launching in
2022
and then we are looking to
watch our provider management
system for Medicaid
providers in
2023
our new claims payment
system which is our financial
services model
very innovative
wait a pathway to pathway
to simplify the
submission of claims for
Medicaid providers
that's gonna launch in
2023
and then shared services
across the enterprise will start
to be available in 2023
and really the
robustness of that will be felt
in 2024 with
the master data management
for the whole enterprise available
and the data services
connected in
the integration platform so
those are some big milestones
that are coming up in the next couple of
years the. Budget
does sort of
continue on this
path but those are
really the big things
that are going to happen over the next couple
of years with many of the
project completion dates
really slated for 2024
anything measurable sort
of noticeable impacts
happening over the next couple
of years so just with
that I think we will
conclude and be
happy to take your
questions.
Thank you thank you for presentation
Representative Hochman
Vigil.
Thank you very much
Mr vice chair chair
not sure who's in charge right now
thank you very much to
all of you nice to see you
deputy director army ho and
and that was a
informative presentation I'm
excited about the new MMI
just I think that
it's really important we get it right
because once we do and we
will this
will also change a lot
of lives in New Mexicans and allow us
to get the data integration we need to
do real time real time
tracking and assessment
of many folks across
the healthcare spectrum and
others and it's
important I think for issues
and and mental behavior health
because we're gonna be able to offer a
greater continuum of care
so thank you very much for the work you've been
doing and I do acknowledge that this
is a herculean effort
it is a massive project
and I know that you've been tasked
with a lot so I want to acknowledge
that and and
please don't take my probing
questions is that you
know
indicative anything that that I'm
not supported because I am
and I know that you you have a lot you're
you're dealing with so
I also have a lot of questions I ask that
you keep your answers brief because I'm
sure there are others that want to ask some
questions the
first thing I want to ask Mister chair
Mister vice chair
I guess this would be to you by
deputy director army ho
is who expanded
the scope of the program was that the
state of New Mexicos choice was that
that the federal
government.
So Mr
chair and
Representative Hochman
Vigil I can personally
response that and I think they will
him these over to Mr
Pearson over here
to elaborate I've
only been working on the project for about a year
point 5 so I think you may
have some history there I think
it's both
the this administration
really wants to leverage
Services across agency is
just some it makes sense to really
do that and optimize the
funding and really
focus on the customer's
experience and so
what does that mean across agencies
when were
and we were all serving the
same customer and so it
was partially led by
that but our federal
funding entities are also
directing us to move in this
direction and so
for example with that federal
funding the APD
that we talked about
earlier
one of the conditions of
approval is really around
this enterprise vision
and making sure that services
are kind of leverage
across the enterprise so that's
that's my answer I don't know if Mister
Pearson have anything to add.
Thank you very much
Mr chair and
deputy director so when
was the scope
expanded.
So the scope
at Mr chair
at Representative
Hochman Vigil
the scope really started to
expand after January of
2019 okay
thank you very much Mr vice
chair and so was the
increase in
scope
also implemented
across other states as well
within the
country.
Mr chair and
representative Hochman Vigil
a mask Mr Pearson to
respond chair Mister
chair representative I'm
not so much a lot of states are
primarily focused on their silos
so whether it's Medicaid or
eligibility for you know
very semen Services programs
were one of the few states they're
more innovative in our thinking
about this okay
thank you very much Mr
Mister chair Mister chair
and Mister Pearson for the answer
the reason I ask is because I know
that there have been
I know that one of the challenges that we've
been having is with vendors
and contractors vendors
and I know that there have been
some vendors and working other
states that have developed
an integrated dashboard
of sorts and have a little bit
more
knowledge and
experience in
implementing these types of
projects and so
I want to ask more about some
of the contract difficulties you've
been having specifically with the
is system integrator
you say that they weren't able to meet
the caps requirements can you please
elaborate on that more for me
Mr Pearson sure
I Mr chair representative often
beef the help
initially our procurement
for the system integrator included
not only the technical implementation
of the tools and software and
hardware also project
management services of making
sure that we're bringing everyone together
and sandbox it was working
well together we originally
the scope that from them because we found
out that weren't successful there
after that we had difficulty
with in implementing the technology
and so we put him on a corrective action
plan they were unsuccessful in
meeting the requirements of the corrective action
plan the ultimately with the
governing body's decision
decided terminate the contract
since then we've hired a
company with spruce
technology in partnership with
KPMG who has done this
and other states and what you notice
in the timeline we spent
a little more time than necessary
and once the necessary more than
usual in that
procurement to make sure we got it right this
time around and were very
specific in the experience
and the requirements we have for
the system integrator
okay thank you very much Mr
chair and Mister
Pearson
so is
spruce were. Working
on
the deliverables
that the previous contractor
has already given to the state or did they have
to start from scratch.
Mr chair representative Hochman
Vigil date their first
part of their work is an assessment
of the work that was completed by the
previous system integrator
so we're currently not review
SS States whether looking
at everything was previously produced
and then there are provide recommendations on
how to move forward.
Thank you very much Mister chair
Mister Pearson
so.
I've been going through your presentation
and knowing that we
have this potential 89
percent
Matt federal matching
funds we could lose
I see that some contractors
haven't even been
identified or some contracts
haven't been awarded yet
do we have
I guess a remediation plan
for that are we going to ask
the federal government for an extension
on these funds.
Yes Mr chair
Representative Hochman Vigil
our plan is to request another
quarter of conditional
funding
we are also looking
to escalate the urgency
of this so we
have engaged the cabinet
secretaries in the executive
steering committee on the
governor's office is aware
of the issues we're
really looking to see what we can
do to push this forward
we feel like we've answered the
questions we think we're at the end
of the sort of
toward the end of the approval
process but we think
it's really important
to get this approved we are going
to just go ahead and request
that additional quarter of
funding so that nothing
runs out and and we believe
that for federal agencies
won't let that happen
but I think it's really
important that we
make that clear that we need that
clarity around funding
so but I will
I will highlight that there are
contracts under federal
review that they have not approved
and so the unified
portal the customer experience
for example that is under federal
review so we've
got a lot of
things slated to
start that could fall behind
schedule.
Thank you very much Mr chair
and deputy director
army ho I see here on
page 23 of your presentation
that under the
governance section you
are I I think proposing
about a dedicated project director
position be
allocated to better assist
is that is
that I hope and aspiration or
is that already happened okay
yes. With
that Mr chair
representative Vigil just
a couple of days ago
hi.
Position here thank you very
much Mr chairman and deputy director
and welcome thank
you so yeah
I just just a
quick comment Mr
chair so
89 percent matches
is a large amount and
where the budget for the finance
committee and so any
time that we've already expended
a large amount of time and
resources to implement
a program and we are at risk of
of of
losing out on that federal match
funding it's concerning
so I I hope
that you continue to update us on the
project of this again
herculean effort
I know you're doing everything you
can but I've
I really hope that the state of New Mexico
isn't left for the big check
for the you know our big
bill having to write a big check
for a big bill for that so thank you very
much Mr chair.
Keep it keep wishing
the Representative because
of these IT projects and never
ending Senator Hickey
your next we're gonna be quick because
we plan on marching up the
hill at
1145.
I won't be that
long.
Mr vice chair thank
you Mr vice chair Mister
chair madam
chair and
members of the
panel
thank you for this opportunity
to ask you some questions
let me tell you where I'm coming
from I
spent
about.
5 years
plus on the
exchange board.
And it was a disaster
in
90.
We started out
with the cheapest
not the best.
But the cheapest
approach.
And it failed.
Subsequently we went
back
and I believe
now that we are
becoming a fully state
based exchange I'm no
longer on the on the board
but it taught me many lessons
and that's where these questions come
from there I I
know that as
the
Representative Hochman
Vigil said you have
an amazing amount
on your plate and
you're also dealing with some
of the most complex rocket
science
that we deal with on a day in
and day out basis
but we have to
get it
right.
The my my biggest
fear and and my
experience is that
the greatest
opportunity for
failure is a
poor project
manager.
And
I'm I'm I'm
catching up to speed on this
and and could you
tell me a little bit
more about who is
doing the project management
how you have that to
them what their
track record as
and how
you are going to
oversee them and
how you're going to help us oversee
you oversee them in the
future.
Mr chair Senator
Hickey
so just the
take you back a little bit
our previous system integrator was
responsible for project
management we terminated
then as one of things that they fail
to do so I agree with you 110
percent project management
extremely important we
currently have a project
enterprise project management
organization companies
name is Matt logics
NET ello G.
acts they have
done this work in many
states
they have previous history here in New
Mexico with us as well so they
were proven and the work that they've done
with this before
the way that we monitor them is
everything from our executive staff committee
consisting of our our cabinet
secretaries we have
a monthly steering committee
or that project management team
reports out various project
metrics that we
track
included everything from basics our
deliverables get completed
on time are we on track with the
schedule Xcerra
we also review their
performance monthly
and they produce of the
reports that we use and sit
down with them to review their
performance.
Thank you
Mr vice chair and and
panel to continue along
that
line.
It I'm very familiar with
yellow green rat you
know as what we all live
by but
I'm also very familiar
having produced some of it
having to have to answer
to people that sometimes you
can you can
I.
Yellow green and red
the
I I and and I'm
hoping that you
are.
Plying the
appropriate
rigorous oversight
again to the project
management
and I guess
if they are not coming
through or you have
doubt what
leverage do you have over
there what is written into
the contract in
terms
of
I hate to use word punishments
but remedies is
a better word for
them not fulfilling
and time frames in which they
can fulfill that they're getting the
project management that and again
that goes to the contractors
there overseeing
Mr chair Senator Hickey
everything up to include in
termination is built into that
contract so for
example we can
partially pay them for
incomplete or
inadequate work we
can refuse not to pay
them for any work that is
not completed to our
satisfaction
so and so forth so we have
a multiple remedies built into the
contract and part of the standard
contract template that the state in
Mexico uses for I. T. professional
services
thank you I'm gonna
Mr chairman if I might pursue
just a little bit further along
this line I
understand that they could you can
terminate a contract and they're
done
in a lot of promise
contractors is that they never
say no.
To a new contract because
you never know when the so
it's it's like
would you get your house remodeled
or you build a house
the contract is always a yeah
and then they're never on
time
and you know
in in building houses
we often have
penalties.
That matter just termination
of the contract
but we air
tight you will pay
us back.
Several $0
for not fulfilling it
rather than just terminate do we have
those provisions sure
Mr chair Senator Hickey we do we
have performance funds that
also include some of
that we
have 3 teenage that we
also build as a
as a whole back into the
contracts in
many of our contracts we also
have service level
agreements and key performance
indicator requirements to
if they don't get those
then there civil monetary
penalties enforced associated
with that as well.
Thank you Mr
chairman my next
line of questioning is
about the federal
government I
also had a lot of experience
through the co op
Mr chairman panel
as well as the
exchange
and
they are not easy to deal
with especially
CMS
you have to do a lot
of good work but they're pretty
arrogant people.
And they also have
a tendency and and
and and maybe I shouldn't say
that publicly
but on the other
hand that's that's just
the experience they always
know best.
So again
as we have that 89
percent of the contract at
risk.
Where are we developing
leverage over
them and they know
best.
Mr chair Senator
Hickey.
That's an interesting way of raising
the question in
terms of leverage over them I
think we're really trying
to leverage
our our relationship
capital with them the do
you have a I do want to
you know they they're really trying
to make this work and I I do
think that they are coming from a place
of trying to advance the
state's vision and
I do think we will get there
they have also experience a lot
of leadership changes
recently and so you know
CMS for example the
leadership just was
announced a couple months
ago so I think all of
those agencies are in the same
boat we're doing a
lot of education
and I'm really trying to
explain the project
at this point we're also looking
to involve you
know some higher level folks
and since our cabinet
secretaries have all
through understand the agent
the urgency of the funding
I think it may need
to go up to the secretaries
of those agencies and so I think
that's where we're headed next if we
can get some movement on
that so I think it's it's going to be
escalated at that
level by secretary
Scrase and secretary
the secretary of CYFD
and the the ones that were
really trying
to you know
grapple with some of their federal
funding partner so it
think it's at that
level and I
think that's the way that were
approaching the problem right
now.
Thank you panel and
Mr chair just
to take that a step
further I have also
experienced
a
the the yellow brick
road have great intentions
and and
lots of enthusiasm at the
beginning but when it gets
difficult
if we get a change in
Congress and
oversight changes and
they get under
pressure
sometimes it it there
develops a different
to
I just want you to be aware
of that and and I agree
absolutely we want to get
along with them and I sent a
little confrontational it's just because
I'm concerned
at that's my experience
with them and so I'm
just I'm cautioning
that you need a
plan B..
When plan a of
holding hands starts to
fall apart.
You need to have a plan B. of
leverage
and I
would suggest
that that plan B. include
our congressional
delegation
I have to give great
credit
to our governor
when she was a congresswoman
and are Senator when he was a
congress man who
helped us immensely
in the coop and the
exchanges when we
ran into difficulty so I
would encourage you to
bring them in
today their
staff I mean obviously they don't
have the time but
bring their staff into the
details and start
to figure out where
you might get leverage
if it isn't working.
Because you
know they have the legal
authority if we're not
meeting the benchmarks
to pull the
money.
Is just too bad.
And and if they have to the
so again I just
want to that
to be Debbie Downer here
my apologies to everyone
that I just want to be
realistic.
The that is the very
last.
He's.
Yeah I'm not gonna go there I
just 2 other quick
quick questions
are you working closely
with the exchange a no wrong
door integrating
that their program
and are they collaborating
with you
yes of this
place Mr chair and
senator Hickey we are
working very closely with the
exchange
director call Moses that
of our Medicaid program
is very involved in that
project she
comes from that sort of
perspective of making sure
that we have no wrong door for
customers insuring a
stream of coverage the
seamless coverage spectrum
for them and so that
is definitely our vision
and we're working we
have.
Pretty frequent calls
with the exchange
folks to
meet those deliverables.
Thank you very much Mr
chair and panel something
along that line
as the exchange is now
developing has
control over its information
CMS who did all
the I. T. work for the
extent would not share
one piece of patient
information with us not
one piece and
that's again the
difficulties of
CMS so
I'm hoping now that we
both have that
that will be able to move
not only
eligibility back
and forth what's called to
turn the table
also be able to move
claims information
and one day now that we
have Schardin
knows the clinical
information
and that do you use for
see that that's not going to
be a problem.
Mr chair US senator
Munoz
Google I think that you know
division around the all payer
claims database that is
happening with serve under the
purview of the department of
health but that's
sort of part of the coverage piece
that you're talking about
we're certainly collaborating with the
exchange on the serve
on the back and in terms of exchanging
information to reduce the
turn as you
mentioned and that's going
to be particularly important during
the termination of the public health
emergency as people may
lose Medicaid coverage want to make
sure that we seamlessly
get them over to the exchange as
quickly as we can to make sure that they
have a coverage
option there
in terms of the health
information exchange I think
we're we're very supportive
HSD and really
excited about the work that's being
done there around the
clinical information
and I'm
certainly really
excited about the opportunity to
leverage that clinical
information for the
data analytics side
Senator gonna wrap this
up and maybe some of those questions
a be good in the subcommittee
it up
be happy to act actually
she just raised one other
think about I just information
is called and
thank you very much Mister chair
Mister vice chair I
thank you for the opportunity
and I again
not trying to be
difficult you just have a huge
job ahead of you I just want to
have your eyes wide
open thank you very much
thank you chairwoman
Lundstrom.
Thank you very much I wanted
to talk a little
bit about what I see in the LFC
pre I got a little bit different
perspective as to what I'm
hearing
and am pretty
concerned about it
so I'm looking at page
one of the LFC
brief the project
status
overview.
Where is where we start the
paragraph initial project
cost estimates.
And then I'm moving down
the that paragraph
estimated costs grew again
by almost 14
percent in
2019 for a total
cost upwards of 200
2020
1000000.
And as we go down however
in HSD is FY
23 luminary
funding requests to the
legislature the
agency noted a total
cost of ownership exceeding
302000000.
Kat constituting another
increase of 36.6
percent.
Hi I've got
some concerns about that and
I want to ask you specifically
about the first system
integrator.
How much was
paid.
Madam chair.
The ones that have the
information.
With a 13000000 to get
the exact figure for you I'd
like to know how much was
paid and how
much was
completed.
So madam chair for the
first system integrator we paid
13596000.
And at that time we estimated
that completed about 30 percent of the
work.
Did we pursue any type
of damages with that type of
contract.
Madam chair we withheld
payment for many of the
deliverables as part of the termination
of contract to so that
13.5 6000000
reflects work that we did approve
that they did deliver but
they've actually took
us to court and students and
felt like they were owed more because
we refuse to pay them
and that lawsuit was
just dismissed 2 months ago we
actually were victorious
in the lawsuit.
So that did go what and
then what's happened after
that with them anything or
is it is it a done
deal now madam
chair we believe it's a done deal it's
still at their discretion if they
want to try to refile
but we think it would be a waste
of money on their part.
I want you to talk to us a little
bit more about the substantial
increases even beyond
2019 when we're
building a new scope
of
work.
Sure Mr chair and Representative
Lundstrom so a significant
portion of the increases are really
due to the scope increases of
providing the
integration points for all health and Human
Services agencies and programs
you heard a lot mentioned around
C. Y. C. in their C. was
program child support
is all of our Department of Health
ECECD an aging a long term
Services Department we
recognize that there significant
Medicaid population overlap
between these agencies
and bringing them into scope
only maximizes the enhanced
federal funding and really is
the largest portion of of
the increases that you see
there so now
do we have a break down of
that of what these different
scope the scope
changes are by agency
we do we're actually working with
our federal partners on that cost
allocation methodology
which clearly breaks down all
of the federal financial
participation by benefiting
program.
It says in this brief the federal
partner has not yet approved
the recent schedule and budget
changes as of June twenty
twenty one is that
true.
The recent schedule
changes have not been approved given
the fact that we are in a
Representative request for additional information
for our most recent
advance planning document which
houses that information
so that means that you're
moving along with the scope
of work.
And it hasn't been approved yet
by the Feds does that is that
what that means
Representative Lundstrom all the
work that's currently
on going has been approved by
the feds okay
the what is this page so that
is not been
approved.
Madam chair representative
I'm we
it's it's really The New York
but that'll close yes
ma'am I'm it's really
do work that's slated to
begin so we have
got multiple contracts
that have been negotiated for
example are unified
portal contract
that's under federal review we
cannot move forward and we won't move
forward until it gets federal
approval several
contracts like that we've got
a we're getting ready to negotiate
or we're actually in negotiations
for financial services
model that is
our claims payment system
for Medicaid and
again that's going to be that's an
federal the federal
process and we
will not move forward with
with that until we get federal
approval so just to be clear
everything that we're paying for today
has received federal approval
we're not expending one
dime that has not been approved and
we just wanna be very clear
so to be clear using
your words
what happens if it's not
approved what's the plan
B.
so
Representative Lundstrom
madam chair I
the the plan is that we have
to pause the project
we really we will have
2 pies where we
are
and I that's why I think that we have
to get that federal approval
so there's no way
for us to move forward without
federal approval obviously the
project being
$346000000
we need that federal funding
so you know we
are you're obligating
to sort of.
Within the constraints we can't
spend fund money that we
don't have and
so you
know we will I think
our plan is to make sure that we get that
federal approval our
federal partners know that
this is there's some
urgency to this and I believe
that they will work with
us to make those
approvals happen but I mean we
will have to pause work on the
project if we don't get that
approved do we
have any sense of when
that may happen.
I'm as I mentioned earlier
and we are planning
to submit a
letter I think it's
going to be a pretty strongly worded
letter about
and your request
for conditional funding for an additional
quarter while we wait for
this federal approval
if we cannot wrap this up by the
end of September so I
think we're really we received
a conditional
approval for one quarter
that takes us through September
30
at that point
we need to have
approval or some additional
quarter of funding in
order to
proceed.
All right I'm going to ask the
staff we need to stay close to
this I want I want to
make sure that we get an updated
our next committee hearing on
this because I'm concerned
about the whole issue around
approvals the whole issue
amount about what we
can we can't spend
and what the plan B. situation
is thank you very
much.
Thank you madam chair and
members tend to look at
your Jennifer you meeting minutes
we're going to do that we're quickly
right afterwards Senator
Rodriguez your next
chairman and I'm going to be fast
because I know you said we were on our
way up the hill so I'm not
sure I can finish
this correct right thank
you I just have
maybe some say
having a little background
on management information
systems and computer
science and so on I can't
help but think that
one of the most dreadful
things in my mind is that
would fall within can you hear
me I can't hear myself
anymore okay is
that we would fall within the
category that's in
our brief here
that says that
I do projects that
are.
6000000 or
more
we fail at a very high
rate and
pretty much indicating
that here it
is it's it's pursuant
to report that was published by
the General Services Department
and it says that that
it found that only 13 percent
of large technology projects
valued at 6000000 or greater
successful
and this here
is way way above that
already in that
having been here for
26 years now I have
seen administrations
come and go quite a bit
in staff changes
and as a result of that many
times we lose the
focus in these
big humongous projects that
we're working on.
That's just the nature of things
sometimes but
doesn't make it right the fact
is that we got lots of money
here this item in there
and and wanting to to
finish this project
madam chairman one of the and I'm in
and with this because of time
but one of the greatest
problems that we face
is technology is
moving as we know at
a very fast pace
and to wait 12
years from the
onset my thought is
2018 that we started
this it's actually
2016.
And
looking at that in that
and then the the
page number
12 of your
presentation 4 of
their there will be according
to this project
appropriations
request there will be requests
up to 2000
27 that's 1
2016 to
2000 27
that's a long time
that's 11 years in that
and that's assuming that everything
remained stagnant
as we know it's not going to
it hasn't in the last
several years and it's not
going to and
so the question that I
have is a 300 2000000
that we're looking at
is not going to be
nearly enough.
Because if we look at it between
now and 2027
things are going to change costs is going
to go up the just
a lot of the modules of the system are
going to become obsolete
who knows what kind of system we will
meet in may all be all in one
chip. By
David and and who knows
what else will be available
could be. In
the cloud or whatever
satellites but all I'm
saying is that
this is huge and I and
I know that you're trying your
best to get this done and with
changes as we said coming and
going it's hard
but so we to see
the realistic picture you
know and I don't know
4.we we we
really need to do this how far
do we go with this
and we don't want to start all over
either it's huge
in that respect so
it's a big project thank you madam
chairman morning think I'm to spend
to the this the
information I I
for all right
is there any other names
on your list Senator no
that's it I I just had
one long answer
question
looking at your page
21 it looks like
that's a $44000000
increase in that
contract.
In so that alarms
me and then he looks
in the Senator Rodriguez
and say the timeline
27 till
2027.
I I just
I don't know how agencies
and I understand how these contracts
work and what we have to do
how can you bind this is the
legislature just automatically
spend the money in income state at
all you're just gonna have to pay
this that becomes a
big issue for me
and holding those contractors
the fire when you have a
budgeted amount and you have
you actually have records on your
contracts which I hear
have you ever.
Got any money back on
recourse have you ever got
any product that is can
be completed in any
time line and allow long everybody's
been there in the
agency that completed
said it's working it's up it's
running we just need to upgrade to
that we ever had that
done in this
agency.
Mr chair if I understand the question
correctly you're asking if we ever
had success with
implementation that
is Representative read any
yet here I yes
yeah Mr chair is not been in
a state government for 20 years pretty
much most of that and I do we
have
and you know a lot of that
success is is dependent
upon what the goals and outcomes that
you stop us at the beginning of the project
and what you're hoping to achieve
we're still going to hit those goals and
outcomes of this project you're
correct in that the budget has
increased we talked about
you know why that budget has
increased and I think what
you see before you now
is corrective action that
we've taken so that we're not
gonna have the same issues
over.
And that that's really concerning to
me and I know these IT projects
are going to be continuing
and I'm going in and you guys got
to do what you gotta do sometimes about
our pool that really
concerns me the other
thing is is the
manta dollars we spend it
and we never get the the the
product in the in
and number one concern
how are you guys working with do
it right now when there's nobody
there.
Mr chair
so the
current acting secretary do
it Roger sits on the
executive committee and so yeah
this first executive director maybe
even with us last
week turnover now
the installers they for me
so he's actively involved at that
level of the steering committee level
we also have regular meetings
with the staff on a monthly
basis all of the staff
attend most of our project
meetings we have
weekly project meetings so we have a very
healthy and
a productive working relationship
with do it.
Thank you madam chair thank you guys for your
presentation and we do appreciate
you guys being here I think
it's very important for us to
sit down face to face during these
conversations and try
to understand that even afterwards
when we Domingo and and some of those
questions that are asked her
are very helpful for it when you guys
show up when you don't show up
there's no interaction in it
really stirs strain and
stress so thank you madam
chair ready thank you
senator
we're going to conclude this
presentation and
thank the panel for
present for being here with
us today
we will add some of this
of follow up to our
next month agenda
but it's my intention to
do a couple of items
here under the miscellaneous
Canadian business
section so we can
have this wrapped up
let's look at
tab
in.
M..
As a and that would be
approval of the
July meeting
minutes.
I have a motion from Senator
Gonzales do we have a
second.
Senator Rodriguez
for the July
meeting minutes
is there any opposition to
that seeing
none. Let's
go to
Representative small
and Senator
Rodriguez on that
LFC higher education
and sub Committee July
report as soon Representative
small did you wanna make a
comment.
Have we need your
money.
Thank you very much madam chair
madam chair it's a
concise and
accurate summary of
the minutes for
the July
22
subcommittee meeting
and at the appropriate
time I would move approval
of the subcommittee okay
we have a motion for approval
does the Senator Rodriguez
have any comment.
I think that was great thank you
also accept the motion
okay so she seconded the
motion is there any
opposition to the
approval of the higher education
subcommittee July report
seeing no that's been
approved let's
talk about to the LFC
contracts David what
have.
Chattfield.
And.
We have openings for Google
analyst right now talking
to the Michael thanks for
Google analyst including an
entry level analyst
to do the judicial
branch of
we're still looking and we're
still.
Beating the bushes to try
to find folks
but so far we haven't found the right
ones and so this
is a proposal to bring on
contract
and HanikaOrtiz
who is an analyst for us for a
long time and has the
ability to come in on a
contract basis
and ensure that as a as
a analyst for the
fall if we're able to find
a prominent analyst we won't
need to use this and will
revert the money but
this is giving us
a some security is
the budget cycle starts
on September 1 that we can
continue the work that needs
to be done so I'm I'm
request recommending
20000 for
missed HanikaOrtiz to
be a backup analyst for
the session.
Senator Campos
incentive motion for
approval
Madam.
You know on on pandemic
bow on the F. I. R.
contractors we have 5
contractors
David I want to look at
we we've had issues this session
with the F. I. R.
I want to bring that number up
so we we can get some
relief during the session on
those FIR is so
we're not seeing the word
indeterminate we're not
having legislators
go back and question
you know the staff of
our staff when they're
already overwhelmed of what they're trying to
do in the budget and put those
together I want to
see if we can either get more
contractors what that number's going
to be in in maybe at the next
minute meeting bring
that up I don't know that
I contractors of
54000 maybe want to
double the number
just just so what are FIR
is that correct in in
that we're doing justice
to to built in
into our staff so they're
not getting pressured and overwhelmed
by their legislators to make their of
our eyes the way they want
to.
Mr.
Madam chair and
Semenya's
I'll look at that it
is hard to find people who
are qualified you can come and
hit the ground running on
that but we will
again on that also
shake the tree and harder look
for more people we know
already one of our
legal experts is not
coming back that's the goal and you
know that the what happens
sometimes when you get retirees
they do it for awhile and finally they've
had enough but but I
I've I've heard the comments
about timeliness and
quality of FY are so we'll be
thinking about how to boost our
efforts in that way.
Okay all right we have a
motion from Senator
Campos for approval in the
second from
Senator Gonzales
with the understanding
that that David is going to
continue to look for additional
people to help us with
this idea I I
agree with that we've heard that in
our caucus a little bit too
on the.
Complaining about possible
problems of FIR
circuit markets more the
timeliness I think is
what it is so we have a
motion and a second is there any
opposition to that motion
all right with the
contracts I want to
hold off on the budget
guidelines until
tomorrow thank this
is what drives what we
do.
Everybody got this last
meeting everybody supposed to
read it I don't know if that's
happened but we're
going to take this up as our first
thing tomorrow because
this is struck this is what
drives our budget
building process for this
next year so
the FY 23 budget
guidelines to be the first side we
take up tomorrow
of right at
8:00.
Okay next to David next
to tap Q. is
the the
staff recommendation
for the agency budget
recommendations for FY
23
we recommend a 3.one
percent increase
that
would.
Increase personal
service and budget 2.5
percent allowing
us to fill a vacant
position
it boosts contracts 3.7
percent contracts are up
because the FY
23 will be a 60 day
session so we need those
FIR contractors
for 2 months rather than one
month which happens this year
so so that's
extra money we need in that
line and then the
other costs
are recommended to go up by
40000 in part
because per diem
of and
per diem for.
Agency employees went up
pretty significantly
and we've had a few more meetings with the
subcommittee's.
And it's is increased
funding costs so that's
the recommendation for the
request which is due
September 1 and
then typically as
we go through the fall budget
cycle when we come to December
and make it all
agency
recommendation to you
we have an opportunity to revisit
this if needed.
All right is there any questions on
this special
Madam chair and David so we want to
increase those FIR is
in in now this
is a request on so in
December when we did our final
request we would have those
and we'd be able to have those
in active
in January
correct well this is for
the following fiscal year
so so it might
be you wanna just a request
for 23 given your
comment we'll
have to see where we on budget
in terms of of of
finding people can do the
work in
December when we
bring forward
contract proposed contract
for the January
22 session.
So we need to make them as a motion
or in this 20 really
I would recommend a
motion on the budget
committee make a motion under
the 2023
the F.
LFC budget that we increase
the FIR
analyst.
2 200
and.
54 if you want to do that
now or wait till
December.
Yeah I think what we would want to
do is let so.
Let's take note of that
I agree with it but for
right now what I'd like to get is
emotional what we have in
front of us so they can get
us a good dollar figure
George and a motion for
the past okay we have a
motion for approval is our
second.
As is the
Senator Rodriguez
is there any opposition to
that seeing none
of that's a go
anything else Davis I have
to that from Kennesaw
madams I have
I want to flag 2
other items that are
informational at
tab yes
we have the policy and
procedures manual
and this is almost all
routine but there's a lot
here and
the.
If you're interested look at over
the next month and give us feedback
and will be asking for
approval of this at the
September meeting
and then a tab
11.
I'm sorry to have
W. we
have the evaluator work
plan and their Google new
items that I think you'll understand
why they're there we had
it under the current
priority
a review of the
Albuquerque public schools
operations and finances
we've done these districts to
valuations for many
years we've done Albuquerque
in the past it's been
8 or 10 years since we've done
Albuquerque but given
some of the recent events
with the chair suggested it
would be timely to bring this
back and then
also we
are.
Including an item
bilingual and multi
education programs to
do a review on
follow up on previous
work again given the
importance of the tribal remedy
which we heard this morning
that's information all
right David the other
issue I had asked about
was regarding these are pia
are PSP's
is that in here
that's not in the
the in the evaluator
work plan I know we
look budget point of view
we'll have to work with
the state higher at sub
committee to find
ways to make sure
you get a good a good look at
what's coming down the pike
I'm not only do you
know in light of recent
activities we want
a full
review
of particularly
from UNM who's
been the receiver of these are
PSP's
and and we have heard some
information we've received a
couple of of
of. Updated
the information
but we want a full review on
that and that'll be handled by
this subcommittee on higher
ed when they get a chance
to dig into that
so we have a full understanding
of what those procurement
processes were
purposes for those funds
having out spent and what
the monitoring is on
that. Okay
so I understand that I
work with Dr Courtney
figure out how we
can supplement the work
that mark wells well as an analyst
those for the subcommittee we may be
able to get some evaluators
also helping in that review
madam chair the be good
John if you all can be part of
that to be very good
all right is there
any.
Questions on answer with
pleasure the committee.
That's.
Okay we have approval
here from.
We have the motion from
Santo Nino second by Senator
Rodriguez this is our work
program now
no opposition to
that.
Go ahead live with that
so we've got to most of
our miscellaneous
business items tomorrow
would take a the budget
guidelines first
and then we'll jump into the
presentation on the
revenue projections
what I'd like to do is to
we'll go ahead break for
lunch we'll
have our lunch first I'd like
to try to get our picture in if
we could right after
that and then we'll
fire back up but what I
have asked David
is.
The room needs to be
of comparable
for us when we come
back if it isn't
we may be in the shade
outside and I
just want you to know that it was
just a little bit
more than at least a number
of of us could handle
yesterday so
all right so let's go ahead and go
out for lunch thanks everyone.
