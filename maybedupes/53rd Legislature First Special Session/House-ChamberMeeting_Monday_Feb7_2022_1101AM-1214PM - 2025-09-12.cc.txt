Mr speaker a.
This session I introduced house
bill sixteen.
Which provided for the hiring of
advocates.
For victims of gun violence and
violent crimes.
Within our homicide division's
criminal.

force and agencies throughout
the state.

Mr speaker I do not place blame

The measures.

implications.
Mr chair Senator Kerr before the
LFC and locks in the budget.

The process.
There's no way that an important
measure like house bill sixteen.
As a fair chance of competing
for inclusion in house bill two.
I think.
That we can come into a session
with an appropriation bill.
Expect for it to be funded
without a permanent.
LFC hearing.
The interim.
If you dial.

Thank you Mr speaker does the
gentleman from Cibola county
yield.
Mr speaker I yield to the
gentleman from seven hundred.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman
as I understand this that house
bill one thirty two was
introduced.
If an appropriation.
And because of the appropriation
it was deemed germane is that
correct
gentleman from Cibola County.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
the general fund that is
correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman does
this bill still have an
appropriation attached to it.
Mr speaker and gentleman it does
not.
Speaker and gentleman when was
the appropriation on this
of Bill removed the speaker and
gentleman.
Speaker of general admission
lawn it was rebooted as first
committee hearing before it went
to house Judiciary I'm not sure
which committee that was.
Gentleman is it your opinion
that this bill is still germane
seeing as how it does not have a
message from the governor and it
does not have an appropriation.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
San Juan that is where my
problem is yes Sir.
This gentleman where do all
bills that are not deemed to be
germane because they do not have
an appropriation and because
they do not have a message from
the governor of flood Committee
is that are those bills referred
to Mr speaker and gentleman.
Mr speaker delivering some long
years since the rules.
Right away from the speakers
desk.
Mr speaker and gentleman and I
understand your request now is
to pull it off of the floor and
send it to the proper committee
which is rules of seeing how
this bill does not have an
appropriation and does not have
a message from the governor is
that correct.
Speaker division one that is
correct.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman I will be voting to up
hold your referral to roll thank
you miss and John.
Okay so we're gonna go to the of
the gentleman from Chavis the
end result.
Mr speaker.
With with a high I suppose the
gentleman of the of making the
motion yield.
Mr speaker General from Chavis I
yield.
On your motion I think to
myself.
How many other bills does this
affect do you have any.
Other bills in order in your on
your order today that are up for
the same motion question.
Speaker gentle and not that I am
aware of.
Mr speaker if if I could as a
member of the house
appropriations and finance
committee.
I believe it is a rather regular
van.
For bills to have
appropriations removed.
And I would suggest to this
body.
If we have legislation that has
been introduced.
That it is almighty late day.
One of the bill is scheduled for
final passage on the house floor
to say groups no appropriation
because members there are many
bills that are coming that have
already gone under this
pretense so please bear that in
mind and I urge a no vote thank
you.
Is there further debate.
Gentleman from San Juan.
Thank you Mr speaker Mr speaker
the gentleman from civil yield.
Mr speaker I yield to the
gentleman from Sierra Mr speaker
thank you general.
Question about Germanus with
regard to appropriations.
Are you familiar with that in
turn general opinion that says
even though there's an
appropriation of thirty day
doesn't necessarily make a
germane Mr speaker John.
Mr speaker and gentleman no I'm
not.
Could you enlighten us on that.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
seaboard States Attorney General
opinion sixty six dash oh five.
And it does state that the mere
fact of having appropriation in
of itself does not necessarily
make a bill germane Mr speaker
and gentleman from civil of
what's the role of the rules
committee in determining these
type of bills.
Speaker and gentleman off the
role of the rules committee is
to speak to see if there is any
action there that would make the
bill provided
a either of me germane as far as
financial as far as an
appropriation or as or spending
bill and as far as a be the.
We invite the of the the
governor's mystery dinner three
day session.
Mr speaker gentleman from small
thank you for that and so I
guess what I'm wondering is if
if this motion successful this
bill gets gets taken off of the
third reading calendar does that
mean that this bill is not going
to receive a hearing is that you
can can the merits of whether
germane actually be heard.
Mr speaker and gentleman that is
why at the motion is descended
the rules at that time in rules
they will make the decision
whether it's a germane to be
sent back to the for our.
Mr speaker Jennifer Siebel given
that there's not a messenger
message from the governor.
And that the mere fact of having
appropriation of itself does not
make a bill germane in a thirty
day session in your opinion is
it is it most proper within our
rules make sure that the rules
committee makes a determination
of Germans.
Mr speaker and gentleman I could
have said it better myself.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
civil thank you for your time.
Is there further debate on the
motion.
And limited to the motion the
gentle lady from Graham thank
you thank you that is speaker
and thank you Mr chairman Mr
Chairman so the intention of
referring this to rules is to
make sure that we follow the
proper procedure and I fair and
equitable application of bills
of any reason Representative
presented by many of us during
the session is that correct.
Speaker of the gentle lady from
from from us.
The W. from Iran to the ongoing
Sierra.
Read it I'll go I did I got a
little bit of all divers yes
ma'am that is my intent on this
I just feel that that we need to
follow the rules whether we like
the bill or not thank you madam
speaker and thank you gentlemen
and I was very much moved by the
importance and the urgency of
your senior member chairman
together Garcia who gave in in
essence something similar a bill
that is very important to many
of us across the state too many
of our families and our
communities who have been
victims of homicide and his bill
actually had an appropriation is
still has not been determined so
are you aware of that.
Speaker gentle lady and I am
now.
Madam speaker and and gentleman
I was you know I just I can't
understand how the rules
continue to change other
referrals continue to change and
yesterday we heard about a
substantial appropriation house
bill two attached to a bill that
creates an accident having
appropriations so I mean I I am
becoming increasingly concerned
about the process that is being
used by the speaker of the house
in order to decide what he
refers to committee of for a
hearing and what he refers to
rules in essence to die and
Madam speaker and gentleman I
want to thank you for bringing
this to our attention and I will
be supporting your request for
this bill to go to rules that is
what the process requires that
is what is expected there is no
message am I correct Madam
speaker and gentleman that there
is no message that would align
with this bill.
Mr speaker gentlelady I that I
didn't hear a message that would
online would be allowed sorry
not missing for long throughout
the whole introduction of
messages saying that anything
about all this bill or anything
related to it.
Thank you madam speaker and
thank you gentlemen and again
you know I don't know how I'm
going to vote on the bill but I
know that I have been.
Concerned at the very least of
what I've been watching the
speaker Mr Egolf DO throughout
the session in regards to bills
that he has an opinion on how he
would like to vote on them and
so I I'm looking for a voting
for your bill thank you.
Is there further debate division
and speaker can streamline the
body we don't refer to people by
name thank you.
Thank you for that Mr leader.
Madam further debate on the
motion.
Yes.
The gentle lady from Bernalillo
Santa and Santa Fe
Representative Lord.
Thank you madam speaker Messier
Representative Daniel your time.
Mr speaker I yield to the gentle
lady.
Thank you very much Manistique
and Representative one of the
proper team introduce a bill
with an appropriation for the
purpose to be made germane
during the budget session and
just pull the appropriation on
because it was not needed.
Speaker gentle lady the only
reason that the appropriation
was in the bill this is the way
I I I figure it okay I'm sorry
this is my personal opinion if
you introduce a bill of lading
appropriation and that just so
that it can be sent forward that
I don't think it's legal if
you're introduce a bill of the
appropriation and appropriation
stays on the bill and that bill
should be and continue forward.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative I agree with
what you have to say and I have
no further questions thank you.
Is there any additional debate
on the motion.
The gentleman from civil and
McKinley.
Mr speaker.
I am going to ask I am going to
withdraw my motion but I am
going to reserve the right to
bring it up at a later date very
good the motions withdrawn we've
got the gentle lady from
Bernalillo the two delays from
Bernalillo Representative
Garrett hop in the hill.
With a memorial so go to the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
Representative Garrett to make a
motion.
Thank you Mr speaker I ask
unanimous consent that house
memorial eight be removed from
the speakers table and be made
the next order of business.
Very good gentle lady.
Hearing no objection it is so
ordered.
Mr speaker we could get me to
that point.
Members as I say this please

memorials for day we have to
Morial so on the debate of this
within the next two please be
mindful we have one from a
member of the minority one from

Townsend so please keep in mind
the time let the record reflect
that all action necessary for
placing House memorial eight
Fund final passage is been taken
gentlelady to explain the
memorial thank you Mr speaker
house memorial eight declares
February seventh through
February fourteenth congenital
heart disease awareness week in
the house of representatives I
learned some astonishing facts
when I was preparing this
memorial in my life in my own
little circle I have to family
friends.
In their late twenties who each
gave birth to little girls with
congenital heart defects that's
Madeline Michelle Lujan L.
Fulton that is reflective of the
fact that nearly one in one
hundred babies is born with a
heart defect and it's the number
one new board birth defect in
the entire world amazingly one
third of congenital heart
defects in New Mexicans children
are not diagnosed due to a lack
of adequate hard screenings
congenital heart disease
requires a lifelong specialized
care no matter what point in
time an individual New Mexicans
diagnose.
Just this memorial emphasizes
the need to be aware of and
address the needs of those
living with congenital heart
disease with the access for care
that they need their entire
lives and Mr speaker I do have
to guess it's that appropriate
to introduce my to guess at this
point.
Generally I'm I'm happy to
introduce the guest is there in
the gallery
basically name please stand up
and that is welcome you to the
house I have duper Kearns.
Media Barbara pity Robinson
senator Sanchez I wonder.
Bob Farley under K. A. far

Gentlelady you still have the
four and.
Mr speaker with the chief clerk
please read the memorial three.
House memorial a introduced
Representative Garrett memorial
declaring February seventh
through February fourteenth
twenty twenty two congenital
heart disease awareness week and
the house of representatives
whereas the adult congenital
heart association founded in
nineteen ninety eight is the
only nonprofit organization in
the country dedicated solely to
the unique needs of the nearly
two million adults for born with
heart defects and whereas
congenital heart defects are
most common are the most common
birth defect in the United
States with nearly one in one
hundred babies born each year
with a heart defect.
And whereas it Vance's in
innovations in pediatric
cardiology have increased long
term survival of children born
with congenital heart defects
and whereas for more than a
decade the number of adults with
congenital heart defects exceeds
the number of children with.
Congenital heart defects and
this number continues to grow
exponentially whereas congenital
heart disease requires a
lifelong specialized.
RT I care and whereas the
mission of the adult congenital
heart association is to empower
the congenital heart defect
community by advancing access to
resources and specialized care
that improve patient centered
outcomes now therefore be it
resolved by the house of
representatives of the state of
New Mexico that February seventh
through February fourteenth

congenital heart disease
awareness week and the house of
representatives to honor and

the top ten most violent United
States cities with a population
over one hundred thousand and
we're eyes in twenty fourteen
the homicide rate for
Albuquerque was at its lowest
with only thirty homicides
occurring that year and whereas
in twenty twenty one that right
for Albuquerque.
Increase by forty six percent to
the highest on record with one
hundred seventy Lujan seventeen
homicides and whereas victims of
violent crime feel frustrated by
the high number of repeat
offenders and whereas the high
number of repeat violent
offenders causes victims their
family members and the public to
feel unsafe and whereas victims
of violent crimes and their
family members face trauma
hardships in Greece whereas
reparations to crime victims
were ins are insufficient to
compensate victims for their
comprehensive losses and whereas
victims of violent crime deserve
honor and access to resources
now therefore be it resolved by

the state of New Mexico the
victims of the violence of
violent crime and their families
