Speaker good afternoon members I
move that we go to the next
order of business announcements
and miscellaneous business
interjections order.
Members I would like to.
Make a point of personal
privilege from the chair.
I read in the news item recently
that the New Mexico foundation
of open for open government.
is making a political issue out
of the health of US senator Ben
ray Lujan.
I was dismayed to read this
article.
In which they are attempting to
invade the privacy of Senator
Lujan.
To forces family to release.
Protected health information and
try to make political hay or
controversy out of Senator lu
Han's recovery.
I've never seen anything like
this where
nonprofit organization is trying
to raise his profile and is
using the health.
The event of an elected official
as a pawn in that effort I was
extremely disappointed to see
that Center Lujan condition is
no I think we all owe it to him
to his dear mother Carmen the
widow of the late speaker panel
on all of his friends family and
loved going to give the family
the privacy they need and
deserve.
And not to make this
said event of the stroke that he
suffered
itself a political football or a
matter of public discussion we
will learn his condition with
the family is ready to tell us
that is what I think we would
all expect if one of us for a
family member were in that
position this Senator we hope is
recovering speedily and well and
I think that the foundation for
open government should be
ashamed for trying to make a
public issue at a very private
very private.
Troubling event with the health
the senator who Lujan.
I hope they're listening.
Are there other announcements.
Already some housekeeping the
gentleman Chavis and Lincoln.
Thank you Mr speaker I would be
remiss of I did not bring up
this matter and.
For committee handbook on
committee procedures says a.
Motions to limit debate should
not be allowed in there should
be no limit on the number of
times any committee member is
permitted the state to limit
debate for the number of times
and member may speak would
defeat the purpose for which the
committee is created.
Mr speaker this morning.
We've been engaged in a very
significant piece of legislation
and government Alexion's and
Indian Affairs Committee.
Actress taken two days and and
probably should be taken on
Thursday but
It's a very debate was limited
for Representative Rehm and then
myself and then.
Representative Zamora and we
were unable to fully go through
the questions that we had and I
think that Mr speaker you could
ask any committee member and
find out that the debate that
was influence was not
duplicative.
The questions that were being
asked did not to reply all of
ground that already been plowed
and I think it was an honest
debate and yet it was cut off
procedurally what happened was
there was a motion after our
debate was cut off there was a
motion to for a do pass.
And then there was a procedural
move
That was made but I believe that
procedural moves should be made
before the motion the vote was
taken on that procedure move and
then the motion for the
substantive motion I would
submit their out of order but in
any event Mr speaker my question
is is that how we're going to
proceed for the next five days.
Mr speaker on that point.
Senator.
My my question was.
Is that the intention of this
body to limit debate and
committees.
the gentleman from.
Bernalillo Sandoval wishes to
make a comment on that point Mr
speaker I am not speaking as a
parliamentarian that's up to the
my colleague to my right
right right
the hours late last night I was
in that committee.
The fact is is that there was a
full and fair discussion that
went on for over two days.
On a bill we're all
professionals all the all
subjects anyway forecast and
questions were asked over and
over again there is nothing in
our rules.
That says there's a three hour
debate limit one way the other
it's a discussion we had that
discussion the chair announced
at the beginning of the meeting.
That we had a caucus we're going
to go an hour and a half all
questions that should have been
asked I thought were asked it
was a fair discussion everybody
had their say and then the chair
finally said we're going to a
vote.
Committee process the whole idea
of having discussion is so that
we can have a discussion it is
not for purposes of delay at the
point of the chair finally
called the vote frankly we were
hearing the same questions over
and over again it was totally
appropriate and with in the
provocative of the chair to cut
off debate and go to a vote and
that's what happened I I'm not
standing as a parliamentarian
I'm standing as a witness to
what happened it was totally
appropriated chair who by the
way was incredibly gracious and
thoughtful and patient with all
of the members of our committee.
The discussion went on for hours
and at some point the chair gets
to say enough's enough and
that's what happened thank you
Mr speaker thank you John Mr
speaker.
I think the general Chavis and
Lincoln still has a four thank
you Mr speaker Mr speaker the
questions that were being asked
to we did not reply old ground
in fact the the focus of Mari.
Lessing was more involving the
regulatory aspects of the
legislation that is an issue
that no other person brought up
during that process and I was
the.
You know about.
What forty five minutes in the
to my questioning when when that
debate the cease and we went
through the other representative
so I would disagree with my
colleague from Santa that
The same issue with being beat
up over and over in fact I would
say that a conscious effort was
made not to engage in that.
We were asking legitimate
questions of the sponsor of that
legislation to show the citizens
of the state what that
legislation was going to do and
and Mr speaker of the the
question is are you is that what
we should expect moving forward
or we going to be allowed to
engage in the budget without
being cut off from that I
understand it for plowing the
plan the same ground over and
over again I understand that but
when the new
questions are arising new issues
are being discussed that is
legitimate but a debate and it
is the only way that this body
can be delivered of is it for
allowed to engage in that debate
server so I thank you for
allowing me to get that off my
chest and I hope that we go back
to of what's in the handbook and
not have of things being limited
be there in time for in one
instance the number of questions
that could be asked thank you Mr
speaker.
The gentleman the gentleman
from.
Read about what live a reserve
in San Miguel sexed.
Mr speaker.
I also sit on government
elections and Indian Affairs
Committee.
And I'd like to challenge the
parliamentarian to go back and
look at those tapes.
As Representative from Travis
county stated.
We did not plow the same ground
over and over.
And when we say two days.
The first day we were limited on
time because of other.
Bills that were be in front of
the committee.
And then today.
I actually got.
Two questions I was told I was
limited to two questions on that
bill.
It's one of the most important
bills that has come up in front
of this body.
I have constituents that are
very concerned about this bill.
And for me to be able to ask two
questions.
I didn't get to ask any
questions on the first day.
And then at the end of the
committee.
Because of the schedule that
we're trying to me.
My constituents.
Get to hear me ask two
questions.
How can I represent my people
that have concerns on this bill.
Limiting me to to questions in
committee.
I think the bill should have
been rolled over and we should
be given more time to ask
questions a debate the bill.
I don't think that's fair.
To be treated that way
committee.
And we cannot represent our
constituents and we get treated
that way.
Thank you Mr.
Senator they're further down
services the gentle lady from
Bernalillo Representative
chairman Lewis thank you Mr
speaker
I don't know if I do I need as
of the German if.
But
so Mister speaker I just want to
inform the body that like every
other bill including the bill
that was attempted to be blasted
out of my committee a couple of
days ago we take a public
comment we had a fair hearing we
had twenty minutes of public
comment from both the opposition
and the supported supporters.
Committee members were offering
a lot of comments
due to the time due to the
time we spent on the floor last
night we had to move our
committee from noon to two PM so
that our members could get some
rest.
I asked our committee members
that they would be respectful of
everyone's time on the
committee.
Which is something we always
strive to do and I think we've
done an excellent job of being
respectful to all members of the
committee.
Members had time the night
before to speaking to the bill's
sponsor.
I think we started the floor at
eight PM and we ended at six AM
and there was a lot of time to
talk to the to the committee
sponsor at that time.
There was a proper motion on the
floor.
And once
we got to that motion.
There was more debate and then
there was a proper motion to
move the previous question which
we all voted on and then went
back to roll call of the.
We had a two thirds vote with
the majority of
Which is a two thirds majority
of the committee to move that.
And and masons Mr speaker the
previous question maybe move to
use may be used to close debate
on any debate of a motion.
So I just wanted to bring that
to the body's attention and
thank you for the time.
The gentleman chairman Senator
thank you Mr speaker.
Mr speaker I would offer this
Madam to the body for
consideration.
We heard in great.
Detail the other night.
How the committee process should
be held and respected and how
how important it loss today we
hear just the opposite we hear
that in some instances enough's
enough.
And we don't have time for that.
That's what I just heard the
other thing that I heard that
was.
Adding to me is when.
Members of my caucus.
Who have stood.
And then respectful every time.
And there what was just said
was.
Bank talk too much.
They asked the same questions
over and over.
And these gentleman just said
that wasn't true they weren't.
Allowing the same ground.
They were digging into a bill
that has dire consequences in
their opinion on their
constituents I have already had
calls from constituents that
said had did you watch that
committee.
Did you see that they shut
mentoring Representative library
that they wouldn't even let.
Representative Zamora aspen to
questions.
Mr speaker.
The rules are the rules.
I know sometimes at this stage
of the game they're
uncomfortable.
I know sometimes.
The only tool that the minority
has at this time and we utilize
that and it's frustrating get
over it that's the rules.
That's the way they work.
It's not fair Mr speaker.
You know better than that.
I expect you to do the right
thing thank you Mr speaker.
Folks the let me just say and I
want to do this for the floor
leader leaves the floor.
I was with the entire membership
of the committee.
three or four days ago.
I can't comment on what took
place in the committee this
morning.
I didn't see it I got people who
are saying it was quick too
quick I've got people saying it
was thorough well done I've
heard people say there's two
days of hearings on this bill.
all the things that we're
hearing folks discuss is the
epitome of you know it is in the
eye of the beholder.
Folks on one side are gonna have
an opinion folks on the other
side are gonna have a different
opinion I think the wise thing
to do especially in light of the
other night in which almost
every member of that committee
set up to congratulate chairman
Lewis for being the fairest most
even handed in among the most
respected committee chairs in
this entire legislature house
and Senate.
I think that should be kept in
mind.
I think we should instead of
trying to convince one another
of the righteousness of our
position on either side.
We should let the people of the
state watch the video and draw
their own conclusions I don't
think anyone over here is going
to convince you that it was
perfect you're not going to
convince folks over here that
there is a great injustice done.
Perhaps we can
Take a deep breath.
I think you can also say since
you've once again accused me of
being unfair I think without
basis.
The government you that is been
eleven hours since we concluded
a marathon session in this
chamber.
I presided over session in which
every member was allotted a full
time to ask questions in my
humble opinion I think the same
question was asked on bills.
Dozens of times.
I think in my personal opinion
the the debate that we had in
this last session
there was a times tedious.
We didn't say a word and we've
just heard that you know it was
intentional.
Effort to use what you said is
the only tool you've got which
is time.
So you know I think we just need
to be open and honest with
ourselves if that's what's going
on.
And I'm not going to supplant my
judgment for the sound judgment
of the gentle lady from
Bernalillo.
Who's been congratulated
repeatedly and recognize
repeatedly for being the epitome
of fairness and evenhandedness
inter Committee.
In the need of the chairman
Chavis and Lincoln and I just
discussed that the other day.
What would a good shot with a
good job she's doing that
committee.
So you know we can try to re
litigate something that happened
that almost all this did not
witness.
We can try to get folks around
the it's probably a better idea
to express our viewpoints and
let's move on to see if we can
come together and find an agenda
that we can get behind to try to
move some business forward I
noticed a few things that you're
interested in doing gentleman.
As a few things folks on this
site are interested doing but if
we're going to get into this
sort of fight.
In the first minutes of the
opening of this session.
We're not gonna get much done to
the detriment that everyone in
this room the next I have the
job of Sandoval Representative
Harper.
Thank you Mr speaker hi
Rise and I appreciate the
comments that were just made.
I just want to say.
When I was chair of the ways and
means committee.
We had several bills that the
majority of the time to doctor
Preciado.
And we I made a very conscious
effort to make sure everyone
could speak their piece because
that's essentially all we have
when were the minorities the
speaker piece we often go back
to the same member.
And we would take a long time
debating bills is bigger there
was a time that I carried a
pretty hefty bill house before
twelve.
We were accused on the floor
going giving a twenty minutes of
debate.
But in committee we gave it
three days and ten hours.
Mr speaker and I would just ask
that we.
Respect each other and.
The perhaps overly fair.
the rules do say we don't want
to debate in committee and I
know any of us when we're told
Hey.
You only have a couple questions
you can ask that.
You know we take that personally
because we really feel that it
is our obligation to the folks
representative will ask those
questions.
So.
the speaker I I can appreciate
what to do said I hope that we
can move forward respect each
other and the rules and the
rules were designed.
So that's a major.
We'll get there.
provocative.
but the rights of the minority
would be protected the release
bill to speak thank you Mr
speaker.
Chairman Chavis Sarinana terror.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
and I appreciate your comments
but I have to remind you Sir
that last night.
Within the first hour of debate
you came over here Razin Kane.
Because we had debate going on.
That Representative Lane was
leading.
One thing that I think was very
important.
And I change my vote on that
bill but because of.
Representative.
Comments I had never considered
after voting for.
Representative lines.
The bill that he was caring and
committee I have never
considered.
What Representative Cook brought
out about the first amendment
rights.
It was.
Very.
Insightful M. and it also.
Not a whole new perspective to
the.
The bill that was being proposed
so.
Appreciate your.
Your committee that we should be
considered.
Mr speaker I remember last night
thank you Sir this gentleman in
in just so we get the whole
story here.
As I came over begin with yes we
have the Chief Justice of the
New Mexico Supreme Court on the
floor.
The minority whip and told the
Chief Justice of the area that
you're going to delay voting on
the bill for the purpose well it
is true Sir.
And I asked if you could please
limit the debate so the Chief
Justice who was on the floor and
nearly eleven PM could drive
home Albuquerque.
I said we'll we'll stay here as
long as you want but on this
bill and on this bill alone
could we show the respect to the
Chief Justice and proceed as
expeditiously as possible so
that he did not have to stay
here late at night.
And in general that's what
happened.
I'm sorry you felt that I was
trying to do something improper
but I was not raising Cain I was
going around asking members if
they could expedite the debate
solely for the sake of the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court who
is on the floor.
And gentleman.
It is true.
Well okay.
Okay so we'll go to the
gentleman from Lee.
Thank you Mr speaker
From the point in conversation
right now.
Mr speaker I think that we can
all agree that the pandemic has
created some problems within our
system and Mr speaker last year
I watched as we went through
three plus maybe hours of
participants one minute comments
in committee.
Mr speaker this year I've
watched when
in my opinion.
There's opposition to it.
Thanks committee those comments
are limited to a very specific
time frame.
I do feel like there's this cute
here and I do feel like we need
to make sure that if we're going
to portray this concept of
transparency and open government
that we need to make sure that.
People that are participating.
That way for a multitude of ours
Mister speaker all of on the
phone to be able to talk for
their one minute get the
opportunity to do that.
Mr speaker.
Bye bye take the minority
eight comments to heart because
last night to I change my vote
on Representative lines bill.
Mr speaker through debate in
committee I change my vote vote
from my original committee the
to what will happen on the floor
at least three times already the
purpose of debate the purpose of
continuing this is to be able to
get the points out to where at
some point in time maybe we can
find a common ground.
Mr speaker I I.
It disappoints me to see some of
the things that we're doing with
respect to this.
So that we can finish of a
certain time so that we can do
this so that we can do that.
I appreciate Mister speaker the
concern that we have for our
Chief Justice but at the same
point in time for all elected
officials will like to go home.
So.
That comes with the territory
with the job Mr speaker I
appreciate the opportunity to
speak thank you.
Thank you gentleman gentleman
for someone.
Thank you Mr speaker
President point of personal
privilege.
Mr speaker you brought up the
point of what happened last
night and I would like to you
said the rest of the story and I
would like to have have the rest
of the rest of the story Mr
speaker.
And Mr speaker early on
during the first bill as is.
Custom.
At this time of the session
we have members the the the the
majority floor leader and.
RT would come over during debate
of the first bill.
And say this is what we want to
get done tonight these of the
bills that we want to get done
tonight.
And we look them over and we
offer back comment as to what.
The minority is willing to do Mr
speaker that conversation was
had.
Mr speaker there was one bill.
One bill that we suggested be
rolled until this morning and
what we suggested Mr speaker was
that everyone of those other
bills could be handled in a
reasonable fashion.
If we don't get run over.
That was the that was the at the
very beginning of the evening
what we were told was.
No all of those bills going to
go through even more the one Mr
speaker that had a very strong
they had a lot of legal
ramifications and it and it
never went to Judiciary Mr
speaker.
Thank you Mr speaker that's what
happened last night and so when
we were told no you're going to
be run over not in those words
but Mr speaker in actuality
that's what we were told.
So Mister speaker there was a
conversation that was had with
the Chief Justice which was at
that point we've been told we're
gonna run over.
And you're gonna like it.
And we're gonna push you into
submission.
Mr speaker that was the reality
of the political events that
took place last night and when I
spoke to the Chief Justice I
said.
Mr justice I am so sorry showed
up on this evening at this point
because we're having to fight
for our rights.
We're gonna do that.
And the new Mr speaker that he
did not have to be here for this
is that a fact Representative
lane express that to the Chief
Justice on multiple occasions
and those of you who watch the
debate realize and those of you
have watched Representative Lane
debate here on this floor
realize that it.
Representative Lane usually does
not need an expert witness as a
matter of fact I believe only on
two occasions was the Chief
Justice even asked the question
Mr speaker the Chief Justice
wanted to be here on several
occasions Representative Lane
suggested that if you needed to
go home he he could go he which
he did not have to be here he
chose to be here Mister speaker.
Mr speaker that is what happened
last night.
What happened last night is what
happens typically at this point.
The the minority has to stand up
and fight for their rights and
Mister speaker I have the
previous Representative
Representative Brown Barone Roni
who was a more coronial field
and I was replacement when
Representative.
Of the body Gonzales was
elevated to a Senator and he was
put in place and Mr speaker
point of order no one gets
elevated to the Senate.
All there was a lateral move Mr
speaker okay I I stand
corrected.
Mr speaker when that happened in
the same situation that we're
facing today Representative
Maroney pulled me aside and said
why are you guys fighting are
you guys just slowing things
down why don't you negotiate the
Mr speaker as I look at this
list today this is what I I did
this when I was talking to
Representative brownie I said Mr
Representative.
What is there to go **** with
nothing that the Republicans
fight for in committee makes it
ever out of committee to the
floor the only way Mr speaker
that a Republican's bill gets on
this floor is if they are on a
bill with the Democrats.
Whether it's a Senator or a
another representative and so I
showed him as I I I ask every
member to look at this yellow
sheet today and look and see.
How many Republican bills are
actually in here there's nothing
to negotiate for.
So Mister speaker the only thing
that the minority is able to do
is to.
Slow down legislation.
So that the majority has to pick
and choose do you really want to
do some of these things in here
that we all agree upon.
Want to push through as many
controversial bills as possible.
Mr speaker that's what happens
over and over this time of the
year this is why this battle
takes place Mr speaker.
There is the opportunity to work
together it has not happened in
in four years it has not
happened.
Mr speaker I I thought I told
you Representative Brown he said
I just compromise why don't you
just.
Work with the majority and and
Mr speaker when there's nothing
to negotiate with that does not
compromise as surrender.
Mr speaker of I I am I am not
the with on this side so that we
can surrender our rights and I
am very disappointed in
Representative Ely is comments
about this morning.
The suggestion was.
It was determined.
Thank you have a fair amount of
time to speak it was determined
in my opinion I believe is what
he said.
And so that's all it is a it is
that the majority and in there
and in the opinion of the
majority.
You should just go on with us
and Mr speaker that is not what
I'm here to do and that is not
what the the minority is here to
do Mr speaker we are here to
represent our constituents and
we're going to do it to the
fullest extent of our ability
and if that means staying up
every night all night.
The representatives on this side
of the chamber willing to do
that thank you Mr speaker.
Thank you gentleman for gonna
jump from billion to sorry that
you.
Are not highlighting when you
and I co sponsored the produced
water act together.
Gentleman from Bernalillo.
Thank you Mr speaker I move we
go to the next order of business
reports Mr speaker I've been
standing over here for some time
this is not the second time I
have been heard it's getting
very frustrating.
There is a way to be recognize
it is to stand up it is to put
your name on the board you're
not the rules do not permit was
a call in the gentleman from
Bernalillo he has the floor I've
been here for about a ten minute
to second would you like to hear
me finish my sentence go ahead
but if you Bernalillo he has the
floor at that point makes a
motion to the next order of
business that is not a motion
that you any members allowed to
interrupt the person who's
speaking which is the gentleman
he had the floor will have an
time for instance miscellaneous
business leader I recognize the
gentleman and that is why he has
made a motion to go to committee
reports that is why I'm going to
ask for to read twenty percent
privileges is second time I've
been Norton or something to look
over here for one hundred nine
point two times now hear from
you a point of personal
privilege is not in order.
At this time I'm.

Gentlelady from Bernalillo are

Thank you Mr speaker you got me
to that point with the record
reflect on should necessary for
placing House Judiciary
substitute for house bill sixty
eight on final passage has been
taken the gentlelady to explain
it all.
Thank you Mr speaker house
Judiciary Committee substitute
for House Bill eighty six
responds to requests from law
need.
My apologies Sixtyeight.
Responds to requests from law
enforcement to provide them with
useful tools to curb gun
violence.
Crime especially violent crime
involving guns continues to rise
and it affects every community
in New Mexico.
This bill recognizes that crime
involving guns are inherently
more violent and that we need to
ensure our sentencing schemes
are tougher on the most serious
of violent crimes.
Addressing crimes through
tougher penalties is only part
of the solution the other part
of the solution is working to
prevent crime from happening in
the first place and that's why
the budget passed by this
chamber is so important.
Unfortunately as of today there
are critical gaps in our
criminal code that must be
addressed and by closing these
gaps the legislature can improve
public safety and ensure that
our criminal laws target the
most dangerous criminals in our
society.
Making our communities safer is
a statewide issue and requires
both long term and immediate
solutions we must address this
issue in its entirety and
providing targeted commonsense
solutions is the best way Mr
speaker I now stand for
questions thank you generally
first over the gentleman from
San Juan in the meantime there's
been requests for folks to
remove their jackets that is
perfectly fine.
Representative.
You Mr speaker Mr saves speaker
will the gentle lady from
Bernalillo yield.
Madam speaker I will yield to
the gentleman from San Juan
thank you madam speaker thank
you Julie from Bernalillo
madam speaker I just want to
first I guess.
Maybe make a professor asking
questions because I think
there's a lot of miss
communications around what this
bill does and does not look I
think there's genuine
misinformation about this bill.
The bill is dropped additionally
is much different than the bill
that is in front of this body
currently on the floor and I
think that's an important
distinction for members to know
before we both that there have
been some substantive changes to
this bill through the committee
process and madam speaker gentle
lady from Bernalillo I will also
highlight that we appreciate
that that this is gone through
the committee process and it's
been vetted properly in my
opinion and that the Sanchez
been open to some changes so
madam speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo can you describe some
of the differences from how the
bill was originally dropped
verses the version that the body
is going to vote on today.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman the most significant
change is that section two in
the original bill and has been
removed and that was the section
that that change the definition
of from or the statute from
school premises to school zones
and as that section has been
removed.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo so there's nothing in
the current version the bill
that would make it unlawful to
carry a firearm through the
school's own is that correct.
Madam speaker and gentleman
you're correct.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo thank you for the
clarification I want to ask a
question on the new crime of
this creates a criminal threat.
It's on page two.
I believe this is now called
section one Madam speaker gentle
lady from Bernalillo the way I
read subparagraph a it looks
like this is trying to target
threats that are.
targeted at this what I would
consider
Places of public office
occupation is that correct.
Madam speaker gentleman yes that
is correct Mr digitally from
Bernalillo can you talk to the
body maybe a scenario or
scenarios that this type of.
The language this type of new
criminal threat is designed to
prevent.
Madam speaker and gentleman
A.
Real life example of of.
What this section is addressing
is a true threat made to.
A school.
For a place of worship for a
business.
And madam speaker and gentleman
from Bernalillo and and I think
the time and also is it has to
be with intent to cause some
kind of either physical injury
or damage to property is that
correct.
Madam speaker gentleman that is
correct.
And madam speaker gentle lady
this creates a new for three
felony is that correct Madam
speaker gentleman that is
correct.
Speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo and for those who are
tracking the debate last night
and I think this this type of.
crime and penalty that that is a
associate with the crime is
consistent with the crime at
this body passed out last night
with regard to judges themselves
the ideas trying to to curb
these kind of threats against
those that would cause harm
physically.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo led to look on page
three at section two now.
The minister gentlelady from
Bernalillo just so the body is
clear.
can you explain what the new
languages doing here in section
two.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman
of the section two of the house
Judiciary Committee substitute
inserts the language in on sorry
on page three aligns twenty
three and twenty four for
participating in a lawful
shooting activity.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo so just to be clear
what this section is is doing
subparagraph a the same
basically it's it's on lawful to
possess a handgun
and last one of the following
sections apply this concept that
it's unlawful to possess a
handgun that's already an
existing statute is that
correct.
Madam speaker and gentleman
you're correct that is existing
statute.
And madam speaker gentle lady
from Bernalillo and so this
carves out individual exception
that if if the the person is is
in a lawful shooting activities
are correct Madam speaker and
gentleman yes you're correct and
actually this was one of the
secretary suggestions that came
up during the very thorough
Committee process and was
incorporated into the committee
substitute.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo I would I would next
like to turn the ball is
attention to page six in the
bill.
Paragraphs the.
As in Curtis can you explain
what this new language does
Madam speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman this is a new language
differentiates a serious violent
felon that is found to be in
possession of a firearm.
Currently the statute only
applies to all felons in
possession and this is a
recognition that serious violent
phones in possession of a.
May require stricter sentences.
Minister gentlelady from
Bernalillo so do I it's so
important for me to in terms of
contacts and know what is
current law versus out of this
changes so madam speaker
generated from Bernalillo under
current law even if I'm serious
violent felon if I'm found in
possession of a firearm I'm
guilty of a third degree felony
is that correct.
Madam speaker gentleman that is
correct Madam speaker gentle
lady from Bernalillo and so the
statutory changes this this bill
then would bring is it from the
coasters violent felon now
instead of being a third degree
felony I would I would be
charter the second degree felony
for unlawful possession of a
firearm to understand the
correctly.
You madam speaker and gentleman
yes perfectly said.
And madam speaker gently from
Bernalillo can you give the
bodies of maybe one or two
examples of what what is a
serious violent felon.
Second degree murder.
Right.
Human trafficking sorry madam
speaker a gentleman.
Madam speaker Julie from
Bernalillo.
And so again we're we're taking
women my estimate we're taking a
class of individuals who have
shown a track record of engaging
in criminal behavior that
warrants them having a longer
sentence these are kind of folks
we don't want on our street so
if your and possession of a
firearm it's unlawful.
Because you are failing and then
if you are in fact a serious
violent felon then it it makes
it even longer that they would
be off the street so I I
appreciate that change.
Section for in the bill.
I think this actually is
probably one my favorite changes
in the whole bill.
By as as Madam speaker gently
from Bernalillo as as a lawyer
who's represented police
officers I I very much
appreciate this new language and
so madam speaker gentle lady
from Bernalillo can you just
explain the current law of what
happens if you're convicted of
aggravated fleeing a law
enforcement officer what level
felony that is.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman currently aggravated
fleeing is a felony and that's
because of the extreme
recklessness and likelihood of
harm however there's no increase
in punishment when the conduct
result in injury or great bodily
harm and so this check
Section seeks to address
the increased income
consequences.
Additionally from Bernalillo and
and just so the body has context
of what what that actually means
to fully a law law enforcement
officer in the aggravated since
can describe what that means
when when you're charged with
aggravated fleeing a law
enforcement officer what is
that.
Madam speaker and gentleman
accelerating your speed failing
to stop putting the public in
danger.
Mr gently from Bernalillo so in
other words we're talking about
a car chase.
Madam speaker gentleman yes and
I think madam secretary general
from early I think that's
important for we're not just
talking about somebody who the
officer yelled at you to stop
and you take off running down an
alley it's not we're talking
about here for John about you're
in possession of a deadly weapon
if you will the sense of a motor
vehicle because you're now
celebrating a high speeds
weaving in and out of traffic
maybe running through stop
lights driving a median
shoulder.
And those situations obviously
you're putting officers lives in
danger if they have to pursue
you they're putting whoever's
occupants are in danger but
obviously other of persons who
were on the roadway and so I
think these are important
changes because Madam speaker
gentle lady if you cause an
injury.
To another person how does this
bill change this charge of
aggravated federated following a
police officer Madam speaker
gentleman if you cause injury
that would be a third degree
felony and madam speaker gentle
lady and if you under this
current language in the bill if
you cause great bodily harm what
level filling is that.
Madam speaker gentleman that
would be a second degree felony.
Massacre gentlelady from
Bernalillo and again I think I
think these are needed changes
in the law because the reality
is and and and the civil side of
actually the laws has been
litigated such that
unfortunately police officers
oftentimes don't give chase
anymore because there's such
extreme liability for both the
department but then the motors
to drive recklessly and and so a
lot of times these these cases
are called off on like the old
days but again if your condition
is cut off conduct and you cause
a bad car accident and somebody
else loses their life because
you were trying to flee a police
officer I think there's and
there's an important third have
some accountability Madam
speaker gentle lady the last
section when asked a question
about a section five.
Can you explain Madam speaker
gentle lady from Bernalillo what
the current law is in terms of
brandishing a firearm.
Madam speaker gentleman's the
current law is that if you
brandish.
Firearms it is a three year
sentence enhancement
and it is only pertaining to
brandish meant.
Minister gentlelady from
Bernalillo and that's only if
it's in the commission of a non
capital felony is that right.
Madam speaker gentleman that is
correct speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo continues by the body
then what does because there's a
new subparagraph a what is this
new language to in terms of
brandishing a firearm.
Thank you madam speaker
gentleman that paragraph Hey.
It makes it so that if you are
if an offender is.
Caught the.
sorry in relation to a drug
transaction or the commission of
aggravated back of burglary or a
serious violent offence and in
this instance possesses or uses.
A firearm it is a sentence
enhancement of one year.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo so this language.
As as I understand that
explanation it keeps intact.
The concept of brandishing a
firearm during non capital
felony is that correct.
Madam speaker gentleman yes that
is currently.
In statute and that is now
section or subsection B..
As in Bravo.
Regionally from Bernalillo so I
I think that's that specific
word I think is important
because it didn't I did pick up
on that one I first read through
this paragraph of trying to sort
through why we're going from
three years to one year and
aggravated Bill of felony
aggravated
early for example.
But it's the brandishing I
believe that separates the two
madam speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo is that correct.
Madam speaker and gentleman
Yes what we are doing in this
section is.
Maintaining the three year
sentence enhancement for
brandishing but also
Providing for a one year
sentence enhancement for
possession or use and the reason
is we're recognizing that
brandish meant it is in and of
itself more violent.
Institutionally from Bernalillo
so I guess and just.
Common lingo when I think of
brandishing I think of pulling a
fireman someone is that correct.
Madam speaker gentleman yes.
Master digitally from Bernalillo
we're we're as if you if you
just.
Say you possessed a farm so I
guess Madam speaker gentle lady
from Bernalillo that would be a
scenario where maybe I have a
firearm in my possession or in a
handbag with me but I never pull
it out the victim never sees it
or feels threatened by it is
that this are we're talking
about.
Madam speaker gentleman yes
Madam speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo so I I I still think
that.
Type of conduct is worthy of
having syncing invest because
the reality is you have a farm
within your reach and even
though the victim may not be
aware of it they're still that
additional risk of life to the
victim Madam speaker gentle lady
from Bernalillo I do have a
question though about the word
used.
So subparagraph faces want to
separate finding of fact by the
court or jury shows at a farm
was possessed or used.
In relation to their drug
transaction aggravated burglary
how is using a firearm different
and brandishing a firearm
because branching again gets
three years but if it's use
that's one here can help me
reconcile those two.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman the difference is with
brandishing you're pointing the
gun at your intimidating use is
having the firearm on your
person
Thank you madam.
Message early from Bernalillo so
again I think the possessed for
make sense I'm still a little
concerned about the word use so.
Is Brandon is that defined
elsewhere in statute or maybe in
some case law that that does
flush that out first that makes
it different and this concept to
be used.
Madam speaker gentleman one
moment while we pull up to the
definitions of both brandishing
and use.
Massacre generally for Berlin
please take time.
Madam speaker and gentleman by
employing the term uses the
legislature requires something
more than merely being armed.
Madam speaker gentleman but
brandish is a more narrower
term.
And madam speaker gentleman and
the term brandished is defined
on page twelve beginning line
for.
Brandished means displaying or
making a firearm known to
another person while the firearm
is present on the person of.
Present on the percent of the
offending party with intent to
intimidate or injure a person.
Madam speaker gently from
Bernalillo and that I think
Brenda's make sense to me and
I'm.
I'm generally not training of
the bill but I just want to make
sure that we get this used part
right because I I think we're on
the same page we want to avoid a
scenario where
The defendant is arguing well I
used in Senate brandished and so
I'm just trying to reconcile the
two different the difference
between those two terms.
Position make sense to me were
you don't make it visible the
victim.
The use I I tend to think when
you use something it's it's part
of what you're doing in a reason
to accomplish a purpose and so
I'm just trying to avoid a
situation where they the
defendant quote used a firearm
during aggravated burglary and
only get a one year sentence
enhancement verses if they had
brandished it but not use that
they actually did three years as
a sentencing enhancement so I'm
just trying to reconcile those
two things madam speaker
gentleman's if I could find a
little bit more elaboration on
the term used
The court had held.
That the a gun in a defendant's
waistband was quote used as much
as the gloves and ski mask he
wore in his attempted bank
robbery.
Madam speaker gently from
Bernalillo and I think actually
might be helpful it and maybe if
you're explains I apologize but
I believe you have a the maybe
in ADA here with you today
and and another gentleman would
you mind just explain about your
experts are.
At madam speaker gentleman's
thank you very much for calling
that to my attention I apologize
for having forgot to do that yes
I have assistant district
attorney James Grayson from the
second judicial district and
then I have deputy secretary of
the department of public safety
Benjamin Baker.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
early as I think that's
important voting no because I
don't I don't plan the Serena in
terms of the law I don't I don't
prosecute these kind of offense
is not the kind of law that I
practice just the my common
understanding of use I think is
where I'm hung up so let me ask
the question this way then
speaker gently from Bernalillo.
According to your experts to
actually prosecute prosecute
these kinds of things.
Is using a firearm is that a
term of art.
That is different than
brandishing a firearm as the
courts interpret those two
phrases.
Madam speaker gentleman yes
master gentlelady from
Bernalillo and so.
Prosecutor the judge the
instructions the jury all those
will take would contain clear
explanation to differentiate
between brandishing and using
during aggravated burglary
secretary.
Madam speaker gentleman yes that
is correct the madam speaker
gentle lady and I.
I'd I think I understand it's a
little bit more but I if if if
you can answer maybe one more
question for me it would be
helpful.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo would.
Do your experts feel that it's
important to include both
possession.
And used.
Has a one year sentencing
enhancement and if we don't
include the word used.
There might be some scenarios
during aggravated burglary where
a firearm doesn't receive an
additional sentence enhancement.
Madam speaker gentleman's both
of those terms are used in case
law.
House speaker gently from
Bernalillo so I I guess the
short answer short short version
the question I asked is if we
struck the word used is that
going to be a disservice to the
prosecution.
Madam speaker downtime and
it would not necessarily be a
disservice.
Madam generated from Bernalillo
and so I.
I guess I'm I'm.
I don't I don't think I'm the
only one in the in the in the
chambers that maybe has some.
Views are concerned around.
Possessed verses use so.
Your experts are and and.
You madam speaker gentle lady
from Bernalillo.
If it's maybe not necessary in
order to avoid confusion how how
married are we to this for used
phrase.
Madam speaker gentleman's the
reason that it's in there is
because it follows the federal
model however
It would certainly be.
My expert witnesses think that
it would be fine to be removed.
Master gentlelady from
Bernalillo some I'm not aware of
the the federal.
Of statutes.
I just think in for C. a crafty
Defense Council trying to to
leverage the difference between
Houston and brandished and
trying to avoid the one versus
three year sensing has been
since so master generated from
Bernalillo.
In your expert opinion that
would that would be easier to
prove.
The three year brandishing
enhancement.
If they didn't have to worry
about this idea of used being in
the new language in the bill.
Madam speaker and gentleman it
is not going to be more
difficult to prove brandish
meant.
If we retain the word use.
Madam secretary generally from
Bernalillo so I.
I don't believe the point but I
I do think maybe just the last
thing I will would ask is
minister gentlelady from
Bernalillo in your expert
opinion if if we remove the word
use doesn't make the bill
better.
Madam speaker gentleman
my experts agree that removing
the word would make it clear.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo would you be open to
a four minute to to strike for.
Used on page nine line twenty
two.
Madam speaker gentleman yes.
Minister gentlelady from
Bernalillo thank you I
appreciate your your hard to try
to make the language in the bill
is as clear as possible.
madam speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo I think what I'll do
I'm at the end of my questions
all work on preparing an
amendment and I'll just send it
to another member
and they can they can offer the
floor then I don't I don't need
to do it so that way and in
terms of expediency and not
delaying.
The question on the bill all all
of stop talking to reduces thank
god for that right and then I'll
go offline and work on striking
those two words and then we'll
circle back at some point on
that thank you madam speaker.
There's further debate the
gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln Representative Nibert
thank you madam speaker.
The gentle lady from Bernalillo
county yield.
Madam speaker yes I will yield
to the gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln counties.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady.
By two will with this came up
and committee it pretty quick
and we were kind and state of
some confusion we some of us
for.
And so just to be clear of the
the bill that's before us
survive and read the two oh two
number and just get some
confirmation on that it's point
two two two five two four point
two is that correct Madam
speaker gentleman that is
correct.
Madam speaker and gentle lady I
am I am pleased the because I've
had an opportunity now review it
fully and the and see the
tremendous work that you've done
to this bill can have for
address.
I think every concern that I've
raised with you throughout that
process when it did go to
Judiciary came down we were
still having some amendments
made up stairs and and didn't
get a chance to really talk
about a couple those so I'm
going to talk about anything in
the bill but I am going to point
to to for page two.
line line this.
And this involves
Criminal threat.
And.
My my concern is simply to offer
a suggestion and I do have an
amendment but offers suggestion
that I think we can strengthen
that a little bit by using some
words that were planned by the
United States Supreme Court in
Brandenburg for the Ohio and I
believe your expert has cited
that during several proceedings
in judiciary of the state
government over the course of
last three weeks and what I'm
what I
I'm intending to do is just
strengthen that language a
little bit there's not much but
I I think it tracks with the
language in Brandenburg and it
may
strength in that particular
provision and so madam speaker
and gentle lady I would like to
offer at this time house floor
amendment number one to house
Judiciary Committee substitute
for House Bill sixty years.
And I believe that it has been
passed out and I will read the
two oh two number madam speaker
if you wish.
Yes.
The two oh two number is point
two two two six nine six point
one.
Gentleman to explain the
amendment.
Madam speaker and and the this
particular amendment
just adds a few words.
To page two line nine.
It inserts the words to the
person or persons receiving the
communication.
An imminent.
In those words are inserted
In place of the word and a N.
online nine so the the the the.
That last lines eight and nine
would read.
Place of assembly for a facility
or vehicle of public
transportation and communicating
to the person or persons
receiving the communication ten
AM and the intent to and then it
goes on.
That languages is a.
Is language that is similar to
the Brandenburg case and it's
one thing that I think would fit
leads to make sure that we are
in line with what the Supreme
Court said in connection with
threats and so I offer that
amendment and the.
I hope the gentle lady might
find that to be friendly.
Gentle lady is as a friendly
amendment.
Madam speaker gentleman we are
conferring however
we do not believe.
Just ask a question.
Yes.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman are you seeking to
narrow.
The definition.
I'm not seeking the more what
I'm seeking to do is is ensuring
that the communications.
With stands in a partner in a
constitutional scrutiny that may
occur
in connection with the spring
for reviewing this
Legislation shouldn't pass.
Not intended to narrow it's not
intended to expand its intended
to comply with the supreme
court's decision.
Madam speaker gentleman's
According to my witness.
Brandenburg
that relates to incitement of
violence.
As opposed to.
True threat.
Madam speaker and gentle lady if
it does and it also
required inciting or producing
imminent lawless action.
and so I'm just trying to make
sure that.
If you're being accused of a
threat.
A criminal threat.
You can't just be there driving
by at thirty miles an hour and
say I'm going to get to.
That has to be.
M. imminent situation where they
can actually fulfill that
threatening.
Those are the words with action.
At that particular time and so
that's why the word eminent is
in Brandenburg and that's why I
would suggest we include that
here but it is it's not an
intent to expand or contract
it's an intent to ensure that
this can withstand Fund
constitutional scrutiny.
Madam speaker downtime and the
tenth circuit has not required
imminent.
For true threat.
Madam speaker and gentle lady of
the tenth circuit
has to follow the spring for
approvals and so I think having
the word imminent would probably
help out in this situation but
again if if you if you don't
want to find it friendly that's
fine I'm just trying to suggest
that this would.
Of.
Make it a little more clear that
that's the type of
threats of we're talking about
and that it would withstand
constitutional scrutiny should
this ever go up on appeal to the
there are Supreme Court or the
Supreme Court of the United
States.
Madam speaker gentleman's at
this time my preference would be
that this is an unfriendly
amendment but I think that
there's certainly an opportunity
for further
Researching.
Madam speaker gentle lady
there's probably not time for
that but.
I mean it can be voted down I'm
I'm just raising the issue and
and this is the find of them
firmly I did not ask for a roll
call vote so it's pretty quick
and we debate the vote on the
motion and move on.
I do stand for questions Madam
speaker thank you gentlemen is
there debate on the amendment.
Gentleman from Lee.
Thank you madam speaker does the
gentleman from Eddie and Chavis
and Lincoln you know.
Madam speaker and gentleman I
certainly yield to my next door
neighbor in Lee County.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman can you
If you would please dive a
little bit deeper into why you
feel like the court Casey you're
pulling actually applies in the
state of New Mexico.
Well madam speaker and gentleman
generally where and when there
is a threat.
There are threats made all the
time but they're not actionable.
The threat has to be something
that puts one in you for your
and feels like that person can
actually carry out what they say
they're going to do.
So there's a.
A big difference between the two
of us and you say you're going
to come beat me up.
It's not a real threat because
there's a barrier between us.
So.
In this case we're creating a
crime a crime of criminal
threat.
And just tie it down I felt that
it might be important to reflect
that is not communicating and
intent to do those things but
the it's communicating.
To the person receiving the
communication and eminent
of intent to carry out that
action and that's what the
Brandenburg
Seven and that's what the.
My concern is is that we put
language that has been tested in
the statute so that if the
server goes up on appeal that
meets whatever constitutional
scrutiny would be given to this
to that particular fact
situation.
You madam speaker thank you
gentlemen so.
With that
The state this year a couple
years down the road and then we
do have a situation where this
makes it to.
all the way to our Supreme Court
what would Madam speaker and
gentleman what would happen to
our law.
If the Supreme Court.
Ruled in favor.
Of the the U. S. supreme court's
ruling.
And then the second piece of
that what would happen and what
would be the implications in the
state in New Mexico if our
Supreme Court win against the U.
S. Supreme Court.
Well probably depends a madam
speaker and gentleman probably
depends on on.
How those facts arrived at the
court.
but I would tell you this that
if the facts were such that.
A criminal threats were made on
the school premises against.
A.
Person whose lawfully at the
school premises.
And.
There was not that imminent
There was not the idea of.
The person has the ability to
carry out the.
and yet they were arrested and
convicted for that for a.
I'm sure the defense attorney
would be saying but that threat
was not imminent and I'm sure
one side with side the tenth
circuit case of the gentle lady
mentioned a moment ago and that
would be the
Defense lawyer citing the United
States Supreme Court in
Brandenburg Rigby Ohio probably
it's prodigy that says a that
threat has to be eminent it has
to be capable of being carried
out of them for that to be
actionable so you have the court
having to decide whether to
enforce this law four to allow
that person to be released
because the threat was not
imminent.
Thank you madam chair thank you
gentlemen so.
To to expand upon that point if
the court chose not to agree
with the US Supreme Court then.
If if I understand the process
then the next step would be to
go to
for the for the defense to take
this all the way to
the US Supreme Court is that how
this process works are.
Madam speaker and and gentleman
it it could go that far but
getting to the United States
Supreme Court is
Highly unlikely
you know our Supreme Court
rules and that's probably the
end of it it would be very
unusual to see a court
this United States for record
taking a case such as that of
New Mexico one our court is
ruled unless I just find it so
egregious that they would be
Grumman Sir Sharif to take the
case.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Sir
Representative gentleman so.
Madam chair and gentleman to me
just be in the engineer in the
room trying to look at things
logically it would make sense
that we would ride.
A new piece of legislation that
would be consistent with the U.
S. Supreme Court ruling.
In order Mr speaker and
gentleman in order to reduce
time in court reduce penalties
everything that's associated
with the lawsuit.
We wouldn't have to have this if
if we already have the
definition and more already in
compliance with the U. S.
Supreme Court would that be a
fair statement.
Madam speaker and gentleman I
think it would just make it more
clear and it's consistent with
the Supreme Court decision but
obviously reasonable minds can
can differ on that point.
Sen.
We run in my opinion we run
risks that may be the courts
will differ with that
interpretation were in my mind
is very clear if we use language
that is already been tried and
tested in the highest court in
our nation.
I appreciate that madam chair
and and gentleman I appreciate
you taking the time to the to to
teach no lawyer a little bit
more of a case laws and I stand
in support of your amendment I
think the reason why we should
write laws differ with our US
Supreme Court judgments thank
you madam chair thank you Jonah
you.
There is further debate the
gentleman from Travis Lynn
Roosevelt's.
Thank you madam chair of the
Sure will the gentle lady yield.
gentlemen behind here.
And yes madam speaker and
gentleman all I will yield.
I stand corrected.
Will the gentleman yield.
Matt Madam speaker and gentleman
yes I will yield thank you madam
speaker.
Gentleman
I find myself the.
Pondering
Part of a sentence and wanting
to genuinely in creating the
legislation before us and it is.
For us in on.
Attorneys.
Figure.
Gentleman
eight one confused so I hope we
can
field with this important
amendment in an expeditious way
and perhaps find ourselves back
on the the.
The the meat of the legislation
that we're thinking about this
evening so I look forward to
To an Action gentleman thank
you.
Mr speaker and gentleman thank
you.
Is there for the debate on the
amendment.
General don't see any further
debate the gentleman like
clothes on the amendment.
Mr speaker I think just think
the voice voice vote will go on
as.
Gentleman there with me I tired
as we all are so hang on to
second where and but we are in
adoption of Mr.
I'm sorry gentleman from
Bernalillo thank you Mr go down
from Travis alternative motion
to table.
As a motion to table that takes
president house floor amendment
number one.
To house bill sixty eight.
On house House Judiciary
Committee subsidy.
For on house bill sixty eight
that we're going to say there's
no roll call vote in requests to
will do by bus for boys from all
those in favor of table in the
amendment please say I.
All of those nay.
Okay.
The eyes have it.
The amendment is table gentleman
from Chavis and Lincoln used on
the floor.
Mr speaker that had to be way
too close for comfort for you.
Reserve the ability of it even
though you turn down my
amendment the I do appreciate
the many many amendments that
you have made up my request to.
Focuses of Bill on what I think
was your critical concern and
even though I voted no against
the judiciary I do think that
it's a good piece of legislation
at this point and do you have
brought me around even though
more amendment didn't pass time
over five.
Mr speaker gentle lady thank you
are we are back on the bill
the gentle lady from Bernalillo
Santa Fe and Santa Fe
Representative Lord.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
please yield.
Mr speaker Denton I will yield
to the gentle lady from
Bernalillo son of a Santa Fe and
Santa Fe counties very good
thank you Mr speaker
gentle lady so that when bills
come through here there's some
bills from me that are very easy
us those other bills that are
very strong no and then there's
some that are challenging with
this one so I want to walk
through some stuff because I
don't know if you're aware this
bill became national news it was
all over the place so I want to
make sure that people know that
the changes were made some very
significant changes in the bills
and all of the second amendment
people were very concerned about
this bill so Mister speaker.
And gentle lady.
Sorry.
What.
Quickly.
The speaker is a two good for me
and gentle lady so.
The the first part I think I
said this before.
In committee my biggest issue
with this bill is that there
were six components three were
great and three absolutely hated
and I know you guys of work
through the bill but I need to
make sure that I'm fully
understanding and and the gun
advocate people that are
watching understand the changes
that were made and this and
well.
So.
Madam speaker Representative.
I struggle still with the first
section about criminal threat.
And one of the problems I do
have is.
I kind of wish we would have
gone with eminent danger and the
reason being is based on the
Brownsberger of the Ohio that it
does say eminent I think that
would have made this a little
bit better and tied it up but
that isn't really my heartburn
is.
Madam speaker and gentle lady.
It was really hard because
listen to Representative those
Representative last night.
That made an amazing speech
about first amendment rights.
And as grotesque as the Westboro
Baptist churches I'm gonna call
my by name because those people
are disgusting they're still
have by the Supreme Court they
sell the right to hold up the
most horrific signs of ever seen
in my life and I hated.
But on the same time.
I think about Nicolas Cruz and
that was a school shooter and
Florida madam speaker and gentle
gentle lady.
That kid actually put on social
media for about a year that he
was going to go and shoot up the
school and then I think about
the something about first
amendment rights and I'm
thinking about this kid and I'm
thinking about first amendment
rights and I'm thinking about
this kid.
And it's hard because it becomes
law.
Verses.
A motion.
So it is in the.
The part I struggle with and
maybe you can explain more of a
little bit in depth.
How would this help stop.
Somebody like Nicolas Cruz and
if you're not familiar look at
him as a shooter and and Florida
and and he was one.
Unfortunately slip through the
cracks he went to mental health
nothing was done I mean this kid
I think it was on social media
such me Madam speaker and
Representative assignment the
gentle lady.
He even put a picture of himself
with his guns and he was gonna
go and shoot up the school so
maybe you can explain to me how
this section would have stopped
somebody like Nicholas Cruz but
yet not captured somebody who
said something.
That may have come off as a
threat but really wasn't maybe
can you help me with this
section please.
Then speaker and gentle lady.
Madam speaker and gentle lady so
many other states do have a
provision similar to this and
with respect to your first
question as to whether this
could have helped in the case in
Florida the answer is that
potentially yes.
Thank you
madam speaker and gentle lady I
do agree with you on that
because.
That is something that a wait on
me for such a long time because
when I read that case it's
heartbreaking that kid was
literally screaming from the
rooftops that he was going to go
and shoot up a school and he
fell through every single
correct that there is and and
and it's heart wrenching so.
I understand where you're going
with this and I agree I just
want to make sure that our first
amendment rights are still
reserves and that's always a
challenging thing
So the part that madam speaker
and gentle lady.
The part that made national news
those two parts in here and I
want to make sure that they have
been.
Change on page four.
Online twenty three it looks
like we returned back to Mr more
like it was before so that we
don't have teenagers being
felons anymore is that correct.
Madam speaker gentle lady that
is correct we have reverted to
the current language in statute
Madam speaker and gentle lady
thank you so much for that I
appreciated that was just really
that one was I was really
struggling with that part so I
appreciate that I just wanted to
make sure I've read through this
as I make sure I'm not missing
anything and I think the
previous representative so the
school's own portion has been
removed as well is that correct
Madam speaker gently Madam
speaker gentle lady that is
correct the school's own portion
has been removed.
Thank you Madam speaker and
generally those are the two
questions that made the national
news that got feed people fired
up all over the place I'm really
happy with it so hold on when I
flip the pages because I got a
rustling down at the same time
without my glasses falling down.
Okay Madam speaker and
Gentle lady the next section
section three.
Serious violent felon that is
found to be in possession of a
firearm shall be guilty of
second degree murder.
that part I never had issue with
so that still looks like it
stayed the same Madam speaker
and gentle lady.
I want to talk real briefly
without.
Politicizing this section.
I love this portion on page
eight on over a lot to say that
but Madam speaker and
Representative it hits really
close to my heart after what
just happened yesterday when we
had violent criminals that were
fleeing.
And took that opportunity to
harm a law enforcement officer.
I cherish who I'm very happy to
hear he that he's stable as of
this morning and possibly headed
home but.
I think about him and this
portion and.
I kind of wish Madam speaker and
gentle lady almost wishes bill
would have been split up into
six different parts so we could
have just passed like this this
one would have flown through
there would be no argument so
this is a portion I wish it
would have been pulled out and
made separate because you're
fleeing from law enforcement
after we just saw yesterday
that would have been an
incredibly helpful thing to have
right now.
So.
Liminal belong.
Madam speaker and
Since our Gallo motional effort
just once again madam speaker
and gentle lady so here is my
heartburn still this is the
portion that is a heartburn for
me.
I wish I knew you guys did a lot
of changes and thank you so much
for that I do appreciate all the
hard work they were so many
people that had a lot of
influence on this and and thank
you for that here's my little
bit of heartburn.
Someone section five.
Madam speaker and gentle lady on
section eighteen.
I so wish and I would've been so
much happier with this wording.
Possession and use brandishing.
Of a dangerous weapon.
For discharge of a firearm and
this is why.
I I it's it's a point.
Madam chair representative that
I always bring back around.
That's a point that always bring
back around yesterday it was a
big contention for me whenever
we point out one object.
Should be penalized an inanimate
object should be penalized
because I was go back to if
somebody is raped or murdered or
injured it doesn't matter
whether it's a knife or if it's
a fire arm if it's a baseball
bat it doesn't matter what it is
to me so can you explain to me
and in this very serious
question
Madam speaker and this is going
to be kind of the breaking point
because I love the respite let
other questions bill except I
hate this portion.
Can you explain to me why.
We singled out.
Just.
A firearm.
And not.
Session you Sir brandishing of a
dangerous weapon because of your
bad actor and you're doing bad
things to innocent people
innocent children I don't
understand why we just don't
have.
Dangerous weapon.
Madam speaker gentle lady thank
you for that question.
The reason that this section
relates to firearms is because
as my expert witnesses.
have reminded me firearms are
extremely elevated risk of
danger
and that's because of the
distance and frequency and also
a reduced ability to escape.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady still doesn't
appease being because I think of
Rwanda were six hundred thousand
people were killed in Shetty's
so I know that people can do a
very dangerous thing so my
biggest heartburn in all
honestly if you guys want to
ever make me happy in this life
time which I know doesn't matter
because I'm in the minority if
you change that worsen wanting
to possession use brandishing a
dangerous weapon because
honestly to me it makes no
difference what item you have
you can have a machete could
have a nice to have a straight
razor you can have anything to
harm somebody and I feel that if
you're using a tool and I don't
care what it is then you were a
bad actor that also is using
something to do something more
horrendous than what you
possibly could have done with
your bare hands so.
That is my biggest part but I
struggle with
it does I have a hard time with
that wording and I know it said
that from the very beginning
that my biggest problem was
singling out anytime we single
out a firearm instead of a
baseball bat or instead of you
know a car anything that you
could use to harm somebody to me
it is very problematic but with
that being said madam speaker
and gentle lady I do appreciate
and I thank you for working with
I don't even know how many
people you ended up working with
another was a whole team of
people to remove those two
sections out that we're really
really bad
all sit here and think about
this some more and that's all
the question I have thank you.
Thank you gentle lady there is
further debate the gentleman
from Valencia County
Representative Baca.
Thank you madam speaker with the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
please yield.
Madam speaker I will yield to
the gentleman from Valencia
County.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady from Bernalillo
the questions that I'm gonna be
asking are are really about the
schools in about senator on that
that is my focus as a school
administrator I definitely
understand that so I'm gonna
tell you that I was gonna ask
questions for clarification of
how this is applied based upon
scenario that I've seen.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo I do I do actually
appreciate the fact the word
about the threat to K. because
many times that that it doesn't
just have to be eminent but it
does have to be perceived I know
that a couple years it was a
couple weeks ago right before I
came here to session we have
that national to talk and
because of seeing that but not a
lot of these threats are
actually nationally shared
threats that are sent over
there.
And there are certain schools.
Terms see these threats and
school districts take a number
of different steps to ensure the
safety and current confidence.
Madam speaker gentle lady.
The social media those come in
the US or threats divinity
address or the address in this
act and how do the how does it
fit into this act for a school
district for those that may.
Send out the social media
threats.
Madam speaker gentleman yes
those types of threats are
captured by this provision but
they have to also demonstrate a
serious intent to harm.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlelady from Bernalillo.
When we have I remember a
specifically a threat but a
person wearing a bandanna with
the Z. saying that tomorrow the
schools are going to be shut up
I mean the that.
Type of threats is could be
service
so let me ask this question
Madam speaker gentle lady.
The threat may have originated
someplace out in New York in New
Jersey but if the church from
somebody from my screen that
they get this post and they
share with other students does
is that covered in this in this
act for this bill.
Madam speaker gentleman's it
could be because they're
communicating threats.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady from Bernalillo
I think that's one of the
questions that I really have
because so much of what this is
a good with me Instagram whether
the Snapchat would be one of
these others insured and every
single day that we have this one
of the things that we have is we
have learning loss right when we
have these national threats when
we have these threats are we
have students that are not
coming to school.
We have emails that are being
wasted because they've been
prepared and ready for the day
for.
We have employees are calling in
sick.
So madam speaker and gentle lady
I I really think that that's an
area that we really need to look
at about it because that is that
is a disruption and it is an
impact
on our resources and as far as
people's bug public confidence.
Madam speaker generally I do
have another question for you
okay and this is regarding
athletic events okay.
Madam speaker gentle lady was
actually June APS it was here a
couple within the last month or
two because of a perceived
threat like what is covered in
your bill which I agree with.
The.
This is the game was played
without of fans in attendance.
Golden State for the loss of
revenue or days receipts.
As part of this the loss or
damages.
Madam speaker gentleman only
after the person is found
guilty.
Thank you madam speaker and
thank you gentlelady from
Bernalillo because it could be
tried the impact of management
talking about you know the small
schools in the east coast is
part of the state that may not
be but thank you talking
Cleveland verses of Rio Rancho
high school the potential for
games is huge so I would want to
make sure that those can be
covered under this and that
those kinds of damages could be
awarded if the judge so C.
philosophes.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo.
The other question that I have
is about how do we calculate
wages okay because when we have
these events one of my district
is in the state of one of these
threats.
Times we have other agencies
whether be New Mexico state
police for the building also in
S. PD one to county sheriff's
department of other officers
that have to go to the schools
prefer to burn for help to
secure protect the school sites.
How isn't or do we have
something in there about how we
can calculate that cost for the
use of resources.
For these threats.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
Could you clarify for me if
you're asking about the wages
that would be.
Lost could you.
Thank you Madam speaker thank
you gentle lady from Bernalillo
it is about the wages okay the
wages of the police officers
that respond to the school for
the purposes of protecting the
school those wages how those
wages be calculated if people
brought in for those.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman with regard to how
they are calculated what we have
in this statute matches what is
in the existing bomb scare
statute and so that has already
that's been established.
I
you minister convention I guess
it just for the party that
reserve was reporting that so if
by a school official I am the
you know the person because I
again I do work these entities
I'm thankful for my law
enforcement partners that at any
moments notice I could get on
the phone and they will have
three or four or five officers
there.
What I need to get the
information from the
municipality for the agencies
that how would I report that in
this kind of thing that's kind
of a case.
Madam speaker gentleman's that
information would be reported to
the judge and the judge would
make a decision.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlelady from Bernalillo

do actually I did want to move
the floor amendment number one

Is there debate on the
amendment.
Speaker and I think

think that that requires more.
Madam speaker page nine line
eighteen.
And one line seventeen.
Gentleman would you like to
withdraw this amendment and re
drafted to include thank you
madam speaker that can

I would like to withdraw this
amendment and include a new
language for the other

There is a gentleman.

There there is further debate on
the bill and the gentleman from
Lee County Representative
Pettigrew.
Thank you madam chair does the
gentlelady from Bernalillo you.
Madam speaker I will yield to
the gentleman from Lee County.
Thank you.
First
I think it's is
to.
Speaker to my car that calling
on the other side of the island
of the bill sponsor on this.
Madam speaker gentle lady very
patient you have a
kept true to your word and I
appreciate that through this
whole process.
Madam speaker and
gentle lady I would.
Call your attention to.
Section two line fourteen page
three.
And and and all the way through
line seventeen I want to make
sure speaker and gentle lady
that I understand.
What this does.
Everything in underneath this
does this defines Madam speaker
and gentle lady exceptions to
unlawful possession would that
be correct.
Madam speaker gentleman yes
exceptions.
Thank you so much Madam speaker
and gentle lady if you would be
so kind as to flip over to page
for.
And.
I'm gonna read from page three
as well but this one
one twenty five on page three
engaging in the use of a handgun
looming over to page four lines
one through four target
shooting.
Seven establish range authorized
by the governing body of the
jurisdiction in which the range
is located or in an area.
Or the district of a handgun
without legal justification is
not prohibited by law.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
As you may be aware that in my
neck of the woods we have the
significant amount of pets
aggregate quarries
down in that neck of the woods
and Senator are privately held
several are on state land.
And madam speaker and gentle
lady.
Our use use those pets to.
Practice target.
Practice no just.
To go out and shoot in a very
safe place.
And it is.
In my opinion.
That they need to that would
fall under state that this not
marked or on BLM land that's not
marked.
For private land that is allowed
by the private landowners that.
Speaker gentle lady with that
fall under lines three and four
of that paragraph.
Madam speaker gentleman yes.
Perfect thank you was a concern
of mine
We have a lot of people that
like to do that and I just want
that's the way I read the
language but I wanted to make
sure I understood that.
Speaker and then gentle lady and
forgive me if you've answered
some of this on page eight.
Can we talk about.
The added language from from I
don't I starting on line one
from C. ending on line sixteen
can you tell me the intention of
that being added back in.
Madam speaker and gentleman
you're referring to page eight
lines one through sixteen is
that correct madam chair.
Madam been gentle lady.
Madam speaker and gentleman that
just language goes with the.
For us defining a serious
violent felon and that language
then matches.
It matches subsection C..
Speaker gentle lady I just
realize that out of the.
Fifteen different versions of
this bill that I have this was
actually in the original.
My apologies.
For for the twelve page bill for
my file to be an inch and a half
thick is is crazy
Madam speaker and gentle lady
the.
Last question I have on the
details of the bill.
Would be on page ten.
Starting the line.
Eighteen.
The.
Be increased by five years
except that when the offender is
a serious youthful offender for
youthful offender who's received
an adult sentence.
The sentence imposed by the
subsection may be increased by
three years.
Madam speaker and gently tell
me.
What court.
Would be the one that would
would be hearing that serious
useful offender charge.
Madam speaker gentleman District
Court.
District Court madam speaker and
gentle lady this moves out of
the the CYFD oversight and is
not a judicata through G. what
CYFD is oversight anyway would
that be correct madam speaker
and gentle lady.
Madam speaker gentleman yes.
Excellent news thank you very
much one of my
concerns is that we have
offenders in the judicata with
CYFD oversight and as they come
out of the CYFD system.
Those files are locked in our
dust have no clue what kind of
people are being let into back
into society with with no
knowledge so madam speaker
gentle lady you've cleared my
mind on one two two really big
issues for me and I really
appreciate your time really
appreciate again your patience
and and working with us to to
clean this bill up on a on a
bill that.
Most of us can live with the
least the majority of the bill
if not all of the bill I thank
you very much then figure out
you know but.
Thank you gentlemen there is for
the debate the other gentleman
from Lee County Representative
Scott are you in.
The.
The gentleman from Chavis Lee in
Roosevelt Representative
Anderson.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentle lady yield.
Madam speaker yes I will leave a
yield to the gentleman from
Chavis Lee and Roosevelt.
You are gentle lady I as you
know opposed.
this bill in a previous
committee in the house.
And listening tonight to the
debate has been extremely
helpful
as you know.
Madam speaker gentle lady I'm
not an attorney and so I I tend
to not try to get too bogged
down on.
Those important aspects but.
My question Madam speaker gentle
lady is really one and that is.
Gentle lady when you.
Return home after this session
and you're talking to the.
Community rotary club and
telling them what passed and
what didn't how would you
describe of the bill we're
hearing tonight house bill sixty
eight to that group.
Madam speaker gentleman what I
would say is that this is a bill
that is targeted and.
Targeted in its tougher
sentences.
Thank you very much for that and
that was my understanding this
evening and not my understanding
previously and for that reason I
look forward to supporting your
bill thank you madam chairman
thank you generally.
Thank you gentlemen.
Members the amendment is being
drafted by a Legislative Council
services we've conferred with
the member with the gentleman
and we're going to take a pause
for a moment while that happens
and we're positive clock as
well.
Gentleman we are going to go to
another bill just give us a
second.
R. and everybody this is what's
happening you ready for this.
Okay we're going to go on to
item number four.
On this house bill one of four
as amended
the gentle lady from Santa Fe.
We'll be here momentarily we're
going to start.
that debate with the gentleman
from Bernalillo.
The what we're gonna do for a
minute is let leadership confer
with each other.
Is going to make sure leadership
is comfortable with all that
Swanton you want you guys to
know what's going on.
Alright everyone leadership is
an agreement this is the
gentleman from Bernalillo comes
to the floor we will begin.
Gentleman from Bernalillo.
Representative this is are you
ready on item for.
Madam speaker given that point
please.
But the record reflect that all
action necessary for placing
House Bill one of four as
amended on final passage has
been taken and that it is now
subject to debate amendment for
substitution gentleman to
explain the bill.
Thank you madam speaker
honorable members this is
hospital one hundred four
relating to public finances and
acting the venture capital
program act providing for
investments in certain Mexico
businesses and private equity
funds without all stand for
questions.
There is debate on the bill the
gentleman from some of
Representative Harper thank you
madam speaker does the gentleman
from Bernalillo yield I miss
yes.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo.
it looks like you are one of
several sponsors of this bill.
I did not see this in committee
and I have a.
Have for questions Mr Chairman
we've seen several.
Bills that half the goal is to
increase economic development in
the state by having the state to
invest.
taxpayer dollars in in different
businesses.
then it looks like we're doing
this again here some I have
learned how this is different.
the speaker and gentleman could
you maybe just start with where
this fund.
is managed from and how the
management structure set up to
we have a a new fund we have a
board those kinds of things and
I Mr Chairman thank you madam
speaker gentle from Santa you're
correct this is a new material.
As you know was endorsed by the
legislative finance committee
over the interim the authority
in the bill means the New Mexico
finance authority so the New
Mexico finance authority
you know so there's definitions
for New Mexico business venture
private equity fund and so the
fund is created within the New
Mexico finance authority thorny
shall adopt rules governing the
terms and conditions.
And making investments pursuant
to this act the authority shall
make investments in venture
private equity funds or.
The state investments in New
Mexico businesses whose
investments or enterprises
enhance the economic development
objectives of the state has
determined by the economic
development department statewide
economic development strategy
plan.
Speaker Jennifer Lee thank you
for that answer so another New
Mexico finance authority
administered.
Fund and Mister John and it's
unlike the bill last evening or
earlier today.
we don't I'm guessing from your
answer there is not a new board
that it would still be the the
existing board of the New Mexico
finance authority that would Mr
this.
Speaker gentle from Santa that's
correct the we're not putting
any new powers that be but the
but the finance authority which
currently exists and does good
work.
Mr leader gentleman
Madam speaker and gentleman I I
agree with you they do great
work and you happen to know
gentleman from Bernalillo the
make up of that board again I
think there's Senator.
Political appointees slash
Senator secretaries but do you
recall your call on the make up
of that board thank you thank
you madam speaker gentleman's
son of August I should know this
but I believe it's the state
treasurer.
I have a list of ten governor
governor and then appointees by
the governor the Senate and the
house but I I'm not a hundred
percent sure but
that's about eighty eight or
ninety six correct.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo thank you and do we
have a member from DFA on the
board you know.
From Santa Fe I.
I don't know what the secretary
for statute is a member of.
Of the.
Of the finance authority
But I was given the governor.
The point the debt the secretary
and and I'm I'm sure within
consultation there of makes
decisions but but I honestly
don't know.
One moment.
Thank you madam speaker John
from Santa so thank you from the
prime sponsor Representative
Dixon but the secretary of
economic development.
Secretary of the environment.
Department secretary of energy
and correct secretary of a
department of finance
administration as a seat on that
board.
Madam speaker and Jennifer early
and and gentle lady thank you
for for that help I I appreciate
that very much administered
forgive me master John from
Santa I was my brain was
thinking just I see so so I was
incorrect.
Thank you.
Transfigured General Assembly
for that clarification also
thank you gentle lady.
so.
I guess again just a little bit
of.
you know perhaps a little bit of
caution a little bit of red flag
coming up in my mind we're
talking about making
investments.
and you know having a group of
folks that you know I'm sure
they're appointed to be
secretaries because there are
qualified in their respective
area of expertise but again
these are political appointments
and so
what I do just have a little
concern as opposed to
Another have a.
so the taxpayer that was passed
last year where we have factual
technical experts evaluate
proposals for folks wanting to
get the G. R. T.
exemption for some work to be
done at a national lab folks of
Ortiz paid in license technology
I worry that this there's a
there's gonna be some some
politics to this
massacre and gentleman and I'd
love to have you can hear your
thoughts on that.
Thank you for your call I was
actually.
Conferring with the the primary
sponsor would you mind stating
that question again
just for your enjoyment from
early yes no no no no worries at
all I'm I'm just a little
concerned that
clearly even if it's unintended
there's going to be politics
involved in the decision making
process as opposed to another
structure that we had set up
which was pretty technical and
so Mr Chairman we you and I are
familiar with you know previous
as I see issues were decisions
were political and look in our
face so what are you what your
thoughts on the potential for
that happening here and are
there any safeguards.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
from some of our it's a great
concern always I I think.
Concerns I had with similar.
Agencies in the past I don't I
don't have them here for certain
guardrails in place for example
business or industry cannot
exceed ten percent of the of the
fund.
and then of the investments
represent no more than fifty one
percent of the total investment
of that business so there's
it's kind of guidelines there
And I think there's I think it's
such a broad array of leadership
on that on that board including
public citizens that.
That I don't think one person
can can make those arbitrary
decisions like what you
mentioned earlier.
I am sure gentleman from
Bernalillo thank you for that.
that that does give me a little
comfort to know that there are
perhaps some safeguards.
in place so that this is less
likely to happen so we don't we
won't repeat
You know we we've learned these
lessons we don't need repairs in
the past so Mister Jones thank
you for that so this is a new
fund speaker and gentleman and
and I don't see an appropriation
in this bill was there
appropriation in the budget or
another bill and how much are we
sitting this fund with.
Thank you minister General Fund
Santa and madam speaker if I may
yield to offer Santa to the
delayed from Santa Fe who for
the primary sponsor as well and
she'll carry out the remainder
of the debate.
Thank you John from Bernalillo
and thank you a gentleman on as
well for the question thank you
madam speaker on the you were
just asking are you trying to
get oriented you were just
asking about the the funding for
it was included in house bill
two and as we know there still
some conversations right now
madam speaker and gentleman
about the final number that will
be determined in their.
Madam speaker and generally from
Santa Fe sake you for the answer
and I'd like to thank the
gentleman from Bernalillo for
his time I always enjoyed
debating with him on the floor
so so there is some money do you
recall what how much was in this
fun when it left the house.
Thank you gentlemen and thank
you madam speaker I believe
originally was one hundred fifty
million dollars originally it
was a hundred and five million
dollars I'm apologies switching
numbers.
The minister gentlelady yeah I
think the
the legislative finance
committee was recommending up to
a hundred and five million
dollars but I think the
The actual house passed version
of house bill two included fifty
million dollars so so roughly
half of that aspen still a
healthy start
so.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
Is this is set up like many of
the other funds
in
The NMFA who were it's
essentially a revolving loan
fund.
I'm sorry madam speaker John
what can you repeat the question
I don't fully understand what
you mean by that yes amounts
bigger gentle lady I'm I'm
asking how is this fund actually
structured is it gonna be like
requests are or these gonna be
loans that are repaid and then
the repayment of those loans are
given used to seed other loans
that we that's how I usually am
NMFA funds work but I just would
like to know how this one does
thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen for the question
and I appreciate the
clarification yes it would be
like the letter as your more
similar I should say to the
latter on these are venture
capital invested funds which as
a lot of folks in the investment
community called it's it's this
point in which growth hasn't
completely slowed but it's not a
start you know sort of started
with it's very very risky
there's still some good movement
in there and then there's a
return that the business that
that the state would get off
from those investments as well
and so that would be put back
into the fund madam speaker
gentleman's so that you know can
continue to be invested in for
their stuff in in future
businesses.
madam speaker and gently from
Santa Fe thank you for your your
answer and see the gentleman
from.
Chavis just shared with me
where this funds financing is
right now at least as a left
Senate finance it looks like it
is now thirty five million
dollars.
So looks like they had to a
give that one a little bit of a
hair cut so thank you gentlemen
for for sharing that information
with me and Mr Lee thank you for
your answer to that question and
it kind of leads me to this is a
follow on to that so now we know
how to fund kind of works
Mr Julie from Santa Fe
Do you do you cubes maybe to
share to the body so that we're
all kind of familiar with I mean
venture capital funding.
Is is kind of a different
animals and a lot of other
things.
how works what stage of the
development of a particular
product it comes into play can
you it is maybe sure with
the body
just kind of the the one one
basics of inter capital funding
thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen that's a wonderful
question so are there are when
it when there's a new business
idea that the golf begins on
there's usually multiple rounds
of funding and so often times we
getting one is what's called the
friends and family fun madam
speaker and gentleman where you
do get funding from your friends
funds pretty self explanatory
and then when the United talked
about the faster the equipment
angel investment which comes in
very early it is a bit riskier
because it's so early there's
kind of funding new ideas and
you know many people would ask
about the on the pay off on a
lot of those and then often
times venture funding comes and
and what's unique about venture
funding is that venture Fuji
inter capitalised on are often
part of an institution other
business higher education of you
know groups have a venture
capital the groups you know
states to many other larger
institutions have these and
that's when they start to really
investing the it is not just
about ideal personality it's
when things are really starting
to come to market but it's very
early on still and so that's
unique point the venture is in
on it for the madam speaker and
gentleman he's also point which
it's helping products get to
market and that's sourcing for a
lot of our our our young
businesses is the need that
point so we can keep them here
and encourage them to grow but
they have that initial funding
when they're really getting off
the ground moving for the
growth.
Mr Julie for Santa Fe thank you
that I I think those are the
great one on one kind of level
description of venture capital
funding and and then speaker and
gentle lady we've talked a
little bit about this valley of
death so that the venture
capital funding really helps you
cross.
And really this value value of
destiny I just was really just.
Simply to summarize it's.
It's actually not so challenging
to develop a proto type of
something new
I mean I'm I'm not trying to
understate it it's it's a lot of
work right I mean I have I
patterns I know however I know
how this challenging it is but.
actually getting a something
that works that demonstrates
what you are are trying to do is
is not that challenging the
prom is generally it takes a
Ph.D to run it and you want to
turn it into a robust product
that
it was not challenging to to
teach folks to use.
And crossing that bridge is is
super challenging that value of
deaths we talk is.
Really about nine out of ten
drugs die in that valley because
it it just it is so hard I
manufacturing is hard.
as we generally
one of my inventions that I'm
very proud of we had a small
team that worked I was a little
anthrax credit card sized
anthrax detector that has been
used in Afghanistan it's you
know actually going out for
another department state mission
out Afghanistan we're live
develop approved pro type of
proof of concept within one year
which shocked everyone but it
took us about four years to get
to a point where is actually a
viable product.
So Mister gentle lady
I I understand that we have a
challenge what what you
mentioned in the state of New
Mexico when it comes to having
a lot of venture capital flowing
into our state could you maybe
just talk about that challenge
because I think you're
legislation is trying to address
that challenge thank you madam
speaker thank you gentlemen for
that question yes in New Mexico
we have had a more many
wonderful efforts to really
inspire that early round funding
but what we've heard time and
again from on on for new year's
I've heard from businesses in my
own community that that valley
of death is really where you see
a lot of businesses get lost and
what there's two things that can
happen either the business hold
under because they don't have
that that that opportunity of
growth that they really need
four they get poached out of
state because the venture
capitalists that do exist still
exist here and they're able to
do this and others area.
Yeah Mentzer generally from
Santa Fe thank you that that's
exactly my understanding as well
that
we don't have a lot of folks
here in the venture capital
business and that equates to not
as much venture capital dollars
and when there is a really great
product you'll see.
Folks from Silicon Valley or
elsewhere who you know are you
know well trained and and can
spot these things those who've
been funded and then you know
six months later that business
is no longer in New Mexico and
then as we gradually from Santa
Fe I've seen at but twice from
businesses that spun out
technologies from Sandia labs
you know just in the the you
know that this this short
seventeen years that I've worked
there so that so this is a real
problem speaker and gentle lady
hi I.
And I like that we're trying to
find a solution here but I guess
my concern is and and I love to
hear your thoughts on this.
Government is good at several
things.
speaker and gentle lady from
Santa Fe I mean we're good at
funding roads were were were
generally at least
experienced in doing you know
education.
The
NMFA is really good at the
projects that they run so
perhaps you know perhaps they'll
be good here but.
Venture capital is something
that really the state does not
have experience doing this is a
new saying it right.
And this is a really challenging
thing
master gentlelady.
So
I have two concerns one is that
You know where we to provide
people with the right expertise
to do this
so that we're not losing these
funds I measure cap was lose
money all the time right and
maybe I'll start with that
question and I'll go to my
second but you know one out of
ten investments from venture
capital not just one of ten
projects but when a ten
investments that they deem worth
investing in those are the ones
that succeed the other line
fail.
so are are we expecting a
similar or even.
What what kind of track record
with you know the message really
I think I understand my question
thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen I I appreciate
that question at a if I can
quibble with you I've heard two
out of ten but.
But I do understand your concern
and remains the.
and I hope this also answer your
second question too so in
particular what's unique about
what we have here is that this
allows the NMFA to invest in
businesses do it under capital
but it also empowers them to
work with the venture private
equity funds on that that have
experience that have twelve and
investors on the have experience
in this field and it does lay
out you know encouragement how
that works the still have to
invest in New Mexico businesses
that for the mark on but that is
a big piece of it on another
element I want to mention is
that in New Mexico we do have
the state investment council
however there we have very
strict rules on you know who can
be investor and well I often
times you know rules can be very
helpful what I've heard from
many investors is that even with
their twenty plus years of
investing you know in in large
markets they do not been hit
those qualifications and so we
do have a number of the folks
that we would be able to assist
in that process as well and the
last thing I do just wanna touch
on really briefly is the point
you're making about tech
transfer we do have wonderful
ideas coming out of the labs and
I knew at the federal level we
see senator Ben Ray Lujan really
work on tech transfers as a
means to increase business is
here and I really see this is
supplementing the efforts
thanks for the heads
measurements as well.
Especially for Santa Fe I'm
really glad you you at that the
because
I really feel and I've you know
not made this a secret that when
it comes to economic growth in
the state I feel very strongly
that we should not be using the
tax code to incentivize bringing
big businesses to the state.
that that's not that's not a
wise use of our dollars it's a
government picking winners and
losers and and giving away the
farm for someone who.
Almost by very definition can be
bought.
And and so we don't have a heart
in New Mexico right and will a
state when someone comes with a
better deal and message early I
have an example of this exact
same story in my own district
amount to garden around show
where we gave a sweet deal to a
company and when that sweet deal
expired they up and left in
which to the next we deal so
masterly I I just want to say I
think.
We should be doing is focused on
what we have here.
And do what's called value added
economic developments in the I
think already during the session
that you know we have an
incredible agricultural industry
you know lots of
Derry's and so it makes sense
then that we would have the
largest cheese factory in the US
here right because that's a
value added it's what we have
here and we're adding value to
it as a message urgently I love
how you brought up the labs and
tech transfer because this is
something we have here and and
the federal government best
billions of dollars every year
in these in these laboratories
and and again we can make a nice
prototype of something new that
potentially could change the
commercial market but how do you
then spend that how tech
transferring across the valley
of death so Mister usually I'm I
really appreciate that you added
that thank you of right now and
I appreciate the answer you have
made my first question that you
know we're hoping that.
we'll have you know experts that
are willing to work with this
thirty five million dollars or
making the best investments we
can the Mr gently I mean this is
a really risky business there
are a lot of injectable was out
there because.
honestly most of their funding
is lost right
when they have was provided in
the two out of ten that you
mentioned provided to us had
you know what they hope is that
the money that they lose on the
other eight is overcome by you
know it's really hitting a
winner on one or two.
The Mr gently I just worry that
we even with the best intentions
will probably not have that high
of a track record here with this
program
And that will end up just losing
a lot of.
Dollars that could have either
been invested in a permanent
fund where we had a nice six
point seven five percent return
and then that comes back and we
can fund our K. twelve schools.
in or something to that effect
some spiritually so you can you
can you talk just a little bit
about the risk I mean obviously
you're during this because using
the risk is worth it but
speedily can you just share with
me your thoughts wise sync
losing eighty percent of this
thirty five million dollars is
is worth it.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen I think that's an
excellent question one thing I
want to want to mention about
what we've got in here is that
that is required that the that
the that the NMFA reports back
to LFC and the the tax interim
committee on about how their
performance is going so I think
that will allow us to really
evaluate how the how it's
performing and given that kind
of feedback that you're
concerned about I'd also like to
mention that you know especially
with these types of funds that
typically it's around return of
a twenty five percent to thirty
five percent annually over a
lifetime of a successful
business so the return is
actually would you hit it you
hit it very well and that's kind
of what's expected their arms I
I do think that's important and
the last thing I'll say is that
the measurement of success for
this program is different than
how a lot of other programs
images excess so for example
with the S. I see on when you're
looking at this year they're
looking at pure dollars respect
returns for as we're looking at
a larger
pool of what it was impacted the
economic development the
community the jobs that were
created in that community we're
looking at a more fully rounded
houses impacting local New
Mexico communities and I think
we're going to see that the
returns are much higher than you
would with thank you know with
wallstreet broker would consider
you know because seeing the
development of a community based
health means a lot to us as
legislators for our families and
and you know to the future.
They are most urgently from
Santa Fe thank you and and I
think that's a great answer
I I don't necessarily agree with
that one hundred percent but I
think it's a great answer and I
must be really from Santa Fe
over the last ten years and I've
been here we have made some
earmarks to some of our
permanent fund investments so
yes I see we've talked about
that a little bit today and how
there's a lot of rules on those
and and perhaps maybe that's why
you're bringing this legislation
forward but Mr gently.
the legislature made the
decision that it was worse
perhaps taking not as great the
a return on those dollars if it
meant that we could perhaps
spur some economic development
in New Mexico.
and so I mean this body has
decided that that's worth it
sometimes and so Mister Lee I
think your answer was consistent
with that we are that you're
basically saying perhaps the the
the value opportunity cost
that's lost.
The speaker in New and generally
is worth it if we're able to
help some communities
see some economic development
and if you know one of ten or to
attend a really successful you
know than we we say this was a
force that.
Mr jelly and I also really
appreciate the reporting
requirement so that will be able
to look at this
the programs evolves as it you
know grows and be able to ask
ourselves okay is this thirty
five million that we we just
diverted from you know several
other competing priorities did
we was it worth it we have one
business that really hit it and
that was by greater for an
awesome SB Julie I I appreciate
your answer I'd I'd I'd.
The I guess the.
The the last set of questions I
have.
Our with regards to the rules of
this particular funds or Mr
really we talked about this I
see having lots of rules that
made it challenging.
This fund has some rules
associated with that too rights
are certain businesses that.
Secretary of business must meet
before they're able to apply can
you talk about those criteria
please thank you madam speaker
the gentleman and please let me
know if there's any that I I'm
not going to touch on one thing
I did want to mention is that we
did have an amendment I believe
it was in probation where we
address this is to say that it
would not be limited to the
priorities of economic
development does that department
part of that reason is that
we're seeing growth especially
in southern New Mexico in the
gaming industry we're video game
development is really growing
and you know in talking to
Darius on for new orders in
cosmetics in in a
medical devices in restaurants
support you know various things
like that those are not
necessarily the priorities you
know listed in the strategic
plan of the economic development
apartment and the secretary
agreed that you know doing that
would not a pretender so that
does help with the funding that
we're looking at in the
investment is limited I do wanna
mention all and I think this is
the part you're going to but I
can I can if I'm wrong let me
now.
But they cannot exceed ten
percent of the balance of the
venture capital the venture
capital fund itself the program
and so again that'll make sure
that the money is being
distributed and that the
investment doesn't represent
more than fifty one percent of
of the business however should
the business go under something
like that then we can take that
we can take ownership of fifty
one plus because maybe you know
how the message was does that
answer but you're looking for
something else Mr generally yes
that that that's a great answer
I think there's a little bit
more detail all talk about here
but yes I I appreciate you know
the fifty one percent not group
not equal to or greater than you
know these kinds of criteria
Mr Julie that was one of the I
think a big lessons learned from
the big fiasco we had a awhile
ago with the S. I see was that
one of the rules they adopted
was that other people have to be
investing in this business
before they would and and I
think that's wise because it
shows that those who do this for
a living see value in this and
it's not just to we we see
something that we think is great
but perhaps you don't have the
experience or perhaps we could
be accused of funding a friend
picking you know government
picking winners right so so I do
appreciate that SB usually the
finest others also some criteria
here
for for for example that they
need to adopt green practices.
and.
And there's sensitivity training
for the staff and diversity of
ownership in these kinds of
things can you can you talk
about kind of those criteria
that are in this legislation.
Madam speaker gentleman what
page are using that on the
amendment.
Mr gentility I am looking at one
of our analyses I do not know
exactly which page that is on.
Thank you madam speaker the
gentleman I I don't believe
that's including the bill
however that might be taken from
the original intent of being
included in the strategic plan
by removing that element I think
that those are no longer
concerned staff so that's
usually here
Thank you for that has this.
You mentioned that there was an
amendment to this bill in
appropriations to expand the
projects that I was
able to fund whether any other
changes from the original
legislation.
has introduced.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you Dylan as I had the assist on
on the computer know that there
was no others in that and if you
want to see it's just on page
four well I guess it's a little
different but it's on section a
two we just remove the words as
determined by the economic
development department statewide
economic development strategic
plan it's about removing that
that enabled us to open it up to
the tax businesses that would be
eligible okay madam speaker and
gentle lady I I appreciate that
I.
And I my apologies for not
having the the exact page number
and line in the bill but it does
say here that
further criteria is you know the
businesses that don't adopt
green practices don't subject
staff to sensitivity training
don't have over starship don't
pay what the state considers a
high wage.
And our convenient for public
transit will still be
sufficiently rural.
Might not be in the running for
investment.
Speaker gentle lady thank you SO
familiar I think that is because
they give them and I I don't
believe so I think they might
have taken it from that trump I
I will however say is you know
you know on the rules will be
put for from NFA and NMFA and we
will be able to review those and
make sure that they're
withstanding or or not with
setting that they are you know
achieving the objectives here
which is really getting
investment in New Mexico
communities and developing
businesses that we have here.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
gentle lady I appreciate that
and then I think just to.
To summarize I'm I feel like I
understand a lot better what
this fund is doing and how it's
administered and how it operates
and and I do agree with the the
the problem that you're trying
to solve the lack of interest
have it'll funding here.
I guess my my my biggest concern
minister gentlelady we we've
talked a bit about it is.
That has the folks that will be
happy to empower to to make
these decisions perhaps are not
the most
experienced in the particular
venture capital area.
And also just by the very nature
of the of the make up of the
board our political.
Mr gently and so I I am
concerned that you know as much
as they try to be objective like
we all try to be objective but
we still see the world through
our lenses
that there could be the
potential of
and repeating some of our
partner our past sins of
investing in
not would perhaps be numbers and
cents looks like the best
investment but what maybe
according to our ideology for
those friendships that we have
for those relationships we have
the we might see a greater.
Investment in those types of
projects because we don't have
enough money to fund them all
right we're gonna be selective
spiritually do you have a any
thought on that thank you madam
speaker the gentleman for other
question you know I I I will go
back to do that they are able to
work closely with you know
venture bad equity funds private
equity funds on and speaking
with the Marquita Russel who is
the CEO of NMFA
the start of the head of C. at
FE she was very clear that you
know relying on those experts
was gonna be a big piece for her
and one thing I do want to
mention that traditionally when
you're looking at venture
capital you know the typically
look at specific industry on
that they they want to sell you
can put into the same investor
or the same region but they will
look at how this this is shaping
and so that over time I think
will give and lean towards more
experience and more
beneficial investments.
as we are generally Center thank
you IBM I hope you're right and
and even I mean earlier on it
was mentioned that one of the
safeguards is that you know only
ten percent of these investments
can be made in any one industry.
Mr dele um I I'm not sure if
that's exactly a safeguard I
mean it it might lead to a
broader diversification which is
great in a stock market
portfolio but
again when you're looking at
kind of value added economic
development
that might be something that we
actually want to come back and
revisit because maybe we find
that you know there's three or
four sectors that are just
really hot and doing well and we
would like to focus on those
areas and maybe go up to twenty
or twenty five percent
I still think that if someone
who is
you know perhaps a friend or a
there's a relationship or
something like that if they come
with a different industries as
long as it's not greater than
ten percent that protection
doesn't stop someone from
funding that industry right
Senator generally but.
I.
I guess if you have any parting
thoughts I'm I'm still uncertain
if I'm gonna support this I mean
some of the other ones were a
definite no this one I'm I'm I'm
on the fence on the.
as we usually just understand
the problem and and I think
you've done the best to
structure this in a in a in a
way that would have to be
successful I'm just looking at
the opportunity costs loss
pregnancy gentlelady
you know could we have have
raised teachers salaries by an
extra percent.
You know there are the kind of
thoughts that they go in my mind
And some speaker gently any any
parting thoughts if you're going
to convince me to press the
button.
Thank you madam figured thank
you gentlemen no I ate all I say
that again like a to my my co
sponsor who really was driving a
lot of ways but you know really
look at we want to make sure
that we're growing The New
Mexico economies so that we can
we're not just fixing the
potholes we have now but they
were really investing in it than
a more steady stronger future on
and diversifying the economy we
have.
Speaker gently from Santa Fe
thank you I really appreciate
this this cordial and
informative debate
thank you madam speaker.
Thank you gentlemen are there is
more debate the gentleman from
excuse me the gentle lady from
Travis county Representative
Ezzell.
Madam speaker thank you very
much for the gentle lady yield I
yield to the gentle lady from
Travis Madam speaker thank you
very much of I've been reading
this bill and.
Basically this bill what you're
trying to do here is help those
certain people that have no
credit rating zero credit rating
is that right to get a hold in
the start up thank you madam
speaker thank you gentlemen of
the gentleman on that's a great
question you know it's
interesting that a lot of it the
entrepreneur is deeply invested
mostly with their credit card in
these early stages and so what
this is is once the idea started
to take hold it and helping it
grow and really take hold in the
market and giving them the
opportunity.
Madam speaker if they have that
lower the credit rating they
won't have a credit card is that
correct madam speaker and gentle
lady.
Madam speaker gentle gentle lady
it's it's not really about their
credit that we're trying to
assist it's ensuring that
they're trying their their
business able to get to the next
stage.
Madam speaker it seems like it
they're coming to offer these.
Loans that they've already
exhausted all their ability to
get a loan acquired through the.
Any other lending institution
that's out there and that's the
way I perceive that Madam
speaker gentle lady I am also
glad that the part about the
economic development part of
that was stricken because folks
if you will of paid attention
that I have read this
is there are their goal and it's
very scary to me of.
Some of them include the.
And and I'm not against of
trying to help those that are
socially and economically
disadvantaged.
But promoting climate change
mitigation system the system
toward supporting sustainable
agriculture developing renewable
energy in relying on all turn to
for it the transit system and I
would like to sit down with
somebody from the economic
development department and have
them explain what they're trying
to do here because I've got
concerns over this and that's
Madam chair of the Legislative
that's not casting in the
dispersions against you I just
want some questions from the
economic development department
regarding this
one of the question one of the
problems I have with this bill.
Excuse me.
Never there because government
involvement.
Intuniv the sectors as far as
money lending and everything
they also distort the private
and this meant decisions will
miss madam chair and gentle lady
do you agree with that
statement.
Thank you madam speaker there
think and gentle lady I think
it's important to kind of talk
through the stages of investment
that happen so initially it's
it's again this practice this
friend and family investment
period where you get people to
invest in a company because they
like you I'm sorry.
Madam speaker gentle lady can
you talk a little bit slower
it's kinda distorting and these
math mess that we're having to
wear don't wholesaler just a
little bit slower please madam
speaker thank you the lady I I
think that's a great note I read
here and I didn't stop.
All in but yes so early on
there's a lot of you know self
investment friends and family
investment and that's considered
the first stage and then you get
what's often called the angel
investment manager people that
just believe in your idea and
it's just an idea at that point
and that's a very risky and then
at this point it's with
advocates this is the venture
stage and so what's different
about this is that this is
showing and a lot of
institutions have venture
capital programs higher
education groups businesses all
of all kinds and state
governments and so on and get
like as a private businesses and
so this shows that this is part
of that investment what we did
remove from the bill in our HFC
amendment was the economic
development it was the
requirement that fits in the
economic development strategic
plan and so that allows us to
really reach out to different
industries that may be growing
that are outside of that so I
think on some of the concerns
and that you bring up about the
environment or or you know other
issues that may come up that
you'd mentioned wouldn't apply
in in the newer version of this
bill.
Thank you for that explanation
there and thank you for.
Allowing me to be able to hear
better I appreciate that of
Madam speaker gentle lady are do
you read any.
Qualms that the state investment
council may have regarding the
capital investment.
C. forty recovery program at
thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady you know I know
that some of their concerns that
they had was that they already
have a private equity harm and
what I would say to that is is
well the private equity arm of
the of theirs on it does invest
in New Mexico businesses the the
goals are different because for
us for this one and it it says
it pretty out right that we want
to see job growth we want to see
economic development our
communities this is this program
isn't just measured by how many
dollars it returns but how many
dollars it creates in our
communities.
Well madam speaker just like any
other business fund over there
first get started there is
always at risk of.
Failure and.
I don't want anybody that wants
to get out there is.
The go get him enough to do to
try to starting a business to
get up and running that's not
where I'm going with this so one
every businesses of interest to
be able to succeed in whatever
they go for that Madam chairman
of through NMFA of yeah I NMFA.
There are some things that are
available already
there's local.
Economic centers that do want to
help the person whatever their
first starting at be able to do
those things but I do have a
problem with the dollars that
are coming from the tax payers
monies that are paid into the
state and that risk of failure
is ever present in my mind when
whenever we go home and say okay
we have allocated this much
money to this particular program
Madam speaker and gentle lady do
you know what the Senate has
done in regards to the funding
for your capital.
Of venture capital program at.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady I believe with
this assistance of the minority
or the the independent for chair
that it was thirty five million
dollars that it's at at this
point.
Okay all right so that that has
been of these.
Some of the funding then it
sounds like if memory serves me
right some of that funding has
been cut is that correct madam
miss madam speaker gentle lady.
I'm sorry could you repeat the
question gentle lady.
Okay Representative Anderson.
There was a question in the
process and madam speaker gentle
lady my question was so if it's
now thirty five million I'm
trying to roll the numbers back
of my head on what we did in
appropriations so fifteen.
Casting but with the.
That's about twelve fifteen
million dollars has been cut
from your program then is that
correct thank you madam speaker
thank you gentle lady yes that's
correct okay well madam speaker
I'm still a still have some
qualms with this because like I
said it's taxpayers dollars that
are at risk right here and with
that I can't.
I cannot go back to my
particular district and say Hey
we're spending your tax dollars
to help somebody out that has.
Used up ever ever means of
conventional financing and they
can't get it done that now
you're going to fund their
projects so madam speaker and
gentle lady thank you very much
for your responses to this thank
you ladies.
Thank you generally there there
is debate the gentleman from
Travis Lee and Roosevelt.
Leader.
Anderson.
Thank you madam speaker
Madam speaker will the gentle
the lady yield.
Thank you madam speaker I yield
to the gentleman from Travis Lee
and Roosevelt.
Thank you gentle lady this
morning I had the opportunity to
be in the Senate finance
committee when they were
considering their final version
of house bill two which will be
coming back soon although final
action Madam speaker gentle lady
was not taken the schedule that
I was able to share with you and
others
does show that the intention is
for thirty five million dollars
of funding.
To be the the funds additional
stark Madam
speaker and gentle lady.
Brings this bill this year to
this.
Session of the legislature thank
you gentlemen and thank you
madam speaker it is an LFC bill.
Thank you for that
gentle lady I too had the chance
to have a preview on this bill
in the legislative finance
committee
some time ago and it was.
seems to me gentle lady that.
Madam speaker.
I'm gonna be shortened to the
point.
This state three decades ago
give or take had a young man in
a garage and some more and
Bernalillo county and he was
working on an idea.
And that then left New Mexico
and build Microsoft in another
state and I only point that out
that Madam chair capital.
Use important.
To the young entrepreneurs that
we are trying to attract.
Is this and and all of course
not.
But it is another start.
to do that is there anything
Madam speaker gentle lady that
I've said that.
Because as you in the have I
said it correctly thank you
madam speaker thank you John and
I think you said it beautifully
thank you I think one of the
ideas that.
I haven't heard quite expressed.
Madam speaker gentle lady a
number of.
Is.
The intention of this fund is to
consider.
Participating in other venture
capital funds.
And I think that that is.
Madam speaker gentle lady an
important concept because we
talk about the need for
expertise of.
The knowledge of this type of
financing attracting the
opportunities in the door to
look at and review and consider
and weigh and you have school
risk is one of the important
components that has to be
weighed.
But I have I I do see Madam
speaker gentle lady in the paper
in the ordinary course of the
Albuquerque journal business
section mention of funds that
are participating actively in
New Mexico
technology businesses largely
technology driven in part by our
national labs in the research
being done there.
So I
I think this is a bold step.
But it's not the first amendment
the state has looked at other
ways to participate in my mind
and venture capital.
And they have been cautious and
careful and I believe this may
be another cautious and careful
next step with thirty five
million dollars going into a
fund.
That I believe will be.
Used in other private.
Fund efforts to fund New Mexico
venture capital start ups.
And in a perfect world have them
stay here and not moved to
Seattle Water at Washington and
become a corporate giant so.
Madam speaker gentle lady.
I hope I didn't go to log thank
you for bringing the bill thank
you.
Thank you gentlemen gentleman
from curry Representative
Crowder thank you madam speaker
will gentlelady from Santa Fe
police yield ideal this movie is
a great yield to the gentleman
from curry thank you Julia all I
have to the to the quick
questions on page one of a line
twenty three under section be it
talks about corporation or
limited liability companies and
at the top of page two under the
definition of New Mexico
businesses it talks about
limited partnerships.
But I I I wonder why we don't
see sole proprietors in there is
is the investment into a sole
proprietorship not eligible
under this program thank you
madam speaker thank you
gentlemen I I believe that the
reason why it focuses on those
ones is because of the stage
that these businesses are at
that they should be beyond a
sole proprietor and into a
larger into into a corporation
or LLC at that point.
master jelly I appreciate that I
you know I was very small
business but I because I became
a corporation I was a of
of.
There's two different kinds of
corporations and I was each one
at one time in my career but I I
just wondered why didn't see
sole proprietor in your list
there are some very very
successful businesses that are
actually sole proprietorships
so.
my only other question Madam
speaker and gentle lady is on
page four.
Line twenty it talks about
investment in anyone business or
industry does not exceed ten
percent and I'm curious how you
arrived at the number ten
percent the reason I'm curious
is one of our analysis says that
in twenty eighteen to twenty
five percent of venture capital
investments nationally we're in
the software sector.
And and if there's that much
investment of the software one
time where we limiting this fund
to only ten percent Madam
speaker gentle lady thank.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen this is actually
per investment so that's why
that the individual investments
can be made for more than that.
Okay so can you make multiple
investments into.
One company or or can you
exceeded ten percent because it
says one company
It's it's is one business
support industry.
Thank you and I think the or
industry what caught my
attention to the that software
industry massive and then
curious why we would limit This
fund to ten percent thank you
madam speaker thank you
gentlemen it is per investment
but if you look at the next line
investments representing no more
than fifty one percent of the
total and so the the objective
here is to make sure that
individual investments aren't
out are taking up an out sized
role in in the fund itself but
that each investment can
continue to grow in that that
space does that make sense of
somewhat I I still think we're
limiting ourselves by choosing
that ten percent number but I'm
not going to ask you to amended
and I'm not even going to advise
you to do that I just that
caught my attention I was
curious how you arrived at the
ten percent number and I
appreciate your explanation
madam speaker in July from Santa
Fe this lonely to questions
