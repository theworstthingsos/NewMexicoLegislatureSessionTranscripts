consistently seen failed
leadership we're here where
she's put in place under

secretary that wrecked havoc on
secretaries and the only thing
that remains consistent is the
increasing number of dead kids
under our watch with the
secretaries I have very little
faith and very little confidence
made good on those promises you
also stated how important it was
for you to keep schools open and
the easiest thing to the
superintendent could a secretary
could have done during these
times was immediately closed

for bringing this concrete to

well Mr president but I will say
and sometimes we do need to get
off our chest ever feeling about
things I have every faith in the
world that this secretary is
going to listen to everybody on
is.
I immediately knew when he took
the job because it was
incredible how a lot of the W.
secretaries and the directors of
this that I serve nine years on
some secretaries and I work very
closely with even in the
previous administration every
now and then we'd have a chat
about this and that but I just

many years when I first came

that I learned from Secretary
Stein house is the mannerism in
which you deal with people and
with things in your your kind
had a great opportunity to
visit.
He has learned a lot about
southeast New Mexico and
actually your experiences and
Alamogordo very similar to the
rural areas.

better off for teachers are
going to be better off our
superintendents are going to be
better off and I just thank you
so much for agreeing to do this
and you have my full support and

do other things well too bad at
play them in the we listen in on
the your committee hearing today
and I heard what people around
sexy but I think important which
is what we're dealing with with
COVID getting kids back in the
classroom is that as we learn
more about how we deal with
kind of where the ball game is
shifted I know it's very
expensive work and I've asked
some of the school districts in
hearings about what are you
doing a different ones are doing
within schools for ventilation
systems some leadership from the
top down asking us for the money
that's needed I think this would
be a great thing to do during

Senator.
before is a bill that deals with
the public works minimum wage
act which requires the
department of workforce
solutions to set the wage and
fringe benefit rates for workers
determination of weight range
was pretty complicated and it
required wage surveys but in two
thousand nine this body adopted
collective bargaining
agreements.
And then and so that was two
thousand nine so that in two
thousand fifteen when this issue
was before the New Mexico
discretionary duty to separate
failing way traits and
prevailing fringe benefits rates
in accordance with collective
bargaining agreements.
But Mr president in practice
stay of the implementation of
the rates in the event that
anyone appeals either to the
labor industrial commission or
to a District Court.
implementation of the ruling but
that's not what this REC does.
As a result what this rug has
done is to create a procedural
seen is that folks are are using
this read to file appeals just
to get the state and the drawing
those appeals out so that the
works minimum wage act first it
states that the those annual
race to take effect on January
first have to be set by October
first we should render moot the
need for at the state of the
proposed rates before that the
effective date the second change
stay that was someone who is
seeking a state they have to go
to court and show good costs.
It's important to note that
these changes don't deny anyone
that all of the contractors
associations the testified in
the committees that heard this
bill are supported including the
associated general contractors
of New Mexico the mechanical
with that Mr president all stand
for questions thank you centers

Diamond as part of the
introduction of the bill.
Senator just a reminder we are
in third reading if we can keep
the volume down.
So the presenters can be heard
Senator Diamond.
Thank you Mr president.
bees and I sat next to a co
sponsor of this bill Senator
Ryan lane and noted the uncanny
similarities the dilemma that
these characters were facing
those characters
Show the relationship that we as
elected officials have with our
constituents on polar opposite
pass the best policy we can when
we're United.
And so I want to say there's
been a lot of misinformation
about this bill there's two
election bills out there and I
know there's a lot of people
asking that we come together and
do and although this is a
lengthy Ivey Soto bill this is
not shot gun legislation by any
on my side for coming together
with the leadership over here
and coming up with the best bill
that we can considering the
circumstances.
I do want to address some of the
many improvements to Senate bill
six includes one this bill
requires the secretary of state
It prohibits absentee
applications provided by third
parties.
What this bill does not do is it
I have learned a lot in the last
week after signing on to Senator
Ivey Soto is bill as an elected
official here I've learned you
create the best voter integrity
and transparency bill that we
can.
I feel satisfied accomplished in
doing that and getting this here
and I'm proud to to join them in
can hit it's left open ended
I'm I'm not open ended here and
committed to creating the best
policy and I feel like we've
done this in this bill I want to
think again my leadership and I
I stand for any questions with
my co sponsoring this.
We do have further debate will
have Senator Padilla followed by
Senator Moores center by the and
things as Senator Diamond just
mentioned this is this is a good
bill it is somewhat imperfect in
some places along those lines I
committee there was a motion to
strike the provisions related to
the middle Rio Grande
Conservancy district we did a
motion on the fly we missed a
couple sections we will remove
that there was a concern that
was raised on the on the mail
ballot verification process as
to the sequencing of separating
the inner envelopes from the
you've completed that
verification process
and then and then the third
thing is that there is with
regard to local government
be adjusting that to the current
school board level of sixteen
thousand so I just wanna let
folks know those three issues
for the F. followed by Senator
Moores center for the thank you
very much Mr president thank you
very much to the sponsors for
the introduction here on the
floor and and the background and
I appreciate Senator Ivey Soto
sponsor would yield or Sanchez
why don't we just fix that here
so we don't go through the.
You know the tangle of having to
have it come back and do a
number of things and then what
amendments to the for a number
of subjects so why why do we not
have that here if he's willing
to comment on that Senator so to
yield Mister president I do
Senator Moores Jeff question
your question on that expert
witness how is anyone to do we
just a dollars that Senator Ivy
Soto was not the expert in this
topic by asking for an expert
experience.
Purcell yes thank you Mr
president and somebody the
reason for doing so is because
these statutes are actually
proponent of the motion as well
as with some of the other people
who raised some concerns we
agreed to go ahead and move it
out as we did that make sure
then that we get it right so
a risk that any sponsor has to
evaluate.
Thank you Mr president I I ask
this question in committee when
I had the opportunity the one
we're gonna fix this when it
moves over the side of the
building so I'm very concerned
about that I don't know why we
don't fix that here so that we
don't send the bill over there
and have any number of other
things happen to it
out of this chamber if we want
to get it right why wouldn't the
Senate to introduce the bill the
the body that fixes it that's
all I have thank you Mr
president.
Further debate with senator
here two years we've had as a
nation and I've committed to
Senator Ivey Soto and others
that I wanted to work together
on election bill in a bipartisan
on other things this bill that
center so it wasn't fully happy
with this is a good piece of
legislation and when we do agree
the rest it down and work
make better legislation such
some poor some of you who are
new to this chamber to learn so
we used to do in the Senate and
I really wouldn't and dedicated
to getting back to that model.
comes to things that we can work
together let's work together and
come up with damn good pieces of
legislation Mister president so
let this be a lesson everyone
here I'm proud of the this
process from and what we've done
Thank you senator Morris we do
have further debate with senator
Ortiz Y. Pino followed by
Senator about this then Senator
Woods.
Thank you Mr president and
It's not the that the changes he
was suggesting that they go
through aren't good changes.
It's just that.
vote on a matter that that
they've been operating under for
the last fifty years and so it
vote and so for that reason we
move to to to deal with them in
a separate piece of legislation
next year he's committed to
working with them over the
involving a sake is rural over
urban division who gets to vote
in the elections all of that is
up in the air and fair game for
to thank Senator for doing that
and
you know what when it comes back
for concurrence we will be
looking very carefully to make
sure that we got all of those
pieces removed carefully thank
present center Padiham had
comments that I think are
important for me to
re emphasize because I share his
concerns.
And I I consider I'm concerned
And and we should not set the
precedent here of a passing
legislation.
Where we're promising to get it
fixed in the house.
gonna ask that that the Senate
give recovery of long thought to
this to this idea that that
we've acknowledges number things
that need to be on the bill but
and then where does that leave
us.
I'm just always concerned about
preserving the authority in the
integrity of this chamber the
Having the Senate send something
over to us to fix.
I can't imagine it.
And so let's be clear that if we
appreciate the bipartisanship on
all the good work this is not at
all to address the merits is to
address simply the process and
procedure.
To finish our work.
For us.
Very conflicted on how to vote
with this piece of legislation
because well I support the
Center every Soto and the other
spas can persuade me that this
is so unusual here that that we
need to take this extraordinary
step of sending it to the house
with the a lot of work still to
does in my experience in all the
years which is sending out an
excellent product.
I can't think of one example
ever.
We're we're my yes where my
think it's about president and
so I echo the comments of
Senator Padilla I hope will give
this more thought and and really
decide whether this is that
critical thank you Mr thank you
Senator what does it do have
Further debate Senator Woods.
Thank you Mr president this
quickly you know some of the
you know there's there's a huge
Question whether those voting
machines could be in the next
few lated.
Are about before the election
and after the election.
Mister chair Mister Senator so
thank you secretary much of US
And and so with the voting
machines that we have what we do
is up before the election there
is logic and accuracy testing of
for the election day machines
and so we just.
In that one of these are doing
this bill is making sure that
applies equally so that it's
always done in public people can
When the machine to use the and
you run zero tape on the machine
so people could see that there's
no votes on that machine and
then once the voting is
completed.
were actually the very first
state in the country to go to a
risk based post election audit.
And so we do a post election
audit where where certain
don't say just the general
action under this bill after
every election we do post
election audits.
And under this bill that post
election audit will include
addition to that because we use
paper ballots were able to
recreate election.
I don't know how many of you
remember was about twelve years
ago.
We had a state land commissioner
to go through and recreate that
election without having to
depend upon the machines that
counted initially the the
election the vote we're able to
it didn't change the outcome at
all but the but the public had
cut greater confidence to that
point in terms of what happened
so so these are the procedures
that New Mexico go through with
amount of discussion about
algorithms different things like
that of would you like to
comment on that just a minute
constituents Mr president
Senator Ivey Soto.
Senator thank you Mr president
certainly the.
going to that postelection
audits for every statewide
election.
Are there are people who have
tried to predict how the votes
And the reason we have elections
is because people in fact
actually aren't robots threes we
have elections people have
opinions and they vote in
unexpected ways if we're merely
of other people that never would
have been elected.
But their elected because we're
dealing with people and we're
dealing with actual votes that
are taking place the issue then
becomes what is that what is
particularly for those local
elections where you have fewer
votes being cast is we're
guaranteeing an automatic
recount not only fewer than one
you're outside of one percent.
And so we're guaranteeing if
you're within five us you're
going to get an automatic
recount so that people have
confidence in what has happened
in our elections.
those visuals that I see and I
can be completely wrong which of
have been many times in the past
but I kind of believe that that
because of that and I attribute
some of those of spikes assume
grant with that so I I have a
lot of belief in myself in the
watch that process watch those
actually.
In day voting
it was quite a process is quite
a checks and balance system and
Count that they did and they
they would put those things in a
tray Senator common was there
for that system not to be
perfect.
So Mister president
It's hard to read every page of
the bill like this and
understand it completely.
Senator pope followed by
Senator.
C. Lopez the chairman had up
Senator Lopez and for a second
eloquent as they were but being
new to the Senate I know we move
on bills from committees and
they are amended at the next
committee my concern is you know
sponsor if there's any way that
we can delay this or minutes
before going on thank you Mr
president thank you senator for.
We do have for the debate
Senator Sedillo Lopez.
and and I told him I had
questions that I thought would
be more in line with the
committee process and not with
the not with the floor process
it he said he really appreciated
answered there's a lot of detail
in this bill that would normally
be of.
Regulations but because of the
requires this level of detail.
And the only thing that we ended
up I mean that he explained but
I think it's important for him
audiotapes within the polling
place when
of when you're dealing with the
challenger photographs are
allowed although the ballot be
not be photographed I totally
to being out of in trading
challengers one of the things we
used to tell them is take a
video so that there's evidence
later about what happened
evidence before it so I just ask
if the if the sponsor will yield
and and answer that question I
know you answered it for me but
Thank you Mr president thank you
Senator Sedillo Lopez see of
what the provision talking about
is on page nineteen of the bill
we're talks about that
that for not allowing any audio
or video recording in the
polling place is is a couple
fold the the first is because we
use the last four digits as the
Are in in the by the challenges
are watchers and that they don't
then start compiling a database
of people's protect the personal
information.
You have challengers who walked
in and said straight up to the
presiding judge I'm not gonna
listen to what you say I'm I'm
That's that's also one of the
issues but the main issue though
is the protected information
that we have for voters and
wanted to maintain that and to
specifically allow for
photographs to be taken as long
as they're not photographing
ballots are protected
information of any voter
and that way they are able to
information and to have a
baseline this is more protective
of of of of what Senate bill
seventy seven would do and of
course the more protective would
and I just want to know that
polling places don't normally
have mailed in ballots and so
that wouldn't it wouldn't be the
last four digits and I'll just
I'll just still made by
and over the years and I've been
doing election protection since
the first election after the Al
Gore election I constantly
volunteer for that I'm not
evidence except a he said she
said situation and.
Video or audio could really help
clear things up thank you Mr
president.
president was president at the
beginning this debates.
R. Senator Padilla raised a
concern about setting something
up with some promises of
matter be rolled over until
tomorrow where we can come in
with the floor amendment and we
can vote on it and I'll go out
with all of those provisions
already in the bill as it leaves
friends and colleagues in the
Senate.
I have an ulterior motive here I
I did not want to have senators
so instead of doing in the house
sitting in committees for the
Senate.
I thank Mr present want to thank
the sponsors for green to roll
over I think this is very
important and also helps to
maintain the integrity of the
Senate and I appreciate
everybody's comments thank you.
