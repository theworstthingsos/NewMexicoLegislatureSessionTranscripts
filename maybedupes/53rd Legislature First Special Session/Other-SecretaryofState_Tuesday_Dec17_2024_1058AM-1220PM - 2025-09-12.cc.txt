How
OK.
Uh, good morning. Uh, welcome to
the meeting of the presidential
electors for the state of New
Mexico or the 2024 presidential
election. I'm Secretary of State
Maggie Toulouse Oliver, and it
is an honor.
to convene this historic meeting
of New Mexico's presidential
electors here in 2024.
Uh, today, as required by both
our state and federal laws, you
will fulfill your duty.
To cast New Mexico's electoral
college votes for president and
vice president of the United
States.
This process reflects the
strength of our democracy.
The will of the voters.
And the peaceful transition of
power.
And I want to thank each of you
for your service and upholding
this cornerstone of our nation's
electoral system.
Uh, so with that, thank you
again for your participation
today. I'm gonna turn it over to
our state election director,
Mandy B. Hill, to explain the
process of what we'll be doing
here today.
Thank you, Secretary Toulouse
Oliver, and welcome all of you.
Good morning. Thank you so much
for being here. Um, we have a
couple of meetings to conduct
this morning in accordance with
state statute. So the first one
has begun now at 11:00 a.m. It
will be what we're calling the
organizational meeting, so it is
an opportunity for all of us to
kind of come together, I'll go
through what you can expect in
both sessions, um, and then you
will select your committee
members, so you'll have to elect
a chair and a secretary.
Um, and then the second portion
actually by law cannot begin
until noon. Um, so we'll start
at noon where you will be
organized as a formal committee,
and then you'll have an
opportunity to actually cast a
vote on a ballot, and so we have
some members of our team here.
We're joined by Charlotte
Chanana, who is our deputy
election director and Anastasio
Trujillo, who is going to
support for the BOE. So if you
need any help um with anything,
we're certainly here to help
you, um, but ultimately we'll
kind of conduct things. We'll
start out with a
roll call, if you have any
opening remarks after we kind of
conduct the roll call, you are
more than welcome to do so. I
know that we have an alternate
participating. Thank you for
being here. And so we have a
formal vacancy that we'll need
to fill, and there's a bit of a
process in which you'll sign a
document and so that we can kind
of create that formal record and
then we'll provide all of that
to the National Archives at the
conclusion of the meeting.
Um, the chair will run the
meeting at noon, and the
secretary will be responsible
for creating a formal record or
what we're calling the journal.
Um, so that formal record is
something um we have some
guidance for you that we can
share with you as well.
What else do we have here? Um,
the, um, there are 6 original
copies which we have termed the
certificate of vote, and so all
of you will get an opportunity
to not only cast a ballot, but
then there is a certificate of
vote and that each of you will
sign along with the secretary,
um, and that will be provided uh
again to National Archives, and
there will be a formal national
vote to tally all of those
electoral votes on January 6th.
So, um, we have prepared
everything here today, you will
take, um, the lead and really
just sealing everything, so
you'll be the last hands to
touch it on behalf of the state
of New Mexico and then they'll
be off um to DC at the
conclusion of this meeting. So
once we have kind of organized
at 11, the second portion will
be at noon. Again, there will be
a roll call, um, we will
go ahead and um
Let me see here. We'll pass out
the ballots essentially. You
just need to cast your vote. Um,
we'll collect all the documents
and send them off, so not
necessarily a lot to it unless
you all have any questions, we
are happy to answer them.
All right. Well, with that, um,
we can go ahead and we'll ask
for a formal roll call. We'll
let Charlotte conduct that, and
then again at the conclusion of
that you are more than welcome
to um go forward with any
opening remark.
So thank you, um, Patricia
Gaston.
Harold Murphy.
Julie Rockman?
Alitawazo?
And then our alternate Clayton
Cate.
Do any of you have any
introductory remarks you'd like
to make? OK, go ahead, Julie.
So I just want to thank my
fellow electors for being here.
It's an awesome responsibility
that I know each of you take
seriously, and I'm I'm proud to
be here with you. I also want to
thank Maggie, um, who continues
to be a very bright light in
terms of secretaries of state
and making sure that every vote
here is protected, and every
vote here is counted and the
democracy is working very well
in the state of New Mexico. I
hope that we are uh a role.
I hope you are a role model that
other secretaries of state are
following and thank you to the
staff for taking such great care
of us.
I'm gobsmacked by the whole
thing.
OK, uh, with that, um, we will
do the formal organization, um,
and, and what that means
essentially is, um, and, and
before we um we adjourn and, and
then reconvene, uh, as your
formal organized board, we need
to conduct an election or chair.
And for secretary as Mandy kind
of outlaid just earlier. So, um,
with until we have a chair, I'll
go ahead and, and, and run the
meeting um through the selection
process. Uh, so with that, do I
hear any nominations for chair.
Of the elector.
OK, spike.
Are there any other nominations?
actually should, is there a
second? I should ask?
OK.
80.
OK. Are there any other
nominations?
All those in favor of Spike,
please say hi. Hi.
Are there any opposed?
All right, Mr. Murphy, you are
the chair.
Of the electors for 2024 here in
New Mexico.
Congratulations.
Are there any nominations for
secretary?
Is there a second?
OK.
Tricia Gaston.
Any other nomination.
Right, uh, all those in favor of
electing Ms. Gaston as the
secretary.
And he opposed.
With that congratulations, Madam
Secretary.
Uh, and so with that, um,
Unless there are oh, the
vacancy, OK, do you wanna handle
that one, Mandy?
Sure.
All right. So I think that we
have a vacancy and kind of the
original um set of electors, and
so at this point, we will need
to just formally, um, kind of,
um, elect the 5th alternate. So
Charlotte, would you walk us
through that process?
Yeah, so, um, I'm
sorry, Chairman Murphy, you'll
be able to um call for that
motion in a second um to
officially um nominate, um, Mr.
Cote, and then we'll have a form
for you all to sign, and then
these um certificates of
appointment will go with the um,
the rest of the documents to the
archivist replace Mr. Diaz, who
resigned as one of our
alternates, or sorry, one of our
electors.
I call for emotion.
Yeah
Collect an alternate.
Eleor
I move that we elect Clayton is
an all.
All those in favor
All those opposed.
Yeah, yeah.
Welcome.
Perfect. And so now we'll just
have you officially kind of sign
And just for anyone who is
attending virtually just wanna
share a little bit of an update.
So we are kind of concluding the
organizational portion, um, of
this, and I think um all of the
electors have, um, signed and uh
officially elected and so we
have 5 official electors. We
have a chair, we have a
secretary, and so we will
adjourn shortly, um, we will
maintain the webcast of this for
everyone who is observing, um,
virtually, but just so you know,
there will not be.
another action once we adjourn
until we can again begin at noon
and that is in accordance with
state law. So we'll have a bit
of a pause and then we'll come
back and actually take uh kind
of conduct the vote at noon, um,
but I'll let the chair kind of
conclude us um by a journey.
I motion to adjourn.

Um,
On behalf of the state of New
Mexico and um on behalf of um
our indigenous people here, um.
In New Mexico.
So, thank you.
I would just like to say it's an

And it's an honor to be with my
fellow electors, Secretary of
State, her staff.
Mm, yes. Thank you.
I'd say thank you again to the
staff. I appreciate the
diversity of the electors here.
I think this reflects the
strengths of our state, um, as a
second generation American, I'm
just a struck again to be here.
And uh just say thank you, Madam
Secretary, Chair, Madam
Secretary, and the staff.
I thought this would be.
Rather dry.
Boring ceremony, and I was dead
wrong.
It's been an inspirational.
Uh, I'd like to conclude with.
Uh, some words.
At the Democratic National
Convention.
At the Democratic National
Convention of 1960.
1960, they nominated a young
senator from Massachusetts.
Who had this to say upon
accepting the nomination.
We stand on the edge of a new
frontier.
The problems are not all solved.
And the battles are not all won.
Of what I speak
It's not what I intend to offer
the American people.
But what I intend to ask of
them.
So my words, uh, we ask of you.
All of us
You continue your participation
in public life.
And for our public services to
continue their excellent
service.
In their public service.
Last thing
Um
Quotation from his
inaugural speech
Uh
With a clear conscience?
Our only sure reward.
And with history the final judge
of our deeds.
Let us go forth to lead the land
we love.
Asking for his help.
And his blessing.
Knowing that here on earth.
God's work must truly be our
own.
Thank you.
Mr. Chair, if I may, just some
final concluding remarks on
behalf of my staff and me, um,
and I do also want today to
acknowledge our state's county
clerks, poll officials, election
officials at all levels for the
amazing work that they did.
With the selection, um.
This particular uh process
today.
Is it particularly meaningful
for me because uh this is the
3rd.
And final, uh, convening of the
electors that I will have um
overseen as Secretary of State
and my 5th and final
presidential election that I
will have.
Either run at the local level or
here at the state overseening at
the state level and so it's
particularly meaningful to me to
be here with you all today. And
I want to thank you all for
serving our state as members of
the Electoral College and
ensuring that our democracy and
our traditions and the rule of
law.
Peaceful transfer of power.

all of you and to my staff, and
to everyone in New Mexico who
makes elections possible. Thank
you.
Oh, I know motion to adjourn.
Do I have a motion to adjourn.
