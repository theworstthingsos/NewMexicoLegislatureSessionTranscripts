Thank you Senator Griggs but if
back to the point on on wasting
time and I have just by the way
worked out a consent calendar
me but I I don't see it as a
waste of time for two reasons
one is if we do a two thirds
vote and as you have said
there's a lot of bipartisan
support for this then we could
When when any governor has a
bill sitting on on his or her
desk there's a public process
they're they're gonna receive
phone calls gonna receive
Because they're they're still I
think is some partisanship
inside this this debate.
And I I will be supporting this
as it seems like you have been
for the last couple of weeks.
and it seems all you're asking
for is just for a bill that
comes down bipartisan supported
sitting on our third reading
most of my constituents do the
majority of them what I'm
hearing from them is.
They're saying things like well
the you know the governor's a
decision they see this emergency
powers as regressive so we have
a lot of people here that the
state their purpose of.
But I hear a lot of people
And then if you lean left.
What I've heard from them as
they said look I'm sick and
tired of people calling our
governor dictator.
there's it's been a group
decision and so miss president
and senator if I could ask a
specular question don't if you
don't wanna speculate I I
respect that but if this bill
maintenance are you asking
Senator Baca yield.
Mr president I believe he

think you would be identical to

that's the my my bottom line
there.

rural divide is called oral
maybe in that that's a combined
one were there let's let's join
together there are partisan gap.
disagree with the governor they
say okay fine at least at least
it was a group decision and I
agree with you I think that this
body would have approved
on the left say okay no there's
approve our governor is not
acting like a dictator because
look all the legislators from
around New Mexico got together
in these they they voted to
approve the the health order.
provided by needs to look at how
to do that.
We have to we we live as a wise
Senator in this body has said
over and over again during this
but I don't want to debate the
merits of the bill that's not
really what we're debating right
now we're debating the motion.
But I I I'm gonna vote for this
election still trust in this
governor I believe.
For the reasons I've I've stated
before.
And it's going to help us bridge
the gap.
thank you Mr president there are
for the debate for informational
purposes for the body will have
senator Morris o'neill well it's
Brandt then Ivy Soto said Moores
Motion my apologies no no on the
in this chamber can argue my
my knowledge ment of the
severity of the public health
orders are the of the public
owners chamber can argue that
I opposed the governor's orders
on because I did a very good
conversations from support of
the governor's orders at the
beginning because it it had very
in the Mr president so that's
why this this motion has nothing
about the current health orders
on that have been going on for
years nothing about the current
health orders is about a
power to the executive I think
it was bill Richardson at the
time Mr president and there only
one person at a the fear that
was going on at that time felt
was coming down the pike with
too much executive power you
know we talked about two number
discreetly to my previous
speakers we're not a co equal
the Roman Republic Senator.
The founders did not intend us
to be a co equal intended us to
Congress had the power to tax.
Because of the power to our to
spend money Congress had the
power to declare war.
ironically to come into
existence until around then it's
only in years when Nixon was
trying to claim that he was co
equal so that he can have to
give up his documents during
power and like I mentioned we're
based off the Roman Republic.
The Roman Republic had an
officer called a dictatorship
it's not to do a to criticize
any current governor anything
be in battle and want to be in
charge one day the other would
be in charge of the day because
the Senate's Roman Republic's
feared a powerful executive.
That dictator would have power
unlimited power to control the
Roman Republic.
For six months.
Six months thank you had

wars to dictator took over.
As soon as the battles won the
dictator would resign a move on.
Republic when the dictator
didn't resign did it move on.
And was no longer the Roman
Republic it was the Roman
Empire.
Now Republicans not Democrats
we're supposed to push back to
get the executive Mister
president.
And that's what's concerning and
this body has a history of that.
our Charles side of the aisle
introduced a veto override
message our Republican against
Republican governor.
Introduced that reserve that
motion to over ride ride a
Republican because this body
thought it was the right thing
to do.
I worked upstairs during the
the veto of a good budget.
Call the self into extra
ordinary session.
had a lot of disagreements with
Michael Sanchez when he was here
politically but he stood up for
this body.
He stood up for this body Craig
Brandt stood up for this body I
was a guest party he put his
party side.
So while you are on Mr president
elected we all got along but
don't you could you address
My response was I can't.
Because twenty odd years ago
Legislature abdicated its power
I couldn't do anything so this
is an important part can't think
One for me Mr president
there's three license plate
bills on the agenda ahead of
this position we can find the
time we all the time to the
of the last year I want to talk
about the future and what we do
next time and I have our
commitment at this amount motion
carries and we do debate this
I'm not gonna make it alright
because it is going to happen
happen Onge years ago.
With globalization hi you
happened years ago with the
Spanish flu or globalization
it's going to happen again
clerk knows the family after the
Spanish flu is mother whose
parents passed away they're not
Spanish flu up in Espanola.
I know and I grew up hearing
those stories about would be was
we are at the table or the for
our successors are at the table
to deal with this because
hopefully you and I will be
here.
Hopefully will be another group
this happens again this
president thank you.
Senator nail thank you Mr
president and members just
briefly here let's let's just
talk about where we are here
bill has been languishing for
weeks I'm sorry I've been
reading this can I maybe I have
been reading it closely enough
it hasn't been on here for weeks
you know there's a lot of bills
seventy four yes I welcome this
discussion but let's talk about
the real issue here is
reclaiming our power as
provided but it isn't it doesn't
come down to whether you know
the specific motion is to make
this the next order of business
here Senator savant this has a
wonderful bill that would would
a.
Make it easier for us to call
ourselves into an extraordinary
should be able to call ourselves
in to an extraordinary session
easier than what the way it is
now.
Also my colleague over there in
we in my case you know you
school the corrections
department and they do the same
thing because there's no
oversight that's the real issue
it doesn't come down to whether
discussion how to reclaim our
power so it just doesn't come
down to making this next order
of business thank you.
Thank you senator nail just for
those winter remember we have
business that is what we are
currently debating Senator
Woods.
Thank you Mr president.
And I wonder why in the world.
Did we want to succeed.
The second paragraph it says of
this recreation says we hold
these truths to be self evident.
That all men are created equal
That to secure these rights
governments are instituted among
men.
Depriving.
There are.
those people to alter or to
abolish it.
Not quit reading there because
there's gonna be plenty of
debate I'm sure are inspired
debate now.
I am sure that I inspired that
I would call your attention to
that since.
Because Mr president.
A bill.
That has to do with the numbers
GNC walls.
That was set up to run.
And taking personal property
away from people.
Taking religious freedoms away
from people.
And we're putting all this tire
in one person's hands during the
way.
With the separation of powers
But I remind everyone outside
that there is a fence out there
there are state policemen
guarding the entrance to hear.
With an automatic rifle over
their shoulder and I know that
that is that just unheard of to
Please that is a very this.
Statement outside with that fits
in the state police here.
Thank you Mr president.
And I think senator Morris for
for reminding us.
Of.
The action that I took several
Several others.
Encouraging me.
Stood with me four years ago as
I took a very unpopular.
Why.
Because we all agreed.
Most of us agreed.
Have that debate on this floor
and yes it took a lot of time.
And you know what we knew
because.
She had made a very clear.
This Legislature ceded their
power.
Wrongly.
I think the the you know I
didn't agree with the Michael
Sanchez on a whole lot.
But he was right.
The courts have upheld that this
governor has absolute authority
in this situation.
Why because the legislature gave
it to her.
The bill has been on the
calendar.
For close to if not already
This was one of the.
I thought maybe we were gonna do
it that night.
I quite frankly.
We should be able to have any
discussion on this for when a
bill has passed both committees
And that we shouldn't violate
the process.
Well this bill's gone through
the process.
Mr president this bill went
Shorten the process for those
bills and we've agreed to
shorten the process for those
bills this bill didn't shorten
the process.
It went through two committees.
No other bill has sat on the
calendar for that long.
This one just.
So what we're asking today.
discussion and decide as a body.
Whether or not this bill should
be sent to the house.
For concurrence.
been told the last nine years.
They get some we're gonna have
to discuss in the future.
Most of the bill goes through
Well let's talk about this bill.
We want to have the discussion
I along with senator Morris
agreed with the governor's order
to begin with.
Let's have that discussion.
I grew Senator o'neill there's
some other bills we ought to be
hearing as well.
But they haven't gone through
the legislative process yet.
Let them take the course that's
I think that this is something
we need to do something we need
to have secession that we need
to have on the floor as to
whether or not we want to see
that and greatly concerns me
that we continue to give away
the power of this chamber.
We continue to say well we're
volunteer legislature so let's
let's do it thank you Mr
president.
Further debate we're Senator

This is an issue that we all
know is out there every single

The way we have to deal with
that.
Is this bill or bills like.

there's possibility that won't.

Thank you Mr president I in I
the matter here's really our own

And I understand fully at times
the frustration that comes in

had that happen

with the majority floor leader I

It'll come over to the Senate we

to explain what the build us.
Thank you Mr president and.
Because this bill what was
already presented a last Monday
its title I and it's been the
subject of extensive
negotiations and discussions
after it was on the floor here
last week it was and sent back
dealt with uninsured patients
and sent seven prices at a
hundred fifty percent of
Medicare for uninsured patients
New the revenue floor for third
independently for those services
the revenue for for those folks
was raised from five million to
twenty million.
So those are the changes that
were made in in the Judiciary
but I I appreciate the work that
everyone has put in on this bill
from working with extensively
was senator share to the work
done in the Senate Judiciary
Mexicans and help our medical
community by reducing
uncompensated care so with that
I will stand for questions
Mister president thank you
senator Hey we do have debate on
think that's a slippery slope
that that we're gonna get into
this body remember we all sleep
we all go home we spend time
away and so to to come to the
body deserves to be reminded
have the the substance of the
bill explain because we're
making decisions that affect the
entire state so we should not Mr
and have and it can make an
informed decision thank you Mr
president thanks in part to any
further debate on the bill
centers we have Senate office
and Mr president unanimous
From the of interest I'm sorry
just totally mixed up Mister
president unanimous consent to
excuse Senators Steinborn and
Senator Stefanics.
Same objection.
Any further debate.
want to commend the bill sponsor
on this bill
Who is clearly.
Sure a lot of perseverance.
you know it's such a and so I I
have a great deal of respect for
that and the bill sponsor has
personally been very
professional when I approached
her about this legislation and
certainly miss present thank you
very much Senator
And I just want to ask a few
things about where this bill is
ended up I do want to make it
And you know I'll just read it's
one sentence and I think we can
boil this bill down literally to
one sentence on page six.
a medical debt shall not be
pursued through collection.
Would you agree that's kind of I
mean if if we had to boil it
down with me centers that.
These at the heart of this bill.
you for doing that I.
It's it's unfortunate though
that I I I simply cannot support
the bill in its current form and
respect for your willing ness to
compromise
but when there's something in in
a bill that really violates your
own belief system or conscience
and I just wanted to give you
know a brief time to explain why
that is but I want to first are
in section for that that is a
remarkable thing we're doing and
I think section four is going to
And in my opinion.
What section three is doing is
we are making.
Now go to the definition
In any center that's affiliated
with the hospital birth center
the nursing home and mental
health center.
required to screen individuals
and sign them up for health care
insurance I mean that's that's a
health care insurance companies
dream to to force in statute
payments or annual payment or
whatever may be.
for for those premiums in for
then you know for whatever this.
And so that's really my problem
there I think that helps protect
the smaller places
the birthing center that we use
in Albuquerque I didn't call
But I don't know why we have to
force these entities to sign.
Bill up for another corporations
product that that's really my
issue with the bill.
few specific questions on that
on that matter that I would like
to discuss and I think would be
fruitful for the body
we have been.
And when my wife goes to.
A doctor's office or a hospital
or wherever they see that
they'll say oh you don't have
To sign people up for insurance
without this section three.
Mr president Senator I would
think that any health care
but I do want to address just
one part of the question you you
were you were posing
because you said that that you
don't they shouldn't be forced
require the the facilities to
offer making offer to verify
whether the and if requested
then go ahead and verify whether
appreciate the language in the
bill that it's not a
it's not this robotic mandate
we're we're just saying okay you
that but if we follow the
algorithm of this bill on page
five you know it says they shall
take the steps the they're gonna
They're going to if requested
they're gonna screen for all of
the available public insurance
year with my wife
just as an example so if they
don't have someone working there
that knows about all available
public insurance.
And if we go further down to
assist with the application
process if requested so is that.
Is that your understanding
going to provide guidelines on
the screening process and HSD
will provide training so the
folks are able to to provide
for that Mr president center my
it is my understanding that if
the facility currently does not
have the the resources or the
conditions on page five.
Mister president senator I I
just so all health care
providers are already checking
patients for programs like
Medicaid and and this is these
are things that can be done over
the phone.
Facilities that don't currently
screen are gonna again increase
within these facilities I don't
know why there would be a
requirement to hire an
additional person for that Mr
president.
it in fact so much so that my
own wife is is annoyed every
time she she goes places just
gets berated without all these
insurance questions and I just
want everyone to know that yes
facilities they want their
patients to have insurance
because they if they see an
uninsured patient Mister
president the does have
insurance and they think well we
my once again one of my deep
standing principles as as a
conservative as person a person
who dislikes further regulation
the intent of this bill but the
way that I see it in my medical
practices all the regulations
that that come on and by the way
there's no I don't have any
conflict of interest here.
cancer patients and he would
kind of.
Kind of make a light as to
what's happening so look at all
look at world the nurses are
treating all the computers.
And he was right.
And the nurses are there in
front of computers.
God bless some the people want
to be in front of the patients
and I've heard from this body
something that people are
already doing I completely agree
Senator Duhigg they're already
doing a lot of this so far we've
now putting a mandate and I
think this empowers insurance
You got it ninety nine percent
right.
Million no what you missed line
twenty three didn't put it on
let them do that.
And so I I was tempted in in the
in the original version of this
bill I was going to bring
amendment to strike section
three but in a very professional
I I just want to really press on
this body that when we put
regulations in place even well
meaning regulations you know
that the majority of our of our
health care heroes are well
companies and and I've seen a
lot of health care legislation
go through in past couple years
my time in the in the health
committee in the house and their
well intended their well
really that's my only hold up on
this bill it really really is I
I love the heart of this bill I
don't think we should be going
after poor people for
collections in medical debt
there's a lot I could spend a
don't have any announcements
anyway and and what what are we
doing that the that has no place
in health care and that's why I
love that's why I love section
for now I have a question
I'm in section six it says all
bills sent from a health care
facility so Mister president
center is this.
Is this all of their bills or is
this only the bills.
whether they're indigent are not
they would be they would have
the right to have the
information that is listed there
which requires a plain language
Let me see what else there are
and if there is a third party
provider who's going to be the
billing separately.
Thank you Mr president and and
it all bills and why is it not
just indigent patients bills.
Mister president senator and and
I want to correct something I
just at the end there it these
bills would not disclose if
there is a third party person
Medical bills that have complete
in plain language descriptions
about what they are being billed
for and all patients should know
if that if there those charges
Thank you Mr president and and
etcetera I I just I bring that
up for the body because we we
sometimes you know people can
have a tendency just to vote for
a bill based on the the title or
specific to medical debt and
those things but subsection a is
not subsection a is word were
reforming health care for
everybody in that second in that
population
and maybe it's just a personal
preference but I want this I
don't know that that we are now
regulating billing for everybody
in in New Mexico under the
it's just once again going to be
a rabbit hole I think but I did
want to bring to the attention
of the body that the it says all
bills not just all and isn't
out I would vote for the bill in
a heartbeat
and I would do this other
concern I have is just a minor
one I can get over that
and so finally Mr presents under
bill was first heard but I kinda
liked the idea of the U. PA
building and but would you mind
just.
Updating me kind of what what
happened the judiciary
specifically with the U. PA.
and I committed to him to to
honor those agreements
and so and there was some
discussion about whether the PA
needs to be put back in are not
I respect that and I I don't
really need any more detail than
that
I I'm I just favored having the
all sorts of problems they can
cripple people financially.
And I would like to see a little
that was an issue or not but I.
I just think that we have an
opportunity to really
put some more teeth and put put
even more protection in there
needs needs protection.
In our very convoluted health
care system so wanna make an
unfair trade practice when you
get a bill fifteen months after
How is that fair why isn't that
qualify for the PA I would just
really like to see that put in
there and I I encourage another
member of the body of if you
agree with me then please bring
I don't expect to hear any
amendments on the floor I think
he's clearly shown a willingness
to fight for this bill fight for
section four specially.
Mister president hi I wish I
could vote in favor of section
four against section three but
that option is not going to be
presented to me today and
unfortunately quite
not be forcing people in my mind
to sign people up for insurance
companies products I don't think
it's the role of a doctor's
office or or nursing home or or
whoever else.
job is a job of health care
exchange to do that for people
in certain income brackets.
that's their job insurance
companies pay for that service
the next five years unfortunate
hope it doesn't happen but we've
we've introduced some conflict
of interest now making the
regulator that's another that's
another issue but that's the
health care exchanges job to do
against that because I I just
can't supported even though I I
really like the heart of this
bill thank you Mr president.
to the sponsor for allowing
hospital in my area to
communicate with I believe it
was the center online poverty
that this did with my my
normally hospital administrator
comment to me he he said they
were very excited about what he
already is doing with root
regard to this and but he said
at the end of the day when he
away but he already he already
does the things that are listed
in here and and I agree with
regard to many of the comments
offered the help they lay it all
out for the patient they said
this is what you're eligible for
this is what we can do to help
you get signed up but at the end
about the bill that I I see is a
problem so so we're holding the
facility's responsible we're
holding the hospitals
But at the end of the day they
don't have to sign up I know a
number of years ago I had an OB
drive in in my community so
line to make that person
eligible to to pay that drive
for the work that was done.
And many times they wouldn't
even do that and there was no
the day there's no requirement
that if you are eligible for any
of these if you're required to
actually sign on the line.
And that's my frustration in
Thinking about and I'm I
probably don't have the updated
amended bill so if I'm off track
just tell me that talking about
the requirements of section six
with regard to making sure that
all patients get full
information on the bill on
requirements in that section.
Mr president Senator Kernan
because an EEO be is not what is
not an actual bill it would not
amount nature of the charges
whether that the patient is
verified to be insured if
they've been screened for
assistance programs I and if you
But I do want to if if I could
address what you were saying
about normally because you're
absolutely right Mr president
Senator Kernan nor Lee is is a
has reduced their self pay
population by about half simply
by doing the screening
and and the screening that would
be required under this bill
I think that that might be an
issue that that they might have
gotten a a little lost in in the
discussion with senator she
meeting so I just wanted to
the enforcement and again I kind
of circle back around to the
fact that.
Disabilities are gonna be held
accountable and they should be I
mean we're we're talking about
we don't want to do harm to
normally to absolutely just did
wonderful work and then we for
many years we had a of another
hospital publicly.
attention to it so but they're
no they're no longer in the
county but.
Anyway so the enforcement.
Comes into play when hospital
accountable the the person that
we're trying to help because I
think I think if we can do that
not only are we helping the
hospital get reimbursed but
facilities accountable we're not
holding the other individual
accountable so I I don't know if
I really have a question on that
it's just kind of making a
statement that that we just need
to make sure that that
everybody's held accountable in
this particular instance with
that I'll I'll yield thank you.
working with him he really truly
appreciate sits on behalf of
senator Sherman's presence
Senator two eight I sent my
thanks in Senator Ivey Soto in
the rules this morning said
through the the process but I
definitely share Senator Kernan
said and Senator communities
comments about
that usually sticks my mind
because we disagree on so many
issues.
She said recently that we should
not do any more harm to small
businesses in New Mexico in the
middle pandemic that we're here
health care these are the few
folks Mister president we were
cheering if you remember
correctly people are going in
the hospitals nurses were going
hospitals and are being cheered
this to do health care harm and
then during the debate on this
bill it was mentioned that well
here time the nurses and doctors
say they leave the state they
never do.
your shut down in the nation Mr
present because it was it was
argued by the governor that we
don't have enough doctors.
There was also none of hospital
beds in New Mexico so we had
gymnasiums over in Gallup
converted to hospitals the army
Hospital and Gibson because we
have no possible bids so the
notion that the doctor say every
time we pass a law that hurts
them the other leave home but
they never leave.
thirty eight hundred New
Mexicans died in the last year.
Because of the pandemic we shut
down the state because we don't
despite our severe how lockdown
because of many many issues
social economic issues health
care issues.
We do have enough facilities
because of doctors and nurses
retracted but it used to be one
or I might have improved over
the last ten years I'm not sure
that someone retract that
statement.
So New Mexico is hot so hurting
us in appropriate as Dr Schmidt
is just talked about.
You know the in the problem
isn't the positions I had a
personal issue with the hospital
so and my dad is like a hundred
doctors me says if that was a
one page bill I think you're the
proposal passing unanimously and
move on but it's not in this
bill is doing harm to hospitals
and doctors and nurses nurse
Insurance companies have
authorize here in New Mexico and
or or this bill does nothing to
hold them accountable just makes
Fourteen people in our business
whose job as artist newly talks
committee talked about is to
treat computers.
Fourteen employees.
just to get paid from the
insurance companies.
That's what the problem is Mr
president it's not the doctors
the nurses not enough
their report claim is denied we
have to yield it would and I
would appeal it is a game it's a
dance we have to do that
counseling and you know so I
away and we want that health
care but we're not willing to
pay for Mister president we're
not willing to pay that nurse
just sacrifice for health and
pick my interest on.
With the eel be explanation of
benefits from insurance
companies.
Well the this real languages
and so everyone in this bill we
had a bill of an issue dealing
with abortion.
We we sent to our laboratory we
instrument that we actually were
able to transfer over into chart
doing COVID testing COVID
started the EPA or the FTA
approved that instrument to be
the state when someone on test
positive for gonorrhea chlamydia
or any of the sexual transitions
transmitters these aids.
And we have a HIPAA compliance
The Senate plane milling which
communication to this patients
house.
That they have chlamydia.
On a patient communication Mr
president what effect close to
home in order to your husband
finds out.
With that husband is abuse of.
violation right there.
What if you had an abortion.
You have been notified in
writing plain language you had
an abortion.
Someone to send a letter to your
home your parents can intercept
you just had an abortion.
Or your committee with Andrea.
We're all for that but the
unintended consequences of this
bill are severe Mr president.
So really hope with the body
listens to those examples are
transitions Dimitar disease also
the letter goes home.
Been read.
Think about that minor child who
just had an abortion.
president another unintended
consequence of this bill.
So I appreciate the work that's
been done on this bill it's so
as a long way to go before takes
Senator Woods followed by
Senator Gallegos Senator Woods
thank you Mr president and I was
asking for a Senator Hickey
a video to a question.
Yes there was thank you Mr
president and and Senator
Hickey.
The burning question in my mind
my burning question is.
What's the long term
consequences of this bill.
President.
The long term consequence of
this bill is hello.
More people will be covered with
insurance.
hopefully something better is
gonna be coming along in the
next few years but it is what we
do right now is how the system
works.
Is because when I heard about
this bill It reach deep inside
me.
About an issue from the time I
know who were the worst throwing
people into bankruptcy.
Poor people.
The good little nuns who ran
consulted for continue to take
poor people to collections drive
into bankruptcy they're never
going to get the money and so
And the.
I'm sorry.
If my figures that so anyway
was on the founding exchange
board here I came back to the
board we're trying to get people
to sign up they're still fifty
to seventy thousand people who
that are required here so that's
that's my bucket of water.
And the I hope that the the fire
is out now.
And I try to take their lead
their advice.
As to what they said to me was
truthful honest.
today you're my experts and I'm
following your lead thank you Mr
president.
Thank you senator thank you Mr
president Senator Hickey we do
The field.
Mr president and senator I don't
know this may have been asked
already but in just trying to I
heard the bill in committee and
persons or just and indigenous
people.
Mr president Senator Gallegos I
some there are most of the bill
applies specifically to indigent
the billing transparency that
would apply to to all patients.
Thank you for that Mr president
and senator
and I know that's not statewide
but will there have to be
supplemental monies from the
this bill deals with is it
requires more transparency and
reporting requirements so that
so that we know how those
Mr president center I guess what
I was getting at is I know that
there's a certain pricing for
insured there certain pricing
heart attack yeah and and if I
got insurance my insurance page
at this level if I don't I pay
at this level Mr president and
I'm just wondering if in the
way they do their billing
misprint press present Senator
Mister president senator I guess
thank you I appreciate you
clarifying that I misunderstood
your question so so what you're
Thank you for that Mr president
etcetera so now we would not
have the clarification on a
chart or a website that would
show the two distinct prices is
that correct Mr prevention.
was taken out in part of the
negotiations with Senator share.
Thank you for that this presents
and center of those actually the
would be able to go to another
one state X. number of dollars
for this type service make the
judgment call but I thank you I
appreciate the dialogue I've
I've heard I've been in and out
Si no further debate.
Senator Duhigg to close on the
bill.
Thank you Mr president and and
concern about accountability on
on the part of the patient and
and and I think she's absolutely
right about that and so we made
sure that in drafting this bill
determination that let's say a
patient for some reason will not
give information that would
allow indigents the to be
determined and that the the
but are we part eliminated
provider liability when
individuals see could not be
determined initially
and and the debt is then sold or
that that can't be met if the if
the patient is not cooperating.
And I also want to.
Make real clear yeah one.
medical that are three times
more likely to postpone Care.
and so.
When when Senator was was was
with it increasing provider care
compensated care overall it's
also going to increase folks of
getting care and getting
preventive care and getting care
that nothing in this bill would
require any facility to work on
behalf of private insurers the
screening is only for public
assistance.
Saying that the folks that the
facilities already have an
incentive to do the kind of
screening that we see in this
bill and and we've seen that
Of people in New Mexico four
four hundred percent or below of
the federal poverty line which
means that they probably qualify
for some sort of assistance
eighty five percent of those
they have for indigent patients
which is that's that that's not
being paid I at San Juan mayor
San Juan regional Medical Center
paid in Union County it was as
high as seventy five percent of
their bad debt was for people
who were otherwise eligible for
up for Medicaid and other
should have an incentive to do
the screening already the fact
is a lot of them aren't and
there are notable exceptions
they give is compensated it will
also make sure that you met in
the gym New Mexicans and that
look low income New Mexicans are
getting the medical care that

appropriate money to buy buses

New Mexico to the doctors out of
state so that they can receive
care.
And that's reality telemedicine
Thanks in part of center city

Thank they take those that or

receiving Corona virus so Senate
bill two seventy six requires
due to the risk of what was
experiences during this time.
The bill amends the definition
of hazardous substances to
community from but liability
cooperative agreements and
private property provisions to
allow a regional volunteer team
and the reason we say regional
To assist in the accident

Thank you senator Senator is
Senator today of.
Yes Mr president I yield to the

Mister president senator.
The reason we say regional
leaving that up to the
discretion of the director is
or the expertise of the existing
entities are those that help out
but that there was a shortage in
which people became sick R. one
I appreciate that I just know
that in our secretary of the
state now they've got a really
qualified group Mr president
perceiving the hazard.
Exist it would be before the
government's determination I'm
just not sure how.

some sense that were already
In in some sense I am hoping for
the best that we will not be in
another situation of the sort of
what we were in.
Mister president senator.
With the city or county
facilities or I guess I'm just
trying to understand how of the
director would decide for
facilities.

legislature to address this
there are five pending cases in
our thirteen judicial districts
that raised the issue of the
constitutionality of this law

Thank you senator so just just a
reminder to the body is because

To a certain West Side guy over

any questions anymore now that
independent idea to debate the
amendment thank you.
I've always appreciated the
Abraham extradition reflected in
substantive right to a juvenile
to be represented by an attorney
during the context of a parole
hearing.
Mr chairman of members and I can
there they had with parole
hearings there with that was
afforded all the juveniles but I
know the adults systems much
Yes I yield.
This Mr president this bill has
nothing to do with the provision
proceed procedures and Mr
chairman of our Senator I would
add you know in these cases
attorneys are going to be
you know as much as possible I'm
just not sure you know we didn't
get into that the changing of
the parole procedures for adults
something that you know not just
these individuals but it but
ideally you know parolees should
have have the best possible
council as possible.
you know as as a matter of
practice and having
Representative adults and parole
proceedings have not represented
juveniles but I have
Representative adults and parole
proceedings you do you don't

told now.
could do to really improve the
systems is ensure that people
have a right to have their
lawyer in the room.
I inotes to.
bill thank you thank you senator
any further debate on the
amendment we have center
participate all followed by
Senator Moores on the amendment
etcetera anticipate a thank you
Mr president and with the
appreciate your explanation for
why the families of of the
victims of.
Might want to have this delayed
the didn't you already take care
hearing Mr president members you
know as one it's I and senator
as one is familiar with this
process
you know people are gonna care
offender which should be a
parole or not and and so I I
felt you know the amendment that
was offered in the that we
about what's going on with their
of sand with the with the people
that are victimized them so so
the the notion that you could
one of my colleagues refer to it
as the head in the sand
but it's honestly you know vast
majority of families affected
want to be part of it so so I I
think that's just an unrealistic
it's an amendment that really to
continue to be bothered by the
by the fact that that the whole
purpose of the bill is to accept
the fact that when somebody
your amendment does is it it
delays that chance.
In order to appease the the
families of the victims and to.
I know that they are far more
reason the the the the purpose
of the bill is to give them a
shot at rehabilitation not to
punish them for an additional
period thank you Mr president
president Senator into the into
your sentence this is huge and
that's that's a huge opportunity
for rehabilitation and honestly
work on your issues and if if if
you're if you're not ready to be
released then you're not ready
to be released and you need to
do you know more time and more
introspection so I have no
problem with the five years
thank you.
Senator Sedillo Lopez for second
time senator Morris things were
going to get back to the
amendment
and so Mister president such
retirement Isaac and Jacob R.
can't I mean sorry we look at
you look sharp Mr president
Senator back on the amendment so
my understanding is quickly is
that's fifteen years they get
years threshold parole hearing.
Five more years twenty years in
other words parole hearing
twenty five so you could
potentially have three three
Patrol purple hearings in the
that is correct thank you thank
you Mr.
We do have for the mesa
informational purposes on the
amendment will have Senator
Brandt center Kernan all of a
expanding the amendment is that
you're taking the parole
hearings which would have been
automatically done every two
years and making every five
years is our Mr president this
with with stakeholders we moved
it to I.
So after that initial hearing if
it's denied paroles tonight and
the next hearing is five years
later.
And Mr president Senator.
Completely and I will be proud
to vote yes on the amendment.
Okay thank you Senator Kernan.
but I do think you have worked
with the district attorney's and
and
that's important to me because I
think that it's very important
for this to be something that
at the end of the day I can
support the bill with the
amendment on and I hope that the
body will support the amendment
as well thank you thank you
senator and for a second time
doesn't have anything to do with
right to counsel but I want to
clarify that the bill does the
bill does I just I thought we're
have further debate on the
amendment Senate committee I'm

was still into the bill with the
the sponsor yield for just one
question on the amendment please

it is our president sorry and
this is me excuse me Senator
committee is that a question to
the sponsor of the amendment or
the sponsor of the bill thank
you Mr president I had asked
that question to the sponsor the
amendment and then he had
nothing in statute now like this

Thank you Mr president with the

Yes Mr president I yield thank
you Mr president thank you
that the under normal
circumstances current bill
circumstances if someone is is
found guilty of first degree
murder a youthful offender what
It is to find somewhere else I
can find I think it's over
fourteen.
Present I can look that up to be
is you know there's a numerator
crimes just like we have in the
and the adult system I believe
and there's another a new
merited crime severe crimes like
first degree murder second
but youthful offender make some
of the high profile crimes as
you read about in the paper
over the past decade or so if
they're useful offender than
goes into placement after age
twenty one and so forth but the
here we're talking about
juveniles that have been sense
as adults.
So it's it's we're in the adults
around.
seventeen is it up to age twenty
one what what is a youthful
offender is president the ages
fourteen of with the murder with
murder in the first degree and
so fifteen plus is fifteen to
seventeen is that right so once
for eighteen dollar consider
youthful.
That's correct they're adults Mr
president thank you and and
Is
Make you aware.
Youthful offender.
Who commits.
And the this presents us I'm non
attorney and I've never served
on the Judiciary Committee so
again are honorary board agree
could you tell me what what what
murder felony murder and
Mr president when I was in law
school I used to be able to see
Mr president Senator Candelaria
sings like you like to jump in
on that I would be able to help
Senate and that a deal is
present the third class that
wasn't mentioned but the most
murder from second degree
murder.
Thank you Mr president Senator
that's what I thought I just
wasn't one sure want to be sure
because I and I watch a lot of
Someone who's between the age of
fourteen.
And seventeen.
Who has with premeditation.
is that correct Senator Lopez Mr
president the thing is is murder
in the first degree if you look
at the statute has three
categories including the
It and the felony murder cal
category a sell it so any of
those three categories can be
murder in the first degree so if
any of those categories felony
And all of those involved in the
in the conspiracy to commit a
felony are then convicted of the
a felony murder and also a
depraved mind murder.
Just to be crystal clear.
Thank you Mr president thank you
Sir I appreciate that
other one the felony murder
were no we're gonna do the
fifteen years Mr president I
would yield to senator o'neill
thank you thank you Mr president
by enacting this legislation so
saying state.
And offender gets forty years in
their juvenile they fit this
category well it's it's still a
forty year sentence but at the
It the phenomenon is called
staff senses so.
judges will will do like you get
ninety years and in which it
really means life without parole
eligibility for parole minus
this the side.
Thank you Mr president I guess
if you're fourteen and you got
ninety years there there might
be hope.
That
Still not be sentenced to life
imprisonment without the
possibility of release or parole
so I guess they could be
correct and that is what the
Supreme Court of of the United
States has held is required for
juveniles.
life without the possibility of
parole to release is
But we could have said life with
the possibility parole after
could we.
Because I think what you're
talking about is and I've I've
learned a lot from Senator
education.
but
Thirty years as a license.
Ms of adults all can get a
parole hearing after thirty
years whether they get paroled
would be up to the parole board.
At the hearing.
Are serving life sentences
without.
Stability parole in our state.
I do not believe that any are
inmates right now Mr president
Senator that would be affected
by this legislation and it is
very you know case by case but
there are examples of of
staff census so again it allows
for the possibility of parole
for it for individuals for
juveniles who can fit this
category once they do fifteen
old they would serve the four
years I managed my understanding
is in juvenile or would it be
seven.
Senator Lopez.
That would be up to the judge Mr
president.
that when the fifteen years
would start on the day they got
transferred and adult population
or the day they got put in at
fourteen under this bill it
president I appreciate that I
just wanna make sure I
understand the bill completely

that you know we we've decided
not to do the death penalty in
our state.
Deliberately done it and now
after fifteen years or let you
out and I know it's not
automatic I understand that that
they're gonna have the
And Mr president
Just want to make sure I
understand the bill correctly
but the I can't support a bill
that puts the value in life at
Thank you Mr president and of
course I certainly agree that
that all life has value and and
it's always a just a real
disaster when a young person is
I have to have to think a little
bit about a letter that I
received from someone from my
community who
before you start throwing rocks
and and and tell me how horrible
that is I want to tell you about
some of the things I do within
that prison that I'm very
familiar with because I've I've
inmates.
And up some of the things that
they do in their prison they
actually build homes for habitat
for humanity.
And so they have construction
inside the prison where they
like a puzzle and it's moved and
then its reassembled and they
have built gosh probably thirty
forty homes in Hobbs so that's
one of the programs that they do
another program that they have

department will take them and
put them in another person so
that they can be the kind of
mentor and advocate
that they have learned to be in
that's done in a.
In my private prison and so when
I got this letter from from the
lady and talking about her
husband and she was sharing with
idea this bill was going to come
forward.
So we completed his GED GED with
honors completed a fifteen month
And he's built houses for
habitat for humanity so he's
been you know very active in all
of those things without ever
thinking that he would have an
opportunity for parole.
understand how horrific it is
for I don't even know what he
did but obviously to get life
without parole is to do that I
it was proper pretty significant
and I don't know what that is.
For an opportunity for parole
and I will tell you I had a
friend on the proportion Hobson
it did they don't really make
hurdles even if this bill passes
but I think for that reason with
the amendment on I'm working
with the dust I think I'm
in private prisons to to do this
kind of rehabilitation and and
change people's lives and if
this bill passes the potential
this reflects so with that I'll
continue to listen thank you
thank you Senator Kernan with
you after the debate we have
Senator Griggs followed by seven
Ingle followed by Senator to see
one side or the or the other but
you know initiations we've got
would we get to points to the
bill I guess we've got the
changes to the.
possibility of parole and the Mr
president the sponsor would
please yield for for one
question.
Senator eleven yes Mr president
I yield.
of parole in that paragraph do
we're talking about winning the
allege serious youthful offender
bill shares provided that a
child.
Who don't sentences involved in
so.
As president and sponsor.
Are we.
And if it is it just seems like
it's almost in the in the wrong
place that is you know we we
were talking about in that
Do they have the same meaning in
the law or or is that something
that we really need to address
to be sure we have correct.
anyone under the age of eighteen
so I if you read them both
together youthful offender is
somebody who's been found guilty
that label but but simply
referring to his age has under
eighteen so I think it's pretty
clear I don't think anybody
would be confused about what is
Senator o'neill if you'd like to
add as many of those yield
Mister chairman Senator yes
just you know in a real simple
is what how it's the it's very
familiar to me just reading you
know those were back when I was
doing this kind of work.
So it's it's you know it's it's
sponsoring and general Neil
because I just you know as I
read.
I want to be sure that.
You know that we are talking
about the the same thing because
we're.
out and is Senator Brandt and
and you all in the discussion
you're talking about
between fourteen and eighteen
will I will listen to a little
more debate and staff I'm just
I'm concerned about the use of
of the of the terms and I I
would hope that
thank sponsor thanks Senator
Griggs we do have further debate
with senator Ortiz you know.
Senator o'neill for their work
on this bill because.
This is a little step.
In in recognizing something that
most other countries in many
In no way does taking another
life away replace that first
life lost and in fact we when we
can rehabilitate youthful
reach out to their own families
and provide some kind of healing
going on that we all benefit
this is what.
restore them to life in the real
world.
And so I really think this is a
great step forward.
It's a smaller step than I would
have like to seen but I do
understand the political
many other places in the world
have.
That simply extending punishment
in no way restores the life that
was lost.
Centering on the chamber.
Senator Stewart.
Thank you Mr president.
With the sponsor please yield
Senator Sedillo Lopez deal yes
Mr president I yield.

that are offered and the judge

Due to all the factors that the
maturity of the child then.
If the judge concludes that they
are not amenable to treatment in
the children system then the
as adults actually don't get to
participate in the juvenile
system they are actually taken
to the adult correctional
facility and this is very
Thank you Mr president so I I
was reading through this just a
little bit and so.
you know couple things came to
mind it looks like like there's
actually a couple hurdles before
child fourteen to eighteen and
you have to commit one of these
crimes from what I understand
second degree murder assault
kidnapping aggravated battery
serious youthful offender and I
will go through all that let's
just say that it's a worse than
what we talked about including
first degree murder so first you
and if your sentence as a
juvenile your sentence of from
what I see goes to the age of
twenty one and then ceases do
you find that to be
about being a youthful offender
Mr president and senator.
Senator Lopez.
Mr president if they went
through that system they would
was sentenced to fifteen years
or more.
Thank you Mr president what what
I'm getting at is just just one
elements you have to be a
youthful offender first of all
you're all these heavy sentences
are levied against you so the
court first determines your
useful fender and then they make
a determination of amend ability
you determined or what you
stated it read more to me like
the seriousness of the offense
whether the offense was
committed with aggression
child now you did mention that.
Of the record in the previous
history of the child Mr
president the prospects for
allocate adequate protection and
any other relevant factors so.
adult sentence van we go to this
second subset of amend ability
hearing and you have and the
judges must shall look at all of
separate hearing then after it's
concluded that the the the
youthful offender is not
amenable to treatment using
those
and the court go through this
and issue the sentence after all
this they felt that the
appropriate sentence is whatever
that the issue to the youthful
middle ground there somewhere I
believe that if you commit a
crime with the and your youthful
offender and you're sentenced as
an adult I do believe Mr
president that.
crimes even if you're sentences
in adult.
But the sentence has been looked
over many times by the court up
to this point so now we're
saying.
sixteen there is the possibility
of you being out at thirty one
or thirty two for very heinous
crime and that's part of the
testimony we heard Mister
to think that there's a
possibility that that person is
sentenced as an adult could be
out by the time they're the age
of thirty or thirty one.
who is not here to answer for
that so I I appreciate the bill
and and I I see what we're
trying to go with this.
sentence and maybe that time
frame and tying it to that which
is thirty years in this state
from what I understand would be
a a more reasonable time frame
difference I just don't think
that this is a good measure of
that thank you Mr president you
do have further debate we're
gonna go to Senator Ingle then
same things I'm gonna say so
I'll I'll look for go many
further testimony on this thank
you thank you senator Senator
Stewart.
This topic is one this this bill
I support and this topic is one

mental disabilities.
There's other special education
students that are disabled in a
The state the people that we're
talking about in this bill.
Our young.
But the brain does not really
for some it's earlier it's an
average.
So what we're talking about our
young people that don't know
what they're doing.
are we talking about revenge.
And punishment are we talking
about rehabilitation.
So I believe that this bill
offenders are many of them are
just not developed as a human
being.
Some of them with fifteen years
in prison we'll learn that.
Many of them I believe Senator
Kernan mention some of the work
that they can do many of them
start getting their degrees.
about that would be eligible for
this.
I do believe that the prison
system and the parole board are
able to look at what is
sentences because they don't get
the choice they don't get that
the possibility.
So I believe this is a well
crafted Wells Fargo.
Who are often dealing with that
these are young people who have
not had a good home experiences.
I had one little boy who I
looked at my phone Hey I think
he's going to be a calorie grows
up then I did a home visit and
no discipline no fun no books no
nothing.
It was six years old and he was
a real mess already.
A pretty bad sentence already at
the age of sixteen.
They're not able to really care
So this I believe gives young
people that are going to fix
their lives a chance and that's
why supported thank you.
love is the field yes Mr
president I yield thank you very
much etcetera thymus present I'm
wondering can a judge currently.
Thank you
Mr president center I'm trying
to.
Really.
And I've seen most of that by
removing mandatory minimums.
And the army for that as well
want judicial discretion.
In a lot of bills like that.
We want to give just discretion
but the judge judges already
have the ability to do this and
it seems like we're taking their
discretion away.
I would just really love to hear
from you.
Why in some circumstances.
We are giving more judicial
discretion and then in this
something I think I
misunderstood the question.
I remember the testimony of the
of the.
Former Supreme Court justice
to for that option what what is
an option is to give a fifteen
year sentence but he cannot
order a parole hearing after
fifteen years he can say thirty
Okay
Mr president center I maybe I'm
getting conflicting information
because I did reach out to some
so is that I guess is that just
not correct Mr president that is
something completely different
to suspend alive present a
sentence is affecting the
sentence.
thank you Senator smitteez and
thank you for the question you
know it's up to the parole once
the sentence happens it's up to
the parole board you know I mean
that's that's what they do we
has shown during their time so
so it's really a and and also
each situation is different I
mean you know.
Every case is different and
ninety such individuals that are
in prison right now that fit
this category but anyway we have
an adult system in a juvenile
system so you know I know it can
initiative to to re visit the
children's code and it certainly
would love to have senator
Baucus input on that are really
always respected simple but
anyway that's a just sent to me
appropriate sentence and if I
may just Justice Boston there is
a big part of this effort and he
he realizes actors for these
hello there it's it's like they
want to have more options and I
think that's partly why retired
Supreme Court justice Boston is
so supportive of this
legislation can see on the
right there are the this bill is
doing two things is dealing with
the the fact that on its face
is unconstitutional because it
allows for the possibility of
specifies instead of just saying
oh we're this can't be a
sentence that the judge can do
it also speak give some guidance
to the judge.
Thank you Mr presence the and I
guess that's part of my concern
is we're we're giving guidance
and and some other bills I feel
like we're saying Hey we've
given too much guidance so let's
so I guess that's my my concern
is just one more specific
question about the warden on
page eight so we keep some of
the fifteen years so the
about can you talk me please
about this recommendation of the
Wharton so under this bill could
judge hand down a sentence a
life sentence and then they're
eligible for parole after
might be eligible to eligible
for parole could award and then
come in ten years later and
recommend.
Eligible for parole.
They they don't recommend to
eligibility for parole that
that's not the rule.
Mr president and and some of my
my question is not what what
to recommend it if they so
chose.
Senator Sedillo Lopez.
clarification you do have to
wait till you're asked to be
yield T. L. the Senate office
has yielded to center on L.
thank you Mr president to answer
it just you know again it's it's
hard because I know people
haven't participated in the
parole world as I have but again
for me juveniles but it's this
of any kind of parole procedure
but they would have absolutely
no ability to unilaterally you
know recommend omitted to
the facilities but there the
advice.
Thank you Jim Mr president and
senators and once you have them
in clear I'm not I'm really not
just reading it on page right
here it says youthful offender
sentenced under this shall be
entitled to parole after fifteen
years I think we've debated that
On the recommendation of the
warden.
So.
Can you please explain to me
thank you Mr president and and
thank you for that question the
way it works is the warden
implements the law
and so the word would recommend
eligible but they make the
recommendation if the individual
is eligible under the law this
process is corolla controlled by
So before fifteen years I mean
it's in order here it's not
saying and that the says I
fifteen years and at the but I
guess what I'm saying is is
could could the warden still
warden could age I just that's
what it looks like the bills
doing the warden could make a
recommendation legally say at
ten years is that correct.
Okay I Mr presence enters I I
think we're I guess stuck here
but I I just.
I don't understand why it says
that they'll and if they're
change how I how I vote I I the
would like maybe greater clarity
on that but maybe I can get with
the Sanchez offline so thank you
for the discussion.
Thank you Senate's committee.
Si no further debate Senator
Sedillo Lopez close.
Thank you Mr president.
fifteen years is a long time in
the life of a child somebody who
is under the age of eighteen for
a fifteen year over year old
And so the science has shown has
Senator Stewart has so ably
described the science is shown
that brain development is not
know that children are different
and the goals of the children's
code and the juvenile system are
purely rehabilitation.
to understand that we that we
have a different system for
adults in this instance when a
child is sentences in adult we
can I ask for a roll call vote.

thank you Mr president and thank
you members of the body thank
you senator we are moving on I'm
gonna yield to Senator Hamblen.
Thank you Mr president I just
has had an opportunity for an
education and so I can't imagine
the experience that these young
folks that this bill will help
have gone through as a protest
that this bill does is that it
gives those who were sentenced
on the felony murder those who
are children who killed no one
or had to kill their abusers
because of horrific conditions
o'neill for bringing this
forward thank you Mr president
Senator Hamblen we are moving
along on the calendar I'm gonna
yield to senator Wirth to begin
with senator Wirth I thank you
Mr president checking on Senator
Senator Wirth Senator Gallegos
were to check on your amendment
for your bill is that ready to
number eight on the calendar
that's actually your bill
senator Wirth.
Thank you Mr president I ask
unanimous consent that the
record show all action for
placing Senate bill three eighty
seven.
Mr president this bill involves
independent expenditures under
the campaign code.
And the current exemption to
if the contributor request in
writing that the contribution
not be used to fund the
independent coordinated
expenditure.
The problem that has happened is
what this bill does is just add
a second requirement this was a.
Suggested by the ethics
commission a second requirement
that the contribution not only
have over there not only be a
expenditures for to make
contributions to a candidate
campaign committee or political
committee so again this a bill I
carried in twenty nineteen that
you senator Wirth we do have a
floor amendment.
The reader to read.
Senate floor amendment number
one to Senate bill three eighty
amendment number one to Senate
bill three eighty seven.
See no objections Centerville
explained with amendment as
thank you Mr president this this
the Senate this is another I
think important piece of that we
should enact this session as we
visit the same section of Law
and this reporting requirement
period would only apply to
legislators the governor or the
other executive officers to
become a candidate for federal
office during the legislative
office while serving in the
legislature those offices this
bill does not miss member does
not prohibit that they can still
raise money.
and disclose your donors this is
modeled after of an amendment in
committee stop on a separate
bill the rules committee has
occurred and I believe passed
Any more debate on Senate floor
member number one.
Senator Moores join debate on
the amendment not after his of
friendly amendment thank you any
targeting because at and I I
will say I appreciate this
ammendment because as you as
everyone knows I'm I'm in the
because I don't want to see
somebody.
Before me with a bill that I
know has of has given money but
my question is is does is this
apply to opponents as well
Senator Lopez that directive at
the end of the sponsor yield
Senator allowed to present I
will yield and you know my
well we're up here our opponents
can go and raise all the money
they want why.
Because we we have a different
role we are elected and
empowered to do the public's
individuals who are currently in
a state office when they are
running for a federal office
Senator Sedillo Lopez Mr
president my understanding is
the the blackout period applies
wants to correct me I just
always understood it applies to
everybody I'm in a place to the
legislature does not prohibit it
does not prohibit people who are
and twiddle.
Senator doing a little deterring
according to dance and I'm I'm
fascinated by this for the
Senator Moores legislation here
is just for the record I'm
provision would apply
specifically to candidates who
are in the legislature and again
it's not a black out it's simply
And that is an interest that
applies uniquely Mr president
only two persons who are
currently serving in the
legislature.
Mr president Senator Lopez Mr
president the other question I
have is it intended that every
single contribution no matter
how small would be would be a
And and that's what's expected
so this also.
Is it intended for a two dollar
contribution to be reported.
Mr president I sell all
and fifty but we have a
different take in New Mexico.
We require reporting of any
amount of money why.
As we take a strong we take a
stronger view here.
also need to consult about
whether it would be appropriate
for me to even vote on this I
know it's appropriate for me to
debate but I'm not positive
about voting on something that
center folks Mr president no
need for the Sanchez deal but
just want to make the comment
that last year as a candidate we
did not raise money during the
Senator Brandt.
Thank you Mr president and and
hi I appreciate the answer pope
you're in office or not I've
always thought that was a weird
thing because
When you're not up here you
don't really have a conflict of
interest but I guess it's it's
and if centered Candelaria wants
to to help me brush up yet
another amendment ready week we
could get rid of that as well
because I I don't think that
it's right.
money but that's a totally
different arguments so let me
get off of that
Mr president
On this ammendment.
I Mr present center I did not
realize that we could not of.
when I so the the the the
concept is preemption.
federal campaign finance law and
limit a person's ability to
raise money for federal office
it is a it is a supremacy clause
issue.
What we do have however.
will the greatest disinfectant
is passionate.
Mr president.
Mr president center thank you
for that now remember that when
it comes to the coronavirus of
it needs to be shown I honestly
wish that we could for Bennett.
Because quite frankly I think
it's.
So it's a good idea.
office for and so I I think
there's a conflict there and
honestly if I was ever gonna run
for federal office and I will
make this announcement right now
legislature I think it if it's
not a conflict in the law.
It definitely brings up some
could potentially band that but
I think since this is what we
can do I think it's a really
good idea for us to do that to
bring some sunshine to thank you
thank you center brand we have
Senator Pirtle.
senator if you don't know this
this answer that's that's fine
but I do have a question with
regard to the per prohibition on
raising funds what is that
period that you can't raise
money as a state legislator.
Loses the bid for Congress then
transfers the funds either back
to their state race or another
state race or somebody else's
Mr president center part all I
think that's a good question I I
don't know that I necessarily
have the answer for you right
now but but I think that's it I.
And thank you Mr president and I
would too and in fact I was
running for Congress I would
raise a dime until the
probationary period ended
because I don't think that's
will kill the virus whenever the
state opens back up in my son
can play baseball
I'm really looking forward to
that so I appreciate that
question and then it's probably
gonna lie in with what the
intent was or what the purpose
of raising the funds was so
thank you Mr president thank you
senator pirtle I know that
Senator Steinborn followed by
Center Morris for second time
then Senator the all of us for a
second time on the amendment
Senator Steinborn Mr president I
I don't have anything on the
of the whispers I really didn't
talk because I thought this
would be a short term short
debate but I think it's a poor
for the body to realize that
state ban on on on the on this
issue were US than Carson Pierce
was able to transfer his federal
campaign accounts to his state
race.
could announce for Congress and
raise money for disclosure I've
had people number calls trying
to recruit me to run for the CD
one race of toll on not even
could say were announced for
Congress and then raise money.
Solicit the same lobbyists were
out hitting us up for money
right now which would be huge
that the this this can happen
every single one of us could
amounts we're gonna run for
Congress every one of us could
raise money while we're here
creating a huge ethical dilemma
that our laws are supposed to be
into our Legislative Council if
we do not pass this.
moment we are open ourselves up
to a very unseemly on ethical
situation thank you Mr
president.
agree that it is
That the transparency that what
what Senator Candelaria is
asking for transparency does a
That is correct technically that
that could be done somebody
could say they're running for
Congress.
But it's would still violate our
ethics code to
ethics code so I really like the
transparency I did want to
clarify what the intent of the
bill which is which is why I ask
of people of which I am one it
is not technically a conflict so
I am happy to support the
amendment and thank the senator
for ring for bringing it.
