At many lie here members.
Thank you very much Gabby
alright I've members let me just
tell you what we're doing and
let Representative bring present
so the only question before us
is not on the merits of the bill
but on whether it is germane
related to the proclamation from
the governor which are Gabby has
emailed all of you the one
wrinkle to this is is that
you're not too old to learn
something so Representative
remain I when I looked at his
initial house bill four which is
the bill will be talking about
we can work together to see if
we could try to make it in my
judgment germane but that it's
up to the committee and
Representative remain I worked
on it and then realized that the
rules committee can't do that we
can't do an amendment or
substitution so in the interest
of trying to cut through the
process and rather have
Representative a ring go back
introduced a new piece of
legislation eat I think and I'll
let him talk that he would
propose to do a committee
substitute for whatever
committee would be assigned to
this bill most likely Judiciary
and that that's the bill we
would be looking at it's the
point two version it's two two
one zero six seven point two and
it's in your share file and so
we would be looking at that
version to see if it is germane
or not and making a
recommendation to the house
floor and with that are
committee members I will turn
over Representative Rehm.
Thank you Mr chairman
and I appreciate your help
yesterday of the this is the New
Mexico safe roads plant are.
What we have a problem here in
New Mexico is
About twenty seventeen twenty
eighteen there was the
Burchfield versus North Dakota
decision this is a US Supreme
Court to so decision.
That stated if a
DWI driver even consent to a
blood test that the blood test
must be taken pursuant to a
search warrant.
The search warrant for New
Mexico is only allowed in felony
DWI eyes and beer court homicide
cases so D. W. I. first second
and third offenses.
The officer can not obtain a
search warrant for what the
court decided that the take you
know what was intrusive to the
body and that's why they are
separate search warrants
require.
The law enforcement currently is
using what product search
warrants.
For the fillings are this case
was then
reaffirmed in New Mexico in the
state of New Mexico versus
Vargas.
So if we look at our it and
that's one of the issues in here
and all explain in a moment
there's actually three
components this bill.
If we look at our.
Scientific lab so in New Mexico
when blood sample sort it
couldn't for a DWI they are sent
to the art of Health scientific
lab in Albuquerque.
And so their data this is twenty
eighteen you know that would be
the last that they have.
That.
Ninety percent of the blood
test.
One specimens tested.
Positive for drugs
they also noted in the
governor's
And the governor's
highway safety.
Administration report that of
forty three percent of drivers
tested positive for one of more
drugs other than alcohol and
thirty seven point nine percent
tested positive for alcohol.
There's a high overlap with
drugs and alcohol with forty
point seven percent of drug
positive drivers also tested
positive for alcohol
Representative Rehm let me
interrupt you the second
remember and we're not gonna do
public comment we're not talking
about the merits of the bill the
only question is is whether is
germane to the governor's
proclamation that's the
recommendation that we're making
so I just want to remind you of
that as you're describing the
entire to the bill what the
committee is going to be
deciding is whether to make a
recommendation of the house as
to whether this is germane or so
you don't have to limit your
comments to that but it might be
helpful what the committee know
why you believe it's germane.
Okay and our Mr speaker I mean
Mr chairman
what we've done is we've
removed any reference to alcohol
other than cleanup language
that's in this bill.
So we're focusing on marijuana
one component is the blood test
which I just described another
section deals with
nanograms of marijuana
Colorado Washington state and
Oregon use five nanograms
Arizona uses zero and then the
third section is video
testimony.
Why the scientific lab since
Albuquerque is the only place
that they yes we either have a
choice to build labs all across
the state or loud video
testimony.
Currently
District Court is stewing bench
trial steps not a jury trial and
motions of by video.
And the anyway I think that we
have focused where it is dealing
with the marijuana.
In those three aspects and
with that I'd stand for
questions.
So we're not going to the
audience
so the question is is are there
questions or comments from
committee members and a
discussion I don't see any hands
up what is the will of the
committee.
The motion by the way would
either be in the form of we
recommend to the body I'm sorry
Representative divert I see I
see I've I've Representative
Nibert your hand went up first
I'll call on you.
Thank you.
Representative Nibert you still
there.
You are muted Representative
there you go.
Now you show me the okay.
You hear me now yes.
I'm sorry.
The.
Germano seems to me that if it
has to be related to one of the
two
Tax Court wanted to subject
matters that are set forth in a
proclamation that being.
The other cannabis bill that we
just passed out of the house for
the are we to build obviously
this opportunity to lead a so
the question is does does this
bill.
Pertain to an aspect of of
cannabis and and if I recall
there were provisions in the
bill that we just passed that
dealt with the ability of a of
an officer to
Stopped there and that they
could be of.
I guess subject to criminal
penalties for driving.
under the influence of.
Cannabis terms so it seems to me
that if this is the only way
maybe not the only way but that
this would be the substantial
why are proving.
that they are.
Intoxicated it would be
it would seem to me to be
germane to the bill that we just
passed
so I I I I think it it cuts the
mustard there thank you Mr chair
Representative Chasey.
Thank you Mr chairman and
I appreciate this opportunity I
just want to say to
Representative readers when we
turn on the screen.
The judiciary analyst has looked
at the bill and out one of the
comments that
This is a little bit more about
the merits and Germanus but I
just wanted to let you know kind
of where my thinking is the
science is evolving on the
percentages and how to apply
those and what actually is is
standard for inhabitants and
What.
I realize is that before this
all actually this engine gets
moving down the tracks there's
time.
For us to really look at the
science and we'll get it right
before we actually would need to
implement and we have another
session coming up and I think
this would be a ideal time to do
that so that's All I Want J. Mr
chairman Representative Maestas.
Thank you Mr chairman reserving
just just real quick on trying
to.
Trying to get were.
With the gentleman from Chavis
is going up or got their rather
but so just.
Just to reiterate no article
four section six you know
special session the legislature
may be called by the governor
but no business shall be
transacted except such as
relates to the objects specified
in this proclamation.
And so I'm looking at the
proclamation I think.
I don't see a window but there
is a tiny window and it talks
about.
Drug related policies in a
manner substantially similar to
that proposed by house bill
twelve.
Introduced you know in the first
session what what sections of
this bill are similar to the
ones in house bill twelve I
don't believe the device section
was included in house bill well.
Mr Chairman representative ring
you.
Mr chair and representative.
When we go to house bill twelve
or two that we saw earlier.
We saw the discussion about
DWI I I don't have that bill in
front of me so I can't
take you right to it but the
odor of marijuana
could be used as the reasonable
suspicion to to work on
a DWI arrests.
Thank you for that Mr Chairman
was every I think of.
I recall that section from the
bill
the D. W. I. sections very
familiar to us as this must be a
gradual as every session and
it's I don't know how many pages
it is these days about five or
six.
But the database section wasn't
in.
House Bill to all of its not in
house bill two.
So I just I think it's novel
efforts and and something to
contemplate the policy
provisions but we're not here to
discuss that I just don't see
how it's streaming on on
Instagram thank thank you Mr.
Presenter Montoya.
Thank you Mr chairman
it is a Representative Martinez
on on this
because I'm wondering why I
believe.
That that in the the bill we.
Allocated money for training for
police and I believe it was
I believe leader Stapleton in
that discussion was for the
purpose of.
Well for for.
Dealing with the why and how to
that was that was discussion
during the the bill I think it
was seven hundred fifty thousand
dollars if my memory serves.
that for training of.
Please as a matter of fact I I
think Representative Townsend
was the one who is engaging and
that a lot of discussion with
leaders Stapleton and that that
to was going to be training for
all police officers across the
state
in dealing with the D. Y.
potentially you are a so
we've already introduced
something that if if this is not
germane and that is not germane.
in the feet bill.
So that's those are my comments
thank you Mr chairman of before
I take a motion bowl Mr someone
else yeah we I'm sorry
Representative Romero.
Thank you Mr chairman I was just
hoping to respond to to
Representative Montoya when he
brings up on the feed bill so
looking at the proclamation it
talks about appropriation any
necessary appropriations
but so when we're dealing with
the feasibility appropriation to
law enforcement for such matters
I think it's the appropriation
part that's pertinent to the
proclamation where is the
substance of house bill four
it's not so I just want to
clarify as to why I think that
this is outside the scope of the
proclamation
especially as it pertains to
Representative Montoya is
comments thank you Mr chairman
Mr chairman then more respond R.
Representative among children.
Yes so the one of the arguments
that we had about the fee bill
was that that was not germane
that was something that that.
Russian of the State bill first
option and then if you go but
but since it was included in the
bill and it was specifically
mentioned that law enforcement
could would use that for
training and discussion about
what training it was it was
going to be with interaction
concerning D. W. Y. so my point
is we've already by essence of
our actions have dean that
germane on this topic so thank
you Mr arching over the
discussion right let me just say
to the members the committee
just so we're clear
Representative Rehm has
represented to us that she would
be willing to
our legislative committee
substitute to whatever committee
is going to be discussing this
bill the merits of the bill
that's shared file the point two
version and comparing it to a
proclamation that's what we're
doing to determine Germanus so
the question on the table is
whether we recommend to the body
to consider this bill germane
and therefore be part of the
committee assignments to a
standing committee and with that
I will take a motion one way or
the other.
Mr chairman I would that we
the chairman of the bills the.
All right so the bills are
second second that all rights
are so as a motion by
Representative nine in the
second by Representative.
The question on the table as
that the bill be considered
germane of border and last are
recommending to the body that'd
be considered.
Hello anybody here we are I.
Yes I voted yes and we will be
recommending to the body that
the version that Representative
we have suggested when we
presented as either a committee
substitute our amendment is
germane to the governor's
proclamation in a vote of no and
we will not be recommending it
the clerk to call the roll.
Representative Chasey widget
shell.
Representative Cook.
Representative Cook.
Figure it all.
Representative Fajardo.
Yes.

in the affirmative and eight min
negative.
So the recommendation and to the
body will not be to recommend
that it is germane thank you
members the committee we stand
adjourned.
Thank you Gabby.
