Thank all those bills may.
The I just have the house house

amendments to house bill forty
three as amended.
Next read IT to the gentleman
from Chavis and Lincoln on.
Us to forty four.
Thank you Mr speaker the Senate
rules committee made several
changes to house bill two forty
four the gist of it is with
respect to Senator
Activities I strongly agree
Attorney General and the
district attorney
representations of the bill and
then beginning in section five
they cleaned up the language
because the bill is being a past
this year it's destructive the
old provisions in the original
well law that required this
legislature to pick up and and
review what was done with the
ethics bill originally we
obviously haven't done that in
this bill so that language does
not need to appear and with that
Mr speaker I stand for questions
I would recommend the body
except the Senate amendments
okay is there debate on the
Senate amendments to house bill
two three four is that it.
Mr speaker you general chat is
the end result.
Thank you Mr speaker I had a
quick question it will the
Representative yield.
Mr speaker right the
representative from Chavis and
Lincoln will yield to the
Representative from Travis
Roosevelt and leave.
Thank you gentleman gentleman
what I heard you say that the
Senate amendments.
The Attorney General and
district attorneys if if I
understood your comment
correctly
I was I was curious why the
Senate would want to remove of
those two up a lack it
Of.
Officials from the ethics
process question.
Mr speaker and gentleman the
mission of the Attorney General
the district attorney is with
respect to items that are.
Investigated and have civil
sanctions not criminal sanctions
so the state ethics commission
and the secretary of state are
the only bodies that will pursue
those Senator.
Issues and they are not related
to criminal issues that would
rise to the district attorney or
Attorney General
Offices for for enforcing.
Thank thank you for that and and
the Senate amendments did not
affect the affected date of us
house bill two forty four is
that correct.
Mr speaker let me look at the
effective date I do not recall
screen Mr speaker and gentleman
that anything dealt with that
issue member center.
No Sir
The Senate rules committee all I
did was change the number the
section with respect to the
effective date of the not change
effective Mr speaker and gentle.
Thank you very much for that
response Representative and
you've answered my questions Mr

a couple of amendments to house
bill forty seven made on the
Senate floor which were friendly
amendments and I are urged the
body to concur.
Gentlelady to explain the
minutes thank you Mr speaker of
the first seven amendments are
removed some clauses that
senators thought were
unnecessary and we agreed that
those were de minimus and of no
practical concerns the second to
set of amendments was to
On the short title allow this
bill to be referred to as either
Elizabeth white field end of
life options act or simply the
end of life options act on there
by not necessitating Elizabeth
white field to be
stated every single time and
with that I stand for questions
caters to many generations has
NO terror yes Mr speaker would
ask for a roll call vote.
Yes I will call the strike.
The gentleman San Juan
Representative Montoya.
Thank you Mr speaker this
generated really able.
Mr speaker I'd gladly yield to
the gentleman from San Juan.
Thank you Mr speaker.
I am the if I can have you refer
to the amendment from the Senate
to to number two two zero eight
five zero point one who.
I've been trying to read this.
in context and I don't have my
computer set up in front of me
what is the practical nature of
this ammendment.
gentlelady.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
It removes.
Of the section on the death
certificate needing to say the
underlying condition.
and it removes the section on
affect on wheels and contracts
and our remove this
the provision on it not to.
being evidence of neglect or
removes the civil liabilities
but
C. and and.
I think that's
I think that's it think of
captions on but we are still in
the bill is a provision that
That nothing that actions taken
in accordance with the act shall
not be construed for any purpose
to constitute suicide which was
the general purpose of outlining
the death certificate and wills
and contracts to be clear that
it wasn't suicide that would
impact those so we think it
doesn't have a significant
change.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady so how.
How with this from the
standpoint of.
Angel suicide now with that
language that's been removed.
How that interact with set a
insurance policy then that Mr
speaker generally.
I'm.
Mr speaker and gentleman I don't
believe that insurance policies
can it can change their policies
their budget based on.
On whether this is in existence
and I think that if there's any
question we can do our
regulation through the offices
superintendent of insurance
have regulation or guidance that
they cannot change policies just
because of the existence of
this.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
for answering my question
generally.

Gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln for what purpose do
rise.
Thank you Mr speaker I rise in
comment on on the rule I do not
object to the fact that thank
you for we're doing that but I
really think that part of the
work of these two bodies are
trying to work in concert with
one another and and I think that
there are preventing us from
getting all of their floor
that's certainly not made the
our work any easier and so I I
appreciate your taking this
action but I really hope that
maybe over the interim that
maybe you and the leaders over
the Senate work it out where
they realized the work that
we're engaged and needs more
cooperation not less so thank
you Mr speaker for ordering them
thank you for crossing the
street thank you John.

Thank you
Chairman Jennifer early I have a
few questions just wanna talk.
A little bit about this bill.
the I guess the.
The first question I asked
speaker and gentleman.
You mentioned the total.
dollar amount of this bill is.
Five hundred seventy one million
tonight thank you at correctly.
Mr speaker and gentleman it's
five hundred seventy two
million.
Awesome
thank you our.
Mr speaker and gentleman and
this is obviously our capital
outlay bill that we do
Well usually every year not
always every year which had a
couple without capital outlay.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
It was last year we had a decent
amount of.
Well wait available but that was
also supplemented with general
fund money speaker John Murray
rendering that right that was
last year right.
Mr speaker and gentleman that is
correct.
Speaker and gentleman what what
ended up happening was I know
everyone who was here last year
members.
during the the special session
budget crisis actually before
that the session ended and ready
having issues
the governor and one item
between all of the general fund
appropriations for capital
outlay and so a lot of the
products and funded and I'm not
being funded.
Mr chairman and I understand
that that moves in a budget
crisis you.
You attach the nonessential
the Economic dedicated already
so.
Understand that move the Mr
chairman.
In this particular bill are
there general fund
appropriations as part of the
members capital outlay dollars.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman there is roughly
eighteen point six or to be
exact eighteen point six million
dollars in general fund but none
of it is is allocated to member
allocations I believe a good
chunk of that are are for tribal
projects.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman that that that is
really good this year
that is what I know last year
when we allocate our dollars we
didn't.
But we wouldn't put our sheets
which was capital outlay which
was general fund so just kind of
surprised each member which
projects for review told.
so it's nice to know that if
there are details in projects
this year it's a it's a not due
to a general fund verses capital
outlay dollars it's a no just
the governor's progress on what
projects she she feels should be
featured.
Mr Chairman
I will ask you a few questions
about the other parts of this
bill because I think it's
important for members to know
we're not just talking about our
capital outlay sheer in this
bill this isn't just the house
members and Senate members
capital outlay requests there's
a lot of other things going on
this bill some things are really
important to some things I think
are less important maybe a
little waste of money
Mr speaker job and
Can you.
You tell me just we're just so
our new members are aware.
Where to the capital outlay
dollars come from you understand
we're general fund dollars come
from where the capital outlay
fund dollars contrast.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman and ask questions
capital dollars that come from
severance tax bonds are bonds
that we sell based on an
estimate of what the state will
be receiving from severance
taxes oil gas other minerals and
or provide economist LFC DFA get
together every year as a new
other revenue consensus uh
estimate group which also
includes taxed read as you know
I'll come up with these numbers
and they can look out ten years
in the Ryzen I'm in that.
These numbers that we use every
year to to help inform our
capital outlay allocation
decisions
as the beginning.
We have
we have five hundred seventeen
million total about four hundred
seventy seven million come out
of those severance tax bonds
and and that's where the bulk of
our allocations house Senate the
governor gets a third of that as
well come from.
Also Mr speaker and gentleman
that that's a great explanation
and and all maybe just dial it
in just a little bit more so are
severance tax taxes are
obviously taxes that come from
severing resources from public
lands right so you're you're
extractive industries mining oil
and gas those things when we
extract those from the ground
there's.
A tax that's the severance tax
that's a district to a many
other taxed.
What we do is we project how
much service tax money we're
gonna get in the year.
And then we will issue a set of
bonds are based off of that
revenue will pledge the the
funding of those bonds to that
revenue.
and that's how we're able to
actually fund
much more eight dollars in
projects and might actually do
it in dollars in a year for
severance tax.
and of course not all of this
goes to our capital outlay
projects there's there's a pie
this year marks that part.
Speaker John and and I believe
the biggest your mark is to.
Actually result of the SUNY
lawsuit just to the public
school capital outlay do you
remember what percent of that
pie goes to
the.
R. K. to twelfth capital outlay
projects every year I I I I do
not Mr speaker German but I you
probably do so what are you.
Yeah.
Mr chairman I have.
I don't remember the exact
number it's either forty five
percent or fifty five percent is
a huge number.
And and and what will you what
what you explained was speaking
on all all pin it down for us.
Yes thank you so so I I just
want members to understand
because this is important right
when you look at every single
one of our districts and every
school across the state.
Our public school capital outlay
authority
actually rigs the schools
there needs to district needs
and then they'll take this
capacity that we get every year
and all fund the ones with the
greatest needs numbers go down
the list and so that's how we
are able to show any of that
Zuni lawsuit.
Mr Chairman were we able to
provide that.
It's coming okay so you're
looking at something that.
So so that takes off but we have
to dollars.
And then of the rest there are
also some your marks
the speaker and gentleman
of that.
leftover sort of percent with
percent so are leftovers ten
percent goes to water projects
yep of that ten percent one
percent goes to the engineer.
four point five percent goes to
Kronos projects four point five
percent goes to tribal
construction projects and then
the rest.
Is what
the governor and the legislature
divide up
and they're not just also that
there is a stop according to
statute about twelve percent of
the total it's supposed to go to
the severance tax permanent for.
and that doesn't always happen
respond bonding there's other
stuff we're not going to board
the the the members with
information but it's important
to note that.
Very small percent of this pipe
assistance tax permanent fund
which is why it is not grown
like State Land Grant permanent
finance and white
but it's in trouble
for many years reporter what on
the market to keep alive.
so just what members to be aware
that
when this started back in the
sixties actually fifty percent
of the money went to the
permanent fund.
Over the over the years we've
been slowly whittling that down
and spending more spending more
instead of help.
Speaker and gentleman were you
successful if not that's okay.
it's it's on its way I could see
the little dots on my phone
okay.
In the wake Mr chairman I should
I should add my experts are
Mister Steve you'll send and his
name that the whole from LFC
also.
Thank you okay so Mr leader
gentleman now we know all this
money comes from just a couple
questions about Tapley portion
then we'll talk about the other
parts of the building I don't
think what's members understand
I think support.
So we have this this group of
dollars this pie that
Is there left to the the
governor the legislature to
decide how to apportion.
And
Typically speaker John and what
you mentioned what we do is we
split a service servicer Sir for
the governor search for the
houses are from Senate.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
that's not a hard and fast
agreement
Mr chairman I refer I recall
hearing about
our governor to governor's ago
and what she would do is you
would take half of that money
for statewide projects and then
the other half use for the third
for hello Sir from Senator from
house so the house the Senate
and Representative getting less
than twenty five percent of what
was available Mr John if you
talk just a little bit about
that process and then the good
works that
the legislature did working
relation with the governor and
how we came to the current of
break up break down that we
have.
You're you're gonna John.
Course it would not be as the
meeting without somebody being
muted.
Thank you for the question and
that is you know the practices
and and you know I don't think
it's it's written anywhere in
stone but I think the practice
the last several years has been
for the LFC along with DFA and
those executive agencies over
the course of the year to put
together a list of statewide
priorities that gets vetted
through the LESC process and and
is voted in
as part of the LFC frame of the
December every year
that
that statewide list
consist of higher ed it you know
cultural affairs Environment
Department you name it and they
can include a variety of
projects
the the leftover money is what
is divided in thirds between how
CENIC governor in the
negotiation as you know Mr
speaker and and and and
gentlemen is is
You know it's it is what it is
you know it's a it's a labor of
love really and and god bless
our staffers who have to be
there and sort of follow the
numbers and whatnot
The questions is sure a little
bit more difficult because we
can be in person obviously so
you can imagine a whole lot of
phone calls to individuals over
the last you know fifty days or
so
but you know we were able to
land in a place where I think
you know we maximized as it is a
chamber of the maximize we were
able to deliver to each of our
members all of you included
just so that you can appropriate
those funds to your specific
communities
Mr speaker administrative data
you know while we're on this
topic
approximately two hundred eleven
million dollars are part of that
statewide for the work that was
negotiated between executive
agencies and the LESC over the
course of the interim
there and then the the remaining
two hundred and seventy six
million is what's divided in
thirds right so that gives each
house member roughly one point
three million dollars on each
Senator a little bit more
because there are less of them
and then that last remaining
cared for the governor
and and just also just to to to
pick back up something you said
earlier Mr speaker and gentleman
I will talk about those those
three pure marks
I believe restrictor Fund comes
in at twenty six point six
million this year same with
Cologne S. infrastructure fund
and then approximately fifty
three million for water
projects.
Thank you John and that's super
help.
and I and I think that's about
the average I remember right
when you're looking at some
capital outlay reform is roughly
twenty five million of those
projects for the cronyism and
the tribal god every year.
and Mr chairman before we we
leave this area I'm just so I
especially our new members are
aware.
we do get a lot of criticism
that our capital outlay projects
that we've
funded that they don't get spend
down right away and there's a
huge backlog I think it's close
to a billion dollars of capital
we dollars that have not been
spent down yet.
Legislators especially that it
called for this Mr Chairman
the other year marks also have
the same situation tribal record
yes the water even the.
Capital outlay public school
funds thank they're not able to
spend these down immediately
they all have large balances.
Speaker John and and do you do
you happen to have handy the the
total balance or the balances in
those different funds at this
time.
Speaker and gentleman there's
roughly a one point four billion
dollar backlog.
Mr speaker and gentleman I yeah
and and I get it we want that
money to go immediately you know
I'm I'm no I've been here for
nine years Mr speaker and
gentleman I know you've been
here for seven I'm sure some
projects that you funded that
you like okay you told me your
shovel ready and it's been three
years what what's going on so I
I just want to let members know
that we will continue to be
subject to that
criticism and folks wanting to
change how happily runs until we
do a better job of making sure
those funds get out the door and
Mr Chairman I just encourage all
the members to actually called
LFC anytime.
And they will send you a list of
your projects what you should do
is you should go down that list
and call the Sanchez can stay
where we are.
And and get that money moves.
And if it's not moving every
year there is a capital outlay
reauthorization already passed
out of house whatever your is a
reauthorization and as the
sponsor of that project you can
work with the other state funded
you can re appropriate that
funding somewhere else.
for for example are we ready for
school district they do a great
job as our projects they
actually came in under on
several projects so we had a
balance on a few of our projects
are done and so this year during
the re authorization process we
struck that money and put it in
there too current assets
Representative our schools into
asked real to put that money
into those to us we didn't have
to use any of our twenty from
this year for those two
projects.
so I just want to you know
encourage members to please.
I understand that once this has
been assigned one is not not
done you really have to shepherd
watch these projects to make
sure they have the they get done
quickly.
Okay Mister speaker and
gentleman so let's.
I want to finish off was just
talking about the other parts of
this bill
that folks might not be aware of
can you can you I mean I see
some things here but maybe
gentleman issues want to mention
some of things that you know
other things are happening in
this bill that are not just
member capital outlay.
Yes the the speaker and and
gentlemen that there's a list of
of very very good tribal
projects at the executive put
together a lot of these deal
with water infrastructure are
there a few out a Navajo Nation
for example that the that were
identified.
like I said earlier when you
look at the statewide framework
there's a lot of good work
happening throughout state
government you know there's some
pretty.
The strong pretty heavy public
safety investments in in
corrections you know a lot of
those facilities are pretty
outdated and so there there have
been some they're gonna be some
pretty good improvements after
and then you know broadband I
mean broadband we we've got
roughly I believe ten million in
here for broadband.
which is a drop in the bucket I
mean I think there's there's
really a lot more money that's
coming through to other sources
to other legislation
but you know I think your points
are very well taken you know I I
do want to also echo your
sentiments with regard twenty
members and and staying on top
of these appropriations
you know I for for small rural
communities but even for urban
centers like like mine you know
often times you've got to stay
on it get a state on top of it
so that the money is expended in
the way that it's supposed to be
able to properly on time
the last thing I'll say about
that is because Germany is you
know the pandemic I think really
sort of created some
Yes
issues I think with getting
projects out especially at the
beginning when this thing was so
on non I'm I feel like now
things are picking back up again
but for a little while there you
know between March of last year
and you know the end of the
summer you know things are
pretty pretty scary for a lot of
people and so I think a lot of
places kind of stopped there
their work but hopefully it's on
the up and up now.
Yeah Mr speaker John I I I I
agree with that
And I'm I'm just going to
highlight a couple things that
are in here or not capital
outlay member related I'll have
a couple questions if you don't
know the answers that's.
That's fine I'm just really
curious want to bring this
potential folks so it looks like
we have
twelve point five million
dollars for local economic
development actually to
projects.
The speaker John this is this is
not uncommon we will often put
some cap what we dollars to Lita
I'm guessing that's probably
from the governor share.
Mr John and you know what our
current need to fund balances I
know we in the past we try to
keep a close to fifty million or
seventy five million you know
it's Adam where this twelve
point five million would take
it.
Mr speaker and gentleman let me
consult with the act.
Thanks.
Mr speaker John and we're we're
not too big for that number for
you.
Okay that's that's fine yes when
you have it I yeah I sent a text
that I just preaching on thank
you another item on here that
I've been following for a while
is the how much water rights
settlement.
I think.
The state was responsible for
something like.
Eighty million dollar I can't
remember was a huge number
that the state had to
find is a match to the feds for
this and that our water rights
settlement and it looks like
this year we're putting nine
million dollars which are fun do
you know where we're at on on
reaching that that amount that
New Mexico is required to to
find.
One second just thank you.
There is for the debate the
gentle lady from Chavis
Representative result.
Mr speaker I'm sorry I was
consulting with my experts I I
know general just give you a
preview of what's coming up.
Okay.
Speaker gentle man
it's about a hundred and four
million dollars that was eight
the the state obligation comes
out two hundred four million
dollars and there are fifty one
million dollars remaining on
that obligation after the nine
million that are in here you go
down forty two.
Also thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman I I I appreciate you
taking at the time to provide
that answer and I think that is.
I'm hoping that we reached that
deadline it looks like if we do
kind of ten million dollars a
year we have four more years in
addition this when I get there
so that's an important thing to
get done Mr chairman I guess the
last thing I'll just mention
the.
you did mention broadband and
the speaker John it looks like
we've got seven million dollars
for.
Broadband going through this
this bill that I get that right.
Your muted again sorry.
I'm speaking so there there's
five million broadband use up to
three million that the governor
added shared as well and then
there's I that is part of a
tribal.
It's been an broadband.
Thank you.
Gentleman.
Yeah.
I guess the point I just want to
make and then all all all yield
I understand that
we have service connectivity
issues for cell phone internet
across the state or federal
state
even a Rancho we have issues
And.
I really seem so that.
By investing all this money to
broadband right now.
We're we're actually
We're actually making accord
best.
Mr chairman I think you've heard
me talk about this before but
actually this just this week
it's almost once a week SpaceX
launched another starlink
satellite or a rocket up put
sixty satellites up every every
lodges sixty satellites they now
have over fourteen hundred in
orbit.
And
this is this incredible game
changer and save their beta
testing this.
Satellite internet service right
now and folks are getting
As good as a status table and in
some cases better speeds than
cable internet.
And it's it's a hundred Bucks a
month.
and Google must is planning to
put about forty two thousand
satellites up cover the entire
world.
And when that happens it's not
just give the global internet is
also talking about cell phone
service to.
and he's talking about this
being fully functional in the US
towards the end of this year.
so I really think.
Half of us will have our
internet through starlink and
SpaceX in the next couple years
we will still need broadband to
connect cell towers.
and and kind of as the backbone
for.
You know getting information
around but
I don't think spending all this
money on broadband yes the last
mile making a huge effort robin
right now would be like
Us.
As cell phone towers and cell
phones are coming online us to
making huge investment on land
line
phones this is Mr chairman I
just as one of the sure that
and the and I know you're you're
still waiting for internet
satellite is that right chairman
John.
Hey I'm I'm waiting anxiously my
connection is not very good
something.
Awesome well thank you John and
I I I appreciate you sharing
this bill and give me the time
to help explain some of this to
the members Mr speaker I your
thank you Jim.
Thank you there is for the
debate the gentleman from Chavis
Representative Ezzell.
Mr speaker do you want to warm
the name again.
No.
That's a wise move on your part
Mr speaker Mr speaker will the
gentleman from Bernalillo yield.
A state you.
Okay.
Mr speaker and gentleman I have
gone down street counties and
that at first I started.
With this particular document
right here I don't know if you
can see what I'm holding get the
stoplight document and it's a
page one of twenty seven and
then I started going through the
whole bill itself to look at
different projects for different
areas of the state is is very
enlightening what I'm reading
here whenever I did break down
all to counties and but all they
were.
Asking for what all they were
granted but I do have a question
for you Mr speaker and
gentleman.
On page twenty six for.
Let me see it yet on the flight
copy do you have the white copy
or do you have a great.
Mr speaker.
Speaker gentle lady I believe I
have the white one that you're
holding.
Mr speaker of what we're talking
about the statewide projects I
do have some questions there
would you be and able to answer
those questions for me Mister
speaker.
Mr speaker gentle lady I can try
my best absolutely.
Okay well that's refreshing to
hear under the statewide
projects and we're going to
continue on to page twenty five
item number four one nine three
four four four nine am four one
nine two.
Can you expound on those little
bit one the first one four one
nine three is talking about
school bus cameras four four
four nine talks about school bus
replacement P. M. T..
Yes yes.
In four one nine two school
buses replace can you tell me
what that is in regard to
please.
Yes **** I one second it's.
I'm speaking to a lady so item
forty one million three school
bus cameras that's a it was a
safety request and it's it's for
all district of school buses
District on school buses off
four four nine four nine two
there's a federal law Mr speaker
gentle lady that
that mandates that buses be
replaced every twelve years
there's about roughly six to
seven million dollar state share
this year and so the way it's
listed on the bill the expense
has been split through two
different funds so there's the
Volkswagen settlement fund which
was part of a lawsuit.
And Volkswagen
a few years ago and then the
other one I believe is the
public school capital outlay.
Okay Mister speaker gentleman
thank you for that information
and I'm assuming when we're
talking about the school bus
cameras and school bus
replacements and both items here
this is for statewide is that
correct Mr speaker and
gentleman.
With speaker gentle lady that's
correct.
Okay I appreciate that response
my next question is goes.
Mr speaker gentleman on page
twenty four of the bill on item
number four one zero seeks is
later projects statewide do you
happen to have a break down of
those particular projects.
Mr jelly R. one second.
Speaker gentle lady we we don't
have a list
is Max for so eloquently stated
a lot of these projects are in
the pipeline and and perhaps or
not but public yet of course
everything is is done in
accordance to the to the the
statute so you know everything
is is is clean and clear but you
know that was a request that
came in from the agencies to
help support that program based
on what's in the pipeline.
Okay well I was just curious as
to what some of those projects
might be and what areas of the
state they're going to benefit
Mr speaker one other item that
has I just need to know which is
item number four to one seven
the Indian Water Rights Madam
can you tell me which project
that is actually paid for.
Certainly distribution would
give us a second.
Let the settlements are actually
with a clip of some of the
northern pueblos C. putting the
of Lebanon may end up walking
and several others on and it's
part of what a the Germans and
will never talk about our here
the one hundred four million
dollars settlement of which we
still have fifty one million
dollars to pay and after these
nine million dollars going we'll
go down to the forty two
million.
Okay thank you for that Mr Mr
speaker and gentleman.
Gentleman on item number four
two one eight this is damn re
have statewide in that total is
well tell me a is this through
the office of the state engineer
or the.
Interstate Stream Commission or
is it some other entity that
were at securing this money for
for damn Marie have.
Thank you Mr thank you Mr
Kennedy this is a you said the
number was four two one eight
then we have statewide.
speculated that five million
dollars.
We're we're the general manager
anybody please watch your
language.
Mr speaker.
We're trying to rehabilitate of
chi.
Yes I do want to know about dam
rehabilitation okay.
Respectability the darn.
We have statewide is to the
office of the state engineer.
Okay so Mister speaker this is
coming in on top of what is
budget already is that correct.
Yes that is correct Mr speaker
generally.
Okay and the.
Mr speaker one thing that's
really got my curiosity up is
item number four four five six
alright and public safety rope
up purchase fill me in about
that please.
One secondly.
Speaker.
Speaker JD it is a bomb squad
robot.
I didn't get to see.
The prototype but it's it's for
bomb squad.
Mr speaker and gentleman that
brings me to why I was asking
about that of.
Every year during this year yes
here we did not have the eastern
New Mexico state fair.
But there was the alien city
showdown.
And there was.
Contributions made to the young
exhibitor.
From lots of people that are
sitting in this body.
And the.
Thank you he sent me a picture
and a jar of hot sauce but it
came in a box.
And it was sitting out on one of
the chairs in the front lobby
and that has whenever I stayed
out house I am talking about
capital north it was named out
has seventeen years ago and Mr
speaker I guess so several of
the LA's that there were
concerns because it had markings
all over it and it was actually
turned upside down so one of the
LA's very carefully Care did
outside needing the assistance
of the state police to see if it
might be something that would be
detrimental to health to the
help of all the people out
there.
The department of public safety
the state police were very
concerned about it and so they
got out their little probes and
everything and cut holes out the
box to make sure it wasn't going
to detonate on anybody so that I
thought that was kind of funny
but.
M. can you get to a box it had
dark hot sauce in the picture.
So Mister speaker whenever we're
talking about this DPS robot
purchases it looks like it's
baton just a meal she's.
We're will remove this robot.
I'm not going to say live
reside.
The plug data that will be here
in Santa Fe will be in
Albuquerque is there any
clarification there.
Mr chair lady up you know I'm
I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm
I'm assuming it would be you
know headquartered wherever
DPS headquarters probably
specialty equipment but I'm not
sure that is.
Okay thank you for that response
and then Mr speaker one more
thing I'm seeing uh can't did
not mark the number down that it
says
Charging station somewhere and I
can't seem to find that number.
But I was just wondering how
many charging stations that
entails because it was a huge
amount of money.
Number twelve eighty six is the
number on it.
This because only one second.
Later.
okay Mister speaker I guess I
didn't realize that the
governor's part of it was it
included in all of these
projects right here so I I would
I would be really curious if
you'd give me that information
later on I would appreciate it
because I'd like to how many.
I'm gonna transportation vehicle
charging stations four million
two are we going to have in our
state Mr speaker and gentleman.
In spite of last year being the
dismal failure that was as far
as businesses the enable to
operate it's really good to know
that are.
Oil and gas industry and the
agricultural state secretary
stepped up to be able to fund
these projects that are now
going to benefit all citizens of
the state of New Mexico and with
that I'd like to say we
appreciate your oil and gas and
the agricultural community very
much thank you Mr speaker.
There's further debate the
gentleman called Sliq curry hard
claims outstanding L. and you.
Thank you Mr speaker Mr speaker
my questions been answered.
The gentleman from the
Representative Pettigrew.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Does the gentleman from Burnley
in the.
Speaker I yield to Jennifer Lee.
Thank you and I'm I understand
Mister speaker part of this may
be
a repeat but I do want to ask a
question to make sure everybody
the may be listening and.
sis.
Mr speaker and gentleman what is
the severance tax money come
from.
Since severance of minerals oil
gas other minerals that are
severed and taxes.
So Mr speaker and gentleman can
you talk about the other
minerals the.
Our server.
Mr Chairman perhaps copper
estimating I'm sure to get your
lan this Madam I've.
Mr speaker is your expert
witness of that information.
Mr speaker LFC is pulling it up
right now.
Mr speaker and gentleman copper
cold I add sh those are the
ones.
For more updates.
Mr speaker and gentleman can you
give me a break down on.
the percentage with respect to
the oil and gas let's go with
minerals like copper
and then maybe potash and
aggregates there would come from
state land as well.
We speak actually we don't have
that right down
well we'd be happy to get that
to you.
Mr speaker and gentleman I
appreciate that
Mr speaker and gentleman.
According to this twenty one
million nine hundred eighty four
thousand come from other state
funds can you describe what
those other state funds are Sir.
the speaker down then I'd be
happy to some of those funds so
as I stated earlier there's the
Volkswagen settlement fund for
example
that would be one of
some of the other funds that are
that are in here if you give me
a second.
there is
so there's the public school
capital outlay fund
there's one that comes at a game
and game and fish habitat
management fund
so I think those are the
probably just three bigger ones.
Thank you Mr speaker and so as
we go through this of the five
hundred seventeen point seven.
Million dollars that.
This.
House bill two eighty five
committees of.
disperses out.
How much of that comes from the
oil and gas severance tax.
And then Mr speaker and
gentleman can you tell me how
much of that impacts directly
each and every house member.
of the seventy house members we
have.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
So as we
How it affects you transmit the
that's the that's each of your
allocations one point three.
Give or take a little bit more I
think is one million three
hundred fourteen thousand
dollars that each of you each of
us were able to appropriate
about four hundred seventy seven
million come from the severance
tax bonds
and then there's a money that
comes from general fund and then
the other state funds speaking
German I think you were asking
me what percentage of the
severance tax bonds derived from
oil and gas was at the what the
question was Mister speaker.
Specifically yes thank you for
asking for
Clarification on that
specifically of the one point
three one four million dollars
that each of the seventy members
of this house was able allocate
to their districts is specific
to oil and gas severance.
Mr speaker John then I can give
you an exact percentage but it's
the vast majority of that.
Mr speaker and gentleman what
can we can we safely say this
probably around ninety percent
by my calculations anyway I
think it's I think.
Because maybe about ninety one
ninety two
So yeah I think it think you're
about right Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman so with that and and
let's be my final point I would
actually no I have I have one
other question.
Do we have any funds.
In our capital outlay projects
that come from solar or wind.
Speaker.
Not yet perhaps in the future
with.
Mr speaker and gentleman can we
agree that west was some of the
bills that we've had come across
the the house floor and we could
set up to the to the Senate.
That was the subsidized the way
we're subsidizing the.
When the solar.
And the the route or the way
we're relaxing property taxes
and several other.
Several other initiatives that
we have that it will probably be
a decade before green energy
actually never gives anything to
a
House of representatives to turn
back and help their.
respective districts.
Mr.
That's a that's a fantastic
question and I mean that I don't
think the the answer is I don't
think any of any of us really
knows I mean I think a lot of
things are at play tax reform
gross receipts tax reform which
would hate all of these
industries are when you're
talking about subsidies or
incentives right we subsidize
incentivize a great deal of
industries including renewables
it's it's just it's hard to tell
I mean I think if we put our
head down and and you know try
to crunch some numbers I might
be able to come up with a
specific number of years but I
think the the most appropriate
answer at this point is we we're
just not sure.
Mr speaker and gentleman it's
because.
If I do my numbers correctly but
the best yes Mr speaker and
gentleman.
It's at least five years before
we see any revenue for
substantial revenue from the
green energy project and maybe
ten years depending on what
happens with some of the bills
that are being pushed for right
now so with that final point.
Is as we continue to look
through the next.
Proximally four days of the
session.
And into the next year with a
thirty day session I I I just
want to remind the body that.
Each and every time.
The we look at a bill that
penalizes the opportunities and
sort of partnering with the
opportunities looks all and gas
industry each and every time
that a member votes on this
they're actually voting to not
help their district and so with
that Mr speaker and gentleman I
yield back.
Seeing further debate the
gentleman from Bernalillo simple
and extremely Sikora San Juan
and was there well let's get
counties Representative Harry
Garcia.
Madam speaker all.
The gentleman from really
appealed.
I yield Mister speaker.
Gentleman from Bernalillo at the
beginning of your presentation
you mentioned the tribal capital
outlay funds are coming from the
general fund is that correct.
I'm just.
Thank you gentlemen I'm not all
of them but there's a lot of the
ones from the executive are
coming out of the gender.
And did you did you mention
public about eighty million
dollars coming out of the
general fund for cable capital
outlay funds.
Mr speaker masculine it's a two
point six million from the
general fund not all of our for
travel projects but I.
Good deal you're breaking up on
me I didn't hear the answer
speaker.
It's not madam speaker gentleman
it's eighteen point six million
from the general fund with
rough the.
Nine million roughly ninety for
tribal.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman
why do you have any idea why we
didn't give the money out of
severance tax.
In the state of all general
fund.
Mr speaker of madam speaker
gentlemen you don't I'm not sure
at the that's that's part of the
negotiation and I'm not sure
exactly why the pre programmed
that way.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo the reason I asked is
of his last year of knowledge up
to log me that came from the
general fund with the Beatles
no just concerned about the
tribal
entities getting not be told
again from their capital outlay
since it's coming out of the
general fund
that a possibility only speaker
gentleman
I believe part of the reason was
precisely because so so many of
those Beatles happened happened
at eight it seems to me that the
executive was in part try to
make it right.
I I don't know that that's a
possibility I mean obviously
never say never but it seems to
me that the there's a pretty
deep commitment to ensuring that
this money goes out immediately
that's why it's in general fund
verses theme would have to wait
a few months for those to be
sold but the commitment date it
seems is is very strong to get
these things out as soon as we
can.
Madam speaker to you don't
really deal that does just a
concern of mine.
Of
No she's not getting of the door
for for reason and up one more
question manage peak and
gentleman from Bernalillo.
What is the easiest way.
Which is more likely to get be
due to service staff Bob the
general fund.
I've got a lot.
Miss madam speaker delimiting
that's that's the problem of the
government of the one is easier
than the other I think you know
governor's veto projects all the
time Senator number of different
factors are not solely on
whether it's just to be or
gender.
These Barbie knowledge is going
to kill all of them he died in
your last response.
I'm sorry Mr speaker up
gentleman my apologies I was
stating that you know that's a
rocket above the executive an
individual projects all the time
and and I don't know that eight
coming from general fund or as
to be makes a difference I think
last year was a very peculiar
here for a number of reasons
and you know I I I don't foresee
us having that issue again as I
said at the beginning never say
never but I I do know that the
executive through their work is
was really trying to make sure
that those projects were funded
in general fund allows those
projects to be funded you know
almost immediately versus STBs
which take longer to fund.
Thank you.
Madam speaker one of you though
just a concerned because it
seems like the everything that
was in general fund last time to
give you two numbers concerned
about that thank you gentleman
from Bernalillo thank you madam
speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen we are
going to roll this bill we are

folks that we're focused on in
our criminal justice system or
those who or not terminally ill

obviously leave the criminal
justice system in a responsible
way so as to ensure that they
can be cared for outside of the

would like to introduce my co
Sanchez who just introduced a
amendment today Representative
Eli for questions that we have

that the amendment with that
Madam speaker all all all all

Madam speaker generally able to.
Indeed all yield Madam speaker
Madam speaker gentle lady what
we added it was what is called

We have met certain requirements
that are laid out in the bill.
To

Once they have been released
from prison.
they cannot go while they're in
person.
right to serve on a jury under
certain circumstances and right.
Just serving in office of trust
as defined in the bill there are
also mechanisms in here.
For registering people as are

is no longer family and how that
works and with that manager of a
trip back to the sponsor the
gentle lady from Santo.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen with that will
stand for questions.
There is further debate the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
Santa Fe and Santa Fe
Representative Lord.
One second please.
This is the madam chairman I
yield my time and I was ready I
was going to talk about the bill
itself I apologize.
Hold on one second.
Thank you.
Gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln madam speaker sorry we
we are sorry I was got so bad
advice I thought with that we
were on the amendment we are in
the bill I do apologize with the
Gentlelady from Santa Fe please
yield.
I will yield to my friend from
C. pack.
Thank you for
Madam speaker so what I was
looking through this bill.
One of the things that came to
my attention I noticed on page
five.
Online twenty three that we have
it in many convicted of first
degree murder shall not be
considered eligible for this
geriatric parole.
So they got me to thinking
course.
Because in my education my
degree is in psychology with an
emphasis in neuropsychology.
And I started thinking about
people who.
Probably should be exempt from
this as well.
Because what happens I'm
thinking about sex offenders
because what happens with sex
offenders that second OCD
repetitive behavior and so far
we really have no shores.
What they found in a study in
two thousand eight as that
people that are sex offenders
have decreased brain matter and
it results in a compulsive
behavior with their compelled to
right and the last children over
and over again.
So when I was doing my research.
There was no cure for peta files
and there was extremely and
limited rehabilitation for
rapists and that was if they're
in there because on instantly
and they're still high rate of
recidivism.
And.
So when I was reading through
this I was thinking.
In a really good idea would be
to not put the sex offenders
back out in the street.
And that's because you percent
of all right this have a prior
conviction and the typical had a
file will commit a hundred
seventeen sexual crimes in the
lifetime that's nationwide in
Virginia they have bound for the
bigger Genya criminal sentencing
commission that falls molest
averages three hundred children
on the line.
So thinking about that do we
really want to released sex
offenders back out to community.
When the bureau of justice says
that there are four times more
likely to be arrested on another
crime.
And all this pent up bile.
As a hundred and one years old.
So files and sex offenders don't
quit.
Rating and molesting children.
So what I've done and that's
okay I would like to present an
amendment.
That I'm bringing forward as I
can discuss that amendment
please.
Can move amendment for
discussion please.
Gentlelady to move the
amendment.
Initiatives thank.
Thank you madam speaker so the
amendment is.
Two two zero six one four point
two I believe everybody should
have that.
Would you hold on one minute
Representative absolutely thank
you.
Members of the house we are
making sure we have the correct
amendment we will be right back
with you.
Madam speaker Representative Max
point something that clear some
things up.
State your point.
Senator.
The bill that's before us is
Senate bill one fourteen it was
amended earlier and House
Judiciary Committee.
With the amendment that's
attached to it.
People on the floor may have
what's called an amendment
proposed amendment directed to a
committee to March fifteenth two
thousand twenty one but that
amendment has already been
attached to the bill by
committee vote so there's not an
amendment pending right now on
the house floor thank you madam
chair.
Thank you gentlemen for that
clarification.
Generated please state your to
go to a number.
Thank you madam speaker and
thank you for everybody for
clarifying that.
So on this ammendment this
budget.
To
to to zero six one four point
two is the number.
This has been passed out and it
is on the website generated to
explain the amendment thank you
so much then speakers so this is
going to be a house floor
amendment number one to.
Just be one fourteen and that is
a that has been amended.
And on page six.
Between lines twenty four twenty
five or inserting the following.
An inmate convicted of a sex
offense as defined by subsection
one of section twenty nine
eleven eighty three NMSA
nineteen seventy eight shall not
be considered eligible for
medical or geriatric parole.
And to we letter the seceding
subsections accordingly.
Generated from Santa Fe is this
a friendly amendment.
Is an unfriendly amendment madam
speaker gentle lady.
Is there debate on the
amendment.
Representative from Lee County.
Thank you madam chair this is
gentle lady from Santa Fe yield.
Yes I just need to the top and
from the county.
So madam chair gentle lady as I
understand your amendment all
you're trying to do is
And session that as an as a
concern with respect to.
the existing bill as a submitted
so can you explain to me why
this is important to you Madam
chair gentle lady.
Thank you John McKinley County
so why that's a concern for me
just because as I stated before
when I was getting my degree
when we studied sex offenders
there is no cure.
As I just stated.
The average doctor will commit a
hundred seventeen sexual crimes
of the lifetime for the national
sex offender registry and
Virginia based on the speech
three hundred times in a
lifetime.
I don't think that's the kind of
people that we want to release
there was a New Mexico man who
was released not too long ago.
He was released from prison
present and one week right three
children.
I don't think this is the kind
of people that we want to
release.
Sex offenders sex and their
entire lives they don't suddenly
get better it's one of the.
Disorders because there is no
cure there is no rehabilitation
these people and I don't think
they should be out in the
community released at any rate
for any age for any reason to
keep New Mexico state I mean I
think it's that simple we want
to keep our state safe.
Madam speaker and gentle lady I
I I appreciate that can you
madam speaker speaker and gentle
lady.
Possibly.
Consider reason why this would
be considered an unfriendly
amendment.
And what the.
We're what the impetus for
somebody to consider this would
be maintained from the amendment
would potentially be.
Thank you John I mean the
question but I I don't want to
speculate on another
representative on what on what
the reasoning for because that
would calls for speculation on
my part so I can't really answer
that question and all forms.
I appreciate that and and I
understand your lack of desire
to speculate and so I I I to
believe that this is important
Madam chair gentle lady we've
we've had conversations on this
on a multitude of bills as I've
gone through C. pack and
unfortunately all of them would
seem to be unfortunately when it
comes with respect to the
sextants and other files and.
Different.
Right this serial rapist and
stuff like that when is it is
unfortunate but I I agree with
your amendment madam chair and
gentle lady and I will support
thank you.
Thank you gentleman from the
can.
Is there further debate on the
amendment.
Seeing then the gentle lady from
Deng Anna I move to table.
Madam chair calls for eight
Senator vocal Bill.
We are on a mission to table
house floor amendment number one
to Senate bill one fourteen.
Speaker Representative range and
Santa Fe.
Okay.
We are on a motion to table
house floor amendment number
one.
Two Senate bill one fourteen as
amendments the vote is now open.
The vote is about to close.
The clerk to call all those
members without a recorded vote.
Representative Chatfield.
Representative Chatfield folks
know.
Representative Madrid.
Yes.
Representative yeah.
Representative yeah I'm very.
I wrote forty one and that
affirmative and twenty eight in
the negative the floor amendment
has been tabled we are back on
the bill.
Thank you madam speaker I'm
gonna speak real honestly here
my heart hurts.
My heart hurts that.
Sex offenders released back at
the community in our state of
New Mexico and it literally
hurts my heart and just
literally poked a soul hole in
my soul is also your sense I
don't understand why we would
not.
This is a friendly amendment we
were keeping sex offenders off
the streets where there's
actually no cure for them and
the first thing they normally do
is go back and commit sex crimes
so I am This with my apologies
to the people that are going to
be raped or molested when these
people are released I tried
thank you early spent time.
There is further debate the
gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln representative Nibert.
Thank you madam speaker will
that gentle lady from Santa Fe
County yield.
I will you madam speaker thank
you.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you Jari.
For.
The.
Madam speaker gentle lady the
original.
Senate bill one fourteen dealt
with one subject as as I read as
I recall and committee and that
was geriatric inmate release
without the actor.
Madam speaker gentleman that is
accurate and within that portion
of law that we're seeking to
amend just building off of the
last serve comments that we did
here is that this piece of
legislation was endorsed in the
interim committees by victims
advocates by the district
attorney's public defenders
supports the office of the AOC
corrections department and of
course criminal justice
representatives so it's very
strong piece of legislation
and then of course well that it
in the sense of who it is that
we're seeking to release on this
type of.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
and would you agree with me that
the efforts for Senate bill one
fourteen ounce originally are
crafted was specifically
tailored and narrowly tailored
to address.
Inmates who.
We're over the age of thirty
five suffered from a
debilitating or chronic illness
or disease I don't constitute a
danger and.
That they're released was
basically.
Understanding that they have a
fairly short period of time in
which to live.
Madam speaker gentleman
absolutely that is the vast
portion of this bill.
The vast portion that that was
really the the whole intent of
it.
Madam speaker gentleman yes that
is what before the amendment the
intent of the bill absolutely
now we're right now we're
talking about the original
Senate bill one one fourteen
before the amendment that was
put on injured Fisher so you to
agree with me that that was the
universe but we were trying to
capture and that legislation.
And.
Basically as I go through the
bill
you know we see a lot of.
Detail as to what this.
Sure procedurally in dealing
with that specific inmate that
meets those losses as direct is
that correct.
And speaker gentle and yes this
bill absolutely relates to
probation and parole and of
course this ammendment address.
Madam speaker thank you very
audio cut off toward the end of
her statement that she could
stripper repeat place the last
portion of the statement.
Yes madam speaker gentlemen
forgive me my internet it's
always a bit spotty at this hour
on the amendment addresses rates
on probation and of course This
bill relates to probation and
parole overall.
Madam speaker gentle lady
several appropriations overall
it really doesn't deal with
appropriations overall it deals
with appropriations with respect
to a specific.
Very narrowly tailored
individual within the
corrections department doesn't
not.
Madam speaker gentlemen if you
have a specific question about
what the merits of the bill are
we'd be happy to answer them I'm
just trying to follow what your
question is at this point one
more question that was United
broader statement that what I
think the original Senate bill
one fourteen address the needs
of other deals with probation
parole generally and I'm I
disagree with that statement by
reading this bill in its
original form was that this bill
dealt specifically with allowing
the geriatric inmates.
To meet the qualifications to be
released because they are
virtually at the end of their
life and it doesn't deal
generally with probation and
parole it deals specifically
with those few inmates who are
geriatric inmates does not.
Madam speaker gentlemen
if I'm going to be quite
specific the original bill deals
with probation and parole
conditions and the amendment
addresses rights on parole
so we're regarding that the bill
and it's important today that's
what we're addressing here.
Some sort of could you show me
Original Bill where individuals
with inmates other than
geriatric inmates.
You madam speaker gentle
gentlemen if you're you're
correct those are the automatic
we're the regional Senate bill
one fourteen deals with
medically ill and geriatric for
example.
Madam speaker and and gentle
lady thank you you for that and
so this afternoon I think it was
after the noon hour going it's
got to this bill
we added.
An amendment in the house
judiciary which was essentially
house bill seventy four maybe in
a modified State.
If I recall my house bill
numbers correctly it was house
bill seventy four not amendment
was identified as point two two
zero eight four four point one
and that was amended on to this
bill do you recall that for
Madam speaker gentle lady.
Madam speaker gentleman yes I
was there with you when it was
amended.
And in the subject matter of
that amendment how would you
characterize that subject
matter.
Madams the gentleman and again
this for cards role rates after
folks have done and they're
doing the rights that happens
after you leave left the system
thank you gentlemen and if I may
madam speaker gentleman if
there's anything on the
amendment that you have specific
questions on a be happy to defer
to my co sponsor representative
Ely.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
that will be certainly
satisfactory of me but but you
may be able to answer the
questions I don't think it will
be.
That specifically
Madam speaker gentle lady the
subject matter.
Of the.
A member.
Is not really probation parole
it's the reinstatement of
certain rights.
Of people who have been released
from incarceration would would
that be an actor stated.
Yes madam speaker gentle and I
believe that would be accurate.
And so my my real question what
I'm really struggling with and
and the.
What I.
I am having a hard time
grasping.
It seems to me that this
ammendment.
Is.
An effort to incorporate.
Or use the original vehicle.
To incorporate a bill that may
not have been moving anywhere
and to bring a new subject
matter on to a bill that was
close to final passage and I
believe in article four section
sixteen of the constitution.
We are prohibited from passing
legislation that embraces more
than one subject matter and I
submit to you that the bill in
its amended form.
Now contains two subject matters
one being geriatric inmates and
their ability to be released
prior to their eminent doubt.
And that's been coupled with.
Right the boat ride to serve on
jury other things are inmates
who are not geriatric patients.
And madam speaker and gentle
lady of for that reason I am
concerned that we are this
legislation now violates article
four section sixteen of the New
Mexico constitution that
prohibits the incorporation of
bills in that fashion so with
that
I'm I'm having a hard time with
that issue and I think I think
that we might want to look
carefully whether whether that
amendment doesn't that
violate our constitution because
of that does a good job for us
this legislation
Madam speaker gentle lady one
last question are you mentioned
in your remarks earlier.
Thank you and that was direct
from victims advocate or groups
are could you identify one or
more of those.
I believe you're on mute.
Madam speaker gentle gentleman
I'm sorry was there is specific
question I I miss that part and
sorry
yes madam speaker gentle lady
could you identify the the
victim advocate groups where you
separate your consulted worked
in and pass this legislation.
Sorry for that
Madam speaker gentleman I forgot
to tell you that I was
conferring with my experts
Douglas carver
The New Mexico's sentencing
commission madam speaker
gentlemen have victims advocates
on that commission confirmed
over the interim period to be
able to of that this piece of
legislation and ensure that it
was ready for the prime time
that you see today.
So madam speaker gentle lady you
don't have the names of the
groups of.
If I could madam speaker
gentleman's if the generally we
deal I think we can answer that
question.
Thank you madam speaker I will
happily yields to the gentleman.
Madam speaker and gentleman as
for listing these are she's
going to quickly so I'm going to
do this a little bit at a time
so it goes to the sentencing
commission
I'm sorry.
And madam speaker gentle in New
Mexico sensing Commission
unanimously supported this bill
yeah Senate bill one fourteen as
for after.
Including the department of
corrections.
Parole board director.
DA's office.
AG's office public defender.
Probation and parole.
The dust off of course.
And the private bar.
And I think that concludes the
answer I just want to make sure
that we flushed out what was
happening with the sentencing
commission so that you more
Madam speaker gentleman who was
employed which is what I think
you're asking point Senate bill
one or two.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
Santa the specific question was
victim advocate groups for you
gave us an overview of through
no way down on this and I
believe that that's the
information we needed Madam
speaker gentle lady from Santa
Fe and gentleman from Santa
thank you for the answers to
your questions and and
appreciate the opportunity to
explore that potential issue
thank you.
There is further debate the
gentleman from Bernalillo
Representative Rehm.
Mr speaker or madam speaker will
the gentle lady from Santa Fe
yield.
I will yield to my friends often
seen in C. pack as well thank
you madam chair Madam speaker.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady
I just received a text message
from district attorney Diana
loose and they oppose she's
ahead of the dust ushers shin
and may oppose this legislation
just for clarity Madam speaker
and gentle lady
I have a couple questions that I
want to speak about our want to
question about first and if we
go to the very back of the bill
the original bill you repeal
section thirty one dash twenty
one dash twenty five point one.
And when you look at that
section.
Number five is.
At the time of release.
Prescribed terms and conditions
of geriatric or medical parole
including medical supervision
and in troubles a periodic
medical evaluations was that
replaced somewhere else in the
bill or totally repeal.
Just one moment
of and gentlemen madam speaker
as a confer with my expert on
this moment.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen so what we have
done it almost exactly as you
described is updated the current
statute to basically be in line
with current practices within
corrections department so if you
read that portion of the statute
that we did repeal
looking specifically at
geriatric and medical patients
that are to be released madam
speaker John and those are the
folks that we wanted to clarify
in statute as to what the
practice would be for current
for the current situation of
corrections and so it's now
solidified in statute what what
they're already doing in the
practices that they're following
is what the bill clarifies today
what what's which is what before
what is before you today thank
you madam.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
from Santa Fe thank you I want
to know are we going to have
periodical.
Real valuations or of check ups
on these individuals that were
parolees.
One moment madam speaker
gentleman will I confer with our
experts just one moment.
Madam speaker gentleman's so and
as you may understand with the
way parole is set up they have a
specific plan that they must
follow anyone who's paroled
including these folks that are
included in this bill so they
will follow that parole plan
under the supervision of
that plan and of course
they must comply with everything
under that plan and so this just
follows that same protocol Madam
speaker John.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
from Santa Fe thank you
I didn't see parole plan
mentioned in this could you show
me on page major line that is.
One minute Madam speaker
gentleman while I confer with my
ex for all have a planning
works.
Madam speaker gentlemen thank
you for the question so if you
look at page six
item J. that's what prescribes
the initiation of a planning
process so that essentially any
inmate that might be considered
for geriatric Prokhorov first
has to engaged in that planning
process Kate describes the
process and then as you get to
page seven L. it talks about the
the term of us so basically the
plans of the term of that
geriatric parole is so that's
what I say plan that's what
we're talking about is in
ensuring that the they are on
that planet for for that
release.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
from Santa Fe okay are you sure
that or parole.
But it doesn't say that they're
paroled to to a parole officer.
they are paroled because of
medical reasons.
And it does not appear that
anyone will be supervising them
that's my question.
So madam speaker gentleman if I
understand your question
what I want to do is just help
clarified that the parole plan
isn't specifically included as
in general prohibitions that
this statutes that are we
already have on file still apply
this just clarifies the process
for medical geriatric Ellett
eligibility.
Okay thank you madam speaker
because on another.
Representative coming up was
actually on the parole board we
may address that.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
from
Santa Fe so there are four
rights that are taken away from
a person when they're convicted
one is voting.
One is the office of trust
another is our second amendment
rights.
And they're forced is right to
serve on a jury.
So you in this legislation with
the amendment that you've placed
on address three of those rights
why did not address the fourth
one being a second amendment
right.
Madam speaker at gentleman I
will yield to my co sponsor on
the amendment however I do want
to just at chime in on that.
It those who have been convicted
in particular when it is a
firearm sort of situation ensure
the safety of the public and of
course to ensure that they can
comply with various laws that we
have on the books Madam speaker
gentleman we just don't want to
get them into a precarious
situation where they may re
offend and so that's that that's
something that we've been really
specific about so we do not
continue recidivist
Recidivist programs that said
madam speaker John and I'll
yield to my co sponsor to talk
about that specifically Madam
speaker will the gentleman from
Bernalillo yield.
Madam speaker I yield to my
colleague from Bernalillo county
so madam speaker John and you
saw that originally we had
drafted the amendment to include
of the second amendment rights
if we took that out when we took
that out because it specifically
conflicted with federal law
section eighteen USC nine twenty
two gene which prohibits a felon
from possessing firearms so the
concern was and continues to be
that we can say to another fact
a problem coming out Hey your
out of prison you're now allowed
to bear arms they would think
that's okay the budget could
pick them up it's a ten year
sentence anymore so we send them
down the primrose path.
Without realizing it so we
streamlined process we we caught
that and make sure we limited
obviously if someone wants to
bear arms they can go get a
pardon they can do something to
eliminate that felony but we
can't by state law preempts
federal law and so that's why we
took it out we have to be very
careful not to mislead people
into thinking they were okay and
then they go to jail for ten
years.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo I appreciate that.
So our current need of someone
in possession statute says that
if you're a felon.
And you your conviction is ten
years or more you may possess a
firearm in New Mexico so are you
saying that statute is in
violation of federal law
minister gentleman I'm a lawyer
and so I try to be careful about
this to go and look at the logs
and compare them that's not
what's in front of us so I can't
answer that question I'm happy
to answer that of that issue
comes up before the floor right
now the question is this
restoration of rights could
include the right to bear arms
in my judgment it could not and
you could see Madam speaker John
where we did try to include that
what we have to take it out
because we were concerned about
misleading people into thinking
this was okay when it's not
okay.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo.
The purpose of the.
Amendment that was added on is
in essence a pardon would you
agree by that.
Madam speaker of German no I
would not.
Madam speaker and gentleman give
me a moment we'll provide you
were it says parking and there.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo let's look at top of
page three.
Los in restoration of rights
conventional crimes classified
as felonies and other
jurisdictions.
I'm sorry go down one more
paragraph pardons that'll be
section six.
Madam speaker John and I'm not
sure there's a question enters
question I'm happy to answer.
Madam speaker and gentleman so
if a settlement is pardon can he
then owned a farm.
Madam speaker German couple of
things I would respond that's
not this bill this is to define
pardons I can't answer the
question consistent with federal
law I just don't know so I don't
know the answer to that the
second thing I would say as
you'll notice and I just wanna
go back to the gentleman from
Chavis and Lincoln there is a
lot about parole in here that's
why it's not log rolling this is
same subject matter so I
appreciate that a speaker John
pointing that out.
Madam speaker and gentleman the
gentle lady from.
Leo and you also up from I mean
the gentle lady from Santa Fe
and use from Bernalillo also
pointed out of concern about
children.
And I think that was raised
earlier in the first amendment
that was proposed is the safety
of children.
So I find it kind of ironic that
were not considering now on the
sex crimes.
But Madam speaker and.
Gentleman
Right now let's go ahead and
look at.
The amendment that's passed out
and it's two two zero eight
eight eight point one.
German would you move your
amendment.
Madam speaker I would now move
house floor amendment number one
to Senate bill one fourteen as a
matter.
Gentleman to explain the
amendment.
Madam speaker and members of the
house as we heard earlier from
the representative from Travis.
This ammendment.
Is outside the original title.
Of the bill.
And what we current what we
generally refer to this is log
rolling.
And madam speaker I would direct
everyone to our house rules
eleven dash one.
And read for you.
No law shall be passed except by
bill.
And no bills shall be altered or
amended honest passage so as to
change its original purpose.
The original purpose on this was
Jerry after release I want to
read it specifically related to
parole.
Creating medical in jury Act
report for all procedures
amending and repealing sections
of New Mexico state statutes
nineteen seventy eight.
And madam speaker when we go to
House rule eleven dash for.
It states the subject retail
shopping clearly expressed in
this time.
And no bill embracing more than
one subject.
Shell be passed.
Except for general appropriation
bills.
So madam speaker and gentleman
from Bernalillo this is the
classic blogroll bill.
It violates our state
constitution.
It violates our house rules.
And.
The purpose of this amendment is
to stride.
The amendment from house
judiciary today so that the bill
is constitutional.
With that I stand for questions.
There has been a request for the
gentlemen to remove their
jackets.
Is this a friendly amendment.
Madam speaker and gentlemen this
amendment that you're seeking to
strike is not only not log
rolling it received bipartisan
support on it is on friendly.
Is there further debate on the
amendment.
Representative from San Juan
Representative Gleim.
Thank you madam speaker the
gentleman from Bernalillo county
you'll.
Mr speaker I yield to another
attorney and IT chamber my
friends from As staff.
Thank you madam speaker thank
the gentleman from Bernalillo I
do not sit on house this hearing
but it's my understanding Madam
speaker general from Bernalillo
that you do in fact serve on
prostitution is that correct.
Madam speaker and gentleman yes.
And madam speaker John from
Bernalillo before this bill was
amended with the minutes.
One through five that you're you
can sure house floor amendment
seeks to stride.
In your opinion we're reviewing
this bill ahead of hearing it in
committee what was the purpose
of this bill.
Madam speaker and gentleman
specifically and if we go to the
title it says relating her
parole creating medical in
geriatric parole procedures
mandating improve repealing
sections of New Mexico state
statutes nineteen seventy eight.
Massacre General to Bernalillo
thank you for that.
And I assume you're aware of
articles fourteen see article
four section fifteen of the
Mexican constitution.
Madam speaker and gentleman yes
and madam speaker from the body
I'll just read the first
sentence the opening sentence of
section fifteen article four of
our state constitution.
It reads No law shall be passed
except by bill.
And no bill should be so altered
noted on its passage through
either house hasn't changed its
original purpose.
Madam speaker gentleman from
Bernalillo in your opinion was
the purpose of this bill changed
in its last stop in committee.
Madam speaker and gentleman yes
and specifically I read the
title of the original bill now
let me read the title of the
amendment.
And acting the post conviction
rights restoration act to change
the procedure for restoration of
rights to vote prescribing
duties to the corrections
department and the secretary of
state.
Madam speaker John from
Bernalillo thank you for that.
Now are you aware of what
committees this bill passed
through on the Senate side.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
of.
Trump aspect yes or one of them
was the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
Madam speaker gentleman's in San
Juan so I did look this up
because honestly I haven't read
this bill.
and I generally want to solve
the amendment so I thought that
this was not germane to the
original bill and so I was quite
shocked these events were in
your so I went and looked at
when were these added a long the
process of this bill making it
through both houses before I
even knew that you're a member
was being closed and here's what
I found.
This bill went through the
health and public affairs
committee.
On February eight.
On the Senate side.
This bill one Judiciary
Committee on the Senate side on
February fifteenth.
This bill was then passed out of
of Senate referred to this
chamber.
And then it was heard on March
second in the house consumer and
public affairs committee.
And then this bill servants in
house Judiciary Committee on
March fifth.
And from what I can tell from
the record and I would like some
some direction and some
clarification.
A speaker from the general
number Leo is.
It looks like this bill went
back to Judiciary in the house
the second time is that correct.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
San Juan that is correct it was
actually on our for calendar and
then refer back.
So madam speaker Johnson San
Juan this bill went through two
committees on the Senate side
this bill is passed out of the
center this bill went through
two committees on the house side
was sent back to Judiciary
second time so I committees.
At what point in the process of
five committees was more these
amendments one through five
added to the bill.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
San Juan it is the last stop
today women return to gesture
house Judiciary.
Madam speaker John from
Bernalillo at I'm not sure we do
have a clear example of what our
state constitution it is is
trying to protect against on the
text of the amendment.
And this is no bill shall be so
alter member owns passing
through either houses a change
its original purpose and I I can
understand is maybe it was the
very first committee and there
were some some misunderstandings
about what the bill didn't
didn't do but this bill is not
passed through I committees
specimen Senator are debating on
the floor and the sad part is is
and the reason why this
specifically matter so people
understand.
Is if this bill passes the
governor signs it is this bill
does a lot of very good things
for geriatric people who would
be released on parole if this
bill is now challenged in court
and the court finds that it's
unconstitutional based upon our
for section fifteen there's a
possibility that this that the
entirety of this legislation
struck I think we need to
understand that and I hope the
body will seriously consider
this ammendment thank you.
Is there further debate on the
amendment.
Representative from San Juan
Representative Montoya.
Thank you madam speaker does the
Johnson Bernalillo you.
Madam speaker I yield to my
colleague from San Juan.
Thank you Madam speaker and
gentleman
I would like to if I could have
you look at the next section an
article for.
section sixteen Mr speaker and
gentleman that says the subject
of every bill shall be clearly
expressed in its title and no
bill embracing more than one
subject shall be passed except
general appropriation bills and
bills for the purpose of
clarification or revision of the
loss.
You madam chair speaker and
gentleman.
Are you aware of house bill
seventy four.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
San Juan actually I have two
comments warning this is the
constitutional section that you
just read is the language and
house rule eleven dash for.
But yes I'm familiar with the
house bill seventy four that
passed out of the house
Judiciary Committee and passed
out of this house and went to
the center.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman are you aware that
house bill seventy four is not
receiving a hearing and Senate
judiciary it is sitting there
languishing just sitting there
and not getting the hearing are
you aware of that Mr speaker
John.
Madam speaker and gentle
gentleman from San Juan it's
actually and Senate rules right
now thank you
Madam speaker and gentleman the
interesting thing is the
language.
Of the amendment.
Not word for word but very
clearly is the language of house
bill seventy four and can I read
the title to you Mr chairman and
And Madam speaker and the in the
NMAA house bill seventy four
says relating to elections.
Repealing cancellation of voting
registration after felony
conviction amending repealing
and acting sections of law
Madam speaker and gentleman does
the title there say relating to
parole.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
San Juan the original Senate
bill one fourteen did not say
that but the house bill seventy
four did said that.
So thank you Mr speaker and and
madam speaker and gentle so when
we go and get a the bill and and
we ask for the lawyers.
Who are going to draft the bill
for us to draft the bill
stated Turman generally what
section of law that
language is going to go into and
all of this language that is now
included in Senate bill fourteen
was added today literally just
hours ago as was stated by
Representative lane.
Full back into Judiciary to
change this language.
But the language that now exists
in the in the amended version of
this bill.
Adds the language that the bill
drafters given this language by
itself.
Tyler.
Relating to elections so this
would be in the section of law
relating to elections is a
section relating to elections Mr
Madam speaker and and gentleman
in the same section of law in
our in our law the extra New
Mexico.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
San Juan you're correct that the
Senate bill one fourteen in its
original form would be and the
loss relating to parole and that
the amendment would be into the
election launch.
Thank you madam speaker and and
gentleman.
To be able to change the
meaning.
Of the original meeting of
Senate bill one fourteen which
specifically states relating to
parole.
Creating medical and geriatric
parole procedures amending and
repealing sections of the New
Mexico statute nineteen seventy
eight what had to be amended
into this bill today.
To try and score shove a square
peg into a round hole madam
speaker and gentleman all the
words in acting moderate
changing the title completely
enacting the post conviction
rights restoration act to change
the procedure for rest for
restoring of rights to vote.
So madam speaker and and
gentleman.
Was voting.
Ever listed in the title Senate
bill one for the original
title of Senate bill one
fourteen.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
San Juan no it was not ever
listed there and to use what's
being said quite frequently on
this floor when you bring up
these points that's another bill
and that's another bill is what
the amendment should be or if
you will that is house bill
seventy four.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman.
So
This is obviously and we know
this bill would.
This is obviously a tent.
To put in the language of house
bill seventy four into a bill
that is going to pass a bill
that the Senate has refused.
On their side house bill the
language of a house bill that
had they refuse to share.
that is a question should they
be doing that or not that is a
question that is not the
question before us today the
question before us today is due
to rights make two two wrongs
make a right Madam speaker and
gentleman but this right here.
Is a perfect example of multiple
sections.
Of the law being ignored.
And madam speaker and and
gentleman.
I mentioned earlier that the
process that we go to to have a
bill drafted is that we take the
language that we want for a
bill.
And the lawyers.
our bills drafters who work in
Legislative Council services
then come back and they six the
title now there's something
there's a little bit of
We will room that we have to
help with the title just a
little bit but generally they
are very very particular as to
what section of law that bill.
Should go into but.
Madam speaker and gentleman had
a conversation with someone from
Legislative Council services.
Literally just a few minutes
before this debate or before I
got on today this bill and I was
asked about exactly what we're
talking about here the language
in house bill seventy four
relating to elections the Senate
bill one fourteen relating to
parole the adding of the
language in the amendment that
went through Judiciary earlier
today.
And.
The sections of of law that I
was directed to in our
constitution are the two that
have been presented today.
And.
The.
Person that I talked to and
Legislative Council services
said this is very prob
problematic.
It appears to be completely
log rolling and appears to be
looking to do exactly what
section fifteen of article four
states is hijacked in the bill.
Putting other language into that
bill along the way because they
believe that bills to be passed
and the whole reason for the
constitutional it reads as it
is.
But.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
Those bill drafters.
They were trust.
This house and this legislature.
Employees.
Those folks and Legislative
Council services and so what I
was told when I asked well how
did this how could this have
happened this this change to
Senate bill one fourteen how
could it be changed so
dramatically knowing the rules
Madam speaker and gentleman that
of those lawyers Legislative
Council are are supposed to
maintain.
And what I was told was that.
If they are instructed even if
it's unconstitutional.
If they are instructed to put in
that language they have no
choice but to put in that
language so just because it
appears on this paper like this
today.
Does not mean that this is the
is where these two said this
should be a divided drive.
This is to separate.
Two different sections of
lobbying combined into one bill
obviously voting is not in the
section under parole.
Obviously this bill was sent
back to a committee had already
gone to so could be amended in
obviously to anyone who was
paying attention that is the
purpose of this this is a
blatant.
Attempt to pass something but
Madam speaker and gentleman.
Are you aware that something's
not unconstitutional not
declared unconstitutional
until it is declared so in the
courts.
And if we pass this madam
speaker and gentleman.
In this form this will be
challenged in the courts the
madam speaker and gentleman
Representative Lane.
By a lawyer suggested that the
whole bill might be impaired.
But I believe the reason that
this is being
pushed in this matter Madam
speaker and gentleman is because
there's not a risk here because
the courts have stated that
there is an assumption that if
there is a lot of goes forward
for a specific purpose that
there is a severability built
into it that the purpose of the
bill.
That the purpose of the bill
will hold and the add on or
whatever has been added that is
the log rolling questions that
can be rejected so there's no
there is no real.
Concern on the part of folks to
lateral.
Because it has to be challenged
in court and if it is unless
somebody challenged in court
this will remain law.
Budget Johnson in court
obviously the language in house
bill seventy four which is a
voting rights act for felons.
That we would likely
rejected it's because of the
clear nature this is easy I'm
not a lawyer it's easy for me to
take house bill seventy four
take what Representative Lane
show as the past take our
constitution and show that along
the way that is a bill was
hijacked that is this log
rolling and that the title
should be clear this will be
rejected and called.
That is why we're seeing this
today is because there is no.
Pontian on the part of the
presenters to do this because we
give it a shot.
Maybe somebody doesn't challenge
this in court.
Maybe this some.
Yes it is challenging court will
somehow survive I.
This.
Is
Right so losses and I guarantee
you there will be one because
this is clearly a violation
trying to the Senate is not
being exactly this to me is
provided of malpractice and do
you have any thoughts on that.
Gentleman.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
San Juan you're exactly right I
have gone the Legislative
Council ask Senator draft
legislation and they advised me
that it was what logrolling and
would be unconstitutional and
that I would have to divided
into two bills and that is
exactly what the job is is to
advises the other thing that's
interesting Senate bill one
fourteen.
In its original form.
The vote out of the house
Judiciary nine two zero.
We repeat that nine two zero
this will passed the house on
its own merits it doesn't need
anything attached to it to drag
it down to have no votes this by
itself is good legislation.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman I.
I'm just surprised at this late
stage of the game that this is
the way we choose to legislate
and in particular I'm I'm not
exactly sure why.
For a group of folks who have
committed have committed felons.
And madam speaker and gentleman
I just don't understand why we
would risk the other part is
still on behalf of what seems to
be a priority is giving balanced
voting rights this is the second
attempt to give felons voting
rights and that just has to
cause people to wonder what the
priority is thank you madam
speaker John.
There is further debate on the
amendment the gentleman from
Bernalillo Sandoval county's
Representative Eli thank you
madam speaker will the gentleman
from Bernalillo yield madam
speaker I yield to my colleague
from Bernalillo county thank you
so I just happen to know a
little bit about malpractice
this is in no way legislative
malpractice but I appreciate the
lecture from our gentleman from
San Juan let me let me just say
to start.
That yes we are not allowed to
amend Senate bills as they come
over we need to let the Senate
know that because they're doing
that on a daily basis in fact
are going on an hourly basis of
course were allowed to do this
in the process doesn't end here
if we amend this bill then it
goes over the center fader
concur they don't and then we
have a conference committee and
after that it goes to the
governor so there's plenty of
protection as far as log rolling
is concerned let's first look at
the title of the bill.
It's related to roll.
As.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo eloquently pointed
out this is all about parole
that's what this bill is about
and as a lawyer.
You don't just look at the
constitution.
You go to what way people would
call the annotations what
lawyers would call the case law
interpreting the constitution.
So the gentleman that have
referred to the Constitutional
Court.
You want to look at.
How the court the New Mexico
Supreme Court has interpreted
the words subject to the
constitution says a subject or
every bill shall be clearly
expressed in the title and no
built in racing more than one
subject shall be passed except
general appropriations bills.
So now we look at what is
subject me.
The Supreme Court has sent and
this by the way goes back as
early as nineteen sixty five the
subject is to be given broad
meaning.
So I thought it was a
legislature would want to act
all members having a logical or
natural connection.
He specifically stated called we
are firmly committed to the
policy of applying a liberal
construction to a specific title
as well as to one containing
broad and comprehensive language
in the pursuant to such policy
the term subject as using the
constitution is to be given a
broad and extended meeting so as
to offer us legislature to
include in one act all matters
having logical or natural
connection of the lawyers in the
crowd that Silver City school
district versus board of regents
nineteen sixty five New Mexico
Supreme Court case page thirty
five in considering.
Whether a statute in braces more
than one subject to the terms
subject is to be given a brought
in extended meeting so as to
allow the Legislature polls go
to including one after all
matters having a logical or
natural connection that's your
verses Jacobs that's in nineteen
forty decision out of the New
Mexico Supreme Court the
constitutional limitation was
designed for the exclusion of
discord with provisions having
no rational or logical relation
to each other the Supreme Court
said this the mere mention of
other provisions logically
within the scope of the title
and relating to the general
subject does not violate one
such restriction this
constitutional limitation was
designed for the exclusion of
discord broke provisions having
no logical or rational relation
to each other so the what
legislative forces Roybal deal
with simple years Madam speaker
gentleman from Bernalillo as to
why or what what would be an
example of a discord
first of all in terms of
violating logrolling the example
of an objectionable joinder to
subject would be election
legislation with times for
alcohol sales that's Martinez
versus harm meal five twenty
five Pacific second age sixty
six.
Nineteen seventy four PM the
fact is Madam speaker gentleman
the Supreme Court gives the
legislature wide latitude.
Hello one this body including
what role.
The notion that that's not true
was dramatically expressed to
the very beginning of the
session when I heard from this
body that our house rule one was
not constitutional in practice
report did not address did not
decide that it was
unconstitutional and we were
allowed to proceed so the fact
is is as we're talking about
whether this is log rolling or
not the Supreme Court will give
us wide latitude this is the
same title the same topic matter
and for geriatric patients what
it does is it gives a like to
vote.
Which once they leave prison
they should be allowed to do so
when we get on the amendment of
the bill of chart talking about
the real subject which is why
this is so important you'll be
happy to address it but as far
as log rolling is concerned this
is in no matter shape or form
log rolling thank you madam
speaker thank you John.
There's further debate the
gentleman from Santa Fe speaker
eagle.
Thank you madam speaker is the
gentleman yield.
Madam speaker I yield my friend
from Santa Fe thank you my
friend the gentleman earlier
I'll want to add many speaker
gentle in just one additional
point to what we heard from the
gentleman from Bernalillo and
Sandoval.
And that is that there is an
additional reason for the
prohibition on log rolling and
that is to preserve.
Transparency and openness in the
process so that unrelated things
cannot be sneaked into a bill
without folks knowing what's
happening is so Mister speaker
Madam speaker jealous early I
want to thank some of the others
who debated earlier John which
is San Juan a gentleman from the
other general consent one for so
at the exactly correctly
pointing out the long process of
these bills in this legislation
to illustrate for the body and
for the public watching at home.
The extreme transparency and
openness in this entire process
I appreciate the debate
explaining to the body that this
bill was.
Passed through multiple
committees in the Senate offset
for over here through the
Judiciary Committee on the floor
back to the Judiciary Committee
amended backed out here in this
debate has now brought into.
Right lights all of the changes
that are being done and all of
the contents of this bill I have

attention so this is a a
wonderful example Madam speaker
John from Bernalillo.
The transparency of complete
openness and that again Madam
speaker gentleman I want to
thank our colleagues for San
Juan county for I'm providing
here everyone is watching.
All of the evidence that we
might need for why this is been

Gentleman S. R..
Started to review this seven
page memo.
Yes.
Yes I am planning to do.
To look at the what we call the
fiscal impact report.
A number of state agencies
weighed in on their opinions of
the Parisian combs of the
original bill Russell mature
quite a few public defenders
administrative office of the
courts district attorney's
attorney general's office
sentencing commission
and the corrections department.
Where.
Madam speaker.
And gentleman.
Did I see a man charm.
Voting rights.
Really.
Those agencies freewill Baptist
church amended bill.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
Lee bring up a really
interesting point because it is
the secretary of state would
weigh in on voting rights and
the.
From what you listed they are
not listed there.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
Or create whether you believe.
The state agencies would have an
opinion.
Madam speaker and gentleman from

secretary of state's office has
always weighed in either in
support or opposition and
offered amendments if needed.
But yes they would absolutely
way in.

gentleman.
No this analysis.
Is there any manager.
The secretary of state.
Where.
What we need to believe.
The regional and chair of the
bill had nothing to do.
Was voting rights would you
regard.
Madam speaker and gentleman some
where you're absolutely right
that the the title was very
specific in its origin and it
was dealing with parole.
Speaker and gentleman on I don't
have a lot of legalese I don't
have all.
I don't have a lot of court
cases market research.
To support our position but I do
have some common sense.
Circumstance commonsense leads
me to believe.
That what we have in front of us
now.
Is where you're from.
That went through successfully.
For committees with no
dissenting votes would you
agree.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
late absolutely today and have
the sending boats once it was

member that was present in House
Judiciary voted for this bill as
I did.
And as I would you're on the
floor in this original for.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you to everyone from Bernalillo
I believe I can support you

Gentleman from Bernalillo.
Thank you madam speaker what
will the gentle lady from Santa
Fe yield again.
Yes thank you madam speaker
thank you gentlemen.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
from
Santa Fe we were discussing
earlier at the actually at the
very beginning of my questions
about the release of these
individuals rolled off.
trolleys who are on jury Act
release M..
They're supposed to be
terminally ill.
I would hope that they do live
beyond their six months are that
they believe that there are into
life with a court.
And you spoke about their plans
that they have the parole plan.
And so madam speaker and gentle
lady from Santa Fe I just want
to make it clear that there is a
plan they parole plan.
And madam speaker and gentle
lady from Santa Fe I now move
house floor amendment number one
to Senate bill one fourteen as
amended.
And the two were to number of
this one is two two zero eight
nine eight point one.
Gentleman to explain the
amendment.
Madam speaker and judge of the
body this amendment just
clarifies that the parole with
the parole we will be supervised
and so on page eight between the
lines nine and stand will insert
the letter in.
The board shell at the time of
released prescribed terms and
conditions of geriatric or
medical operate including
medical supervision and controls
of cherry alright medical
evaluation.
And then re number accordingly.
This is important.
What is that individual do we
once he's released as we heard
earlier tonight you know if
they're sex offenders this can
be problematic.
And so this is just watching
over making sure that they're
released once.
Correct and with that madam
speaker I stand for questions.
Generated from Santa Fe is this
a friendly amendment.
Madam speaker gentleman
unfortunately this is and I'm
from the amendment again the
geriatric matter medical parole
language came directly from
corrections and the parole board
therefore it's not necessary
they were instrumental in
drafting this bill and in
addition since I was unable to
debate the amendment I just want
to clarify to that the
corrections department secretary
of state were all there this
morning at our hearing in Senate
I'm sorry House Judiciary I'm
and they approve of this bill so
just to clarify again they were
all part of this process it's
very transparent and this is
friendly.
Is there debate on the
amendment.
Gentlelady from Bernalillo.
Gentlelady from done Anna.
I move to table the amendment
madam speaker.
We are on a motion to table
house floor amendment number
one.
The vote is now.
The vote is about to close.
The vote is closed the clerk to
call those members without a
recorded vote.
Lujan.
Representative Matthews.
By a vote of forty three in the
affirmative and twenty five in
the negative the floor amendment
has been tabled.
Thank you madam speaker and
members of the body it's really
unfortunate because in this show
original form I supported this
bill but I can't support it now.
And I encourage members of the
body to go ahead and vote
against this bill.
I am very concerned about
whether it can go ahead and
become law.
And with that thank you madam
speaker.
There's further debate on the
bill representatives from Chavis
lead Roosevelt Representative
Anderson.
Thank you madam speaker
Madam speaker will the gentleman
from Santa yield.
Madam speaker I don't have the
floor but I would be happy if
the gentle lady from Santa Fe
would deal to me and I'm from
Bernalillo and Sandoval county
probably
then madam speaker my questions
been answered thank.
There's further debate the
gentle lady from Chavis
Representative Ezzell.
There's further debate the
gentle lady from Santa
Representative Powdrell Culbert.
Thank you madam speaker without
gentle lady from Senate very.
Yes I will happily yields.
We need.
We all know that I'm not a
lawyer but I do have some some
questions.
Guard.
To
Jerry after the lease.
Read this over and over and I'm
just wondering.
Generating.
You all decide.
Is that.
It was at fifty five years of
age when everything else is
sixty five.
Thank you gentle lady just one
moment while I confer with my
expert.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady upon
understanding a bit about the
process over the inner
on the Commission basically
studied other states and how
they do this geriatric or
medical release and what it
pertains to the sort of state of
of those in an elderly position
I'm actually the general norm
across the United States is
between the ages of fifty and
fifty five so a compromise and
understanding that the bill
states fifty five is actually
that that
the general discussion as to
what we thought best based on
the composition of the studies
that were provided at we were at
the age of sixty five previously
this bill drops it down a decade
in in basically in line with the
data that was discussed at the
age of sixty five and we were
definitely an out liar for being
so high in age so we're
basically looking at best
practices with this each
component madam speaker gentle
lady.
What the average age.
Is for the geriatric patients
that are currently in New Mexico
corrections system.
One moment Madam speaker gentle
lady to get that data for you.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you generally do so upon
understanding the data that we
do have for this bill and and
what informed it we don't have
the data of of the sort of
geriatric community within the
corrections department
currently.
I don't know how many
individuals that are terminally
ill and our current system.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady no we we do not have that
data to the for this bill.
This drastic.
It is released.
What role does the family.
Released in comparison to what
is in the R. J. and that.
I'm sorry madam speaker gentle
lady you risk you used an
acronym there can you just
clarify what that last part was
there J. N. S..
This is on the relates the
conditions they are sentenced.
The justices and state.
One moment madam speaker gentle
lady well I can for the experts.
Madam speaker gentle lady just
upon conferring with our experts
were just trying to get some
clarity as to the specifics of
your question because since the
Janis doesn't pertain to this.
The.
Okay.
This.
Thanks under stand your question
I'll.
Generating what he said was not
clear.
I'm sorry I'm having internet
issues thank you madam speaker
gentle lady we're just asking
you to restate the question just
since
the Janice the judgment in
sentencing it does not pertain
to this bill per se so we're
just hoping to get some clarity
on your question.
Earlier.
And some of the discussion it
was stated that.
The.
Her role the probation and
parole.
Conditions.
Role as to how this person.
Is sentenced whether he or she
would be
pardon.
Are not.
So I'm trying to get a better
understanding.
Is there sentencing structure it
register as a sex offender they
would have to go to school they
would act.
To graduate from school that
would have to meet all these
conditions.
So what role that way now so
this person was ill.
Is that all.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady I'm gonna just turn my
video off so I can make sure I
can answer your question so as
it pertains to pardon Senator
gentle lady the governor is the
only person that can and can
offer part in madam speaker
gentle lady as far as any
specific conditions of release
on probation or parole the
parole board of course will be
the enforcing mechanism for that
everyone who participates in any
sort of parole situation needs
to have it approved parole plan
and of course the department of
corrections has procedures in
place to address literally every
single step of the way down that
line
And including the fact that for
the parole board itself was
involved in drafting the
language in the bill to ensure
that there was that oversight so
as far as the initial portion of
what you were discussing that's
not at all I think what's
as far as you know the
sentencing piece and and what
you're talking about we have a
completely different process for
release Madam speaker gentle
lady.
Can you tell me.
Vigil.
Who is terminally ill.
Is released.
Two family members.
The mobile.
For the treatment.
Responsible.
For the treatment of this
individual.
Responsible for this individuals
medical costs.
And.
Well so what.
It
is over one.
Madam speaker gentle lady the
process for conducting a plan is
precisely what you're talking
about they have to put together
all of those components to
understand that any one could
comply with the.
The needs of their parole
just a video so you can hear me
that set madam speaker gentle
lady you know we basically they
have to comply with that plan
and they're not released at all
and still safe medical care is
in place and that's one of the
crucial components of this bill
that they are set up for that
release on Medicaid and the
parole board has approved of
that release on upon that plan.
No waiting.
No one to.
This individual.
Responsible for this individual
who is terminally ill.
Is to them then.
Madam speaker gentle lady if
they cannot meet the demands of
their release and it will not be
released madam speaker gentle
lady so any of those who may be
eligible and I did get that data
just based on the last questions
that we were asked there are
currently seven hundred and
sixteen people fifty five and
older in the system if any
single one of those folks cannot
comply with the conditions of
parole is determined by the
parole board they will not be
released.
My question was very active in
my.
Not about the number.
Fifty five and older.
And may I thought maybe it might
be a thousand of them back.
I'm just curious about the ones
that are not receiving very
active care and our current
corrections just.
One
and only.
You get
The first.
We.
Madam speaker gentle lady as far
as the statistics that I do have
available right now we do not
have how many people are under
geriatric care that have been
released on parole that said
Madam speaker generally B. in
the previous calendar year less
than five people I applied for
that status prior to comment so
if that gives you any indication
as to the numbers that's where
we stand.
Thank you.
It will.
Is
that's family is overwhelmed can
no longer.
Take care of that individual.
What happens then.
One moment madam speaker gentle
lady.
Madam speaker gentle lady so
despite.
Despite the fact that we don't
know and that the situation is
ever taken place just for the
hypothetical you just of the
proposed essentially they would
have to come up lately with the
new plan in front of the
proboards if they couldn't
comply
we've never had that situation
in our state to my knowledge
Madam speaker gentle lady but
last year there about a hundred
and twenty I guess referred to
the parole board only eight were
approved for release and so in
the sense that they were
approved there consistently
reviewed and the continue to be
made eligible for that program
under that review that said in
the years prior only one was
released in twenty eighteen and
one in twenty nineteen so
essentially the parole officer
would assist with any
alternative placement should
that occur but again that has
never happened in our state thus
far Madam speaker gentle lady.
Question is.
The physician has said he should
be there are they have six
months to prepare.
And they are released on those
bases but they don't die within
six months then what happens if
they go back into prison or
watch.
You know what what happens then
to that individual.
Madam speaker gentle lady just
one moment while I confer with
our experts.
Speaker gentle lady so
precisely at as I stated before
of course they would have to be
a hit in that planning madam
speaker gently under the
discussion of the parole board
and basically pivot to a new
plan and again the parole
officer would assist with that
alternative placement or
situation change and of course
they would stay
the state out on supervision
supervision should that change
so that situation changed and
speaker gentle lady.
This
area is actually spoke
completely responsible for all
the financial.
These individuals is caregivers.
Yes all of his medical care is
clothing is special equipment
is Mexico.
Throughout that period
completely responsible for that
individual.
Family responsible and if that
individual testing the way these
work with family.
Is responsible for the burial
costs for that individual.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady so the person should be
released are responsible for
themselves
under incarcerated and
incarcerated situation is the
only time the state of New
Mexico would be financially
responsible for them once they
are released on any sort of as
in in any sort of situation
again there are responsible for
themselves does not require any
sort of family responsibility
unless that's of course.
Part of their planning but that
said while they are in prison
yes yes they are paid for by the
state of New Mexico while on
parole very often they are
placed on Medicaid and if they
you know in a situation where
they are to receive health care
that is that it does happen very
commonly upon release but that
said madam speaker gentle lady
they again are responsible for
themselves financially and
should any does occur madam
speaker gentle lady it's up to
the discretion of of their
situation as to how those
expenses are paid.
The lady madam speaker if I take
this individual and I have him
or her and they passed away I am
completely responsible.
For the twelve year of that
individual I am.
Responsible.
For any kind of funeral costs
individual.
World conditions played any role
and it will be and respond
natural needs of that
individual.
Madam speaker gentle lady as I
understand it again the majority
of folks who do exit in this
situation are on Medicaid and so
that would typically pay for the
situation that you're describing
should they not be should they
not have a financial plan for
their burial madam speaker
gentle lady.
Thank.
Okay this really really
generally from Chavis
Representative Ezzell.
Mr speaker will the lady from
Santa Fe your place.
I will gladly yields Mr speaker
gentle lady.
Mr speaker in this particular
bill the definition of
geriatrics.
On page two nine fifteen is
fifty five age or older.
And Mr speaker I take great
exception to that.
Because the definition of
geriatrics and I'm reading it
right out of Webster's
dictionary our current refers to
medical care for older adults
and age group that is not easy
to define precisely.
Older is preferred over elderly
but both are equally imprecise
over sixty if I is the H. most
often used.
But most people do not need
geriatrics expertise and their
care until age seventy seventy
five eighty or older.
So that is the definition of
geriatrics right there Mr
speaker.
And gentle lady.
When we're talking about
geriatrics you have mentioned
the word geriatric thirty times
in this particular field.
You've mentioned H. twice ending
your reference C. H. fifty five.
As being
And I don't know I'm looking
around.
The Republicans that are in here
and the three Democrats that are
in here.
And Mr speaker gentle lady.
I'm going to say that the
majority of us that are in here
are over the age of fifty five
so I guess I want to know what
the judges pulled this out of
the air or how did you come up
with this eight of fifty five.
I'm appalled by that.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady actually reference
that yes thirty three times in
the bill of the word geriatric
as we spoke with the gentleman
from Bernalillo madam speaker
gentle lady this piece of
legislation why we reference the
age of fifty five was based on
data an overview of essentially
how this release works in other
states around the country to be
able to look through the interim
process on best practice for
this type of geriatric release
so for those geriatric inmates
and I hope not nobody on.
In the chamber right now is it
here right after in many it's a
it fitting to have engine that
we've described here in the
built in speaker gentle lady the
age of fifty to fifty five being
a definitive Gen geriatric
status across the country Madam
speaker gentle lady in this bill
clarifies originally alright
this the threshold that we were
using which is age of sixty five
without this bill and so we are
not following best practices
without this bill Madam speaker
gentle lady and so that
we between the ages of fifty and
fifty five being the best
practice around the United
States the commission that
settled on the age of fifty five
for this bill to meet this
definition and to be able to
provide this opportunity for
those who meet this criteria as
you see within the definition
madam speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
I'm I really have a problem with
that H. that you all came up
with because you know what this
is the New Mexico
yes I do understand that you do
take statistics from other
states now that that must fifty
five year olds I know whether
it's male or female.
And I'm well above that are
pretty dang good health.
So I I have a problem with that
but whenever you're talking
about the definition of this
person and I'm going back to
need on page two line eleven
this is geriatric and might.
Serving the Senate's confined
under the control of the
corrections department is fifty
five years of age or older
suffers from a debilitating and
chronic infirmity illness or
disease related to aging.
You know what that just it
doesn't jive with me Mister
speaker there when they were
talking to keep keep going on
down in that this is doesn't
constitute a danger to persons
also.
Did you go to flip through here
read it.
On page three line fifteen it
says medical or geriatric parole
and then you go to look in on
down further on page three line
twenty one inmates who are Terry
entry to prominent
incapacitated or terminally ill
can you tell me why in every
other instance for geriatrics
comes up is his medical or
geriatric pro long term care or
geriatric.
This
chart medical or geriatric and
it says that all through this
bill can you tell me why is this
for.
I thought it was spelled out in
the definition of geriatrics
right there on page two Mr
speaker gentle lady.
One moment madam speaker gentle
lady well I speak with our
expert.
Madam speaker gentle lady if you
look at present practice within
the corrections department as to
how they refer on to this group
of individuals who qualifies for
this type of release we clarify
in this language madam speaker
gentle lady
what that what that best
practice is at present for those
that need that Ecker right
Terry is that list.
With.
The Act check permanently in in
the past the date terminally ill
is this type of release.
Mr speaker gentle lady or
breaking up quite a bit during
that last time of.
I couldn't really understand I'm
sorry I'm sorry madam speaker
gentle lady let me just be clear
again so the type of
incapacitation permanently
incapacitated geriatric or
terminate terminally ill the or
that that list would be or
statement madam speaker gentle
lady is what the corrections
department uses at present so
you'll see that consistent
throughout language regarding
parole and release in this
regard is is that Listeria trick
permanently incapacitated or
terminally ill is is consistent
with other statutes madam
speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker gentle lady like I
said us to really take great
exception to that age of fifty
five.
And I have rich is the
definition it's related to aging
in the state right here in the
definition fifty five you're not
a GPS.
And.
I don't want to talk to them
right now but I do have a
problem whenever we are saying
or or or prior to geriatric
parole geriatric parole
geriatric Perot.
Fifty five you know what these a
bit you all of the vendors at
age fifty five whenever they are
released they are going to go
right back to the same
playground Mr speaker and gentle
lady and especially if the
heinous crimes such as.
Sexual abuse abuse of a child
sexual abuse of the child guess
what Mr speaker gentle lady it
will not curb that at all fifty
five is unacceptable to me thank
you Mr speaker.
For the debate Johnson
Bernalillo Representative.
My S..
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady from Santa Fe yield
will yield to my friend from
Bernalillo Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Thank you Mr speaker generated
from Santa Fe I just and all the
our short just want to commend
you Senator o'neill for bringing
this forward it's tremendous
it's tremendous well of to to
most other states if not all
other states is just it's old
hat I mean it's
We have a concept of geriatric
parole in statute is never
utilized it's never utilized and
some actually Prada Dior C. to
to want to move in this
direction this is a long time
coming Mr speaker generated from
Santa Fe and fact Senator Neil
had a Senate bill three seventy
back in two thousand fifteen.
And then pass the Senate bill
two sixteen out of the Senate
thirty one to six in two
thousand seventeen and of course
this geriatric provision was put
into the massive appropriations
reform bill in two thousand
nineteen
the past both houses pretty
pretty swiftly and that I mean
if you're suggesting that this
bill is like rolling that out
about eight or ten or twelve
provisions within section thirty
one so I'm glad that you're
bringing this together but keep
this in mind we're talking about
geriatric inmates by definition
we're talking about permanently
incapacitated inmates by
definition and terminally ill
inmates by definition so all the
civilized countries of the world
including Israel the the
assassin who killed a.
Of prime minister Rabin he
actually got got released of a
couple months before his death
it is incredibly expensive Mr
speaker Jenny from Santa Fe the
last six months of a person's
life.
Medicaid does not qualify if
somebody is in the walls of
they're in prison if they're
transferred to hospice or or
hospital setting then it's it's
it's much it eliminates
tremendous financial stress from
the state so from that aspect
it's a win win as well so would
not comment less Mr speaker
tonight from something we get to
go to all these national
conferences and meet and meet
folks from other states you'll
meet a lot of Republicans from
deep deep red states that are
amazed at why we haven't done
this and we haven't done that
when it comes to promote justice
but this summer when we get to
visit with our friends from
Mississippi and you know in
Georgia and Idaho will be
telling them what we finally
joined you guys we finally join
you guys and we have geriatric
parole on our books so I stand
in full support Mr speaker
gently.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman there's further debate
the gentleman from San Juan
Representative Montoya.
Thank you Mr speaker does
gentlelady yields.
I gladly yield Matt Mr speaker
gentleman.
So thank you Madam Mr speaker
and gentle lady
What are the conditions what are
what are the preconditions for
parole for these folks is there
any precondition just being
geriatric would be enough.
Madam speaker I'm sorry Mr
speaker gentlemen it's right in
the definition on page two is to
what we're looking at as far as
who could meet the demands of of
being of possibly released Mr
speaker gentleman sorry I'm
turning my car off again just to
make sure I can stay consistent
with the connection so it's
those who are obviously serving
a sentence and so combined
income confined in prison or
correctional institution that
meets the demand of being over
US eight at fifty five or over
suffering from a debilitating
and chronic infirmity illness
disease related to aging and
they do not constitute a danger
to the person's own self or to
society at the time of overview
so they have to meet every
single one of those parameters
Mr speaker gentleman in order to
be able to meet the
the definition of geriatric
release.
Madam Mr speaker and gentle lady
maybe I'm looking at something
that's incorrect here but I
believe it says or not all of
those conditions.
Could you explain to me
The meaning of the word war in
that context.
Mr speaker gentlemen I'm looking
at page two of lines twelve
through nineteen as to the
definition of geriatric inmate
Mr speaker gentlemen which
clearly defines the parameters
for what someone who is serving
a sentence would need to be able
to meet the criteria for in
order to be eligible for
geriatric release.
Thank you.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I am
once again I believe it says or
not and I'm not seeing that all
of those conditions that we
present you just have to be
fifty five.
Mr speaker and gentleman just to
clarify the and is on line
seventeen at the end of that
that line
and it's the if I could pull
that I would highlighted for you
it's again online seventeen page
two at the end of that sentence
for end of that statement rather
thank you generally.
I too have a problem with the
word geriatric by that term I
will be geriatric in a couple of
months
and Strickler would have been
geriatric decade ago and so
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
don't know if you played
basketball with Representative
strict.
I'm not one bit so what we would
to look at as geriatric so I'm
wondering Act in this in the
other states where this law
applies.
Fifty five I do is.
Really I I'm I'm not sure we're
geriatric is is defined by fifty
five anywhere else except for in
this piece of legislation I'm
trying to figure out where.
That.
Four four Representative is a.
It is L. W. ascended I'm really
upset because that that is
literally before we come back
together our.
In session if if we indeed will
be back in December I will be
geriatric by this definition and
It.
I don't believe any for that is
consider to be
to be geriatric other than the
term itself.
Has a very specific I I matter
of fact Mr speaker and gentle
lady I consider me that myself
to be you know like middle age
you know I'm hoping the last
appointment here but geriatric I
I do have a problem with that as
as defined the way it is can you
could you Mr speaker and gentle
lady acted show me where that.
In another state in this same
type of legislation that fifty
five is considered to be
geriatric.
Mr speaker gentlemen while
unfortunately aging is the
condition of human Manetti and I
to hope to be geriatrics some
day even by this definition Mr
speaker gentleman and still
playing basketball for that
matter late Representative
Strickler Mr speaker gentleman
this does follow best practice
is offensive as the term may be
Mr speaker gentlemen I think
it's very clearly stated as to
why we've done this is I've
answered several times this
again is best practice across
many many states and actually
many states to provide the age
of fifty as geriatric so we were
at least cautious with that
within the commission Mr speaker
gentleman as to make the
threshold fifty five based on
much conversation deliberation
among many different parties to
to find that sweet spot for our
state and for
understanding how to have a
criteria that made sense for for
those who could be made eligible
but that said Madam are sorry Mr
speaker gentlemen the as you can
see from the definition and
those who would be eligible fit
that criteria and so despite the
offensive may give it does it it
we believe it is well defined on
as to the sort of understanding
that we're trying to find and
the eligibility that were trying
to find within this legislation
thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady I'm not.
I guess going down a slightly
different path.
I wanna give me a scenario.
Or or someone who is.
fifty four years old
Right someone or and
severe battery and then they go
into prison.
And then they are determined to
be.
terms.
And then they were released
based on this law.
do you believe at that point
that justice will have been
served for whoever that victim
isn't for the family of that
victim Mr speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker gentlemen again even
based on those who may be
eligible by this criteria by
definition they still must go
through the parole board they
still must come up with the plan
and they still must be approved
Mr speaker gentleman and so we
do get that discretion to the
powers that be in order to make
sure to make that determination
you know and again with all
those who may be eligible as
we've seen even from the
statistics that I discussed on
previous release not everyone
eight it is deemed eligible for
that so again in exactly what
you're talking about protecting
victims protecting our society
from those who may still be
deemed dangerous Mr speaker
gentleman that discussion as
property that is exactly why we
have a parole board Mr speaker
gentleman.
Thank you Mr speaker and and and
gentle lady at I just I have a
hard time knowing of all the
horrific stories that have been
out there in particular I think
as was presented by
Representative Lord earlier.
I would not much better about
this have we
are caps are sex offenders from
being able to.
This fall under this category in
particular because it is by
definition an addiction.
It's something that generally
are.
Is something that cannot be
overcome.
And so someone who is terminal.
and is given.
A period of time to live.
Doesn't mean they don't have
strength doesn't mean they don't
have the ability to move around
and with strength.
And that's a a the problem is
not a secretary
John by the name of Russian
about died this year and he was
over a year ago
given a terminal pronouncement
that he had less than six months
to live and he lived about.
about fourteen months and
continued with his license.
I'm pretty much doing most
everything AP talked about
golfing and doing other things
literally up to about.
Three or four weeks before his
death.
And so Mr speaker and gentle
lady.
Somebody has given whose whose
terminal and given six months to
live.
Doesn't mean that.
They will die and six months it
doesn't mean that it doesn't
mean that they won't have
strings to get along and do what
they've always done and that's
our concern with the the sex
offenders Mr speaker and gentle
lady is we don't want them to
get out and do what they've
always done we don't want them
what's their last remaining time
on this world to.
Harm other people and so Mister
speaker and gentle lady I can't
support this legislation.
we're gonna lease here minus sex
offenders.
I I know
it's been.
A question Senator says come up
so much during the session.
And been a question asked by
felons receiving certain
treatments and may is.
Been brought out so much the
session but I I believe the
reason it continues to be
brought up yes I believe the
legislation that we're passing.
Especially when it comes to
felons and sex offenders Mr
speaker and gentle lady is out
of touch with our public.
The people we should be
protecting the people we should
be concerned about and so Mister
speaker generally I I just can't
support this I can't support
this I can't support I have
grandkids now so maybe I am
geriatric.
I have grandkids I have
granddaughters and grandsons.
And the idea of someone being
released.
Because of compassion.
Who then turns around and harm
someone who is innocent.
I think our compassion goes too
far when that happens and I
think the risk is too high and
once again Mr speaker and gentle
lady.
This may be a priority for for
for certain.
Representative our state but for
the vast majority of the public
this is out of step and out of
touch with the people in the
state who look to us to protect
them so I can not support this
more to the body not to vote for
this bill thank you Mr speaker.
Distributed right John McCurry
Department would look great
results and Senegal.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady from Santa Fe here
please I will yield to the
gentleman from all those
counties.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady.
I own a ranch south amount more.
And on the ranch one time I
found what we call the murder
kit.
It contained a lot of bloody
clothes bloody gloves.
Thirty nine.
And we reported it to the share.
And they came out.
And.
This evidence into into their
control and it was tied back to
a murder at about the kirke
where this young thirty maybe
thirties.
Young lady was killed.
And.
I years later had to go testify
in this case.
With that being said.
This man.
That I testified in the case and
and was being tried.
Was an elderly man.
It was in a wheelchair.
It looks sick leave I'd say he
was in the seventies.
If this man.
Was convicted of manslaughter.
Or the second degree murder.
Which where in those.
Would he fit in this bill.
To qualify to be released under
these conditions of the of this
bill.
Mr speaker a gentleman
My sincere apologies on hearing
your story that is harrowing Mr
speaker gentlemen on page six of
our our bill we at the
explicitly prohibit an inmate
convicted of first degree murder
they are not considered eligible
for this type of role of medical
or geriatric so exactly
concerning the possible
situation that you're describing
Mr speaker gentleman they are
not eligible.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I'm
glad that.
The you don't accept.
Somebody like that to qualify in
this bill.
What it what point is it
manslaughter where they would
qualify.
Mr speaker gentleman the only
explicit ineligibility on on can
conviction is for first degree
murder.
if it's what you describe is
second degree again just
depending on if they meet every
single criteria of the of of the
geriatric release including the
fact of I think what
Representative from the previous
line of questioning had had
discussed on on other potential
crimes that could have been
committed that they are
absolutely under this
supervision of corrections they
must beat the criteria of a
debilitating illness Mr speaker
gentleman and if they they
cannot be released if they are
dangerous Mr speaker gentleman
and so it is the discretion of
the parole board to make that
determination and determine if
they are in fact eligible for
that release Mr speaker
gentleman.
And Mr speaker and gentle lady.
When it when it comes to
situations like this we had a
hard time.
Finding the body I actually
participated in looking for the
body.
All the horses that are used in
and in the mounted patrol and.
In Albuquerque for the balloon
fiesta they were all out there
we had side by side we've got
people walking we have people on
or wheelers.
We had a we had a lot of people
looking for this body and we we
can find the body and and then.
The the detectives went back.
Albuquerque and interrogated and
and.
Work with the murders
themselves.
To get some information to go
back up to the site and find the
body in that situation.
There are people that committed
crimes that that.
the investigators have to work
with.
And work.
To to lower their sentence maybe
and to provide the evidence that
they need.
To come back somebody I'm just
afraid that you're gonna let
people out of prison.
That have them committed a
horrendous.
Crime.
And and.
It doesn't show that way that
will that way up in the courts
and the that's a big concern for
me.
We have people that are that had
to get the.
Convicted of the manslaughter
when when they killed somebody.
And
that's a big.
Make the change as to what
really happened.
I'm afraid.
Things like that happening you
know and and then and then my
next question to you.
Is how much time with this
elderly guy that was six
practices are.
Before he could qualify.
For further
Right said he's going to get in
your bill.
Mr speaker John just one moment
while I confer with our expert.
Mr speaker gentleman so
precisely what our bill
references is the risk for
violence so we don't have a
minimum threshold for time
served but the way our
corrections department does
operate Mr speaker gentleman is
that they need to know that
someone under supervision would
be eligible for that that they
are compliant that the have been
watching this person they know.
you know how the act react and
could be calm eligible for
release like this Mr speaker
gentleman so that risk factor is
important and they would have
had to have sufficient time to
evaluate that person before ever
deciding that they would be
eligible for release.
So Mister speaker and gentle
lady if I'm understanding you
right.
This this elderly man over fifty
five.
Could have killed somebody.
Got a manslaughter conviction
thanks a big of a manslaughter.
Go up in front of the parole
board and be released.
Mr speaker and gentleman it's
I'm it's not that simple I think
what you're describing is is
not at all the process that
we've designated within this
piece of legislation which in
which we've looked at many
parameters and which eligibility
it needs to be met but again we
web based on there's no
circumstance that would meet the
criteria that you're discussing
as a as a hypothetical Mr
speaker gentleman
the reality for for this is that
they would have to evaluate that
person's behavior four at a time
enough to determine that they
would have to apply for that
type of release or be eligible
based on the criteria that we
discussed within this bill that
we've gone over numerous times
and of course they're just
levels
of that release before they
could be reviewed before they
could be reviewed for release
whatsoever so what you described
it's it's it's not that simple
Mr speaker gentleman.
So Mr speaker and gentle lady do
you have.
maybe a hypothetical on how much
time it would take.
Mr speaker gentle and so if you
understand the definition that
we're providing within this we
actually strengthen the
definition of release in the
sense of how what the parameters
are right now they're quite
vague Mr speaker gentle and so
if we talk about the
debilitating chronic condition
that are as a require more
minute in order to even be
eligible for this type of
release that's actually one of
the reasons why our department
of corrections secretary even
believes in this piece of
legislation is because of that
clarity and again it must go
after they meet those criteria
they then go through the parole
board and and the corrections
process to ensure that they are
absolutely eligible Mr speaker
John.
And thank you gentle lady for
answers and Mr speaker I yield

Thank you Mr speaker Senate bill
two eighteen really is a
technical fix.
in house bill six we adopted a
combined reporting system.
And we have some language or old
statutes that still allows for
folks to choose to elect a
different message than the
combined reporting and so this
corrects that technical fixed

gentlelady to explain even thank
you I'm sorry sorry the church
members to twenty eleven point
one is that correct that's
correct.
Thank you yes the amendment
defines what health facilities
are of the bill as it was
originally drafted just named to
different kinds of health
facilities but often those
facilities go by different names
and particularly in different
different statutes and so we
wanted to be really clear that
these are facilities that are
licensed and most are licensed
by the department of health
there's a couple that are
licensed by
of the regulation licensing
department so we've just defined
health facility as meaning those
licensed facilities.
For questions yes is there
debate on the amendment.
The gentleman curry

Committee here substitute
Senator seventy one as amended

is this adopted generally
squarely I do wish for the
comment before we got to get on.
Mr speaker I'm ready to stand
for questions.
To the one person young though
the hallways were not going.
There is debate on the bill
generate generous Lincoln
Representative Nibert.
Thank you Mr speaker gentlelady
from Bernalillo county yield.
I'd gladly yield to the
gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady when you
started out your presentation
you set all inspected.
Thank health care facilities or
something.
What are I can't remember your
director of would it sound like
it was limited to health care
issues that I hear that
correctly Mr speaker and
gentleman that's correct this is
only applies to health
facilities as licensed by the
department of health or
regulation licensing and only
applies to persons under two
hundred percent of poverty.
Well.
Mr speaker and gentle lady on
less section eleven has been
deleted from the bill I didn't
see that by amendment it also
applies to judgments and we are
amending section thirty seven
does wonders to.
in this legislation which is
outside of the health care
that's just general judgment
statute and limitations of
action and my questions are
wondering yes this bill now
changes in any way the way
people are.
Deal with judgments against that
orders and domestication of
judgments against direct orders.
Mr speaker and gentleman let me
check with my experts who are
from the Santo online poverty
you'll just give me a minute.
Mr speaker and gentleman you are
correct in that that applies two
more than just medical debt
although medical debt is one of
the
primary reasons for for many
creditor issues but this.
Based on a court of appeals of
this is
is reinstituting a fourteen year
are instituting a fourteen year
limit on
that judgment.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
Isn't that what the judgment
statute already says.
Just a moment.
Mr speaker and and gentlemen
there there isn't a limit
currently there's a loophole
that allows judgment creditors
to evade the fourteen year
limitation and this came up and
they of court of appeals case
cattle C. A. D. Ellie our
company versus Seve all and
twenty nineteen what's the court
of appeals held that the
legislature's failure to limit
the common law action on a
judgment of permits judgment
creditors for bringing action on
a judgment and obtain a new
judgment upon which the fourteen
year limitation period would run
a new so this was a suggestion
from the
from the court of appeals to be
specific about this and in
statute.
So although they are judgments
that hospitals file and other
medical entities file or those
common law judgments of those
judgments arising under the
subject matter that is not.
just a moment.
Mr speaker and gentleman of
medical judgments are definitely
covered under this
Did you have a a different
question more specific questions
that I might not have
understood.
Well I guess I should ask the
question Mr speaker gentle lady.
What is the definition of a
common law judgment.
I'm just a moment
Mr speaker let me consult my
experts.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman I'm told that there is
a common law action on a
judgment and that is what allows
this loophole to take action on
a on a previous judgment that
allows it to continue to be
and extended.
And what is most if not all
judgments obtained by and
medical
provider.
B. contractual in nature.
I'm just a moment let me consult
my experts.
I'm told it yes it might be
contractual but the judgment on
that can be continually renewed
and that's what this is trying
to stop.
Mr speaker and gentle lady you
said they can continually be
rendered that's not quite a.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
what the common law action is.
Well judgments generally Mr
speaker gentle lady cannot
continually be renewed Cameron.
Just a moment gentleman.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman my experts tell me
that that's exactly the issue
that came up in the cattle a
case and that was suggestions
the appellate court suggested
that this be fixed in
legislation because yes they can
be continually a common law
action can of continually be
reimposed and are renewed
indefinitely.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
let's not talk about common law
actions for a moment let's talk
about judgments on contractual
matters because I think.
That ninety nine.
Percent of the cases involving
medical issues are going to be
contractual judgments not common
law judge so let's talk about.
The contractual judgments if you
will.
Those cannot be continually
renew online.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
A gentleman of and Mr speaker
let me consult my experts again.
Mr speaker and gentleman my
experts tell me it it applies to
judgments on contracts as well.
Mr speaker gentle lady I'd
suggest your experts are wrong
Mr speaker and gentle lady let's
talk about comparable actions.
Because this is arising under a
bill.
Thank you set of bills with
medical it seems more of that
you're you're covered under the
existing judgments and the
language that censored in here
is really not going to affect
judgments.
That medical providers are
general generally going to
secure our from a point against
those receiving medical care.
And for that matter health care
generally whether the nursing
home visits or or what what
happened.
Those are most of those are
going to rise under some
contractual arrangement.
And so.
This this ammendment for this
language with sensors and here
really isn't going to address I
think the the issue that you're
you're talking about those
judgments are going to be.
Capable of being enforced by the
first couple sentences of thirty
seven dash one dash to.
The car about that you're making
in this legislation represents
the judgment obtained through
common law Accern wanted prior
judgment work through other
means of revival of a prior
judgment shall not be
enforceable after fourteen years
from the date of the original
judge of all which it is.
I guess I gotta go to the next
page.
So.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
Your language in this bill is
going to create two separate
sets of rules for judgments does
it not.
Okay.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman and not my area of
expertise so I have a thank you
for your indulgences I
I talked my can experts
so I'm told that the only way to
revive a judgment is through
these common that common law
action and what this and those
currently can be
continually revived every
fourteen years this will make
that will stop that and for
whatever judgments of they can
only be for fourteen years and
it will be the same for all.
Mr jollity tax I I don't think
that.
Judgment creditors.
If they get a judgment based on
contract.
They're going to have procedures
now and the ability to do
certain things out of our
judgment statutes that will be
different that I judgement
creditor under a common law
action wanted for our judges as
stating here.
Because the latter is limited to
fourteen years total correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman but
they can it can be continually
revived and that's what is
out of the cattle K. and what
they're what we're proposing to
stop so that no case can no
judgment can be revived after
fourteen years.
Mr speaker gentle lady
under the language in this bill
if you are a common law if you
have a common law action
judgment.
You're limited to fourteen years
correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman but
this stops the big ability to
revive it another fourteen
years.
Yes so maybe Mr speaker gentle
lady then you would agree with
me that if you have a common law
action of a project that you're
limited to fourteen years from
for secretary.
That's correct Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady so just.
Just.
I assume that I am current.
If you have a judgment that is
not a common law action and
you're capable of extending
that.
Then you have to you've set up
true different classes of
judgment creditors one that's
capable of extending the the the
importance of a judgment.
M. one class that is incapable
of extending that judgment
pandemic and that the only
differences One may arise under
contract or maybe some other
theory and one arises under a
common law access.
And.
What I see is that you're
putting and the law confusion
because all judgments ought to
be capable of being treated the
same shouldn't matter whether
rising under common law or under
a contractual matter or some
other Jerry the judgment
creditors all be treated the
same and have the same benefits
and what you're doing in the
judgment statute which is
totally unrelated to your bill
relates.
The change in the judgment
statute and instead of having.
Precise language that creates a
mall of Saint you are
interjecting a good definite
charm all wanted when the others
I understand can be that
standard for a time
I don't think that that's what
is in the best interests of New
Mexico to create different
classes based on certain varies
and I think it ought to be clear
to the citizens of New Mexico
what the judgment the
statutes provide and there ought
to be certainty and this
language that you know.
If you want to have a bill that
that talks about judgments
generally then I can see let's
have that discussion but but all
judgments ought to
be capable of being enforced and
I identical method and I'm
suggesting to you that your
language of this bill upsets the
judgment
The judgment stature and the of
the section that started here in
and for that reason I'd like to
vote for the bill that I can't
do it etcetera Changin but
judgment statute Mr speaker
gentle lady thank you I hope
that some of our folks away on
on this because
I I just don't think that the we
ought to be doing us with our
with our statutes thank you.
There's further debate the
gentle lady from Santa
Representative Powdrell Culbert
thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
hill.
I gladly yield to the gentle
lady.
As I just have a what you know
quick question on page five of
the bill.
One twenty two.
The new material all the way
through page six July twenty but
don't do that here in New Mexico
whatever you go into a
healthcare facility for
treatment whether it's by
ambulance or whether it's you
walk you know the lan so that's
already have a case worker
social workers directors of
shell V. already does this.
Mr speaker and gentle lady you
are you are right for some
facilities many do but not all
of them and there's a high
number of of people who are end
up being sent to collections and
the different facilities around
the state but so not everyone
does but a number of them do.
Some health care facility is
they don't have case workers.
Our social workers that help an
individual apply for Medicaid
will our look at their Medicare
to see what's covered and only
did major areas.
Mr speaker and gentle lady they
do not do it at every facility
many of them do but not all
thank you Mr speaker generated.
This for the debate the
job with the San Juan
Representative lane.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady currently yield.
Mr speaker I gladly yield to the
gentleman from San Juan.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady.
So as I understand this bill and
I was the I've not heard this
going too many so forgive a
couple basic questions but as I
understand.
The main import of this bill is
that it precludes pursuing.
Medical debt against indigent
patients that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
correct.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo is there any
reference.
In the bill to indigent patients
ability to pay.
Mr speaker and gentleman let me
check with my experts but I will
say it doesn't mean that
indigent patient can't be filled
or can't be a put on a payment
plan and and figure out what
they can afford that's that is
okay it's sending to collections
and selling that that
collections that are being
prohibited but let me double
check if I can point you to
something in the bill.
Just give me a moment.
thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman at this is the the
bill requires that the
superintendent of insurance
actually establish rules around
of what is
indigent and and what the
criteria would be for whether
someone could afford
to pay in New or would be
exempted from collections but
are studies show that someone
under two hundred percent of
poverty probably little higher
than that I can't afford to pay
additional debt beyond they're
just their basic living expenses
and so
eight even sending to that it's
really not collectible because
they don't have the money and
to pay any out there
credit rating and their ability
to
to to get credit and it is
ruined because of this
collections that they can't pay
but the to answer your question
the superintendent will
establish the after rulemaking
the exact criteria that will be
used.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo are you suggesting
that the.
The superintendent can can pass
a rule according this
legislation that would make.
Someone who is indigent indigent
patients that terms to provide.
Sure they're they're still
collectible.
Mr R. speaker and gentleman
they'll of the superintendent
will us to rulemaking establish
the.
The indices ended sent in the
our.
The income level that determines
whether they're indigent
announced to fall under this and
not be
subject to collections.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo it's getting late so
saying indigent five times
specify challenge for any of us.
But there is a defined sprays
for indigent patients in this
bill is that correct.
Yes I believe it's a two hundred
percent it is is the
Is the amount but they are again
I apologize of clarify two
hundred percent under the
federal poverty level is that
indigent level of the
superintendent will determine
the process by which they're
determined indigent so what
documentation is needed if it's
the total income taxable income
minus
certain at expenditures or what
that processes for determining
the the level of income.
Mr speaker gentle lady
so what you're saying is that.
The secretary will have
discretion about R. or the
superintendents even different
than what discretion about.
The criteria that I must
demonstrate to prove that I am
under the two hundred percent of
the federal poverty line is that
correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo but if I all that
criteria and I'm not a hundred
ninety nine percent this bill
would not allow the secretary to
to ninety as an indications that
correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman I'm not
sure I've followed your question
can you restate that.
Mr speaker gentle lady so what
I'm getting at is is you're
saying that there's discretion
for the superintendent.
But the discretion wise in the
rulemaking for how a person
establishes whether they're
indigent patients are not not
whether they need the depth not
the definition of anticipation
itself is just to find spill
correct Mr speaker and gentleman
that's correct.
So if I whatever try during the
the superintendent puts out of
fight yet let's say it's agency
and I need I I approved the
documentation HSD.
And that's sure that a hundred
ninety nine percent of federal
poverty level.
Then the superintendent is
required to approve me as an
indigent patient is that
correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman you yes
for purposes of exempting from
collections.
And so this bill then provides
that.
if I if I follow the criteria
that the superintendent later
lays out in the rulemaking
process as long as I meet that
criterion I'm under under the
two hundred percent of the
federal poverty level.
I cannot be collected upon for
medicine that is that correct.
That's that's correct you can't
be sent to collections Mr
speaker gentle lady that is
without reference to my ability
to pay is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman of let
me just double check that there
isn't something specific about
that.
Mr speaker and gentleman the two
hundred percent of of the
federal poverty poverty level is
that a determination that
there's an inability to pay.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
So that is that it would be when
you talk about federal poverty
level we're talking about the
income is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman it's
it's based on income and
household size.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo yes thank you for the
clarification
but it's it's not based on well
just is that correct in other
words I could have a job that
pays forty five thousand and we.
With the family of four but I
could actually have real estate
assets.
I can have business
announcements I can have money
to banks.
That could be seven figures.
But if I have a annual salary.
That is low two hundred percent
of the federal poverty line.
Am I in in anticipation
underneath the definition of
this bill.
On just a moment gentleman and I
will ask my experts.
Speaker and gentleman
On page three household income.
means income calculated by using
the methods used to calculate
Medicaid eligibility and so
Medicaid eligibility does take
into account some of the assets
and that you were speaking of.
Mr speaker gentle lady but it
uses the word income does it
not.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes but
the income is adjusted by other
by other things and this is
using the same methods that are
calculated Medicaid eligibility.
Mr speaker generally I guess
what I'm getting at is when you
define indigent patients with
reference to annual income.
And then you to provide
household income with reference
to again income not assets.
Not net worth is not wells this
is a reference to income.
I think what you're craving
here's a possibility that
someone could be eight under the
two hundred percent in terms of
annual income.
But actually have enough assets
available to them to be able to
pay this medical debt and it
seems like maybe you disagree
with my emphasis on the word
incomes up there.
Mr speaker and gentleman
yes the indigent patient means a
patient with a household income
and household income is as
calculated the message
calculated for Medicaid
eligibility which does happen to
take into account
other announcements.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo do you know what the
what two hundred percent of what
poverty level is programs for.
not all of him let me just ask
hold on.
Mr speaker and gentleman for a
family of four two hundred
percent of the federal poverty
level is fifty two thousand four
hundred.
Mr speaker gentle lady so I'm
kind of uneven numbers guys
second was to say fifty two
thousand for the sake of our
discussions up here.
That's fine Mr speaker and
gentleman Mr speaker gentle lady
thank you for that so using is
simple on I'm married I have two
teenage sons so I would be a
family of four so two hundred
percent of federal poverty
levels fifty two thousand.
I do some back of the envelope
math we divide that by twelve
months.
That means my monthly income is
is roughly four thousand three
hundred dollars a month.
Mr speaker gentle lady do you
know what the medium median
income is for New Mexico
Hospital.
The median income yes Mr speaker
generally not all land and let
me see if my experts have that
number.
Thank.
Mr speaker and gentleman the
latest they found was for twenty
nineteen it was fifty two
thousand.
Mr speaker gentle lady thank you
for that so.
What we're saying is that two
hundred percent of federal
poverty level is in fact the
median income.
For New Mexico household and I'm
surely not.
Meeting to be insulted by this
question asked I I'm I'm a math
nerd I got a bachelor's degree
in math but I wanted to
representatives going to
meetings.
And median or or what might
might refer to as average and
meat and medium Mr speaker
generators no difference
between.
What you mean is verses that
average.
Mr speaker and gentleman
I'm familiar with the terms and
at one point and if I have more
sleep I could probably tell you
the difference but I'm gonna let
you tell me Mr speaker generally
fair enough that should be
asking math questions after nine
o'clock
so funding for that but the way
I understand you and I I do
think this is important is name
is basically you picked the
middle point that is the meeting
so you could say then that that
more than fifty percent or or
fifty percent of New Mexico
households.
Are at or below two hundred
percent of the federal poverty
line does that make sense
generated.
Mr speaker yeah out roughly
speaking which would explain why
we've got more than forty
percent on Medicaid
in Medicaid that for an adult is
a hundred thirty eight percent
of poverty so I'm I'm guessing
you're about right.
Mr speaker and gentleman I and I
to with the sentiment you just
shared a page I wish we had zero
percent at two percent of the
federal poverty level
the and I I hope that's what
we're all trying to build a
workforce but that's not were
wrapping to thousand twenty one
and so when you talk about a
bill like this that again so
that we understand there is no
reference to my ability to pay.
And so what you're telling.
Medical providers is that
literally fifty percent of all
New Mexico households the day
after this bill becomes law.
Fifty percent of New Mexico
households can stop paying their
bills and there is nothing that
a medical care provider can do
to collect on that debt.
Irrespective of whether that New
Mexico household is able to
actually paid that debt and so I
guess I just wonder worded the
two hundred percent come from
gentle lady.
let me start with that question.
Okay just a moment.
And gentlemen of research shows
that it two hundred percent of
poverty is is where people
can't.
Four to pay and again it doesn't
mean that they can't be build
but the other important thing is
I just can't be sent to
collections but the important
thing also as part of this is
the screening to get people
coverage we've got a two hundred
fifty thousand people in the
state who don't have coverage
and if you and a lot of people
who are eligible for Medicaid or
eligible for subsidized coverage
and the health insurance
exchange who could get coverage
and could get on that have a
payer source and so that's a
really important component of
this because it decreases of the
indigent care that hospitals and
and facilities are providing and
many who who have stopped
voluntarily have stopped sending
indigent patients to collections
because I can't collect and so
they spend them much more
resources trying to collect then
they're able to that are able to
collect so the the better
approach is to try and screen
people up front getting coverage
where they can.
Of work out payment plans or any
other kind of used indigent
funds and just try and get
coverage of where they can the
but not to a bankrupt people by
sending them to collections and
ruining their credit and ability
to
to get a car or a house or that
rented apartment because they
can't they don't have they've
got a bad credit record when it
can't be collected so that's the
point of the bill.
Mr speaker gently from
Bernalillo actually appreciate
your raising the the spring that
that piece of the bill makes
sense to me there might be
patients out there who really
have no idea what they could
qualify for maybe they don't
understand the system you know
maybe they're too business like
I mean there's probably lots of
reasons why so I think that
screening aspect is useful I
think it's a good piece of
legislation but I still come
back to when you talk about the
the study show that two hundred
percent.
Poverty level or or lower people
are able to pay for their
medical debt.
But there again there's no
reference in this in this
legislation to what a big chance
actually paid for their medical
down is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman there
is to the extent that it refers
to household income is
determined as determined by
Medicaid eligibility which does
look at at other assets and even
Medicaid doesn't doesn't
require you to sell real estate
or just sell your one your house
and your one car if you have
investments you have income from
that in which is counted and I
think they look at
you know additional liquid
assets but I think this is
determined the same way that on
Medicaid is.
Mr speaker gentle lady so.
Let's just.
Take me for example again let's
say not a household of four I
have.
An annual income of fifty
thousand dollars I don't have
any announcements anywhere else
all I have is my my yearly
paycheck.
Fifty thousand dollars.
I think for and your bill I have
insurance but insurance doesn't
pay for everything but say that
seventy five dollars left over.
And I refuse to pay that seventy
five dollars.
Can a medical provider come
after me in that scenario for
collection action.
Let me just double checks.
I'm thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman that's correct you
couldn't be sent to collections
if you're under two hundred
percent of poverty but again I I
want to stress that if you're a
household of four at two hundred
percent of poverty us some of
your children.
Are eligible for Medicaid and
yeah and so again that screening
and ability to
at to get coverage for as many
household members as you can.
I will I greatly increase the
chance that you may be able to
pay a seventy five dollar copay
but you might not have that if
you've got also if you got
screened and had a subsidized
coverage under the exchange
there would be help for those
for that costsharing as well as
your premiums.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo thank you for that I
I I just that highlights.
One of my main concerns with
this bill is that.
There are I may or may not be
able to pay.
that medical bill and I think
that's the issue is.
I think we can have a discussion
if it's where that I'm unable to
pay the bill
you know you can get a judgment
and that doesn't work piece of
paper it's written on if you
can't collect on it so I think
that makes sense to me.
But what about those scenarios
where I'm a family of four and
eight fifty thousand dollars a
year.
And I do have the means to pay.
But what this law says is that I
can tell the medical provider
should go away there's nothing
that you can do against me and I
know that.
And I have real concerns about
that because there are people
granted that are able to for the
medical bills again.
I understand the conversation
but there's also people that
make fifty thousand dollars a
year to family for that are able
to make and pay my medical
bills.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
And so I guess I wonder if fifty
percent of our New Mexico
households won't be required to
pay a.
Their medical bills who is going
to pay for that fifty percent.
Mr speaker and gentleman you
know I I think it's not a likely
scenario that you're raising for
one thing
no medical care is is guaranteed
so if someone is not paying
their bills and has our
ability to to pay of that unless
it's an E. R. there's no
requirement that that someone be
seen and most people I think
the the other side of this is
when people are in fear of
getting a bill that they can't
pay they don't see care and they
don't see care until they are
really really sick and they
still can't pay and it's a huge
bill now and yeah and more
costly for everyone so the
intent is that there is not a
deterrent from going to get of
the care that you need get
screened for whatever of
programs you might be eligible
for that will help you pay for
it.
And work out payment plans for
what you might hello but just
not ultimately send you to
collections before going through
all of that and trying to keep
the cost of care it lower if
you're going when you're not as
sick because you're not afraid
and staying away because you're
afraid of a bill that you can't
pay and that will bankrupt your
family.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo you know we we may.
And I hope that there are people
that take advantage of this and
are I propose a true do.
And we can say that it's on like
we.
But what we cannot say is that
the bill as written doesn't
allow for that's an argument and
that's what troubles me is once
people understand what this law
would do.
If I'm at two hundred percent of
the federal poverty line or
below I now have zero
motivation.
To pay my medical bills zero
because they cannot come after
me that did not select on the
and so I can go to the E. R.
every time for any time I have a
medical issue because I know
that they have to see me and I
know at the end of that visit
they cannot select on and so I
have concerns about where is
that slack going to be made up
from and my fear is that that
fifty percent is going to be
made up from the other fifty
percent who do under this law
are required to continue to pay
their medical bills and not be
collectible and there was a
reference earlier to medical
debt causing bankruptcy and
sending people into collections
so I guess I'm just wondering is
a policy standpoint why did we
even limit This the medical that
why don't we just make it across
the border all day.
Well Mr speaker and gentleman
you're welcome to propose that
in the and run legislation on
that I would support it.
Mr speaker generated when we are
I would not support it so you
don't don't be looking for that
for me anytime soon the and I
appreciate this this dialogue I
think it's helpful to highlight
what the bill what does and does
not the last thing I want to
touch on is at the end of the
bill Mr speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo.
And just briefly because
Representative Nibert RT
highlighted the problem.
But this idea of not being able
to revive.
A specific crime of judgment Mr
speaker generating do you recall
that dialogue with
Representative Nibert.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes I'm
I'm still awake enough to recall
that conversation.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo sometimes when when
lawyers talk we we choose just
to forget as quickly as they can
what they had to say seven point
me for that but on and I'm
looking at the equipment and
context.
It uses the phrase.
Adjustment James right common
law action so that phrase common
law is a term of art in the law.
Mr speaker gentle lady I don't
know do you have.
The statutes that this is center
on this is thirty seven just
want us to do you have those
anywhere near you Mr speaker
gentle lady from Bernalillo.
Mr speaker and gentleman but I
do not have the statutes.
Mr speaker gentle and I'll do my
best to articulate the the
statute but I'm referencing to
in a way that makes sense so for
example what you have poster and
under section eleven again.
Uses a judgment saying through a
and it uses the phrase common
law action.
And this isn't thirty seven dash
one.
Yes to if we go just one statute
lower thirty seven dash one dash
three it provides a prime
example and what thirty seven
dash one dash three says it
talks about and this is what it
says.
Actions founded upon any bonds
promissory note bill of exchange
or other contract in writing
shall be brought within six
years and the reason why
highlight this is you're you're
amending thirty seven dash one
dash to it uses this term of our
common law action.
The very next statute uses these
causes of action that are
founded upon sit for example a
promissory note or a contract in
writing and so that is a very
different type of judgments band
aid common law action and so
Mister speaker gentle lady I
have concerns about there being
protectionist use because now
we're treating the ability to
revive a judgment differently
based on the type of action that
is brought.
and so I do have some concerns
about that and I want to
highlight that as well but again
I think you for the good and
respectful dialogue I think it's
helpful to understand what the
bill does and does not and thank
you very much Mr speaker thank
you gentlemen for the questions.
Mr the debate generation granted
Dogo in Sierra.
Thank you Mr speaker of the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
you'll.
Mr speaker I gladly yield to the
gentle lady thank you gentle
lady I just I did not hear this
bill in committee and so I just
wanted I think I understand
this Mr speaker and gentle lady
it references facilities
organizations agencies third
parties that are licensed by the
state in some places the
reference of the license is to
the facility is that correct or
is it also if your license to
do physical therapy years or
individually licensed therapist
is it is it could you tell me
the boundaries of the license is
a for the facility or anyone who
must hold a license in the state
in order to practice thank you
Mr speaker and thank you gentle
lady for that on clarifying
question is for facilities
licensed by the state thank you
Mr speaker so if there is a
group of.
Individually or group licensed
therapists at their facility in
a practice that is not a
licensed that they would not
fall under this.
Mr speaker gentle lady that's
correct it has to do with the
soul of the that's licensed
thank you Mr speaker thank you
ladies on independently assessed
physical therapist with that the
facility is not licensed
therapist license but they fall
under this Mr speaker and gentle
lady the individual providers
are do not fall under this it's
all of the facility thank thank
you Mr speaker and thank you
gentle lady and Mr speaker and
gentle lady could you please
tell me what the current copays
are for folks in New Mexico who
make less than two hundred
percent of the their household
incomes two hundred less than
ten percent of the federal
poverty level.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
that's
near impossible to tell you
because it depends on what kind
of coverage they have if they
have any and of course there's
no copays if they're on Medicaid
in this wouldn't apply to them
because they have full coverage
but if they are on the exchange
they may have some it depends on
what plan they pick and they may
have some a reduction in how
much out of pocket they have to
pay but that doesn't change
their copays and so depending on
the service depending on the
coverage plan the the copay or
call a co insurance could be
vastly different.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady so someone who
qualify don't folks under two
hundred fifty percent of poverty
qualify for Medicaid Medicare
and state New Mexico today.
No
Mr speaker and gentle lady it's
a hundred and thirty eight
percent for adults and
I think I'll just double check
it's all hot is higher for
children hold on just a moment
John one day.
Mr speaker and gentle lady yes
it's a hundred and thirty eight
percent of the federal poverty
level for adults.
I and and and that's the
expanded Medicaid and for kids
it varies by age but as high as
two hundred and I think twenty
five percent of the federal
poverty level.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady and did the state of New
Mexico set those eligibility
guidelines.
Mr speaker and gentle lady up I
think those are guidelines are
set by the state within federal
guidelines so the state has some
ability to decide where under
general federal guidelines.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady so if if we believe
as a state representative body
that folks making under two
hundred percent of poverty
cannot change cannot be they may
have circumstances that region
from paying and should not be
required to pay or be sent to
collections why are we not
hearing bill it just simply
makes health care free for
people under chambers household
incomes under chairperson of
poverty and fund at the state
level.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
Like the previous gentleman
you're welcome to propose that
kind of legislation but I don't
think we have the money to
completely do that that doesn't
qualify for Medicaid under
federal guidelines we couldn't
go up to two hundred percent
under Medicaid so it would be
state funds thank you Mr speaker
thank you Jim lady and why is
there an assumption that rural
hospitals like the ones in my
district the C. R. just a
hospital in Sierra County is
operated by the local joint
powers of three of the local
municipalities and Grant County
it's under the counter more both
struggling to remain viable
affordable and high quality why
is there an assumption that
they're able to absorb this
last.
Mr speaker and gentle lady what
we're asking and this is that
they screen to try and get
people coverage and in doing so
they're going to have less of a
hit to their uncompensated care
because they'll have a payor
source so that only those that
are truly indigent and no
ability to get coverage would
would be utilizing indigent care
and they wouldn't be spending
their resources on trying to
collect something they'll never
collect.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentle lady and so if they
do could you describe the
federal the federal programs
that they would need to be
advised of.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
Medicaid.
And of the health insurance
exchange so and whether they
could qualify for some subsidy
to help with premiums and cost
sharing on the exchange.
Thank you madam Mr speaker and
gentle lady could you explain
the state funds that they would
need a W. were made aware us.
I'm not sure what your
referencing but let me check
with my experts.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady that the bill is placing a
burden on the sensibilities to
advise everyone of the services
are available side like the main
specifically please.
So Mr speaker and gentle lady
the main group of programs are
Medicaid and and other health
insurance exchange but indigent
funds some hospitals have their
own patient assistance funds
there may be other local funds
that that depending on the
location but
studies show that
you know maybe forty percent
about forty percent of of
patients who who don't have any
coverage are eligible for
coverage and for assistance and
that coverage.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady I think there are some
other publicly funded programs
that people who don't qualify
for in your systems might need
to access that you have not
named
Is it in fact the folks that are
in the private market place that
have the highest copays the
largest deductibles I mean when
we talk about medical bankruptcy
and we talk about the high cost
of insurance is that the people
in the market in the private
market to have five six eight
thousand dollar in deductibles
on incident or any incident or
has tried very hard to pays and
deductibles why are they not
covered and spell.
Mr speaker and gentle lady they
would be if they're under two
hundred percent of poverty.
Mr speaker and gentle lady is
there some.
So I I guess Mr speaker gentle
lady what we're trying to do is
make sure the people that we
have allocated funds for are
covered that we're not trying to
do is eliminate medical
bankruptcy for people over to
her percent poverty or eliminate
collections for people who have
heavy copays high deductibles
and high premiums what we're
trying to do is make sure people
under two hundred percent of
poverty are restored to services
that are fully utilizing the
programs that were standing Mr
speaker gentle lady but this
will not eliminate the medical
bankruptcy if anyone hasn't made
any any for any of these reasons
They have the.
An outpatient.
At
if they have crisis triage.
First an air ambulance any
surgical surgery procedure in
urgent care procedure costs the
nursing home in intermediate
care facility assisted living
any sort of diagnostic or
treatment rehabilitation
infirmary or anything that
happens with the one above two
percent of poverty we're not
trying to eliminate any of the
as their financial burden is
that correct Mr speaker Julie to
people over to a representative
will be responsible for a
hundred percent of the cost.
Mr speaker and gentle lady if
they're uninsured del still be
screened.
but for protecting from going to
collections it's those who we
know by the level of their
household income that they are
that it's they are indigent and
uncollectible.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady so someone who is
screened and is insured but has
a very high deductible and
experiences outrageous medical
bills and cannot pay they will
be sent to collections if they
make two hundred one percent of
poverty the annual federal
guidelines.
Mr speaker and gentle lady if
the facility chooses to do that.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady but those are also the
people who have the highest
copay and the biggest adoptable
so am I correct.
Mr speaker and gentle lady and
saying what we're trying to do
here is to help people who are
eligible for all the different
state federal and other private
programs of the state in
Mexico's funding that they be
screened and be enrolled in
these programs so we want to
fully utilize the programs that
were that are available.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
that's correct.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentle lady
So the people who are least
likely to pay because they have
the most available to them will
be the one to we are protecting
your but the people who have the
greatest cost the middle income
hardworking people of New Mexico
we're just over that income
level we're not providing
protection for them thank you Mr
speaker thank you generating.
Just for the debate generation
captain scoreless you.
Thank you Mr speaker I'm gonna
keep my camera off just because
I have no secure
Internet right now will the kind
gentle lady from Bernalillo Mr.
I'd Leslie yield to the gentle
lady.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady I I up the former
speaker took most of my
questions and I appreciate that
and I know are you know I voted
against this and the committee
and one of the main reasons as I
have a.
What's going to happen in rural
New Mexico and the requirement
in this bill that every medical
facility to have someone that
assists patients in doing this
that's a concern for me and and
and my small district I have I
do have a physical a couple of
different physical therapists
and Sapporo and I have some
clinics and other areas but I
think I share the story Mr
speaker and madam chair of the
clinics it closed
my clinic that closed in Bikita
and they did have one of these
I'm an assistant on at inst on
staff Mr speaker kind lady that
would fill this out and they
still have a hundred percent of
no payers and they still didn't
make any money and they still
had to close the facility and so
I think that this could be
burdensome to rural New Mexico
Mr speaker and kind lady I'm all
about getting people that need
the assistance the assistance
that they.
Need and that they want
the number that we're speaking
about that are uninsured.
They may not I I wouldn't think
that they would not choose to be
uninsured but or on Medicaid or
Medicare but I would think that
I just think we're building
something that's going to be
harmful to the majority of the
New Mexicans that are paying for
insurance and this is going to
come
increased inflation
for the facilities that have the
services and could possibly
cause more shutdowns so I don't
really have a question thank you
Mr speaker kind lady but I
cannot support the bill once
again and
wish you the best thank you Mr
speaker thank you gentle lady.
Seeing no further debate the
gentle lady to close.
Thank you Madam speaker and.
This is our a really important
bill and the most important part
of it is the screening but
It will the screening amount of
screening that's needed and
assistance as needed will vary
depending on the size and type
of facilities so that it's not
overly burdensome but it is far
better for the facility when
they get people into coverage so
that they have a pair source but
in the in the and if there isn't
a payer source and they are
covered
no one should be bankrupted who
doesn't have the ability to pay.
So with that Mr speaker and I
think the body for the questions
on the discussion I now move
