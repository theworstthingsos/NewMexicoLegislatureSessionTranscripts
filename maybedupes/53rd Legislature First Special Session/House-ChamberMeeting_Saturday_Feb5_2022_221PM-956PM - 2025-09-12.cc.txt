afternoon thank you and good
afternoon members I move that we
go to the next order of business
announcements and miscellaneous
business no objections so
ordered we have a gentleman from
Rio Arriba Sandoval in San Juan
chairman Lente.
Thank you Mr speaker good
afternoon members this afternoon
I had the exciting announcement
on behalf of of my family last
evening on February the fourth
at seven thirty PM our family
welcomed our very first
grandchild into the world that's
that's right that my baby girl
J. to more than the had her own
baby girl my granddaughter came
into this world weighing seven
pounds thirteen ounces and
stretching the whole twenty
inches long and the new parents
jade and Thomas and of course
our our newest baby are today
healthy happy excited and we are
also thankful for this gift from
god and so Mister speaker if
it's at all appropriate it would
mean so much to my family and I
if we could ask our our speaker
Martinez to lead us in happy
birthday for our newest baby
girl in the.
Leisure and congratulations.
Thank you Mr speaker
graduations a gentleman what a
beautiful beautiful gift members
let's make this one really loud
for violent this.
The the.
The the.
The baby girl is.
We
may soon.
Graduations.
And Mr chairman what is your
name.
that is yet to be announced
okay.
Behavioral and today will keep
us in suspense.
Are there other nonsense the
gentleman from Chavis Eddy and
Otero Representative Townsend.
Thank you Mr speaker
yesterday I mentioned to the
body of a poll.
And.
That I'd run but.
I had authorized the grant and I
was looking for it last night
and I saw some things that I
thought were worth sharing with
the body.
And there have been several had
reached out.
One of the questions was.
On a scale of one to five with
one being the worst and five
being the best right how well of
the thing the state of New
Mexicos public education
department makes the best
decision for students in the
classroom.
This the results of this poll.
I think show something that we
should all thank you to.
The Republicans that were polled
in they were equal amounts to
Republicans and Democrats.
Eighty six percent of the
Republicans.
And seventy nine point six seven
percent of the Democrats
answered the question.
Exactly the same all.
The next one that I think is.
For.
Talking about with question
number four.
And it is do you believe the
Santa Fe bureaucrats have too
much centralized control of
education outweighing the needs
of your local community.
Again.
Republicans and Democrats pulled
equally.
For both the lowest rung with
seventy.
Point four three percent the
Democrats polled seventy point
four three percent the
Republicans polled eighty six
point to one percent.
My point is Mr chairman.
Mr speaker.
That everybody agrees there's a
problem.
And everybody agrees it's time
to fix.
I was looking again for quotes.
The
same path president of American
federation of teachers said it's
time to admit that public
education operates like a
planned economy.
A bureaucratic system in which
everybody's role is spelled out.
In advance and there are few
incentives for innovation and
productivity.
It's no surprise that our school
system doesn't improve.
It more resembles a communist
economy than are my own market
economy.
Mr speaker.
We're all complicit in this.
I think this is much
responsibility as anyone else.
And what we're complicit in this
trapping the students.
And their parents in the system
that doesn't work.
And we have the proof and we can
prove.
Mr speaker I hope the body can
come together and address
education in a meaningful way as
our constituents Republican and
Democrat are asking us to do.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Thank.
I believe will be a discussion
of the cross tabs on a pole in
room three seventeen at five
thirty.
Are there further nonsense.
Gentleman from.
Bernalillo thank you Mr speaker
I move that we go to the next
order of business third reading
of legislation no objections so
ordered.
Gentlelady from palace are you
ready on item.
Number one thank you Mr speaker
will you please get me to that
point for the record reflect
that all action necessary for
placing House school thirty
seven as amended on final
passage is a taken the
gentlelady to explain the bill.
Thank you Mr speaker HB thirty
seven sets of the community
energy efficiency development
block grants this bill will
improve utility affordability
and reduce energy burden for low
income New Mexicans.
The bill establishes a funded
EMNRD to give block grants to
local and tribal governments and
the mortgage finance authority
to make targeted energy
efficiency improvements and low
income communities I have my
expert witness here Mister
speaker townspeople corn with
the southwest energy efficiency
project with that I am happy to
stand for questions.
There's a gentleman from the
Representative Scott.
Will the gentle lady from time
to.
Thank you Mr speaker I will
gladly leave yield to the
gentleman.
The speaker gentle lady heard
this.
G..
Just a few questions.
With respect to the crowd to.
That will be established to
current series awards.
Thank you Mr speaker gentleman
what are those questions would
you like me to outline the
criteria.
Speaker gentle assumption would
order specific crowd to the
three.
Four.
In order to apply for one of
these awards.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman there are many there
many criteria it's important
that the.
That the applicants
The number of things one they
have to they have to show that
there will be an estimated
reduction in energy use of from
those who are benefiting from
the project there is a
geographic diversity of the
portfolio of the committee
energy efficiency projects the
there needs to be a community
partner and I think that's
really really important for me
jobs perspective that's going to
be working with that local
government or the tribe or the
end of the political
subdivisions there there needs
to be or there should be any way
a a an apprenticeship program so
folks who are learning on the
job to be able to put these
energy efficiency products and
services in in motion it really
wanted to insure that we have
data we can measure of the
effectiveness of this project
and we need to ensure that their
project budget the underserved
community.
Of health benefits and and and
energy budget.
So Mister speaker gentle lady
with respect to the specific
equipment processes.
Or procedures to that would
result in this.
Senator GA yes introduction.
Specifications and more
restriction on port.
A.
The actual store and stole his
current.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman you know as long as
those drugs reduce the energy
burden on it it's really up to
the the local governments to
work with the community and the
community partners to determine
what those products are.
Mr speaker and gentle lady this
could be a.
Hi a motion see.
Lucien American national systems
could be no higher efficiency
refrigerators washers dryers
handlers.
The
installation.
Solution could be.
Or of the.
For this program is that correct
Mr speaker gentleman yes that is
correct.
The gentle lady is there any
specific qualification for the
household to be eligible for
this program for services.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman there are
qualifications the of the units
the.
The household have to be low
income for the folks that have
to be living in affordable
housing.
Mr speaker gentle lady for a
definition for me of hello New
Mexico.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman for the purposes of
this program low income is
defined as defined as two
hundred percent of the federal
poverty rate.
Soon Mr speaker gentle lady that
would be a plus or minus fifty
thousand dollars a year.
Mr speaker gentleman it depends
on the family size for a family
four fifty three thousand
dollars a year.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Things did.
With respect to.
The qualifications.
Thanks to choose I would like to
introduce us.
One.
Past performance serving as.
One of.
Portions of the amendment.
And I would like to request a
roll call vote that's fine I
believe it's been passed down
would you give us the to to
number.
Gentleman from Chavis to wish to
make a point where.
Mary said that was fine okay so
we have we have would you please
do that to to number.
From the total number is two
two four zero nine point one
eight gentleman has moved the
amendment and other down to
explain.
Mr speaker.
very simple amendment.
Important is required that the
law.
To to
put up a five percent of the
total project request as
matching funds.
Gentlelady from house is this a
friendly amendment Mr speaker it
is not.
Okay is there debate on the
amendment.
Hearing none the we will have a
roll call vote of dumb Chavis at
in terra thank you Mr speaker
will the gentleman yield.
The gentleman from Chavis.
Speaker and gentleman can you
explain to the body the reason
you brought this forward I mean
what benefits do believe it
brings to the process.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
I believe fifteen.
Dollars to the budget
to accommodate these.
Efficiency programs and
encouragement this legislation
four corners absolutely most of
the game for those local
entities and kind of a wide
range of projects and equipment.
Inviolable try these households.
It would
prevent local to try to have
just a little bit of skin in the
game.
All for sure not sure but
taxpayers.
These are being.
Expand.
Mr speaker and gentleman five
percent of fifteen million seven
hundred fifty thousand dollars
is that right.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
There is.
The
amount of the grant award to the
individual committee your
governmental entity and
therefore no one.
To the expenditures that could
go to page virtual console as a
consequence.
But if the whole Mr speaker and
gentleman if the whole fifteen
million dollars was utilized.
Then all of the communities
collectively.
What have
a five percent match of the
total is that correct.
Gentleman that is exactly
correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman I.
I think most communities that
were interested in helping their
seniors.
for those that needed energy
efficiency
Programs would jump on that and
so.
Speaker and gentleman I
I believe we have the broader
reasonable amendment and
I wished it had been viewed as
being friendly thank you Mr
speaker and gentleman.
Gentleman from Bernalillo Santa
Fe towards Valencia.
Thank you Mr speaker this is the
gentleman yield.
The gentleman from Santa Fe
County this is the chairman of
five percent match.
Of four local community is is as
I understand this local
community is required to put up
a five percent match is that
correct.
Gentleman that is exactly
correct Mr speaker German the
CEO about how much that would be
for a local community.
Contingent upon.
Yes it is if it was of course
local community would have to
come up with fifty thousand five
hundred thousand dollars twenty
five thousand it's a strict
percentage of request.
This is the chairman
In my day job I work with some
federal programs are required
local match.
Local maps routinely defeats the
federal program.
That is there of federal dollars
that don't come to our state
because the local communities
cannot match those dollars in Mr
speaker gentleman I guarantee
you the same result will happen
here the our communities will be
shut out of this program because
they won't be able to come up
with the match.
This is just the a stumbling
block for the local communities.
So I can for this.
Thank you Mr speaker Dylan.
The gentleman from Bernalillo

Representative Dow.
Thank you Mr speaker with
agility else that thank you Mr
yes I yield thank you very thank
you very much and Mr speaker and
gentle lady
You in the very very first part
the section of the act to talk
about allowing the New Mexico
finance authority to apply for
community energy efficiency
development block grants is that
something that exists in the
federal level.
Mr speaker gentle lady that's
the mortgage finance authority.
Mr speaker Julie I'm sorry yes.
Mr speaker gentle lady yes the
MFA does apply for grants at the
federal level as well.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady and who is currently
applying for those in New
Mexico.
Mr speaker gentle lady I'm not
sure I understand your question
you in terms of the Mr speaker
gentle lady the program exists
the federal dollars exist who is
currently at eligible in New
Mexico to apply for them now.
Mr speaker gentle lady are this
program does not exist right now
we're creating this program
gentle lady Mr speaker thank you
Mr speaker gentle lady does the
community energy efficiency
development block grant exist at
the federal level.
Mr speaker gentle lady it does
not thank you Mr speaker thank
you gentle lady
on page two on on line fourteen
you talk about community
partners is defined as an
organization that provides
services are outreach to an
underserved community to
implement a community inner
energy efficiency project
it does not define if they are
for profit not for profit you so
could any any
partner any community partner is
is the any organization and what
type of formation is
organization have to meets Mr
speaker gentle lady it's really
up to the local government what
kind of partnership they want to
have.
So any organization can apply Mr
speaker gentle lady what is the
definition of an organization.
Mr speaker gentle lady you know.
What we really want is for
someone who has experience in
who's on the ground doing this
kind of work to be working with
the local government.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
typically will see something
like a fiber one C. three a for
profit so this is just didn't
the local community will define
what an organization as.
The local Mr speaker gentle lady
the local community will work
with the five oh one see three
or an LLC or nonprofit a
nonprofit for profit business
thank you Mr speaker.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
so.
Community partner means any
organization.
Mr speaker gentle lady yes.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentle lady on page three on
line seven under section page.
Registered apprenticeship
program that promotes diversity
means an apprenticeship program
register for to it pursuant to
the apprenticeship assistance
act that encourages diversity
among participants participation
by those under represented in
the industry associated with the
purchase of program efforts as
using participation from
disadvantaged communities as
determined by the workforce
solutions department.
Could you please Mr speaker
gentle lady to provide for me
what registered apprenticeship
programs are approved.
By the participants into the
act.
Mr speaker gentle lady we don't
have a list of those but it is a
it's part of the election at the
eligibility criteria.
Thank you Mr speaker and a lady
can you tell me who's excluded
from the apprentice a sentence
assistance act.
Mr speaker gentle lady I I
cannot tell you that.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady I don't know if you
were familiar with we received
quite a substantial amount of
federal dollars that flew
through the state or sometimes
in some cases went directly to
the school districts to work on
the the air filtration systems
and this language was inserted
by a state representative and we
found out that there was only
like six program six provider
statewide that can meet the need
of eighty seven school districts
and at more than eighty seven
school districts and charter
schools.
It it seems to me that this
would be a really really
important thing to know when
we're passing a bill that
limits.
That you have to be part of the
registered apprenticeship
program.
As one of the eligibility
requirements do it but you don't
know how many there are verses
the need.
Mr speaker gentle lady it's part
of the selection criteria you
don't have to use an
apprenticeship program.
Mr speaker and gentle lady then
why is this language here.
Mr speaker gentle lady
it's a recommendation it's part
of the selection criteria they
did it's not required for
you know for that local
government to work with an
entity that's part of this
program Mr speaker and gentle
lady but on page twelve.
When you set out the criteria
for the selection of the
community energy efficiency
projects you're being very
specific about what I believe
will become a request for
application or request for
proposal but you're not putting
any weight on here so your this
appears to me to be open to the
termination of the person who
drafts the RFP to this to decide
the weight of the apprenticeship
programs what talk about on page
twelve on one fifth line fifteen
number four.
Mr speaker gentle lady if you
see on that page actually page
twelve you'll see that the the
department which has not set out
its rulemaking at which will
happen later shall consider
these requirements Mr speaker
and gentle lady it's been my
experience we task them with
considering it we leave it up to
them to determine the rulemaking
we don't get to say and your
intention maybe and I believe
that it is for this to be
available for every community
particularly those that are
underserved well I can talk
about my district grant Hidalgo
in Sierra County where we don't
have a printer programs not a
single one in all three counties
but we do have a local folks who
are approved and licensed by C.
ID could implement these
projects but if we are not
specific about the percentage or
the weight of the application.
They will be excluded from
participation and they're not
enough apprenticeship programs
in the state to be able to do
the projects on their own.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
Is there a reason why you didn't
decide how important it was for
them to consider this.
Mr speaker gentle lady it's
really important that the local
government have the flexibility
to develop the program on its
own sometimes it's it's an
apprenticeship program that
they'll be working with and
sometimes it's paid internships
that's all part of the package
that they put together to apply
for funding from from energy
thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady so you already know
what the application process is
going to look like.
Mr speaker gentle lady I I don't
actually it has not we have to
pass this bill we haven't gone
through real through rulemaking
but in in the bill right now we.
It says that that the the the
program can find paid
internships to persons from the
targeted underserved
communities.
Mr speaker and gentle lady let
me just go ahead and read the
entire park if you are reading
part of it but starting on page
twelve the talk about new
material selection of community
efficiency projects.
And and then your prescribing
how the point system our
priorities will be delivered.
And number.
Line fifteen number four says
whether the application that
they are to consider whether the
application includes a
commitment by a service provider
community partner to employ
apprentices from a registered
apprenticeship program that
promotes diversity or to find
paid internships to persons from
a targeted underserved community
madam chair you're not giving a
particular weight so we don't
know if this can become
prohibited especially in rural
under served areas this can
become a barrier if not.
If we don't put a weight on it.
Mr speaker gentle lady there is
no point system right now and I
want to be clear when we were
writing this language we wanted
to make sure that the like in
your community gentle lady Mr
speaker there there may not be
an apprenticeship program but
there sure are people who would
like to work and they could get
a paid internship to to help the
low income families in your
community that's how this rates
thank you Mr speaker Mr speaker
and gentle lady that's one way
to interpret how this reads but
another person could interpret
it and maybe those doing the
rulemaking and those creating
the application process could
also interpreted to say that
your prioritizing applications
that include a commitment by the
service provider to employ
apprentices from the registered
apprenticeship program and that
promotes diversity or to find
paid internships to person from
a target underserved communities
and is that correct.
Mr speaker gentle lady I think
it's important to note that this
bill has not passed yet and and
we I think it when it comes time
for rulemaking that's when we
should ensure that we make these
kinds of comments.
Mr speaker and gentle lady but
many many times as we're going
through you'll see bills coming
through and I'll say five point
priority for veterans business
five point priority for a women
owned or operated business five
point priority for an
underserved area and and they
were at an area where there's
justified need and they put in
the very specific criteria as
ambiguous as this is a once a
bill passed trust me because I
passed bills before and didn't
recognize the implementation.
So madam Mister chair Mister
speaker and madam.
These are there's no there's no
criteria that would prevent that
from being over weighted and
exclude folks in small
communities these are these are
often small businesses.
Mr speaker and Madam.
I was there any discussion in
the committee process of
amending the section of
language.
Mr speaker gentle lady there was
not thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady it's the first time I've
seen as so it's new to me.
Just a minute Mr speaker.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I'd
like to move an amendment.
Okay.
Okay it's been passed down its
hand written amendments so we
don't have any two oh two number
the gentle lady would you at
this point.
Thank you Mr speaker I move the
house floor amendment one to
house bill thirty seven of.
What I say I move this okay.
The jelly roll call vote yes we
already have that gentlelady to
explain the mentor thank you Mr
speaker and thank you gentle
lady and so basically what I'm
doing here is on page three.
Strike line seven through
thirteen and re letter
accordingly on page eight line I
had the word and after the
semicolon.
Age eight strike lines six
through ten and remember
accordingly.
I believe.
Mr speaker make sure this is the
moment I want one.
Mr speaker this is not a
complete amendment.
Can I.
You wanna moved other speakers
on the bill and I can get them
and it right I I'm sorry I just
read the bill this morning I was
prepared for this but this is a.
What what I'm looking at Mr
speaker and gentle lady is the
fact that if this language is
present this could be
prohibitive funding being
equally applied across the state
Mr speaker the gentle lady
cannot name the number of
eligible apprenticeship programs
that are approved by this agency
and I do not want any community
excluded because they do not
have that apprenticeship
program.
So I need to this ammendment is
that correct.
The need to withdraw.
And will I be able to come back.
Well it depends how long the
debate goes I mean you have to
for now.
Mr speaker I might tune with
giving up the four.
Yes Mr speaker I'd like to
withdraw money in the okay the
there's further debate the
gentleman Dona Ana
representative of our.
Before generated by projects
this is a good reminder of what
we try to do in the sixty day
session which is you know I've
I've taken the course of
announcing in advance the bills
are going to be heard which
gives every member an
opportunity and to spend more
than sufficient time to go to
Council Service have amendments
drafted.
With the two oh two numbers so
that this doesn't happen that's
the reason that I know it's the
bills before hand so that if
there are amendment city to be
drafted members have ample
opportunity to work with council
service that we are sure to get
the equipment.
Traffic correctly I think I told
everyone this will be the first
bill on the agenda yesterday so
and I.
Thank you Mr speaker I these do
use the council service
they can make sure you give me a
straight thank thank you Mr
speaker that was less than
twenty four hours ago and I had
other commitments and I don't
need a man's thank you for the
opportunity to come back at a
later time thank you for.
Gentleman from you thank you Mr
speaker will generally be able
to.
Thank you Mr speaker yes I will
yield to the gentleman gentle
lady are I am I have a couple of
questions regarding this bill.
Four to a what prompted this
legislation what what needs are
we addressing with this bill.
Mr speaker and gentleman of.
So many low income New Mexicans
are paying so much money for
their utility bills we've heard
on average it's fifteen percent
of their income.
Of every month goes to their
utility bills in some counties
catching County tells County
Roosevelt County it's up over
twenty percent okay so that so
these families are over burdened
and part of the problem is that
there is the place is that if
they live in have inefficient
heating systems and cooling
systems there appliances are old
and not very efficient so their
energy put their energy bills
are high so what this bill does
is is addresses this problem a
probe is problem and I I believe
a really elegant way we have
whether Zetian programs at MSA
their whole house retrofits
whole house with the
reservations this is very
specific it's very targeted its
geographic it means a local
government or a tribe can say
Hey you know my community really
doesn't have insulation we need
that and so together they work
with the community partner to
apply for these funds and they
make their their low income
neighbors houses close the
inefficient and what results in
is lower utility bills and that
money can be used for rent car
payments goes right back into
the community Mr speaker thank
you for that question thank
thank you Mr speaker generally I
understand that because there's
many of many many people in
order for rural communities
especially use propane and
that's very very expensive and
we can get energy efficient
appliances insulation you know
windows and things of things of
that nature install in their
homes in the state of a lot of
money is what I would really
hate to see Mr speaker gentle
lady is people having to choose
whether they're going to grow by
groceries over the gonna buy
prescriptions and pay utility
bills so this is very important
so Mr speaker Donnelly of all
these of all these applicants
you know we're we we you
mentioned low income families.
Would senior citizens also be
eligible to apply for this grant
Mr speaker and gentleman State
absolutely at the local
government for the tribal work
with senior citizens to make
sure that they're included as
part of as part of the project
application.
Thank you thank you for that Mr
speaker gentle lady so the these
funds are going to local
governments say the county or
municipality
the these organizations have
the county accountability
measures built into processes do
they not Mr the only Mr speaker
gentleman they do.
And then Mr speaker gentle lady
these accountability appropriate
procedures what you know
include some type of oversight
either by the the city council
for the county commission to do
to do and approve such things Mr
speaker ma'am gently.
Mr speaker and gentleman give me
just a second.
Mr speaker gentleman section
four of the bill that's on page
six outlines all the
requirements for applying but
there is there is oversight
you know you have to make sure
that you are collecting data us
and so that you can measure the
success of a of a project and I
want to be very clear Mr speaker
gentleman.
Only those units were low income
families are living at that two
hundred percent poverty level
for those units that are that
are affordable housing units are
allowed to receive this kind of
benefit from this program.
Thank thank you for that only
the Mr speaker I have a another
question in this so it was just
it goes up to the process and
and businesses contractors are
are identified to be to do this
Mr speaker gentle lady the these
contractors are going to go out
and purchase before they can
purchase these materials and and
this equipment to to to to
improve these homes.
Mr speaker gentleman at there's
no requirement on where they the
purchase the equipment.
But they said purchase them from
their local community.
That that would be my of my
preference Mr speaker German
thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
and that that's exactly my point
is that they're gonna go back to
the committee and purchase these
things from from local
businesses and it'll contribute
to the tax rates as well and I
think it's really important
because what we need to do is to
not only look at taking care of
some of our morals more
vulnerable citizens in the
community but this bill also has
a certain level of
I guess I economic impact
positively to the economic
impact of the to the local
community and I also I think
that's a very big plus that we
really haven't talked about is
the economic benefit of this
program.
Thank you Mr speaker gentleman
there is significant economic
impacts not only with the
purchase of potential point of
purchase of supplies but I think
most importantly the the jobs
the those local jobs that will
you know the young people who
can be hired to do this kind of
working community.
It could only be madam speaker
and that's a I think that's
something that we really should
consider as well and when
considering the this bill Madam
speaker gentle lady you have my
full support on this bill I
think it's a great idea and I
know I will put the heavily
promoted in my area thank you
madam speaker think it's only.
There's further debate thank you
gentleman on the gentleman from
San Juan Representative Eli.
Thank you madam speaker minister
with the generated from task on
the yield thank you thank you
madam speaker I yield to the
gentleman transfigured
gentlelady from Giles every
question on page three that
same.
definition age that kind of set
off the fireworks earlier where
it defines a registered
apprenticeship program.
That promotes diversity.
madam chair gentle lady from
tell subject can you show me
where in the bill the word
diversity is defined.
Madam speaker and gentleman it
is not defined in the bill.
Mr gentle lady.
This criteria.
Of diversely though is is
required as part of both the
application.
And as well as the criteria to
be selected Madam chair gentle
lady from house is that correct.
Mr Madam speaker a gentleman it
is not required.
Madam speaker generated from
tell us this war diversity is
required to be on the
application and is also for the
criteria for selection is that
correct.
Madam speaker gentleman that is
not working that is not correct.
Madam speaker gentle lady.
We were then turned to.
The minister Ginnelly please
turn to page three further
update.
Institutional investor let me
know when you're there.
Madam speaker and gentleman I am
on page three there is no
paragraph eight.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
tells page eight of eight excuse
me.
Madam speaker and gentleman I'm
there.
Administered generated from
tells.
This provision set forth what an
applicant should include is that
correct.
Madam speaker German yes Madam
speaker gently different house
does it say that they have to
include the registered
apprenticeship program that
promotes diversity.
Madam speaker and gentleman for
a paid internship.
Two persons from the targeted
underserved community.
Minister gentlelady from Giles
does it say that they have to
find information program from a
registered financial issues may
register pressure program that
promotes diversity.
Madam speaker gentleman
You have to say if you're going
to do that in the application
but you were not required.
To do that to apply for this
program.
And madam speaker gentle lady
please look at the page twelve
program for.
Spencer gentlelady from house of
the prime time let me know when
you're there.
Madam speaker and gentleman I am
their master gentility for House
so this I believe is looking at
what the department shall
consider when making an award is
that correct.
Madam speaker gentleman yes.
And minister Joanne from Giles
it's not optional.
And I understand it correctly
they must consider these items.
Madam speaker gentleman's in
section four and.
In paragraph forces whether the
application includes a
commitment.
So madam speaker Julie from
thousand sorry I'm I'm talking
about before we get to the
specifics of program from
talking about.
Does.
This bill mandate what the
department shall consider when
making award.
Madam speaker gentlemen yes
these.
These are the things that shall
be considered.
And madam speaker generated from
Giles one of those is a
registered apprenticeship
program that promotes diversity
or provides paid internships is
that correct.
Madam speaker gentleman's yes.
Madam speaker gentle lady it
seems to me and and I hope the
correct me if I'm wrong but it
seems to me that.
This concept of diversity is
important for an applicant to be
successful in getting one of
these awards.
Madam speaker gentleman eight.
The way this is written any
community can.
Use the register program for
higher rate pay get paid
internships to folks from their
local community to do this
really important work.
Madam speaker gently from Giles
is it is it helpful for an
applicant to to promote
diversity the way the bills
written.
Madam speaker and and gentleman
I think what is helpful is if we
are able to get dollars out the
door to local hires.
Madam speaker generated from
houses it helpful for an
applicant to promote diversity
in order to receive a grant
under this program.
Madam speaker gentleman's SB
what we're saying here is that
you can either have an
apprenticeship program or you
can pay someone locally through
paid internships so either of
those things are helpful and
it's likely that there will be a
diversity of of applicants for
the paid internship.
Madam speaker gentle lady.
The the word diversity what what
does that mean since the bill
doesn't provide.
Madam speaker gentleman that
diversity is defined in the.
Hold on a second we're getting
there.
Apprenticeship assistance act.
Minister General can I get a
citation that please.
Madam speaker gentleman that
might take a moment.
And then figure join from tell
us why you're why you're looking
for that can you point me where
in the bill and it references
that specific act madam speaker
gentleman it's on page three.
Line nine.
That madam speaker gentleman we
we don't have that number.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
thousands twenty one to nineteen
eighty to nineteen a desperate.
Thank you madam speaker German.
gentle lady from palace that's
the definitional section I don't
see the word diversity included.
Chairman you have a question.
Mr digitally for Taos I'm just
trying to understand what the
word adversely means of this
bill is not defined this bill I
was cited to
The partnership assistance a
back to back does not have the
word diversity to provide some
just understand what does that
word mean.
Madam chairman I think we have a
pretty good understanding of
what diversity means.
I think I want to just point out
again that that.
In this but if you're applying
for this program you can use one
of those two criteria is either
your.
Applying for an apprenticeship.
That you're you're going to be
hiring a principal that
apprentices or you're gonna be
hiring local folks to the paid
internship.
Massacre lady from Giles is
diversity race based.
Madam speaker and gentleman
diversity can be Geographic
gender racial ethnic there's all
kinds of sexual orientation
there was all kinds of
diversity.
So madam speaker gently from
Charleston this definition of
diversity then is not defined in
relation to maybe the merits of
the person actually perform the
work.
External characteristics is that
correct.
Madam speaker gentleman the
company can define what
diversity means to that company
if they're part of the
apprenticeship program as part
of an application from a local
government for funds.
There's been a request for the
gentle in terms of their jackets
seeing no opposition Democrat go
head with the jackets thank you.
Thank you madam speaker
gentlelady from trial so.
I know that the word diverse is
not defined bill.
I was pointed to the prince of
friendship assistance act has a
definition that doesn't contain
the definition.
And now I'm being told the
individual companies can define
the word diversity and madam
speaker that concerns me greatly
because if it's that subjective.
And we're making a helpful
criteria in order for me to be
awarded one of these requests.
With taxpayer dollars I'm
concerned.
The subjective nature of that
and I also express that I I have
concerns when we start
allocating.
These dollars to private
companies.
Based on external
characteristics not related to
their ability to necessarily
perform the work I I I take
issue with that as well I think
I've made my point with the word
diversity and all also down
thank you madam speaker.
There's further debate the
gentleman from San Juan
Representative Montoya.
Thank you madam chair them
speaker does the gentle lady
from telesales madam speaker I
yield to the gentleman from
someone.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady my questions also us
surround the.
The apprenticeship Act
Madam speaker and gentle lady
the concern there is
The choice is between hiring
from a company that has a in the
in the act that was passed I
believe was that last year the
apprenticeship Act there is
there are specific criteria for
that to be a qualified
apprenticeship program it's very
expensive.
so madam speaker and gentle lady
I would dare say that any of
your local companies that are
builders would not qualify and
madam speaker and gentle lady hi
in the last year have taken over
the responsibility of being a
business manager for a
construction company.
Madam speaker gentle lady.
I know that the effort here
Madam speaker gentle lady is to.
Try and find affordable housing.
The problem with the
apprenticeship backed madam
speaker and gentle lady is the
added cost.
The cost right now the people
who currently have.
these apprenticeship programs in
place I believe there eight
companies and they all out of
Albuquerque.
So madam speaker and gentle lady
the option is to do that for.
The higher the go through what
the qualifications of the
friendship that are for everyone
else to go and hire apprentices
but you can't just hire someone
and to for like you're saying
with the word diversity each
company can define the word
diversity the madam speaker and
gentle lady we cannot define the
word apprentice.
The sounds very generic madam
speaker and gentle lady but the
word apprentice in this what it
would have to he would have to
put in place an apprenticeship
program that those eight
companies in Albuquerque already
have so madam speaker and gentle
lady if the purpose of this
legislation is to provide
affordable housing.
This.
Would not do that and madam
speaker gentle lady if we're
going to tap the funds in the
mortgage finance the authority.
If we're going to tap those
funds then this is going to make
those funds dwindle much more
rapidly if they qualify for this
semester and gentle lady I don't
believe that your intent we've
had conversations about speaker
and the New Delhi from tells
about affordable housing and
madam speaker this section.
Will not do that as a matter of
fact the only all this would do
Madam speaker and gentle lady is
subsidized out of the minimal
amount of funds that exist at
the mortgage cap of finance
authority to pay essentially you
scale.
That's what will happen with
that apprenticeship Act.
And so madam speaker and gentle
lady I've talked to our company
provides.
the type of housing that is
renewable it is energy efficient
is the exact type of of
materials that you would need to
help a with exactly what you're
talking about a massacre
gentlelady.
Companies like mine I would I
would say probably companies
like
Representative Castellano we
wouldn't even did for these jobs
if this is the requirement
because the apprenticeship Act
Madam speaker and gentle lady is
very expensive and it is meant
to be Madam speaker gentle lady
that was a you pushed bill that
came through here and it was
passed and it was meant the act
itself was meant to lock out the
small companies I do not believe
this budget madam speaker and
gentle lady all of our small
communities it only benefits the
large companies out of
Albuquerque because everyone
else would not be able to comply
so madam speaker gentle lady I
would suggest your bill would
not be hurt at all by removing
the sections that Representative
Dow is suggesting if your intent
is to try and have those local
companies provide this work in
each of these communities.
But if if if these this language
is not struck from this.
This once again very much of
will weigh in the advantage of
large companies who don't need
this business in the first place
so madam speaker gentle lady
sometimes we can't.
All of our priorities into a
bill sometimes in a bill like
this you guys are gonna have to
be excluded if you're wanting it
to be affordable Madam speaker
and gentle lady while most of
the companies that are small.
Have already have their
employees that have all that.
Frankly of the we've trained
them.
We we spend money to train them
we can't afford to then go out
and put in place.
This expensive.
Type of of language for
partnership cements bigger
generated I would hope this
would be a a friend the friendly
amendment on Representative Dow
brings it back to you because.
I'm just letting you know from
someone who knows this from the
construction side.
This would mean the majority of
companies in each of our
communities would not be able to
comply so I something would need
to happen to this language as it
as it is described here it does
say shall.
And this is shall be considered
so that means there's a point
system so madam speaker and
gentle lady.
However puts this point system
in place.
If they believe that is a very
very heavy point.
Then it's going to favor.
Companies out of Albuquerque it
becomes very expensive to travel
and put people up in hotels to
pay for travel back and forth it
will take it will take.
The funds the minimal funds that
exist in the mortgage finance
authority and divert them to X.
more much much more expensive
companies out of Albuquerque and
madam speaker and generally they
have a lot of overhead the
smaller companies are able to
survive because they don't have
a lot of overhead but it also
means that a speaker and gentle
lady the the type of
apprenticeship program that is
dictated here.
Is very exclusive so madam
speaker and gentle lady I would
urge the body if you are
concerned about the for the
housing in your communities and
if you like the general concept
of this bill which is meant to
help communities find a way to
get grant money into their
communities.
For affordable housing.
I I believe it's it's in your
best interest to not pass this
bill as written because it will
exclude your neighborhood.
Contractors so thank you madam
speaker.
There's further debate the
gentleman will curry of
Representative Crowder.
Thank you madam speaker will the
provided to us please yield and
speaker I yield to the gentleman
from curry thank you July July I
get my first question is is a
real basic how is this block
grants act going to be funded
have four of the money come
from.
Madam speaker at gentleman we
just passed a transformational
budget bill I just a few days
ago and there there is funding
in the budget for energy
efficiency programs.
Madam speaker gentle lady on I'm
sorry can you tell me how much
money is in there for this.
Madam speaker and gentleman I
believe there's fifteen million.
Okay thank you gently gently I
guess the reason I I kind of
struggle this I had an energy
efficient company for many many
years and we didn't use a dime
of government money.
If you look on the bottom of
your utility bill.
There's a little fee charge for
cost recovery for energy
efficiency I work for Xcel
energy.
And we did
Energy efficiency we had to
prove it we're done we had to do
it board or yes we had to do a
dock last yes we had to make
sure that we created the inner
fish energy efficiency or we
don't get a check.
But we did houses all over the
eastern side of the state there
are companies out of Albuquerque
that did the same thing we I
went into all the houses low
income houses big houses we did
a mall for years.
Then use a dime.
Of the state's money or this
type grant money.
But under your bill that company
the company that I had.
Could not we were not
an apprenticeship of approved
program that we would not have
been able to do that nor would
all the people have worked under
that process by Xcel energy.
And so I'm concerned that if
this passes.
It's actually going to cost low
income people money instead of
saving money it it just it
doesn't make sense to me to
create a new program I know
your your motives are good your
heart tried.
But I don't know that you
considered that that services
out there for free to anyone
that would call we would provide
the service.
Excel would pass if we were
successful.
It worked wonderfully self
by the way the the cost recovery
program.
Is under sixty two to seventeen
dash six was affected back in
nineteen and it is
It's a good way to get energy
efficiency without going through
a program.
You can use all your local
people to do it if you can get
in in touch with Xcel energy I
think PNM had a similar program
what exactly the same.
But I I struggle with what
you're trying to do is being
cost effective I.
I don't see it as being the
right tool so I appreciate what
you're doing what your heart is
but I think I think the the
process is misguided compared to
what's out there and available
thank you madam speaker there's
further debate the gentleman
from Bernalillo Santa Fe
Torrance and the ones here
Representative McQueen.
Thank you madam speaker madam
speaker gentle lady does the
daily deal and speaker and
gentleman from all those
counties I do you.
Thank you gentle lady Madam
speaker deli I I'm
We heard this bill and house
energy
In the debate here on the floor
has a bit of a different a
focus.
In Madam speaker jelly of like
to get some clarification on
some of the language in the
bill.
Mr jelly this language has been
highlighted by other speakers
but all director attention to.
page eight line six.
Mr chairman and there.
Madam speaker of the jelly
discovered any.
Suggest that
that is required or does it
suggest list the item if
present.
Madam speaker and gentleman it's
a possibility.
Madam speaker gentle lady
especially in the in this for
efforts
the end of a war the.
So you can have a or B..
Madam speaker gentle lady
because that pulls because of
neither is that correct Madam
speaker gentle lady Mr Chairman
yes you are correct.
Madam speaker deli on page
twelve.
On lines five and six it says
ring reviewing these
applications the shell consider.
That's a mandatory but then
again in lines eighteen and
nineteen.
is the online nineteen.
Centers and for is there not.
Madam speaker and gentleman that
is on line eighteen.
I'm sorry but budget secretary
Lisa on fifteen there's a
weather whether you have these
that with you have a or the is
that correct.
Madam speaker gentleman you're
correct.
Speaker gentle lady.
I I hear the debate but there
seems to be a misconception that
an apprentice program program is
required.
To be eligible for these funds.
Mexicans LED is that accurate.
Madam gentleman you can do an
apprenticeship program or you
can hire folks to have paid
internships.
You can do neither.
So madam speaker gentle lady is
yes or no is an apprentice
program required to be eligible
for the funds Mexico domino's.
The lady.
I appreciate the the.
The provide flexibility if in
the press program is not present
in the community.
I think providing paid
internships teaching young
people a trade.
Is a great thing and so we're
here we are Mr jelly we have a
bill that invests in lowincome
communities and low incomes
houses in low income homes are
also using this program.
To help.
Find jobs to help provide
training you know hopefully this
is Leo Messi are generally you
an internship.
Because it's a trade or business
you want to go into.
And so it's an opportunity to
learn it's an opportunity to
provide to demonstrate your
abilities it's an opportunity to
really get a job to develop a
career.
Then speaker gentle lady I I'm
confused by the.
The severe hostility to this I
think the bill as written.
By creating incentives and great
flexibility.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady.
There's further debate the
gentle lady from Chavez
Representative Ezzell.
Thank you madam speaker will the
lady from tell she'll please
madam speaker I yield to the
gentle lady from.
That County.
This with an S. M. speaker
gentle lady from Travis thank
you.
Madam speaker gentle lady thank
you very much to have concerns
of over this there is no
hostility.
Coming from the side of the
aisle I do want to point that
out the one of we're talking
about apprenticeships to me that
is very very important.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
from tells.
Of just a point to help my
concern over the friendship part
of it.
For a person to be.
Eligible to be an engineer they
have to study for years after
they do receive their degree
under a licensed engineer before
they can go ahead and have
completion of this I understand
also let's say a plumber and
electrician they have to follow
the same guidelines.
Of as far as construction the
construction industry division
will tell you also that there
are guidelines that have to be
met before a person can become
in the Preakness.
Madam speaker hold on just one
minute I don't want to get to
that by the speaker I hear
strategist came off hold on.
I would take it off madam
speaker but I know that I would
get to that.
So madam speaker whenever we are
talking about the print ships
part of it I understand the need
to teach our younger generation.
That there are jobs in our state
but there are certain criteria
that has to be met before they
can fill those roles.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
are you familiar with the
lie he program.
Madam speaker gentle lady I am.
Madam speaker gentle lady for
those people that don't know for
the light he stands for it
stands for.
Low income home energy
assistance program and madam
speaker gentle lady whenever I
go to discussing that.
Our local rural electric
cooperatives located throughout
the state.
The ones that are responsible
for.
Lighting up rural New Mexico.
They have been instrumental in
helping these homes as far as
being able to make studies homes
more energy efficient by
providing low cost or no cost
water heaters.
Working stoves home heating
apparatuses and so madam speaker
gentle lady.
Thirteen of your bill.
Starting on line twenty one.
Members seem to is states loan
reduce energy burden on low
income persons with or.
Outside of the inner surface
community would not be likely to
New River otherwise receive
energy efficiency.
Permits through other state
programs.
Can you tell me what any other
state programs there are that
now falls that are now equipped
to handle what that particular
section is stating.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
there is a whole house weather
is ation program at MFA
this is is not that problem
excuse me this this is not that
program and that program is very
effective it's successful it's
also hard to get into about two
thousand families on that wait
list as far as I understand it
there are something like twenty
six states that have weather is
ation and energy efficiency
programs.
Not dissimilar to this part of
this program that we're
proposing here we do we do not
have this very specific targeted
energy efficiency program yes
that's what we hope to do here
then speaker gentle lady.
Madam speaker and gentle lady I
appreciate the intent of what
you're trying to do here.
Right now in the state of New
Mexico due to the Corona virus
and the implications that have
come from this that has hit our
state pretty dang hard.
We have people that don't want
to work so how are you going to
say.
We want you to work.
Whenever they don't understand
that this apprenticeship may be
years in the making how are you
going to force these people to
be able to fall in there and do
the work that's my concern right
now we have businesses not only
in the rural areas but in a more
metropolitan areas for the
these businesses are struggling
toward.
To stay in business because
people don't want to work Madam
speaker gentle lady tell me how
this is going to play out.
Madam speaker gentle lady
We're not forcing anyone to work
I I know people in my community
who want to work.
They want to work they they want
to work a good job getting paid
well to help their community so
how I see this playing out is a
local government identifies a
partner that they want to work
with whether it's a business or
nonprofit or
I don't know program like Rocky
Mount use court one of them many
used cars all around our state
and they they all work together
to identify the folks the houses
the people who qualify for these
for these funds for this program
and start doing the good work.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
from Taos that is unlike your
passion on this bill.
Madam speaker whenever we as a
state or as of federal
government make it easier for
people not to work.
We still have a problem there
Madam speaker gentle lady on
page fourteen.
Section seven AA.
This is that the community
energy efficiency develop a
block grant Fund is created as a
non reverting fund in the state
treasury I'm also reading that
the.
ten million dollars has been
appropriated in house bill two.
For funds for this program.
Madam speaker and gentle lady.
What happens whenever those
funds are depleted I understand
reading your bill that gives can
be made other appropriations can
be made.
But is this going to be a
continual.
For ever and ever is there an
end date to this.
Madam speaker gentle lady we
have so many people in need
I and I'm hopeful that we can do
the work of bringing in funds
from the federal level from of
foundations state funds whatever
funds that we can get to support
this program to support those in
need I I think if we
If we could we'd we'd fully
funded with as much as we could
to get those boots on the ground
replacing old appliances to do
in the work of of reducing the
energy burden for for lowincome
New Mexicans.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
from tells.
Right now I live in the
southeastern corner of the
state.
And I can't tell you the number
of millions and millions and
millions of dollars that that
area of the state has sent up
here to oil and gas.
And fruit farming and ranching.
And right now there are people
out there intent on doing away.
This killing the golden goose
doing away with the oil and gas
industry.
They can get tougher with more
regulations on the agricultural
industry.
And that is what funds are state
madam chair Madam speaker and
gentle lady.
We are seeing that this state is
going to be green by a certain
year and that does mean wind
turbines and it does mean solar
so with these particular
communities located for our of
our state that are going green.
And actually it's not green
madam speaker because the tons
and tons and tons of plastic of
copper and of oil that it does
take to run these turbines.
With the.
Landfills being filled up with
spent.
Solar panels broken solar
panels.
But yet we're still.
Going to see.
That we are going to be
requesting this into perpetuity
that gives me great concern
madam chair Madam speaker and
gentle lady.
Like I said earlier the intent
of this is really good I am
bothered by the apprentice part
of it.
I do want people to go to work.
That before they go in the home
they do have to have training
that can take a long time.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
promoting to a graphic
diversity.
I would like more.
Clarity on that particular
sentence which does happen on
page thirteen line nineteen can
you tell me what you mean by
geographic diversity.
Then speaker gentle lady at
that's an excellent question but
we want to make sure is that all
areas of the state have access
to these funds that it's not
just one particular county that
has the capability of writing a
really good grant but all areas
of the state including yours
mine.
Madam speaker gentle lady when
they were talking about having
all areas of the state being
able to participate in that I
understand that but ultimately
who is going to make the
decision on where these.
Ends are going to be expanded.
Madam speaker gentle lady that
that decision we made in the
rulemaking process and the EMNRD
is the agency that will be.
Defining that that will making
process Madam speaker gentle
lady from tell us whenever we
are talking about and we're.
Making the decision on where
these projects are going to take
place because it does federal
under the state guidelines is it
going to have to be.
You.
Entity that does the work
because then when you are I
don't know but think about all
this apprenticeship that you
have listed in your bill.
Madam speaker gentle lady that's
not required any local
government can work with the
local business or nonprofit to
hire someone as a rate under a
rate it internship.
Madam speaker as a I.
Kind of bothered by that I think
that you will see
Some of these businesses some of
the especially the labor unions
that do have apprenticeship
programs in place that are going
I hope set up and pay attention
to what this is actually
creating here Madam speaker
gentle lady.
I.
I do have to applaud.
Our electric cooperatives I have
to applaud the Xcel energy I
have to applaud the gas company
of New Mexico.
The propane industry of New
Mexico.
What they have done for these
low income households.
They're the ones that are taken
in shorts madams Madam speaker
and gentle lady they are going
to go out there they are trying
to help these homeowners make
their homes more energy
efficient.
And they will run a check.
They will helpful for needed
they will replace light bulbs
they will review the list goes
on and on so.
Whenever we are actually taking
money from taxes.
That come into our state
coffers.
And using it.
Into perpetuity there is a
problem there madam speaker
thank you very much.
There's further debate the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
Representative Matthews.
Thank you madam chair of with
the gentle lady would propose
you'll please Madam speaker I
yield to the gentle lady from
Bernalillo.
Of.
Thank you and then Madam chair
of.
Of Representative
There's a lot of discussion
about jobs and I think you also
talked about the reduction in
the percent of income that low
income people would pay for the
homes that were had these
improvements made is that
correct.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
There are a lot there will be a
lot of jobs created with this
bill and folks was low income
folks will see lower energy
bills.
Madam chair and thank you and
will there be any benefits
environmental benefits as a
result of this bill.
Madam speaker gentle lady yes
there will be less energy use.
And madam chair the gentle lady
could you expand on that a
little bit.
Madam speaker gentle lady folks
are we'll be using less energy
because they have energy
efficient products in their home
so that will.
Will draw less energy from the
grid and.
And we believe it will help
fight climate change madam
speaker gentle lady.
Madam chair gentle lady
in addition the group that will
average of the bit about and I
this is not an area I have much
expertise and if any but there's
he pops are now considered to
One of the state of the art of
heating and cooling devices will
if that's accurate I guess that
should be my first question but
and then my second question is
if this actor would these be
available to the people who
qualify for these grants Madam
speaker gentle lady anyone who
knows me knows how much I love
the heat pump
today they are highly efficient
to cool or heat your house and
they are included as you know as
an energy efficient.
Lance.
Madam chair gentle lady they
would be available.
Madam speaker generally yes.
Thank you madam chair the gentle
lady my last question
relates to health benefits are
there any health benefits to the
families who receive these
retrofits or these upgrades in
their physical environment.
Madam speaker and gentle gentle
lady I'm glad you brought that
up you know I think as you make
your home more efficient less
drafts through the windows to
roll the windows more insulation
change switching to some
electric appliances you'll find
less indoor air pollution and
of.
He you'll have a cozy healthy
house.
Madam chair gentle lady would
that mean if you're living in a
because a healthy house that
maybe the people are healthier
to.
Minister gentlelady at yes I
would hope so but I also think
it's important to note that you
know if you're not over burdened
by your utility payments that
you're gonna have good mental
health as well.
Madam chair of gentle lady thank
you
I'm wondering if if you would
agree with me that people who
live in healthier environments
are more capable of working
holding jobs and possibly even
more willing to go out and and
work outside the home with would
you agree with that then speaker
gentle lady as I do agree.
Thank you madam chair I yield.
There's further debate the
gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln Representative Nibert.
Thank you madam speaker with the
gentle lady from south shields
and speaker I yield to the
gentleman.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady.
I do would like to.
After a couple of questions the
store.
Dealing with the language on
page twelve.
And the.
Really focusing in on section
six.
Representative phase three I say
the word targeted.
The underserved community line
sixteen.
Who is the one that targets that
particular community.
Madam speaker and gentleman how
it really is up to the local
government for tribal entity to
work with their local community
to determine who needs the most
help
yeah.
So some madam speaker gentle
lady of it's a governmental and
to do that that would would
determine that that so here is
that they want to
the service is a the actor of.
Nancy for gentleman it's local
your local government tribal
political subdivisions.
If I look at the definition of
underserved community could you
tell me how many counties in New
Mexico with for qualify as an
underserved community.
gentleman I would reckon that
there is and underserved
community and every single
county in the state of New
Mexico Madam speaker and gentle
lady that's on my question how
many counties of the thirty
three qualify as underserved
communities by your definition.
Madam speaker and gentleman I I
want to be clear this is not a
county wide program but it's the
local county that would identify
and underserved community based
on income or energy burden.
Madam speaker gentle lady you
may need to the redefine your
your definition of underserved
community of Senator and to it's
going to ask the same thing
about municipalities but I
suppose the same answer with the
crew there as well would it not
Madam speaker gentle lady.
Madam madam speaker gentleman's
County municipality the
neighborhood which I know is
within a county or a
municipality can benefit from
this program.
Madam speaker gentle lady I.
I hope the people in those
counties benefit from the
program but the.
I'm just trying to get to if we
have any counties that that the
definition for municipalities of
fit that definition that appears
in your bill Madam speaker
gentle lady.
Madam speaker gentleman I I'm
sorry I.
I just I need a little bit of
clarification on your question.
Madam speaker gentle lady I was
just looking for numbers.
The chairman I don't think I can
give you a number I think there
are many underserved
neighborhoods streets blocks in
every single County.
And a county can apply for this
for this funding a municipality
can a tribe can the solemn water
district.
Can also.
Madam speaker gentle lady I
recognize that that's why I
wasn't going to ask you how many
neighborhoods and suburbs
sections of those governmental
entities would apply because
that would be a very difficult
number to determine if but I
don't think it be too hard to
determine which counties fit
that criteria and I don't think
it be hard to figure out which
municipalities for the.
Roger but that's okay we we will
move on to know which
communities in New Mexico have a
high energy burden.
Madam speaker gentleman there
there are a lot of communities
that have high energy burden
they're all around the state
some have higher energy burdens
than other others.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
do you have some examples
factual names of those
communities because I'm trying
to get a feel for where we could
qualifies for some of this stuff
that's defined in this
legislation.
Thank you madam speaker at
gentleman the county that has
the highest energy burden is
McKinley County but.
They have there are lots of low
income people and that County
along with all all every single
county has communities that have
high energy burdens so I want to
be clear Madam speaker gentleman
that.
This has an impact on every
single county every single
municipality.
This can really help a lot of
people in every corner of the
state.
So is it your testimony Madam
speaker and gentle lady that but
basically every community fits
these criteria.
Thank you John yes.
Madam speaker gentle lady I
don't want to put words in your
mouth but eyes I suppose the
same answer may apply to which
communities have limited access
to energy efficiency.
What my supposition be.
Acted in that regard.
Madam speaker gentleman
you would be right.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
looking the program be on page
thirteen.
We see what the.
Some of the
projects are supposed to to
accomplish.
And I see the words.
Protect the public health.
So eight.
To give me an idea of what is
meant by how these.
Energy efficient projects
protect the public health Madam
speaker gentle lady.
Could you kind of give me some
ideas to what.
That language means in this
bill.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman any time you're
reducing energy use your
reducing emissions emissions can
cause public health issues like
asthma.
so as we have energy efficient
energy efficient homes we have
fewer emissions thus the public
health benefits.
Madam speaker gentle lady I'm
glad you clarified that because
I've always.
Been under the impression that
higher.
Energy use by a.
Nation by the state by community
generally translates into.
More advanced public health that
the community is healthier as
that society is that community
is that state or nation.
Utilizes energy resources and I
just point you to an island in
the carribean.
One island two countries Haiti
and the Dominican Republic and
the I think you can see the
difference from space between
those two countries has to their
utilization of of energy.
And it's a fact the program B.
two we see the word economic
recovery.
So could you explain to me how
these energy
The version three projects
should be
Reviewed for terms of.
Contributing to the economic
recovery.
Thank you madam speaker
gentleman's it takes people to
do this kind of work those
people will be hired and will be
paid a wage.
So they'll be making their
income putting that money right
back into their community.
Madam speaker gentle lady would
that be economic recovery in
that county the for that
municipality for that just be
the general economic recovery
within the state.
Madam speaker gentleman's I
think it's both.
Madam speaker gentle lady I hope
not.
I hope that what you meant by
that with that it would promote
economic recovery in the
community in which this grant is
being applied in that we would
be investing in that community
in hopes of that community.
in Jordy's some the economic
recovery and that gets back to
the point I believe that the
gentle lady from Sierra was
making.
If we have.
Requirement.
That.
These projects can only
go forward.
With criteria that demands.
Registered apprenticeship
programs.
And.
The other term the G. use for
for what.
Internships.
The.
My view from being from.
Far southeast New Mexico is a
generally those programs are
only associated with contractors
from the larger metropolitan
area and so are our real concern
is that our community I believe
your community.
May not receive those economic
benefits based upon the wording
of the statute and I think that
you may want to I revisit some
of the.
Again
B. three B. three
We see the word reduce economic
hardships.
And again my question would be.
How do you view that those words
in connection with doing these
projects that would be applied
for you and your community Madam
speaker gentle lady.
Mr chairman of there is no doubt
in my mind that of the this
epidemic has affected every
community
It's it's been so difficult so.
The way I think about this bill
is that and we're providing.
Jobs to folks to make their
communities better and more
efficient so you know there is.
You know there's just a great
opportunity now to to get you to
get those boots on the ground to
get
to make communities.
And houses safer and
And to reduce the energy burden
so you know I think it's I think
it's a helpful thank.
And madam speaker and gentle
lady.
When you use when you made that
statement were you referring to
your community specifically or
again were you referring to the
state generally.
Madam speaker and gentleman our.
Every corner of the state has
been affected by economic with
economic hardship.
So my community your community
every community.
In determining the grant in the
application processing
applications.
To to make these determinations
and.
I think it's important to know.
Which.
How are they going to evaluated
is that where the grant is going
to be
Affecting the people on the
ground for the just the state
generally and I'm.
Madam speaker gentle lady not
to not to lead you an answer but
I'm really hoping that it's the.
For the grants applied that's
where I see the the the real
benefits of of this type of
legislation and not just simply
allowing benefits to accrue to
the Albuquerque metro area and
not to where these projects are
going to be in all parts of the
state and so you know I look at
paragraph two and three
contribute to economic recovery.
Reduce the economic hardship
I'm.
Law I hope that when they view
the application they're going to
look at it more specifically to
the area around where that grant
money is going to be applied and
not to the state generally and
that's that's the crux of my
question Madam speaker and
gentle and.
Mr gentleman individuals
families are going to be able to
reduce their energy burden.
It's it's it's individual
families
a local a local political
subdivisions applies for these
requests the in the rulemaking
process much of this will be
determined by geographic
diversity is part of.
Is part of that.
So madam speaker gentle lady if
if I understand your answer
correctly program three is
solely the reduction in the
energy cost not the job that may
be created not the
goods and services that may be
applied in the local community
your focus solely on the cost
reduction in the Energy.
The gentleman.
There and that's that's all
important reducing the energy
burden the local jobs that will
be created.
This is madam speaker gentleman
in this is this is a really
focused on the the locality.
And the folks who who need that
help.
Then looking down at the very
bottom of page of thirteen over
on to page fourteen I see the
words portfolio of.
Community projects for.
Portfolio the community energy
efficiency projects.
Could you talk a little bit
about what you mean by or what
you intend to buy them the
forwards portfolio of community
energy projects.
Madam speaker gentleman of the
portfolio is all the projects
that are going to apply for this
program.
and you know those projects need
to be.
Geographically diverse and they
need to focus on helping those
families that have high energy
burdens that need the low income
requirements or the federal
housing requirements.
And madam speaker gentle lady at
and which meet the goals of this
and and again war.
I want to.
I want to make sure that.
Are we talking specifically
community community or we
talking about globally benefits
to the state generally.
Madam speaker and gentleman I.
We're we're really talking about
local benefits local benefits to
the neighborhood a colonia to
you know a even in a second so
ciation you know it's the
benefits are to the low income
families who qualify and to the
use those folks who live in
affordable housing that their
budget with from lower utility
bills and also jobs in the local
areas.
Madam speaker gentle lady
When you answered a question
that was posed by the gentleman
from Dona Ana do you stated.
The people were paying so much
money for their utility bills
and that that is what really was
the impetus for this
legislation.
I a few questions in that regard
Madam speaker gentle lady.
If the price of coal.
As decreased in the last twenty
years.
The price of natural gas has.
Balanced around but has not seen
significant increases.
How do the.
Utility bills on presupposing
you mean electric bills
increase in that scenario.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
This really is about.
Replacing those energy and
efficient appliances and old
homes so that folks have a lower
energy burden.
So if you're lose using less
energy because you now have an
energy efficient refrigerator or
the table he
you know that that's where the
benefits are for folks.
Madam speaker gentle lady I
understand that but you said the
impetus for this legislation was
because people were paying so
much money for their utility
bills my question is if the.
Traditional.
The importance.
For generating that.
Energy.
Have stayed steady or gone down.
Why would their utility bills
now the.
Out of sight.
More whatever term you wish to
use.
Mr Chairman.
Low income folks.
Sometimes live often live in.
Pretty terrible houses that
have.
Old windows.
Not very much insulation is a is
this the Saudi housing stock
right so that's what this
program would address is.
Making these homes more energy
efficient.
And this and thus lowering the
bills.
More more more Madam speaker and
gentle lady that that's a lofty
goal envision fair and one that
the you know I I have no
disagreement with.
the problem is.
For now using tax money is the
the to make the energy
efficiency occur and.
Hi this.
Submit to you that energy bills
have encouraged.
Energy bills have increased even
for buildings that have been
built with the.
We'd of recognized energy
efficiency appliances and
windows and doors and and all
the the goes into and yet
they're energy bills have gone
up
and and you know I just find it
A little bit that the on the one
hand energy bills have gone up.
The price of the input of
traditional energy has stayed
steady or gone down.
And there's a reason why we
don't need to debate that now
but there's a reason why.
Because the public policy that
this body is instituted and.
Now on the other hand.
We are engaging in this
activity.
To supplement the energy
efficiency to drive down the
cost of these folks.
For the same time we have
instituted public policy that is
driving up the cost of energy
and and that's the real point
the madam speaker and gentle
lady
will work for doing something on
one hand and now on the other
hand because they're being
impacted.
Negatively and understandably
negatively we're having good now
engage in this activity of
trying to supplement programs or
provide money for supplemental
programs to enhance energy
efficiency to lower their costs
because they're saying they're
being squeezed at the present
time
Madam speaker and gentle lady
thank you.
There's further debate the
gentle lady from Rio Arriba
Santa Fe and Taos Representative
at LA.
Thank you madam speaker what
the committee from yes please
yield thank you madam speaker I
will gladly yield to the gentle
lady from everybody and those
are the kind.
You know I.
When I when I first came about
thirty years ago to
In New Mexico and settled in and
that include okay Rio Arriba
County I worked with an
organization called said that
they'll not the which was a
community dealt development
corporation really one of the
first nation in a rural area.
Did.
Services for all kinds of
services for for people and and
rural communities and at the
time they had they had gotten a
requests
I think was under the Reagan
administration at that time to
do a weather station program.
And I think this this bill
builds upon that sort of thing
and I just want to tell you kind
of how we're doing and and rural
northern New Mexico at the time
was a wonderful program we hired
local contractors and I was
probably at that contractors
right at the time and then we
had hired
you know high school kids young
college kids they were hired as
labour's and there are about two
of those the young young
students who worked with the
master contractor and they went
out to these homes and they they
did weather station they put in
windows a they put a new doors
they checked the house for the
kids they looked at the
basements I looked at the
addicts and and they did all
that all those sorts of things
and it was actually a wonderful
program and of course we ran out
of money was a three year grant
there is still plenty of work to
do would you like to know
Kind lady what were the homes
that needed the most weather is
ation.
Speaker gentle lady I would like
to know that.
I'm glad
I it was mobile homes there's a
high home ownership among people
who have mobile phones a lots of
people on these phones but they
really had have for the most
part certainly the older ones
huge energy loss so they would
go into these mobile homes they
would build skirts around the
bottom they would help them you
know whether eyes that and that
was just a really valuable
service and their electric or
their electricity bills are
there propane or whatever four
two medically reduced under this
program and we kept we kept
careful records and
and it was it was a proven
success and I think what you're
talking about built upon purpose
of this and I don't know if the
I'm sure the body.
Remembers this but this first
weather station program came
about in nineteen seventy six
under Gerald Ford and that was
when the OPEC nations are set
off all the all the petroleum to
all the nations of that we're
backing Israel in the Yom Kippur
War so so admittedly we had no
oil in this in this country and
Gerald Ford put this first
weather is ation program
together.
The next six presidents built
upon a project because it was so
successful so every president
that came in after that would
build upon this program because
it really works throughout the
country in all.
In all communities especially in
rural communities it was so
valuable and and it exists today
and I think is a term kind lady
that what you're really trying
to do is have New Mexico build
upon the success of those
programs and to create funding
locally so that we can take
these programs further.
Madam speaker gentle lady
absolutely yes.
do you think this is a job
creation program.
Speaker gentle lady I do believe
that.
So most of the money really is
gonna probably be spent on job
creation fund because you're
gonna be hiring people to do
this work
and then you have the obviously
the supplies but usually usually
in these programs the the labor
part far out exceeds the cost of
the supplies to build these is
is that true thank you
yes that is often the case.
You know it was for us in our
little town of Dixon and food
and people are and can you just
go it was it was really a way to
bring.
You know young kids who didn't
have a job of they worked as
laborers I mean we take pay them
whatever the minimum wage was at
the time that they learned a lot
and then we got a lot of them
back in school because because
they had a successful job you
know it's it's a big deal when
you're eighteen to go into a
grandmother's home and replace
all the windows and help her and
do this work and of course all
these ladies would fix them a
huge lunch every day they would
show up because that's the way
they are in the north right and
and they just they just had such
a sense of pride and for most of
these kids were unemployed at
the time we hired kids who are
unemployed to bring them into
this program is that how you
envisioning this program
working.
Gentle lady and madam speaker
gentle lady are yes and not only
young people will benefit from
this program there plenty I have
to be really careful to you
referred to the folks who are
maybe not so young who can also
be employed and do this really
good working community and get
to eat empanadas and enchiladas
from these I believe those who
are getting new windows.
you madam chair and
kind lady I totally agree at
this point everybody's almost
younger than me so I tend to put
everybody in one category but
yes I would agree with that and
so for those reasons madam
speaker and the gentle lady I
support this legislation.
There's further debate the
gentle lady from granted
although and Sierra
Representative down.
Thank you kind speaker
gentle lady we yield.
Madam speaker I yield to the
gentle lady from all those
counties thank you madam speaker
and thank you gentle lady and I
just you know I just want to in
this body we're not supposed to
make opinions about people's
presentations I just wanna make
sure that it's very clear that
have no hostility towards this
bill in my own local community
I've been
Posted many community meetings
about the USDA programs that are
available for disabled families
and for veterans Madam speaker
and gentle lady are you familiar
with those programs.
Madam speaker gentle lady yes
thank you thank you madam
speaker and gentle lady because
in my community they get
identify the number of
households a believer eligible
and for those of you I I hope
everybody knows about the
program because the USDA a
program is for disabled folks
and veterans and they and senior
citizens in fact and they can
apply for funding it's a seven
thousand dollar grant fifteen
thousand dollar loan and in some
cases depending on the program
up to sixty thousand dollars in
home repairs to make their home
safe accessible and and
efficient
Madam speaker and gentle lady so
I'm familiar with these programs
and I promote them I believe in
them and so I just want you to
know I don't have any hostility
towards helping low income
people have reducing their
utility fees we promotes ****
programs and the soil and water
conservation districts often
have a programs where they give
requests for.
Cost share for anything that
reduces water use energy
efficiency thank you to
refrigerators and dishwashers
and and I make sure that the
folks in my district know about
those programs and access them
as much as they can.
but what.
But I do have a concern about is
that when we pass a bill.
It has to be plainly written.
And I think it's important that
it's written in a way that's
clear enough that those that are
tasked with the rules.
I understand your intents and
can follow it with ease.
Madam speaker internally I'm I'm
trying to understand your
intents and as the debate goes
on I've gotten less and less
it's gotten less let's clear for
me
but.
I guess what I I need to get
back to the apprenticeship
application Act because you've
referred to a couple times but
are you familiar with the
apprenticeship application out.
Madam speaker gentle lady I I'm
not as familiar as I'd like to
be but I do know what it does
I'm sure you can tell me thank
you madam speaker and gentle
lady that.
Does that provide the definition
of a paid apprenticeship program
enacted that were the definition
is because I'm not familiar.
With that I don't have
any there's no contractors in my
district.
That are approved for internship
programs to the act defined in
this bill so I'm wondering if if
I wanted to know how to to in
front of this in my local
district what I find the
definition of the pandemic
apprenticeship in that act.
Madam speaker gentle lady it is
quite possible you will but you
don't have to have a paid
apprenticeship program to
participate in this program you
can pay and provide local paid
internships I wanna be clear
here that
that you and that nonunion
companies both have adjusted
programs.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady but isn't it true
that only.
This bill is limiting it to.
On page three.
Nine seven section eight when
you said registered
apprenticeship program that
promotes diversity means and
pension program registered
pursuant to the apprenticeship
assistance act that is a
particular type of
apprenticeship program that is
limited to.
And does exclude others isn't
that correct.
Madam speaker gentle lady you
don't have to use a registered
apprentice program you can also
use a pay local internship.
I'm gonna be clear here.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
but on page.
Three.
Where you define I registered
apprenticeship program it's then
again referenced.
On page eight.
That they have to be a provider
committee partner to employ
apprentices from a registered
apprenticeship program.
And it's again.
Madam speaker gentle lady on
page twelve registered printer
program.
Speaker gentle lady.
Registered apprenticeship
program is defined and we use
that definition in in the rest
of the bill that you don't have
to use just that you can use the
of HB could be hiring folks from
a registered apprenticeship
program for local paid
internship thank you thank you
madam speaker thank you
generated up so let's let's
focus let's just focus on page
twelve.
In section six line a.
Section eight line five and six
it says shall the word shall.
Is mandatory doesn't they may is
there a reason it do you object
to replace the word shall with
the word may.
Madam speaker gentle lady yes I
do object thank you madam
speaker and thank you gentle
lady and then when we get to
line fifteen it says.
It must.
It includes a commitment by a
service provider can you partner
to employ apprentices from a
registered apprenticeship
program that promotes diversity
or to find paid internships to
persons from target underserved
communities so madam speaker
gentle lady must do one of the
two.
Madam speaker gentle lady the
first word in.
graph for is whether.
So.
You just have to say madam
speaker gentle lady if you're
using a.
Apprenticeship program or a paid
internship thank you madam
speaker and gentle lady in one
of the local contractors in my
community.
ABC construction buckets
plumbing.
Of our construction what if they
use neither.
Madam speaker gentle lady then
they just say that in the
application.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
however you're creating a point
system you're creating a
priority.
Thank you for lines of the is
that your question.
Madam speaker gentle lady do you
intend to create a point system
that prioritizes people using a
partition for paid internships.
Madam speaker gentle leading
gentle lady there will be a
rulemaking we would like these
things to be considered in that
rulemaking.
This bill doesn't say anything
about a point system these are
criteria.
Madam speaker general lady is
that your.
Is it your intention that those
be consider what is being
considered as a be considered so
that it's a priority or that
it's not a priority.
Madam speaker gentle lady people
have to get paid for their work
period so what we're suggesting
is that day they can be
apprenticeships what I can get
internships.
Thank you madam speaker Julie
thank you so that is what you're
saying Madam speaker gentle lady
on page one the act relating to
utilities and acting the
community energy efficiency
development Bob Graham creating
a grant program to implement
energy efficiency measures and
low income households
authorizing the New Mexico
mortgage finance authority apply
for Canadian energy efficiency
water development block grant
mandating I think you struck the
rest of that is it struck the
rest of that struck with the
amendment.
Madam speaker gentle lady yes
the line is a sixteen through
online twenty.
Low income customers that struck
thank you thank you madam
speaker thank you gentle lady so
I don't see anywhere in the act
that this bill or legislation is
about apprenticeships.
Or about paid internships.
Gentlelady this this bill is
about reducing energy burdens
for low income folks to get
there you got to hire people to
do the work.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady I believe that's
pretty obvious the question is
whether the title of the of the
bill.
Is correct when you look at the
language that is being
prescribed in the application
process.
Madam speaker gentle lady.
Can you tell me why this bill to
not go to appropriations.
Madam speaker gentle lady there
is no money in this bill thank
you madam speaker gentle lady
but yet you reference that it's
in the general fund I the only
thing that I found in the
general fund relating to this
something that sounds like the
program is on page one eighty
nine.
The line seventeen to implement
a community efficient energy
efficiency program and
underserved communities fifteen
million dollars is that what
you're referencing ma'am.
Mexico's only the yes thank you
madam speaker and gentle lady
and was the energy and mineral
energy minerals and natural
resources the ones who put this
here.
Speaker gentle lady that was in
the LFC budget.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady was of the
recommendation the
recommendations in the LFC
budget not in the governor's and
not in the agencies.
Mexico gentle lady it was in the
LFC budget only Madam speaker
internally was a only on the LFC
budget.
Madam speaker gentle lady there
was no appropriation requests
from energy minerals.
But ended up in the LFC budget.
Thank you madam speaker yes
everything's in the LFC budget
thank you and somewhere I just
wonder where it originated from
and madam speaker and gentle
lady on page one seventy nine.
This is a special appropriation
section section five is a
special appropriations and it
talks about and these dollar
shall revert to the appropriate
fund do you envision the unspent
dollars reverting to the general
fund for to the frontier that
you're creating.
Madam speaker gentle lady this
bill is creating a fund a non
reverting fund.
Madam speaker gentle lady one of
the senior member of our
legislative finance committee
just came and told me that this
was never recommendation in the
legislative finance committee
budget any he was unaware until
today that it appeared in the
legislative finance committee
budget.
So so it
it it it did ultimately it yet
you're accurate it all
ultimately end up in the house
bill amended budget but
originated in the energy
minerals and natural resources
says wondering if that was
something that they brought this
bill to you.
Madam speaker gentle lady I'm
I'm sorry there two gentleman
that are making it hard for me
to look at you directly.
Sorry gentleman.
Madam speaker I can eat
certainly could you please
repeat your question Madam
speaker and gentle lady there's
typically when there's this big
of an appropriation.
It would have gone to the
preparation committee I think
you need that does have no
appropriation it and go to
appropriations committee but
somehow its in house bill two
size a curious where it
originated from within the
governor's recommendation energy
mineral natural resources a
resident LFC the answers energy
mineral natural resources my
next question is to the unspent
dollars where will they revert
if your bill passes and not all
the fifteen million dollars is
spent where will it revert.
Madam speaker gentle lady it's a
non reverting fund.
So we'll just continue to use
that funding.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
the appropriation comes from the
general fund.
And I'm just wondering if
there's a language in here that
this this this fifteen million
dollars will be.
In the title of the act.
Trying to set up I'm sorry it's
extremely confusing because I
asked you like in the beginning
I never seen this bill before
community energy efficiency
development block grant.
That is going to be developed by
energy mineral natural resources
no no no there fifteen million
dollars going to go to energy
mineral natural resources.
Madam speaker gentle lady this
bill creates the funds that is
how's that energy minerals nap
and then natural resources money
from the the general fund can go
into that funds of money from
the federal government through
requests for philanthropic
sources foundations whatever
what have you can fund that
fund.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady will the fifteen
dollars that you referenced on
page one fifteen million dollars
on page twenty nine be put into
the fund.
As a Christian lady yes.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady so we're we're
sending fifteen million dollars
to energy minerals and natural
resources and then energy and
mineral natural resources is
going to.
Create a grant program and then
they're going to ask Mexico
mortgage finance ability to
apply for that grant program to
transfer all fifteen million
dollars to energy to New Mexico
mortgage finance authority and
then they're going to distribute
the funds.
Mr personality now.
Speaker Julie can you please
explain to me how this is going
to get the money.
It's under energy mineral energy
minerals and natural resources
department on page twenty nine.
So.
Madam speaker gentle lady I'm
I'm really glad you asked that
question I want to clarify this
is a fund that is a non
reverting fund in the state
treasury EMNRD holds that fund
EMNRD will make grants to local
governments tribal governments
the NSA can apply for these
funds to use to complement their
weather is ation projects which
are units which are funded by
federal dollars this is not a
whole house whether is Asian
project this is that they're
very very targeted energy
efficiency programs.
Madam speaker and gentle lady I
have an amendment introduced
please.
Generally to introduce the
amendment.
To move the
I think it's pass to hold a
minute has been passed out.
The lady to your amendment thank
you madam speaker I move that
how I move house floor amendment
one to house bill thirty seven.
Gentlelady to explain even thank
you madam speaker gentle lady on
page three strike line seven
three thirteen three letter
accordingly on page eight fine I
add the word and after the
semicolon on page eight strike
lines six through ten and
remember accordingly on page
twelve strike line fifteen
through nineteen clean number
accordingly.
Basically what I'm doing is
striking the references to
registered apprenticeship
programs that are.
Pursuant to the apprenticeship
assistance act.
To ensure that the gentle lady's
intent is fulfilled.
Bill call vote.
You will have a roll call
mission to ensure that the
gentle lady's intent is filled
the gentle lady has clearly
stated and restated throughout
the process of this debate that
she does not intend to limit
these applications to or to give
preferential treatment to
apprenticeships internships but
that's you want these dollars go
local comedian she wants people
to be paid.
And so having experience before
the barrier that's done when
this language is present knowing
that there's less than a dozen
of these contractors throughout
the state that meet this
criteria.
It becomes burdensome it won't
get to our communities and so my
intent is to make sure that
these dollars get to every nook
and cranny because we all have
contractors that are licensed we
all have contractors that meet
the requirements of the
construction industry licensing
act we all have contractors that
are bonded and are capable of
doing this work in the local
community for these contractors
are already doing the work in
our USDA programs that assist
with the winter rising and
energy efficiency for our
seniors are disabled veterans
and for folks with disabilities
these contractors are already
able to demonstrate every other
part of what the criteria lines
out these folks are doing the
work on our multi family housing
or low income housing in each of
our communities and I certainly
do not want them excluded and
without all stand for questions.
Gentle lady is this a friendly
amendment.
Madam speaker is not.
There is debate can the
gentleman from San Juan
Representative Montoya.
Thank you madam speaker
gentlelady from grant Hidalgo
and Sierra counties do you.
Madam speaker I yes I yield to
the gentleman from San Juan.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady
once again.
Hi am new to the construction
industry.
I've only been doing it since
all its may be able to and a
half months
but as I have become aware of
the costs associated with
construction.
are you aware that the cost of a
single employee is not their
wage alone.
The cost of their wage and then
the burden of caring.
The employee so madam speaker
and gentle lady the cost of the
of caring about employee is
pairing paying a portion of
their taxes and then whatever
insurance per employee that
you're having to pay for you are
also having to train the cost of
training so madam speaker and
gentle lady there's already a
cost for you bring employee on
to train them.
And that is borne by the by the
construction company and
virtually every other business
that exists and that cost
generally is twice approximately
twice the cost of the wage so
madam speaker and gentle lady.
The cost.
Before you can start to recover
on that employee.
You have to recover that burden
the cost of of the employees
wage and then the other caring
costs for having that employee
semester and gentle lady before
you can even start to them put.
Some sort of margin twenty
percent twenty five percent
thirty percent whatever the
market bears.
That is what you pay for the
extra forty so madam speaker and
gentle lady.
We're talking here about.
Using this for a low income
housing affordable housing so
madam speaker and gentle lady.
I believe that we here in Santa
Fe.
Are the.
Are the folks who more
understand.
Trying to keep the cost to to to
perform.
Reasonable especially if you're
gonna find if you're trying to
do this for for low income
housing because medic
originality it's very much like
Medicare for Medicaid and
Medicare payments for doctors if
you're working in a and low
income what you're trying to do
is get multiple homes done at
one time efficiently.
Because you're gonna have to
take less money because it
doesn't exist.
Again in affordable housing so
madam speaker and gentle lady do
we think that we here in Santa
Fe especially the majority of
people here who have never been
in construction do we think that
this is the best group to
determine what should happen at
how a business should be hiring
and who they should be hiring or
should be more.
Specific especially for trying
to find a good product.
At a lesser price for affordable
housing and for communities that
are desperately in need of
worker housing thank you Mr
speaker and thank you John and
that's a really long complicated
question that has multiple
answers we are the lawmakers so
we are supposed to create the
frameworks for these things but
I I learned in my three terms
here that when our framework is
too vague it's left up to the
folks left left to do the
rulemaking to define and
interpret and that's why I
appreciate it and I'm able to
vote for bills when they defined
criteria and this is too vague
and it's left up to someone else
to fill in the blanks it's also.
Something for me in a rural
community.
The population density of my
district is two people per
square mile.
The scale of operations to meet
the standards that we put in
place are not easily replicated
in rural areas a small of the
population the heart it is
harder it is to comply with more
and more expectations and so not
just that I'm so glad to see
that all this reporting was
struck but now the burden is
falling on this applicant has
the contractor not the residents
these are most likely going to
be for profit contractors doing
work on rental properties
because most low income folks
don't own their home so they're
gonna be doing they're gonna be
doing remodels on properties are
probably owned by someone who
has that is charging rent and so
I think it's extremely important
so we're going to budget a for
profit contractor and she's
saying this is for economic
development I'm not going to
disagree that's what she says
it's for to a contractor I want
to contractors in my district to
get it already know I don't have
one of the suspects area and if
there isn't one in a community
with like to the consequences or
Silvercity those are the biggest
cities in my community there's
probably not in any of the rural
communities that are represented
in this room so that's that's my
intent I'm I'm only being
responsive and first clarified
that that was also hers and so
as far as setting the cost of
doing business definitely set
the cost you know I know that I
saw a report just a couple weeks
ago we created some standards
and and and increase wages for
child care workers and we double
the cost of childcare New Mexico
so we created a greater cliff
and we are now defined as a
state with a child care desert
and so sometimes we set the
standards we have an ended to
the consequences when I look at
a bill I think first do no harm.
And I don't want to contractors
in my community to lose out on
this opportunity.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady
several years ago there was
legislation that was passed that
said that the a disabled a
business owned by a disabled
person would have would have to
be considered just like this
would have to be considered
whenever a state agency goes out
for an RFP and so and those out
so goes out to bid so madam
speaker and gentle lady let me
tell you what that meant in my
community
we have local printers that
would go and try and bid for
jobs with the San Juan college
but what happened was the
waiting system they could have
chosen the local company but
what they did was well this
group out of Albuquerque would
apply for all of these printing
jobs and they were owned by
someone who.
Was a who was a of the fifty
fifty the specific request
within.
With the point system so what
happened was after a while none
of our local print shops even
started going to the college for
any jobs that came up because
what was happening was because
it was one of the items of the
it criteria for on the
application.
And someone from Albuquerque was
able to do that they were given
either getting it so so not only
does the.
College.
Not.
Help keep employed local
employees.
Our local community lose out on
the gross receipts tax.
So madam speaker and gentle lady
this has become I I I think we
may have fixed that problem
there with the destination
sourcing.
Prior to that there were years
and years and years however
still doesn't help that business
those local print shops are not
able to get that work and so
madam speaker angelic I think
your viewpoint of the unintended
consequences.
And I think the these unintended
consequences are.
Construction companies in all of
these local communities are
going to be passed over.
Once twice and then never
applied again.
What would be the point of
applying if you are are if it's
just a waste of your time is go
after other work.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you generally that that is that
is exactly a perfect example of
what I think it unintended
consequence of the and we're
creating an act.
We're creating an act that
requires deliberation and I know
that there are half the members
of this body that represent
communities like I do.
And we get to go back and say we
brought fifteen million dollars
of economic development that we
have a we have would be cool and
equitable access to.
We get to go back and say we we
didn't vote for this amendment.
And I don't know why we
wouldn't.
Thank you madam speaker Mr
speaker and gentle lady I I do
believe that it's incumbent upon
us to.
Take care for voting I need to
represent my constituents I
don't need representative unions
I do not have to Representative.
Of businesses in Albuquerque
because I'm not from Albuquerque
I don't have to do that we're
looking at something that should
be for local economic
development and should benefit
of the local job market should
benefit the Tax base locally so
and speaker gentle lady I I just
think.
The Albuquerque has enough.
Legislators in this building
that Representative Albuquerque
New I don't think that we need
to be supporting legislation
that is going to shift jobs to
the companies that are so big
already we see this happening
over and over the order to the
pandemic that the large
companies were preferred.
And the mom and pop companies
were the ones that have gone out
of business through decisions
that have been made I have and
the people who who were just
local people trying to survive
they're the ones that pay the
price and we continue to do that
because special interest over
and over outweighs local
business office of.
By the way Mr speaker and gentle
lady does your amendment.
Change the overall intent of
this bill and what the sponsor
says the bill is meant to do Mr
speaker and gentleman.
Absolutely not the title.
Of the bill is about creating
committee energy efficiency
period.
And to target low income
families in doing so.
My amendment strikes words that
have nothing to do with the
title of the act and it's even
more important that we do this
considering that this act is
permanent but this.
This is one time money I don't
exactly know what's going on
with the budget it makes no
sense to me Act I don't get it
it's starting and energy
minerals and natural resources
and and the act.
Says.
That they will take implement
energy efficiency measures and
low income households but it's
very very there's a whole lot of
detail in here it sounds like
this is the only program that
could happen but it sounded like
to sponsor saying it could
change over time what what what
what we would do so it's very
very important that we have
flexibility in this and no it
changes nothing whatsoever in
the title which is creating a
grant program to implement
energy efficiency measures in
low income households.
Thank you for that Mr speaker
and gentle lady is there any
recourse I don't see anything in
this bill that gives any
recourse for local businesses
that we're trying to apply for
this and then the work would be
then maybe shifted to I want a
large you companies out of
Albuquerque's any recourse for
those people thank you Mr
speaker and gentleman I never
saw the word local I only saw
the word community but the word
committees not defined and what
organizations not defined and so
I couldn't say thank you for
that Mr speaker and gentle lady
just like the decisions have
been made during the COVID and
the local businesses that have
gone out of business there was
no recourse for them.
And I believe there's no
recourse for local companies
here in this bill is if they are
overlooked four of someone that
can check the apprenticeship box
or the internship barks at a
local company cannot so I I
cannot support this bill as it's
written I hope the body except
your amendment thank you Mr
speaker.
Is there further debate on the
amendment the gentle lady.
From Sapporo Representative Gail
Armstrong.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
kind lady yield thank you Mr
speaker I yield to the kind
lady.
Thank you of Mr speaker and kind
lady.
You know we all want to do we
all try really hard in this
house to do great things for the
state of New Mexico.
And I believe kind lady Mr
speaker that your amendment
helps us do that.
Mr speaker kind lady I believe
that the wording in this bill is
an appropriate I believe that
this bill.
I would hope help my community
and every community across the
state Mr speaker kind lady.
and I think that the majority of
us in this room want that to
happen Mr speaker kind lady when
we.
This is happened to me recently
when we create a bill that does
such good things Mr speaker kind
lady and then we add language.
That makes that hinder
communities.
Mr speaker kind lady I also
would hold.
That house in my community Mr
speaker kindly timberline
construction how to meals as
well and Romero's.
Would be able to apply.
And help the communities.
In my small area of Katrin the
coral.
And part of the Lancia.
And so Mister speaker kindly I
appreciate your amendment I
think there's language in this
bill right now that hinders.
New Mexicans from receiving this
and handers local New Mexicans
from being able to do this
construction work and apply for
this and help our communities.
Ross the state so with that Mr
speaker thank you kind lady.
Thank you Sir further debate on
the amendment chairman San Juan
Representative Strickler thank
you Mr speaker and and with the
gentle lady yield thank you Mr
speaker I yield to the gentleman
from San Juan the gentle lady
you know I do a lot of home
remodeling and we do a lot of
energy efficiency projects and
one of them is is insulation and
we don't have anybody
you are you know you are pretty
sure that does simple insulation
blown insulation lot homeowners
to themselves we have a local
company Valencia insulation that
does all my work and they're
very inexpensive
and it's just a great bang for
the Buck so if this if this man
is on a drive then they they
will be considered it is that is
that your understanding for
speaker gentle lady Mr speaker
and gentle lady there's other
language in here that's going to
make it hard for our folks that
are not used to doing state and
federal applications to prop up
fly this is the most egregious
when this is the barrier that is
blaring it's this and it will
prohibit.
There are other things that make
it difficult the application
process just as they have to
demonstrate they've done these
things in the past so it's still
limiting and and I think that's
unfortunate because anybody
who's licensed with the
constructions divisions gone
through this process is also
bonded in order to apply and so
you know I wish or even broader
than that but this is very very
problematic language if we want
these dollars to go to our local
communities to our local
contractors that are recovering
from COVID as well.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
generally also we we
In my business in remodeling
these homes we replace all the
windows a single pane windows
very efficient you know
insulations our number one
priority and then replace the
windows and and they're just
local contractors that they have
this skill set and we buy the
material
at the local the lumber yard or
home depot or Lowes and then we
we hire local carpenter to
you know remove the windows
installer then once without this
without this language they would
be they would be eligible is is
that your understanding.
Mr speaker and gentleman with
the language they are not
eligible as they have an
apprenticeship program or I mean
they're going to be prioritized
that they're not gonna be
prioritized.
So why the money was said to the
the it would be hard for them to
to do that kind of work and it
is pretty good work you know
it's a labor intensive and of
the and and then the results are
are really good for the fifteen
see the home thank you Mr
speaker thank you gentle lady I
think this amendment is is a
good clarification it opens up
the the opportunities in my
community and I guess Farmington
is a pretty good size community
around forty five thousand
counties around hundred twenty
three thousand and we have a lot
a lot of folks want to go to
work and and I love this type of
work so thank you.

years two July first twenty
twenty seven.
This exemption is is is specific

Next we will go on to item.
Three.
Generated Osama C. ready on that
item yes I am Mr speaker will
you get me to that point let the
record reflect that all action
necessary for placing House Bill
forty seven as amended with an
emergency clause and final
passage is been taken gentlelady
to explain it all.
Mr speaker this bill addresses
an issue that arose as a result
of destination sourcing for
services and I want to be clear
about that destination sources
for services Mr speaker.
Couple of years ago this body
adopted a new way of assessing
taxes.
That focused on where the goods
were delivered.
And where the services were
delivered.
That was because we're very
interested in.
Taxing internet sales into the
tax internet sales we need to
change the structure of how we
tax goods.
New Mexico has a little bit of a
unique system and that we have a
gross receipts tax that taxes
not only the sale of goods but
the sale of services.
When we drafted the bill.
With respect to services.
We excluded something called
professional services and those
of the types of services one
would normally expect doctors
lawyers and so on so forth.
This bill proposes.
To exam home care providers.
From destination sourcing.
And the reason is.
Those businesses have employees.
That serve often serve.
Families and individuals and
care Clooney who are in multiple
counties and this could could
occur within one day so for
example.
There may be a home care service
provider in Espanola which is in
Rio Arriba county in Santa Fe
County they're actually split
between two counties.
That provider may provide
services in Espanola in Rio
Arriba.
Espanola and Santa Fe County and
what state Los Alamos so that
one individual person maybe in
free counties in one day and
it's very difficult to track the
different G. R. T. associated
with multiple counties and so
the home care providers have
asked for this is this
accommodation it's a very narrow
exemption to destination
sourcing for services.
With that Mr speaker I stand for
questions there is debate the
gentleman from the
Representative Scott.
Chairman.
I will representative from
Travis county now.
We County Eddie okay we
introduce.
Miss generated.
This.
This legislation was very
narrowly tailored for the home
health care.
Industry or hello.
Of industry and counties I have
experienced similar.
Significant negative
consequences.
As a result.
Yes in addition for free.
I am aware.
That destination sourcing has
affected to some degree how G.
R. T. is allocated between.
The city's.
In the state.
And frankly I think it's
probably true for a wide range
of services not just those and
what I think you're thinking of
someone fully and Eddy County.
That is exactly correct all of
the services.
Performed.
Or performance.
Israel says.
Of seven women's.
Circumstance.
The provision of
legislation.
Just come across.
Our mission.
Similar consideration to this
piece of legislation.
Thank you Jim lady there's
further debate the gentleman San
Juan Representative Montoya.
Thank you Mr speaker does the
gentle lady you madam chairman
woman Mr speaker and gentleman
yes I gladly yield.
Thank you the speaker and and
the gentle lady
I'm gonna follow up I think a
little bit on what
Representative Scott was talking
about just now
If you could just briefly
explain.
What.
Happens in the instance that
you're talking about.
And the the home health care
provider.
It is
of the businesses in the city
limits but then goes into the
county and does the work what
happens to what would be that
cities portion of G. R. T. tax
what happens that portion that
does not get claim by the city.
Just to clarify for the body Mr
speaker and gentleman the way
our tax system works he is
counties have a G. R. T..
Cities get a portion of the
state's D. R. T. and.
One point two two five
if the home care provider Kerr
under current the current law.
Is located in the city but they
provide services in the county
and if they are able as a
contracted because there's some
difficulty for the small
businesses they only pay the
counties G. R. T..
And the state G. R. T. that's in
the county.
And they do not receive the one
point two two five because under
destination sourcing it is in
that the service would be taxed
at the county right.
Thank you Mr speaker the lady
that's that's exactly what I was
hoping to have discussed here
because the majority of folks
have not that are in the chamber
or.
Our listing on TV
have not had the chance to have
these discussions every year Mr
speaker and gentle lady we have
at the beginning of our
committee meeting we continue to
Have a training even for those
of us who are in tax because
it's not something we deal with
in normal life and we have to
have a refresher the majority of
folks that are in here have
never had a chance to even
did that a little bit of
understanding of G. R. T.
and how G. R. T. is implemented
Mr speaker and gentle lady
This issue with services.
It only applies here because of
gross receipts which is not a
regular sales tax that takes
place in other states and most
other states there are few other
states are starting to the G. R.
T. as well so I can tax services
but.
Prior to the internet than us
trying to fix the internet
problems.
we did not have destination
sourcing within the state and so
dollars prior to us trying to
fix the internet taxing
situation.
The internet taxing situation of
we were trying to remedy a
problem that and that was we
were the that businesses in our
communities we're losing out to
companies who were in other
states and our communities were
missing at losing out on that
tax and so we try to fix that Mr
speaker and gentle lady that I
believe your bill is trying to
remedy at one of those
unintended consequences which is
that correct speaker gentle
lady.
I'm on Mr speaker and gentleman
I'm trying to.
Address a very narrow issue that
relates to health care provider
what I consider to be health
care providers.
Many of whom
are servicing.
Caissons are individuals on
Medicaid or Medicare in the
margins
terms of profit are quite low in
the additional burden and
administrative burden is
impactful.
it may Mr speaker and gentleman.
Eight
So unintentional unintentional I
hope lack of compliance with the
law because it's very hard for
these individual care providers
to track I would also note Mr
speaker and gentleman that
sometimes these family members
moved to different family
households because our families
are sharing the care of these
individuals so the care provider
ninety one months and Rio Arriba
county and another month in
Santa Fe County Alamos County Mr
speaker John.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady do you believe that that
only exists with health care
providers who do not believe
that that compliance issue.
it might have other small
businesses let's let's listen
let's exclude oil and gas at
this point of the conversation
let's just talk about other
small businesses that provide
service.
do you believe that a
potentially as well could have
the same unintended
consequences.
I think there will be very few
situations Mr speaker and
gentleman that replicate the
challenges that home care
providers have in terms of the
rendering of services and we are
in a place Mr speaker and
gentleman where.
People are desperate to increase
access to these sorts of care
providers and the law as it
stands I think has a negative
impact on their ability I can't
say that this would be true for
other businesses Mr speaker and
gentleman in general in general.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady I I think once again I
understand the purpose of your
bill is very narrow.
I just think
Our consideration of other
businesses who will be in the
same situation
our focus should be so narrow as
to.
Not realize that their other
service industries that this is
a problem for some speaker
generated just yet maybe a
different question.
For years.
Companies that provided service
that were that they're
headquartered in within the city
limits all across the state.
and those cities were receiving
that portion of the G. R. T..
when we passed the internet
sales tax fix.
Was it the goal.
Of that.
legislation to because the
city's to lose substantial G. R.
T. I don't believe that was the
goal and I voted for that that
was not my purpose do you
believe that that was the goal.
Of the legislature both chambers
and then when the governor
signed into law do you believe
that that was the purpose of
that fix.
Mr speaker and gentleman
goal I think is
A term I wouldn't use in
probably any context of the tax
code
I think Mr speaker and gentleman
from San Juan.
Those of us who voted for that
bill and I think I was in the
legislature when that happened
my first year.
Recognize and were advised by
tax professionals when we were
considering and that there would
be some rearrangement of how G.
R. T. would be assigned to
cities counties and states and
so on it is my understanding Mr
speaker and gentleman is that
there has been a net increase.
In the cities.
Probably counties as well in
terms of G. R. T. collection as
a result of our changing
the our ability to tax internet
sales and so there's no net
increase I think Mr speaker and
gentleman as a result of that
very important piece of
legislation that this
legislature passed I guess about
three years ago so Mister
speaker and gentle lady I I
think definitely there has been
from the increase to internet
sales.
I believe that did Mr speaker
generated did have that effect
on G. R. T. from because of the
massive internet sales Mr
speaker and gentle lady I I just
think and once again I remember
the debate I remember the
discussion.
The discussion was never about
taking
of from services
we we was never discussed that
this was gonna have that massive
effect from.
Service based businesses and G.
R. T. to those local communities
I think it was unintentional for
the most part of their maybe
there was some other folks who
saw the intention of it but the
vast majority legislation did
not see it that way.
And I think now the problem is.
That dollars are here in Santa
Fe.
And like everything else here in
Santa Fe we think that we are
better suited to spend the money
that's generated these local
communities and I think that's
just a philosophical difference
that we have and I believe
that's a just a it shows it
shows when we are
deliberating here what we do is
we continue to.
C. dollars flowing into the
state and at no point are we
ever willing to say those
dollars are better suited at the
local level and I I look at this
and I'm frustrated by we were
willing to fix one one little
portion of it but I think it's I
think there's a greater
willingness to to say we made a
mistake there this is what we
should do because it would mean
a net loss of income to the
state and I think that needs to
be addressed the we're hearing
about it from local communities
and those are the very same
communities that sent us all
here to serve and I do
understand that there is a
problem and I'm not sure if
you're aware that the Senate has
with this bill as as written and
I think they're wanting to.
make some sort of a change I I
don't know if you want to make
that change on this site or wait
for to take place on the other
side but I I I I I'm not sure if
you're even aware of it but I I
made aware of it myself and I
just want to express I believe
the the problem with this bill
is that it narrowly looks at one
particular group of people that
we all believe I need to be
taken care of but it really
neglects the real problem with
what happened when we pass the
internet sales tax one of the
unintended consequences of seven
more money stealing.
Money that goes to those local
communities and and then once we
get our grubby hands on it here
in Santa Fe we just unwilling to
ever let those dollars go back
we we have said Mister speaker
July we have a big windfall
right now of dollars and so we
can't even see fit to to send
back money back in rebate to the
taxpayers I just think that's a
symptomatic Mr speaker and
gentle lady I I and I I really
would hope that going forward we
actually address the real
problem with a destination
sourcing
and fix this going forward thank
you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen it'll be too hard on
yourself I don't think you can.
next to the gentleman from
Chavis and Lincoln
representative Nibert.
Thank you Mr speaker of the
gentle lady from Los Alamos
field Mr speaker I will yield to
the gentleman from Travis
county.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady.
More questions basically along
the same lines and and I just
want to point out a couple
things and that is.
In white communities of Rossell
a lot of these services may be
provided in the dexter area just
south of Rossell and so if I
understand this legislation that
will allow those home health
care services and hospice
services to charge the City of
Rossell
right and not the dexter right
is that the actor of Mr speaker
dollars.
Mr speaker and gentleman would
you repeat that I I apologize.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
In my community of Rossell were
most of the service providers
have their offices they're
providing services to elderly
folks in the dexter either in
the city of or the ability to
dexter or maybe in the
surrounding County area and just
so I'm clear.
In that instance the city of
Rossell tax rate would be
applicables to the services that
are being provided not the
dexter or the Travis county
right.
Under the on the red Mr speaker
and gentleman under the
legislation that I'm proposing.
Yes and let me say I think what
we mean and I'm happy to have
someone correctly Mr speaker and
gentleman.
What we mean is the city will
get its one point two two five
share of the state G. R. T..
Mr speaker gentle lady that.
I live in the county services
get provided to me when I drill
of water well or whatever and
it's kind of funny because hi
end up paying a city tax rate
about the county right because
they code it that way.
South may be improper but they'd
coated where they're comfortable
coding and then generally it's
where they're located whether
that's complies with the law or
not that's what happens and so
you know I I I see your bill and
and they're gonna coded to the
city of Rossell my example and I
think they have been doing it
but the but the real impact is
basically it's the place where
these companies are located are
going to benefit from the tax
even though the services are
provided and some of our
communities that have maybe a
lesser Tax base or a lesser
ability to secure that gross
receipts tax in my case dexter
probably Mr chair and our Mr
speaker and gentle lady in your
case probably Santa Fe by
inspectors a number of people
from Santa Fe that provide these
types of services in Los Alamos
county so you know it it's just
a policy decision but I agree
with my colleague from San Juan
the that we probably need a more
robust discussion on taxing
policy and these types of issues
because well this is related to
health care
and specifically hospice and and
home health.
This is not a unique
Issue that confronts us.
And I would say that even.
Look at it in a better
perspective.
Even the legal profession
particularly those of us near
near the border of New Mexico
foreign competition with out of
state providers of pay no tax on
services rendered in New Mexico
that's something that.
I would like to work with you on
and maybe do something in the
next couple years to to see
where we need to go in that
regard
I I understand the the issue and
I see what we're trying to do
but it's not you need to this
one area and I would certainly
encourage us to maybe carve out
some time to have a more robust
discussion as
My next door neighbor here from
Santa Fe County.
Can constantly reminds us so we
do need to tackle of.
The entire taxing code in New
Mexico thank you Mr speaker
thank you gentle lady for
answering my questions thank
thank you Janice for the debate
the gentle lady from Catherine
Sikora influencia Representative
Armstrong.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady yield.
Mr speaker and gentle lady of
course I'd love to yield to you
thank you Mr speaker and kind
lady I too am a co sponsor on
this bill because it was brought
to my attention several months
ago Mr speaker kind lady and I
actually sent an official letter
of in April.
And wanting to bring this to
light to make sure that people
knew about it Mr speaker kind
lady and so I appreciate that
this actually happened
hi two Mr speaker kind lady
would
take heed to all the other
representatives that spoke
especially Representative Scott
to say that we need to look at
all of these bills that are
coming forward fairly
and Mr speaker kindly I don't
really have a question but I
would like to also note that we
still need all of the services
home healthcare and hospice in.
Katrin County thank you Mr
speaker thank you kindly thank
you generally think generated
this further debate the
gentleman from Cibola and
McKinley Representative Alcon.
Thank you Mr speaker with the
gentle lady from Los Alamos
field yes I will gladly yield to
kind gentleman thank you to the
lady in my area because the Rico
program the radiation.
Exposure whatever pro is on the
whole thing goes through we have
a lot of a home health care
providers.
that were taking care of a.
Are you remember for sure.
And the.
A lot of these people are a the
provider the home health care
providers sometimes there's
almost always a reality that
even the life of the.
A division.
It is.
The thing is that the office the
is the provider they were.
For a the.
Word for word office for firm
that hires them to provide the
care for the patient.
So then not.
The office the main office
itself is in requests however
the care is provided in Milan.
To me that the main office is in
requests and I think the.
Heard this question earlier is
that means that they pay the
taxes in requests or do they pay
the tax for the actually do the
work.
Mr speaker and someone under
current law it would be where
they currently do the work
under the proposal Mr speaker
and gentleman it would be where
the office of the business is Mr
speaker and gentleman.
So that in in my case meaning
that we have a motivation chair
in Milan.
Our only the city a grants and
get the benefit of the tax.
Mr speaker and someone in the
county and I have a question Mr
speaker and gentleman to you
and I'm sorry if I don't know
this is Milan an incorporated
city or it is part of another it
is an incorporated city Mr
speaker.
So yes.
The ability to move on the great
realism in Llanishen
incorporated really.
So I'm putting my thinking cap
on Mr speaker.
Mr speaker and gentleman and I
I'm happy to be corrected if I
get this wrong.
It's not clear to me that long
we get it would be the county
in which small lawn is located.
In my.
Well.
Mr speaker and gentle lady up
there is going to be a city deck
somewhere I'm in the office the
main office like I said is in
requests the word the version
that's hired to do the work is
working in Milan.
Okay so wanted to do one
government entity or another
should qualify for.
For the tax on this not just the
county.
Mr speaker and gentleman I hear
you.
I I think I answered your
question correctly but don't
hold me to it Mr speaker and
gentleman.
So I think we Mr speaker and
gentle lady I think you did a
new breed basically told me the
City of drugs would get the
better the whole benefit of
this.
Yes this other one question Mr
speaker and gentle lady what
happens to all those requests
and the work is done on the
pueblo.
Under ask about I go now we're
on the Navajo Nation.
Is there a gross receipts tax
assistance.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
If this bill were to pass I
think I could fair confidently
say it would be in the city
where the provider is.
Mr speaker and gentleman under
current law.
I don't know why seeing.
There would.
The nose County G. R. T. because
it is on a sovereign nation.
I don't know if the Pueblo has a
G. R. T. that would apply that's
what I cannot answer Mr speaker
and thank you for these hard
questions gentleman.
You see a up Mr speaker the
gentle lady I I guess Hughes to
the people I in the adopted
these people all the time a lot
of these people get a ten ninety
nine at the end of the year okay
he's saying their self employed.
And they also get a suddenly
jump a lot of them suddenly get
a rude awakening as they get
this bill from Jackson read of
the for all the gross receipts
that there's a bill that they
had no idea that the them until
they get the.
Bill.
So they're making fifty grand a
year that's a I'm done on this
route in office using fifty
thousand federally they get a
bills from attacks and Revenue
the right the the.
Thanks in rural with a sense of.
And the so I see it all the time
and the I think they're a fairly
or unfairly I I don't know how
to handle it I mean the only
thing I can tell them when they
actually is.
You have to beta test but.
And then this would be would be
people that live and whatever of
that'll get a tax bill from
action revenue.
Though we confused of seeing
this happening over and over
again and and I.
Again like other people like I
know there's other services that
are thanks to the administered
only covers long little piece of
the world that we live in and
the.
Let me let me in that's all it
is is just wrong thing in this.
Thanks world that we live in and
I'm wondering why just that one.
So you can enjoy it because you
didn't enter Representative
Nibert the new madam and the
other one so I'm not going to
wait for dentures thank you Mr
speaker and madam.
Santa.
Thank you gentleman next to the
generally for many
Representative Brown.
Thank you very much Mr speaker
will the gentle lady from Los
Alamos recovery the Santa in
Santa Fe please yield Mister
speaker gentle lady I will
yield.
Thank you very much Mr speaker
and gentle lady so.
Hi I think there are some of the
history on this bill it's not of
the change wasn't all that long
ago it was in twenty nineteen
that the legislature passed
house bill six and I I think our
focus as it's been stated was
mostly on internet sales and
news is our to capture some of
that tax revenue
the part about destination
sourcing was later in the bill
and I don't think it was really
debated all that much anyway
we used to have before this bill
passed in twenty nineteen we
used to have origin based
sourcing sourcing taxation
meaning wherever the business
was located is of that is the G.
R. T. right that applied to
services or goods regardless of
where those were shipped or
delivered.
So Mister speaker gentle lady on
July first of twenty twenty one
just a few months ago the new
law went into effect.
And it wasn't very long before I
started hearing from a number of
businesses especially home
health care businesses hospice
and so forth.
That this was creating a
hardship for them because now.
They had to bill the G. R. T.
rate of
that applied in to the
destination of the service or
good good so
there's some complexity there
and I I really believe Mr
speaker gentle lady to
businesses really do want to get
this ride they they do want to
be accurate in their reporting
but now there's just so much
more to track and
Mr speaker gentle lady some
people have kind of dismiss the
issue or the problem and just
said well there's software to
help them calculate all those
things I'm not a believer
believer that that's really the
case right now and that software
may even be more expensive in
some businesses but that's an
issue that's still up in the
air.
So Mr speaker gentle lady the
the problem with house bill six
from twenty nineteen is that is
it causing many cities in New
Mexico in particular city's to
lose out on gross receipts tax
revenue.
And I I believe that many
members of this body may not
know the impact or effect that's
occurring in their own districts
with businesses that provide you
know of services or goods not
just in the immediate locales.
So Mister speaker gentle lady
there's been a big effort that's
been started to a look at the G.
R. T. data with with the clothes
are and to analyze the data and
one of the problems I think
we're seeing is people say oh D.
G. R. T. is up everywhere will
that's probably due to the
internet sales tax collection
but we need to disaggregate that
of those data from what we're
what we're normally sing and
it's even worse than that Mr
speaker and gentle lady because
we had a very a typical couple
years here or we had a pandemic
lockdown and a lot of businesses
lost revenue but now the
economy is picking up and so
we're looking at G. R. T. right
collection going up but that
doesn't really tell the story
because we were that such a low
level for those two years.
So Mr speaker and gentle lady I
think the point I'm standing to
make tonight is that all of us
legislators need to come up to
speed on this issue.
And the Mr speaker gentle lady I
I did sign on to the bill
I think that if we pass it will
set a precedent for helping all
the other companies that are
that are not you know that their
taxes going to a location other
than municipality where they
operate have their headquarters
so.
Mr speaker gentle lady I I'm not
very Center sympathetic to
hospice and home health care and
all that but I'm also
sympathetic to all the other
the municipalities in particular
that had a big drop in revenue.
So
Thank you gentle lady Mr speaker
for bringing this bill forward
again I think it's a looming
issue for all of us we need to
understand it understand the
impact on our own districts and
be ready to come in and and do a
bigger fix than just providing
an exemption for for this one
industry although I think this
is a baby step and I appreciate
that gentle lady Mr speaker
thank you so much.
The generators to the gentleman
from Chavis Eddy and Otero
Representative Townsend.
Thank you Mr speaker of the
gentlelady yields.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes I
will yield.
The lady as.
If you will know
That the.
Internet sales taxes because
this all a little grief
In one hand we accept them and
then the other hand we.
Probably didn't do very well of.
I was told earlier that the.
The Senate.
Majority Leader said he did not
support this bill are you aware
that.
Mr speaker and gentleman I heard
that there was a conversation a
committee where that was that Mr
speaker and gentleman.
That Mr speaker in July that's
exactly what I heard.
You know we have lawyers and
accountants already exempted
before.
Health care and hospice.
And then I was asking my friend
behind me.
About another issue that I know
is significant and that is.
For example in the tourney in
Midland.
Working on.
minerals in.
Eddy County.
Does they.
Loose.
Tax base on that means.
Is tax collected on that and the
answer was very probably not.
And then that goes and all sorts
of other things that we're doing
down south.
And I would tell you that I
think we're missing the boat on.
A lot of stuff that is used to
comes out of taxes into the
Permian and.
Is not collected.
I'm worried that.
This is going to cause a lot of
problems with with
municipalities on additional
call back.
Do you share that concern the
gentle lady.
Mr speaker and gentleman if you
could elaborate as to what you
mean.
Twelve and will TRD look at.
The taxing policy and because.
Counties to be responsible for.
There misunderstanding.
And they will do they will call
back taxes that they that they
send to the vaccine municipality
because they don't believe they
had the administered their tax
policy.
As the law.
Is is
currently understood by those
municipalities am I making sense
and gentle lady Mr speaker and
gentleman I am respectfully say
no.
well I could even through the
mask on your face I could see
that of.
And.
There there is a great concern
out there that the claw backs
from TRD.
Will be accessible to
municipalities because the
mis understanding of the
application of the new tax law
and that shared by many
municipalities.
I was just wondering.
And I know this is your bill and
it's on the floor and it has
support I I'm I'm by members on
my side as well.
Should we try to fix it before
we send it over to the Senate.
And
them do something to it that we
on the last day have to concur
not concur with.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
I'm very confused by this call
back issue that you raised.
Certainly counties and cities
are often.
I say this involved in
discussions with the state on
what the appropriate calculation
is that's not a new thing Mr
speaker and.
Beyond that.
Your discussion here is that
okay I say this respectfully Mr
speaker and you pretty far
beyond what my bill is involved
with so for me to have to talk
to you about clawbacks on a
whole array of G. R. T. issues
is a little bit beyond my
preparation for this
conversation Mr speaker and
gentleman and I understand that
Mr speaker and gentle lady and
and I knew but my point was your
bill is I believe a good deal
and it addresses and issues.
But there are many more issues
out there that are similar that
affects the state and
municipalities and.
Although your bill fixes ace a
car about.
There are a lot of the there are
many others left and and many
municipalities are hurting
because of it
so.
That is my point I think your
bill's going in the right
direction.
But there's a hole in it and it
bothered me when I heard that.
The majority leader over in the
Senate didn't like it but
because we might lose it too and
I was just going to try to.
I'll offer up maybe we ought to
fix it and get some.
Some understanding on the on the
problems on that side where we
didn't have a problem and didn't
lose the whole bill so that was
my point Mr speaker gentle lady
thank you.
There's further debate the
gentleman chair is the result.
Independently Anderson.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Will the lady yield.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Travis county I have those
Roosevelt and blue.
Madam okay Madam is you know I
voted for this bill and the
health committee.
And today on the floor I heard
the concept the.
Calls me to give this some
thought that I will get to my
question first question is did
we hear in the tax committee or
the health committee the
position of either the municipal
league or the association of
counties Mr speaker.
Chairman.
Mr speaker and gentleman I
certainly cannot speak to a.
Was said in the health committee
I don't recall and I certainly
don't recall either of those
entities taking a position what
excuse me at one point I believe
the association up excuse me New
Mexico counties are not called.
Spoke against but they have
dropped their opposition to this
this bill.
Thank you for that Madam because
it helps me now.
Mr speaker in the debate today I
heard a concept.
That really made me pause and
that is.
Somehow the small margins that
some businesses in New Mexico
operate on have now become part
of New Mexicos tax policy.
As opposed to.
Perhaps businesses that provide
services that enjoy a greater
margin could you Mr speaker
madam please comment for one
side misunderstanding the debate
Mr speaker and gentleman.
You are misunderstanding the
debate and extending it will be
Lujan well the on Mr speaker and
gentleman anything that I
intended to imply it was merely
an observation Mr speaker that
the home care business it is an
essential and critical support
system for families in need in
the state and as a tangential
points I pointed out that they
operate on very tight margins
some cases and then rely on
Medicaid pays gentlelady coupons
for second we're hearing this as
a gas leak or something and I
want to have a quite near for
second.
The speaker the speaker.
Okay will we do that just to
know everybody for the rest of
the session sorry the Russian.
just okay sorry for the
originally we just wanted to
make sure we were not at all Mr
yes I'd rather be allies and
the.
Thank you thank you for that
answer because it it didn't
really strike me that I heard a
the divergence on.
On the methodology in which we
will call Kaul holes in the
cheese of the gross receipts tax
in New Mexico and being a
proponent of a strong base and
one that is is trades service
providers and providers of of
goods E. coli
is more where I was headed and I
appreciate your response and
with that Mr speaker on to thank
you gentleman this further
debate the gentle lady from
granted although and this year.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
delivery okay I will yield I
think.
I think this is a perfect
example of a bill that we all
thought accomplished one thing
and that was taxing internet
sales it is that it wasn't an
area that I had expertise honor
that I understood the language
when they talked about the
destination sourcing of
services.
So it was.
Pretty much dominated the entire
conversation was about internet
sales that we found there are
some technicalities that have
really had a negative impact on
some providers and and it was
almost immediate when the rules
were promulgated that we started
hearing from folks and and I
actually
the next several members from
the minority office in April of
twenty one Representative
letters and said this is a
problem.
We got to fix this and I'm
really glad that you brought
this bill forward because
particularly for home health
care.
Hospice.
And and so many folks across the
state are losing access to
nursing home facilities one just
closed in Santa Rosa.
Percent yes Senator.
and summer hanging on by a
thread so not only is it this is
this is critically important.
And I'm really really excited
disappointed.
These days this is the only non
emergent health care provider.
That.
Is going to have to pay these
taxes the G. R. T. regulations
impact even if they're doing the
vaccine care the hospital acute
care or nursing facility does
then not subjected to the same.
G. R. T. so these are usually
smaller organizations and their
local organizations and they
have this gives them an
additional administrative burden
that we're gonna be able to
really from them so I'm it
created just a lot of
complexity.
I just know that the folks in my
area want to stay in their homes
as long as they possibly can
they want to live independently
as long as they possibly can and
so.
I think that we need to make
these necessary changes and.
I agree with Representative
brown that this is setting
precedent because we are picking
a winner and today the winter
are available populations who
want to stay close to home close
to their family and live
independently as long as they
possibly can that's a really
good one but we also need to
acknowledge the impact that it's
had on any other industry
negative negative industry to
communities.
We're almost most of our
counties forty percent of their
operating budget comes from G.
R. T. and there are some
industries and some counties
that in so heavily hit by the
way this is being collected that
this
This is happening and that has
support is something that we've
been asking for for over a year
and Mr speaker and gentle lady I
want to thank you for bringing
the bill and I'm looking for to
voting for it.
Thank you generally next to the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
Representative Thompson.
Thank you Mr speaker to the
gentle lady from Los Alamos
field Mr speaker gentle lady I
definitely yield thank you I've
been sitting here listening and
there's been a lot of talk about
what you didn't include is there
anything that precluded other
members from doing bills to
include those things.
Mr speaker gentle lady
as far as I know there's nothing
precluding anyone from dropping
any sort of bill on any kind of
topic that it relates to the
state of New Mexico Mr speaker
and gentle lady thank thank you
Mr speaker and gentle lady I do
have a question it may be a
suggestion doesn't will this
include it says home health care
you all know that I used to be a
traveling pediatric physical
therapist and a school therapist
and I'm wondering if the and and
a lot of the school therapists
are contractors that travel from
Albuquerque to other places so
I'm wondering are those people
kind of included in that.
Mr speaker gentle lady would you
describe the service a little
more specifically I'm sorry I
was looking AT is eligible to
pay attention would be I'm
particularly therapists speech
therapists occupational physical
trouble like I worked in the
grant schools for couple years I
worked in Amos valleys as a
contractor for a couple years
and then I also did infants and
toddlers through the family
infant toddler program in I mean
I in those days I could do three
counties in one day so I'm
wondering if that
If those people would be
included.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
don't think so truthfully I did
give you an honest answer it
focuses more on home health
services and that's defined as
skilled intermediate and
medically necessary services
provided to a person in a
person's home and I'm gonna look
at my text messages Mr speaker
see if any of my advisors have
any response but hospice
services which I think are we
understand what those involved
and gentle lady Mr speaker I'm
the the family of a toddler
stuff is frequently done in the
family's home so I'm just
throwing this out there is
something you might want to
consider because they are
providing the same services just
for the day and also the
development disability waiver
types of providers thank you Mr
speaker and gentle lady Mr
speaker thank you gentle lady.
Okay the gentleman from
Bernalillo civil on McKinley
circle San Juan and once you.
Representative Harry Garcia.
Others for the debate on this
bill the gentleman from Dominick
Dunne Adam grant zero percent
and that also is.
Sorry I was having trouble
I'm using this first Mr speaker
gentle lady so I just want to
thank you for reading this
legislation I did have a couple
questions and I've been
listening to.
The
Question from the other all
members one of my questions was
does this affection of
the way and I just I'm sorry
central my internet connection
so I promise you that let me get
you here with the address of the
from the Mr speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
I cannot sing of anyway that
would affect copper mining Mr
speaker and gentleman.
Thank you of Mr speaker gentle
lady I just I I know I heard
something about oil and gas and
some other things so I just
wanted to see and I heard that
they were trying to include
other businesses but this
specifically is just for hospice
and home health which I truly
appreciate Mr speaker gentle
lady I work with them hand in
hand so I understand how that
would help them
I was I was actually but anyway
I'll just leave it at that Mr
speaker Sir William sorry
because my in our direction I
didn't hear some of the
discussion I had already lowered
my hand and I still got called
so thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady.
Mr speaker Tallman good to hear
from you and you miss some
really exciting stuff here on
the floor.
It sounds that way we Mr speaker
gentle lady.
Okay the German firm curry
Representative Crowder.
Thank you Mr Spiegel gentle lady
from Los Alamos in those other
counties please yield Mister
speaker I will yield to the
gentleman thank you generated
generated the the Joneses just
spoke Mr trials this said he was
related his business is very
much related to some of the
businesses that you're dealing
with so I guess I have a
question did you consider or
should funeral homes and funeral
services to be included in this
are are they included in this or
what your thoughts on that.
Mr speaker gentle and so glad
you asked that question.
No.
Mr speaker kind gentleman I said
no okay there was a very quick
answer and and someone was
chatting about here the agency
that so but thank you very much
so I I guess is someone else's
mentioned that perhaps the
funeral services could be a
different bill but just was
curious the other question I had
I know that there's a lot of
difficulty between the cities
and the counties and and the
small communities in the larger
communities and.
Who's getting that taxes and
getting that tax all.
Would it be reasonable to
consider allowing the businesses
to choose just like they choose
whether they pay monthly or
quarterly or semi annually would
be reasonable to allow other
businesses to choose whether
they pay the city tax for the
county tax or whatever.
Mr speaker and gentleman the
record keeping nightmare
associated with that I would
imagine to be insurmountable Mr
speaker and gentleman I'm sorry
Mr speaker gentle lady I could
just barely hear you I'm.
Mr speaker and gentleman I would
imagine that the record keeping
and tracking and enforceability
of such a system would be
prohibitive Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Okay I and I appreciate that it
in could be I I would think that
once a business if they had a
loyalty to community or
something if they chose to use
that one and that could.
Have that be their of place of
paying taxes of record
it seems to be a little bit the
logical to me and I was just
curious what your thoughts were
Mr speaker that's all my
questions thank you.
Thank you gentlemen.
I
no further debate the gentle
lady to close.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you body for the what I think I
found it interesting debate

but

action necessary for placing.
House.
House bill fifty two on final
passage has been taken it is now
subject to debate amendment and
substitution.
Gentle lady to explain the bill.
Mr speaker we get you to that
point.
I did.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Today we have on the floor today
house bill fifty two and it does
to really.
Or and things by amending.
Harm reduction act that was in
place to put in place in
nineteen ninety seven first it
grants its authority to the
Mexico department of health to
decide on supplies that would
help manage and.
communicable communicable
diseases and second.
It's.
Criminalizes drug testing
devices under the the the
current definition of
paraphernalia.
Here are facing a crisis today
Mister speaker with the opioid.
The Democrat conventional being
one of the leading causes of
death.
With adults from the ages
eighteen to forty four years
old.
We know that.
We had the opportunity last year
to an act this piece of
legislation.
And we also know that by not
enacting of his elation
legislation
We possibly.
Lost lives and from the data
that we've received there have
been over three hundred lives
this past year that.
We're loss due to fentanyl drug
use overdoses.
So this is probably one of the
most critical pieces of
legislation that we're going to
have to vote on in front of us
today Mr speaker.
And I asked.
All of us here today.
To reflect on their communities.
The information has come forward
in this crisis.
Knowledge that this is the time
when we come together in a
bipartisan way to solve.
A critical issue.
And to save lives.
And to provide a method of
recovery for those that have
substance use disorders.
With that Mr speaker stand for
questions.
Senators for the debate on this
issue.
And what it from Travis county
Representative Ezzell.
Mr speaker good to see up there
like that picture Mr speaker
will the gentle lady from Santa
Fe yield please.
Mr speaker I will yield.
Mr speaker thank you very much I
do have several questions
regarding this.
This is called harm reduction
act amendments to whenever I'm
reading go over some of the.
Analysis and things it brought
to mind a lot of questions that
I hope you can answer Mr speaker
gentle lady whenever you were
taught this is new language
that's in this particular bill.
The.
It is.
The harm reduction program does
provide participants with
sterile needles and syringes
that's already in the bill right
now tell me what the other
objects are that is new language
the the paraphernalia.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
Right now that that is what the
program has in effect what this
bill does in the man's is it
allows for other drug testing
devices to be added to.
To be used.
Generating.
Well my concern is for.
Testing for drugs for what.
Is a street drugs that we're
testing is that prescribed drugs
that we're testing what is it.
Mr speaker generally thank you
for that question it is all the
of all of the above.
In particular the crisis of
fentanyl we're finding that this
opioid fentanyl being laced and
added to many
drugs that are already on on in
the drug market so to speak and
being used widely and so this
would allow for devices like
test strips which would test for
fentanyl in any substance.
Mr speaker gentle lady thank you
for that explanation whenever
you are talking about tennis
trips.
How are they of fix to whatever
is being tested can those strips
be re used.
Mr speaker gentle lady no.
Mr speaker gentle lady I hope
not because some drugs sure out
there could ultimately get their
hands on that particular strip.
Says Hey look at this is been
tested but the state of New
Mexico and it's not bad for you
go ahead and take it so if I can
be assured that the strips.
Cannot be re used in any way
shape or form and I do have my
doubts that that is the case I'm
concerned Mr speaker and gentle
lady whenever we're talking
about supplies and devices.
That are approved by the
department and that's all new
language tell me what that is
explained that to me please.
Mr chair madam.
In related I'm going to ask my
expert witness.
Mr speaker gentle lady those
devices would be used to
decrease the amount of overdoses
and usage of these substances.
Mr speaker gentle lady I guess
I'm not quite following that if
these people are using illicit
drugs.
The state of New Mexico is going
to give them apparatuses that
will now say Hey don't take over
this amount of the illegal drugs
is that what I'm hearing you
say.
Mr speaker Matt gentle lady it's
not going to tell them the
amount which is going to
indicate whether the substance
is present or not Mr speaker
gentle lady.
Okay have got concerns about
this to.
Mr speaker and gentle lady on
page let's see what is the to
Page three down on the bottom
starting online twenty four
continuing on twenty five.
Going on to the top of the page
for his C. is that this all
falls under be the department
shall appoint an advisory
committee to include it gives
all these others and then down
at the very bottom under six
under a number six esses other
persons or representatives as
chosen by the secretary of
health to ensure a thorough and
unbiased evaluation of the
program established under the
harm reduction act.
Mr speaker gentle lady my
concern is are we trying to do
the public into believing that
the department of health is
actually doing something to come
combat illegal drug use and I
think that's the direction we're
heading why do we need to have.
More people.
I I'm not quite following that
train of thought since that the
but we have the office of the
Attorney General state police
listed in Texas disease
prevention and control bureau
the director of epidemiology or
the directors designate a
medical officer and then it's
just other people.
Does that need to be more
specific Mr speaker and gentle
lady.
Is.
A lady the the language looking
at is already in place under the
harm reduction act and with this
program is about is is has it as
it relates to public health.
And Representative the harm
reduction that it provides
recovery solutions Mr speaker
gentle lady.
Mr speaker gentle lady that
really didn't answer my question
we're just gonna add that other
people in there okay I'm I'm
really committees but that
language Mr speaker gentle lady
some of the other questions I
have of.
I guess my concern is.
The taxpayers of the state of
New Mexico really understand
that they are paying for this
drug paraphernalia did they
really understand that.
Madam chair Mister chair on
generating the taxpayers I
believe do you understand that
the money that that is at hand
here is to save lives and for
good public health policy Mr
speaker gentle lady I think that
they may not understand it fully
I don't think that they
understand that they're paying
for syringes for illegal drug
use that they are paying for now
paraphernalia if that the
department of health is going to
be providing the fire we
providing all this material
instead of right going to the
cause of the problem and helping
to subside illegal drug use
that's my concern and as a
taxpayer of the state I do have
concerns with the why is the
Mexico not addressing are
illegal drug use here in the
state that's my concern Mr
speaker thank you very much.
Okay seeing there's further
debate the gentleman from Lee
County Representative Pettigrew.
You Mr speaker does the gentle
lady yield.
Yes Mr speaker I will yield to
the gentleman.
Mr speaker the first thing I
want to say is I appreciate the
passion in the in the push for
this.
From from you from yourself and
from Representative Hochman
Vigil understand the personal
stories.
The that go along with this.
So I'm gonna try and do this in
such a way that it doesn't make
the works in the and I
appreciate that.
For Blue.
Mr speaker and of.
The lady.
Representative Ezzell from
Travis county several of the
questions I wanted to from
renewable labor that.
On the.
They do want to call your
attention to page three I will
be starting at line to.
With the the regional language.
The talks about the visor re
committee.
Mr speaker and gentle lady tell
me with respect to the original.
Act what year that was
implemented.
Thank you.
Sir speaker and gentleman that
this act initiative which was
initiated in nineteen ninety
seven under then governor
Johnson.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady.
According to this document in
the unedited pieces of the state
on page for the advisory
committee.
Close to develop policies and
procedures.
For evaluation of harm reduction
program.
Continuing on the line six
develop criteria for data
collection and program
evaluation.
And not including the new
material right now line eight it
is necessary.
To analyze data and produce a
report.
On the harm reduction program.
Mr speaker and gentle lady would
like to ask specifically since
nineteen ninety seven.
Twenty.
For twenty five years.
Four million four they learned
what values.
In this have we received from
this Advisory Council committee
that actually suggests that we
should add more documentation to
their process and.
Trust that they're gonna complex
that.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman that's a good question
and I'd like to again reiterate
that.
New Mexico department have harm
reduction program is one of the
best in the nation.
And we should be proud of that
because we have science based
data and information at our
hands over the last twenty five
years you get through this
program and through other
programs that have helped
initiate Sheet� across the
United States.
This program saves lives.
This program provides
opportunity for recovery which
saves lives.
This program shows in it can be
proven that.
When access is available and
education that those seeking
recovery are five times more
likely to.
Find recovery program and the
cover.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
I don't see anything in the task
list for.
The committee to develop or
evaluate recovery.
Mr speaker
can you rephrase the question
I'm sorry repeated.
Internally thank you just talked
about.
Assisting with
The drug problem towards
recovery as I go through the
committees task list serves to
develop policies procedures to
evaluate a harm reduction
program.
No no recovery in that.
Develop criteria for data
collection.
And program evaluation recovery
doesn't exist there.
It is the same with item number
three so as we talk about the
recovery side where with the
tasks to actually do that in the
original bill would what is your
expectation with the amended
bill for the amended legislation
to the statute how do we get
there.
Thank you Mr speaker
Judgments.
So what the program does is they
report to us and they have been
over the last twenty five years
and from that data and
information gathering then we
can infer thank find other
information pieces and
understand for the need is what
is causing the issue around
substance use disorder what is
it that we have some outcomes
measurable outcomes and that's
what this program achieves by
their reporting and collecting
data and information.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady for that soon
I understand that they report to
us.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
Is there some place that I'm
supposed to intuitively know
where to go to get that report
or do they actually bring it to
me.
Mr speaker and gentleman that
information is reported to the
Legisla- the LFC on a quarterly
basis.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
generally so.
That information Mr speaker and
gentle lady also reported to our
county officials to our county
sheriff's to our local.
Medical facilities has that
information pushed out been
given out.
So that people don't intuitively
have to know that they need to
go to the LESC website.
Mr speaker and gentle lady thank
you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen.
At information like this is is
not intuitive.
And it is public information and
therefore widely available to
those seeking the information
and and that's into the
weirdness that we.
And those that work in these
official capacities would
provide them the opportunity to
provide that information.
Okay thank you Mr speaker thank
you gentle lady for that answer
I asked people in my community
and they're unaware of those
reports so I do appreciate that
and.
Mr speaker gentle lady as a as a
point of order community sure
professional I apologize Mister
speaker thank you so much I'd
like to introduce areas showers
who's the policy director from
the New Mexico department of
health.
Thank you very much Mr speaker
thank you gentle lady so
Mr speaker gentle lady.
Your bill's specifically calls
out and just for your your
suggests the legislation.
Yes Representative from from
Travis county talked about
others objects supplies and
devices to test drugs and
supplies and devices approved by
the department.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
Is it safe to assume.
That there's somewhere on the
LESC website that I can find a
report that suggests from this
advisory committee this is the
next appropriate step.
Mr speaker generally this is new
this is a new part of this this
bill this ammendment so.
At guess I'd ask for some
clarification in your question.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady to be very specific
I understand that they the.
The only the the the vytorin
Committee since nineteen ninety
seven has been providing reports
on a quarterly basis to LFC.
Is it safe to assume in recent
reports there has been a very
specific.
Direction from the department of
health for this Advisory Council
says.
We need to amend this bill or we
need to in the statute which
would be.
parts of twenty four to C. two
and twenty four two C. six.
Chapter two chapter two fifty
six sessions to prove true and
six women and acting some other
legislation as well through
their Mr speaker and gentle lady
can you point me specifically to
a report.
From the advisory committee
says this is what we need to do
next.
Mr speaker gentleman
Through the reporting from and
the the matrix of information
data collection and everything
yet.
That would be included in the
quarterly report and you have to
read through it and and get that
information but the real crux of
the crux of this piece of
legislation is to decriminalize
those supplies and to make sure
that
You're no longer considered drug
paraphernalia.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
I get that.
I understand what the crux of
the of of then the intent of
house bill fifty two is.
I'm asking can you point me very
specifically to a document that
says.
We need to make these changes
based on the data in the science
that we have collected over the
last twenty five years.
Thank you.
Thank you Mr speaker and and the
gentleman there are twenty one
other states that have enacted
the this type of legislation and
when we're looking at over three
hundred deaths and the deaths of
adults this being the number
one.
Of our adults aged eighteen to
forty four.
Those are hard data facts this
is this is a crisis that we are
facing right now if we do
nothing.
We're going to lose more lives
because of this substance use
disorder.
Early the use of fentanyl.
Mr speaker gentle lady I I I
appreciate.
The the numbers that that we
just for a.
There's twenty of one other
states that have something like
this yes we've had over three
hundred deaths I get that I'm
not.
Trying to debate the emotional
side of this.
Mr speaker gentle lady when I'm
trying to get to is where is the
data.
Backs up that says if we
decriminalize these items.
Mr speaker and gentle lady if we
decriminalize these things if we
do this the data says we're
going to help solve the problem.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman we know that.
The initial the initial reasons
why we enacted and pass the harm
reduction act was to save lives
we had H. I. V. of the damage we
had hepatitis C..
Representative.
And we saw the matrix of the
uses of of of syringes and we
saw the high in the numbers of
the diseases being passed on
because there weren't sterile
devices for them to use those
devices being syringes what we
see now.
Is that there is a decrease in
the usage of syringes and an
increase in the usage of the
smoking and and other ways of
ingesting the substances and.
Those those are data points as a
that is information that can be
found Mr speaker John.
Speaker gentle lady okay thank
you thank you for that response
but once again.
Where's the report from our
committee I don't care about the
other twenty one states.
Where's the report from the
advisory committee from the
department of health says this
is a logical next step because
of the science and because of
the data which is their job in
accordance with.
Section.
I don't see.
Going to page four.
Where's the report where's the
data.
Where can I get that data in the
report Mr I mean it Mr speaker
gentleman.
That.
Date information's been
gathering for quite some time
now so you have to go through
each quarterly report and the
get all those those facts
information pieces and.
ET themselves do not have an
annual rate of annual report its
quarterly reported.
To us so if you would like to
receive that information you
have to go to those quarterly
reports in the LFC which exist
and we need that information
thank you Mr speaker John.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady I
feel like we're dancing around
the tree right now.
The.
The point is we're being asked
to analyze and assess the piece
of legislation.
Based off of.
Multiple quarterly reports that
were asked to go for it fine on
our own.
In this sense of legislation is
that critical this that the next
most critical step for the state
of New Mexicos to do this why
isn't it in a report somewhere
that readily available.
The.
Mr speaker and gentleman I know
you're very focused on very just
one report.
However there's there's
multiple.
Information pieces that exist.
But we've had experts testify to
the the critical need of this
piece of legislation we have an
up tick of a hundred and thirty
six percent.
Overdoses and our state alone in
one year.
The data speaks for itself.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady again we're back to.
Let's let's go that way if if
we've had that uptick in
overdoses how does.
Decriminalizing other objects
supplies and devices.
To test for drugs.
Help.
In remove those overdoses.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman because then you can
test to know if that substance
is is present before you
ingested.
Mr speaker John.
Mr speaker German so I'm to
understand that.
The testing devices that we're
talking about.
Will help.
Someone that's addicted to know
what drug is in the in whatever
for substance they've got.
And.
And
We're assuming the that that
point in time the that person is
going to sit there and say no I
don't want this one I need to go
find something else.
Mr speaker German yes it will
help save their lives.
Mr speaker gentle lady
I'm being asked to the on a
piece of legislation where the
state of New Mexico is going to
do certain things and supply
certain things.
I talked with.
The New Mexico sheriff's
affiliate.
They completely oppose this
legislation.
It keeps them from being able to
get them into a drug
rehabilitation program.
And.
They look at the advisory
commission here.
I I would think the.
Maybe that some point in time in
this legislation we get some of
the bureaucrats often we get
some of the people in that can
actually help.
Push that legislation on top of
that Mr speaker and gentle lady
I think is probably a very good
time.
And not a waste of a.
Of our public dollars.
To go to page three.
Line seven and actually get that
annual report.
And show that that led New
legislation we have actually
follows the intent of that
report with that Mr speaker
gentle lady I yield back.
There is further debate the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
Santa Santa Fe Representative
Lord.
Thank you Mr speaker and will
the representative from Santa Fe
County please yield.
Speaker yes I will yield to the
gentleman.
It's very strange speaking to
all of your from like about the
speakers I'm Mr speaker.
Representative.
I just want to say to you
I'm I'm gonna explain to people
why I'm voting yes on the cell
okay.
This is a band aid I get that
but it's a very important
mandate because.
Well right now is the number one
killer United States between
eighteen forty five and that is
a fact and it's a huge issue in
my district of Berlin county.
Tell you I have the most
wonderful friends in the world
they're going on tonight they
just in text message and these
are people this is why it's
important not to judge people
over to profile them but my
friends are in biker
organizations and their biker
clubs and they actually go out
once a week to try to help these
people the minister them they
bring them to the Russians they
bring them to hygiene products
to numerous judges booklets
cover.
So they're going nineteen and
they do see people overdose they
have to go on with the I think
it's called the market on second
set correctly because they have
people overdosed in front of
them.
And this is a huge huge issue
in Berlin county and I'm sure
across the state where is it
going to Senator when no but.
The bigger problem is the
biggest problem.
Mr speaker and and
Representative as you know.
It is this is just part of so
many other issues.
We get the Mr
the people that I know that are
going out on the street are
actually we use those tricks
they actually reached out to let
me know that they would be taken
with them they go out they can
get access to them so they will
be used to try and help save
lives.
Your issue and I hope my biggest
fear is that.
With the money that we discuss
all these issues only in dollars
money.
Hope that we focus on some of
the biggest issues in our state
and.
We have many effects but one of
them is we have a mental health
so.
Yes some of the other peoples
questions they have about what
is doing and it's actually going
to go to my friends and they get
access to Josh to use them to
give to people because these
people are overdosing on fat
Health constantly out on the
streets and it is a huge issue.
I hope.
I guess the question.
Hearing Representative.
The reason I'm supporting this
is because settle it is here I
mean it's the number one seller
is that this is what's killing
everybody the most.
And anything that we can do to
try to help those in any way
however the bigger picture
really is.
It comes from China it comes
from Mexico comes across the
border with to stop that we need
more mental health we need more
rehabilitation and this is one
T. tiny little part but if it
helps people out in the street
then
I support this no question there
whatsoever and I just want to
tell everybody by exporting this
so thank you Mr speaker and our
Representative.
Si no further debate the gentle
lady to close.

three.

Thank you Mr speaker.
Mr speaker I can introduce the
bill now that's okay well that
gets getting up loaded.
I can I can talk about the bill
while we wait is are you want to
talk about the amendment.
Talked ability to please proceed
thank you Mr speaker house bill
sixty five modernizes our
current housing code in
particular with landlord tenant
law this is a bill that this
body has seen in the past
session and unfortunately did
not get through the Senate just
because we ran out of time so
nothing new in this bill the
amendments that were making just
simply clarify what we discussed
with house judiciary to be very
clear about the intent of our
bill from we get to our the
amendment will discuss that this
bill does three.
For important things one in
thank expands time frames to
allow tenants to be able to cure
the any rents
payment that they may have from
three days to eleven days
currently we have some of the
shortest time frames in the
United States for one of eight
states that limits the time
frame to cure in this way so
this would help that it also
allows for tenants to prepare
for court giving them fourteen
to twenty one days instead of
just seven days which is current
law.
And it also allows for
additional time to move at the
court's discretion the court can
allow for more time if a tenant
requires a being that they may
have some trouble finding new
housing.
Is it
Finally this basically allows
courts to help renters
understand their rights as as as
renters and prevents landlords
from refusing to renew a lease
during a declared state of
emergency with that Mr speaker I
can happy to explain the
amendment I understand it's
online.
Thank you gentle lady to
Illinois to explain amendment to
two two four two four point
three thank you Mr speaker this
amendment is what was promised
to from house judiciary for the
house floor today it's simply
simply brings back old law to
clarify what the timelines are
on current law so that's point
one and point to just explains
that when there is a complaint
from a renter that to a utility
company that the renter X.
complains to the owners of the
owner understands what the
problem is and is alerted to
that issue before any
retaliation claim can be made
with that Mr speaker I'll stand
for questions.
Thank you Representative from
the gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln Representative Nibert to
do our due to a debate the.
Bill or the amendment.
Mr speaker I'm going to debate
both but right now the bait the
amendment.
If I may Sir.
I yield Mister speaker so I
really really gentleman in the
gentle lady yield.
Yield Mister speaker.
I was going to ask you the yield
after you answer my question but
Francis speaker gentle lady
thank you for for yielding
one of the pieces of paper on
everybody's just because of
amendment that I was going to
bring to accomplish a at least
part of this and so I appreciate
the gentle lady of listening to
the comments and in Judiciary of
making those changes I fully
support this amendment what it
does for the body.
As it was written and as I was
explaining committee the change
was apparently made to clarify
the language but impacted the
didn't clarified it probably
made it a little ambiguous so
this amendment restores the
original language which is very
clear so I appreciate the Mr
speaker I appreciate the gentle
lady making that change that I
will support your amendment
funded.
Thank you John.

The gentle lady from Bernalillo
Sandoval in Santa Fe

We are now stepped forward
debate on the bill.
The gentleman from San Juan
County representative ruling.
Thank you Mr speaker Mr speaker
will the gentle lady from Santa
Fe currently yield I'll yield
Mister speaker.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady.
I want to talk first about
section three the changes made
to the deposit Mr speaker gentle
lady if you kind of turn their.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe.
Current law as I understand it
when it comes to.
The the item is ation letter
that needs to be sent within
thirty days from one of resident
vacates the home or the the Lee
six expires.
Current law all that it requires
is that.
You itemize any deductions for
damages or repairs is that
correct Mr speaker generated
from Santa Fe Mr speaker gentle
and that's correct Mr speaker
gentle lady from Santa Fe can
you explain the body what what
changes this bill makes to how
that thirty day item is ation
letter needs to not be handled
Mr speaker gentleman I'm so glad
you asked this
unfortunately and and current
law and the way in practice with
landlord tenant law.
Unfortunately some landlords are
withholds the
Deposit the brand deposit
without any sort of penalty or
information sent to a tenant
when the vacate the promises
this if effectively imposes a
penalty with two month two times
the monthly rent on the
landlords who retain a damage
deposit when they knowingly
violate the current provisions
of the law
it also codifies spring court
precedent that a landlord's
failure to serve a final
statement within those thirty
days does not bar the landlord
for making claims for rent and
utilities only for damages Mr
speaker gentleman.
Mr speaker generated from Santa
Fe so I think you're talking
about the resources that we case
from nineteen ninety six that
that kind of flushes out the
server the law.
but I think.
At least one difference in my
mind from the briefcase versus
what the statute does Mister
speaker.
Is I believe under Bruce under
that president you could see not
only the grant up to the day
that the tenant vacates but also
rent after that until you're
able to fill the vacancy the way
I interpreted this current bill
and is that you could only see
current up to the day that the
state is that correct.
Mr speaker gentleman just one
moment.
And Miss Mister speaker
gentlelady from Santa Fe I can
be of some help page six
subparagraph for.
Mr speaker gentleman if I'm
following you correctly if you
read through lines twenty one
through twenty five it says the
This allows the landlord to
forfeit the right to assert any
charge including rent other than
the minimum periodic payment due
under the lease for dwelling
accrued to the date.
Etcetera etcetera so it the or
whatever whichever is later.
Therefore Mr speaker gentleman
this clarifies that the date of
termination or the residents
departure whichever is later is
when the fees penalties it's
such a can be charged.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe and so just so the body
knows what what what we're
talking about is okay you're the
landlord and the tenant vacates.
Under the law you're supposed to
send me a thirty day items Asian
whether you fail to do that and
the question is Mister speaker.
What are your remedies as a
landlord to be able to retain my
deposit that's the context that
we're talking about here.
And I and I guess maybe this
this comes down to I think one
of the one the resident the
parts that's that's very clear
that's that's a date obviously
Mr speaker they vacate the
premises but maybe it's a
question of fact about the date
of termination because that is
that the same thing as
Whenever I vacate or is that one
the lease expires is that when
fires landlord I'm able to fill
the vacancy even police as an
expired.
Mr speaker gentle lady I just
get some clarification on that
Mr speaker gentleman this so if
the date of termination is today
but you don't leave until the
end of the week the end of the
day that you leave is the actual
day the of the that you depart
so whichever is later is is have
a cruel will work so if the date
on your.
contract is at the end of the
week and you leave today it's
still at the end of that
contract so whichever days
leaders how the fee is
determined to Mr speaker
gentleman Mr speaker gentle lady
from Santa Fe thanks for the
clarification.
Now.
Let me just ask Miss speaker
gentle lady are you familiar
with the resources that we K..
Service figure gentleman can
repeat the question Mr speaker
gentle lady from Santa Fe are
you very familiar with the
resources that we K..
Mr speaker gentle and polite me.
No I just I'm trying to
understand how much inflation my
questions of Mister speaker
gentle lady from Santa Fe
my recollection of that case and
it's been a few years since I
read it but is essentially the
reason put forth by our Supreme
Court as to why you don't have
to send a thirty day item is
ation letter for Mr rents and
late fees is because those are
objective the tenant is aware of
them whereas when you deduct
damages and repairs those may be
and may be in dispute and for
good reason and you're not
giving the tenant opportunity to
speak those things
Mr speaker gentle lady maybe
your expert can confirm that
that that's a fair assessment of
the case.
Your gentleman that's a fair
assessment.
Mr speaker generated from Santa
Fe the reason why I bring that
up as I notice in the changes to
this.
Bill is late fees.
Are no longer permitted.
If this bill gets signed into
law Mr speaker gentle it seems
to me if you're gonna allow Mr
rents so I missed last month's
rent under the contract also
have to pay a late fee but I
don't think under this currently
German title to that late fee as
the owner is that correct.
Mr speaker gentleman so first
point on this is that this only
pertains to those who did not
send of the thirty day note or
the date the notice right after
within the thirty day period
secondly with the comes to fees
and assessing those fees Mr
speaker gentleman the court
could determine what it is that
those fees would be and of
course the facts would have to
be understood as to why they
couldn't or could pay those
fees.
Mr speaker gently I I I think
you're right on the first point
I I don't think your afternoon
second point the reason why
state that is I think what this
link that says if you fill this
in the thirty day yeah you can
you can pursue grant.
Up to the date of termination
Senate budgets but basically of
bars everything else including
late fees Mr speaker just
generally is that correct Mr
speaker gentleman that's
correct.
So Mister speaker generated from
Santa Fe if.
Let me ask the question what's
the rationale for allowing me as
the owner if I don't send the
thirty day letter what's the
rationale for allowing me to
still pursue missed rental
payments.
Mr speaker gentleman going back
to your case Lauper's be out
away clarifies that this would
allow for ascertaining that
information and that can recover
that cost.
Mr speaker gentle lady so I mean
it it's it's objective clear to
both parties what the rain is
there's no dispute about that
and so it makes sense that you
would not so I have included a
thirty day a letter is that
correct.
Correct Mr speaker and gentleman
Mr speaker generated from Santa
Fe so I guess I have the same
question about late fees that
states objective thing standard
lease provisions of this ten
percent of the monthly rent due
and owing.
It's not something that squishy
like damages that the part is
going to speed is an objective
number of the lease has a late
fee provision and so Mister
speaker generated from Santa Fe
I'm wondering what's the
rationale for allowing me is the
owner of to pursue previous
rents owed that's an objective
number but not be able to pursue
the late fee which is also an
objective number.
Mr speaker gentleman so we going
back to step one you have to be
able to send that letter within
thirty days to basically let the
tenant know that you're charging
a late fee that is completely
allowed Mr speaker gentleman if
you don't find that information
you can't assess a late fee
after the fact because then of
course you're tacking something
on after thirty days that were
prohibiting from happening in
this bill Mr speaker gentleman.
The speaker generated from Santa
Fe actually the way every
residential lease agreement I've
ever seen.
I'm drafted or or either been a
tenant or or owner and the late
fees on mac I don't have to send
a letter to the tenant giving
them notice that Hey you failed
to pay you don't pay within such
or such a time a late fees in
the out of the those are
automatic.
Late fees Mr speaker gentle in
my been my missing something
there Mr speaker gentleman
unfortunately that's not the
loss or colleges for your
possible clients for that Mr
speaker gentleman because the
current law requires that you
have that in the thirty day
notice Mr speaker gentleman Mr
speaker gentle lady I I.
Another talking of the same
thing.
I'm talking about what you
haven't seen in the home.
Before they vacate.
Are you suggesting the law says
before I can charge a late fee
on a ten who still in the home.
That I have to send them notice.
Mr speaker and gentleman current
losses in section fifteen do if
the rental agreement provides
for the charging of a late fee
and if the resident does not pay
rent accordance with the rental
agreement the owner may charge
the resident a late fee in the
amount not to exceed ten percent
of the total rent payment for
each rental payment of the
resident is in the fall to
assess the late fee the owner
shall provide notice of the late
fee charge no later than the
last day of the next rental
period immediately following the
period in which the default
occurred Mr speaker gentleman
that is current law Mr speaker
gently which is a reading from
statutes or in the bill Mr
speaker gentle and I'm reading
from statute.
Mr speaker generally can you
give me the citation for the.
Mr speaker gentleman it's forty
seven forty seven slash eight of
fifteen do.
Mr speaker generated from
sentences subprogram the.
Mr speaker and gentleman D. as
in delta.
Mr speaker generally from Santa
Fe so.
I think my my point remains so I
think under the scenario.
Again we're talking about
objective numbers and so let's
say that I is a tenant failed to
pay rent.
The owner assesses away the sins
me notice I then vacate the
premises.
I'm trying to understand why
that late fee would not be for
civil with these changes.
Mr speaker gentleman first you
have to give notice of whatever
late fee or requiring if there
is no notice after the thirty
day period Mr speaker gentleman
this clarifies that you cannot.
You cannot request a late fee if
you haven't provided notice.
Mr speaker joined from Santa Fe
no one's suggesting is.
He gave notice to the tenant.
Misprint next cycle implying the
ten percent amount owed.
Two months down the road to
vacate the home.
I feel this in the thirty day
notice I can pursue the rent the
tenant had notice of the late
fee but this the statute
statutory changes not allow me
to pursue the late fee even
though the tenant had notice and
even though it's an objective
number some trying to understand
the rationale for that.
Mr speaker gentleman you have
the opportunity to send notice
within thirty days if that has
been proven and you've done that
there is no question that you
should be able to collect on the
late fees Mr speaker gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe I'm just asking what
the rationale is.
Mr speaker gentleman so that
there's no unexpected costs for
a tenant who does vacate the
promises or does end up leaving
the residence as soon as our
contract expires that somehow
what the way down the line after
thirty days they would somehow
need to be charged a certain fee
that comes after the fact Mr
speaker gentleman we just want
to make it very clear that a
landlord cannot.
Just a big charge no fees to
that tenant Mr speaker
gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady I think
under under that scenario is it
where the tenant they were given
notice but.
I move along I do want to say
one of the things I do like
about this bill is that allows
for the landlord to be able to
provide this this thirty day
letter via email Mr speaker
generally is that correct Mr
speaker gentleman that is
correct.
Mr speaker gentle lady because I
I know a lot of the times it's
if a tenant vacates you don't
know where they went they leave
in the middle and I kind of
thing you don't have affording
address but often times when
you're taken application for ten
and you'll get an email address
so I think this improves the law
to make sure that in fact
tenants are getting that notice.
I want to ask a question no on
page seven.
For graph he is an editor.
I noticed that we're removing
the bad faith standard.
For an owner who retains a
deposit deposit.
in violation of this section Mr
speaker generated from Santa Fe
can explaining the rationale for
removing the bad faith standard.
Mr speaker gentleman so two
reasons one it clarifies what
bad faith means and and the
second is that if the trial
lawyers across the state are
trying to make this very clear
what bad faith means the terms
now are just up to subject to
anyone's interpretation Mr
speaker gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe with I have some
concerns about removing the bad
faith
I don't know when we say knowing
is that personal knowledge is
that should have known knowledge
Mr speaker gentle lady can you
speak to that.
Mr speaker gentleman yes known
or should have known no no or
should have known.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe New I think that
highlights my my concern I I can
understand personal knowledge
that makes complete sense to me
should have known is more
troubling to me because now
we're talking about.
Not only.
Being able to not pursue amounts
owed but now we're talking about
the tenant being able to collect
twice the amount improperly
owed.
are improperly.
With held excuse me and so I
have some concerns when you take
away that bad faith and again I
think personals make sense but
should have knowing.
I think we're going to around
here were were owners who maybe
are very sophisticated Center
managing a rental on their own.
Are gonna be subject to this
provision Mr speaker gentle lady
maybe you can you can provide
some guidance
Mr speaker gentleman we were we
would just like every landlord
to follow the law Mr speaker
gentleman.
Speaker gentle gentle lady from
Santa Fe but it's it's more than
that.
Not assessing follow your
actually punishing them if they
fail to do this and it is the
same standard and in contract
you know you have a tentative
fills a veteran that's a
knowing.
Breach of contract but we don't
punish them with twice the
amount of.
so I I think we're setting up
some real land mines here for
Fund in knowing sort
unsophisticated owners.
I want to talk about the time
line changes that this bill
makes Mr speaker gentle lady
from from Santa Fe.
So under a typical please.
Cynara you have.
A tenant who misses the monthly
rental payments.
So by the time this time line
six offer starting already
thirty days of non payment.
Mr speaker gentle lady than the
law requires written notice of
that non payment.
And and can you share with us
what the changes on how long the
notice must be given
in order for the tenant become
current.
Mr speaker and gentleman two
things first on the last comment
regarding what we're asking of
the of landlords again when
you're running a business with
your have a contracts to bring
in money.
This is make ensuring that those
landlords meet the demands of
their own contracts as well and
that they follow the law again
with the cons with a contract
like that we just want to
protect both parties Mr speaker
gentleman as of the
Idea that we're extending
timelines Mr speaker gentleman
we are not changing any of the
current law as far as notice
goes Mr speaker gentleman we're
simply expanding the amount of
time that the that the landlord
first has at a time to queue or
between
When they're unpaid rent has
been has failed to win their pay
rent is been failed to pay from
three days to eleven days Mr
speaker gentleman.
Mr speaker Mr speaker gentle
lady from Santa Fe the problem
is you're not protecting both
parties are actually protecting
one of punishing the other so
the the notice and I'm talking
about speaks of the time frame
that most that a landlord must
give.
To the tenant of non payment
before the landlord can initiate
of.
An action against the tenant is
that correct.
Yes Mr speaker gentleman or
expanding that time line.
And Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe what is that time when
right now.
Mr speaker gentleman is only
three days Mr speaker gentle
lady from Santa Fe what changes
this bill made to that time
frame Mr speaker gentleman it
changes it from three days which
is one of the shortest time
lines in the country were only
one of eight states the only
allows for three days to eleven
days which is more in line with
what states are doing now to
allow tenants time to cure and
find that rental payment Mr
speaker gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe so once the landlord
either post a notice Sir four
delivers notice properly then
after eleven days then they can
file suit Mr speaker gentle is
that correct of this bill Mr
speaker gentle and that's
correct and Mr speaker gentle
lady from so let's say now the
The lawsuits been filed for Rett
restitution.
There's also a timing chain John
how.
Long the court has to wait to
have a trial in that case is
that correct Mr speaker
gentleman that's correct and Mr
speaker gentle lady what is that
time frame currently under the
law.
Mr speaker and gentleman it's
between seven to ten days.
And Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe what what change does
this bill makes to that
timeline.
Mr speaker gentleman it's
between fourteen and twenty one
days now.
For what we would like it to be
Mr speaker gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe and so continued on
this narrow.
Filed suit you get your day in
court the court rules in your
favor this this bill also
changes the timeline for how
long the tenant has to come up
with the rent that's due to sure
that default Mr speaker gentle
lady is that correct Mr speaker
gentleman yes that's the intent.
And Mr speaker gentle lady what
does.
This bill provide in terms of
that expanded timeline for for
building a look here the rand
after judgments entered.
Mr speaker gentleman this
provides fifteen to twenty days
for that rendered to be able to
receive that rent Mr speaker
gentlemen as you understand now
in our current economic
situation it's been very hard
for renters Mr speaker gentleman
to know that they have a stable
job things are unpredictable as
they are.
Currently in the markets renters
being some of the most
vulnerable people in our state
Mr speaker gentleman are just
asking for a little bit more
time to find that payment Mr
speaker gentleman Mr speaker
generated from Santa Fe junior
V. what the number was again.
Mr speaker gentleman fifteen to
twenty days.
Mr speaker generally from Santa
Fe maybe I'm reading than some.
Provisions at a contest can you
look at page nine one sixteen
through seventeen because I
thought it is expanded to twenty
one days going to get some
clarification please.
Mr speaker gentleman this
provision from lines twelve
through twenty four is specific
to a baited rents Mr speaker
gentlemen so this deals with.
Whether or not the court finds
that your basement was incorrect
this gives you twenty one days
to fix it Mr speaker gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe I thought subparagraph
one of the pages for rent
abatement.
Mr chairman that's correct as
well.
Mr speaker gentle anything show
we were encouraged to talk about
a basement.
Mr speaker gentleman so if you
look at section II following
wanted to they're meant to be
read together consistent for
what it's discussing which is
about updated rent also
discusses damages etcetera on
that basement but Mr speaker
gentleman they're meant to be
read together.
Mr speaker gentle lady I just
want to see the word for
it my interpretation is actually
usually the opposite of that
there two distinct.
Things I don't see the concept
of abatements a program to Mr
speaker gentle lady from Santa
Fe Romero missing something Mr
speaker and gentleman if you
didn't read it together one
makes sense they are consistent
with what we're discussing
within the entire section Mr
speaker gentleman.
I don't know how to help you
interpret that differently Mr
speaker gentle and.
Mr speaker gently from Santa Fe
so maybe I'm being a little slow
but that's not how I interpret
that that paragraph
anyways let's let's use the
number that you.
Mr speaker gentle lady the state
was fourteen days Mr speaker
gentle in a if you're discussing
the amount of days to provide
to be able to get you housing
and evicted it's fifteen to
twenty days which would be at
the court's discretion Mr
speaker gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe so.
When I want to add up those
numbers.
Assumption the tenants Mr weighs
thirty days worth of rent which
is which is pretty common.
And we've got the eleven days
for how long the notice has to
be given before action can be
initiated.
You've got fourteen days from
the date that action is
initiated for you can have a
trial setting and then from the
date judgments entered you get
another fourteen days Mr speaker
gentle lady that comes to
seventy days is that correct Mr
speaker gentleman that is
incorrect if you're even a daily
on run Mr speaker gentle in your
daily he can RT's commence
action Mr speaker gentle and.
Mr speaker delivers Senator can
you I'm sorry can you say that
again.
Mr speaker gentleman if you are
a day late on rent Mr speaker
gentleman the landlord can start
the process they can give you
notice they can commence with an
eviction at that time Mr speaker
gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe are you saying then.
You don't have to eleven days
from.
When notice is given forty file
action.
Mr speaker gentleman no you you
don't you just the they don't
have to wait thirty days before
they can give notice Mr speaker
gentleman.
No Mr speaker the only ones in
is let's say friends do on
general one.
Senate fails to pay rent the
last time he rate was on
December first.
So he misses the January payment
Mr speaker gentle lady so it's
been thirty days since I
received my rental payment
that's for the thirty day
calculation comes and Mr speaker
gentle lady Mr speaker gentleman
in your hypothetical you paid on
December first so if you wanted
to just commence action on
January second for unpaid rent
you could.
Mr speaker doing right so I'm
just saying on a practical
level.
Before you even get to the
eviction process going to
transmissible on month of rent
is that correct.
Mr speaker gentleman.
They would have missed a rental
payment Mr speaker gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe so it could be a seven
day final payment those are very
common the most common is a
thirty days so what I'm
suggesting is for most landlords
across the state they have a
tenant whose agency the thirty
days since the for the last
payment.
And you talk on the other
timelines and it comes to
seventy days so my question Mr
speaker generated from Santa Fe
is let's assume it's a it's a
month to month rent does that
number now come to seventy days.
Mr speaker gentleman that is
inconsistent with our timelines
Mr speaker gentleman.
Mr speaker generated from Santa
Fe so let's let's walk through
the got a month to month
tenancy.
But will the tenant and missed
the month so it's been thirty
days since the tenant made the
payment is that correct.
Mr speaker gentleman unless they
paid a rent payment yes.
Mr speaker gently from Senator
not trying to be combative and
I'm just trying to walk through
the Senator so it's been thirty
days since I made their last
payment.
The next time line is you have
to give them notice and they
have eleven days to go through
that before you can file an
action is that correct.
That's correct Mr speaker
gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe and then the the trial
Bill court has to give at least
fourteen days before they can
schedule here is that correct.
Yes Mr speaker gentle and Mr
speaker generally see hundred in
trial court has to give the
tenant at least fourteen days to
cure the default is that
correct.
Mr speaker gentleman so two
scenarios within that scenario
one the judge could decide that
this person needs to be evicted
and so they have to move out or
that tenant is able to cure
after fifteen days not fourteen
days and they can make the rent
payment Mr speaker gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady are you
are you saying that.
The judge doesn't have to give
them fifteen days to cure the
default.
Mr speaker gentleman they have
fifteen days to cure the default
for move out that's that's right
Mr speaker gentle and think
that's.
I think that's what I said.
Mr speaker John.
So Mister speaker generally just
doing the math.
Does that come to seventy days.
Mr speaker gentle and so you
start that counts the day these
miss the payment Mr speaker
gentleman so if we're just
talking about fifteen to twenty
days that is the length of time
that we're discussing in this
bill and in the scenario that
you gave whether or not they had
to leave the premises or they
were able to make the payment so
Mister chairman that is the
confines of what we're trying to
extend in particular for those
who just have a lack of payment
if they had any other cause for
eviction Mr chairman all that
will move forward that is
current law we don't change any
of that.
Mr speaker generated from Santa
Fe I guess I'm forgive me I'm
talking about the practical
implications of a bill it's
gonna have practical.
Consequences for real people and
so in the in the real world in a
month to month tenancy as the
owner.
We can talk about starting from
the day that they missed payment
but the reality is I also
haven't got a payment for thirty
days prior to that that factors
into people's thought process
when it comes to setting what
these rents are I'd like to talk
about
Page thirteen own retaliation.
Mr speaker gentle lady section
six of the bill.
Now Mr speaker gentle lady I
wanna make sure I understand
sort of the mechanics of how
this section works.
So the way I understand it is
the resident within the previous
six months does one of the
laundry list of things that are
listed in there there's a number
of them
beginning in subparagraph a on
page thirteen and there's a
number of but let's let's assume
that the resident does one of
those things that's listed
Mexican point say the fair
housing.
more Bates ran something like
that.
And then the trigger is than the
owner brings or threatens a
lawsuit for decreases services
increases rant refuses to renew
the rental agreement something
like that and if that happens in
the way I understand the section
is that that is essentially a
per se retaliation is that
correct.
Mr speaker.
Mr speaker German all this does
is just set up an order of proof
Mr speaker gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
seven trying to send mechanics
of how this section works.
It seems like there's there's
two parts this.
One is.
But it makes the complaint under
one of the things that someone
of the laundry list of things
listen debates right print for
example complains about fair
housing.
Then the next is the owner has
to take some kind of action and
that action could be I refuse to
renew the lease agreement or
threaten to sue you by increase
the rent if those two things are
true then that is retaliation as
defined in this section.
Mr speaker gentleman so as
retaliation works in this
section and in other parts of
the law all this would do Mr
speaker and gentleman is allow
for the tenant to present their
case as to why with their action
was retaliatory so go in front
of a judge the judge will say
this was or was not retaliatory
puts that back on to the
landlord to be able to respond
and so proceeds Mr speaker
gentleman.
Mr speaker generated from Santa
Fe I understand later in the
bill gets to sort of that the
burden shifting.
Of you know kind of like a an
accusation affirmative fence and
then
and then the tenant has the
chance to reply and and report
that but I'm just trying to
understand when it defines
retaliation so the resident may
prove retaliation if.
And and that's that's new
language some just trying to
understand tenants.
Mr speaker gentleman the if is
that those elements must be met
in order for a judge to be able
to turn determine the facts of
what of tenant may have
experience Mr speaker gentleman
Mr speaker generated from Santa
Fe and so I guess what I was
outline is what those elements
are outlined those elements
incorrectly.
No Mr chairman that's correct.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe so I want to talk about
some of the the newer laundry
list mind my words on page
fourteen there's a new
subparagraph H. and I realize
this was amended.
With the.
Affirmative number one.
And so I have a question about
this language it's concerning to
me Mr speaker gentle lady.
So as I understand this is that
now if I complained to the
owner.
About the functionality of an
owner supplied appliance.
That is one of those items that
could constitute their set up
the owner for retaliation claim.
Mr speaker gentleman it's not a
set up Mr speaker gentleman if
somebody complains to their of
landlord that they had a
utility.
Go out Mr speaker gentleman and
the.
M. or does not do anything about
that Mr speaker gentleman there
and they decide to pick them at
such a it is a claim for
retaliation.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe so if I make a
complaint that my microwave
isn't working does that meet
this requirement.
Mr speaker gentleman owners
don't supply microwaves in these
in this situation Mr it's not a
utility Mr speaker German.
Mr speaker gentle lady I believe
it says an owner supplied
appliance.
Mr speaker gentleman so if in
your hypothetical if it's in
your lease agreement your renter
agreement and the owner did
supply you a faulty microwave
and you complained about it and
they did nothing about it Mr
speaker gentleman yes it is
their responsibility to have
that fixed.
Mr speaker gentle lady words
that say.
That the owner has to also
failed to do anything about it
within the subparagraph.
Mr speaker gentleman the the
point of this.
Paragraph is the you're right it
doesn't the landlord doesn't
have to respond to that however
if they want to Vic to you
because you complained about the
lack of functionality in that
appliance in that utility and
now they want to remove you from
the premise sees Mr speaker
gentleman this is what is
protecting that landlord from
that retaliation.
Mr speaker that tenant Mr
speaker John.
Mr speaker generated from Santa
Fe but.
It's not just.
Removing the tennis.
Of the language.
Requires only a complaint.
It doesn't say anything about it
being substantiated doesn't say
anything about whether the owner
actually responded to the
complaint.
And then it goes beyond it's
it's refusing to renew the
agreement is one of things that
can constitute retaliation Mr
speaker generated from Santa Fe
is that correct.
That's correct Mr speaker
gentleman a judge would have to.
Assess the complaint that was
made and whether or not it was
factually merited.
Mr speaker generated from Santa
Fe so I have some.
Some serious concerns at all I
have to do is attendance
complain that my Y. where isn't
working.
And now the landlord is stuck in
a situation where.
They have to renew my lease
otherwise they're subject to
retaliation claim.
Is there any requirement that
these type of complaints be made
in writing Mr speaker gentle
lady from Santa Fe.
Can you repeat the question Mr
speaker John Mr speaker gentle
lady from Santa Fe certainly is
there any requirement that the
complaints to be made in
writing.
No Mr speaker gentleman and and
just to be very clear Mr speaker
gentleman if in fact the
microwave fails.
And you complained about it two
of your landlord Mr speaker
gentleman that would still have
to be assessed in a court this
is not this is not about
violation of a lease this is
about.
It is that we're discussing as a
complete if you violate your
leases though as a tenant Mr
speaker gentleman then you are a
lot allowed to be evicted the
judge will want to evict you Mr
speaker gentleman if this was a
complaint and it's substantiated
that the microwave is working
fine and you're simply
complaining about nothing Mr
speaker gentleman then you would
basically be in violation in the
in that sort of way.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe but the problem is.
You make the complaint about the
microwave being faulty now the
language what it says is if your
lease expires and I refuse to
renew your lease.
I am in danger of having
retaliated against you Mr
speaker gentle isn't that
correct.
Mr speaker gentleman that's
correct you have to have a good
reason for not renewing the
lease Mr speaker gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady so is
there a right to renew and
contract.
No Mr speaker gentleman Mr
speaker gently I think that's
that's the point here if I
complain about a microwave but
says a valid complaint.
Now what you're doing to
homeowners as you're making
them.
Have to renew a contract.
And that I think is a serious
constitutional problem the
government can't force a private
party to enter into a contract
when you look at what's on page
thirteen paragraph on a lot of
these things make sense to me.
The owner shouldn't bring or
threaten to bring an action for
possession that makes sense to
me should be threatened a
lawsuit because the tenant
complaints.
Increasing rent that makes sense
to me it shouldn't do that
because the tenant complaints.
But refusing to renew a rental
agreement I think crosses the
line because now what you're
saying is that landlord now must
enter into a new contract he has
no choice and if he doesn't and
there's been a complaint then he
is subject to being found to
have been retaliatory.
And I have a lot of I have a
real hard about that.
And and frankly.
I'm not sure that that that's
even constitutional Mr speaker
gentleman that's just
inconsistent with what we're
doing here Mr speaker generally
can help me then point out what
they can inconsistency is.
Mr speaker gentleman first the
landlord is not forced to renew
that is precisely what you said
it's not contract law it's
that's not in this law that's
not how this is meant to work
what this is meant to be able to
help of what tenant do is if
they do not have a functioning
heater they have no longer have
heat in their house their stove
is no longer working there water
has been shut off to no.
Of no
None of their actions are
basically made that happen
they're asking their landlord to
fix it they should not be barred
from being able to complain that
that that the fact that they
might be losing their home Mr
speaker gentleman this is
project protecting that that
tenants to be able to make that
complaint Mr speaker gentleman
of the.
Landlord does not want them
there they do not have to renew
that lease they can go to court
and have them evicted.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe I've I understand that
that may be what you wanted to
be but we have to deal with the
text in front of us page
thirteen.
Line three a resident may prove
retaliation if.
One of the items is that the
landlord refuses to renew rental
agreement Mister speaker gentle
lady from Santa Fe is that
correct.
Mr speaker gentleman that's
correct.
And Mr speaker gentle lady the
tenant must also prove them one
of the laundry list items
including paragraph H..
Which is a complaint about an
owner supplied appliance not
functioning properly Mr speaker
gentle is that correct Mr
speaker gentleman that's correct
only if they can of an act can
actually prove that.
Mr speaker generally find let's
assume they can prove that at
some point in the last six
months my wife microwave stopped
working.
What I'm suggesting to you is
the way this bill as written.
You are now locking in the owner
to half to renew that contract
if the tenant made a verbal
complaint within the last six
months about an appliance not
working properly Mr speaker
generally one of my missing Mr
speaker gentleman that landlord
can simply take that person to
court and determined that the
retaliatory claim was
unsubstantiated and therefore
they do not have to renew that
contract whatsoever.
Mr speaker generated so again a
four four saying you have to
bring a court action.
Just it will not renew a
contract.
In my opinion.
It would not surprise me if this
specific provision gets
challenging court and get struck
down because I do not believe
that in those scenarios you can
make a private person enter into
a contract I don't believe the
government for constitutionally
do that I think you've got some
serious constitutional problems
with this the last section I
want to talk about his sexual
Levin on page twenty one.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe the the way that I
understand the mechanics of how
this section Levin operates in
this is all new law.
But essentially it's trying to
protect the tenants.
Whose leases expired and we're
in the midst of an either
emergency order situation or
natural disaster.
And it's it's designed to
prevent a landlord from being
able to affect the tenant just
because the lease is expired and
the tenants not able to make
friends is that correct Mr
speaker generated from Santa Fe.
Mr speaker gentleman as is
currently occurring in our more
public global situation today if
we're asking people to shelter
in place under an emergency
order and lease expires and they
have nowhere to go to shelter in
place Mr speaker gentleman this
is just clearly clarifying that
a person can stay in that place
they still have to pay rent they
still have to do all the things
a good tenant would be doing Mr
speaker gentleman this just
means that they cannot force
them out unless of course the
other provisions that state what
would give good reason for a
landlord to need their to take
possession of their household
this allows for those tenants to
be able to shelter in place
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa Fe I'm gonna make a moral
judgment on the tenant but these
the phrase a good tenant paying
rent actually the way the
supplies is for a lease that
expires and you have a ten who's
not paying rent is not correct.
Mr speaker gentleman in
particular for those that have
been experiencing any sort of
hardship during that emergency
order as we have that well
understood in these times of
COVID Mr speaker gentleman this
basically means that they can
shelter in place even if they
cannot make that rent payment at
that time Mr speaker gentle and
we've been able to see how
subsidies other protections and
run we've given away seventy
million dollars to help renters
in these times of COVID in the
state of New Mexico alone to be
able to do that but yes this
helps them basically give that
time to be able to to shelter in
place and make sure that they
have a residency to go home to.
Mr speaker general from Santa Fe
them in the language in the bill
makes reference to the owners
motivation being that the
tenants not paying rent so this
applied to the tenant paying
rent or not paying rent.
Mr speaker gentleman this
doesn't imply that we're trying
to create another year lease or
force anyone to do any sort of
contracting it's a month to
month residency that allows
Montoya to work out with the
landlord what's going on and to
be able to have that
relationship continue on a month
to month basis.
Mr speaker gentle lady I I I'm
not sure maybe I'm not free my
questions correctly I'm not
trying to bait you into a trap.
I'm just trying to understand
the mechanics of the section.
It's my understanding is
assumption is you have a non
paying tenants and I I
understand it may not be his or
her fall I get that but this is
for non paying tenants Mr
speaker gentleman that's
correct.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
Is there anything in this new
new language that would require
the tended to be able to
substantiate that that in fact
they're not able to pay the
rent.
Mr speaker gentleman that's
currently how the supreme court
orders is operating that's
correct Mr German.
Mr speaker gently I'm I'm not
the spring for order we have now
is going to go away at some
point this law is going to
remain so my question is in the
text of the bill is there
anything that requires the
tenant to substantiate that he
or she cannot actually afford
the rent.
When they're not paying the
rent.
Not as a threat Mr speaker
gentleman.
Mr speaker Jim I'm sorry I did
not hear what your spot is also
currently right Mr speaker
gentleman Mr speaker generally
and so I think I think that
highlights part of my concern.
Is there's an automatic
assumption that the tenants not
able to pay and I do understand.
You have a tenant who can't
afford to pay.
This bill covers that but
unfortunately this bill also
covers a scenario for the tenant
is able to pay so if I'm making
a hundred Jeez a year attendant.
I refuse to pay rent in the
middle of an emergency order.
This bill allows me to stay in
that rental units even though I
can afford my rental payment
many times over.
And the landlord has to continue
with me in a month to month
tenancy as long as the orders in
place is that correct.
Mr speaker gentleman.
In all fairness to that
hypothetical it would be
extremely unlikely that a court
would provide that a person had
they been order for eviction for
that reason that they would be
able to stay in that household
any longer I can't imagine a
single court including the
Supreme Court that would allow
that to continue Mr speaker
gentle lady is that what the
text would allow.
Mr speaker gentleman yes.
Mr speaker gentle lady in and I
have concerns because I again I
understand of Carmel if you have
a tenant who can't afford their
monthly rent you know and we've
seen you know lots of small
businesses were closed people
lost their jobs to make sense to
me but the reality is that the
the middle and upper class in
New Mexico actually did very
well during the pandemic and
many of those folks actually
made more than twenty twenty and
twenty twenty one
and so to have a broad brush
strokes to cover all scenarios
for a tenant gets a free pass.
I would like to think that that
the heart of man is is good but
unfortunately I'm not convinced
that it is so I have some
concerns about this the other
thing in New I know that you and
I discussed this offline for.
And I'm not going to introduce
in a minute because I've already
taken a way too much time but Mr
speaker gentle lady.
The other point I think the body
needs to be aware of.
Is we tend to think of of
landlords is as wealthy people.
As very rich people as these
corporations analyses.
Mr speaker gentle lady actually
seventy percent of all rentals
are owned by moms and pops.
Out of those rentals fifty
percent of them have a mortgage
attached to them.
And the way Mr speaker gentle
lady that works in real life is.
You have a mortgage payments due
every month and oftentimes those
mom and pop stated they rely on.
That revenue coming in from that
monthly rental and so my my
concern is.
What happens when the bank
decides they're going to
forclose on that rental property
for non payment of rent our our
non paying the mortgage because
they've been relying on that
monthly rental payments and all
the sudden it's gone and now
this provision provides that you
cannot get that sent out of the
home I have some concerns about
that I'd love the opportunity to
respond to that.
Mr speaker gentle and we've
learned a lot in this
emergency situation that we're
in firstly when it came to
stimulus checks that were
provided to the American people
they use that money for rent and
for food for for housing payment
Mr speaker gentle in the vast
majority in the state of New
Mexico when it came to
Representative help New Mexico
dot org which was helping
renters pay their rents eighty
five percent of those folks took
that rental payment and
immediately applied at the
actually had problems because so
many people paid their rent
first Mr speaker gentleman that
that program needed to be more
flexible to help them pay for
utilities etcetera when it comes
to how people pay an out of
pocket for for the things that
they need to cover their house
their housing payment the rental
payment and their mortgage
payments are always first and
that is no different for these
renters Mr speaker gentleman so
when it comes to how people
protect what they have they
start with their home they make
those payments first Mr speaker
gentleman and then they moved
down the line and make
sacrifices with medicine with
food with payments for their
children at such a they start
with making sure that they have
a stable home the data shows
that front help New Mexico has
proven that with the subsidies
that they've provided and again
for those that are an immense
amount of hardship when it comes
to for those that are struggling
to to make their rent do and
their utilities do we know that
they cover that rental that home
payment first.
Mr speaker gentle lady and.
Unfortunately argument depends
upon the good will of of mankind
and again I'm not convinced that
that's always the case.
I do I do have I guess.
Sort of one last question and
thought is.
We look at all the changes that
we discussed today all the
changes in the bill.
In your opinion does this create
more risk for landlords to stay
landlords.
No Mr speaker gentleman just the
opposite in fact Mr speaker
gentleman many landlords take a
lot of time energy and effort to
find the right tenant and the
costs associated with having to
turn over tenant and find
another tenant Mr speaker
gentleman costs a lot more than
the leaving someone in place
that they trusted that they've
built a relationship with and
that they are expecting to have
a have that trust relationship
and contract to obligations with
one another Mr speaker gentleman
the facts show that the cost of
of having to evict a tenant and
for it for exactly what we're
talking about today Mr speaker
gentleman is is way more than
what we're asking of landlords
to comply with in this law.
Mr speaker generated from Santa
Fe essentially what you just
said is the screenings actually
unit tougher on tenants so your
tenants with bad credit your
tenants with poor rental
histories with addiction
histories are gonna have a lot
harder time finding a rental
unit now because the land there
is gonna be a lot stricter on
the screening and I would submit
the idea that it takes longer to
get in on paying tenant out of
home.
The idea that if I failed to
send a thirty day notice letter
and I don't do in bad faith I
just.
Should have known but I don't
Senate and now looking at twice
of what's owed that I'm facing
that risk.
The risks that if my ten Mexican
point about appliance and non
forced to renew a lease
agreement.
That's an additional risk the
risk of an emergency order.
I may not be able to make my
mortgage payment that's an
additional risk.
So to me want to look at this
bill I understand the intent is
to try to protect the tenants in
New Mexico.
But unfortunately it does quite
the opposite if it increases the
risk on landlord substantially
and wanted to things going to
happen if I'm a landlord on
assessing this I'm either going
to increase the rental payment
that's bad for tenants
affirmative sell my rental
property which drives down the
availability rental units that's
bad for tenants I don't think
this is a good bill for New
Mexico I think it's going to
make a lot harder on the very
people were seeking to protect.
And again I understand intent
but I think it achieves quite
the opposite.
And I would say.
It's one thing for private
individuals to assume the risk
but I think it's another when
the government makes and assume
that risk and for those reasons
I stand opposition thank you Mr
speaker.
No further debate on just
kidding just kidding it's my
last session so the there is
further debate the gentleman
from Travis Lincoln
Representative Nibert.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Now that we've been here for six
hours maybe we need to add a few
more I guess but.
Mr speaker the gentle lady from
Santa Fe yield I yield to my
friends from all those counties
Mr speaker thank you Mr speaker
thank you gentle lady
Also as I stated earlier thank
you for bringing the the
amendment
We still Mr speaker gentle lady
have some significant concerns
as were detail by the
representative from San Juan and
I'm not going to go through the
bill like that in fact the I
would prefer just to cut to the
chase
Mr speaker and gentle lady
are you instead of asking a lot
of questions that have already
been asked if I would just
simply move Mr speaker that we
adopt House for substitute for
house bill sixty five and that
two oh two number of which I
believe has already been passed
out is point two two two five
zero eight point one.
Gentleman if you were just
wanted to invest but we want to
make sure it's on the web.
Is now on the where the
gentleman to explain the house
floor substitute.
Thank you Mr speaker I think
when you look at this house
floor substitute many of the.
Key provisions that the
representative from Santa Fe the
gentle lady has gone over
are are actually incorporated or
continue to be incorporated
within this for substitute for
two or three areas where we
I have tried to address some
focus our our attention I I can
summarizes the retaliation
provisions some of the
constitutional provisions that
were raised by the gentleman
from San Juan County and then
the there may be a couple tweaks
to some some time periods but
let me go through the house
floor substitute my will by page
and and alignments point each
towards the beginning on page
two line twenty five.
Of.
That provision is exactly like
the amendment that was a past
earlier takes us back to the
original language
With the.
I believe it's the same as what
it reads now the.
Page three lines twenty five.
In rate four lines one through
four.
That talks about the invoices to
the residents and I believe that
that is exactly the same page
five lines sixteen.
Of.
Well actually of above nine and
ten is the same as well as
sixteen and I believe that lines
thirteen to twenty five on that
page and line one on page six
for life was the same.
Page six line seven.
We did take out
language after the word deposit.
In the original bill so this is
where some of the changes are
between the substitute bill on a
moving and the bill The that was
before us from the.
Gentlelady from Santa Fe.
Again on page six lines.
We want fifteen.
The lead some language in the
original bill brought by the
Representative from Santa Fe
and it keeps the current law.
The bad faith language that were
discussed or debated earlier.
It's left and from the
existing statute it retains that
language.
This for substitute does.
It doesn't double the amount of
but it does provide for a five
hundred dollar
penalty amount which is double
what the current statutes
provide so we we've doubled the
current statutes.
And we do have
not done the.
Two times is the amount of
there's some.
I think all the things on page
seven are exactly the same.
A. J..
Line nine.
It leaves and
The original law and does not
make the change that was
suggested in the bill by the
gentle lady from Santa Fe.
the line twelve we do take it to
the eleven day notice which is
the same as appears in the
journal ladies from Santa fe's
Bill.
lines twenty.
Twenty one through twenty five
the the difference between this
full house for substitute and
the building was before us is
the bill had twenty one days and
this has fourteen days so we've
we've increased it from three
days to fourteen days the gentle
lady from Santa Fe have twenty
one days.
Nine lines one through six I
believe those are the same the
changes that appear in the
gentle ladies
from Santa fe's Bill.
page JM.
Just some clarify fine language
the to I believe is the same in
this house for substitute has is
in of the.
Gentle lady from Santa Fe this
bill I was on page eleven those
few changes in language are the
same as in the.
gentlelady from Santa fe's Bill
Page twelve.
The line one I believe that's
the same as in the gentle lady
from Santa fe's bill but
beginning at that line state I
believe line a.
we did take out language here
this is a retaliation section
that was discussed at length
earlier and we have basically
restored the existing language
in the statute and have
Of.
Taking out some of the language
of the appears in the in the
original bill that was before us
seventeen the changes to get
aligned seventeen through.
Twenty four I believe are the
same as in the gentle lady from
Santa Fe is bill if page
thirteen
up in line to that's the same as
in the gentle lady from Santa
fe's bill you'll notice on page
thirteen line.
Well between the lines.
Ten and eleven we did take out
of the program fates of the was
amended.
Them that talks about the
complaints to the gas company
and at and on the dealing with
with other things or originally
compliance of the gas company it
was amended to deal with the
complaints to the owner about
the functioning or safety of a
mechanical device Senator
that was that's not in this bill
we did not have that language
earlier if.
Paragraph eight on page thirteen
there are lines eleven through
sixteen it is the same as in the
gentle lady from Santa fe's bill
as are the minor changes for the
reason.
For us to that page.

After line for.
Miss Vigil for substitute takes

from Santa Fe is bill.
The remaining change in line to

same as in the gentle lady from
Santa fe's Bill Page fifteen.
winds.
Basically all the little changes
from line six through
Sixteen of the same as in the
gentle lady from Santa fe's bill
but down.
Online.
Twenty one and twenty two home
page fifteen if I believe the
gentle lady from Santa Fe have
from fourteen to twenty one days
the agency restores at of seven
not more than or not less than
seven days for more than
fourteen days after the service
of the summons little bit of
change their.
Age sixteen all those changes I
believe are the same as the
gentle lady from Santa Fe this
bill could seventeen the changes
at the top of the page and
sections lines one through
fourteen of the same.
But we in this house for
substitute we deleted section I
C. of
section nine of the bill from
the gentle lady from Santa Fe.
Of the remaining changes lines
eighteen through twenty four
that is the same as a gentle
lady from Santa Fe as bill as is
all the changes on page
eighteen.
Of the last page page nineteen.
Subsection serial lines eight
through eleven are the same as a
gentle lady from Santa Fe.
And then
At the end after line eighteen
we did the we sectional Levin
the appears and the gentle lady
from Santa fe's bill and the do
we sit here and the rand or for
those changes are largely
To.
Somewhat restore maybe a more
level playing field between the
landlord and tenant if it does
recognize extended time periods
of we did try to take out some
provisions that we believe will
be challenged constitutionally
the
dealing with maybe forcing
people into a contract that was
discussed by the gentleman from
San Juan and so with those
Changes Mr speaker I would move
this house floor substitute and
I would like to roll call vote
are you on a roll call vote is
this a friendly for substitute
Mr speaker.
I will go back to the gentleman
from Chavis and Lincoln is there
debate on the floor subject.
Yes Representative Strickler you
have the floor thank you Mr
speaker and and and with the
gentleman from
the ship was can we please you.
Mr speaker certainly yield to
the gentleman from San Juan
thank you thank you Mr speaker
thank you gentleman
your amended bill or your
subsidy bill does it take care
of the constitutional alti
Issues of the of a the regular
bill in terms of of interfering
with the contract.
Mr speaker and gentleman to the
best of our ability we omitted
the provisions that we felt
could be challenged
constitutionally and or maybe of
those provisions from the bill
yes or so Mr speaker and
gentleman if if I have a lease
contract I'm the landlord and I
have a year lease with a tenant
and that's
the standard you know lease
agreement that the
the New Mexico realtors put out
in and it's a
it's agreed to by both parties
you know the all the details of
the rants the deposits late fees
and all those sorts of things
This will protect that contract
relationship because there was a
mutual agreement to sign that
ladies.
Mr speaker and gentleman our
intention was to.
Pre vet challenges for forcing
one into a contractual
relationship the very
maybe did not want to enter into
and to take out the some of the
what I'd consider taking these
government takings provisions of
that force used to.
Use your property in a certain
manner would which would be the
provisions they're at the in
that the representative of the
the other representative from
San Juan alluded to earlier so
much for should Mr speaker and
and gentleman we don't want to
we don't want the government to
rewrite the contract
Mr speaker and gentleman that
that was a primary concern them
that we think that people have
freedom to enter into contracts
and it's not government's
position to rewrite those
contracts for them.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
that there was a concern of mine
that killers a lot of a.
Good landowners tenant
relationships and no no
sometimes or some adverse
affection and emotional and
words that I know you know
trying to work those issues out
of all entirely and of the
spirit of cooperation and and
but the lease agreement is there
for a reason
that landlord Mr speaker and
gentleman
investors you know a lot of
dollars in in purchasing the the
rental property and defacing it
up and making sure it's
in first class and one of want
to make sure that that both the
landlord and the tenant or taken
care of so the like yourselves
to bill that it does.
Reaffirm
you know contractual issue
between the parties and that's
you know that is protected by
the constitution and I don't
think the state wants to get
involved in in re running those
contracts so thank you for
presenting this bill and thank
you Mr speaker.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman.
There's further debate
Representative the
representative from curry
Representative Crowder thank you
Mr speaker of the gentleman
please you.
Mr speaker is certainly yield to
the gentleman from curry.
Thank you gentleman
I have built a lot of apartments
in my history over the years
I've owned a lot of apartments
Solos apartments because it
became more and more difficult
to collect rent and and make a
profit and then
It it just became something that
I found a better way to make a
living so.
But I I notices we went through
the other bill
as I read through that I was
discouraged.
From the thought of wanting to
build some more apartments or do
something because of someone
else being able to control what
I could and could not do with my
own apartments that I put my
money into.
So don't as straight question is
this bill going to encourage
more development in the
apartment arena or is it going
to discourage.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
a that's a tough issue because I
do believe the.
When we.
In time periods when we.
Chair of more difficult for a
landowner to.
recover possession of that
rental units.
That that.
Discourages people from like you
stated investing them or
building or getting into that
type of business.
We have extended time periods in
this for substitutes no doubt.
We've we've extended those time
periods so to the extent that
those discourage people we have
but what we've tried to do with
the floor substitute is maybe
make it a little more level
playing field but it still
would be discouraging I think to
any landlord
you know looking at this because
time periods are extended they
don't get that the media it's a.
They don't have immediate
records for non payment of rent
can you have to go through this
process of baby is four under
somewhat a lot of landlords
would like to see.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman I I guess that's
that's what I'm really
struggling with on both of these
bills it is I know you're trying
to look out for the tenth I
understand that I know that we
have a pandemic and there's
issues
I understand that.
Of our experience in my
community as all of our good
builders are going to Texas but
because they don't have these
kind of laws so John I I I don't
know how to dig deeper knowledge
is on this is what you're doing
tonight comparable with what the
laws and taxes are six miles
from my house.
Mr speaker and gentleman I can
barely get more of my arms
around all those books in front
of let alone all the books in
taxes so I would have I would
not have any idea.
Okay I appreciate the honesty
that the the.
You're you're New Mexico
attorney and I appreciate that I
I do know that I've lost a lot
of constituents.
To the to the east and and I'm
concerned that this.
Both of these.
Here's to a lesser extent.
Are going to continue to.
Tighten the housing market.
Because of the owners and some
of the regulations and things
are going on with them I think
we're going to see more more
issues
I hate that the the the the.
In order to protect the tenet
maybe that's what we have to do
I don't know the.
Both of these bills trouble many
years not nearly as much as the
other but I appreciate your
frankness and honesty thank you
Mr speaker.
just before we go to the floor
we do have the representative
from Bernalillo Sandoval in
Santa Fe Representative Lord
hand is up and I'm not sure if
that's on the bill or on the
floor substitute.

and that is for the bill thank

Hello to table Representative
also votes now.
The vote is now closed by a vote
of forty three in the
affirmative twenty two in the
negative house for substitute
for house bill sixty five has
been tabled gentleman from
Chavis and Lincoln you still of
the floor thank you Mr speaker
You know this is one bill that
that I heard a lot of COVID for
my community particularly from
small retirees who all wanted to
I residential units that they
lease out and I think what the
representative from San Juan
said needs to resonate with this
body because I think there will
be an effort.
or there will be a cooling of
the desire for people to get
involved with rental properties
and those that are involved will
likely raise their prices for
rental terms due to the risk
that they will the additional
risk so I undertake by virtue of
this legislation should give the
passed into law them for those
reasons I to join with my
colleagues from San Juan
speaking against and and
encouraging this body not to
vote for this legislation thank
you Mr speaker thank you gentle
lady appreciate your patience
with me not only in committee
but here tonight.
There is further debate on the
bill the gentle lady now from
Bernalillo Sandoval in Santa Fe
Representative Lord.
Thank you Mr speaker and I can't
see where you are from some
colleges will be represented
cease yield.
Representative
I will yield to the gentle lady
I'm from Santa Fe thank you it
is very very late okay so Mr
chair representative so I think
part of my concern on this bill.
Is and I took time to build this
before when we were in the
committee is I actually am the
hypothetical situation that my
representative on our site
talked about before I did in
here house and my parents and
passed away and I didn't have to
make a mortgage payment and I
did have somebody step three now
once and not twice and Michael
goes back to not everybody is
altruistic and want to do the
right thing my first sentence he
just decided he was going to Hey
I think I found out later who's
gonna buy a house you just quit
paying the rent my next ten it
ended up being a disaster that
law enforcement ended up coming
house numerous times.
The moral to the story is I'm
just being as of previous
representatives said and I and I
will increases any
Sophisticated landlord in the
past.
Yes.
Thank.
This question here.
I feel like it's going to put
people like me and other people
that I know that have been
shared houses from their parents
or grandparents in the past way
in a bad position when they have
a mortgage to pay so the first
question I have and I don't have
money and stayed very late but
I'm.
So.
To show our I know there is
there's an emergency situation
on but did they have to show any
proof.
The got COVID they got laid off
the campaign or is it just.
We have this emergency
declaration and that's it do
they have to show me any kind of
proof that they can't pay Mr
chair and representative.
Mr speaker gentle lady are you
referring to the sectional of
another our bill just so I'm
clear where you're where you're
concerns are lying.
Thank you Mr chair and
representative my concern yeah
it's they can't pay the rent
they're not paying the rent and
I'm like okay.
I'm gonna give you three notice
do they have to come to me and
say Hey you know what look at
here and lost my job you can
call my boss here's my positive
comment any is there anything
that they have to show to show
to me that I can.
At least wrap my head around why
this person is not paying the
rent or lay on the rest Mr.
You Mr speaker gentle lady so if
you were Representative your
renter misses one issues with
sheer he's one day late on that
rental payment you can go ahead
and issue an eviction notice Mr
speaker gentle lady.
Okay so in other words I don't
have to Shani group is that
correct Mr speaker and
representative.
Mr speaker gentle lady so if you
have unpaid rent that you are
due as a landlord Mr speaker
gentle lady you go through the
process you issue your notice
and that can the process
commences Mr speaker gentle.
Okay yes speaker gentle lady so
I have the same concerns
the other people mention.
I really think this is going to
end up in court I don't think we
can force December contracts and
look into working right here for
committee and owner for more
reason to renew.
Seated terminate during this
emergency disaster
And again it goes back to the
same situation I had in my Mr
record because I was single at
the time I'm here to this house
and I was making the payments on
it and then when my tennis the
second tenants when they decided
they were going to need racks
they also didn't get utilities
and right here in New Mexico
Environment step of unpaid
utilities then I am the house
the place broken house so is
there anything currently New
Mexico and and please excuse me
is I know still a lawyer talk
and now you're getting
sophisticated explained March
but is there anything in our
state or federally that says
okay if we passes and this
happens we're going to help the
mom and pop landlords out to
paid the mortgage or rate party
to let these things like that in
place right now
Mr speaker and representative.
Yes Mr speaker gentle lady
so currently if there's any
issue with you know worry about
making a mortgage payment for
help homeowners the FHA and the
VA have forbearances and loan
modifications available for
landlords currently both Fannie
and Freddie have modifications
available unfortunately not for
forbearances and that way and
USDA does not have either
available for landlords that we
know of at the federal level Mr
speaker gentle lady currently to
if there's any issue with
nonpayment there's a much longer
time frame for anyone that has a
mortgage that they need to be
paid it can be anywhere from
four months to two years where
they can be behind on rent fund
mortgage payments and still be
able to keep their homes Mr
speaker gentle lady were as when
it comes to land to tenants who
would much rather actually own
their home than rent based on
our data fund there's just there
to just can't afford to do so
unfortunately Mr speaker gentle
lady the one day that they miss
their rent payments they can
already get it the fiction
notice issued to them.
Thank you Mister speaker chair
yeah wasn't that case when I
went to my bank I was talking to
dance with the loan I had it was
pretty much for just gonna
foreclose unless you figure out
if there were no options
so my other question is I have
on G. H. what is.
Nine
Winds five so I went through and
I just skimmed over other states
to have a three day notice and
Was Mr speaker chair there are
eighteen the the dominance of
states California Florida
Arkansas Idaho Iowa Kansas
Louisiana Mississippi Montana
New Mexico North Dakota Ohio
Oregon each so the COVID Texas
Utah West Virginia and Wyoming
and especially I want to point
out Texas and so many people are
bailing out of here sadly and I
wanted to stay
There's eighteen of those the
majority or three days I was in
looking up Mr speaker and
representatives look at other
days and and we have those too
you like eight or seven days I.
three or ten days and then a few
outliers unlike New York Vermont
center fourteen so I'm Mr
speaker Representative where did
you come up with eleven days on
Wall compared all the others Mr
speaker gentle lady thank you
for that question and the first
draft of these bills that was a
negotiation with landlords and
their representatives around the
state we would have liked to
extend this of quite a bit
longer to be fair to to what it
is that we see is a crisis in
New Mexico this was a back and
forth dialogue with with
landlords around the state who
agreed that eleven days is
sufficient time for them to be
able to to have that time line
to talk to their lives to their
tenants tend to try to receive
that rent payment back so at
this was what we decided after.
Many many hours of deliberation
back and forth this is the
agreement that we made.
Thank you Mr speaker and
representative yeah I was I was
one of the because of the
dominance of the states are
three days a New Mexico is going
to be the second longest time
period in the nation and I just
thought that was very excessive
I'm so close with this having
been an unsophisticated previous
landlord and almost losing my
house almost getting bad credit
because I had two people backed
back that would pay their rents
didn't even frozen time crises
of this person that region where
the house thank you and
Stephanie for money for months
on end yes you can go to court
and guess what happens when
somebody owns a business and
it's a cash business
construction those claim they
don't have the money you have
excellent time to collect it
from your not gonna collected or
the end up with somebody was
going to jail you're not going
electors for from them sh so
huge problems with this with
this force contract extending
the days I feel like this is to
be way too heavily towards the
mom and pops peopling Committee
we're just trying to make ends
meet trying to pay this mortgage
when this house which is kind of
you know ended up in their lap
after losing parents so delay
were built using them with
distilled there's no way I can
get on board with this we could
onboard maybe to substitute that
even that I like things to be
balanced and fair and to me Mr
speaker and Representative this
I think it's going to really
harm our state I'm trying to
keep people from moving out of
here and there are tons of
people are hemorrhaging out of
the state and now I just see
what here's another reason why
people are gonna go move to
Texas because.
They don't have to this kind of
stuff they don't have to jump
through all these hoops they
don't have to be forced into a
contract so I think I understand
your attention but the problem
is I think we're we're going
about this this is going to have
more people leaving our state I
can see rents going up and see
deposits going out going to see
people selling their properties
because they don't want to be
landlords anymore and probably
in the state so Mr speaker and
Representative that's all the
questions I have a of my time
thank you there is further
debate the gentle lady from
Valencia Representative Fargo.
Thank you Mr speaker whether
kind lady please.
Yes I will yield my time to the
gentle lady from Valencia thank
you so much so I just have a few
questions.
as you know I am not an
attorney.
I do to real estate though.
So I'm trying to understand a
few things in your piece of
legislation Mr speaker hi lady.
Would you mind going to page
thirteen.
Line for.
And we're doing the reading page
line four to seven for me
please.
Mr speaker gentle lady I'm also
not an attorney the page four
line of page thirteen lines four
through seven states that after
a resident may prove retaliation
if an owner brings or threatens
to bring an action for
possession decreases services
increases rent refuses to renew
a rental agreement or serve the
notice of termination under
section forty seven dash eight
dash thirty seven
and so forth.
Thank you and would you mind
going to page twenty two.
Line three.
And would you mind reading page
twenty two line three to five.
Mr speaker gentle lady this is
current law page twenty two
lines three through five states
that in order owner shall not
refuse to renew or seek to turn.
I apologize this is our new
section I apologize and thank
you for gentle lady three
through five states The New
owners will not refuse to renew
or seek to terminate any rental
agreement that expires during or
for thirty days after the
termination of or declaration of
emergency or disaster so Mister
speaker kind lady like I said
I'm not an attorney but in your
previous testimony he basically
said as a landlord myself I
would not be required to have to
renew a rental agreement.
You have to places in your bill.
That we require me to renew a
rental agreement.
Mr speaker gentle lady in the
first portion of the bill that
we were reading this has to deal
with retaliation so you can you
cannot as a landlord refused to
renew as a retaliatory action
against your leg attendance Mr
speaker gentle lady.
So and the second the second
section explained that.
Mr speaker gentle lady the
second portion during a time of
emergency or natural disaster
just requires the the tendency
becomes a month to month
residency in section be during
that time of emergency.
I'm thank you Mr but that's what
it says.
Refused to renew.
To terminate any rental
agreement in the previous
section this time it talks about
C. to renew a rental agreement
Mister speaker kind maybe you're
forcing me to renew a rental
agreement when your previous
testimony said I would not be
forced to do that.
Mr speaker gentle lady in the
emergency order.
Situation that you're describing
Mr speaker gentle lady it just
merely goes to a month to month
read presidency finds three
through five continue to help
them understand what it is that
we're asking landlords to comply
with.
Mr speaker kindly that's not
what it reads shall not refuse
to renew or seek to terminate
any rental agreement it doesn't
talk about going to month to
month.
Mr speaker gentle lady if you go
down to the section be.
that is about that renewal
period it talks about it talks
about the month to month
residency.
I'm going back to.
The previous page thirteen.
You're busy forcing me to renew
a rental agreement with that
range of Freeman has expired.
Mr speaker gentle lady that's
that's not correct this is
actually just refusing to
Have to renew based on our
retaliatory action.
Explain that I'm Mr speaker
highlighting.
Mr speaker gentle lady you
cannot refuse to renew a lease
based on a protected activities
so if it's that someone is being
retaliated against for the
reasons listed in the bill for
violation of the human rights
act etcetera that's the only
reason you cannot renew Mr
speaker comedy can you go to
page fourteen.
Would you mind reading wind
eleven to thirteen for me
please.
Mr speaker gentle lady the new
section we've added section H.
letter age talks about
complaining to a gas actually no
let me read from the amended
bill.
Section ages complained to the
owner about the functioning
receive a mechanical device our
service of a gas electric or
water utility for New owners
applied appliance for.
So Mister Mister speaker kind
lady is it is it does require me
to replace that owner applied
undersupplied plants.
Mr speaker gentle lady no it
doesn't require that you do that
this nearly discusses what is
not an action to be able to be
retaliated against a a lot
attendant for.
Mr speaker highlights.
It.
I'm trying to understand this
bill I really am.
Why would you put something in
there if I I don't know who
tells me the stove is broken.
And.
What
you're right a real life
situation explain to me how I
can retaliate I owner talent by
tenet telling me the stove is
broken Mr speaker gentle lady so
in context of the entire
landlord tenant law this is
merely discussing a retaliatory
action for reason that.
A land of the landlord cannot
retaliate against a tenant in
current law Mr speaker gentle
lady landlords have certain
obligations for functioning
utilities outside of this
portion of the law that we're
discussing now.
And this is.
Right I mean so where's the
protection for the the landlord
we are also dealing with the
crisis we're dealing with the
supply crisis right now where
you can get refrigerators you
can't get washer and dryers you
can't get microwaves so where's
the protection for the landlord
because I'm going to be accused
of retaliation but I also have a
supply of supply chain issue I
have several properties it takes
me weeks to get people to go out
and work on properties where is
my protection Mr speaker
highlighting.
Mr speaker gentle lady that's
what you would be able to
explain to a judge in court Mr
speaker gentle lady right now
when we talk about supply line
we have seen an increase in
first time home and says
homelessness due to the housing
crisis because of prices rising
because of the lack of supply
and housing etcetera so what
we're trying to do is ensure
that those who should be able to
stay in their homes for all the
reasons that we've stated here
we would like them to be able to
provide that opportunity to do
that with their landlord.
Mr speaker you have no
protections in here for the
landlord my only course of
action is to take somebody to
court now as a landlord you are
actually correct in your earlier
statement that we have no desire
to kick anybody out.
We have no desire to to send to
send to evict somebody it is
much harder but you also don't
provide protections for
landlords in these situations
you don't provide protections
for those of us who also have to
deal with the supply chain you
also have to deal with workers
who can we can get people to go
in and fix properties you find
no protections Mr speaker kind
mating
do you know how many of the
homes resident with the rentals
in New Mexico are privately
owned homes.
Mr speaker gentle lady let me
know that seventy percent.
And.
Senator stakeholders stand up in
support of this piece of
legislation who were they.
Mr speaker gentle lady there's a
long list.
I don't have that with me
thank you can go ahead and let
the body know who that is Mr
speaker kind might tell you one
thing.
That you only have thirty
percent of the entire
representation stand up and
supported a bill.
Seventy percent were silence
seventy percent were not heard
you said that you actually had
representation from landlords.
Can you explain that statement
to me because I have no idea
what that means Mr speaker kind
IT.
Mr speaker gentle lady this is
the second time this body has
heard this bill it's been well
debated well understood and well
before the public prior to us
being able to deliberate upon it
today we have heard some of the
reservations that
The group that you're discussing
I have had opposition to the
only amendment we've received as
a possibility is from the
realtors association of the
state Mr speaker gentle lady so
the idea that landlords have not
been consulted on this bill that
they have not come into
agreement as to what it is that
we are like we want to be able
to do here to protect both
landlords and tenants and in
particular so that landlords can
get paid is really what the
primary purpose of this bill is
to increase the amount of time
in which they can receive a
payment from their current
tenants Mr speaker gentle lady
this is been well vetted this is
the second time you're you're
hearing this today and there has
not been a single the proposed
amendment from the group that
you're discussing Mr speaker
gentle lady Mr speaker kind of
the you said in your statement
that landlords and they're
representative who is there
Representative Mr speaker kind
lady.
Mr speaker gentle lady I think
you're referring to the
apartment association of New
Mexico with the with that spans
the largest amount of landlord
tenant relations in the state so
Mister speaker committee so
you're only dealing with thirty
percent of the of the of the
owners in the state.
Mr speaker gentle lady I
understand they make a big and
small landlords not just large
bill apartment buildings but
really of a make up of the
breadth of the different types
of housing we have across the
state Mr speaker that Mr speaker
highlighted Department session
represents the apartment
association.
Again Mr speaker gentle lady the
representation that was provided
to us and negotiated with us
again at length with this
represents landlords of all
different shapes and sizes
across the state so the fact
that you're considering only
large apartment buildings is
just inconsistent with the
representation that discuss this
law needs changes with us
actually it is an inconsistent
because they only represent
thirty percent of the rental
properties in the area so you
didn't reach out to the majority
Mr speaker kind lady can you
page please go to page seventeen
forming.
Line sixteen.
There Mr generating I just read
that line sixteen for me please.
To the extent to civil the court
shall.
Find that word for me I have
never seen that before.
Mr Mr speaker gentle lady are
you talking about practicable
accidental yes Mr speaker kind
lady can you please define
practicable for me Mr speaker
gentle lady what is practical is
a legal term.
Mr speaker gentle lady we
discussed this earlier on
another bill this is the plain
language that's used when we're
discussing any sort of of items
that we may in in this body Mr
speaker gentle lady.
So Mister speaker kind lady so
the point.
If it
if it's within reason if it's.
You know it's it's basically
they don't have to do anything
as much as to what you're saying
here but if the courts if they
have the time of they feel like
it if they have extra staff
which we all know the courts
never do.
They shall also unit you're
taking something that.
Have the time to do they shall
do something I'd like I said Mr
speaker kind of I am not an
attorney.
So can you walk me through how
this works.
Mr speaker gentle lady this is
actually an agreement with our
of course system they would like
to have the opportunity to
provide resources information
their knowledge about the
different availability of
opportunity for their tenants in
particular landlords and
particular to have the
information that they need to go
through the legal system that
they would be able to provide
the information and any possible
resources to help these folks
get through the process the the
courts would like to do that
they've asked that we allow them
the opportunity to do that once
any case gets to court.
Mr speaker kind I I really look
forward to have to seeing how if
that language stays is as it
moves forward and goes on to
some lawyers so much smarter
than me one last question Mr
speaker highlighting in earlier
testimony when you're.
Debating one of my colleagues
you said the eleven day rule was
actually the majority of the
country and Representative Lord
actually mentioned that it was
not this is not information I
have I'm just repeating
testimony that was on this floor
earlier.
can you tell me which ones the
truth.
Mr speaker gentle lady we merely
discuss that our current law is
one of the shortest time lines
in the country we match eight
other states with eviction time
frames that are short as are
shorter than ours the date the
eleven day time period was a
negotiation with the landlords
that we discuss
to be able to extend our
timelines.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
can I I don't have any further
questions but it really bothers
me that as I'm listening to this
testimony I have I am writing
down
What my colleague the time idea
said and it's been inconsistent
throughout this testimony and it
really bothers me that you're
right you're requiring me as a
landlord to renew an agreement
do you know how much rent is
increased since January Mr
speaker kind lady I mean Jenny
of last year.
Mr speaker gentle lady I
understand that rent has jumped
anywhere from eleven and a half
to fourteen percent on average
for renters which is about two
hundred dollars per rental per
renter Mr speaker economic some
areas is thirty percent now Mr
speaker kind lady my colleague
said she doesn't want people to
move to move to Texas I disagree
with her this is not going to
force anybody to move to Texas
this is going to prevent
landlords from investing.
In our state is what's going to
do.
Thank you Mr speaker
highlighting there is further
debate the gentleman from
Bernalillo Cibola McKinley score
of San Juan and let's see a
representative Garcia.
Thank you Mr chair Mr speaker
I'm sorry the gentle lady
Breazeale.
I will gladly yield to my
friends in this guy.
Thank you the committee Gen lady
Mr speaker the gentleman had a
survey landlords on the on the
the next tension time over these
The number of from.
Mr speaker gentleman your I
think you're referring to The
New Mexico landlord association
there from New Mexico.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
imagine they would be from New
Mexico but did you ask for
people to do us and all on board
I would never ask anything about
this.
Mr speaker gentleman when we
presented this bill last year
for the first time we met with
the New Mexico apartment
association the representative.
I believe out hundreds of
landlords the the resources
sixty thousand their website
says sixty thousand rental units
Mr speaker gentleman around the
state so that's who we met with
we negotiated with them their
lobbyists there councils all of
the folks that had input into
this bill to try to tighten it
up make it what it is and slim
it down to be fair Mr speaker
gentleman we had a lot more
provisions that we would have
liked to be able to keep in
there which we think both
protect landlords and tenants
but this is what was negotiated
and agreed to Mr speaker
gentleman with those sixty
thousand of representatives
around the state.
Thank you the gentle lady and Mr
speaker hello sixty thousand how
not sure how much of a
percentage of that is the board
actually rent properties.
Mr speaker and gentleman those
are the landlords.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
know I know the land were but
what percentage.
Of the people you talk to.
Over the whole state of New
Mexico.
I'm gonna know what I'm asking
just figured only is.
They are the percent of the
landlord of the fifty percent of
what what percentage of the.
I don't know Mr speaker
gentleman what you let me know.
The.
Mr speaker gentle lady I'm
asking you you said that.
Every sixty thousand be people
landlords I just need to know
what percentage of a is in the
state of New Mexico I'm not
aware of that Mr speaker
gentleman.
Thank you
in lady Mr speaker choose the
June the timeline from three day
to them and in my correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes
that's for the amount of time
the attendant would be able to
get current on rent.
Thank you all gentle lady Mr
speaker of I just have one
question actually is of.
After you serve a notice you
need to take these people to
registry for and with correct.
Mr speaker gentlemen depending
on the jurisdiction it's either
magistrate or metro court.
Thank you the gentle lady Mr
speaker of oil in my part of the
country it will be magistrates
court.
you know how long it takes to do
border magistrate before from
the time you will give notice to
the point.
Mr speaker gentle and currently
it's between seven to ten days
that have to be settled.
Thank you for that and chair of
in lady Mr speaker and are you
aware that after you go to
magistrates with the case.
yes the person renting from you
they can not appeal that
decision to District Court.
Mr speaker gentleman yes the
that's could be the case but as
I understand and the way that
it's currently occurring it's
very very rarely appealed.
Thank you gentle lady because
of.
A. I. the.
The problems in the flexibility
to the District Court and I
talked to a district judge a
retired district judge during
your of gentle lady Mr speaker
and they here between a thousand
twelve hundred cases a year and
I asked him how long it will
take a year.
feel the second we by the six
months.
Of gentle lady Mr speaker what
right does the landlord have
into five to six months.
Mr speaker gentleman what you're
discussing is as far as the only
data that we have those appeals
of even a year that occur even
in Bernalillo county or about
two hundred so as far as the
time lines go Mr speaker
gentleman it'll be relative to
your situation.
Thank you gentle lady but the.
You still didn't answer my
question Sri.
Find the landlord have appear to
time.
Mr speaker gentleman are you
asking just broadly about what
someone.
Going through the court system
regardless of the landlord
tenant cases just any case how
long it would take.
I'm just talking about the Mr
speaker gentle lady Mr Stewart
the rental of from from your
face you.
Mr speaker gentleman the rights
of the landlord during an appeal
would be the right to receive
grants.
Think virgin lady in Mister
speaker the problem being that
you're in the situation of the
boards because they're not
paying rent.
And gentle lady Mr speaker
representative may mention
earlier for you mentioned that
you had a thirty day window.
Either by text or by writing to
the people to do anything
against them or where does that
goal if you're on the field
process.
Mr speaker John in the thirty
days that you're discussing is
the notice that is required for
the landlord to to give the
tenant if they are to basically
pay any fees are they pay any
penalties or any sort of
itemized list of
You know burdens that they would
have to pay for Mr speaker
gentleman.
The gentle lady Mr speaker but
in the process of appeal do you
still have the same right.
Mr speaker gentleman of the
tenant moves at that proportion
that than the yield doesn't
apply.
Season one second Mr speaker
gentleman.
Mr.
Mr speaker gentleman if a tenant
is still paying rent and it's in
the midst of an appeal they can
basically stayed there until the
appeal is considered Mr speaker
John.
Otherwise Mr speaker John and
they would be evicted for on for
non paying for non payment of
rent.
The gentle lady Mr speaker
though the problem is they're
not being ran in there and
appeal processes and we cannot
allow those them of my correct
was is that a correct
assumption.
Mr speaker gentleman pre
pandemic if you don't pay your
rents you get kicked out that's
how it works.
The gentle lady and Mr speaker
in other words if you're not a
bill processes I can actually
get in the big that that will
change in the correct yes Mr
speaker gentleman that's
correct.
Maybe Mr speaker that's all the
questions I have thank you very
much there's further debate the
gentleman Dona Ana grant and
Sierra Representative access is
not here.
For you soon.
We could very good gentleman
from.
Good thank you Mr speaker with
the kindly please yield I will
yields.
Thank you kind lady Mr speaker
I've been listening to the
debate for the last.
Couple hours against our our
half and
And it's.
It's one of those things that
you know I'm I'm not going to go
page by page with I think that's
been asked of I quite a bit in
the last couple hours three
hours whatever it is and and but
I'm gonna tell you to believe Mr
speaker gentle lady that this is
going to encourage.
Someone to become a Landel
landlord.
Mr speaker gentleman I hope so I
think that what we've been able
to see and what's happening
currently in our
situation across the state
across the country the housing
stock is short the availability
of a rental unit is extremely
scarce and of course we're
seeing that rents are continuing
to rise Mr speaker gentleman
despite any of these laws being
passed Mr speaker gentlemen so
it's very lucrative for anyone
to get in the business of
becoming a landlord should they
be able to comply with the laws
and do it right Mr speaker
gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady thank you
for for saying that you know why
I'm going to disagree with you
on that point because I'm gonna
tell you of.
The reason you're seeing the
supply and demand of the supply
of of rentals go go down is
because our landlords are
actually failing else.
I can tell you Mr speaker gentle
lady that as a former land land.
Landlord myself.
I had a beautiful home that I've
purchased in Los crucis in a
very nice place.
Part of Los crucis and I
purchased it as an investment
and I'm not just speaking for
myself I'm speaking for other
people.
That I've that I know and and
and I only had one and then I
will have number one I just have
the one.
And I purchased a Los crucis Mr
speaker gentle lady and I have
had already tenants owners are
very very nice.
They're my tenants for seven
years.
And I never raise the rent on
the for seven years.
R. for Christmas Mr speaker
gentle lady what I my wife and I
decided to do is although the
house was in excellent shape and
we've kept up with all
maintenance is a beautiful home
but decided to upgrade some
things for Christmas for them
although we have never raise the
rent or anything we went ahead
and sexually model is important
in New all granite hold placed
at and new sinks and and the
fixtures all in the kitchen just
as a as a
thanks.
And Mr speaker gentle lady.
Unfortunately that those those
tenants who are wonderful kind
people never of they would call
me only when they needed
something and I would
immediately respond
We're great and they were
actually the the gentleman was
took a job.
Was transferred actually out of
the country.
And so I the big Janet my my
home and I put it up for branch
this is in twenty twenty one.
And so.
We we rented to a new set of all
of ranchers.
And they were good ranchers or
paying for three or four months
until they had the new course
where they didn't they were
required to pay is similar
things to what you're
expressing.
And what happens is.
It wasn't that they were sick or
anything it was that comment
they just happen to hear that
they did not make any
Representative.
So Mister speaker gentle lady
what is happening to me is I
then it takes time to try to
both even though I had
Property manager still are on
the phone trying to discuss that
are in deal with those things
and this went on for months
months and months.
And so I myself whenever the
least finally and if.
And and it ended.
They moved on and I I don't want
to I don't want to rent anymore.
I went ahead because the market
today you can sell your home
these homes right now there's a
there's also a shortage of homes
Mr speaker gentle lady and so
many landlords but they're doing
is is saying you know what I
don't deal with this anymore I
can simply sell my home.
Get the process walk away.
And so Mister speaker gentle
lady what is that that's what's
actually happening and the
reason that you're seen
these spikes in red basically
the supply and demand the
demands there but supplies not
there there are not enough
rentals and therefore as
lucrative as you may think it is
if you're gonna have to build
report to get a if it's going to
give you a lot more rules and
it's going to of the worst.
It's gonna be more difficult to
be a landlord you know we're I
was a bit landlord adjusted
share my my tenants it's
discourages of people to invest
many of these people Mr chairman
excuse me Mr speaker gentle lady
I have mortgages you as you
stated so brings me to my next
question I I heard you earlier
state Mr speaker gentle lady
that.
And please correct me if I'm
wrong that of any maybe Freddie
Mac these
these programs we you can go
without paying your mortgage and
still the work with you can you
explain that to me please.
Chair Mister speaker gentleman
so we were just describing that
there are many protections for a
currents homeowner so in the
case that you're discussing
possibly there the relief often
options available are available
through the FHA and VA they have
forbearances and loan
modifications available Fannie
and Freddie have modifications
available unfortunately not
forbearances and USDA doesn't
have that available for
landlords.
I agree with you Mr of Mr
speaker gentle lady the problem
is also for residential those
are for your those are.
For owning your own home as a as
your primary residence thank you
ma'am and Freddie Mac do not
a loan out for investment
properties as a commercial loan
and so therefore you are dealing
with a with a different lender
that's a commercial setting
those do not apply were you
aware that not madam speaker
additionally Mr speaker
gentleman are you speaking to
commercial loans and their
protection.
But I'm sure Mr speaker gentle
lady is when you most these
people their investments the
purchase of one of these
properties and you have a
usually have to borrow seventy
percent of thirty percent down
its Marshall and Mr speaker
gentle lady does come of those
come under different
There's different.
regulations for your are we
commercial and so these people
can just keep going back to
Freddie Mac in New.
An inmate for homes you can.
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae for
made for your own personal home
of mortgage not for investment
in in in commercial rentals Mr
speaker gentleman again the FHA
and the VA have forbearance and
forbearances and loan
modifications available for
landlords so specifically these
commercial loans that you're
discussing Fannie and Freddie
also have modifications
available on but not for
variances and again that's
commercial that's that's for
landlords.
Mr speaker gentle lady I haven't
heard of that.
My understanding is just all
commercial lending has to be
done through through your
through banking in those
different avenues so regardless
Mr speaker gentle lady many of
those people have
loans against those those
properties and they also have
obligations not everyone single
one of those are gonna fall
under Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae
all this fund given to that and
I can assure you that some of
these have on with the have
loans with all of community
banks and other banks on
commercial setting and are
afforded the same protections of
your expression.
Mr speaker gentle lady on.
Representative Garcia brought up
another point that I was going
to bring up and that is you know
you're only Avenue to it seems
like is to go to court and that
the four systems are full taking
a long time to get in the Mr
speaker gentle lady and so
therefore it just these are just
discouraging things things that
discourage you in in in the
coming up of property of
landlord and so you know
unfortunately that's why we're
seeing the rising prices and
unfortunately that's why we're
seeing the lack of supply for
people who are renting I don't
believe with this although I
know that you're trying to do
something nice for people it's
not bouncing off.
Therefore I believe that you're
gonna see more shortages of
rentals there
It's just it's just unfortunate
we're in the situation but I I
strongly feel Mr speaker gentle
lady it's we're not going to see
some anyone's running to to
purchase the soft these are
homes I did Mr speaker gentle
lady all I was in in trump
Committee altered from committee
in Los crucis and I asked the
county how much money they had.
To help people with all.
With ranch and asked if they
were helping people's rent.
And that during that.
Committee was was made.
Those with the known that.
They did they had a lot of money
but many people weren't so all.
The fine and then there for all
Mr speaker gentle lady
they were landlords that we're
struggling to make payments
themselves and why is because
there was a lack of supply on
rental so with that Mr speaker
gentle lady are you over time
thank you very much senior
further debate gentle lady to

Yes Representative Trujillo
votes yes what is a close
relative thirty eight in the
affirmative twenty seven and
negative house bill sixty five
as amended has passed the house
without an emergency clause.
Next we'll go on to item eight.
Gentlelady from Bernalillo are
you ready on that item Mr
speaker I'm ready when you get
me to that point.
The record reflect all action
necessary for placing health and
Human Services Committee
substitute for house bill one
thirty five on final passage has
been taken the gentle lady to
explain to the.
Thank you Mr speaker house bill
one thirty five of the committee
substitute for house bill one
thirty five Israeli of Bill that
we've been working on over the
last year especially in the
interim it's been a result of
the input from tribal leaders
tribal a coworkers advocates and
impacted families.
The Indian family protection act
will strengthen answer pass the
requirements of the federal
Indian child welfare act
duration thank you Patricia
mantra she said there's a
someone not need anyone hearing
one of the stars
Please proceed thank you Mr
speaker so as I mentioned this
is been a heavy left by so many
people that have been involved
and they all came together to
craft this bill the Indian
family protection act.
Native families historically and
today have been broken up and
separated this was done first of
federal policies and them
through an app to state
practices the Indian family
protection act will prioritize
native children staying with
their families and within tribal
communities.
D. eight northern public council
has passed a resolution in
support of the house bill one
thirty five in addition to that
the Navajo Nation has provided a
letter of support as well.
And during the Indian day.
Friday I believe that was the
all public council of governors
chairman and his message to this
body stated that this is been an
issue the APC G. has contributed
to and supports band with that
Mr speaker hi Sandra questions.
There is debate the gentleman
from Chavis and Lincoln is
recognized for one question.
One amendment.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
county yield Mister speaker I
yield.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you madam chair.
Our rise to try to do one thing.
Yeah and the one thing that
concerns me is not the children.
From this point four because I
believe that it's a very
laudable goal that any Indian
child.
The raised by.
There's parents or their
grandparents or other tribal
members of with which that child
is associated.
I don't have any.
Problems there what I am
concerned about
Mr speaker gentle lady.
Is children who have already
established a significant law
and with a family.
And.
I know of one family here in
Santa Fe.
Who took a young
the girl into their lives when
the I believe the child was days
old when that child
went to them as a foster family
and I believe that they at this
point may even be the adoptive
family this little girl is at
least part of.
native I believe one of the
pueblos around the Santa Fe
area.
In any event.
This family has has
Raises a little girl and she's
now of is the ways tied to me
and
The it's it's our daughter for
all intents and purposes and and
they are this is a young lady's
parents for all intents and
purposes whether the adoptions
gone through or not.
But those stories of those
parents tale about.
The have the ability to be part
of a process and to be able to
to participate at certain levels
has been discouraging to them
so.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
don't want to extend this debate
out long but but I do want to
look at page one hundred three.
One hundred three line twenty
four.
This is the provision regarding
intervention you too certain
proceedings.
And Mr speaker gentle lady your
bill.
Basically takes out.
The ability of.
These.
Call in currency the the the the
these families who have taken
these children and I and have
developed a relationship with
them I bond if you will.
And it now exempt them from
being able to intervene in
proceedings.
And and so.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
would just simply.
FY is it imperative that.
The people that are raising.
Some of these existing children
why is it imperative that we now
exclude them from the this
intervention process.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentlemen so the point that
you're pointing out on page one
of three is actually part of the
children's code so this is you
know the changes that were made
to the children's code to
enforce the Indian family
protection act however the
Indian family protection act is
meant to be read and harmony
with the children's code.
And the law already includes
important rights for foster
parents in the children's code.
Foster parents must receive
notice about any proceeding
involving the children they're
caring for.
In addition to that foster
parents have the right to both
appear and be heard in court
about any of their concerns
regarding children in their care
so in those instances judges can
ask questions receive testimony
from the foster parents.
The Indian family protection act
does nothing to interfere with
those important rights given to
foster parents.
So Mister speaker and gentle
lady then that begs the question
if that already exist why is it
necessary to provide in line
twenty four page one of three
that specific
Provision.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
As I mentioned before
and fortunately our history has
separated Indian families excuse
me Indian children from their
families from their tribes the
purpose and intent of this is to
look out for those Indian
children so that they can then
be placed with extended family
with people in their communities
so again this is a portion of
the overall children's code and
not part of the Indian family
protection act as well but.
Foster parents rides.
Are not diminished this is not
diminished foster parents rights
it really prioritizes keeping
those children by ensuring
keeping the children with their
families keeping the children
with the tribes by ensuring that
the tribes and those families
have a priority of intervention.
Mr speaker gentle lady does it
quote plied to the abuse and
neglect situations that are
present here.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes it
does.
So Mister speaker and gentle
lady under a court if the.
If the proceedings are of the
nature of an abuse or neglect
situation in the foster parents
want to intervene in that
action.
To.
Reflect their experience with
the child and and maybe the
bonds that have been made you're
saying that this provision would
not prohibit them from
intervening in that case.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
correct.
Mr speaker gentle lady them why
do we need to put this exception
you to the intervention statute
here.
Mr speaker and gentlemen so the.
In the past and currently.
With that provision the foster
parents for taking precedence
over the Indian child's family
as well as the Indian tells
tried.
This particular line on page one
hundred three does not say
anything about president or
anything else it just allows
them the opportunity to appear
before the court you just
testified that that situation
already exists so again I it
seems like a very same.
Redundant or something but if we
have to compete in statute and
this court's says they can't
appear they can intervene in
this statute says a third Indian
child you don't have that right
to intervene are we creating
problems.
Mr speaker and gentleman the
rights of the foster parent that
I relate earlier are not in the
in the family protection act
they're not part of a class
there in the states children's
cold.
So Mister speaker and gentle
lady them than we do need this
provision taken out so that they
would have that right to to
intervene.
Mr speaker and gentle lady were
we not.
Mr speaker and gentleman no.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I I
take exception with the and I do
have a floor amendment prepared
Mr speaker this time I would
move adoption of floor amendment
number one to health house
health and Human Services
Committee substitute for house
bill one thirty five that
particular floor amendment is
should be passed out and it's
point.
Two two two five two nine point
one the amendment has passed out
we for the two oh two number and
we are ready to the gentleman
explain the amendment Mr speaker
we would like to recall the
please we'll see what happens.
Okay.
Mr speaker as I've already
indicated on page one hundred
three.
My amendment just simply takes
out the language that is being
amended in to the
children's code to allow
foster parents who have had a
a longer relationship and and
others to intervene and to
proceedings and has the existing
law currently states
that just takes out what is
being amended by the proposed
legislation.
Is this a friendly amendment Mr
speaker it is not a friendly
amendment.
It is all one word read that
does not mean the Jennifer
Chavis and Lincoln isn't himself
a friendly person.
Mr speaker I think we could
debate about that as well.
By the power vested in me by the
constitution and laws of the
state of New Mexico I declare
Representative Nibert to be a
nice person.
Okay so we heard the
Two two number is been moved it
is not from the amendment is the
debate on the amendment.

Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you for your kind words
Mr speaker and gentle lady I'm
I'm unable to find it real
quickly but when I was reading
this bill earlier in the week.
Could you tell me what the
definition of Indian child is in
this bill.
Mr speaker and gentleman I can.
Mr speaker and gentleman the
definition of an Indian child.
Means.
Indian child or a child from
there is reason to know is an
Indian child under eighteen
years of age who isn't either
married or emancipated.
So Mister speaker and gentle
lady an Indian child is defined
as an Indian child.
To meet certain other criteria
the same circular.
Does not.
Speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker and gentleman it does
appear a little circular.
Which.
We can probably fix.
I know we had a couple of typos
So that might have been one of
the.
So Mister speaker gentle lady
you're telling me I ran with the
wrong amendment.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes.
Mr speaker delighted I have one
one for once a.
Mr speaker gentle lady I I just
bring that to your attention
because I do find that the
definition of Indian child in
this bill is circular it's seven
Indian child is an Indian child
under eighteen years of age
meets other criteria but it
doesn't reflect really what.
That child is and I would assume
that it means that it's
recognized by one of the nations
tribes or pueblos something
along those lines and I did not
find that in the definition of
Mr speaker and gentle lady I did
not have an amendment on that to
my
devise but anyway I point that
out maybe you can fix of the.
As the saying
Head over to the other body
thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle and.
There's further debate the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
Sandoval in Santa Fe.
Thank you Mr speaker.
The representative from
Bernalillo county seal Mr
speaker I yield.
Okay thank you Mr chair
Representative sh seventy
questions is late very detailed
bill.
Just a few things.
Correct.
Extended families are ready time
so priority for placement.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
that's correct.
And
Mr speaker and representative in
this bill is there anything in
here it says that there's a
mandatory written notice that
will go out to the family
members like within thirty sixty
days so they will know right
away.
Mr speaker and gentle lady yes
so once a child is put into the
CYFD system CYFD has twenty four
hours to notify the family and
the tried.
Okay so last question how in
that Mr chairman and
Speaker Representative sh so it
doesn't how do we end up with
children and on the deeply with
the family and then later get
taken back to the Senate family
members.
Mr speaker Representative Mr
speaker and gentle lady that's
actually really good question
this is what the bill intends to
prevent because there have been
instances in the past our CYFD
didn't provide notification to
the tribe until it was time for
the termination of parental
rights to public hearing it in
the court so now it says the
twenty four hours as you asked
previously would be implemented.
Thank you Mr speaker
Representative so thank you want
to read through all the stuff
having production myself.
My main concern is always what's
best for the child and I'm not
saying going back to their roots
is not for that long Madam plan
at all I just I choose to see
stated priority of what is best
for the child and.
For me being adopted going back
to my roots would not have been
definitely the best choice for
me so I'm going to our readers
more stuff in this bill my main
concern is that
Thirty should always be to the
child and then having the best
environment for them to be
nurtured and that's all of
course I have thank you.
Thanks to the gentleman from
Bernalillo Representative
Chasey.

lady to close.
