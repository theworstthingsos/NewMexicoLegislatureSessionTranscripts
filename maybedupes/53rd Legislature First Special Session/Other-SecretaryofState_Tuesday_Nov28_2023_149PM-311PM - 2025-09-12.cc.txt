The present selection process
the public precinct selection
process for the post election
voting machine system check also
known as a post election audit
according to state scatch you
legislation pass just this year
we are now required and are
happy to conduct these post
election system checks after
every general skis me after
every statewide election so this
year's regular local election
that took place in early
november we will be going
through the process of selecting
precincts to add it to make sure
that our ruding machine systems
are tabulators counted those
boots correctly inaccurately I
just have a few opening remarks
and then I will hand it over to
our audit team at a lot nick and
sound about so for those who are
watching and listening in you
can't see me but what you were
seeing is
what
are audit team is going to use
to select or presincts it's a
random selection they will be
using
seven sided day how how many
sides yet of their seven a
possible numbers seven side die
rules to select the precincts
that will be added
so it is completely random
and nobody knows and advance
what those precincts are going
to be
just a few things to mention our
state conducts mandatory
reelection certification of all
hard building systems making
sure there adding and tallying
those votes correctly we use a
hundred percent paper ballots
and every election that allows
us to conduct this type of post
election audit process to ensure
that our machines are tabulating
correctly
and we have multiple post
election processes to make sure
that elections are accurate
including automatic rec.
Which were ordered earlier today
for the regular local election
at the state word of campus
meeting
so once again this is going to
be the process to select
receipts to be randomly audited
to insure
that our tabulators across the
state counted votes correctly
and november
this process statutory involves
an independent auditor
our team again it that's a lot
in a consent of all who will
evaluate the accuracy of our
tabulators those tabulators
again that were used in the
twenty twenty three regular
local election
so with that i'm going to hand
it over to your the article team

normalised to fit within the
range of the ballots cast which
were two hundred and fifty
thousand five hundred and eighty
two for this regular local

hundred and sixty three mexico
presents.
All ballots cast within a
pricing in the state any mexico
will have an equal chance of
being randomly selected for
testing
the three contests with the
closest margin between the two
candidates receiving the
greatest number of votes
affecting the final outcome for
an office from each other
selected presidents will be
recounted.
The accession to this will be
the contest requiring automatic
