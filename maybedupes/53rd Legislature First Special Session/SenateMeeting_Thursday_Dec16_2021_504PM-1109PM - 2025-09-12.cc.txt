Mr president I get it but by
also by that token now on my

talk about certain things that's
how it's been for ten years here
but with respect to my district

I guess I'm confused can the
what is that two of the senator
will yield to a question what is
the exact to a two number of the
bill we're considering this Dale
Mr president yes.
Okay I'm here thank you Mr
president so in that so I just
want to remind the body for
those who don't have the
pleasure of living where I do I
show up here and work as hard as
all of you to represent this
district.
Mr president the C. R. C. in the
maps they presented to this.
For example none of the C. R. C.
maps had my district district
twenty six running south of
central.
The Sanchez Bill however what
along central all the way to the
county line.
Of a budding the freeway that
triangle there that you see in
the map.
Why does this matter deviate
from the C. R. C. map Senator
Lopez with respect to Senator
district twenty six hello this.
Thank you very much Mr president
In the my presentation in front
of the committees and of course
on the floor yesterday evening
if you will notice what is
Albuquerque and has been moved
to next to of the district up in
Rio Rancho because there was an
overflow of population so in
the south valley and moved it
over so in order to cover and
make sure that we had
representation for downtown as
well as parts of the south
valley that you're referring to
senator of this area about this
approach about the deviation of
the State our segment Senator
Lopez Mr president Senator no I
did not and Mr president that
map Senator Lopez Mr president
Senator no I did not approach
either one of the a coalition of
neighborhoods so Mister
Lopez I'm Mr president Senator
there is not much of a deviation
from your previous
boundaries that you had you are
sure that you know there is a
coverage with regards to the
population for representation so
as far as I understand that but
Nibert association group the
website coalition in
neighborhoods the southwest
coalition of neighborhoods and
throughout the entire C. R. C.
and why.
Because that's what made sense
when non partisan eyes looked at
my district.
But unfortunately what has
happened Mr president is without
to carve up my district and
here's how it's done Mr
president.
The community is a long if you
And there's a lot of Democrats
who feel very strongly about
that.
And there's a lot of people just
sort of feel very strongly
against the progressive white

pleasure of attending the

through all of.
Every single C. R. C.
recommendation.
Takes the exact opposite

communities it wasn't added to
me as a senator for the area for
ten years.
So what this map does Mister
president is essentially it puts

should expect.
That is.
that is error against that is
that is the definition.
do so we will tell you where you

who represents you and we and I
will tell you Mr present I watch

just be happy with twenty four
districts.
And stop complaining about it.
Let me tell you Mr president.
it doesn't matter if it's coming
from the democratic side of the
aisle or the Republican side of
the aisle it is oppression.
So much person I just because I
know I'm not going to win this
my mom
my by my integrity matters more
than any name next to my County
And I'm sitting here trying to
figure out but all I know is
this under the original Senate
bill two and under the amendment
Senate bill two.
I would have appreciated Mr
president even if I'm not in the
same party as the major the
courtesy that I thought we used
to extend to each other on this
floor.
carve up your district how do
you feel about that.
So I'm not going to win this
debate I assume the votes are in
Does not make sense and why does
it not make sense the interests
of folks north of central are
fundamentally different than
those south of central along at

But if that was the case I want
the neighborhoods actually
consulted.
Why wasn't this map presented
before the westside coalition of
neighborhoods of the southwest
session with all C. R. C. maps.
Trudy my did my district a
certain way.
That magically once we got into
session and the partisan process
It was changed to crack Hispanic
voting power between north of
central and Paseo del Norte.
The idea that they are just
simply cast aside because
they're not on the winning team
I've heard a lot this session Mr
president a building on the

Let me assure everyone the

And I think speaking as a
Hispanic where mail the efforts

It's not I'm not making it up Mr
president it's as clear as day.
And so I said to this body in
closing.
And these maps may have been the
product of a lot of backroom

It doesn't mean the right.
It doesn't mean they're legal.

say I find these maps

it is not the interest of the

When I said that the Senate's
approach to redistricting this

The most telling thing about.
The letter that I got today from
the league of women voters was

All I come today is with a

Unfortunately Mr president this

Mr president.
Do we not matter.
The people who live next to may
not matter to at least be asked

with is this I ask those of you

New Mexico needs leadership
Mr president which asks me to
betray the people that elected
me that asked me to betray my

Just to vote for a map that part

So one or two senators get to
divide up my district on the
I've been listening and all been

But I was making a living.
I listen to a lot of these
hearings.
a not for representation for me.
I'm tired of being told by a
eight what I in my community
should be thankful for.
You've gotten enough minority
I won't be on a team that seeks
to silence the people that
raised me and I represent.
that cost me everything in this
room and all of your respect
that is an easy price to pay
because I know when I look in
the mirror Mr president.
I like what I see.
Is not to achieve priority for
myself or for any of my friends
but to do this stupid thing.
What is being done.
To the Hispanic communities
north of central in this bill.
Is cracking.
That's that's when I look at
this map in the division between
twelve twenty three twenty six
ten eleven and fourteen.
That's what I see.
tonight.
Yeah I've been in this chamber a
long time.
I came here for the first time
when I was twelve.
I'm gonna tell you start never
told anybody else but I think it
hopes I just hope it gives you a
sense of who I am as a person
you may hate me may have turned
out already.
You can make a commitment to
someone shake their hand and two
seconds later break it.
That's not the sun I came to.
About my own integrity.
Many years ago my grandmother.
Was prosecuted and convicted.
John Kelly U. S. attorney at the
time.
In a plea deal agreement with my
grandmother said if you flip.
To lie had told her to register
that person at her home she
would face immunity she would be
prosecuted.
Whatever you want to say about
many.
The things he did on this floor
for people.
That's unassailable.
You may have made some mistakes.
grandmother did the right thing
and told the truth and what
happened she was prosecuted by
John Kelly a democratic U. S.
attorney she was convicted of a
integrity what I say you're my
friend what I said I make a
promise to you that's my
measure.
I don't see that integrity lived
out in this process.
put personal partisan interests
aside.
I'm not just sounds crazy at
this point.
How did we get to that place.
In this country.
I'll tell you Mr present that
the collateral damage of that
I respect everybody in this room
well mostly I respect the
majority of people in this room.
I respect their votes and so you
know you all do what you want to
the Democratic Party or the
popular people within the
Democratic Party.
But my job is to actually follow

It is that oath Mr president
that respectfully.
my little corner of the world.
Of many people who society would
otherwise just wish to forget.
What you do not is not fair.
And so you can win votes but as
I was told by Senator marker
Sanchez years ago just because
you can doesn't mean you should.

omitted from this map.
Predominately Hispanic

And I'm sorry I disagree.
I see what that looks like an

People of color we are just told
to do what you always are told
to do.

process.
Of being consulted.
What is it about my district the
Hispanic working class folks
That is not defensible to me
morally.
Any rationalization can be given
on the floor that's fine.
have thought naively not easily.
After ten years of being you're
calling I would have at least
warranted a phone call from the
sponsor us how I felt about
This is why our body has a
reputation it does outside of
these walls.
I will sit here and do my duty.
And all I can say Mr president
is after having been kicked out
of my office move to a different
place on the floor.
Because nothing any of you can
offer me is worth my integrity
and my ability look myself in
the mirror at night I know that
I cast a vote for the people

Senator Baca Senator Pirtle.
Thank you Mr president thank you

There is an effort by by the
media to try to.
Make Senator Candelaria myself.
But there was an effort between
senator Candelaria and I.
To break through that.
going to break through and
become friends.
Because at the end of the day
senator Candelaria and I both
have the same thing.
So I just wanted the body to
know that that.
Nine years ago there was a an
article actually written trying
to pit us against each other and
despite the odds.

The beauty.
Of the New Mexico state Senate.
You know I'm I'm tired of of
the the the dangers.
Of the route that we have taken

able to come together and say

So when I go home and I see my
wife who's Hispanic.
My children who are spending.
Not for the values of my party.
I will be able to sleep.
I will have rest.
Because I came to this for and I
So I hope the the other members
of this body.
Find it in their hearts and look
closely at what we're doing with
this floor substitute.
And if tonight after this vote
you can look at yourself in the
mirror and say you know what I
did the right thing.
That's you.
But if there's any chance.
In a bipartisan way to do what
was best for New Mexico.
If there's any chance that
you're gonna look at yourself
and so you know what.
I think I goofed up.
Many things.
I've made friends with with
people that I never thought I
would make friends with.
And we realized quickly we're
not that different Mr president.
We both have a passion for the
state we both have a passion for
family.

way.
To be a member of this body.
But within fifteen seconds of
being on this floor I realized

fact.

We set the set down.

And I think that that would have
been okay.
Senator McKenna we haven't met

thank you Mr president.
Debate on the main motion Sierra
Lara.
What more error against the
leaders comment on that.
I represent a district at sixty
some percent Hispanic sorry that
racial disparities in these
maps.
Are not Hispanic so excuse me if
I just don't care what you have
Hispanic thing.
Really.
That's the tagline for the night
from the majority party.
And a good not to my good friend
from the south we were actually
Jewish in the were forced to
convert.
And there was a little ruder
than tonight believe me if we
really want to see what things
were like go back to the Spanish
member that would stand on this
floor and say that we should not
have made this a Hispanic thing.
Other members of gotten up
tonight and falsely praise this
Let me just say again I am I
speaking Greek.
There is facts and then there is
nonsense to say that these maps
were produced by the C. R. C.
Why because again Mr president
the reason I made this a quote
on quote Hispanics saying.
The reason we talked about
But in doing so I'm just rating
representation for our
community.
Because I had no option because
the C. R. C. maps presented
than blind partisan ambition.
And I'm sorry I will make things
a Hispanic serving in the Senate
I will make things a gay thing
in the Senate why.
It doesn't matter that some of
us are Hispanic others are not
and yes I agree but you know
what you can't have.
You can not have that unity
The reason that we had a
Hispanic thing debate tonight.
Because it strikes at the core
of who we are.
my professor at Princeton more
to ten dozens I was cited a site
earlier to go read something I
will say there's a lot of
studying that's been done which
concludes that the fact that the
census bureau keeps Hispanics is
don't identify as racially
Anglo.
So I checked the box Hispanic in
many forms of New Mexico.
You checked the box Hispanic as
your race what I find
Senate floor in a state that is
forty eight percent Hispanic be
criticized.
For making this debate about who
Discussed and referenced your
interest your communities all of
us.
Referred to as things.
The raw against of power behind
the session in that statement.
Founded.
I'm not saying.
Hispanic issues more New Mexico
folks want to get their way.
We talk about unity.
But there can be no unity if
there is not justice act
and because we're just wasting
too much time talking about that
Hispanics saying.
I think speaks volumes the
people's state of New Mexico.
Mr president do a further debate
on the main motion that Senator
Pirtle.
Thank you Mr president and
members of the body.
You know we're we're here at the
and to ensure that we would all
want to be home.
You know I received a text from
from my mom that just says good
evening sun just thinking about
you.
Go walk the hallways.
Mr present we walk.
Right next to the the
president's office.
One day after you're gone people
will remember your name.
Thanks Max you know mom's been a
rough day.
The politics the the the
partisan politics.
That the majority of this body.
That's the reality Mr president.
Five minutes after you walk out
of this building for the last
time.
Mark is really is actually paid
somebody.
To follow him around and say you
are just a man.
You are just a mess.
And it's unfortunate that again
I have to stand up on the floor.
Make another speech.
About that.
From some thought that he had.
We're going to hear the same
criticism.
About members of this body who
Are we going to hear that same
criticism.
He chose to debate Mr president
a bill that's what we are
elected to do.
It's about coming up what is
best for the state.
Not to sit around and wait and
given a scripted speech.
I was invited to stay at his
house.
During the interim.

Hang it low.
Shame on you thank you Mr
president.
I do have further debate.
I wish I had become involved in
some of the negotiations long
time ago.
There was one little thing that
Decided that it wasn't worth the
fight.
Because it didn't need to be a
fight was a little thing that
was important to some people up
there in San Juan County and
still is.
San Juan County legislators at

that are slowly San Juan County
I have always worked together on
big projects.
And we'll do it still.
I've known Shannon.
For a while.
And consider her friend and I am
To get to me.
Because I know Mr president that
we had multiple chances.
I probably would have voted
against anything.
Because I can go home and say

that they were never going to

Mispronounced wants is also
supposed to stand during debate
too so let's make sure we follow
our rules senator Morris wants
that and each time that the
So I think that there's there's
a lot of reasons.
That we failed and I do believe
we failed I believe we failed
We failed mostly because we
didn't talk to each other.
There were lots of outside the
And I've seen that on other
bills people come in here we
know.
And in fact I've even said it.
We can do better.
And all right today saw a path
because we had disrespected
them.
And we did.
We absolutely did.
I don't deny that.
With solid Republican and
Democrat support.
The bill would come out here
What was that lack of respect it
was the lack of respect for each
other a lack of respect from
outside groups to us a lack of
respect from all state outside
In America in in in in New
Mexico and it certainly
shouldn't be in New Mexico.
But I would submit to you Mr
president.
And we should guide the culture.
We should guide the culture with
respect.
For each other.
You Mr president is interesting
I was I was talking with another
Senator on the floor.
Hard to remember now three four
days ago.
In in in in it's really sad.
I think what we've done with
Is we have created greater
division.
We have created greater sadness
for the people of New Mexico.
When we look at the all of the
the measures New Mexico.
Seems to fail on everything
except the beauty of the state.
If we continue to allow the
cultural toxicity.

Plus we could change it.
We could change it tonight.
We could change it tonight.
All we need is is is a handful
It would have strong Republican
and Democrat support would have
strong support from the people
of New Mexico.
But I know we won't do that.
Guide the culture.
I do not think that this map is
good for New Mexico.
I do not think that it fully
interest is how many Republicans
and how many Democrats are in
the state we talked about how
many Hispanics suits and how
many native American seats.
And I understand that.
But I do think that.
Disrespect.
Further into.
Into the pits of failure for our
schools.
For our prime.
That I stood up here.
In Spokane just.
Just because.
I feel like I have no other
power.
I never done it with contempt or
hatred for anybody in this room.
But I ask you to be changeable
if I can venture.
But when we're not allowed to
debate in in this particular
He should have been driven by
disrespect and contempt.
And I don't think that most of
that was intentional.
But it has nothing to do.
With all of the stuff we just
talked about.
With respect for each other and
respect for our constituents.
We can do better.
We could even do better tonight.

stay with our decorum.
And thank you Mr president I
think the decorum between myself
that for ages the bodies have
respected each other.
The Senate does its business the
it was clear.
That the committee process of
the Senate was not going to be
respected.
Very clear.
So I thought it just fair that
the Senate stand up for itself.
Mr president that the Senate
have a spine.
Never in my nine years nearly
ten years what we have I mean we
can stay here for a couple weeks
I suppose and I could say ten
years.
president that there's an
understanding that the New
Mexico state Senate stands with
each other.
Does not allow the house to pick
off members in the Senate.
Senator Moores thank you Mr
president pro I think you make
some very good points I hope the
other side is actually listening
I doubt it this is this is just
a political process as we were
Etcetera etcetera.
Thank you Mr president I Mr.
Will the sponsor the member
yield.
the house with another member.
who's currently serving in the
in the house representatives.
And Mr president would
essentially move the the speaker
of the house into district forty
six.
And Mr present would be
absolutely consistent with what
this body just did but as we
learned in in
is that the speaker of the house
would no longer be in the
district of what she currently
serves and would be paired
against the incumbent in the
other district is that correct
Senator Pirtle and Mr president
in twenty ten to that would be
the effect.
And Mister president senator
that's correct.
Mr president I'd like to revise
my position on this this would
be a friendly amendment.
The amendment has been withdrawn
we do have another floor
amendment.
The reader to read.
Senate floor amendment number
one to house bill eight as
Senator fields are amendment as
agency president this bill was
amended in the Senate rules
committee it was amendment
provided by the chair of the
Senate rules committee actually
that we also at that moment
believed we had in the PC maps
and in the Senate maps however
we realized after the fact that
language did not make it in the
that some of general nature of
clean up in the election code we
don't need to do this at this
time and so simply to withdraw
the amendment that we did and
rules committee Senator Ivey
Soto Mr president the the
sponsor of the amendment Senate
rules committee whose amendment
Senator Senator Baca thank you
Mr president I can identify no
handsome face on that board.
And so does that the sponsor of
is Mr person thank you senator
boxer that would be Senator Ivey
Soto.
Senator Morris was present with
the.
Chair of rules so you'll.
was actually necessary I believe
this morning and I believe I
said it wasn't
and the chair of rules that we
I I don't believe anyone in that
in that discussion was right but
the chair of rules might have
been momentarily mistaken.
Senator Morris Mr president did
Si no further debate on the
floor amendment Senator Ivey
Soto to close I thank very much
Mr president Mr this president I
move Senate floor amendment
number one and ask unanimous
Senator Brandt thank you Mr
president and.
With the sponsor you'll first
Sir I have some concerns with
this map.
With this redistricting.
We concerns me that the house
obviously.
Came over and tried to interfere
with the process of the Senate
and I will tell you I am sick
and tired.
district would have forty for
house district forty four.
And.
Let me explain.
And if you want to take a look
at it I can have sort or just
take the maps around.
For eighteen years.
In fact I love having this
Representative so much.
out of my area and I moved to
stay in her district.
Representative Jane Powdrell
Culbert.
eighteen.
I guess nineteen years now.
She served honorably.
House purposely.
Under the direction.
The speaker.
The areas that support her would
be written out for map.
The area is that she has served.
For eighteen years.
The people in her district
respect her.
And C. helps has served the
state.
For minority communities in the
state.
Yeah what we've done.
As we move toward district.
Is not right.
Can I support this map.
The does that to her.
Fifty fifty on mine.
It's fifty point.
To.
On the current one.
Can you explain to me.
Senator.
Why.
And I understand it's not our
districts.
She has serve this area and this
area in Meyer store and loves
her.
of as president.
At the risk of using a slightly
over used term in terms of
creating communities of
interest.
In the for the last ten years
Is that it unifies Kerala's
it within our district forty
four.
Thank you Mr president Senator
cross is a is a not every city
is a community of interest to
candy in the case across which
is kind of a farming community
with them and a great urban area
Senator Representative so Mister
president.
Senator who who gets to name one
city a community of interest.
Very few farms left but you're
far from the largest one.
It's it's really hard to call it
a harming community anymore yeah
there's a couple forms left.
When there is incredulous.
Yet rearranges being carved up
all over the place.
in this district will have a
little bit of Rio Rancho left in
it how much below that.
community of interest within my
district well used to be within
my district.
Northern meadows considers
itself to be a community of
interest in Rancho.
this year.
But yet this community of
interest because it fits.
What the speaker wants.
Is the one we're gonna call
community of interest I'm sorry
I have a real hard time with
that.
The people of Rio Rancho.
They've interfered with Lars.
Let's put James Helder covert.
Back in Representative Rio
Thank you Mr president.
If the sponsor would you Senator
thirty year old agency present
for my good friend Pat Woods
If you would.
And.
The funny thing about sixty four
at one time it was totally in
curry county.
And a compass is closed and now
that particular district Clovis
is divided three ways.
Why don't you explain that
community the interest deal to
me again Mr president and
senator Ivey Soto Senator so the
population within a particular
area.
and so when looking for
population to be able to fill
out that districts
to extend from Roosevelt County
and a Travis county in order to
make sure that the that there
was a sufficient population for
Sixty four encompass Clovis by
itself.
And there was plenty of
population there in Clovis if
what the deal is Mr president
I'm pretty sure so let me
explain it to you.
And then Senator Ivey Soto.
So that they could do loot.
The influence of of one city.
so we'll just do that that away
with Clovis.
But that seems.
Crazy to me because you could
I know that there's nothing we
can do or not than I can say or
or anything else.
But.
Senator so the whole thank you
Mr president and so was
president what what actually
happened with with regard to
Clovis in general.
It is your right Clovis itself
Union County Harding County.
the eastern side of San Miguel
County and the northern part of
quite County.
in fact Mr president center
what's your district is almost
unchanged because of the
population Clovis offset the
losses.
R. and so and so that's actually
where the incursion into a
Clovis took place of was as a
result of the loss of population
to the north and then that's
The Clovis partylist area and
then you also have district
sixty three that has got a
us population so that sixty
three could otherwise maintained
itself.
As president and Sir what's so
it was it was a consequential a
the west that that created that
situation.
Yes I understand that and and.
those Representative very well.
And.
It's a crazy crazy deal that was
drawn here.
Is to sell this as a community
of interest and I know it's a
futile argument you don't I
don't need to make it anymore.
Senator Ivey Soto to close.
For their consideration and we
trust that they will make no
changes to those maps and and we
will do the same with theirs
although I think many of us can
every ten years and I sympathize
very much with it with the
sentiments expressed by Senator
Woods I think is absolutely
correct about that and if it
does create a difficult
situation particularly in the
call vote Senator states these
we're voting.

for that there's quite a bit of
debate on an item or situation
during Judiciary on on the
significance of why
the committee decided to go with
and with regard to ownership and
control as opposed to ownership
or control.
Senator thank you Mr president
as president.
So part of what came over from
the house.
Excuse me separating out the
Outpatient health care

for the ones that are majority

And controlled hospital they're
captured with the same as the
hospital which is four million
whether it's majority owned and
controlled or majority owned or
controlled or simply majority
owned part or controlled and and
I miss presidents are part of
this is an act that I think
everybody agrees is going to
have to come back to the
legislature either in the thirty
day session or in the sixty day
decision of the Senate rules
committee was to stick with the
language as it came over the
house of the parameter of
majority owned and controlled I
would have the same caps as a
hospital would have at four
fifty thousand dollars for the
next two years.
Mr president and this question
was directed towards the floor
sponsor I sat through the nine
the significance of the and or
with regard to ownership and or
control with regard to hospitals
president to elaborate on the
importance of the debate of the
and or between ownership and or
control and why the committee
decided to go with and control.
thank you on the floor sponsor
has requested to yield Senator
thirty year old agency president
I do yield thank you very much
the reason for the and or
create majority control without
ownership or ownership without
control and get around the
higher caps this is a
significant issue and it's one
that we really do need take a
reviewing very carefully to make
sure that we don't have shell

games being played by certain
hospitals have outpatient health
judiciary please you Senator
this deal.
Yes you Senator Pirtle and thank
you Mr president and perhaps Mr
president and and chair of
judiciary as as we voted
together
can you maybe go into a little
bit more detail on the concerns
with the and or with with regard
to that section of the the law
Senator about us thank you Mr
we could do this all the floor
so I want to make sure that
everyone knows they were spared
the eight or nine hours a
Judiciary and and thank the
Judiciary Committee for sparing
because we're leaving it the way
it is and the way it is will
allow hospitals to of clever
lawyers and not very clever
lawyers this is a second year
facility you just have to show
that the operation facility is
owned and controlled to to avoid
that liability in this case I
other because really the word
and now to avoid liability

owned by less than fifty percent
but also has to be controlled by
folks may think about lawyers
some of us are trying to avoid
creating laws that.
Create more and more litigation
and when we heard the committee
was in this case there seems to
goal here is to make it more
clear we're gonna leave it
unclear.
Senator and thank you Mr
president thank you Mr chair for
standing up for the committee
on fire about thirty minutes ago
but you know that's that's
another point so you know I I
think an important issue here is
you know commonly controlled
that it would lower the premiums
for our providers because it
would fall under the umbrella of
the hospitals in the outpatient
facilities but lost on that
Ten thirty you know we all want
to go home we pass this bill I
voted no.
the last time this bill passed
house bill seventy five I
floor believe by the house
to pass this bill last session
and then here we are again
fixing it so you know I think if
if this is going to be the way
believe Mr president members of
this body because we're no
longer doing the job of the
legislature as as the chair of
judiciary has so eloquently
but that we do have a job.
As the Senate.
and when we're told we can't
amend things this is what we end
So again to all the members of
the body you know I'm really
tired of saying this so please
can we stop doing things like
As a legislative body to the
fourth floor.
We have a proclamation here.
From the governor I can read it
to everybody but I'm sure
everybody here can read.
But if we amended house bill
eleven.
Just reading this it was pretty
specific Mister president
members of this body.
What are you to copy it didn't
take thirty seconds I got a copy
of this thing.
As to what we could change and
But it was more like six hours
yesterday and this morning.
To come up with language.
That didn't create unintended
consequences.
We've been here fifteen days we
could just let the governor do
everything.
Why do we have a judicial branch
why do we have a legislative
branch.
I continue to ask Legislative
Council to draft bills for me
but it appears.
By this proclamation the amended
proclamation.
That instead of us Legislative
body why are we here Mr
president.
I looked around the room there's
a lot of freshmen here.
This is not okay this
We're the legislative branch
we've already proven tonight
that we're going to see our
power to the governor we're
gonna see our power to the lower
house the lower chamber.
our leadership within the house.
Didn't stand up to the governor
on constitutional spending of
federal dollars.
But we had two senators both of
one of them is DTS.
Because of it.
Sitting right in the middle.
We love you of the by the way.
That.
this governor to just absolutely
take the constitution.
Right here.
And flushed down the toilet.
What is not always going to be a
Democrat governor.
Everybody is willing to fight
the governor when it's a
Republican including myself.
wife in this my kids miss my mom
miss everything great and Travis
county.
But you know everything that
And the position that you hold
in trust.
To your constituents.
My very good senator from
Albuquerque said.
is unconstitutional this is a
joke.
An absolute joke that the that
the governor would dictate to
us.
Show bring forth object or
objects for discussion.
Still specify objects not
To allow this to happen.
It was bad enough when they
would due to two numbers out of
the governor's office.
It's ridiculous.
We had a Republican governor
that vetoed without a message I
remember sitting on the floor
You have to give your
objections.
Even if the objection is I don't
like the sponsor.
It's simple.
those in charge but then let the
governor when it's a party that
we're within.
Do whatever they want and
absolutely make a joke.
we know everything that's going
to happen this is absolutely
necessary but this proclamation
should be an embarrassment to
every single member of this
body.
this why do we even show up
just.
Madam governor passed a
legislation that you want and
then we'll just be a rubber
stamp.
But that's why we set up this
process a hundred and twelve
minds are better than one.
They are.
say that as we we do issues like
this and we address issues like
this are we going to continue to
let this governor bully the
legislature are we going to get
us fine and push back thank you
I think I may have this figured
out.
But just in case said don't let
me make a statement here.
When we start talking about the.
And we say down and that's in
the middle of the page to in the
F.

participants and they make their
decision on how that stuff is
going to be.
Of.
Senator.
Health.
Thank you Mr president I yield
to Senator Ivy Soto Soto thank
blue pages.
That you were passed out at the
beginning of this you'll see
subsection hi.
Recognizes that deficit and says
outpatient health care facility
and not by the fund.
And then beginning January one
twenty twenty seven.
we we recognize that there is a
deficit and we are providing
actually for affected really
self insurance by the hospitals
money can.
Senator what's that Mr president
again who makes up the deficit
in that fund when we were at a
doctors in the hospitals pay for
the death deficits the offices
superintendent insurance sets
surcharges.
To pay for the deficit over the
next five years.
Human Services Department
reports said HB eleven will not
result in increased costs to

The the the rider that the
Health care providers is what is
funding this fund
assuming Mister president.
Senator I think was president
Mr president I didn't quite
catch that explain that one more
time Senator certainly agency
president so the officer percent
of insurance says the
surcharges.
R. for the doctors and
hospitals.
But during this period of time
until that deficit is made up.
Senator Wirth
Mr president.
But someone has to pay it.
And I'm assuming the state in
New Mexico stands behind this
get at that you're saying in
five years we will make this
deficit up through insurance
premiums.
Mr president.
This president out yes act
absolutely your you're correct
this presents at our words in
fact of the twenty two twenty
twenty two budget
Because the state of New Mexico
does stand behind it.
I thought that might be the case
Mister president thank you very
much.
what's questions will more and
more detail but I'd like to
begin because there was early
criticism of the governor for
bowling of the medical
malpractice act this last year
by the governor and so I can
tell you as a participant number
of that I I don't think that's
fair.
The reason I can say that in
part is because I want to
And it wasn't the governor's
bowling it was.
Again one of the situations that
we've seen a little bit during
this session which is we were
told that everybody had been at
the table they have been working
told that we dotted across the
T. did anything to change it all
the whole deal with blow up.
And I lacked the.
The back room.
And so I apologize to you.
And and I hope not to make that
mistake again.
Because the perfect deal that we
were told had been negotiated
very serious flaws flaws that
indeed could have put our
individual health care providers
are individual doctors into a
very difficult situation if not
put them out of business budget
Emily.
recognized that need as well to
I support that.
But we should talk about what
else this does you heard a
little bit about it this that's
more than just protect
individual doctors which we all
up to four million dollars in
the coming year twenty twenty
two.
And insure themselves for up to
four million dollars in twenty
twenty two bit greed to insure
themselves up to four and a half
Where orthopedic procedures are

Matt well any number of
different procedures described
in great detail what I have.
outpatient facilities and out
going under general anesthesia
the deal has been rolled back.
Instead of being liable for four
million dollars in twenty twenty
Maybe that's a good thing maybe
that's we needed to do but we're
doing it in such a rush matter
under the circumstances we're
simply hearing these companies
That own eighty hundred
hospitals around the country.
And so.
Will tell you they can't get
four million dollars insurance
but I gotta tell you.
So what we're trying to protect
individual doctors rightfully so
we're also protecting big big
corporations.
Multibillion dollar corporations
here in and I I think that
practice or serious injuries
we're denying them a recovery
beyond the seven hundred fifty
thousand recover they agreed to
to live with the lead up to and
And as we get at the end of the
two year grace period where now
allowing these outpatient
facilities I'm gonna make a
prediction that in two years
from now or sooner we'll see
other efforts to begin to roll
Senator Woods US of up about the
patient compensation I said I
want to explore that but here's
what is supposed to happen you
asked about the solvency and
who's supposed to bail it out.
The fund is supposed to be paid
for by assessments made by the
superintendent insurance against
hospitals.
The superintendent fail to do
that.
ensure the solvency of the
patient compensation fund and
right now it's reported to be in
deficit.
And we've also heard that the
superintendent insurance is now
saying that they want thirty
To go into the patient
compensation fund to make up for
the fact the hospitals were not
adequately assessed to keep the
solvency of the fund and that's
into supporting hospitals so
they didn't have to pay the
adequate amount of assessments
keep that fund solvent.
We should ask ourselves about
why.
Why that's right.
I I I appreciate the work I'm
going to support the the bill I
think it's important to do but
we did spend a lot of time in
Judiciary because we begin to
When I was discuss the things we
talked about in our caucuses but
limited let me offer one thing
from our caucus I think I can
see it because it's what I say
and I think what I say in our
insta parties and we shouldn't
touch it.
I should have trusted myself
more.
And then I wanted to share that
with all of you because I hope
all of you will always feel.
