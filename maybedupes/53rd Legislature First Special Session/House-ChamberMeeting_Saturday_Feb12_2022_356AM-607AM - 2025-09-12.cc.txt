Representative.
But to.
Of all the.
Representative Nibert back to
the chamber of we are back in
business.
You have the floor Sir.
Thank you Mr speaker will you
get me to where I was.
That's okay.
The record reflect.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
And.
Section two
B. for and I'm having to refer
to sections because I'm looking
at the amendments and contacts
version.
Section ten.
B. for.
R. having trouble wrapping my
head around the language here.
This as an opportunity
enterprise blue shell.
Be bound only by the terms of
the lease and any rules
promulgated pursuant to the
provisions of the opportunity
the enterprise that.
So far re that ride the leases
only down by the lease.
Plus the rules is is that is
that how you would read the.
Mr speaker gentleman yes.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
Lease.
Creates a relationship and I
guess in this instance is the
state the last four or the
lessee.
Mr speaker and gentleman the
state will be leasing from the
fund and
They will be the lease or.
From the fund and then for the
for side the lessee of the fund
and the lease or to the partner.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
you're going to have to explain
that to me because I don't
understand thank you Mr speaker
done and so in the case of
financing and leasing the fund.
Owns the property.
They that the fund and NMFA
contract with General Services
Department.
General Services Department
which is the state.
Then leases.
Sublease is and that's a better
word the property out maintains
that and.
So that's the.
Relationship.
So Mister speaker and gentle
lady
We have more than one
transaction occurring between
the partners and is that
correct.
Mr speaker gentleman the state
is maintained is managing the
property because that is one of
the functions of GST
The New Mexico finance authority
doesn't manage properties and so
that's why.
There are.
In the middle so to speak.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
Reviews.
The term loan.
The borrowing of money.
And now we're jumping into a
different realm and that is the
leasing of real property.
So my question Mr speaker and
gentle lady was.
Are there two separate
transactions being involved
between the so called partners
of state of New Mexico and
originally the borrower and now
apparently the Leslie.
Mr speaker gentleman there are
three separate types of
assistance that can be provided
the financing the leasing for
the loan.
Mr speaker and gentle lady with
the loan in the financing not be
one in the same.
Mr speaker gentleman no they are
distinct in this.
Mr speaker and gentle lady could
you describe the distinctions
between the financing aspects
and the Lente aspects Mr speaker
gentleman yes as I mentioned
before the.
Two scenarios.
Under the first scenario the
state the fund finances the
project and owns the project it
then leases the space.
In the other scenario.
This the fund provides the loan
for the guarantee.
So Mister speaker and gentleman
for those will be.
Major League schools of.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes Mr
speaker and gentle lady there
would be no.
Situation where the state would
be financing the purchase of
property and then lease payments
to the partner.
The last three.
And also granting a separate
loan because that four I
understand you to say Mr speaker
gentleman yes.
And on the reverse side if the.
Project involves only the
landing of money.
There would not be involving
financing and a leasing of real
property Mr speaker and
gentleman that's part.
Okay.
The.
Again getting back to.
The lease is bound only by the
lease and the.
Rules.
It
seems to me that if you are.
Involving the
Particularly larger sums of
money there would be other types
of agreements and I think we've
seen
Some of those so.
This might be
To technical but.
The lease is bound only by the
lease and the rules generally a
lease involving substantial sums
of money.
Is going to have provisions and
that that would bring them.
Other agreements that may also
control
And there may be some other
agreements involving.
Some.
Other documents that the law
requires would.
Oversee the relationship between
these two so called partners.
And so I just the
I'm a little concerned that the
this is so women being here.
I'm not asking for responses
just a little surprising that
the language is like it is it
doesn't seem to give the the
flexibility that one would want
in most significant transactions
instructional Levin's program
G..
It calls for the ability to
sign.
A year and see.
Thorley being the state with
Verint T. I guess a private loan
and other incidents would not.
Mr speaker down to then yes.
Mr speaker and gentle lady in
the event that the state signs
are guaranteed to a private
lender guaranteeing a private
loan to.
The so called partner.
With the partner also be
receiving money from the state.
In addition to that financial
guarantee that the states
putting them Mr speaker
gentleman now.
So in that case Mr speaker and
gentle lady.
They can't get.
More money from the finance
authority the finances so four
forty is simply being the
guarantor of a private loan and
if they do fall the state will
make the on that.
Amount loan by.
Private lending institutions to
that to that lender at current.
Mr speaker gentleman yes.
Mr speaker and gentle lady my
biggest fear with this.
Is that often times government.
Does some things that are well
intentioned.
And then we get to see it on TV.
That I recall.
A number of months ago.
Watching I believe it was one of
the Albuquerque stations talking
about L. Camino Riel visitors
center and focal County.
About thirty miles south of San
Antonio.
The upshot of that investigation
was of the state of New Mexico
and the federal government spent
five million dollars to build as
visitors center.
But but a lot of nice things and
it.
And I'm like the building dreams
no one came.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I'm
not I'm.
You know not trying to make
light of this but the fact of
the matter is the taxpayers
spent five million dollars to
build something that was never
utilized.
And.
I am concerned.
That this.
Legislation.
As the discussed by the
representative from we.
This legislation is going to
lead to.
Some news reports ten fifteen
twenty years down the road.
Or maybe I.
Where we have land substantial
sums of money.
And we're gonna be left holding
the bag.
And we will have failed the
people New Mexico.
Because.
This board despite the charge in
here to point to provide
safeguards to protect public
money.
Will be an capable.
Doing that very thing.
We're going to suffer losses.
M. Larry Barker the next
generation alert barkers gonna
be stuck in some microphones in
people's faces asking why do we
build something why did we land
something why do we do this and
that.
And we're gonna be held
accountable for.
Maybe we won't be held
accountable for because of
turnover this body is forty
forty substantial.
But no one and the FAA's gonna
be held accountable for but
somebody's going to look at.
Representative office at that
time and say.
We demand answers and the I'm
afraid that we are getting into
some things that the frankly the
state of New Mexico has no
business getting into for that
reason I can not to support the
legislation thank you Mr speaker
thank you John gentle lady there
is further debate the gentleman
from Dona Ana grant and share a
Representative finances.
Thank you Mr speaker will
generally please yield.
Mr speaker yes I will yield to
the gentleman from Dona Ana
grant and Sierra counties.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
I just I have a lot of questions
and I'm sorry it's really late
in on.
Many keep pushing for but I was
trying to understand how this is
going to
Comply with the federal Indian
that.
Mr speaker gentleman of this.
Banks.
Mr speaker gentle lady on.
Lente is this alone right.
Ari bending.
Mr speaker and gentleman The New
Mexico finance authority is not
subject to the.
For landing Act.
Mr speaker gentle lady I agree
with you up until you start
winning to private individuals I
was kind of reading here.
I think that would change the.
The Lente it would be lending to
municipalities and other
governmental agencies that would
now be involving private
entities.
Mr speaker Johnson I apologize
was there a question there.
I'm sorry well my question is
Do you believe that the lending
Act will then.
The
I being that now well let me
rephrase is.
The finance authority currently
land to private private
entities.
Mr speaker gentleman yes.
So a private individual of.
Individual or a company can can
borrow money from friends four.
Mr speaker gentleman yes.
Okay so.
Mr question I was trying to
think of of.
Loan to value
What you would do and as far as.
I'm a supporter of loan so that
I can along side of the
circumstances are going to be in
provisions of the loan to value
the.
Mr speaker gentleman there will
be but they're not established
yet.
I just don't understand how
you're gonna get from landing on
Fairland.
And because of interest rates
and so forth but
is there any.
Is it going to be any surveys
how are you gonna handle
construction loans.
I'm assuming they're gonna some
of this will be new
construction.
Mr speaker gentleman yes if it's
if there's construction they
will require all of the things
required for construction loan.
So generally a construction loan
the land and then once of all.
Project is complete then it goes
to a permanent landing.
Is that how it's going to be
handled Mr speaker going.
Mr speaker and gentleman all of
that could potentially be
handled.
In the New Mexico finance
authority.
So they would have just two
different loans or would that be
a prospect just trying to
understand this is.
The understanding of Mr speaker
the only I'm just trying to
press my my mind around how this
can be structured thank you Mr
speaker gentleman yes NMFA could
convert it.
From a construction loan.
To a permanent one.
Okay and then
I was trying to understand what
taxes would be and when I do see
anybody asset or maybe if they
did I sorry Sir.
Read something that
Of taxes what taxes with those
being Mr speaker gentle lady.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman of those would be in
the event that the fund owns the
property and so the payment of
taxes would
go to the county or district
that otherwise would have
received the taxes.
Okay thank you thank you Mr
speaker daily the other question
I had when when you land is it
going to be a floating or fixed
rate I know that you have this
this range but I just didn't
know what what grandmothers
were.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman of those have not been
established yet.
Okay.
Mr speaker gentle lady is our
clinic going to be any caps as
far as how little or how much
you're able to sent to went to
one of our work.
Mr speaker gentleman of there
will be but those would be we
don't know those yet those would
be set up during the rules.
Is that gonna be also with some
collateral and and you're gonna
be service required isn't going
to be I just don't understand
why there's going to be closing
on this Mr speaker Dylan.
How the closing will be handled.
Mr speaker and gentleman all of
that will be established in the
rules and.
The NMFA currently does
construction loans right now.
And that was just okay well just
move forward is is is this
program loan program manager can
take on any deposits.
Early.
Mr speaker and gentleman no NMFA
cannot take deposits by law.
Thank you Mr speaker Dolly I'm
just and I was just there was a
lot of questions and I think a
lot of these are establishment
and so I'm I was just trying to
get Representative I'm around my
mind around all this but and
then once I had read about stuff
most of the other individuals
and ask you a lot of questions
and I know you're trying to
To do something positive but I
just I'm struggling to
understand how it's for me
because then we put together
because a lot of our unanswered
questions
is there gonna be early payment
of the payment it'll need for
paying the loan off early
because I know that the
restriction on.
The amount of time that they can
borrow no less than fifteen
years no more than thirty.
Mr speaker gentleman there is no
early repayment penalty.
Okay.
I guess I was gonna ask about
those other things I think a lot
of what I'm asking Mr speaker
gentle lady are things that
apparently haven't been
established yes
I'm assuming of those borders is
gonna handle all those things
and I just there's just a lot of
questions here and I was just
trying to understand the
structure of the loan and and
how it would meet those
requirements.
Commercial lending how you're
going to going to
What you're hearing she.
Would be how much you would
maximum guarantee you know what
that maximum guarantee would be
Mr speaker dollars.
Mr speaker gentleman all of that
will be established through the
rules.
Okay Mister speaker generally so
if.
Somebody came and borrowed
wanted to build a something for
twenty thirty million dollars
this one would be able to handle
that Mr speaker speaker gentle
lady as far as a Jack of
guarantee.
Mr speaker gentleman.
Those criteria the limits will
be established during the rule
making.
Thank you Mr speaker only the
I'm I'm not gonna keep going
down the all my questions
because it's mostly.
All of the rules will probably
be established later on thank
you Mr speaker generally.
Thanks for the general
involuntarily.
Thank you Mr speaker does the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
yield.
Mr speaker I do yield.
Thank you gentle lady and thank
you Mr speaker
as the previous a gentleman was
what was had brought up the
question on the bills.
so Mister speaker and generally
that's where I'm aware that's
kind of what I'm gonna head on
I'm I need some clarification on
that.
so generally earlier you had
made the comment that DFA does
will not own these properties
but the fund will is is that
correct Mr speaker and gentle
lady.
Mr speaker gentle lady the fund
which is that NMFA.
Will owned on the property.
Thank you gentle lady and and
thank you Mr speaker so in
layman's terms at bit it is a
actually a state agency that
that would.
Own these properties is that
correct gentle lady Mr speaker.
Mr speaker gentle lady I'm
technically it's a because I
state entity.
Thank you gentlelady in Mr
speaker so there's a because I
state agency are they exempt
from property taxes gentlelady.
Mr speaker gentle lady yes.
Thank you gentle lady Mr speaker
I'm so.
For example I'm I'm assuming let
me let me see if I'm getting
this right gentle lady Mr
speaker
so if the property was moved
into this category for this
purpose with those properties be
removed from the tax rolls the
county level.
Mr speaker gentle lady yes.
Thank you gentle lady Mr
speaker.
So generally.
A couple of questions with them
to that.
So.
First off generally and and Mr
speaker on page three of the
bill it talks about payments in
lieu of taxes.
Gives the the description and
the definition of what that is.
let's see on.
Find the page the line number.
So on starting on page three
online nine it talks about the
opt in agreement an agreement
entered into among the the
authority the department and
they County municipality or
school districts that ensures
compliance with all local zoning
permitting and other land use
rules.
and that provides for payments
in lieu of taxes to the county
municipality or school
districts.
So generally how is
The bills.
I'm going to be how is that
amount going to be determined
gently Mr speaker.
Madam speaker the sorry Mr
speaker gentle lady that amount
is.
To go she did and put into the
opt in agreement.
Thank you gentle lady Mr speaker
so would there need to be an
appraisal done on the property
or gentle lady Mr speaker would
that be what the tax bases what
the property would earn in
taxes.
Can you kind of give me an idea
on how that would be calculated.
Speaker gentle lady would be
based on current tax rules.
Thank you gentle lady and Mr
speaker so.
scenario.
A.
Partner wants to enter into an
agreement they have a vacant
piece of land that's on the tax
rolls.
That.
We'll just say twenty thousand
dollars for a vacant piece of
land gentle lady Mr speaker and
they they want to use the money
and they want to build a I don't
know Intel or big building
Amazon.
And so the value of that
property once that would be
completed would potentially be
different than what the value of
the property was prior to the
bills gentle lady so.
Can you tell me a generally Mr
speaker.
Are we looking at what the
property taxes would have been
existing or what they would be
with the improvement on the
property.
Mr speaker gentle lady
as it says in subsection J.
it is an amount negotiated and
determined in the opt in
agreement among the authority
the department in the county
school district or if applicable
unisa polity where the
enterprise development project
is located in the same
proportional amount as property
tax revenues are normally
distributed to those recipients.
Thank you gentle lady and Mr
speaker that was going to be my
next.
Point.
line twenty one and the same
proportional amount as property
tax revenues are normally
distributed to these recipients
that's pretty brought in my
opinion gentlelady normally
could be normally a vacant piece
of land that has a brand new
structure on that's worth three
million dollars and the tax base
would be dramatically different.
gentle lady Mr speaker.
The intent of
I guess my question would be is
the intent of this to keep those
entities that receive those
property tax dollars whole for
instance the school districts
the.
What the water authorities the
those different entities is is
that the intent.
Mr speaker gentle lady yes the
intent is to make make them
whole.
Thank you for that gentle lady
Mr speaker
so let's go down another what if
gentlelady Mr speaker.
So if the fund.
Holds these properties.
And the the person that is in
this building is is paying the
bill to the local government who
is in distributing those funds
to their entities.
Can you give me an example of
what would happen if that
partner as we call them earlier
forty default.
Gentle lady Mr speaker would who
would pay those bills payments
to that local government to fund
those schools Mr speaker gentle
lady the fund.
Thank you for that gentle lady
The.
Gently you Mr speaker is there
any.
Forgive me I haven't made it all
the way through the bill at this
late hour but is there a act
terming a time limit on on how
long these these loans would
would be in effect gentlelady.
Mr speaker gentle lady for no
less than fifteen and no more
than thirty years.
Thank you generally and Mister
speaker so at the end of the of
the loner lease or agreement for
better terms I can't gather at
this late hour.
What would then happen to the
property would it then go back
on the tax rolls and and the tax
of the normal tax rate.
Mr speaker gentle lady in a loan
scenario the property is not
coming off the tax rolls.
In the financing and leasing
scenario at the opt in agreement
and.
The fund would
make sure that the taxes are
paid.
Thank you gentle lady for that
answer but I'm sorry you just
contradicted yourself.
you are correct gentle lady and
Mr speaker that in traditional
mortgage situations those
properties are not removed from
tax rules they are still subject
to property taxes but you stated
earlier that since this is going
through a fund the because that
I.
Government entity.
That would be a different that
am I wrong.
Mr speaker gentle lady there are
three.
Ways for financial assistance
financing which in this case
means that the fund owns the
property leasing.
And then the other scenario is
the loan and the loan or the
loan guarantee.
The.
Partner.
Owns the property and the and
and pays the taxes.
Thank you gentle lady and and Mr
speaker
This way it kind of bothers me
I'll be honest with you I'm I'm
very concerned of that
with bills I've seen gentlelady
and and Mr speaker that we've
gotten guarantees
from the federal government
water bill payments are going to
be.
And then those are dramatically
reduced and that has you know
that cause a hardship on our
local governments
that then you know share that
with the school districts and
and fund those you know
important things at the local
level generally
I I think there's a lot of
questions and I think there's a
lot of devil's in the details
that may happen in rural.
and I certainly certainly hope
that gentle lady Mr speaker that
our schools and and local
governments don't suffer with
this legislation thank you for
answer my questions thank you Mr
speaker.
Next generation really a.
Thank you Mr speaker looking
online it looks like the.
New Mexico authority finance
authority salaries for a
financial plan was about sixty
five thousand.
And when we look at seeing if
the the for a loan officer they
were on about fifty seven to
seventy four with the senior
analyst running and the senior
Lente of officer read about a
hundred thirty seven two hundred
sixty thousand.
Thank you Mr speaker I just want
to.
Rise of the body of what those
numbers were thank you the
gentleman next Jennifer curry
thank you Mr speaker will gentle
lady please have.
Mr speaker I will yield to the
gentleman from curry thank you
delayed it one quick question
and I I think there's been a
million questions and there's
only one left so I'll ask it
alright and did you would you
refer to your bill together did
you notice in Colorado or
Oklahoma or Texas had a bill
that was very similar to this.
Mr speaker and gentleman that is
a wonderful question and in fact
as we were putting this bill
together we reached out to a
variety of stakeholders and
knowledgeable partners and
looked at different statutes in
states such as Ohio Virginia
Washington DC
Massachusetts I don't
particularly remember what
statutes may have may exist in
Colorado but yes we did a review
of the state.
Statewide programs and we also
consulted with experts such as
Deloitte.
Mr speaker gentle lady I I think
I heard yes this is similar to
programs that are in other
states is that correct Mr
speaker gentle lady Mr speaker
and gentleman I would not say
that it's similar I would say
that we were doing our research
and identifying features and
aspects that we felt that some
of the needs that we're looking
for here in New Mexico.
Okay.
The lady Mr speaker hours really
laid out this is say no it's not
summer to Colorado or Texas or
something like that so that for
thank you delay and I I commend
you on your strength and stamina
gentleman from Chavis at in
terra thank you Mr speaker I
have two questions.
Can lady.
We.
Mr speaker I will yield to the
leader from
Chavis Eddy and Otero there was

gentle lady can this law can
this item be used to fund a new
start up all and gas company.

provision of needed services and
commodities to diverse

the increase of tax and other
revenues revenue collections
resulting from the enterprise

Mexico to item number nine
gentleman from Bernalillo
chairman Romero are you ready
and I don't.
And Mr speaker let the record
reflect that all actually a
series of placing house bill one
nineteen on final passage has
been taken.
Gentleman to explain.
Thank you Mr speaker house bill
one nineteen is a bill that
we've heard a couple years ago
that would be increased the
state match for public school
capital outlay in order to
improve their facilities it's
something we repealed during the
special session about a year and
a half ago but we're looking at
to begin.
Stand for questions gentleman
percent of all.
Thank you Mr speaker does the
kind gentleman from.
In which carrier from gentleman
earlier Bernalillo thank yous
kind gentleman from Bernalillo
deal.
Speaker I yield.
Gentleman.
I have a few questions
So I guess the first one that
you lead with us and your
introduction of this legislation
was that we had essentially done
this a few years ago.
speaker and gentleman can you.
perhaps speak to the differences
here between this version and
the version that we had
implemented prior.
Mr speaker and gentleman it's
the exact same.
Speaker and gentleman the the
formulas that are in.
Section two in the distributions
and section four these are all
the same from which we had
enacted in the past is that
correct.
The speaker gentlemen yes.
Okay speaker and gentleman and
then a little bit into the
detail that and all the all ask
about to why we repealed but.
the speaker and gentleman.
Senator Bill.
We we call SB nine I'm assuming
that's because it was a Senate
bill nine was passed many moons
ago.
but really this is a capital
improvement expenditures for K.
through twelve.
School districts and charter
schools that's what we talk
about SB nine funding that's
what we're really talking about
is capital improvements for for
school
facilities that correct.
Speaker and gentleman that's
correct.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman had and
hi I have not served on any of
the interim committees
associated with us except for
spending a little time on
legislative finance and.
I know that there's been a lot
of progress over the years
improving
the conditions of our
facilities are for K. through
twelve education and there's an
index here I think it's
FCRA
and I and I can't recall the to
the action this facility
something Mr John and you can
you help me with that that
afternoon and and how that.
Numbers calculated.
Speaker that says these
condition index.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman from Bernalillo and
how and what what is that how do
we calculate that index so we
can talk about how it's
improved.
Mr speaker I'm I'm certain of
that.
you Mr speaker and gentleman
my understanding is in of this
is this information a little old
in my brain but it's R. ratio
essentially of how much it would
cost to repair.
versus how much it would cost to
replace.
And so if this number is hi.
that means that repair costs are
high versus
replacing if it's low that means
of repair costs are are good
versus replacing and that's what
we really wanted to be is in a
place that we're not just
replacing all the buildings all
the time but we get our
facilities in a place where
actually repairing them.
Is
It is less expensive because the
facilities are in good condition
the speaker and gentleman I I
believe that's right and and
I'll be happy to stand corrected
if if that's not the case but we
have spent
Mr speaker and gentleman do you
recall how much.
The state has spent in improving
our.
K. to twelfth Saudis census was
enacted shortly after the the
lawsuit.
Speaker gentleman it's been
about two point six billion
dollars over the past twenty
years speaker John and I think
that's amazing that is really a
cause to I think I stand back
and and and maybe not celebrate
police to see we've really made
a huge investment in
infrastructure for our our
schools and we've seen an
incredible decrease in this of
the city's
The index facility condition
index it used to be around
seventy percent and now it's
gone down to fifty two percent
so and some districts it looks
like it's going to forty percent
so so really impressive changes.
Okay so.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
One question and I don't know
the answer to this one and then
hoping you do
I am I'm looking at the tables
of that show the increase that
each district will receive.
And funding and I'm just
noticing how.
why did the spectrum is
you have some districts they're
getting a two percent increase
know some districts that are
getting a two hundred and eighty
six percent increase
and of course when you look at
the actual dollars you know it
perhaps makes sense why this
range is so wide but can you
explain to me.
Based off of this were formula
in in section two of your bill
why we see some districts
receiving just a little bit and
summer districts receiving a lot
of these percentage wise.
You Mr speaker and gentleman
that's because I've property
value districts are going to
receive a little bit less of
these formula changes and the
lower property value districts
are going to receive more and
that was part of the impetus
behind beach using the lawsuit
is of these districts of lower
property values were not able to
get as much money in order to to
fund their facilities.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
really I I I I I believe you I I
think that's that's partially
correct but I'm still looking at
this list and I see places like.
the Los crucis receiving a
hundred and six percent for you
have places like gel receiving
eight percent so it's not that
doesn't give us the whole story
is there is there more to help
us understand that Mr speaker
and gentleman.
students Mr speaker and
gentleman Jalen your example has
a pretty high property values
per student which is why you're
seeing some of these differences
but ultimately that was the goal
of these changes for the low
property values schools to gain.
More.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman I've.
Appreciate that answer I mean it
be nice to.
You know for all the districts
that have received something you
know meaningful not just a you
know I'm looking at you know him
as Melanie it's a two percent
bond
but I understand how the you
know when you put a formula in
legislation it's it's never
perfect there's always pros and
cons but least Mr John you've
set this up so that every
district it's an increase in you
don't have a case where some
districts are receiving glass is
that correct Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Mr speaker and gentleman that
seems correct.
The speaker John and looking at
the tables I don't I don't see
any negative percentages here so
I think that's right.
Okay Mister speaker gentleman
going to now what is dollars
actually come from Mr speaker
and gentleman does are we
looking at any tax increases
here or how it how are we paying
for this extra distribution.
Mr speaker gentleman no they're
not additional taxes in order to
funds.
Speaker and gentleman that
that's my understanding as well
so where is this funding coming
from.
Speaker gentleman this public
school capital outlay fund.
Mr chairman that's that's
exactly right and we're doing
the dollars from the public
school capital outlay fund come
from.
The speaker gentleman the
supplemental severance tax
bonds.
speaker and gentleman that
that's exactly right and every
year when we get distributions
from severance taxes which are
taxes that are collected when we
suffer minerals
we'll gas copper etcetera one of
the taxes Senators taxes once on
public land.
And every year we bond to those.
revenues and Mr Chairman are you
do you know the percentage of.
That bonded revenue that goes to
the public school capital outlay
fund.
Well.
Mr speaker and gentleman I I
don't know if you have the
answer I would appreciate that.
Mr speaker and and gentleman my
I think it's important for us to
understand because this directly
affects our capital outlay that
we have as legislators but my
understanding my recollection.
Is that of that whole pie.
We have some your marks we have
nine percent goes to water we
have four and a half that goes
to colonias projects.
Forty percent that goes to
tribal projects.
and I think there's a bill that
will earmarking other two point
five of that for before the
housing which is not the subject
of this debate but I think it's
about idea and then I think
fifty five percent goes to
public school capital outlay
sort of a huge chunk.
And then the balance
there's a portion that goes to
the permanent fund in the
balances what we as legislators
get two yes you know upstate
with the governor for our
capital outlay projects so
that's where these dollars come
from so Mister speaker and
gentleman we're not raising
taxes but why can we increase
the distributions from this
fund.
Mr speaker and gentleman in the
public school capital outlay
fund there's significant
balances with.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
that's my understanding as well
and that kind of makes sense
because we've made such
significant progress in
improving the condition of our
schools that maybe we can
actually come to a point where
we start seeing some.
Balances where we actually do
not cover all that money right
away but Mr speaker do you and
gentleman you know with the
current balance is.
In the.
School capital outlay.
Fund.
Sorry Mr speaker and gentleman
would you mind repeating that
question refreezing Mr percent
Gino the balance you just tell
us.
Mr speaker and I I do but I I
think it's a lot easier when we
have a back and forth instead of
just everyone glazing over as I
talk for thirty minutes.
It's it it would have came
gentleman.
So Mr speaker and gentleman you
you mentioned that there is a
balance in the fund.
And by from reading this right
it looks like the uncommitted
balance for the fund in FY
twenty two is about three
hundred and ninety five million
dollars which which is huge
right and when we sure.
in the media stories about how
we have a billion dollars of on
spend capital outlay funding.
I think it's just important for
members to know you know we
often get beat up for that and
got all you members you have all
your little pet projects and are
not.
The move the money's not moving
well if you added up all of our
little projects quote unquote I
think we probably do not get to
right now the unencumbered
balance of this fund.
so that billion dollars really
in addition of all capital a
projects that includes public
school capital outlay colonias
tribal water trust fund all
those things is how we get that
whole billion dollar number.
Mr speaker Joanna says also hear
that the council anticipates
this fund will increase in
balance to.
Seven hundred and ninety five
million by fiscal year twenty
six.
Source courtesy a huge increase
in this fund speaker John and
I'm guessing that's why you feel
that this time it's appropriate
to bring this bill forward again
to perhaps increase a little bit
more as the distributions from
this fund.
Senator John and what if if we
pass this legislation what will
be the net increase overall
dollars coming out of the the
fund in addition.
Mr leader gentleman it'd be
about a minute let them million
dollars.
So Mr chairman thank you for
that.
And I guess some of the follow
up on that would be just looking
at these next several years how
many.
As a million dollars will be in
here do you know has the.
Public school capital outlay
committee.
Order about.
kind of the more long term are
we just going to continue to
increase dollars
For.
Or or the perhaps other ways
that we can start using this of
these dollars because I I could
see that will have us on a
billion dollars in this fund and
then what we do with it.
speaker John and you do you know
how if or something about him.
Perhaps changes to the structure
now we have a.
Schools in a good place and a
growing balance.
Mr speaker and and and gentleman
from Santa the proposal capital
outlay council is looking to
expand except more applications
and more frequently and this is
a way to try to expedite that
process in order to get the cash
flow into to our schools and and
and facilities.
Speaker and and generally I'm
happy to hear that and all the
others mentioned to I mean
obviously I know my district the
best since I lived there my kids
go to school there and I know
that it's challenging for us
public schools to qualify for
this money
And then there's several reasons
why
But Mr Angelman.
Do you receive perhaps now that
we're looking at having more
applications.
accepted in such that.
Perhaps it would be a revisiting
of the criteria so that perhaps
when Rio Rancho wants to build
another elementary school that
we don't have to.
Pay for the entire school by
ourselves like we have in the
past.
Mr speaker and gentleman I
haven't heard any sort of
discussion around that in the
council.
Speaker and gentleman
but thank you I appreciate that
answer I sure hope the council
is considering that I mean I
really just looking at this four
hundred million dollar balance
and wondering why.
Rio Rancho is continually being
told.
Here's your five million for
upkeep but any time you you're
talking about building a new
school.
you guys are on your own so I
would sure hope that that
becomes part of the discussion
Mr speaker and gentleman.
the other question you mentioned
speaker John in the beginning.
Of your introduction that we
have this in place.
But then
it was repealed Mr John and was
that because this had a.
The original legislation or was
there.
got a conscious effort to remove
it I'm to explain the
circumstances of why it was
removed.
Chair Mister speaker and
gentleman it was because of the
decline in oil prices due to the
pandemic.
So Mr speaker and gentleman
I'm I'm not sure that's quite
right I mean yes the oil prices
did go down and we did have a
pandemic.
Speaker and gentleman my
understanding is and again I
might have to stand corrected.
Is that when we had to come in
and adjust our budget because
our spending had increased by
too much.
That one of the solutions was to
take some of this
severance tax bonded dollars to
help.
About the general fund.
And so Mr leader gentleman it's
is that your your recollection
as well that we needed to use
some of these dollars to help
with the general fund and that's
why but we.
Two weeks temporarily if we pass
this we decrease these these
distributions.
Mr speaker and gentleman I mean
and then it's also been the that
there was a decline in the
expected revenue for that
upcoming fiscal year why we
and to all the staff.
Gentleman I appreciate the way
back to just remind members at
five AM
snowstorm has started outside
receiving some word from the
staff they're getting concerned
about.
getting home for a short nap so
if we have a few questions as
certainly fine but if we could
keep the debate is tight as it
can be I respect the staff who
have been here going on.
eight hours I think you be nice
to have some consideration for
them to let them have a chance
to maybe get an hour and a half
or so before they're back here
working so I understand we want
to have lengthy debates here but
let's give a moment's thought to
that given by the women and men
there working here today Mike is
rest for back to do the work
tomorrow thank you.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman.
So I guess the one I'm asking Mr
speaker and gentleman is.
I'm reading this legislation and
it doesn't look like we have a
delayed repeal one here right
we're looking at making this.
Permanent
is that correct Mr speaker
German.
Speaker gentle man yes that's
for.
The gentleman I would support
that based off of the data here
we have on the drawing fund
balances.
but Mr speaker and gentleman I
just wanted to.
Help us maybe perhaps understand
that when we have.
budgets are clearly outside of.
What would be
The trend the
The fiscally wives range for
spending we always end up coming
back and it always ends up
impacting public schools.
And in this case impact was not
as great as
a prior downturn that I was here
for where we actually swept
balances cash balances from
every school district.
But here again we see a case
where
we had to stop what I think was
a.
A great idea of getting some
extra funds to schools so we can
take further maintenance so I
just want to.
Of.
Reiterate that lesson and hope
that we we learned that lesson
that when we are.
Disciplined with our spending
improving with our spending New
Mexico wins and when we're not
it's often our children that
suffer so Mister speaker and
gentleman I
very much appreciate the
opportunity to to talk about
this bill and I am happy to
support and I thank you Mr
speaker for the time.
The gentleman Chavis and
Lincoln.
Thank you Mr speaker to the
gentleman from Bernalillo county
yield.
Speaker I yield to the gentle.
Thank you Mr speaker
the gentleman this is why
outside of my area of expertise
but there's two questions that I
have and the first one I notice
said that but charter schools
get to count their enrollment
and in the formula and.
I have recently understood that
there may be two different types
of charter schools ones
chartered by the
The school district and the
other might be state charter to
my question is Mr Chairman
gentleman through the state
chartered.
Charter schools get to
participate in this.
Speaker gentleman yes.
Mr speaker and gentleman does
does that in any way a fact the
change the distribution or or
affect the distribution that
would otherwise go to the other
schools.
Speaker and and gentlemen
it does of the bill accounts for
that.
Mr speaker and gentleman one
issue that's arisen in my
community is
It seems that there is maybe
have
some differential treatment with
respect to the ability of some
of those schools to secure
bonding money and I don't quite
understand it but I hope there's
nothing in this legislation that
would
either further restrict that
ability or to keep them from
from accessing money through
I think it's a.
General revenue bonds that are
issued about every two years do
you know of anything in this
legislation that would deal with
that issue.
Mr speaker and gentleman it
certainly wouldn't negatively
affect any four year it stated.
Mr speaker and gentleman thank
you those are all the questions
I have thank you.
The gentleman from Coface curry
Harding where was it a semi on
you.
Thank you Mr speaker the
gentleman yield.
This year I yield to the gentle.
Mr speaker German the the this
this is for schools that have a
mill levy is that true.
The speaker gentleman Mr.
Mr speaker gentleman this
increases the state Madeleine
school collects the mill levy
and it goes to the state come
back to the school this
increases the state match is
that true.
Speaker and gentleman yes it is.
So many years of us for the
school board the says B. R. SB
nine money is what we used to
fix the roof fixed the door keep
the school up and running is
that is that what most schools
do.
Mr speaker and gentleman I
secretary.
So whenever the cost to fix the
screen.
Is the.
Becomes more than.
Sixty percent of the value of
building in the school that's
one way to get on the list to be
considered if you get a new
school is that true.
Mr speaker and gentleman I I
think that seems accurate ending
the percentage I'm not too sure
but it's scenes in that
ballpark.
So Mister speaker gentleman.
The last time this bill came
around I carried it in the in
the house of along with me Mr
the Senate in the.
the.
The the by the by the end of by
the end of the session I kinda
had the formula down but it's a
it's a little bit complicated
complicated formula if you the
if that's not what you do for a
living and so I.
Appreciate you caring at this
time it is a good bill will help
our schools of.
You know the real the reason
that got called back is the
reason a lot of other things got
a call back we just a comment
and we had an enormous drop and
get all and gas prices probably.
It with the little.
Little more steady nerves we
probably would have to write it
anyway but how free should you
bring it back and I think it'll
be a good help to our school
thank you Mr speaker the no
further debate gentleman the
clothes.

house bill one nineteen is
passed the house.
NexoBrid item fourteen generated
Bernalillo Representative
Garrett are you ready on that
item yes I am Mr speaker would
you give me to that point the
record reflect election
necessary for placing House Bill
seventy three as amended on
final passage is been taken the
gentlelady to explain it all.
House bill seventy three as
amended is the educational
retirees returning to work is a
tri partisan book.
The bill led by leader Anderson
Representative Ryan Lee
Representative Figueroa and
myself it creates a new return
to work program for retirees
receiving pension benefits from
the E. R. B. E. currently an
educator wishes to return to
work full time has to set out
for a full year before retiring
that retiree can work for as
many years as they choose this
bill allows a retiree to return
to work after ninety days
however they have they can only
return for thirty six months
consecutive or non consecutive
monthly employment or European
player has to pay into the R. B.
fund the employee does not
accrue any additional work
credits and they continue to
receive their ERP tension the
bottom line is executive
director David Archuleta of the
New Mexico educator.
Retirement board says is that it
has no fiscal impact and it
helps our students and with that
I stand for questions see no
debate gentle lady to close.
Right now I'm just getting.
Generally the health I wish they
weren't.
The gentle lady from granted all
going this year.
Percent down are you there.
Okay gentleman from let's see a
Representative box.
Thank you Mr chairman I with the
gentle lady please hold.
Yes Mr speaker I yield to the
gentleman from Valencia County.
I apologize Mister speaker.
Thanks for the I have the four
sided sentencing committee so I
just want to talk about some of
the highlights of this bill to
kind of be how this could change
a little bit
It does we I did say that.
In a bill that's attempting to
get to the more than one
thousand classrooms filled with
the holy qualified effective
teachers something that we need
to do if the one question that I
brought up about.
Is really about as far as these
folks are coming back to the
classroom as far as the
eligibility for the budget as
far as when we talked about it
one of the things is because
this on top of the pandemic.
Was actually the I did when we
the post had to retire before
June twentieth I'm sorry June
thirtieth of twenty twenty.
Otherwise they have to work
until they're fifty five can you
explain that for me as far as
how the budget will affect this.
Mr speaker and.
Kind so then because of other
movies in that year be it won't
affect them and I'm sorry my
expert witness David Archuleta
is no longer with us.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady.
Another question the.
Want to talk about is the.
We actually coming back to work
is for the licensure to.
One of the one of the challenges
as someone who's recently
retired.
They may be they may have a full
license in place but if they
have retired over number of
years.
It is our process and there's
far as will they be given an
alternative licensure how the
process works.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
a separate issue that we're
working on with PED.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady at the and I'm not I
guess my just because I know
that there's others like as far
as waiver alternative licensure
so I across from tier I let my
license expired user agrees
provided for these folks that
are going to be coming back into
the classroom or is that
something is outside of this
scope Mr speaker and kind
gentleman that's outside the
scope this only refers to a
teachers returning after ninety
days.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
generally services as far as any
other specialized groups as far
as educational diagnostician is
speech wise with all to submit
school employees to they also
qualify under this current bill
yes Mr chairman kind gentleman
anybody who pays into the ERP
system and is eligible for this
bill.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
kindly gentlelady well my last
question is really is really
this as far as.
What drugs have actually signed
on and they have given in
support of this one one of the
things we've heard and other
other groups and what to bring
with the bills I know that's not
appropriate.
But that they had concerns about
the impact of the RB so how we
had other groups that have
signed on in support of this and
if so the kindly please let us
know for the good of what groups
those are.
Yes Mr speaker and kind
gentlemen every educational
group the superintendents the
educational leaders of the
union those individuals
the executive director of the R.
B. has said that it has no
fiscal impact in his the rest of
this quote was that it helps our
students so there's been
basically hundred percent
support.
thank you Mr speaker the judges
level my fitness is not a it's
not a trick okay.
unlike other built environment
level three teacher coming back
into I've set up for three years
and I'm coming back into the
profession in my record to start
a level one or two for what I
get my license as far that the
level at which I retired.
Mr speaker and gentleman you
reenter wherever you left so I'm
a level three tier if I return
to work next week I returned as
a level three tier.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
generally.
Further debate the gentleman
from Sandoval Representative
Harper.
Thank you Mr speaker does the.
Lady from Bernalillo healed I
guess Mr speaker I yield to the
kinds element from my neighbor
to the north just settle that Mr
speaker gentle I think you it's
a great to have a little
conversation with you so early
on a Saturday morning Mr jelly I
I do have several questions so I
can make sure I understand this
correctly
Mr speaker Julie I'm I'm since
the Senate's bill but I'm also a
little surprised if I'm just
honest because we've had bills
similar to this over the years
that I've been here and usually
the groups that you just
mentioned are adamantly opposed
and so it was bitterly you
somehow got the secret sauce
Mr speaker gentle lady I'm gonna
ask you both agree and so that
you know we can replicate the
secret sauce if that's alright.
Some speaker gentle lady this is
a essentially a return to work
bill that's limited to Education
at this time news is that
correct Mr jelly Mr speaker and
kind gentleman this only applies
to people that pay into the ER
bi Fund.
So Mister generally does this
includes an higher ed or or.
Q. what what we know pays into
the ERP I.
Mr speaker and gentleman
everybody hired in the public
education system which includes
charter schools districts they
pay into it custodians clerks
and according to secretary
Rodriguez of higher education
there are certain groups within
higher education that also pay
into the ERP and she they also
supported Mr speaker and gentle
lady thank you for that so not
everyone in higher ed pays into
it but there are some.
okay the thank you that's that's
helpful how to understand the
scope here speaker and
generally.
Right and then the structure
that was laid out here.
One can retire.
And then what is the period
since that to have to wait I
think there's like an IRS like
term of arts it is escaping me
it's like a.
Mr speaker and gentleman it's
ninety days the I. R. S. in
October twenty twenty one issued
a statement noting that re
hiring a retiree due to
unforeseen circumstances was not
prohibited
and they use the school district
is an example of using an
employer from COVID.
spirituality thank you and yes
the the term of art I was
looking for is lock out period
they call it speaker and
gentleman yeah and I want to
talk a little bit about some of
those ninety days and I think
you're I think you're exactly
right to.
we we may fall into with as many
days I think we fall into a
great period but I think based
off of your explanation I think
we're okay but speaker and and
gentlelady my understanding is
that the IRS.
they have regulations that
generally.
prohibited to pension plans for
making payments
to workers who have not retired
really and so you have to have
this they call the a way out
period.
And and usually it's.
I mean kind of the shortest you
see is ninety days usually it's
like a year so Mr speaker and
Julie to talk about how you
landed on that ninety days.
Mr speaker and and kind children
and this is a national crisis
and I are just
Is that you don't have to wait
till Monday some districts
actually to stay out like thirty
days so it is not a problem with
the IRS so
speaker gentle lady I I think
you're right but I I don't think
it's based off of the days I
think it's because of the the
crisis that you're talking about
my understanding is that the
IRS
has you know basically you know
kind of signal that
likely to target pension plans
if it's a meeting some critical
unforeseen staffing shortage
right
Mr delay but there are
protections for
for example of where I work.
I can just retire and then come
back the next day there's a a
long period that has to go
through and madam speaker
generally.
When we've heard bills like this
in the past that's one of the
main reasons that we hear from
folks like to your B. or para
who the propose and say well
you're gonna be true draining
this fund and not making.
It's into it or perhaps you are
making payments but it still is
going to be a damage to the fund
so much bigger duly I center
okay here with iris because this
is a critical one for seen
staffing shortage.
Can you talk to the.
Next about why you're being is
supportive and why they say this
isn't to get a.
The the fund.
Mr chair and kind a gentleman
here B. hasn't taken an official
position because they haven't
met to discuss it however David
Archuleta who was formerly head
of the read the hell's retiree
Fund in a month ago became head
of the R. B. study did and said
quote it has no fiscal impact
because the retirees concerned
continue to pay into a fund
without accruing any extra years
credit and the employer the E.
R. B. employer also pays into
it.
Mr speaker and gentle lady thank
you for that and that I have
seen some prior kind of back to
work bills that that that of the
Mr gently and and when we were
in the mass it seems like that
when I heard the fund but we
heard otherwise so Mister
Julian.
I'm I'm pleased to hear that
someone from the mass and and
this looks good so much
spiritually.
I guess the the the question
that leads into is the in the
middle making payment into the
fund the employers making
payments to the fund.
What is that amounts going to be
when they come back do they come
back making as much as they did
before and is it a percentage or
are they gonna come back at a
lower level and is that a
percentage and how to that
calculus work.
Mr speaker and gentleman they
come back at the level where
there we hired at so if I
returned what let's say that I
retired US seventy days ago at a
level three tier I would come
back at the same salary as long
as I got that level three
teacher position and wanted it.
I was available.
Mr generally that that sounds
like a great deal right I've
I've seen some versions of
legislation like this we come at
lower Mr Jody this.
This would probably be a great
encouragement and for someone
who is a retirement age to go
ahead and retire.
And then they'll be drawing
pension still paying it but
essentially making their same
salary and pension.
spiritually I think that's a
great encouragement a great
motivation and maybe they'll get
some of our retired teachers who
are very tired
but maybe still have some some
more to give to come back Mr
usually do do you agree with
that or what your thoughts on
that Mr speaker and gentleman we
have another lovely thing
happening that's coming to the
house and that's a higher
teacher salaries so many people
who might a retired will not be
tired.
Mr jelly yeah I think that's a
great thing so hopefully we have
a couple good reasons for
teachers to not not to retire at
least the when they're
immediately able Senator
generally fall my understanding
is in this bill as well.
It says to be eligible.
They cannot render services or
how I guess that means teach.
For more than thirty six
consecutive months or non
consecutive months can you
explain to me what that means
and why we chose those that
three year time frame.
Mr chair and a kind gentleman we
chose to thirty six months
because if somebody wants to
come back for another twenty
years they do set out for a year
so this is for someone
especially in light of the
horrendous shortage we have
we're lacking almost five
hundred eighty As for lacking
like over a thousand teachers it
may
bring people back to thirty six
months consecutive or non
consecutive could mean that a
retired teacher might come back
let's say to teach K. five plus
the summer it just gives
options.
spiritually for low thank you
yeah that makes sense right if I
teachers not teaching full time
throughout the year you're
basically saying we're we're
gonna limit This this a special
benefit to three calendar years
I see you nodding so okay that
makes sense but speaker and
and generally do we.
To reset the.
This crisis will be done in
three years.
For white white would not what
do not do five or seven.
Mr speaker and gentleman this is
the retiree doing that period of
time.
We chose three years because of
special benefits.
Mr jelly that's that's for
enough and then did I understand
the rights of.
the first way operate is ninety
days and then three years.
But then there's another half.
Areas where they have to wait
for I I believe you said one
year and then they can go for
another three is that correct or
am I missing misunderstanding.
Mr speaker and kind gentlemen
you can come back now after
ninety days but you can only
work a quarter time and you
can't make more than fifty
thousand dollars this allows
somebody to come back after
ninety days to work full time
for that thirty six months
consecutive or non consecutive
period after that probably they
wouldn't come back again.
Frankly.
Mr speaker and gentle lady you
may be right
but there is still there and I
miss understood there's no
provision that says after these
three years you can wait for
another period of time and come
back for another three it's it's
three years and that's it Mr
speaker and kind gentlemen you
could set out a full year and
come back until you died.
Okay thank you of the speaker
and gentle lady that's.
That makes more sense though
that was my understanding so.
Ninety days three years.
And then you can sit out for one
year and come back for.
As long as you still have the
districts.
Speaker doing okay thank you for
that.
So I I guess.
Of.
Welcome my my last end of
questions here now that I
understand really well if the
secret sauce I know how you
market it.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
you know if we put something
together like this for for let's
say another critical need like
law enforcement.
You know what what were the.
For the methods that you used to
get the.
Communes and posed a member of
the E. R. B. to support this.
Mr speaker and gentleman the
unions in the past have not
supported.
Our return to work however we're
in a crisis situation and we
don't know how long it will last
for working on the teacher
pipeline of you can't just say
it'll take three years so that
they supported it.
the speaker gentle lady that
that makes sense
final throughout the state that
we have similar problems with
law enforcement they've been on.
Hello I would say that in a
crisis for many years even when
my neighbor city Albuquerque
tries to hire more we're still
at the same place we were years
ago
speaker gentle lady
I would sure hope that to.
You.
And your co sponsors for blazing
this trail for us
I hope that that is a trail that
we can also look to get other
people to understand the value
of and proceeded down it is
usually I really I just want to
say I really appreciate that you
did not make a return to work.
people kind of second class or
second tier.
Teachers that you allow them to
come back at the level they were
at this is really these.
I mean really these people are
at the.
at the end of a you know a long
successful career they have
maximum experience maximum
understanding.
And I think it's a disservice to
say we're only gonna let you
come back for half your salary.
Speaker gentle lady.
so I I really like that part of
the bill thank you for for doing
that.
so.
Speaker gentle lady.
I think.
I will a.
Over the for at this point but
thank you again for sharing your
secret sauce and I wish you much
success thank you Mr speaker
thank you Mr speaker I'm about
ready to get secret sauce and
Donald's kind gentleman.
The.
There's further debate the
gentleman from San Juan
Representative Montoya.
Thank you speaker gentle lady
from Bernalillo field.
Mr speaker I yield to the kind
gentleman from San Juan.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady
I just have a couple questions I
wish dress expert was on because
I'm not sure you're going to be
able to answer these but I've
always wondered.
as was mentioned by
Representative Harper the folks
have been against this for years
and I'm not exactly I don't
exactly understand.
Why I'm not exactly sure why
what's the difference between.
A
Once the mystery and a and and
by a teacher that.
Has completed and retired at the
time at work.
And then.
Mr speaker and and and gentle
gentle lady make a move to
another state.
And go and go to work there and
start a new retirement there
and.
State and draw from the
retirement and and vice versa Mr
speaker and and and gentle lady
where the they retire from
another state and then they move
to New Mexico and then get on
and get on the E. R. B. at that
point I'm not sure what the
differences what why can it be
that that person retires.
And then if they want to
continue to teaching.
That we don't just treat that
like a brand new person and
maybe start a new plan Mr
speaker and gentle lady Mr
speaker and gentleman that's out
of the scope of this field but
I'm happy to talk to you at
another time.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady I know I I'm just wondering
because I'm.
Discussed because of the the
stops and they go and it goes
and so maybe you can explain.
That what does the stop each
time what does that do and your
bill the speaker and gentle lady
Mr speaker and kind gentleman
and has nothing to do with this
bill this bill only pertains to
people working in the New Mexico
ERP system.
Speaker and enjoyable what I'm
asking is in your bill flies
there.
The ninety days and if they're
not taking it that drawing.
From the system what does it
matter if they just and go back
to work.
In.
Mr Chairman currently you have a
choice you can go back
currently you can go back after
ninety days but you can only
work.
Our time point two five and you
can't make more than fifteen
thousand dollars
for the stay out for a full year
and can go back as long as you
want this bill gives a new
option that somebody can go back
full time excuse me they can go
back full time after ninety days
without waiting a year but
they're limited to the thirty
six months.
Some speaker and and gentle lady
at I'm just wanting class what
is the difference I'm not sure
if they're not.
taking an additional additional
of money from E. R. B. I'm not
sure what it matters why why
could they just not go back to
work.
And work full time.
Mr chairman and kind gentleman
iris does requires some break.
And so this is the way we did
it.
Thank you Mr speaker and gently
I by guess I'm interested in
finding out the answers to those
questions I'd and it would be
nice if you're.
If you're if we still had your
expert but I understand Mr
chairman and gentlemen I'll give
you Mr chill of cellphone.
Thank you Mr speaker and and
gentle lady I think that would
be helpful because as a as
Representative Strickler Harper
was mentioning does appear that
somehow you crack the code I'm
not sure why that's the code.
control the code can F. confuses
me I'm not sure why that worked
in and other options didn't
I I do understand the IRS that's
out of our hands but
higher still and and having a
very hard time understanding
why.
but we couldn't just.
Allow an individual to start
over again it's it's I've I've
not figured this out Mr speaker
and gentle lady in E. R. B. I
have not.
Come to any sort of a good
answer that I understand I'm
sure there's an answer and I I
just don't understand it it's
been explained a couple of times
I don't see how it hurts the
fund I don't see
Mr speaker gentle lady I don't
see how it makes any difference
if it's someone who is here
retires here and starts again
versus somebody who retires and
other state and starts.
I I it does not make any sense
to me whatsoever but I
appreciate you
taking my questions I hope at
some point we can get a good
answer to that so thank you the
speaker and gentle lady.
There is for the debate the
gentle lady from grant they'll
go and share a Representative
Dow thank you Mr speaker of the
gentle lady okay.
Yes Mr speaker and kind lady I
yield thank you Mr speaker and
gentle lady and I hi I'm I rise
in support of the bill I'm I'm
very excited that this is
happening
voted for in committee and I'm
gonna vote for it again and Mr
speaker and gentle lady you
mentioned that we are short five
hundred educational assistance
and over thousand teachers
Mr speaker and gentle lady yet
in this year's budget we're
expanding the number pre K.
classrooms is that correct.
Mr chair Mr speaker and kind
lady that's my understanding I
think you're probably more
plugged into it exactly than I
am at this point and Mr speaker
gentle lady I asked that because
the teacher child ratio in our
New Mexico pre K. classrooms is
one teacher for ten children and
one of the greatest indicators
that high quality only high
quality early childhood produces
educational and manages for
children and yet we are having
to give waivers now even to the
existing folks that are in the
pre K. classrooms and even
knowing this and even knowing
that the National Guard to
school is deployed in the
classrooms we're still expanding
New Mexico pre K. and really
we're creating part of this
problem
Mr speaker and gentle lady we're
also increasing the eligibility
to have access to free ECECD the
equivalent of that in the
private setting
we're is before starting with
Richardson the highest was
around ten percent of poverty
and oil and gas to go down and
go to a hundred hundred fifty
percent of poverty now we've
raised it up and we're bragging
about having a free universal
pre K. were eligibility goes
over a hundred forty percent of
poverty creating.
People and rolling their
families into classrooms with
the work force and we're we
deploy the National Guard to
early childhood programs and yet
we're expanding the program.
and and I heard you mention.
Mr speaker and gentle lady that
we're expanding K. five plus and
these retired teachers I thought
that that one of it is do we
make some flexibility in K. five
plus that doesn't have to be the
home room teacher.
Mr speaker your questions are
with out of the scope of this
bill.
Mr speaker intentionally you
mentioned that because of the
scope of the bill that retired
teachers to come back in working
K. five plus and I'm wondering
if you said in the summer they
might connect working K. five
plus the summer and I will only
because you brought up anything
are they allowed to work in just
the summer because I thought K.
five plus that we require you to
be the same homeroom teacher and
that they had to.
It did we give so I'm just
wondering.
Mr speaker and kind lady I gave
that as an example of where a
person might not work thirty six
consecutive months it's an
example thank you Mr speaker and
gentle lady because I I think
that would be a great thing if
we could do that I thought that
we have required that the home
room teacher remain the K. five
plus teacher as as an example
that this is in essence an
extension of the school year but
it but it it it has in some
places because people to go
ahead retiring there at twenty
years and so the I hope the
private pay raises will bring
them back and madam speaker and
gentle lady we also are
expanding community schools and
community schools require
professionals at when we have
agencies so I you know I one of
the reasons that I am really
interested in supporting this
bill is because I am hearing
from folks all across the state
for example in my district of
Hidalgo people are leaving their
their their work they're
choosing to work in Duncan
public schools and Duncan
Arizona where they the children
are advanced that's whether
taking their children and where
the teachers are announced in
southeast New Mexico they're
going to Texas and where they do
not have to wear a mask and
their children do not have to
wear a mask in northern New
Mexico they're choosing to work
in Colorado where they do not
have to wear a mask and the
children do not have to wear a
mask and so I am glad that we're
addressing this we're letting
people come back I'm glad that
we're giving the pay raises of
supporting those things but
we're creating some of the
crisis we're creating a
workforce shortage.
And so it's it's it.
There is a quality of life there
is respect for the profession
there's respect for individuals
that also has to be considered
when we're making these
decisions and Mr speaker and
gentle lady I I love.
I serve with you and education I
know how much you care about
educators and I I appreciate the
sponsors of this bill and why
we're bringing it forward that
is really important for us to
consider other reasons why
people are choosing to retire
centers are eligible why they're
not returning to work and why
these pay raises might not solve
the problem that we're looking
for but this is another piece
this is another piece of the
puzzle and we talked about in
committee why right now
emergency clause Mr speaker and
gentle lady could you explain
why there's no emergency clause.
No wasn't necessary because this
follows the retirees ninety days
thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady you know but but isn't it
true that if we put on if that
if we put in a emergency clause
that the people who retired in
the school year of twenty twenty
one could return as early as
April and may as opposed to
returning and in August thinking
about going to classroom now
could prompt them to stay well
if there is a closed Arizona
Colorado Texas they could be
looking for a job out of state
and maybe not come back.
Mr chairman and gentle lady as
soon as the bill is passed in
the governor signs it anybody
who's already been retired
ninety days could be eligible.
So Mr speaker and gentle lady
who's not eligible as soon as
the governor signs the bill.
Mr chair and kind lady of people
that haven't retired ninety days
would not be eligible.
Mr speaker and gentle lady so
someone who retired in December
is not eligible.
They would be eligible Mr
speaker and kind lady because
that would be past ninety days.
Mr speaker and gentle lady but
isn't that what the emergency
clause would do and without
explain to me why an emergency
clause doesn't accomplish that
in the bill does now.
Mr chair are excuse me Mister
speaker and kind lady.
We when we look at the calendar
we made the decision that it
wasn't necessary.
Mr speaker and gentle lady don't
the bills that we pass in the
governor signs without emergency
clause go into effect July
first.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
understand they go into effect I
think it's ninety days after she
signs them.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
thank you gentle lady.
So
Do you know how many people have
retired in the last ninety days.
Mr speaker and kind lady no I
don't.
Thank you Mr speaker and and
thank you gentle lady.
And do you believe that thirty
six months is enough for us to
recover from the educator
shortage are facing.
Mr speaker and kind lady other
people sit out a year and come
back and we're working on the
teacher pipeline.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
Julie and you are and I I really
appreciate that I really really
like the the grow your own
program
and hope that some day there
will the the expansion to
include early childhood
educators outside of the school
system.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
