in our house and state

thought that we were going to
have a committee substitute
heading to Judiciary for the
bill is just been reported out
by state government we are at
this point we're not expecting
that substitute and so we will
meet to this afternoon just
begin the discussion of house
bill eight in House Judiciary at
approximately three PM after the
democratic caucus.
Every single gentle lady from
McKinley as well and what we
will be and Mr speaker three of
seven.
It depends is a Charlie
forgiving someone is is your
committee meeting this afternoon
Mister speaker house
appropriations and finance
committee will not be meeting
this afternoon okay so we can
meet.
Mr speaker so much Mr speaker.
We have an office as well but
three oh seven I believe is the
room that house Republicans
three of the three online sorry
the speaker of the Nelson is
Republicans will meeting in
leadership office immediately
following the end of this
session or this recess of the
session speaker
I'd like to take a point of
personal privilege.
State your point thank you Mr
speaker.
So it was just mentioned by the
chair of judiciary that not
expecting.
Change to house bill eight
however.
I do want to talk about the
information that we received on
the side about what house bill
eight is that what the change
would potentially would be.
Speaker I would we like to talk
about that and that's what's
gonna be my point.
Mr speaker.
The discussion around the
changes potential changes to
house bill eight.
Our because apparently the wrong
kind of Hispanic holds that
seat.
Mr speaker and and and members.
That districts have sixty three
that is of going to be a topic
of discussion.
Is has been identified years ago
as a Hispanic community of
interest.
And potentially to be protected
and and watched.
And Mister speaker.
Ten years ago during
redistricting.
the legislature a Democrat
controlled both house and Senate
past.
Redistricting bill which was
vetoed by then governor Martinez
then went to the courts.
And the courts redrew the maps.
And one major that map.
House district sixty three.
Once again a community of
interest.
The courts drawn out a fifty
seven percent.
Hispanic.
Of voting age population.
Current house bill eight Mr
speaker has a fifty nine percent
Hispanic adults voting
population.
What's interesting is it the
the.
From performance measures.
That districts.
Increased two point one percent
actually in Hispanic voting age
population.
Incidentally it moved up almost
five percent four point nine
percent.
In Republican performance.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
And ladies.
The last several years the topic
has been about institutional
racism.
And.
Institutional racism.
The way I understand it is plan
institutions act in a certain
way.
Due to
In a way that potentially harms.
Minority voters.
And citizens.
Speaker.
It's interesting to me is.
A very ation change in Hispanic
population.
In performance and actual
performance legislation cycle.
Is a ten point one increase to
the Hispanic population.
The voting age.
Simultaneously almost a five
percent increase to Republican
performance.
And as I've been stating over
and over and over.
Conservative Hispanics.
For moderate Hispanics.
Somehow have second class
citizens.
The whole Hispanic court.
Somehow.
Unless it is a progressive.
Democrat Hispanic.
That that that Hispanics cannot
be properly represented by a
Hispanic.
As well as around and I see.
Representative Zamora who
represents house district three
Benjamin systemic.
Talking about is.
Adding a bunch of Hispanic.
Democrat performing precincts.
To house bill eight.
Surely not because it's not
Hispanic enough four of the
Hispanics to be able to have
their voice heard as a matter of
fact their voices being heard
more by linking the Democrat
party becoming in that district
particularly.
Other independents or
Republicans if you look at the
numbers of house of house
district sixty three.
The Hispanics.
Are moving on from the Democrat
party.
If people look at what happened
in Texas.
And the mass exodus of
Hispanics.
To roll for the for the
Republican or to.
Council.
Can walk away from the Democrat
party.
That is happening for one
reason.
That's because.
Conservative for moderate views.
Among Hispanics and Hispanic
legislators in particular are
not tolerated.
And to point that out I just
have to look at a list of four
names here former colleagues of
course with years and years of
legislative service within their
community.
That have been targeted and
removed by progressives.
Deborah della and at the time
that she was removed she was a
senior member of this body.
Of this house chamber called
Trujillo.
Name for you.
Institutional self Clemente
Sanchez Senator had been removed
because she was not spending
enough.
And our place today prior to
what is happening with house
with the house district sixty
three.
We're seeing it happen with
house district forty four with
our current.
Longest serving member were also
happens to be.
A long serving Republican.
Minority member of this chamber.
Mr speaker.
And and Democrat party members.
My family was Democrat.
My family almost entirely has
left the Democrat party over one
reason.
The views and concerns that we
have had.
As minority voters.
Taxpayers.
Community members.
Churchgoers.
Our views are no longer welcome.
And the Democrat party among the
progressive.
Group that once controlled.
Not only in Mexico but it's
nationwide.
That is why you're seeing I was
as I was trying to see what this
would do to house to house
district sixty three the
proposed changes I looked at how
dramatically Democrat
registration has dropped in
sixty three so far.
number one I would love to say
that the Republicans are the
number one beneficiary of this
but
over almost eleven percent.
Of that reduction has gone to a
to become the climb the state or
independent.
But almost five percent to the
Republican Party what's
happening is more more more and
management interesting to be
over the last several sessions
as I have argued.
That Hispanics.
Just need a fair chance.
We don't need Hispanics
minorities don't the cell on the
scale to make it more fair just
just for things are fair.
So that all of us with our god
given talents can go as far as
those god given talents will
take us.
Mr speaker knows a different
word the qualities Authority
more equity welcome.
That was much harder that's much
harder you have a somebody who
has the skill and ability
baseline test and somebody else
who doesn't have those skills
it's hard to get everybody
there.
But the quality and this is what
my parents taught me.
Is that a quality is the
opportunity.
To become everything that I can
withdraw my abilities and not to
be hindered that's it.
But I was also taught Mr
speaker.
That.
Ability and certain things that
may work in your favor.
He has those and everybody has
things that work against them.
Can you just verify has a failed
to climb everybody has something
to overcome.
Mr speaker.
Here I seen.
Spandex in the state.
Go from everyone being a hapless
victim to now some Hispanics.
And if you're in the future the
the
What's going to be taught in
school.
What time is that the culture of
the Hispanics in the state of
New Mexico are now.
Going to be demonized.
At home and and I don't know
what the matrix is going to be I
don't know if it's going to be
Mr speaker skin tone.
And I don't know if that's going
to be skin tone in the summer
skin tone in the winter or who's
going to go to attending those
and who's not if they're if
they're under age girl they can
go to attending both anymore.
But Mr speaker.
I don't know if it's if if
there's going to be a chart like
when you go to the dentist.
And there's a
the the color matching of your
teeth maybe there's gonna be
some.
Something that we're going to
determine that you're right to
be Hispanic or equipment how
many generations your family has
been in the state.
To post when the content comes
to doors were here.
But this.
Whatever problems have been
going on nationwide have not
been in the state.
The problems that happen in the
state years and years ago the
majority of those problems have
have what.
What we talk about.
Our different cultures and how
we're still United.
For trying to do now is divide.
And.
Mr speaker.
In looking at the changes.
That may be proposed.
It appears not only to maybe
help.
Democrats.
House district sixty three.
It appears that to some degree.
Intended to hurt another member
or those for those a.
Those precincts we pulled out
of.
Mr speaker.
I don't believe we should be
doing that in this body.
And Mister speaker.
The idea that.
We're going to leave house
district.
House district.
The districts alone and then
maybe we can have some changes
in between that we could do that
and now Mr speaker we're talking
about changing something and I
believe the specifically for
political advantage and and and
somehow we're using the Civil
Rights Act fifty nine percent
Hispanic district already.
To try to somehow say that that
is not enough and Mister
speaker.
Ten years ago the Supreme Court
said.
They set that standard the New
Mexico Supreme Court set that
standard fifty seven percent.
House bill eight goes to fifty
nine percent so Mister speaker I
believe this is a specious
argument intended just to target
a a Hispanic conservative.
Somehow doesn't fit the bill of
Hispanic.
And to me Mr speaker and I I
believe I stated this before
that is very offensive.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Which is
all the stuff used to take a
little bit of the progress of
the chairs to point out that the
comments that you've been
making.
About the map content house bill
eight we're not the party you're
referring to were not drawn or
designed.
By any member of this
legislature.
Democrat or Republican the
critique that you're offering
valid or not.
Should be directed at the
citizens redistricting committee
which voted on and passed those
lines and submitted into us for
consideration.
So I just wanna make it real
clear for anyone who might be in
the gallery listening at home
well it appears that you're
offering criticism two members
of the house I let you go on
with the debate because I didn't
feel the your.
In your comments I didn't feel
you were directing them at a
member of this body had you been
a of course would have reminded
you that we don't question
motives or cast aspersions on
members of the house.
But I think it's very clear and
as one point out to me missing
the issues with the gentle lady
from Santa issues with.
Senator move the district I I I
never like to say.
So and so's district going to
see the district to
Representative Zamora
representative because it
doesn't want him anymore than
district forty seven belongs to
me the districts we represent
our hours this year C. is one
who provided a strong allies
you're talking about so I want
to make sure thanks you not just
your degree with the you're not
casting aspersions are
questioning motives of any
member of this legislature the
generally a Representative
Martinez thank you Mr speaker in
two million in one region until
twelve one PM hello second order

people of New Mexico.
And for my people not outside
normal medical cases in New
Mexico just look at stop us on
the on the.
An in house floor.
Of the state of New Mexico what
what's happening is that.
We are being suppressed.
By the political party.
The major political parties to
educate ourselves.
That you can be a Republican has
elected minority in the state of
New Mexico.
And stand up for your rights.
I am not a monster.
Or I'm not a bad person.
Because I am a Republican J.
Connell there's nothing wrong
with that.
And the people of the state of
New Mexico.
Can look at the Republican
Party.
As a minority.
His final in the state.
And understand.
What the different parties mean
and that's what I want to do for
my people in the state of New
Mexico is an educator the
differences and what we stand

People need to wake up as to
what the difference is and
that's why stand here with the
Republican Party to make a
difference and educate our
people thank quit being
suppressed thankfully being
pushed around and that's why I'm
being targeted and that's why
this district is being targeted.
Because I stand for somebody
that can educate the people in
the state of New Mexico as to
what we stand for.
The gentle lady from Rio Arriba
Santa Fe and Taos Representative
Herrera D. wish to speak point
of prince and princess speaking
state your point.
Mr speaker I would like to.
Like everybody to understand
that Hispanic women ran against
a democratic Hispanic women
against democratic Hispanic
women in district forty one I
felt.
I feel that with my.
Yes
Predecessor
like how she voted was really
not have the district felt and I
took on a twenty five year
income that and I said I don't
think this is how the people in
my district Phil.
And I I would like I'd like the
representative from district
sixty three to also know my
father was a Hispanic Republican
his daughter as it has been a
Democrat I helped start the
commission has been a conference
in in in Congress I was a second
director of that caucus under it
wasn't due to during that time
within six is that Congress is
to about eighteen I mean I lived
in an era when that Hispanic
population was come to their own
political.
I guess accu men in this country
is a very exciting time but what
I want to say.
Is that we all represent
districts and the way the people
voted the way the people vote
and how they determine who the
representative this is they
determine that but how you stand
on the issues and monitor your
issues and your your decisions
on the issues might work for the
people of the of your district
things certainly don't look for
the people of my district and
that's why then that's I am Mr
speaker
I ran for the democratic caucus.
We needed a voice here that
Representative have the
Democrats in district forty one
really felt analytical that
that's that's my point.
And and trying to say that you
lost to Democrat in Los to
Hispanic when you came to
Hispanic at the same time I
don't think there was any loss
it was just a change it was just
a change of philosophy thank you
Mr speaker.
Okay.
