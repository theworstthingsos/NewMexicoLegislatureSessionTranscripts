legislation then personalize the
bill I also when I was a in the
in the energy committee either I
introduce the first hydrogen
fuel cell piece of legislation
ever in the state you know and
and it had Republican support.
It was kind of a unique
the initiative we had a solar
photovoltaic that basically fed
energy to and electrolysis
process that separated the
hydrogen from the oxygen we then
move that hydrogen into a fuel
cell and then we Howard a little
more a little motor I got a car
a little model car motor with
the with the fuel cell that we
reject it from that electrolysis
process and
and you know Mr chair
and then we set up that project
on the state forest property and
you know the Pecos
using that simple and that and I
could put all that stuff that
little also a follow up to a
little panel about the size of
a.
Smaller than a dollar bill that
electrolysis process we just
like cuddle tank of water with a
little straw on it that
separated the high jump from the
oxygen and then the little fuel
cell where we ran the hydrogen
into the department of motor we
could all sit in a shoe box.

The minore minority analyst is.
Assigning earlier that year
recognize is Representative
chairman McLean Tom Bearden is
fill again for the minority
energy analyst Tom beard.
Okay in I think I don't see him
listed on the.
Or the attendees I don't think
he got an invite so we'll get
that straightened out okay.
What's more the reason we're.
Doing this
It will get August needs it make
sure you connect with them.
And you know normally in the.
In the committee yeah we would
have attendance and the that
maybe even the sergeant but I
guess we're doing it but this
year so I just want to go over a
few things up for the committee
it's a short session so not only
are we limited on time
But typically as recession
because of our subject matter
jurisdiction we're not all that
busy our subject matter
jurisdiction isn't automatically
germane us so that kids can come
for us to get in on either a
message from the governor or
maybe something with
appropriation.
That being said we actually
already have I built indicate.
I'm cert expecting but overall a
light load in yet some of the
bills we we will share I think
you're really big bills
complicated bills and bills that
the public here is interested
in.
So I'm expecting a lot of the
public participation.
I I am expecting to meet on
Saturday I haven't confirmed
that yet I still to work out the
details
the first bill that was referred
to us as house bill six which is
I think one of the bills that
We have a lot of interest in.
I'm not sure if the sponsor that
bill is going to be ready on
Saturday and if he's not it's
possible we will do the other
for in the queue which are
Some point of bills but more
discreet in their subject
matter.
and then do you possibly do
house bill six on Tuesday in the
course there are other bills
that we're expecting to come our
way.
This is.
You know it with the knowledge
that people would probably
rather not meet on Saturday.
This evening we do what time
would you all like to start.
After cartoons Mr chair.
Yes.
After cartoons Mr chair.
Representative Ortez you might
not be aware of this but
thirteen to twenty four seventy
states with you to.
They are for my kids.
Your line fine after nine or
nine eight.
Nine or after.
Nine this season some head
shaking okay.
I think it's nine nine or ten
was what I was thinking I'm
happy to start at nine.
And hopefully we can sort of a.
You know knock it out in the you
have are after the the student
do what else we need to do.
I'm.
We're also in you know in
addition to being.
Yes service subject matter
committee
we're often the first to be so
that's also part of my reason
you know what I don't want to
make a bill we.
It still has another committee
in the house and then to the
Senate so if it's going to
pastor committee of like to get
it on its way.
I'm.
That's really all I want to
cover does anyone have any
questions Representative
current.
Thank you Mr chair I do have a
question since I'm new to this
committee in terms of the bills
that will be hearing in
committee how do we know the
numbers of those bills and it
how do we access them is that up
to us the someone on the
committee who's assisting you
send it to us but please help me
to understand what the process
is.
That's a great question that you
know before we hear them on the
committee they will be put on
the agenda which appears on the
golden rod.
Yeah I
I A. up I last Augustine with
the sends out notices of the
committee to include of course
copy of the H. at so that's how
you will know what bills are
coming you can look on the
You can look on the website you
know there's a list of bills.
and when they update their
website that there's a little
code in a to show you the where
the bill has been referred.
so you can do it that way it's
kind of hard to do it that way I
I also meeting a reading list.
If you ever have any questions
just for internal tracking
purposes and then there's you
know with every bill there are
many analyses and agency
analyses F. I R. those should be
emailed out to you and there's
also last year they gave us
access to Citrix.
Which was sort of a file system
where you can
the access all that information
directly and that's something
that your legislative assistant
should be able to help help you
with and help get that set up.
In you know last year since we
were totally virtual yeah I've
always had my the legislative
system or committee assistant
prepare a package right so the
bill the F. I. R. now sees
I was in the roundhouse for them
to do that so I was using that
Citrix file
a lot in it was pretty it was
pretty stressful at work pretty
well
so we'll make sure Augustine
collects all that information in
posted with there will be a
house energy the Citrix file on
that.
Yes that might be one of the
things that we just we we got
into a.
Figure out how to work out the
because it's been a year and
we've also got.
The helpers and printing.
Yes it does thank you Mr chair
your is it turned and
Representative Ortez thank you
Mr chairman I am well aware of
the twenty four hour nature of
cartoons thank you have a
serious question for the
purposes of some of the members
on this do and for the public
can you let us know what the
list of the bills are that we
have coming to this committee.
For the next you know if sure
for Saturday.
So I.
The origin of this list are
using it to me
The bill is the numbers I don't
know the titles I don't have
thousand from the house bill
six.
House Bill Levin.
House Bill fourteen.
House bill thirty four.
And house bill thirty five.
The names of those bills.
Representative Ortez.
But you had your hand up and you
put down.
Question okay.
So so that's that's what we have
so far in like I said that the
I'm not sure if the house bill
six guys we're gonna be ready
yet so we'll find out later this
morning and we will of course if
we do meet on Saturday let
everyone know and that will be
published on the golden rod the
general attend that by Friday.
Any other questions from the
committee more from the staff
for that matter.
Okay well I guess you know I I
really appreciate everyone who
did attend today attending
and I ask the you know patients
because.
You don't do this stuff for a
year and it gets rusty and I
know you know in the past as
chair I mean this isn't
something I do every day I make
mistakes please bring them to my
attention I know I will correct
the of my Republican colleagues
that very good it the calling
states my attention passed and I
genuinely appreciate that
because you all do something
stupid like forget to take the
role or forget to go to the
audience
so we'll just sort of muddle
through and hopefully we'll get
it right.
and with that we are joined I'll
see you probably started we'll
let you know.
Thank you everyone.
Thank you.
