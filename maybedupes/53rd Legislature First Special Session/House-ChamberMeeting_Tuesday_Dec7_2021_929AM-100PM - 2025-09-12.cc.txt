Welcome to
good morning everyone my name is
Curtis I was a member of the
citizens redistricting committee
I'm gonna tell you a little bit
about the process that the
committee
used to get the maps that
eventually voted on and and the
that will be presenting to.
After the process will go
through the individual maps and
research and polling explained.
The districts to.
Tell.
I I want to start with the the
redistricting act was created in
fact of.
Had a.
The bipartisan.
Very important bipartisan basis
to it the members of the
committee were and were selected
as follows the honorable former
Chief Justice Edward L. Chavis
was our chair he was appointed
by the state of X. commission.
I was seeing was a pointed by
the house minority leader James
Townsend I was appointed by the
Senate president pro tem.
Stuart Webber Rattigan was
appointed by the state ethics
commission.
And specifically as a person and
party Soto a Democrat or
Republican.
What consensus was appointed by
the state ethics commission also
in the.
Member of a party that is not I
am Democrat or Republican.
And in the out of the Michael
Sanchez was part of us for the
house.
Preservers of Saito Senate
minority leader appointment
that I
going back to.
It is a critical importance that
you understand the way that the
committee operated was with
complete and total collegiality
politeness respect
voted unanimously and many times
of the processes that we were
going to institute we all
questioned the citizens that
came and had a specific
philosophy.
And that was that we were there
so only to find out of these
are.
And we presented maps to.
That was created solely by the
citizens of this state telling
the legislature of the districts
that they want to have.
All the committee members
biographies are on in in
re districting that or that
website.
extraordinary in uses current
technology and district we had
over two thousand citizens in
New Mexico participate in the
creation of maps in presenting
testimony.
we learned that while the
population is not significantly
grown in the state of New Mexico
it has shifted from requiring
changes in redistricting.
And learn to turn on we had over
twenty public meetings I all of
the public was invited to every
training that was done for us it
with the independent citizens
redistricting committee in
Arizona.
Met with the California
independent citizens
redistricting commission learned
the two things that were very
important that those independent
commissions maps from
challenged.
There is a in the United States
Supreme Court California in
California Supreme Court in the
system districting maps from
what we held.
The broad coalitions of people
that came to speak to us.
it was true brilliance of the
leaders of a native American.
black and African American Asian
and refugee populations.
To speak about voting in the
state to be heard.
The C. R. C. understood that the
law was the first ever
bipartisan to undertake
distracting from the state.
We understood as I know the
legislature does knighted states
in the New Mexico state
constitutional requirements of
for one person one vote.
And
and I think the important thing
that the committee itself wants
to make sure your stand.
Is that there are things in the
state needs to be addressed.
Past problems that the singer
seeing was able to.
and the simply by hearing from
people from different parts of
the state talk about how
their voices are silenced.
I know that.
Take a redistricting process
incredibly seriously the idea
that no judge of court should
have to in fact to me district
Mexico will be the concept that
has a.
Has not occurred for some time
now.
And it's our hope that with
these maps in the respect that
they have provided to you with
from a bipartisan committee.
That in fact you will.
See the work that the committee
itself is done.
And use that to the benefit of
the citizens that came to speak
to us.
We were.
Not
We were clearly not taking any
position based on politics did
not have partisan data.
had a very difficult job to do
in a very short period of time
in the census was late in coming
to us.
And so the last thing I want to
say before we go to the maps
themselves is that.
Well I know a lot of you are
familiar with find Sander of in
with his group research and
polling.
I don't know if everyone
understands ridiculous
dedication of that group has
shown to getting working with
people and its maps.
He worked seven days a week
overnight times for us to be
able to have the information to
share with the public so that
they can comment on it and so
with that I'd like to turn it
over to research a polling go
through the first House map that
we have to present.
I believe Michael sharp is going
to.
That particular charge.
The first house now.
It has a concept number on it
I understand you guys don't have
a copy all of you of the norms
report that was produced by the
committee but there is a formal
report so with that committees
Michael short for research and
polling.
and we have done this
presentation many times across
the state to the public.
And that is so let's start with
the first concept now.
Which I believe is titled in
Michael.
Thanks very much Mr speaker
members of the house.
And this Curtis of mines Michael
sharp with research and polling
and we're gonna go quickly or
let's quickly over concept to be
one that was adopted by the C.
or C.
just a little bit of background
in terms of the house.
Okay I'll try to get this closer
to this is better madam chair
would be possible for and remove
his mask only speaks.
But you can just hold them make
a close terminal that would
really help.
Okay.
Do you want to try to.
Sure.
So I can talk about concept the
ones is better.
Okay thank you.
Okay so in general one of the
population trends we have to
think about is that after the
census data was released that we
had a number population changes
throughout the state and that
affects how we go about drawing
the districts quickly highlight
them in the northwest part of
the state overall when you look
at the districts.
In that region that the house's
house districts one two three
four five six nine and sixty
five and sixty nine that overall
they were down by about fifty
fifty five percent in terms of
of the deviation so they ended
up on balance of not having
enough population to keep pace
with the rest of the state so
there's a lot of change that has
to happen in the northwest in
general districts will need to
expand.
On the other corner of the state
in southeastern New Mexico does
the opposite there's a lot of
growth in Eddy and Lea counties
over the past ten years and they
had a population growth that
exceeded the state and overall
as a region there about forty
five percent to pay so the
districts in the area generally
will need to lose some
population as a region and
generally shrink.
Rio Rancho less out of
Albuquerque's same with respect
to growth the Rio Rancho area
the west side also had about
fifty percent above the ideal
population as a group and so the
districts in the area especially
the ones that experienced a lot
of growth we need to strengthen
it and allow other districts to
come into the west side to take
up that populations.
Over the course of the C. R. C..
Process we heard a lot of
testimony regarding communities
of interest and the the the once
we heard I think most frequently
for a day in the south the
southern part of the state
temporal it's the there was
testimony to keep chaparral in a
single district not split
between two or more districts in
Grant County currently to six
thirty eight thirty nine split
Grant County and that this has
somebody was wells anyway to
keep Silvercity within a single
district.
With the in the Albuquerque area
the comment we heard was try to
use the Rio Grande as a common
down the between districts
trying not to cross the Rio
Grande north of I. forty so it's
okay across the south it
traditionally districts have
crossed their but try to keep
the the river a a boundary
between districts and also the
international district within
Albuquerque between some entail
Wyoming south Obama's roughly
the is currently split between
two districts and we heard some
testimony to try to keep that
part of the city into a single
district.
Additional testimony from the
second so ciation in the north
central part of the state was to
keep the districts similar to as
they are now to best represents
what the second cessation filled
with the interests of the
northwest part of the state.
and finally
we heard a lot of testimony
about the native American groups
wanting to preserve the six
native American districts that
you currently have with the New
Mexico.
And as of these six the American
districts ten years ago they are
all of us sixty two percent
adult native American and the
testimony we heard was to
maintain a six they've American
districts at roughly that same
level or above.
So that background we can go to
the one and that the one was was
presented or submitted to the C.
or C. through the district
website by the secular
Association and it was prepared
before the native American
working groups and of a nation
had submitted their northwest
region plants the state so I can
quickly go through the northwest
and able to kind of take a tour
around the state to see with the
districts look like.
So roughly in the northwestern
part of New Mexico the order of
the three of us Farmington Aztec
Bloomfield seeds districts one
two and three district four's
based ensure propped on says
this in Austin goes into
Farmington through currently in
Fruitland.
I just had districts I is in
state and nine they do split
Gallup was I going for Navajo
down the Churchill tala party
Gallup district I starts in New
Mexico and goes down to Gallup
and over to Crown Point.
And so there's a that's a four
five and nine that I just
mentioned to you the native
American districts district six
is grants district and including
the guna pama exceeding I'm
sorry requests for the Navajo
Nation and Partizani as well
help through through.
Sixty five sixty nine or both
but districts of stretching
roughly from the north west to
the southeast with sixty nine
having including including the
goon Act amma
Alamo to Hijli up through the
Chaco cultural and historical
park.
With sixty five.
Is the other native the fix the
American districts extending
south of Farmington from the
south of Farmington through our
Finno and also starts the
Colorado border and includes
dual say they create patties and
down around
a Cuba and then includes the
public the Sandoval county
including going through the town
of early to pick up Sandia
pueblo.
Yes the northwest part of the
state the every district is is
sixty percent or above adulting
American.
So based on testimony from the
second so the season we do keep
that the northern part of Mexico
was kept similar to what you
have today district forty
crossing the sum greater
Christo's and the city from the
Colorado border under tone down
through I can mount
into more and then across the
summer to crystallize into
Espanola forty to steer taas
rough roughly based district and
forty one frontier right down to
Espanola.
And seventy is Las Vegas down
into Torrance County.
There was some of population not
a lot of population growth in
the second statement that
secretary to compare area
Clayton so how sixty seven did
had have to expand and expand
itself into areas that sixty
four used to have so it's sixty
seven goes into Clovis as it has
population that sixty four used
to have been sixty four has to
expand has to go somewhere and
in concept the one sixty four
expand south into poor Tallas
that out too
press one to north eastern part
of Russell so it used to be a
close district in E. one it is a
Clovis part talus and down into
rules will take district sixty
three maintains as its current
shape it was created is as an
Hispanic district to number
decades ago and combines a
Hispanic communities of Clovis
and Santa Rosa two majority
Hispanic adult has been a
district.
So is sixty six expand south
Clovis well we're due to go into
I went into the the current
house sixty four go south of
the.
Clovis it goes into the existing
sixty six six population from
sixty six where to sixty six go
in this plan.
Sixty six helps take that excess
population from the southeast
and it extends into south into
Artesia and parts of Carlsbad
where it does not do that today
so that sixty six is one of the
districts that takes that access
populations on any in the and
puts it into a different
district to help solve that
excess population issue that we
have in the southeast part of
the state.
Sixty one fifty five and sixty
two are relatively same as what
you have sixty one is still a
southern Hobbs Lovington
District major adults spanning
fifty five goes from jail in
Eunice over to Carlsbad.
So as the population grew in the
southeast some of the areas
around Hobbs had to shrink a
little bit sixty six as I
mentioned help take the
population and fifty five is
going to the southeast
southeastern corner of the
state.
In Roswell area fifty nine is a
pretty compacts just to go into
Russell fifty eight is another
is in the adult the adult
Hispanic district from Rossell
south through lake Arthur in
dexter and Hagerman.
Alamogordo keeps fifty one as a
solid Alamogordo district fifty
four used to go for it it is to
start in the outskirts of
Alamogordo go into the Eddie
Carlsbad areas well because the
sixty six going and taking up
population fifty four has the
added by scooting further west
and north around Alamogordo up
into to the rasa so we can see
this population change as you
try to fix or or the dress one
situation and it causes a ripple
effect throughout the state we
we took care of the population
in southeastern part is stayed
with respect to the over pop and
that forced district fifty four
to to take a different shape
than what you have now and
extend further west.
In the Los crucis admitted that
districts are actually pretty
similar to what you have today
with some adjustments to account
for population change.
One of the major differences is
that house fifty three used to
go up towards Alamogordo and in
this plan it does not it stays
within it stays within Los
crucis.
Otherwise within the within the
auspices certain things are
pretty some of the biggest
change in the southwest part of
the state is that a house
thirteen thirty nine I used to
go in so for cities plus over
city in in this plan Silvercity
is now entirely within district
thirty nine.
So we heard that that input from
the stated that after ten point
was heard so Silvercity is
United that caused us to swap in
population between thirty and
thirty nine thirty eight no
longer goes towards Los crucis
instead sitting at and said
thirty eight that was until last
crucis and has parts of tier C..
And up into Sapporo.
And thirty eight does extend
from suits from tier C. down
through rating springs and into
Dona Ana County.
North of Los crucis and does go
on the other side on on on the
north side of highway seventy
out to one of Alamogordo to
stays on the north side of that
of that highly.
So forty nine a lost population
at thirty eight what happens the
forty nine ninety staff had
people so it extends a little
bit further north into Valencia
County so as part of real
communities it as much of the
Lynn are in order it billing
area around billion mostly Rio
communities.
And so it at a popular she goes
further into.
Valencia County.
Within the Albuquerque area
started Rio Rancho.
So Rio Rancho experienced a lot
of growth and we had to figure
out a way to address that grow
to order three Rio Rancho
districts forty four fifty seven
sixty they are entirely with Rio
Rancho twenty three is a little
bit different than what you have
today twenty threes to go from
crosstown along course.
It's now court for Alice little
bit or a Rancho Palos into the
north valley a little bit.
In the north valley this is one
of the bigger changes within
Albuquerque house seventeen used
to be in the north valley.
So because of so much growth on
the west side we had to have a
district that in this particular
plan actually moved from the
north valley across the river is
now a west side district to give
more representation to the west
side so how seventeen ends up
being a district kind of a
course corridor District from on
time you up to about paralysis.
The rest of the website is
fairly similar to what you have
today with respect to testimony
about the river the boundaries
to follow the river from relief
center all the way up to
Alameda.
And with respect to the
international district that is
entirely contained within house
nineteen.
So respect to the native
American is six we saw sixteen
American districts adult
population all over sixty to act
over sixty percent adult a
native American population one
of the read one of the ways that
was accomplished was that the
deviations in the northwest
we're working with the ten
percent total deviation with
respect to the districts.
In the northwest all the
districts are about negative six
negative six and a half
and for sprint to the deviation
so one of the ways that the
native American population was
for districts or reserves was
the keep the districts on the
northwest part of state a little
bit lower in deviation to try to
keep them all of us sixty
percent adult native American
and had impacts on the wrist the
state so if the largest negative
deviations six point six on the
other side no other district and
be above state three point four
in the positive side.
Okay so that's concept the one.
The next two plans are
essentially the same plan just
what the difference north west.
So these plans this these plans
were created after we received
the input from the Navajo Nation
they had in northwest plan in
the public consensus the of
public council governor
governors it came up with a new
plan for the northwest and so we
integrated both ideas into a
single statewide map.
With in Albuquerque I think we
have the roughly the same
concept with respect to house
seventeen it does move to the
west side similar to what we saw
before but in this particular
map you'll notice the Rio Grande
is used as a boundary from the
county line all the way down to
south of I. forty so forty four
stays in Kerala's is to Prosser
Rancho twenty three used to be
in cross and down along the
course Boulevard now it is a
completely as a district
completely contained within Rio
Rancho from and ten hills down
along I twenty eight and between
five twenty New Delhi to
roughly.
Sixty get is entirely within Rio
Rancho doesn't cross the county
line the districts on the west
side are fairly compact you'll
notice again that down to about
has found fourteen sep around
bridge to the county the
counties to follow the river.
International district once
again is entirely within a
district in house nineteen.
In house twenty two this these
mountains and does include all
of Moriarty and Torrance County
Edgewood is entirely within
house fifty we did hear some
testimony about Edgewood to try
to keep as within within a
single district.
House is fourteen seventy of
once again our test labor trying
to keep that north central a
rural community representation
with in the redistricting plans
so you order fourteen seventy
north central forty one and
forty two as well as forty
points again crosses the sum
greater crystals.
Sixty three is a little bit
different of what we saw before
eight in this plan again sending
of America excusing adults
Hispanic district that does go
from Clovis to this building
communities within Santa Rosa
but it does have to extend
further west into Willard.
It helps take the pressure off
of north eastern New Mexico once
again sixty four extends from
Clovis into port Alice but in
the previous plenty saw that it
went to Ross well in in concept
I one this concept but includes
the the Pueblo northwest sixty
four does going to forty
thousand Clovis but it is not
going to Roswell it is goes to
the self down towards Hobbes.
It includes Tatum in the county.
So that means that sixty six can
stay a little bit closer to what
you have today it does go from
Roswell and it has all of
Lovington.
And it allows sixty two to keep
the north part of hops.
One thing is this that this does
do is sixty one doesn't have a
loving ten then it has to pick
up operation from somewhere and
it does extend into southeastern
Eddy County and you end up with
a southern Hobbs jail Younis
loving district with respect to
have sixty one.
Fifty five in is completely
within Eddy County it's
primarily a Carlsbad district up
towards local hills fifty four
in the previous episode fifty
four was from Alamogordo all the
way towards Artesia in this case
it's Artesia a little bit of
Carlsbad lake Arthur in southern
China's County and it stays
within eighteen plus a couple
precincts within within Chavez
county so it's a little bit it
smaller geographic area the
little more compact than what we
saw before.
Terms of fifty three fifty six
and fifty one.
Pretty
Compact districts Otero County
based Rideau so based fifty
three is something similar to
have today with respect going up
towards on the portal.
Within us crucis the basically
the changes were just trying to
stay in the lines out a little
bit and create districts were
compact and a similar to roughly
similar to which that districts
trying to straighten out the
boundaries.
Begin thirty thirty nine we did
swap some population between the
two our server city is entirely
within a house thirty nine
though in this case House thirty
nine does expand into catching
County which forty nine needs to
have southern counties combined
with Hidalgo County North for
unanimous and damning into a
single southwestern district.
Thirty eight is that tier C..
Part of tier C. and then it goes
into Los crucis to perpetual's.
Forty on a subpopulation to
thirty nine in terms of catching
County and does extend north and
includes all of billion a
district eight is a Los Lunas
Center district district seven
does go from these other river
and down into southwestern
Torrance County to include
mountain there.
A bit different as house fifty
extends from southern Santa Fe
county Eldorado area includes
all of procedures and all of
Edgewood so we keep in touch
with United into a single
district okay.
So this is the and the northwest
part of the state it's the plan
submitted to the C. or C. by the
public consensus group.
And you still have districts one
two and three in Farmington
Aztec Bloomfield area with
district four because Shiprock
south of Farmington area from
water flow down the Burnham a
district I starts infants in the
north and goes through nice TD
into Gallup and also includes
Crown Point.
District nine starts in Arizona
border has Mexican springs as
northern and goes to Gallup and
adds a couple prisons is any was
important to the public group in
this plan to have part of Zuni
in one district and another part
in another districts as any is
split between districts six and
nine in concept I want.
So this six six as part of the
Zuni and it and the northern and
has Pinedale and goes through a
young to toe to Ramon and over
to grants and align sixty nine
is another native American
district of the gonna act misled
a public up through public
contato another nation and up to
the top of cultural and
historical park and lake valley
and its northern most and it was
important to the Pueblo group to
include that type of culture
that helps Stewart go park into
house sixty nine and finally.
House sixty five is and is very
similar will be seen at all the
plans because in dual say
hickory down into Sandoval
County and the because the
public including Bernalillo
taxis Senator public.
Okay in the final plan.
Is J. this was the same rest of
the state the only difference is
within northwestern New Mexico
so J. we've incorporated the the
Navajo Nation northwest into the
plan and I'll just kind of talk
about the really quickly about
the differences between the two
between house six and nine in
the Navajo Nation northwest plan
Zuni's entirely within districts
six instead of being split
between two districts that
forced a ripple effect in the
through in Pinedale chapter
areas and and more in a late
chapters were somewhere in the
Navajo Nation someone plan and
other in others there in the
public consensus plan.
Google changes within Gallup
between stopping between houses
I have districts five nine.
water leaking grants swabs
districts southwestern Valencia
County
the public consensus has
another precinct with influencia
were as the nomination plan does
not.
Cuba.
Is not in the northwest region
so the region itself out of
boundaries in the.
Another nation plan includes
Cuba and the public does not and
now that the onus is within a
Pueblo consensus native American
district of the Navajo Nation
Cuba is not based on a six state
American adult instructs sixty
two percent or above.
And again in these last two
plans the deviations when down
to almost negative seven percent
in the northwest and so the rest
of the state is no greater than
plus three percent total DVR
deviations for a total deviation
of less than ten percent so
that's a description of each of
the three plans thank you very
much.
The
last thing I just wanted to the
I wanted to make sure that.
The house was.
Fully informed of and taking
into account two thousand people
that were involved in the
process of creating the plans
came with their plans their
neighborhoods
where they want to be in their
communities of interest.
Very
Really from the American
coalition.
What they wanted their plan to
look like I want to make sure
that the house understands that
the voting rights act district's
and even managing populations
Critical to being in the federal
compliance these are these
districts and it can the
citizens of the native American
lands telling us what they want
is what's on these maps.
In southeastern New Mexico.
There was
There's a very impassioned
group.
Of Mexican Americans they came
in and testified.
About the changes increasing
their population and more need
to be heard in to have the right
to vote which they did not.
The.
that group of.
Every workers and many times
most of it.
A shaking at the podium telling
us what they did in referring to
be in public they were not
expenditures
I know that it was important for
us as a committee that the house
understand that.
Their input right down to
pulling up the judges saw.
Neighborhood by neighborhood
other districts are split down
southeastern New Mexico and that
they want to be heard.
serve
as well as a black an African
American brothers and sisters
and that came the representative
cultural center explains where
their populations are and then
they also want to have influence
and felt that they have not
heard because they have a small
percentage of our overall
population.
Michael Schardin chin the
Alan of our agent in refugee
population.
District all six neighborhood
associations
appeared as a group of.
As well as.
Urban native American.
Population and talked about
their needs all of these things
were taken into consideration
and that sort of you Sir it's
that settlement chair and turn
it over to you thank you very
much for the.
Time and attention everyone to
what we really felt was an
incredibly important process
thank you.
Great thank you and Mr Senator
offer you here for question and
answers for you to have a
presentation as well.
Madam chair we have a PED to go
over the Public Education
Commission but if you wanted to
take questions now house I guess
that would be appropriate before
we move on to the next stage
okay that'll be great thank you.
Thanks to this year's C. for all
of your work and I was only able
to attend one of the meetings
but I know it went really really
well and I appreciate that
everyone was very attentive to
the testimony that was provided
and to think The New Mexicans
for coming out and really
providing their impending I
think that's really important so
if we could get folks to press
the RTS phone if you'd like to
ask questions.
On the house.
We have the gentleman from curry
Representative Crowder thank you
madam speaker madam chair I'm
sorry Madam can you give us the
corresponding bill numbers that
go with each of the maps so that
we can kind of mentally tie
those together as we work
through this process.
I believe the madam chair that.
Matt the one someone mentioned
through that process that.
House Bill eight was the
corresponding bills to map the
one is that correct.
let's go to the Representative
Eli to help with that madam
chair the gentleman yield.
Yes madam chair no I yield short
answer question because I was
looking up myself so concept
human which is the problem out
his house bill three.
The navy the nation of the
Navajo Nation map on which is
concept J. is house bill five.
The one.
His house bill four.
And the remaining ma'am.
that was
offered after there was a
consensus among the tribal
interests is house bill eight.
That is not included in the
package because the tribal
interests had not yet reached a
consensus by the time the
citizens redistricting committee
had finished need extra that's
why they haven't discussed house
bill eight.
Okay and the concept numbers
again please I'm having members
telling us for the.
madam chair again of the
gentleman yield I can go through
it again I'm happy to do it.
Thank you Sir I feel so concept
hi.
Which is the problem apparatus
house bill three.
The committee just learn
something we don't have to yield
thank you Representative Maestas
part I Navajo Nation which is.
Madam chair I I know that on my
desk I have the in the notice on
the show she to pay for.
It has a house full of the
concept number and everything on
there that would have been much
easier and thank you for
pointing that out I appreciate
it.
Thank you Sir I apologize for
the course of my only other
question is what what role did
Geographic proximity play in
this process is as far as
concise compact districts how
was that waited in this process.
Madam chair representative
Representative Crowder.
If you look in.
It is report committee.
This legislative.
It goes now is.
On compactness traditional
redistricting principles were
important one followed were
greeted by independent groups
and you can find the full
analysis of that on every single
one of these plans in the report
that was published to the
legislature that report is
present on Mexico it's called in
in re districting dot over you
look at the tap for final report
it will have all of that data in
excruciating detail.
Thank you very much appreciate
that I just happened to notice
that one of my joining districts
had a much more number than the
thirty thousand to fifty or or
right at it and the district
that I represent has expanded
tremendously but it picked up a
lot of a couple precincts.
That my number is higher than
that district I wondered why
that taxed to district sixty
four instead of district fifty
eight our goal there look at
that and then I guess that'll be
part of the discussions we have
some madam chair thank you very
much.
Thank you and before we go to
the next Representative I just
want for those folks that
weren't able to hear the
dialogue back and forth
everything in the bill locator
and everything online for the
maps that are now house bill's
do include the concept so that's
also something for the public to
know so those are located right
next to it.
Do you want to add on to Mr
center of this madam chair just
on that last question.
So as we know
Each district
there's an ideal population for
house district the ideal
population for house district is
simply taking the population of
the state of New Mexico two
point one million and dividing
it by seventy house seats that's
the ideal population and within
these plans each district Shelby
within approximately minus seven
two plus three percent higher
than that ideal population.
it's very important that the
total population deviation
between the smallest district
and the largest district not be
more than ten percent so that's
why under maps like this it's
approximately minus seven.
Last three percent from the
ideal population Mr sharp
explained why that in the native
American districts the lower the
higher negative deviations or to
account for a loss of
population.
But when you're looking at your
own district and you might say
well Gee it falls right within
the ideal population why did I
lose of these three precincts or
gain these three precincts he
really should never look at your
district in Ireland you must
look at your district as a
region.
You might say I just need to
pick up one hundred people your
neighbor might be saying I just
need to pick up three thousand
people and so look at the entire
region when you're considering
why a district boundary may have
shifted it may be due to things
way beyond
or as I like to say no district
is an island.
Thank you.
And and next we have the gentle
lady from Santa Fe
Representative Serrato thank you
madam chairwoman and thank you
to the presenters and all the
hard work you all done on the
past few months it's really been
noticeable and I really
appreciate that are outreach on
this chart as you refer to a
little bit of the demographic
shifts that were happening in
some of those populations that
came out I'm hoping that you can
speak a little bit further I'm
just especially you know you
mentioned New Mexico you
mentioned earlier that
you know there was a sixty sixty
five percent drop in the
northwest but then a of the
fifty plus fifty five percent
growth and and eighty Q. Rio
Rancho on the new also mentioned
in the southwest as well and the
twenty five percent the
southeast I'm just curious again
about demographic shifts in
total if there's anything in
particular you can say about
those regions.
Sure and I appreciate you give
credit for them to percentages
for that is that that part of
the census work it's definitely
something that research is best
at explaining things so in in
talking about population growth
and change on the the.
It is what was minority status
in those areas and handed over
to Mr sent off to to question
thank you Representative.
Yes it's very true that the
state of New Mexico only grew by
two point eight percentage
points during the past decade
that was the slowest growth in
the history of the state.
However there was inconsistent
or uneven growth within the
state for certain regions did
not keep pace with population
growth in other regions exceeded
it.
in the northwest region.
it's not that they've lost sixty
five percent of their population
it's that they were sixty five
percent short of the ideal
population of one policy.
And so it just simply means that
their boundaries had to expand
for the high negative deviations
had to account for the fact that
to account for these population
shifts so the northwest region
part of the address that first
slide expanding the boundaries
slightly into non native lands
and second by having higher
negative deviations so that
their districts would have to be
so large
on the west side of Albuquerque
there are four house districts
that the cumulative.
Where there were four house
districts there was enough
population for four point eight
house districts.
And so that's why you see shifts
like you've seen in these maps
that Mr sharp showed we're
district seventeen moved to the
west side all poll see move from
one region to another because
that region had enough
population to accommodate do you
a new C. yes sometimes an area
only grows or loses twenty
percent of ideal population and
that is usually addressed with
not by gaining or losing new
cease but shifting the
boundaries to make it all work.
Thank you madam chairwoman thank
you Mr sent off of the new
funding bill that's very helpful
I am curious also about again
demographic shifts you know
people of color communities as
well.
If you can explain to stop one
of the.
Yes.
Well it was interesting that
We were expecting a higher
percentage spending frankly than
the census bureau actually
reported I was surprised by the
number of the adult population
of voting age Hispanics being
about forty seven point two or
so native American eight point
nine percent voting age
population I was a little
surprised by that night I
personally attribute some of it
to an undercount we can't prove
it but we've we've we think it
was there.
One thing that we've noticed is
that in the house seats where
there's more of an immigrant
population.
Places like in hops in Roswell
on the south valley of
Albuquerque the percentage
spending grows.
But if you look at some of the
house districts in places like
Santa Fe some of the more higher
income Hispanic areas the
population Hispanic actually
dropped.
And a native American areas
though even though the
population of the region lost
population often times the
percent native American in those
native American districts
actually rose it was more of a
white and Hispanic flight from
northwestern New Mexico than
there was a native American
flight and so their differences
that we see so in house district
fifty eight or sixty one or
sixty three for you have a
higher immigrant population that
percent Hispanic actually grew.
Thank you madam chair thank you.
Thank you next we have the
gentle lady from grant to the
local and Sierra Representative
Dow.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you for the presentation
Could you describe the
difference to me when you talk
about the committee being.
Nonpartisan what do you what do
you perceive as the difference
between a bipartisan committee
and and nonpartisan Committee.
Sorry for the
trying to get our microphones
straight out here.
So
Chair and Representative Dow.
The process that was followed.
When I say nine nonpartisan or
bipartisan remember the
committee had zero zero
political data.
I mean we had no idea what the
political performance was for
the party performance of any
district that we were looking at
so when we say nonpartisan I
mean that all decisions were
made exempt from party
affiliation or prior voting
patterns we literally did not
have any of that information
thank you thank you madam chair
and thank you for that answer
and so.
Of the two thousand people who
came and spoke and and asked for
the name recommendations do you
know what percentage of those
were part of the center for
civic policy and and
Representative and Russians that
identify them as such.
Not that isn't information that
can be known I don't know that
information every single public
meeting was videotaped it is
present on the website and every
comment of the hundreds of
comments that are on the website
in the maps that were drawn up
all that data exists if it wants
to be found that's not something
that the committee concentrated
on thank you so thank you madam
chair and thank you for that
what's the population of New
Mexico.
It is two million one hundred
and seventeen thousand
approximately thank you madam
chair and and two thousand
people provided public comment
in the state to assume that
around forty to fifty percent
were folks from the centers for
the policy so that means you
know a thousand six hundred
thousand leaving around twelve
twelve thousand to twelve
hundred people who were not part
of that that group
of the population.
Of the overall population Mexico
versus the people who commented
from one representative groups
that seems you can feel
confident saying that that
represents the voice of the
entire population New Mexico.
So all the Representative Madam
chair of Representative Dow I am
a lawyer all right so I
understand the statements that
you're making I don't think that
they're joined together
appropriately we were given
input in particular regions of
the state
and I think the the group that
you were talking about we heard
a lot of
Mexican American the committee
in the Roswell a public meeting
of the and then northern meeting
in Las Vegas we heard a lot from
the affected association that
ranchers were in the Los crucis
group so it we did not have a
unified the.
Group of people at any meeting
we had regional participation
it of in all of those areas so
we need to be quite honest I
can't tell you who is with
center for civic policy we don't
know one way or the other we
just listen to the people that
we're talking about their areas
in their neighborhoods
New Mexico's of his largest
state in the country and the
geographic regions are huge in
so when people made the effort
to get to us we listen to them
period.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you for that so can you talk a
little bit more about Senator
and Grant County in particular
they're saying like we've been
divided committees have been
divided and that separates our
voice could you talk a little
bit more about what they thought
the impact of that had been and
why it was important to not
divide those areas.
Zoom is far as the public
committee is concerned as I said
the exact statements every
single one that was made in the
names of the people who made
them are literally on a record
so you can look at that in
detail
but is far as communities of
interest which is really what we
were looking at
when we held one of our public
meetings we an impact to the
public meetings we had
satellites in Silver City and in
so people came and spoke about
what they cared about and
literally said they didn't
understand why their neighbor in
Silver City wasn't in the same
district that they were in they
felt that their communities of
interest were United and that
was the I mean that was the
input that we got from the
citizens of that area during
those public meetings.
Thank you madam chair and and
thank you for that and so in
order to apply to those folks
who came and said we don't want
our voice devided we want to be
United it appears that in every
map you have to divide other
communities that we're currently
not divided first example Sierra
County at the same the
population of truth or
consequences in the pop the
population of Sierra County was
not divided but in order to
apply to the request of Grant
County you have to divide what
is now United rural community in
Sierra so happy was someone had
to be there if if I guess what
I'm getting at is.
If someone didn't come and say
please maintain what we have
don't divide a rural community
in the work they could have been
divided because the people who
showed up said we're divided now
please United but I think that
that that suggestion that a
small rural community not be
divided on the left side or
right side of the river.
Just to the north in New Mexico
folks in southern New Mexico
would have exactly the same
concern but they want their so
their recommendation wasn't
considered in the chosen map.
So chair and Representative Dow
This process was created so that
we could get public comment from
the citizens who had the opinion
and the will to make what they
wanted no and that's who we
heard from as far as people who
did not attend
we didn't.
That was not our our charge we
were to listen to what the
citizens who came stated that
they needed and and that's what
we did thank you madam chair and
thank you for that answer so we
all know because you know it's
been widely publicized that
the center for civic Policy
attended every single meeting
and brought lots of
representatives with them sites
when asked this legislative body
tasked the redistricting
committee with drawing maps that
work that did not consider
partisan data and did not
consider incumbents addresses is
that correct.
Not entirely.
Madam chair representative Dale
we were not and did not consider
for and don't know frankly that
partisan data that pieces
correct right but as far as
the other charge about
incumbency is concerned the
redistricting act has a very
specific statement in it that
that we're not to take that as a
primary charge but instead are
to look at traditional re
districting principles in front
of incumbents addresses and so
well that was looked at and
discussed some of frankly we
understood the legislature was
going to do whatever job it was
going to do after us but that
was not a that was not a primary
consideration for any of these
maps.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you so you're telling me that
pulling in research was not
tasked with creating a map.
That did not consider those
things the gentleman beside you
did not create a map that
followed the recommendation of
the legislature to not consider
incumbency and not consider.
One of the gentlemen and they
develop amount that we have not
does not been presented to us
today.
Representative.
Research and polling
Drafted different maps.
According to the statute that
you of past
it then required that the C. R.
C. a job at least three maps for
PVC house Senate and Congress.
To move on to you for
consideration there were other
maps that were drafted.
And the C. R. C. members chose
from among those maps and voted
on them.
Yes thank you madam chair and
thank you I understand that's
what I'm trying to get to.
Are any of the maps that you
drafted using the guidance from
the New Mexico legislative body
and from the fair redistricting
committee that created the roof
the citizens redistricting
committee this is for you to
answer are the for our
consideration during the special
the special session.
Just a yes or no answer.
But I can't give it a yes or no
if I'm not sure if I'm not
authorized to know what the
answer to that question is I can
say to you that within the C. R.
C. website you could not only
see the adopted apps and how
they voted on those maps but you
can see the other concepts are
all there thank you thank you
madam chair and thank you I
guess what I'm trying to get at
is that the citizens
the citizens for civic policy
use partisan data they used
income addresses they used
to make recommendations that
were different than what this
legislative body yes you and
pulling in research and
drafting.
And so the intent of the body
was nonpartisan the intent of
the body was not incumbency
addresses but the maps that are
bring brought forth in the one
that's primarily being
recommended used the data.
That we this in this body
unanimously said please don't do
and that's one coming for it I'm
wondering where the status quo
data is and the one that you
drafted that took into
consideration the request of the
legislative body why it's not
one of the three maps for our
consideration.
That would be a question for
this the C. or C. members not
for me.
Thank you madam chair that you I
and I was told to addressing
him.
Okay that's fine.
Thank you so tell me about the
map that you created and how you
determined the five or ten
percent deviation were you able
to accommodate the request of
the native American population
in your map making.
In our early maps that we
designed we designed to first
around of maps prior to public
hearings
a and then we took those maps on
the road so to speak in a public
hearings showed them to the
public got public feedback
amended another round of maps
and was from those maps of the
State our members selected the
ones that they thought were
appropriate to move forward our
early maps are on the website
and those are from which the
ones that the C. or C. members
chose.
We follow the law to the extent
that and the wall was a little
vague in that it said to.
Shall not the C. R. C. districts
shall not consider the voting
addresses of incumbents except
to avoid pairing them unless
necessary to conform to other
traditional districting
principles so we used our best
judgment
if we saw a district that we
really felt
To conform to traditional
districting principles required
pairing and comments we paired
the.
If it was right on the edge we
could avoid pairing incumbents
and still maintain quality
districts we unfair to and so it
takes judgment.
and then the C. R. C. look for
that to make their
determinations never did we use
political data we we didn't even
have to have it in our computer
there was no partisan data use.
Thank you madam chair and I
think I think I think that the
map that's ahead of us it's it's
pretty clear that it has extreme
gerrymandering especially in
districts sixty six sixty fifty
four forty nine sixty five sixty
nine thirty two and so many
others and we will end up in
court it's up to this body.
To take the oath that was
reminded to us one or two
members one yesterday that we
deserve New Mexicans.
And that we're here to do this
in a nonpartisan way for the
good of all kinds the concerned
and you know it's pretty
disappointing that the public.
Put so much time and energy in
the sixty day session begging
us.
To be fair and impartial and
redistricting get the speaker of
the house has has promised.
To put a super majority of one
party.
And to suppress the voice the
minority and looking at these
districts knowing how important
public land use world community
farming mining ranching is
throughout New Mexico and to see
the maps for that divide and
take away and further pit the
producer from the consumer is
extremely disheartening and at
the less there are some major
amendments and we work together
there's no way this is going to
end up anywhere other than court
thank you madam chair.
So I actually just remember that
we are in committee and not in
the chambers I'm just on the on
the floor as I'm just gonna
start calling everyone by there
Representative name Sir
Representative Lord you are
next.
Thank you madam chair I do have
a question Most because you guys
brought up Edgewood.
If you bend entered did you go
talk to the people of Edgewood
and need to ask some of the
concerns because I went to a lot
of these meetings virtually and
yes they wanted to be put
together acceptance for the part
they just didn't want to be
moved out a district twenty two
which is a community interest in
these mountains centered in
action grown or was our town
hall I was or anything for the
people of Edgewood because even
very frustrated for a long time
that they've been separated down
the middle of the city and yes I
know an action some of people
who didn't ask to be put
together for community interest
does not plan on being put in
the district that had nothing to
do with them so what was the
reasoning for Edgewood and
digital action talk to the
people of Edgewood or have you
been there to see what the
communities like.
So madam chair representative
Millard and to answer your first
question not specifically hold a
public meeting in the Edgewood
did hold over twenty public
meetings regionally all over the
state I think it's fair to say
knowing the tremendous the ease
with which the research and
polling understood the
distracted of course a bandage
but I've certainly enjoyed
we did not.
Want to stay in district twenty
two that I did not hear that I
was in every single one of those
meetings so I don't have that
information but as I as I said
Representative Dow earlier on
every single person that
testified testimony is on the
record and can be found.
Thank you madam chair yes I was
there as well I think they were
under the impression of saying
that they wanted to stay in the
district but they wanted to stay
in the east mountains with their
fellow members who have a
community of interest because
you to understand my district is
very unique there's a mountain
range that separates us it's a
it's a pop Mexico which has been
removed there are now no longer
in a community of interest in
there being completely separated
out these mountains sandy park
so there and saw them student
classes till their terraces in
or out depending on the map.
But is what what's most
discouraging as you took these
mountains which is a starkly
been the east mountains and
completely.
That district into an area that
is no longer the eastbound so I
don't understand how we have a
lot of push for community of
interest I no longer see a
community of interests Senator
twenty two and I'm specifically
just going to ask about my into
my district so can you please
explain to me how corona is now
it is a community of interest
was sandy park.
Madam chair representative lord
I don't know that question is
directed to more or if it is
directed to research and polling
with that level of detail I can
tell you that.
Population and community centers
drove decisions I'm not sure
which map you're speaking about
because there are three of them
so
so if you wanted to just that
question with specificity I'm
sure research and polling could
explained that that section of
the map okay thank you madam
chair so I just got one of the
maps there's one it has no plans
corners can you tell me what a
community of interested clients
cornices with Sandia park.
Thank you madam chair
representative so this the
question is the committee
ventures between clines corners
and Sandia park.
One could.
Point are you it's about roughly
along I. forty.
there's lots of very communities
within the state that is
separate of a long distances
that are combined together.
and I just try to look through
the plans to see if the
districts themselves combined
Sandia park with clients corners
in terms of the about options
that we have discussed.
I don't see any either.
Of and twenty two excuse me in
concept J. thanks in the part D.
is combined with clines corners.
Thank you madam chair or what
what I'm trying to express here
is when the people because I
know my community very very well
am an edge would all the time I
love that district today let
being in district twenty two and
since I found out that they're
no longer going to be in
district twenty two I've got
another phone calls emails and a
bunch of very furious people
don't understand why
historically they've been in the
east mountains which is a
community of interest and very
unique we have a very unique
issues water is a big issue we
have a lot of issues that hold
us together.
And it's very discouraging to
see that that district has been
completely torn apart sensitive
keeping it somewhat similar
adding edge within maybe move
some places out is just I don't
know.
It's all over the place and I
can't figure out how this is
kept the east mountains which
are the east mountains district
twenty two and community
interests when it's all over the
place now maybe you can explain
that to me.
Michael.
Madam chair representative the.
The board I don't know that
there's more that can be said
that it's already been said we
did not have the members of the
express the desire to stay with
in particular Representative
district and so that was just
not something that was
considered
just.
I know one of the educational
components for all of us is in
areas where the population was
lost expanding boundaries was
required to be able to get to
the three thousand two hundred
and fifty people to maintain in
district so that means part of
the explanation for why.
It stands out
but none of those things were
done without what and that we
send to testimony that we
received and so what you have in
front of you is these three maps
that were voted on by the
committee
for the consideration of the
this is us to do.
Thank you madam chair and that's
very forces going missing as a
representative for district
twenty two I have not heard
anybody going the eighties maps
are great a fact of it people
from and with a furious that
they're being thrown in with
representation that is no longer
in their interest and was going
to separate them out from the
east mountains which I think is
completely unfair as a due to so
as a representative for the east
mountains I have to say I don't
like any of the three map some
thank you that's all to say.
Next we have Representative
Anderson.
Thank you madam chairman of.
First I want to thank this
citizens committee for their
hard work pioneering
of this the redistricting
effort.
New Mexico's um C. nineteen
twelve twenty roughly of
redistricting efforts.
so I thank you for your work of
thank you for the time you spent
in twenty meetings and madam
chair my question starts with.
In order to.
Do the work.
Of presenting us today with
labs.
Was the committee only.
Listening and reacting to public
comment was there any other way.
Input was came by the committee
other than these twenty
meetings.
Question.
So the website I made mention
earlier in in redistricting
dot org again a little.
Madam.
Anyone's measure.
As to every single map that was
presented and there are hundreds
of those comments as we did not
only take you through the public
meeting to get input everyone I
in fact we noted that because we
know broadband community with
different parts of the state
that we didn't want technology
to be a very
Trainings for the citizens for
technology and how to comment on
different maps we agreed to take
it anything that was wronged
in and presented in did receive
those kinds of that additional
input off of the website is for
someone to the committee as
well.
Thank you thank you for that
answers the very helpful madam
chair.
As I.
Think about the issue today I
hear us being asked to remember
two approaches on a regional
basis.
And I think okay you know was
that a citizen would was that a
decision made by this committee
specifically to.
To only approach New Mexico's
redistricting for all maps on a
regional basis.
I think we're in the process
madam chair and Representative
Anderson is that.
Starting in the corners.
So not just looking at a region
but that we had to started the
whole all the corners and work
our way in because as a research
a polling was stating earlier
taking a precinct out of any
particular areas shifts the
entire map.
And so.
In our public meetings to try to
get as many people present as
possible we held regional
meetings throughout the state
and that gave us the information
I region but we didn't have any
choice especially the ten
percent.
Chin requirement to go for a map
to be unconstitutional under
federal law and in that we have
to look at the state as a whole
not in one region incentivized
to another region but as a whole
thank you for that
in the in.
We certainly
are familiar with of the many
ways in which we approach New
Mexico's geography in terms of
regions.
But.
What's in my mind on regions
goes like this how many regions
were there in other words you
normally think of for four
corners for regions and that I
think will lead that could apply
that way and Bernalillo county.
Was Bernalillo county consider
that region in your mind.
Question.
Madam chair
Representative Anderson.
There there are geographic
regions to the state of New
Mexico and people look at them
differently you can talk about
the side north central New
Mexico northwestern New Mexico
southwest you know Albuquerque
metro but in redistricting the
region spill into each other.
When you're looking at native
American lands and whether
you're trying to pick up some
additional population to make
those districts hall do you to
go to Cuba Cuba do you go to
pottery to amaze you know when
you're in the southwestern
region that those districts in
Silver City and
Lordsburg.
They didn't keep pace of
population growth but Dona Ana
County a lot of extra population
so you work together with areas
that have gained or lost
population so yes there are
distinct regions but they do
spill over.
Thank you for that Mr Sanders
I appreciate that and that is
helpful I'm going to.
Just sort of a question that
getting close to really this
this whole issue of higher
negative deviation and my lack
of understanding exactly what
that means and that's no fault
of yours but I just really
struggle with okay now when we
talk about higher and lower
standard deviation I think that
means.
How big.
The house legislative districts
are and that we talk about seven
percent under and three percent
over for a full ten percent
number.
And I think we'll of one region
really enjoyed.
The.
Negative seven percent.
That could mean that region
we'll have more house members
and their population.
to the ideal of thirty thousand
two hundred and fifty would not.
The accuracy is used is there
any substance to that idea and
if so which region.
First as to the facts Madam
chair representative what you're
correct the case law is clear
that if if the difference
between the smallest district in
the largest sister stays within
a total deviation of no more
than ten percentage points
you're in the clear as long as
you didn't use that for
illegitimate purposes to you
know something other than
traditional districting
principles for thirty years this
legislature has these plus or
minus five percent is the way to
look at that total deviation of
ten percent this go around there
been many groups in the drawing
of their plans have stayed
within the plus or minus ten
percent but I've got more with
Chris six negative six point
nine three percent and plus
three point one percent that has
happened to answer your question
in the northwest region it was
done because the northwest
region did not keep pace with
population growth.
the one of the primary
justifications for doing that is
that in the native American
areas there are also protected
by the voting rights act and in
the voting rights act there's
certain amount of flexibility
that speaks to protecting
certain defined minority groups
such as native Americans
Hispanics and African Americans
so to the concentration of the
high negative deviations to
answer your question for the
northwest region and the
justification was that those
areas are protected but yes they
will have fewer.
People in each one of their
districts fewer than the ideal
populations so rather than and I
the money is I from the idea
population some of those
districts might have fewer
people they may have minus six
percent from the ideal
population not earth shaking
figure but it is different.
Thank you for that explanation
are there any other protected
regions in New Mexico and before
you answer that question
Representative Anderson will you
please put your mask back on.
Thank you.
Madam chair.
And Representative Anderson
under the voting rights act the
defined protected regions and
those protected regions as it
relates to New Mexico.
Are primarily native Americans
and Hispanics but other groups
are protected as well like
African Americans we don't have
large percentages of of African
Americans but we watch carefully
Hispanics and native Americans
yeah and and the drawing of
districts.
Thank you
then last question on this point
madam chair.
When we talk about this fair.
Voting I I can't remember the
exact federal money.
Reinforces that is that
something we enforce in our
process for is that a court
process.
You madam chair and
representative Anderson and Lisa
Curtis may want to touch on this
but there was a landmark United
States Supreme Court decision
couple years ago that said that
the federal courts shall not be
involved that it is not just the
civil to to take on partisan
gerrymandering in federal court.
Anybody can sue the radically on
anything in state court but for
the federal courts have said
they're not going to take on
partisan gerrymandering.
Thank you
for that explanation one last
question madam chairman.
When I when I listen to the
suggestions that we stay focused
on a regional basis.
I listen to some of the comments
and questions that I heard today
talking about and who would
be some out and slitting.
Need to preserve six native
American districts grant
county's desires Chaparrals
desire could not be split the
state can use haven't quite
figured out what they're.
No
Point was nonetheless I think
we'll all of that he is anti
regional that to me is sort of
all needy greedy precinct by
precinct.
Approach to the issue and madam
chairman I just leave a little
bit puzzled health on the one
hand we're being invited to the
Dodgers remember you gotta do
this racially and on the other
hand I think there's nothing
original about the chaparral is
sitting down there today not
wanting to be split in half and
that's not about eighty region
that's about it the community of
chaparral.
Any response.
Madam chair Representative
Anderson and relating to add to
it.
We wanted to the lot and there
are plans or into this together
and we're particularly in
Congress and
I could only say that.
And Representative Dow even made
some kind of comments yeah
Silvercity rays tech and they
wanted to be together but they
didn't want to be with truth or
consequences the bill is such
that they didn't want to be with
and they just didn't see the
shared interests so to your city
and state or county it was split
the even under the old plan but
yes many people have expressed
their views and there are no you
cannot.
Draw the perfect plan.
There will be some regions where
are concentrating in certain
communities and that might
believe a district that looks
less quality.
It's inevitable.
We're limited by population
were limited by the voting
rights act we're limited by
geographic boundaries and
features.
Each player has some wonderful
districts that
An important to exactly what we
heard but sometimes leave a
neighboring district that's not
as perfect.
That communities of interests
are in the eyes of the beholder
to chaparral they not only
didn't want to be specifically
saw the more in common with
Anthony than with Carlsbad and
so you listen to the different
views.
In argue Kerala's three ways
were pull on some simple on the
Santa Fe County to agree a
Rancho the course Boulevard
corridor so there is no plan
that's perfect and you can
definitely identify districts in
every plan that are that we're
not proud of.
Thank you for that the.
Answer.
I certainly hear nothing that I
disagree with and again thank
you for rather thankless job of
trying to bring these
redistricting ideas before us
today as we do our job on
figuring out redistricting by
their by region for by precinct
by precinct but we've got a
timetable to do it and your
information is been very helpful
and I appreciate your efforts
thank you madam chair.
Right next we have
Representative Pettigrew.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you presenters for your effort
and time in your presentation
today.
Madam chair presenters of money
and the first question.
It is something that is
confusing to me because of our
threes three different things
from all three presenters.
Mr chair presentation the
We had to make adjustments in
our percent deviation in the
southeast because of the
northwest.
Thank you Mr Santa Fe.
It just look at our district we
have to look at our areas are
region.
And the moon under the last
president the other prisoner
saying that we have to look at
the state as a whole and so all
three of you in at all madam
chair all the presenters are
giving a different perspective
and different guidelines so I'd
like to understand how we made
it through this.
Roger Montoya.
Madam chair representative
pedigree I I think the thing
that's been most in the the the
analysis is the reality of the
balance things trying to be
struck between the population
requirements that shifting
population that the changes are
and how to make sure the plan
moves constitutional on in so
called.
Of us are actually saying the
same thing
that the state has to be looked
at as a whole you madam effects
of the other regions around it
in that one trying to use the
law.
in our requirements of balancing
those with the communities of
interest that came and spoke to
us about about what they wanted
consent that on that Mr Senator
respond also.
Madam chair Representative
Pettigrew I heard you were three
comments I don't necessarily see
them of us all and consistent.
we do look at the reasons for
regions to spill over for
reasons stated.
But it's true that if in
northwestern New Mexico we do
have some deviations minus six
point nine three let's call it
mine is seven that would mean
that the and the southwest the
southeast we couldn't have
deviations above plus three so
that that doesn't limit it in no
way but but generally speaking I
don't see your three the
statements that we made as
inconsistent.
Thank you madam chair thank you
presenters I think we can.
We'll have to agree to disagree
on the.
The the.
Madam chair.
With respect to that how did we
get to the negative seven plus
three percentage because I don't
see that in statute that was
passed by this legislative body.
So can you very specifically
madam chair and presenters.
We got a decision who made that
decision the validity behind
that.
Madam chair representative of
the group.
Madam chair representative.
The case law.
The let's long established
speaks to the you know the ten
percent that the difference
between the smallest district in
the largest district not be more
than ten percent that's and
federal case law where they say
as long as you stay within the
plus or minus ten and do it for
legitimate to certain principles
that you know you're pretty safe
the plus or minus five minus
seven plus three that's not in
the law.
ten years ago and twenty years
ago the legislature's set out in
their guidelines not in their
law but in their guidelines a
plus or minus five percent this
time the legislature did in
seventy guidelines so what
happened was different.
What groups started submitting
plans that use deviations
different than plus or minus
five percent and argue that as
long as they stay within the
plus or minus ten percent that
they're perfectly valid
especially if protected by the
voting rights act so there's
nothing in the law about plus or
minus five or minus seven or
three case law tells us they
within ten percent from the
smallest to the largest and
people started submitting plans
that used higher negative
deviations under over than seven
and justify that the way I just
stated.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you for that the response.
In June presenters
this case.
Referred to in aviation.
Percent difference.
To.
Madam chair representative of
Pettigrew first the the classic
disclaimer I'm not a lawyer but
I've been doing this for forty
years.
In the court cases I read they
tend to speak to percentage
deviation.
There is some congressional
cases where you're trying to
achieve almost identical
population a congressional cases
where you'll see some cases
about seven hundred and eighty
nine people but for the
legislature county commissions
you tend to speak in terms of
percentage deviation from the
ideal population of the district
so you divide the total
population of the state by the
number of districts and then
look at the deviation from there
and and is typically expressed
in percentages one also looks at
average deviation and median
deviation as well as total
deviation from those percentages
mean median and total absolute.
And the madam chair and
representative group in the
extensive report that the
committee put together and
provided to the legislature if
you look at pages twenty three
and twenty four.
Isn't that exact
analysis of the case on the.
Speaking on.
Thank you very much for that
answer helps.
So.
Madam chair presenters as they
listen.
what I understand is that we
had.
Communities of interest from the
northwest.
That.
Sen deviation limits.
To the committee agreed and
therefore control with the
population deviation percentage
south.
Houston Mexico would be.
Is that an accurate statement.
Madam chair Representative
Pettigrew so yes if you're
looking at a hi negative
deviation of let's call it.
minus six point nine that would
mean that for the rest of the
state you would not have any
deviations above plus three
point one.
It wouldn't be for anyone
regions as anyone district in
the state couldn't go above plus
three point one to stay within
the plus or minus ten.
Madam chair representative to
answer your question directly we
were presented with plans which
is much higher standard editions
of that.
Committee felt would not
constitutional and for that
reason did not accept those
plans or even gins from the.
Trying to stay very close to
about traditional redistricting
principles.
Thank you very much for that
answer I was just trying to
understand as we look at and
other other questions have come
up with respect to the
communities of interest and.
Yeah so as we talk about.
The communities of interest and
the people that came to the
different meetings.
we're talking about.
Eight point five percent of our
population.
Is this together says as I
understand from the presentation
was given today and massive job
done on it can I take out one
specific group.
We're talking about one we're
talking about less than a half a
percent.
Of the of the population some of
which come from one specific.
Region which would be up in the
northwest corner of the percent
deviation negative almost seven.
Hi this.
The determination for the rest
of the state so if we take all
your different needs Madam chair
of the presenters and.
All the numbers together and
probably down less than percent
of the population now because
one group.
Not
going through to the following
phone meetings around so I'm
just trying to get an idea and I
need to be able to defend to the
constituents that I represent
how.
Eight point two percent of the
state population is to determine
how they vote and who they will
with thank you madam chair of
the doctor.
Next we have Representative
Scott.
In terms.
Quick questions.
Mr chair and roll.
Total population increase.
New Mexico.
Madam chair.
Representative Scott.
in Eddy county the increase of
eighty four hundred and Lea
County almost ten thousand.
So.
You know
Nineteen thousand just in those
two counties alone.
Chavis for in Seoul office.
Of about five hundred.
The only were the big winners.
Yes.
Increasing population knows to
justify a full suite.
We're.
Into the southeast.
straight.
It depends.
Increases were substantially
accommodated by letting us.
Informations.
As opposed to the negative
deviations in the north west is
that correct.
Madam chair representative of
Scott.
That might be overstating things
were looking at
Deviations that could have
sometimes gone to plus I that
could only go to plus three.
and in many cases those
deviations might've been plus
zero or minus for a on the side
so I would agree with that
statement.
Some of the population.
Access I think went to help out
the rural districts in
north eastern New Mexico.
you know the north eastern part
of the state didn't keep pace
with population growth.
On the Senate side what they
accomplished was allowing for
more compact districts Hobbes
could have its own district
rather than sharing with
Carlsbad Carlsbad could have its
own district rather than sharing
with Alamogordo.
The house side we have seventy
first forty two I I would say
that those deviations could.
Probably didn't play
a very significant role and that
more of it went to help out
other rural east side areas that
did not keep pace with
population growth.
But it is true that if we wanted
to have a district to plus five
it could only go to plus three.
Thank you for the Senator.
Sure.
Well as.
Reporter.
Service.
Representative technicians here.
Going forward.
We're going to be prepared.
Coming elections.
We're.
Your plans.
Press we're going to be prepared
in the form.
I was sentenced to
table.
or.
To.
Press.
Currently serving.
In connection with exploration.
Always run.
Madam chair representative of
Scott for sent have to careful
plea review that it's been a
long time since I've looked at
this
So.
In concept the one.
Just speaking frankly.
District twenty for a.
This Daymon Ely and he announced
publicly he was not going to
seek re election and so that
pairing and twenty three and
forty four
I think the Sears see that take
into account if a legislature or
decided that they were not going
to seek re election.
that that if there is a way of
improving a district by not
having to worry about that
provided to our
that was take into account so I
I do know that that may have the
number twenty three is the lie.
In the case of the district
fifteen and thirty one.
Fifteen is representative of
Dayan Hochman Vigil and thirty
one is Representative cream.
Speaking frankly again.
Dayan Hochman Vigil was put into
reams District that because of
rare your Republican district I
don't think we'll be seeing
Dayan Hochman Vigil run there so
I think that's something that
hurts the Democrat.
Her district was consolidated
and became a very tight north
valley district.
And I wouldn't be surprised if
he finds a way of getting into
a.
Third if fifty million and sixty
six.
well Representative Phelps
Anderson has changed from
Republican to independent
correct me if I'm wrong.
madam chair and representative
Scott and so I guess that would
be inaccurate now to call it
A Republican Republican
preparing.
thirty eight and forty nine
forty million.
Is
Armstrong with thirty eight yes
okay very good and.
Frankly speaking.
Representative Dallas publicly
announced running for governor
and US so with that pairing
That was taken into account by
the C. or C. of being less
concerned about appearing if the
C. R. C. follow up that somebody
was not going to be returning to
the legislature.
That would be an example under
that concept so we would end up
really with no pairings of
people who to our knowledge are
actively seeking reelection
under that particular plan.
In terms of the rules was not
very low.
Of those considerations.
Would have.
Come to the fore.
Madam chair
and Representative Scott it
wasn't part is and whether they
were Democrat or Republican
Republican Republican Republican
Democrat and that was just
dealing with an issue of
legislators retiring regardless
of their party.
Thank you madam chair thank.
Ranchers and last question.
With respect to all school.
And presented to this body.
Not have.
One of your clients
Associated.
With the use of legislation.
Secretary
of state madam chair
representative Scott I don't
know what house bill and it is I
I have no idea so I out of the
hundreds of the comments that we
got I have no idea whether it's
Representative it isn't I I've
never seen it.
For the.
Chair.
One
was redistricting committee.
Thanks.
The original
as well as.
Representative sure.
The legislature.
And I know our understanding
madam chair and representative
Scott is that our our job is
done
we.
Our statutory period is over
I'm here simply to answering
questions and resent the maps
that we passed to I I don't
believe that.
Permit to do that work under the
current law as it's written.
Search.
Next to have Representative
Alcon.
Thank you madam chair I really
don't have any questions.
Just a couple of observations.
I was the only member of this
body is sitting here today that
voted against the bill creating
a piece.
The sentence redistricting
committee.
With some people even tried to
the last the other day house
Judiciary of money to the floor.
To get this done.
No observation is.
We want we did.
Would be.
Were you able to like does a
legislature three this spring
while this is to the people of
the state of New Mexico.
It would be somebody else.
I job as legislators we just
send student is going to lay.
No.
This is what I'm hearing today
for certain people.
The legislation creating this
redistricting committee the same
people that everything in their
power to even the last a bill
out of the house Judiciary and
those who say.
One of the other part.
What what what what.
The.
This
last but lost to.
Well I'm gonna be with this we
were gonna do with this was.
Out of her way.
So why are you complaining to
the that's all that's all I'm
seeing them chair I.
Because of.
What is this ticket.
Your maps of the.
That's what you wanted.
I did not want that I want to us
and saying the citizens of New
Mexico.
And for us to go out there and
address the people of the state
of New Mexico not somebody else.
That doesn't even have a right.
Two so this is.
Madam chair.
Next we have Representative
Maestas.
Thank you madam chair thank the
presenters.
And as a couple thoughts maybe a
couple questions
want to thank you for the
tremendous tremendous work I
just to.
Some of the things online and
then of course is with gracious
enough to come up to my side
school and present and and hear
my neighbors.
Concerns with a just a
tremendous tremendous job.
Madam chair this is a prison and
Justice Chavis obviously the
folks.
Thanks in research and polling
with expertise and I'm.
And the hardest working interim
committees and was a tremendous
along with LFC.
But I.
You have to remember that.
Four point of the last two
months Madam chair of the Courts
to the maps in two thousand and
the courts and the maps in two
thousand eleven.
That's why.
Jack.
What is.
I have a section for them
constituents have an affection
from.
It's hard to change them.
It's a bit harder to change.
District to.
What district and.
It is difficult to use of the
district.
From laws will to run to.
A district move from.
To the west side and in addition
from the it has over the west
side that.
It's ten.
The scene now.
Because I believe that in order
to us is is a is a six seventeen
which was from Albuquerque's
north valley madam chair to his
website that's the only kind of.
That's going to occur to
remember a couple of things one
is.
From.
Nineteen sixty six.
The first for.
For those of our state's.
Two senators.
Senators will all of.
It wasn't until the building
was.
Sixty five percent.
Mexico.
Distributed Senate BAPS and and.
The.
Good times got representation.
Tom Kricka did not have
representation.
The Senators today.
It has not but is not.
I suppose a lot intonation and
and a lot of.
A lot of places statewide.
Existed was.
Haven't had any given time.
Because of the town has size.
Has as members.
The other towns have none.
It is simple madam chair that it
was a the total loss.
The time has.
These
numbers two thousand one not.
For
that is to this.
Extending out into the.
It is surrounded and.
House members.
So a total of forty thousand
people have for house members.
Hi my name is.
Two hundred thousand people
have.
Members.
So when was.
There's a lot of the justice to
allow.
Apps perfect.
These maps to because it doesn't
want to those eleven.
Maps to communities of interest.
In addition to the
tops are much more
visually.
statewide madam chair in this
more compact excludes as opposed
to.
No
you know this one that showed
that districts I just want to
commend the.
Commission for that because it's
hard.
That's two to distributed tax
two precincts.
This of this commission
commission and I look at
politics at all which.
Eleven maps with politics.
And instead looked at
County lands mountains rivers.
These streets and and really try
and those communities of
interest.
Madam chair because some
communities want to be split.
You want to be in the middle of
the district other committees
want to be split because
you know if you.
Transaction that the forties
fifties sixties have political
power to house members.
This is the biggest towns in New
Mexico.
All of you know kind of the kind
of.
What is the classic example
under building on the
Representative I'm the
representative.
West Texas one person one vote.
One person.
Not one person eighteen not one
person.
To for generations.
Last Tuesday.
What is that person one that is
the bedrock of our democracy and
the
democracy in New Mexico.
Better as a result of these and.
Maps that have been presented
today but.
You madam chair.
In dividing up the state in
seventy you know relatively
concise districts is.
Amendment to the voting rights
act the struggles of the voting
rights act and so on I just
talked about native majority
districts is back and will be
districts and one that is not
only necessary but.
Constitution and mandated and
and how difficult that is to
ensure that that happens in
addition to Townsend counties
around rivers committees and
choose to.
Prisons that will
serve up some
I guess Mr Senator wants to
answer what.
A native American majority
district we have now and how
many this proposed state in the.
The hospital and then and then
also with regards to spending
the twenty districts.
Maintain that constitutional
requirement.
Madam chair
Representative last is yes there
are six currently.
Native American majority sixty
percent or higher districts in
the northwest quadrant and under
these plans those six remain.
and also the the parity of the
Hispanic districts remain as
well they might be slightly off
by one or two in each plan but
most of the plans have I think
twenty six twenty seven Hispanic
majority districts
Representative Michael young.
For that Mr Madam chair
representative on.
Representative concert ten
percent.
New Mexico ten percent of the
population into seven major
districts.
You know seven hundred seventy
ten percent.
Six minutes is impossible to do
seven.
Phone.
Two six.
Districts.
Over six.
The population but that would be
just too difficult as well so.
These that **** legislators
lawmakers the map makers
themselves and we must maintain.
Senate Majority districts
have to maintain a native of the
major districts which adds to
the difficulty.
The other districts
It affects our districts and and
how did on it we have to respect
that you know we have to
respect.
You know I loss of reasons that
I love to get some some new
neighbors that I look forward to
getting to know.
All of the some on that same day
you know
You know ten years ago to
Russell folks had to run against
each other and to the house
number of the north chose to run
for the Senate.
The person I had some retired.
Again his neighbor.
So it's it's it's difficult
stuff it's it's it's important
to maintain that is to fill
member because it only goes on
every ten years.
But
Twenty two decades.
For twenty nine years to be
directed to.
Of the judicial drawn maps as
budget has led us to the maps
that we have no we have to would
adjust the kitchens and we have
to make them better.
This will be our predecessor
will be happy with.
So with that districts because
of much more easy to manage much
more easy Representative
Townsend for constituents to get
a hold of us and then went on
democratic matters a consenus as
well as it is that the committee
and and thank you madam chair
thank you.
Thank you Representative next we
have the Representative
Townsend.
Thank.
Thank you the town center town
center.
Sorry.
Thank you madam chair and and.
Thank you group for the work I
I was
I was hopeful in the beginning
of this redistricting.
Process that it would remain.
A
A system that I could trust.
And I and I don't mean to
discount at all.
the amount of work that you guys
and ladies have put into the
process because I do appreciate
it.
I am concerned.
With the chosen.
Maps.
They.
Contain what the body tried to
prevent.
And that is political
gerrymandering.
I I had to chuckle in the
beginning when.
When I listen to the opening
statements but because of.
I believe Mr Senator office one
of the.
The most knowledgeable.
People that I know of.
And.
And and has more history in New
Mexico politics than anybody I
know.
And Mr sent off
Is that a wrong statement I mean
you've been in this business for
ever.
You have done more puzzling for
more people than I can count.
And I would say that you are
probably the experts.
In New Mexico politics would you
consider yourself to be that.
Madam chair representative tells
and thank you for the
compliment.
For many people as are than me
but I try my best.
Sent off
Based on your political
experience in your experience in
New Mexico.
Do you see any signs of
gerrymandering in these maps
that we're talking about today.
As mentioned
miss madam chair Representative
Townsend.
These maps.
Comply to the traditional
districting principles.
Of redistricting and when it
comes to equal population.
What concerns me most is
complying to the voting rights
act.
These maps.
I consider that probably their
highest priority that they were
trying to protective American
districts and Hispanic districts
that they thought complied to
minority voting rights so I
would say really good if that is
the equal population provisions
I was a fan of plus or minus
five this is mine is seven plus
three
where the higher deviations for
use they were used to protect
minority groups according to the
voting rights act.
Communities of interest.
Is in the eyes of the beholder.
And I have sat through all these
meetings around the state and I
don't think I missed one of them
in the second round.
And frankly I did hear people
with very different viewpoints.
I heard the immigrant
population.
Speaking.
With their heart about.
Issues relating to minority
voting rights unemployment.
And being underserved.
And wanting changes in their
districts or protected districts
I heard from cowboys since
thought that their district in
catching County had no business
being with with the court County
would rather be with northern
Grant County we heard such
different perspectives from and
we did hear edge was always here
keep bedroom twenty two although
we heard that we heard keep its
would together a lot and a lot
of plans intrudes are together
as I said earlier there's no
plan that I'm proud of every
district.
and so.
I can see people with a look at
some of these districts and
disagree with them I think it's
the other people looking at
these districts and agreeing
with them.
the ones that we drew did not
take any politics into account
didn't take partisanship to
count this is we the most of
these plans are adopted they
were turned on by other groups
but they still went through a
vetting process and I can see
why some people would like them
based on the communities of
interest that were selected some
people wouldn't and that appears
to be what we're hearing today.
Madam chair and percent off I
appreciate that
And and I believe what I heard.
Was it to say that some maps to.
Your.
group true in the beginning.
Do you believe are the most.
The sensible maps as being
nonpartisan.
And if you agree.
or they need or you may agree
with some people that look at
the maps that are being
presented today is being.
Potentially in some districts.
Very.
No more than that and then have
political gerrymandering within
that is that wrong.
Madam chair representative
Allison.
I wouldn't necessarily agree
with what you just said because
of the early maps that we sure a
lot of people criticize them
it's just a different group of
people and so it depends on
one's perspective in our early
maps.
You know we
To commit height seat and put it
in Rio Rancho.
Or see from northwestern New
Mexico North these and put it on
the west side and some people
firmly disagreed with that the
people in northeastern New
Mexico foot the Mada semi go
Colfax areas should not lose
representation in there better
ways of doing it so whichever
maps we drew we were criticized
but it was often times different
types of people who might
criticize us about those plants
because we could not come up
with the perfect happy because
of the population shifts
throughout the state.
And I I do appreciate that I've
I've but my point is.
Is that based on your experience
which is probably
If not the if not the most
experience.
The more for in the state you
certainly rank in the very top
and you produce maps it based on
your experience do you believe
the.
The best and those are the ones
that we're discussing here today
the my apps that we're
discussing here today more maps
that were voted on by a
politically biased Committee.
That said I'm not going to look
in the in the in the US but
they're different from what you
do there different than those in
need presented that is correct
isn't it.
Madam chair representative tells
the I'm not going to get into
the political fray.
I will say this that some of our
early maps were re for before we
received native American input
this there native American input
sometimes came late in the game
and so we did change apartments
to accommodate native American
consensus and that to change
some of our map so I would not a
medically state our maps are
always better and someone else's
maps workers some of our early
maps had to be changed because
we wanted to accommodate
self determination issues as a
related to native Americans but
so I I can say that our maps as
Bruce king used to say we try to
treat everybody equally unfair
we tripped tried our best to
draw maps that take into account
different communities of
interest that's why they were
called Constance because in one
map we put Luna County with
Sunland park in another part the
map settling park would stay
with Anthony and chaparral will
those are different visions and
some people loved one and hated
the other and so I can we can
say that with different regions
as well so I'm not gonna say
when map is better than another
because that would to be
applying my values to as
compared to the the view point
we went around when we took
house district forty in house
district forty one and seventy
and and made them look very
different we we got a nearfall
for doing that and then we would
then do another map a different
way so their concepts with
different approaches you might
like some of the maps just like
others and and that was part of
what we were trying to give the
C. R. C. different options from
which they could choose.
Well Madam.
chair and and.
Team hi I do I do appreciate.
The effort the issue.
Put in to this process I really
do I appreciated and I thank you
for.
I am afraid.
That the facts show that what
you started out trying to do was
hi jacked.
By
advocates.
For.
Political parties and special
interest for their own benefit
and not the benefit of the state
and did not.
I don't believe.
the will of the legislature
informing the citizens
redistricting committee I am
afraid that.
The effort has been
I hope hopefully not for not I
mean I I I think more
information will come from a.
But I am afraid that the that.
It just became another product
the politics and was not based
on what's good for New Mexico it
was.
It was drawn up from what was
good for a political party and
that is unfortunate it's very
unfortunate but madam chair I
appreciated again thank you very
much for your work I I do
appreciate.
Next we have Representative
Ezzell.
Madam chair thank you very much.
First off I to want to thank you
folks for doing the hard work
for attending all of the
meetings I was able to attend in
person to the meetings I
listened in on quite a few of
the others.
I guess my concern here madam
chair in the committees.
I am not about to let the rules
for the state of New Mexico
Mexico and heard.
And
It was stated earlier by one of
the the Representative seven
Rossell had four different.
Representatives at one time that
was true but he seems to forget
that at that time whenever there
were four representatives that
they taken a majority of those
rural populations that tied the.
And it wasn't to law schools
Travis county.
Also included.
Lincoln County included the Baca
County the included Roosevelt
and Lee counties the list goes
on there.
Of.
My particular district was a
quarter board district for the
minority majority and it was.
Doing that and I believe two
thousand is that correct Mr
center off.
House district fifty eight madam
chair.
Representative Ezzell would
have.
Initiated being forced by the
federal courts in nineteen
eighty four the firm's under pre
clearance in nineteen ninety
one.
And then that district has been
continued ever since in one form
or another.
Yes Sir that is exactly right
and I know that there's a couple
other districts that are the
same way that it that it is
court ordered.
Of the he stated that it was
stated earlier madam chair that
the current population of New
Mexico was two million one
hundred plus thousand and we had
over two thousand participants
for these particular meetings.
these particular special
interest groups that didn't show
up for a lot of these meetings
also attended county commission
meetings and they also attended
city council meetings at the
same time.
We saw a district go away in my
particular area in the two
thousand two thousand and one a
redistricting aspect of it.
But we have seen.
Big growth down in the
southeastern corner of the state
with other areas becoming
stagnant anybody answer the
question but I am going to bring
it up again.
How does a particular area of
the state regain this seat
that's my concern how does that
ever happen how does that voice
go back to four year that
particular district was
withdrawn and moved elsewhere
how does that districts are how
does that particular sector of
the state.
Back to.
Regaining that particularly at
another district.
Madam chair Representative
Ezzell.
So.
If a particular region let's
look at an example
What's happening now.
In Albuquerque what the
bordering the west side in Rio
Rancho where there are four
current adjacent house seats
after the census came out.
There's now enough population
for four point eight six house
seats so we're there are four
there's now enough population
for almost five so you could
that's a very simplistic but is
a great example of how you can
easily convert for seats into I
because the population grew so
much if you only gain ten
percent population fifteen
percent it's not enough for New
C. to emerge so literally what
happens is as happened and
Russell is used to have in the
region about another population
for eleven seats in before you
know it there's only enough
population for ten well that's
where the drafters have some
flexibility to decide where to
secede evaporate word is the
number fifty seven wasn't or
fifty nine then and up in Rio
Rancho that used to be in
Roswell so it takes a great.
Accumulation of population in a
type area that can now
accommodate an extra seat.
So for to happen in Roswell to
answer your question madam chair
representative of the sale it
would take not only Eddy and Lea
continuing their fabulous growth
but Chavez as well which this
this time was pretty much even
Steven and it was more The Andy
Lee where where the populations
chairman this.
Thank you for that explanation.
If.
At
the looking over these maps and
everything and as we said before
I have not been able to pull up.
comes to the movement of House
Bill Page I have not had a
chance to look at that
particular map.
But we see as far as the maps
that we have been presented with
today and I have to have them
all mark we see for example has
districts sixty seven.
And it is a big industry we see
lots of other districts
throughout the state.
And.
This particular districts.
The state Stucker likes to say
it's cap country.
There's not very much population
there the council due out number
this residence that they live in
certain areas.
I used to have a registered
cattle herd that they didn't get
to vote.
Nobody was paying any attention
either thank.
For.
Once again we've we've heard
comments from whenever we were
here last time all the way up
through Project from the last
election I'll put it that way.
How certain areas there's going
to be honest that.
One certain political party is
going to remain dominant in
those particular areas and.
Some people don't want to
realize that we are up here to
do the good for all of the
state.
Not for one political party not
for one particular district not
for one particular region for
what it's good for the state as
a whole.
And I think that we should be a
for mindful of the tests that we
have been charged with to make
sure that that does happen where
there is no.
Direct political influence.
To have any arm twisting done.
Where there is a force of the
membership.
This has to be the way it is.
I hope that the members to
realize.
That being a member from the
rural areas of New Mexico.
That our voice is just as
important as anybody else.
And madam chair.
There's no telling what's going
to happen done in our part of
the world.
Because I know what does drive
the economy of the state and it
is the oil and gas.
Industry as well as the as well
as the agricultural sector of
it.
And.
Whenever I hear comments that
are.
Very disparaging to certain
parties I did get upset about
it.
The madam chair.
We have to make sure that these.
Communities of interest to stay
together and I'm looking at
certain maps here and it is very
evident that some of these
drawings do not fit that.
We have to be mindful of.
The voices that are sometimes
overlooked and being from the
rural areas our voices and our
votes are not being considered
because it is more advantageous
in the more metropolitan areas
and madam chair.
As I said before.
We cannot afford to kill our
rural voices thank you very
much.
Thank you Representative
Herrera.
Thank you madam chair
to represent a rural district in
New Mexico district forty one is
the size of the state of
Connecticut and I think the the
new district is probably going
to be close to the size of
Connecticut.
And
I.
Went to the citizens
redistricting committee on a
Sunday afternoon in the fall and
at the top of the Santa Clara
pueblo.
and I was in the state of.
How kind people were really
everybody was introduced
everybody had a chance to speak
it was a Sunday afternoon and
everybody was working overtime
they certainly had meetings the
day before and had many meetings
scheduled up to that and I think
that meeting that we had in this
manual is about four hours on.
I know there was a great
football game on that day and we
all had to give it up I and it
was part of our you know citizen
responsibility to Tandon to
comment on what we thought would
be fair not fair and
So we have a saying in the north
and then over the county that no
good deed goes unpunished.
So I would invite the members of
the citizens redistricting
Committee to join our club.
This is hard work.
And it's never going to be.
For more from everybody's
perspective that's just what
redistricting is and I think
everybody in this house no sent
everybody in the Senate and
house that.
I will lose some precincts said
I love in the new map I will be
increasing said I always thought
should have been part of
district forty one.
yeah we all have to work within
the boundaries that were given
and we all have to decide on
this and you know if we go to
court we go to court.
You know that's that's just how
this process works to I think
this body has done the best job
we could.
And trying to get a fair and
equitable solutions to difficult
problems.
If we could hired got himself I
don't think he or she could have
done this in add to everybody's
a.
Self interest.
So with that madam chair and
members of the committee I just
like to thank you you listen to
every single person that
afternoon it went on for four
years some people took a lot
more time than I thought they
needed but I thought the
committee was very respectful
and very open and very
respectful most of all very
respectful to every citizen who
showed up to speak before that
body so I would like to
recognize the process that took
place under.
Under the legislation that we
passed collectively in this body
and I understand that everybody
did the best job they could and
with them Madam chair I will
finish.
Thank you representative
Thompson.
Thank you madam chair.
I want to thank all of you who
worked so hard on this I keep
thinking of a rolling stones
song you can't always get what
you want if we all keep that in
mind I think that might
Hi make things a little easier
so
People have been talking about
communities of interest except
for a that's in the eye of the
beholder I mean there's no there
is nothing as as Representative
Herrera said even if god did it
you can't make everybody happy
because everybody wants
something different I mean the
people the people that we
represent I'm losing some of my
favorite precincts that I have
worked my tail off to get them
things they needed and they
would they would vote for me but
because my district was the
definition of gerrymandering as
I learned from research and
pulling them it was a judge a
judge mandated district that had
to be fifty point zero zero
Republican and Democrat and so
am I getting everything I wanted
to know far from it but I think
we need to act like adults and
realize that.
What's good for the state not be
what's the best for us I just
have a question into somebody
said I don't know some small
number of people have weighed in
on this so I'm just going to ask
this question it's facetious but
how could you force more people
to come in and get her to give.
Comments.
The people who chose to come if
you don't like what they were
I'm sorry the you know some some
groups got their people out some
people didn't get the people out
and that that's just kind of.
I also want to get.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you Representative
Powdrell Culbert.
Thank you madam chair.
And.
Thank you all for being here I
just have
One question probably.
And in the center of you said
that.
Representative Eli.
Announced publicly that he was
not running for re election.
So therefore and decided to
combine.
Forty four.
And twenty three.
And I find that that support
justification.
For.
Demographics of the area so can
you expand on that a little bit
more employers that concerns me
because forty four is my
district.
And so this changes the district
completely.
Madam chair.
Representative Powdrell Culbert.
lots of different concepts did
lots different things in the
Kerala S. Rio Rancho area some
you probably like so we probably
don't.
And there is also this issue of
numbering of districts as the
number you get a district of
twenty three or forty four
we debated a lot about that you
know if someone's retiring is
the district look more like of
the other legislators district
into we give it a number of
twenty three or forty four that
might be part of this whole
issue so all I can say is
different concepts handled Rio
Rancho and Corrales differently
and I don't know what the final
determination was in a new house
bill and and how that will all
shake out.
I was just speaking of earlier
about the fact that it would be
unfair to say that to
legislators were paired when one
of them was not going to run
wasn't really were relating to
the design of the districts
isn't it we have tons of
concepts that handled paralysis
in Rio Rancho differently and
it's up to the C. or C. members
to choose.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you Representative Brown.
Madam chair thank you so much
have a couple questions for Mr
Sander of if you would please
indulge me
I'm gonna talk a little bit
about prison populations and
I know in my district I have
some precincts that are very
large maybe five hundred and
sixty some of odors.
And I have some that are much
smaller maybe like a hundred and
twenty three hundred twenty five
something like that.
So it's my understanding madam
chair Mr center of that
precincts are the I guess you
could call them the lego
building blocks of legislative
districts.
So I'm just wondering
apparently were
Just maybe stock is the wrong
word but precincts it appears
are never to be redrawn is that
correct.
Madam chair of.
Representative Brown I'm gonna
start answering that moving to
turn it over to Michael if you
want to add anything this he's
the precincts are of the state
so we have certain state laws
one law is that if a.
In an election for than seven
hundred and fifty votes are cast
in the general election in a
pretty things the county clerk
shall split it so that's one law
then there's another law that
says.
If there are more than twenty
five hundred people in a
precinct the county clerk shall
split it.
and that we wouldn't know until
after the census which is
happened the first one about
votes cast we wouldn't know
until after the general election
so precincts are constantly
being split by county
commissions when they get to
pay.
Then the county commissions have
to decide what's the best way to
split that precinct to hopefully
take into account some
communities of interest in rural
areas where there aren't that
many people the precinct
boundaries tend to be much
larger and hopefully make sense
for that community but the
precinct itself is a function of
a county commissions not the
legislature all of the counties
have to follow the legislative
statutes there are some free
things that are tiny you know
ten years ago the way for the L.
soul area was part of the letter
precinct.
And so is so this time
Bernalillo county decided will
need even though mesa del sol
doesn't have that many people
right now.
What we split the precinct from
missile at a we know may for
bill souls going to grow a lot
one day and that way the
legislature could have more
flexibility if they want to put
the Seville soul in one district
and and and fled in another they
can because we're going to split
the precincts that would just be
one example of the the
determinations that are made by
county commissioners McKinley
County just went through a whole
process of conforming many of
their precincts closer to
chapter boundaries the state of
Americans consider their
chapters to be important form of
local government sent San Juan
county is and some of that so
does that help answer the
question that we will have some
pretty things that are really
tiny of it's a real rural area
and it might related to voting
machines and things like that
and in other places we have
really large precincts but they
constantly get split probably
not only did we split the last
four years.
Madam chair representative must
of split added another.
Five hundred precincts perhaps.
Fifty two votes cast in this
changing the state law.
Madam chair and and gentleman
thank you so much that's really
good information for us to have
a I guess my next question is
the the timing of the county
level changes that might occur.
Do we have those reflected in
what we're looking at with these
maps.
Madam chair representative from
yes we do.
Thank you very much and just a
couple comments that as well
So I I went through
redistricting the last time we
did it and it was very
educational and you know it sets
a template for the next ten
years for the state of New
Mexico whatever the legislature
decides in the governor signs.
but I I think I've I've looked
at now a number of the concept
maps and I see a very this
pattern that has emerged madam
chair.
And it really complies with a
major strategy that was
expressed a couple years ago and
I'm going to paraphrase it was
to me Republicans extinct in the
New Mexico legislature that
appears to be a goal that was
stated by a Democrat leader.
And so I look at these various
maps and the pattern again is
very obvious so we currently
have here in the house of
representatives I think it's
twenty four so Republican
legislators serving Mr Sandra
from my getting that number
right.
Madam chair.
Madam chair of Representative
Brown I think so I think twenty
four yes.
Madam chair and members of the
body I.
The pattern that I see here is
essentially that there've been a
number of pairings of
Republicans.
On the order of at least six
pairings and so six Republicans
would be eliminated by the
drawing of a map in the stroke
of a pen and that's in the body
the currently has a very
minority Republican presence
compared to the majority party.
So to me this is like a lot of
these maps and gives us some of
the maps to the exact same thing
madam chair for example person
representatives and I Burt
committed against each other
socially paired Representative
Dow and Representative Gail
Armstrong we see
again that repeats in a lot of
these we see Representative
Zamora Agence Representative
Chatfield Representative down
again and again well that's
against that as I mentioned just
earlier.
but I think I prefer this
actually very disturbing madam
chair.
That what this really does is
act as a shooting gallery to
pick off Republicans and I think
it is clearly partisan.
And I want any Democrat pairings
and I just I I think maybe
there's one.
But in a body that has almost a
super majority of Democrats you
would expect in all fairness.
For there to be more Democrat
Perry said I think another
Representative made that point
earlier.
So madam chair I I do share
Representative Townsend is
concerned I have higher hopes
for fairness.
We see so much population growth
in the southeastern quadrant of
the State.
And yet that's where most of
these pairings are occurring as
I see that is stripping voters
and citizens of their.
It's a representation and we all
and I think every member of this
body.
We all serve with heart and
soul.
And
skill I think our reference
constituents and to basically
say to so many on the southeast
corner well
You know that relationship you
build over the many years of
whatever term is for not and I I
think there are ways to do
amount that do not have the
effect of of limiting
Republicans with the drawing of
an advantage of signature by
pan.
So I hope we can do better hi I
know that the redistricting
committee madam chair.
is the work of the district and
the citizens commission is not
binding on the legislature so
the question is what are we
going to see being introduced.
here on the house floor shortly.
So that would be what it boils
down to but I also would like to
express my thanks madam chair to
everyone who participated in
this process.
It's very complicated and yes
not everybody's going to be
happy.
But if the net effect is to
eliminate twenty five percent of
the current minority.
Republican representation them
something's very off.
Thank you madam chair.
So we have two more
representatives that will like
to make comments.
At this time I just want to give
a status update on our time
because I didn't realize we go
so
And will allow them and their
excuse me some time and have
state government elections in
Indian Affairs Committee made
to but we do still have the PC
maps to hear about so if we can
keep the questions start as well
as the comments if possible that
would be much appreciated thank
you.
And next we have Representative
find out how to get a.
Thank you madam chair.
And first I'd like to start by
just really commending Mr Bryan
central.
And the team.
And of course is Chris for your
wonderful representation of the
committee process and the
report.
I was privileged to have been in
person and given of COVID and
testimony.
And I was also very thankful to
have been able to zoom in and of
listen to and attend
virtually as well when one
possible and I made my point to
do that.
Because madam chair.
I've been involved in six
senses.
Six redistricting processes.
And I'm absolutely honored to be
sitting in this house of
representatives full circle in
my life to be part of the
decision making process of a
redistricting.
And im also extremely honored
madam chair to be honest to be
part of.
What I saw as one of the most
inclusive.
Processes since my involvement.
So I wanted to to begin with
that.
And just say that we I don't
think we could have done better.
The other comment I wanted to
make was about the
the various groups I think in
all of the redistricting and
census taking up but
particularly redistricting that
I've been involved in it has
always been our intent to
involve the broadest segments of
the communities.
In call whether they be in
coalitions and collaborative
efforts and partnerships but the
broader the better.
And these coalitions and
collaborative and partnership
efforts for all ways and
particularly this time very
nonpartisan and very inclusive
because they represented
communities of interest in
communities around the state and
in my opinion every community is
a community of interest.
In the broadest sense.
But we also know madam chair
that we have obligations and I
think Representative Maestas for
having done a good
representation on major points
because they were very going to
be part of money but one of our
biggest obligations is to the
voting rights of voting rights
act.
In my estimation being a person
of color the in a woman of color
and having been involved in the
civil rights struggles for the
vast majority of my had my life.
So it's incredibly important for
me to pay very close attention
to of the voting rights act how
it's being held and
Representative and all our
processes and I saw that this
was a particularly so in this
process.
And I want to remind all of the
body madam chair that
redistricting is about
representation.
Our job is to represent.
And representation is the best
example and the best exercise of
getting outside of our
individual comfort levels of our
individual points of knowledge
and getting to know those that
are different.
Those in our districts that are
different from us and speak
different languages
that look different than us that
have different backgrounds and
stories to tell Vetr raised
differently with different
values different different
ethnicities different races.
This is what representation is
getting outside of our comfort
level and getting to know the
diverse communities that we are
so very blessed to have in the
state of New Mexico madam chair
solo very blessed to have we
have a long history of long
history of ancestry
representation of native
cultures and native peoples of
Hispanic populations in Hispanic
cultures of every imaginable
community.
Outside of those Andrews six yes
our rural communities for
Representative beautifully madam
chair through the a second voice
and representation so I think
that it is incumbent on us for
everyone who's been arguing
today about how this and this
was it was absolutely madam
chair the opposite of that.
It was about what the state
representative.
And I was so very proud of
listening to the southeastern
part of the state.
Where we had an agency Curtis
you highlighted beautifully we
had lines and lines of
testimony.
From immigrant communities from
native communities from Hispanic
communities.
Historically and that this
region.
They're not able to have their
faces and voices Representative
and that they saw this time
madam chair being the first
time.
They saw an opportunity to be
able to access our electoral
process in order to be able to
have the opportunity.
To be represented.
By Representative best
reflected what they were there
to talk about was their
communities of interest and
their perspectives there are
ways of knowing their ways of
living.
And what they look like and what
they spoke and how they live
their lives so madam chair I
would say that we need to
separate ourselves from this
partisan just.
And what contesting for the sake
of come to the station.
It's not about contesting and
setting anybody up for setting
any of us up.
This is a.
The very essence of what
representation is madam chair.
The very essence.
I did a a very
Bothered and troubled by the
discussion that went on today.
Because I can attest to this
body.
Having sat in and then in
person.
That this was not the case.
Every structure every system
every step of the way this
process undertook was inclusive
and was intentional and I
believe I sent in an almost six
hour session.
At one point I can't recall now
what part of the state was or
whether it was here at the
Indian pueblo cultural center
where I was in person as well.
So the bottom line madam chair
is that we have an obligation.
To the constituency is in the
communities of which every one
of our district representative.
I personally.
Not have knocked on many doors
in my district just in closing I
want to relay this I've spoken
to many many constituents going
door to door I've been invited
in for coffee for Barcelona for
fried chicken you name it.
And guess what to my surprise in
my district thirteen.
I was stunned and surprised to
walk into the homes of Norris
and Spanish Republicans.
And we talked about everything
that brought us together our
values our principles our
culture our language our
traditions and we found that we
have much more in common.
Then the parties that we were
representing or that we have
traditionally voted for.
In the beauty of the story is
that madam chair.
When I visited the polling
places on election day for the
general election those various
Bennett Republicans were in
line.
And they yeah my name and say in
Spanish.
What the the photos.
Yes we're voting for you and
this really is dependent for
publicans and my district in a
general election that I had sat
down and had a meal to share
with them.
What drew us together we're what
we had most in common and they
had no problem out of Boston
party lines.
And that's why I say today that
we've got to remove ourselves.
And do justice to our
communities.
Doing justice toward communities
means.
Taking into consideration and
remembering that redistricting
is about representation and
that's what it is and the beauty
of it is that we have the
opportunity and then I'm just
today madam chair which I may
not be blessed in ten more years
but I'm blessed here today in
this special session.
To get on there to the voting
rights act to all the
trailblazers before me to all
those who fund the Civil Rights
fine so that we all each of us
would have the opportunity to
take on and be part of the
decision making process to
represent the districts that
have been historically under
represented or not represented
and that means that in every
district every region of the
state of New Mexico thank you
madam chair.
Next we have representative
Lente.
Thank you madam chairwoman just
a quick comment and I just
really want to thank the members
of the New Mexico citizens
redistricting committee for all
of you with the time you spend
we've been families to produce
maps in the fashion that you did
the really maps with your
efforts to reach across
different parts of New Mexico
geographically but also with
efforts to meet with the
indigenous groups of the state
of New Mexico and I say digits
I'm talking about the only just
native American but I'm also
talking about the indigenous
Chicano Chicana groups that you
met with throughout our our
great state and I make these
comments not as a Democrat we
Representative here in the house
of representatives but as a
native American that people were
disenfranchised for generations
and generations whose people
only got the right to vote in
nineteen forty eight so in our
seventy thirty year of our
ability to vote.
Our people are now.
Peppered with in this very room
in a way where it brings pride
to not only myself but brings
pride to those that I represent
because it now it it signifies
a great evolution in regards to
what the state is about and that
is inclusion that is in regards
to how we can appreciate how
different we are able to come
together as New Mexicans with
the your Hispanic with your
native American with Anglo or
African American and that's the
beauty of it all and as I said
Hey listen to the discussion to
set this this morning and this
afternoon and I heard some of
the comments being made in
regards to how politicized in
this is it is might be and I
heard about matters of will C.
wood court court court is the
final option.
And I and I find that extremely
the discouraging because.
This effort the efforts that
were taken by the native
American groups that attended
meetings the media efforts to
meet be there in person or or or
view the zoom that took time out
of their days the governor the
president the vice president of
the Senate governors may time
out of the data to make their
comments heard on behalf of the
people that these were efforts
of self determination.
And if a court case is going to
challenge those efforts of self
determination that's a sad day
in New Mexico for all that the
native American populations
we're doing in the efforts to
produce their own maths was
again those notions of self
determination and for them to be
challenged by way of what we
don't like what you do is we're
gonna challenge it in court is
again a slap in the face of to
all of your efforts to all the
members on the district can
committee thank you thank you
madam chair.
Mr speaker Representative of the
measure I want to add to all the
comments of gratitude and
appreciation for all of your.
Hard work it is a huge
undertaking and
Senator Curtis you either C. or
C. members volunteered just like
we do to do all this work you
did it without pay and put in
hundreds of hours to make sure
that we got maps that are fair
and I wanted to touch on some of
my colleague representative
Lente just touched on which is
you know a lot of comments
about.
Gerrymandering and partisan bias
and and this and that and Mr
chair Senator Kerr is that there
was a an outside expert was
hired to review the maps after
they were done.
These are mine the members of
the house in this committee of
what the findings were from that
outside neutral experts who
reviewed the maps.
Madam chair of the speakers in
the yes we is a.
Part of the process.
The.
Find it is actual.
There was a professor of of the
last name of control it was
hired to after all of the
elements for chosen because we
do not have any political
problems data sharing it.
Professor control was to look
over all of our.
Is this because that was not a
component of what we were
allowed to review in so.
Professor controls the statement
was that.
Six partisan fairness metrics.
That we used by professor
control found our maps.
Frankly each plan is school
board but we were given an anti
propose this
and if you look also add to.
It Princeton gerrymandering
project which would serve on
maps of redistricting
nationally.
We were given an eighty funds of
unanswered disadvantages in so.
I I appreciate the question Mr
speaker because.
we wanted to make sure before
plans to the legislature did
this actual issue vetted by an
independent source.
And so yes Sir if you look in
the report it is a fully spelled
out thank you madam chair in the
so I think there's a painting
that it wasn't just the experts
hired by the C. R. C. it was
also the Princeton
gerrymandering project which is.
The most respected for United
States targeting
gerrymandering and in efforts to
flag gerrymandering and to
eliminate it and and the
reference specifically to house
concept in the which is in house
bill eight hundred units and the
the masquerade is that we need
with the tribal consensys maps
for the northwest quadrant so
that's another thing madam chair
that I want to make sure is
mentioned.
in this committee the whole.
is that the all for the council
governor's animation in the
Caribbean nations have all voted
to support House Bill Page
because it is it contains all of
the changes and modifications to
the necessary to respect tribal
sovereignty and self
determination and to make sure
that the wishes
native American tribes of of
those are taken into account so
that they can Census was a
change it was announced
yesterday publicly
that just shows how much work
and effort has been put into
making sure that the native
American Community struck the
state we're not just heard and
that their comments were put
into action with these maps but
the prince and gentleman project
with regard to map in the.
Which is house bill eight the
reason is because of a to F. in
when it comes to partisan
fairness received a grade of a.
So when here folks in his
chamber stated this map is
partisan when it is a partisan
gerrymander the only response to
that is that it is a false
claim.
Is a false claim is shown by the
expert hired by the citizens
citizens redistricting.
It is a false claim is shown by
the Princeton gerrymandering
project and I think you you
madam chair.
It bolster the confidence of the
members
we need to make a decision on on
these maps they have this year
C. influence thank you know that
they're voting for plans that do
not.
We engage in any partisan on
fairness whatsoever we got
multiple experts to see that and
it's.
John and gerrymandered Committee
doctrines to ninety you it's all
there for you look at it's
really beyond dispute but I just
want to make that point madam
chair and again thank you this
year seen thank you research a
polling Mr for all the all the
hard work thank you for being
here for so on G. as in coffee
or water or outbreak.
No okay.
Thank you and and we're gonna
end this one so
Regardless of where we are I
think we have Representative
Montoya next.
Thank you madam chair
I would like to if I could ask
of
Mr center off to answer several
questions here I really
appreciate that madam chair
the.
All the time that this Committee
put in.
And as a matter of fact I guess
I'm I'm I'm a little.
Of.
Confused as to the four
For maps A. B. C. and D. that
were presented in all across the
state prior to taking other.
Before taking outside maps the
committee itself presented for.
Concepts.
That the committee itself worked
on so it's hard to see me over
here I believe so madam chair
like to ask the the question as
to why.
one of those four maps A. B. C.
ending was not chosen by the
committee because that was their
own work and so I'm wondering if
madam chair and Mr center off if
where those four maps were
lacking was there somehow
Wheeler with those for maps
not taking into consideration
communities of interest were
native American and Hispanic
communities ignored in order to
complete the committee did.
so Mr etcetera if you could
respond thank you madam chair.
Thank you madam chair
Representative Montoya.
Where all I would say that I can
answer why those maps were
adopted but I can say that.
Those maps were before we did
receive a native American
consensus so
And it was before we even
receive native American input so
on some of them we just took our
best shot at extending the
boundaries knowing that
The population did not keep pace
in northwestern New Mexico and
we extend the boundaries and
tried our best to dress of the
the native American districts we
are also using a plus or minus
five percent standard which we
were accustomed to its than some
people criticize later
and so some of those maps were
then morphed into new maps that
did accommodate native American
input for example a.
A one would be.
a map that was started with a
and then included native
American input and things of
that like.
So madam chair and and and Mr
etcetera I guess maybe be a
little more specific.
Did not take the communities of
interest into account in the
formats that were presented.
Madam chair representative
Montoya.
We've been working twenty four
hours a day since August and
some of its blurry in my head
but basically
yes we we spoke to C. R. C.
members we
develops of maps but the
intention of these maps were
then to basically take them on
the road and get people's
reaction to the.
Thank you for that madam chair
and and Mr center off.
I think for you the legislation
that was passed that created the
committee.
specifically had.
You know this has the intent was
that and I can imagine madam
chair and I know that's a tough
question for yet for you to
answer Mr center off but it
makes it sound as if the words
of the committee did didn't take
that into into account and I
know that the work of the
committee did take into account
communities of interest as a
matter of fact that at the
beginning of each presentation.
As a as the committee went to a
community specifically made the
point that we took into account
communities of interest and
native American Hispanic
communities in particular were
mentioned several times across
the state in the different
committees that's all I'm trying
to get to is that it makes it
sound as if for some reason.
That the maps that you
presented.
And take those.
To communities of interest into
account and I'm and I.
What was stated in those
communities by the chairman is
not accurate that when you.
Presented those for
maps.
That communities of interest
were not taken into account of
the work they were specifically
mentioned several times that
that was what you put the effort
was so
Madam.
Share and Mr sent off none of
the folks who presented maps.
Have the mandate that the
committee had which was to be
fair.
To avoid things like compaction.
And so you mentioned just a
second ago Mr center off of that
where you're working under was
not jest.
Standard.
The madam chair up until the the
legislation was passed we didn't
realize we pass that that it had
been expanded to a ten percent
deviation quest before in law.
It had always been a five
percent plus or minus is that is
that accurate or is that an
accurate Mr center of it may be
an accurate I think a two
different issues
The statute to lay out the
principles that the C. R. C.
should take into account and if
you read the statute of talk
talk's about eight ten items the
C. R. C. shall do these things
then there's one item that they
made to.
And then there are two items
that they may not do.
So when the public started
drawing their own plans and
putting it on the gallery.
Many of those gallery plans did
not subscribe by Sears the rules
and so they were ignored by the
state or see if somebody do a
plan that had a population
deviation of plus twenty percent
and and I think just as have
just even try to write some of
those and tell them to to fix.
So many plans that were drawn by
the public were not considered
others were seriously considered
if they do to subscribe by the
statute of what the C. or C.
shall require
and and and and and many of them
did and many of them they did
not do it a second part to that
question yes the plus or minus
five percent to my knowledge
that was in the guidelines that
the legislature set through the
Legisla- the L. LFC for the the
Legislative Council Service ten
years ago twenty years ago laid
out certain guidelines that
included the plus or minus five
with that was never in the
statute to my knowledge thank
you madam chair so Mister center
of.
Was.
What was the policy for a
partial map I thought you were
not supposed to consider a
partial map it needed to be
entire state map is that
accurate is that an accurate.
Madam chair representative
latoya.
In the first round of staff.
anybody could put anything on
the gallery they could make
comments they can make
complaints they could speak to
what they see from other plans
and they can even drop partial
plans someone would say this is
my version of the international
district this is my version of
Rio Rancho please keep it
together them as this as the
process progressed in the C. or
C. was considering statewide
plans everyone realized
everybody could draw the most
perfect neighborhood for
themselves but you have to put
it with the whole region the
whole state and then the P. C.
R. C. started looking at full
plans.
Madam chair and Mr center off of
the first meeting that I
attended of that the the
committee was in Farmington it
was brought up that the
committee would not consider
partial plans.
Because the state didn't
consider all of the other
districts so I was really
surprised when one of the plans
that was pushed forward
literally was just a portion of
the plan so that's just concern
amended time I just ask you to
just make the statement and that
is.
The reason that the suggestion
of partisanship is being brought
up is because of Mr etcetera I
know you and in Farmington when
Hey there was some discussion of
that and the and the some of the
native American of bills were
being discussed and I have
several rhetorical questions one
of the questions that I asked
was.
Some of the maps seem to be
coming with an assumption.
And that is if somebody is not
exactly like me.
Doesn't even hold my same
political beliefs that they
can't represent me.
And so I asked rhetorically.
Can someone who's not.
Eight of American Representative
a native American.
Can someone who's not.
A Democrat.
Representative a native American
or Hispanic.
And the reason that the
question that's been brought
here of partisanship.
Is fitting.
Is one of the.
folks that was there to speak on
the native American maps got up
and specifically said.
I'd support these other maps
specifically because.
To answer Representative Montoya
is rhetorical question no.
If you're native American.
A Republican cannot represent
you.
Now.
Madam chair.
And community members who are
here.
That's a problem.
That's a huge problem because
there's a whole number of native
Americans were registered
Republican including my own
family my wife my children my
mother in law of the extended
family.
And so the idea that was
presented was I'm supporting.
Things native American versions
because.
It means more Democrats will be
elected.
So it doesn't matter what
Princeton says it doesn't matter
what anybody else who is a paid
to the to paid to come in and
say please stand for this and
approve it as being nonpartisan
but the folks that can just
spoken that was not the only
person who responded that there
was another gentleman who the is
was responding from Gallup I
believe and specifically made
the same point.
That if you're native American.
Republicans can not represent
your interests so that's that's
why.
Knowing that and by the way that
was the sponsor of the Navajo
redistricting concept I believe
it was J..
S. I. R. J. and so madam madam
chair and and and and Mr sent
off.
That's a problem they
specifically said this in
committee.
Not I wasn't everybody.
Once again come come to mind
there are a.
There are tens of thousands of
native Americans were registered
Republican.
And one who a recently served in
this body and in house district
for and the idea of the folks
who presented those maps
basically stated I'm supporting
these maps because it means a
Republican can't have a chance
to win that district.
So
that's why and that's why this
question participants come up on
the maps have been presented and
I don't know I don't know how
the committee could have missed
the very those blatant
statements.
That were presented by people
who are supporting those maps so
thank you madam chair I think
about Mr center faster respond
but I believe there's another
one on another person more.
Madam chair representative
Andrea I recall those two
comments I recall them saying
it.
And those are their opinions.
But the essence of the voting
rights act is that native
Americans still have an
opportunity to elect a candidate
of their choice not Democrats
not Republicans not even native
American the law doesn't look at
native American selecting native
Americans it looks at them and
Hispanics it allows them and it
it it gives them an opportunity
to elect a candidate of their
choice even if that is not based
on their race or their party the
law protects that even though of
those individuals I agree with
you said what they did to madam
chair that's the point the folks
who are registered Republicans
did not hold that view and did
not and would not have supported
those maps because they had a
purpose thank you madam chair.
Next we have Representative
heard of.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you members for your testimony
today we're for question and
you've gone through this in the
beginning I apologize can you
walk me through everybody that
was on the commission once again
please and their names.
Thank you Sir thank you madam
chair representative
Representative Fajardo is
in the beginning I did set out
and if you look at the website
biographies of every single one
of the members of the committee
are mentioned but are chair was
chosen by the ethics commission
that his former Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court if Chavis of.
In been handed to members are
chosen by Republican members of
the legislature in the house and
that was Ryan can to Lucy and
Chris.
Then there were two members that
were chosen the five membership
in the Democratic Party and that
one's a honorable medical
sciences in.
And then the state ethics
commission how the interviews
and ended up cations with
interviews
to the two people that are not
members of either major party.
They're both independents and
one was
So many been appointed in the
state more for I also the
governor Martinez in by the
current governor.
Is a person that works in.
Mexico on economics and
statistics.
More from professionally and
that was read again in Watkins
senses.
Committees of the civil
engineering held other positions
in organizing is a math teacher
at south valley academy in so
that's are seven members.
Thank you for that and out of
the seven them members how many
or either currently elected or
formally elected to the
legislative body.
Alex the modest no one is
currently elected no one is
currently.
And in fact you have to be a
distance from elections even of
a and so the only elective
person because frankly I'm
disappointed was senator former
senator Michael Sanchez okay so
we have to members that were on
the commission that are former
US state senators is that
correct.
That is a yes yes and the party
affiliation of those two
members.
We were both Democrats okay so I
bring this up because this is a
concern you actually on the
commission you have to former
elected that are actually in
charge of redistricting former.
the states that they held one
particular server for over
twenty years and earlier E.
there was a conversation that
you had no knowledge of seats no
knowledge part partisanship but
when you serve in the seeds.
You know that districts you know
those numbers so I just want to
make a point that we do we had
two former on the elected's who
sat in Spain sat in the Senate
who helped make these decisions
so thank you madam chair.
Thank you and that concludes all
of the questions from the house
members and again I just want to
thank everyone hear today for
all of your hard work it doesn't
go and recognized and I think
that the folks that did
participated via an persons or
online and letters you know none
of them are turned away and I am
just grateful that you all gave
them that opportunity to be
heard we do not have time to go
through the PVC maps so we're
going to conclude this
presentation again thank you for
your time.
