Representative Chandler come in
Representative Chandler.
Gentlelady from Los Alamos.
So sorry Mr speaker another faux
pas with the mute button.
I am ready Mr speaker will you
get me to that point certainly
that the record reflect all
action necessary for the house
bill one oh wait on final
passage is been taken gentlelady
to explain it all.
thank you Mr speaker I am here
to talk about house bill one
await it relates to the state
solid waste program and just to
remind people the state solid
waste program offers essential
services to support the safe
safe operational landfills these
services include permitting
training certifying solid waste
operators educating the public
on waste management of and
recycling administrating grants
to local communities inspections
and responding to complaints of
illegal dumping.
Permit fees are required for
landfill operators to operate
and I'm fees have not increased
since two thousand and seven
under current law operators rate
permit fees every twenty years
in those fees have been
insufficient to cover even one
F. T. in the program.
Bill changes the methodology
methodology by which the
department charge it's
permitting fees fees will be
developed through rule making
consistent with parameters that
are set forth in a floor
amendment I will be proposing
and Mr speaker can you guide me
shall I talk about the floor
amendment now I think it would
have impact on the bodies
understanding of the bill.
Only has been passed out so is
generally wishes to move it
please give us the to to number
and we'll discuss the amendment.
the two oh two number is two two
zero zero eight zero point one.
And if I may be gentlelady to
explain the amendment.
Thank you Mr speaker Mr speaker
the amendment imposes a fee cap
of five thousand dollars per
year and it also requires and to
the tiered structure with the
lower tier up fine to facilities
serving and located in a city or
county with fewer than fifteen
thousand people and I would like
to emphasize Mr speaker that
this particular amendment was
negotiated with the minutes
fully and some of the private
operators of landfills in the
state and I've been authorized
to say that the municipally now
supports this bill with this
ammendment Mr speaker.
Okay is there discussion on the
amendment the gentle lady from
Chavis Representative Ezzell.
Mr speaker thank you very much
will the lady place.
Mr speaker I gladly yield to the
lady from Travis county.
Mr speaker gentle lady how many.
Whenever your amendment says
services city or county with a
population of fifteen thousand
or or fewer fund as the number
of those two do you know Mr
speaker gentle lady.
gentle lady Mr speaker I believe
it's a handful I would say it's
fewer than six and I'm going to
be calling my expert in a moment
but I think that's an accurate
number gentle lady Mr speaker.
Okay so the two tier.
The structure is only affecting
six.
Of these it and the rest of them
will be put in at the let's see.
Five thousand dollar range is
that correct.
There isn't generate you're on
mute.
The lady and Mr speaker
apologies the not quite
the lady the actual fees that
will be charge will be on
through a rulemaking process
that will involve the
stakeholders and the public
the cap is the maximum amount
that could be imposed through
the rule making process.
And Mr speaker gentle lady those
rules will come through to the
the environment department
didn't.
Mr speaker gentle lady of yes
through the III the
environmental improvement board
is my understanding of the
process gentle lady.
Mr speaker gentle lady and I
fall under the environment
department is that correct.
one moment if I might consult my
expert gentle lady.
In requests for folks to to
remove their jackets.
No objections.
All right it's fine rules are
suspended folks in their
jackets.
And only the jackets.
Mr speaker gentle lady up for
the record I am consulting with
an expert her name is Stephanie
stringer and Stephanie is the
resource protection division
director and I just Astor about
the E. I do the I. B. is a board
that is independent it is
administered in a and
administrative ways through the
Environment Department however
Mr speaker gentle lady it is an
independent boards whose members
are appointed by the governor.
And Mr speaker gentle lady said
that this is the environmental
improvement board.
Mr speaker gentle lady yes.
And the lady that you're
conversing with the Stephanie at
did not catch your last name Mr
speaker gentle lady I apologize.
Mr speaker gentle lady Stephanie
stringer she's the resource
protection division director.
Okay Mister speaker gentle lady
I was just kind of curious
because I'd.
I know the two counties that
might qualify with population of
fifteen thousand or fewer but it
says a city or a county with a
population of fifteen thousand
or fewer so if you were a city.
With in that county which you
qualify Mr speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker gentle lady I believe
so but let me just confirm.
Mr speaker gentle lady yes.
Okay Mister speaker that does
answer my question on the
amendment I do have questions
about the bill later on thank
you very much gentle lady.
Thank you.
This further debate the
gentleman from Lee
Representative Scott.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady from also watch you.
Mr speaker and gentleman I
gladly yield to the to you from
the county.
When we heard this in energy's a
maximum state of was on the
order of levels ten thousand
dollars is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
correct over a twenty year
period.
This little bit of confusion
here.
It has been a single payment of
ten thousand dollars over twenty
year period is that correct just
one payment when the application
was made.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Lee that is correct.
Speaker gentle lady this this
legislation commanded will raise
that to a maximum of five
thousand dollars annually is
that correct.
Mr speaker a gentleman that's
correct.
What is.
The point of the bill they
discuss on.
The needs of the environment
department with respect to those
are costs associated with
inspections if those rise above
five thousand dollars.
One still apply.
Mr speaker one yes those still
apply the Environment Department
would need to absorb those costs
through its through other
funding mechanisms such as it's
general appropriation.
Mr speaker gentle lady all of
reserve comments on that part of
the main point of bill until
later thank you Mr speaker thank
you Jim.
Gentleman from San Juan
Representative going thank you
Mr speaker to the gentle lady
from Los Alamos Three Rivers
Center following San Juan Santa
Fe yield.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
San Juan yes I will yield.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady depreciate the
minute I I think that it it does
help.
relieve some of the burning on
these facilities.
Of my first question on the the
amendment itself is I think
you'll have a lot of landfills
is my understanding that will
have separate contracts with
both the county and municipality
and they service both of those
customers so when you talk about
a city or county with a
population of fifteen thousand
or fewer.
And I as a landfill have
separate contracts in one of
those contracts not actually be
with the municipality that has
fewer than fifteen thousand
residents so does that put me
into that lower tier.
a gentleman thank you for that
question let me consult with my
experts.
Mr speaker gentleman from San
Juan I believe if I understand
the question and my experts
understands the question we we
believe they would fall in the
lower tier.
Mr speaker gentle lady thank you
so limiting sometimes it helps
for us just have a concrete
example so I I I feel from San
Juan County and there is one of
landfill there that's operated
by waste management and they
have separate contracts with San
Juan County and a separate
contract with the city of Austin
for example and so my concern is
since they have a landfill that
that covers San Juan county in
San Juan county is this the
greater in population and
fifteen thousand.
So is that going to mean that
the the rate payers an aspect
are going to be subject to the
higher tier even though the city
of aspect is fewer than fifteen
thousand people.
If I may consult my expert Mr
speaker.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
It's our understanding that it
is the facility that is charged
and if the facility is located
in the smaller populated area it
would be charged at the lower
tier.
Mr speaker gentle lady so the
fact that
Like for example waste
management facility and San Juan
county it is in the
unincorporated part of the
county it does service account
of us more than fifteen thousand
so does that mean it will
therefore be in the higher tier
even though it also services
under a separate contract
municipality that is lower than
fifteen thousand.
Mr speaker gentleman again I
will consult with my next.
Mr speaker and gentleman up for
answer continues to be it would
be at the lower tier.
Mr speaker gentle lady thank you
for that clarification I think
that does help the the other
question I had is the where I
read this amendment is that it
puts a hard cap of five thousand
per year regardless of whether
you're in the upper tier or the
lower tiers are correct.
Mr speaker a gentleman that's
correct.
And Mr speaker gentle lady I I
also notice as I read this
amendment and in with the other
changes the statute this bill
would make it also provides the
possibility of inflation
increases over time so what I'm
unclear about Mr speaker gentle
lady is the five thousand dollar
hard cap is that number itself
subject to inflation.
Miss Mister speaker a gentleman
no it is not so it is a hard cap
of five thousand dollars Mr
speaker and gentleman from San
Juan.
Mr speaker gentle lady thank you
for for the conversation
clarification clarification does
help me understand this bill
better thank you.
Thank you for those questions
these are for the debate on the
amendment.
Is there objection to it.
Hey nine house floor amendment
number one to house bill one oh
nine is adopted.
Gentility from was almost you
still have the floor.
Mr speaker I I think I've
explained the whole and I'm
happy to make a motion if you're
ready.
well and the motion is been
made.
Of these there is debate the
gentleman from Chavis Eddy and
Otero.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
that was a good try you almost
made it I I was working on it
there Florida's to floor leader.
A gentle lady will yield place I
will gladly yield you from.
Is that right.
Yes a great.
Thank you ma'am Mr speaker
gentle lady this is although
this has not.
As you described have not been
adjusted in a few years this is
a significant increase.
in permitting fees correct.
Miss Mister speaker gentle and
first of all it hasn't been
increased since two thousand
seven which I guess I would
disagree is a few years
and in terms of a sick
significant increase I can't
answer that question what I do
know Mr speaker and and
gentleman as the fees are
woefully inadequate for the
Environment Department to
administer a program that is
really essential to the state.
Mr speaker and gentle lady with
with with that comment do you
have a.
has the environment department
given you a document that shows
but the cost of them
administrating these premises.
Mr speaker to gentleman I do not
have such a document.
We can lady
I don't know of.
It appears to me.
That for the small communities.
And for.
Large waste facilities in rural
New Mexico.
That these these.
Are going to be substantially
higher and they will be forced
to of course raise their
disposal fees to their customers
to compensate for.
With the option.
I.
Mr speaker gentle lady I I I see
a continuing thing that I I've
seen that I'm I I it's kind of
trouble some to me that many of
these departments including
Environment Department.
Yes
Generating significant increase
in their revenues operating
expense.
At the cost of the permanent of
of our general fund because the
speech no longer will go to the
general fund they will go
directly to the department is
that correct.
Up.
Mr speaker and gentleman they
will go to a fund within the
department's budget
designated for administering
this program and Mr speaker
gentleman I might supplement my
answer up the reason I think
you're seeing these these kinds
of bills from from the
environment department and
perhaps other departments is LFC
and DFA have been encouraging
These departments to come to to
suggest he increases that
adequately provide for the
programs that the administering
Mr speaker and gentleman.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I've
heard some of that but I've also
seen that the bass Department
budgets presented to House
Appropriations and LFC has not
seen a corresponding decrease is
that correct.
Mr speaker I can't answer that
specifically it may be correct
it does not change the fact that
the program is not adequately
funded and that the fees that
they're charging are not
adequately providing for
administering of an important
program that helps protect the
environment and groundwater in
the state Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Well gentle lady most of these
Disposal sites are in place.
Most of them have been permitted
to where groundwater is not.
A issue that's part of the
process to get one permitted at
a location so.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
It appears to me.
That if the department is going
to increase their the
substantially.
And it has been at.
A
it and they have been operating
at a deficit that there would be
some document Mr speaker and
gentle lady that we could
present to the body to to.
Verify this significant increase
in permitting fees I mean we're
going from a one timer for
twenty year.
the to a five thousand dollar
annual fee
And that's that that's a
significant difference and I'm
just trying to get my arms are
round.
Why.
Other than to a statement that
says it's been woefully at
inadequate.
Mr speaker gentleman in my
opening remarks I indicated that
the current fee schedule fails
to even support one F. T. E. and
in this program so that is
information that has been made
available to you in terms of
documentation I'm on aware that
one one comes to the floor that
it has become an evidentiary
proceeding this bill has gone
through to committees in which
the subject matter experts for
available for
Just sitting and yes I was Mr
speaker and gentleman and that
information was provided then
and it continues to be provided
this body Mr speaker John.
Thank you for that the gentle
lady Mr speaker there are
according to the analysis and
I'm looking at their three
hundred forty five entities that
will be paying about five
thousand dollars piece and that
total is going now he called
about two point seven million
dollar.
So it's a significant increase
for the department
and a two point seven what is
the total
If you have it
your expert what's the total
budget for them Environment
Department currently.
Mr speaker.
My experts.
Does not have the budget for the
entire department but she tells
me that for her division which
includes four bureaus her budget
is twenty five million dollars.
Thank you gentle lady so this is
about a ten percent increase to
her budget processes to point
six seven million dollars seems
like
For a department.
Is is busy is our environment
department is that.
A ten percent increase in
revenue just from this one bill
and there have been others that
there would have been on a
reduction in the overall budget
that was presented to.
House Appropriations so that's
one concern
gentlelady
On
Hold on just a minute left my
computer.
July's I look to your bill there
are no other
Regulatory impacts to these
permits other than an increase
in the of that right there's no
there's no difference in the
operation of these facilities
correct.
Mr speaker
I'm not sure I understood I'm
not sure I understand the
question.
In my question very simply Mr
speaker and gentle lady is in
addition to the increase in
their fees are that will there
be any other increased operating
expenses that these facilities
will anchor but because of this
legislation.
Mr speaker John thank you for
that clarification now.
Thank you gentle lady for your
time.
Next to the gentleman from Lee
Representative Scott.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady from Los Alamos
yield once again.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Lee I gladly yield.
Speaker gentle lady you have to
you have to mow you made me
smile with your effort to.
Move your bill for.
Move your bill for passage but
just a couple of questions if
you don't mind.
Mr speaker gentle lady blue
devils Representative committee.
That the environment department
has been able to cover the cost
of their inspections of these
various facilities and that has
been coming out of their general
operating budget is that
correct.
Think it's correct Mr speaker
and gentleman I believe that's
correct.
Speaker gentle lady can you tell
me
these inspections occur at every
facility annually current once
in a while and as a corollary to
that question.
Are there are problems that have
been identified.
That
the lack of resources.
Exacerbated the issue.
Mr speaker thank you for that
question look let me touch base
with my expert.
Jeez the answer that I received
from my expert with they do not
have sufficient resources to
inspect the facilities at a
frequency and at a level that
they feel that they need to.
Miss.
Thank you for that have they
identified as a consequence of
the inspections are conducting
whether and how many if there
are any problems.
One moment.
Mr speaker and gentleman I've
been advised that there are
complete they have found
compliance issues but she
doesn't have that my expertise
not have numbers or specifics
with her at this time.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
Currently they consider the
problem so it's veremos to.
warrant this.
Very substantial increase in the
fee structure.
Yes my problem is.
We don't know today.
Whether we have a problem.
It just looks like it's
possible.
Destry increases current.
Perhaps.
For.
One of inspections.
But believe us all in the.
Committee documentation that
we're looking to raise somewhere
around five hundred thousand
dollars.
Immediately upon passage of this
legislation and M. according to
of the gentleman from.
From Travis Etienne Otero could
raise substantially more than
that it seems
it seems excessive to me gentle
lady could you respond to that.
Mr speaker I have a number and
gentlemen I have a number of
responses for that first
as previously noted the fee
structure that currently exists
does not sufficiently cover the
program it does not even pay for
one F. T. E. so I'm I'm a little
perplexed about tying it to how
many inspections have occurred
and whether or not those
inspections have have
illuminated problems at various
facilities the issue here is
that the program cannot support
what is necessary to determine
whether there are problems at
facilities and secondly there is
more to the program than just
inspections there's a litany of
responsibilities that this
particular program has including
educating I went through them
and my introduction training and
certifying waste operators
educating the public on waste
management and recycling
granting requests to the
administering grants to local
communities etcetera so I thank
you the premise Mr speaker and
gentleman that this is simply an
inspection program is is
misplaced thank you Mr speaker
and gentleman for that question.
Speaker gentle lady could you
describe in terms of percentages
how much of this increase would
be allocated to inspections and
how much to all of these other
activities.
Mr speaker gentleman give me one
moment please.
Mr speaker gentleman I'm not
able to give you that right at
this point.
And Mr speaker and gentleman I
don't believe the half a million
dollars that was originally to
address will be covered by this
fee increase in its entirety.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
to want to do for your answers.
This further debate the
gentleman from Chavis
Representative you sell.
Mr speaker will the gentle lady
of please.
Mr speaker and gentle lady from
Travis I gladly you.
Mr speaker gentle lady thank you
very much
I'm going over here the question
I have several questions I have
for you.
And one of them Representative
Scott answered in your expert
witness could not answer and
that was the additional
services.
What is what is it fire minerals
what is supposed to call the
environmental improvement for
doing as far as.
Close land feels good of.
Can you answer that question for
you me Mr speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker gentle lady give me a
moment consult.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
Closed landfills certainly you
know retired landfills gentle
lady Mr speaker I'm not charged
a fee but they are monitored by
the Department.
And Mr speaker gentle lady
whenever your mom saying
monitored on the setting that
they're using some sort of
device to drill down to to
figure out what is going on
below the surface is that
correct Mr speaker gentle lady
Mr speaker gentle I that's a
really good question let me
consult.
Mr speaker gentle lady correct.
Okay Mister speaker gentle lady
of.
What is the environmental
improvement board doing because
I am seeing what is going to
happen next and I will be the
one that's going to be
responsible for what will be
happening next with these be
increased what about any illegal
dumping.
Mr speaker gentle lady just to
clarify are you asking will
there be enhanced enforcement of
the law on illegal dumping and
and that sort of thing is that
what your question is gentle
lady Mr speaker.
Well madam speaker and gentle
lady.
Whenever people do dump
illegally they want to make sure
nobody's watching so how can
they monitor anybody that is
dumping illegally I mean that's
kind of a no brainer right there
they are not dumping for anybody
could see and that the effects
of where they're dumping does
have a negative effect and it
does affect those people that
are living in the rural areas of
our counties so I really have a
problem whenever we have the
environmental improvement board
that wants to increase fees that
is now going to be a burden put
on me and I stayed just out of
the experiences we've had to
face many years ago the little
village of lake Arthur which is
Representative Rubio's hometown
there was all sorts of illegal
dumping going on over there
it was it got to be very very
bad so people started calling
all their junk and trash down
to.
A little drop called will not
draw.
M. the madam speaker and gentle
lady.
In the walnut drive ran between
two forms and I'm very familiar
with both of these farms and the
farmers at that time.
That got a call and a visit from
the environmental board saying
you have to clean up that mess
otherwise we will start off
you're fine at five thousand
dollars each these two farmers
had nothing to do with it it was
not even on their property yet
they were mandated by the
environmental board to clean it
up so Mister speaker gentle
Madam speaker and gentle lady
whether we're talking about
increase in these fees I also
see illegal dumping becoming
more prevalent in our rural
areas at work where I live and
it is right out in the middle of
nowhere we have refrigerators
dumped alongside the road all
sorts of trash dumped alongside
the road Mr and the tree waste
dumped along side of the road
and guess what.
We are the ones that generally
end up cleaning this mess up so
I see it becoming a burden on us
whenever we are talking about.
The New Mexico environment
department's budget they already
have a really hefty budget Mr
speaker and gentle lady and the.
The budget for the solid waste
Burke bureau right now is
approximately two million
dollars in the budget for the
solid waste permitting
permitting is five hundred
thousand dollars a year so
whenever you figure out.
Three hundred forty five into
entities that are paid five
thousand dollars each year that
takes a budget increase from
five hundred thousand dollars
two two million six hundred and
seventy thousand dollars.
If that was the case if this
bill passes should LESC be
notified that maybe there needs
to be a to a budget adjustment
done for the do I do or the
environment department itself.
Mr speaker gentle lady the
environment department in my
does not receive adequate
funding for you all of its
programs adequately there is no
I do not expected for should be
any request to lower their
budget and indeed I believe
there budget should be increased
and then there's huge
responsibilities that we ask
them to perform.
Well Mister Smith Adam speaker
gentle lady Thatcher opinion and
mine is totally the opposite I
think we have to wait over
funded the environment
department in light of all the
negative things that they have
done to harm businesses
throughout our statement of are
both small businesses have been
shattered because they have been
deemed non essential for the
past year Madam speaker and
gentle lady whenever I see that
we are going to I don't know
increase these fees and those
fees will be passed on to those
people that do use these
dumpsites.
Whenever that starts happening
whenever those fees are
increasing should I be calling
the environment improvement
board to come pick up all the
crap that has been done to open
up and down every roled wrote in
my County is that what we're
going going to do.
If I say I want something done
about it now are they gonna hop
to that test that I've called
about Madam speaker and gentle
lady.
Mr speaker gentle lady now.
Did M. Madam speaker and gentle
lady it's got to be up to me to
clean up that mess it at me and
my neighbors are one more time
we're going to have to clean it
up and because we live out in
the county we're going to have
to hold it all the way in to the
city land field and therefore we
are going to be charge that fee
to dump this stuff that was
dumped illegally out in our
backyards so madam speaker and
gentle lady of this is just
another way to increase.
Taxes to increase fees on the
citizens of our state Madam
speaker gentle lady that's all
the questions I have thank you
for your responses thank you for
those questions and letting.
There's further debate and the
chair recognizes the gentleman
from Lee County Representative
Pettigrew.
Thank you madam chair does the
gentle lady from all those can
you.
miss madam speaker and gentleman
from Lee I'd gladly you.
Thank you.
What that figure and gentle lady
when I first saw this on the for
calendar weaker to back.
I started.
The significant amount of
research on this and reaching
out to all of the different
landfill people that I know
across the state.
One of the the resonating
stories I heard from each and
every person I talked to I don't
know probably ten landfills.
of the twenty two that are
permitted.
Speaker gentle lady was a
frustration that they were not
brought to the table with
respect to this bill every one
of them was surprised with this
bill okay.
In and madam speaker and gentle
lady if you.
Walk me through why that might
be or why that's the case why
were the very people that this
bill facts not brought to the
table.
Mr speaker gentleman I
truthfully I'm not.
R. J. Madam speaker and
gentleman I'm not sure I
understand what you mean I'm
aware of multiple conversations
by the department with various
stakeholders including as I
mentioned earlier in my remarks
the minutes fully and some of
the larger operators and some of
the smaller operators and and
Madam speaker in addition I
would note at the rulemaking
process is also another
mechanism to engage stakeholders
and if this bill passes that
will be an important part of the
developing of this fee structure
Madam speaker John.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady the R. we'll get to
the rule making here in a minute
I'm gonna read you a quote from
the fact that the City of
Albuquerque and just gone
through a contentious rate
increase in the last six months
without the knowledge of this
impeding increase raises
significant concerns.
So she about you have no clue
this is.
We can.
Solid waste authority won't
we're probably numbers five or
six and I am buying generators
in the state.
We're not brought to the table
on the cedar and so I'm not
going to debate whether or not
we
you did have R. the bill writers
had stakeholders involved with
this I'm gonna say that two very
large ones out there had no
clue.
And so with that madam speaker
that that's concerning for me
the the other thing that was
very prevalent in our
conversations not a single one
of them the landfill operators
the right option.
Debated whether or not madam
speaker and gentle lady that an
increase was necessary.
In.
Specifically you know one of the
operators who just completed
their.
The permit renewal.
And ending knowledge is the fact
that it probably costs the state
at that point in time more than
half of that ten thousand
dollars just to get through the
permit renewal peace and so
everyone of them out there madam
speaker and gentle lady are in
agreement with this the the
right removal.
For a right an annual rate would
be something that that would be
good for the.
For the department.
They're just again frustrated
that they didn't get to be part
of this discussion and I and
madam speaker and gentle lady I
appreciate the the amendment
that you brought in this that
that captures the the annual
rate.
The concern of speaker and
gentle lady that I have with
that specifically is the fact
that there's no equity in that
right.
So it doesn't that that that
rate is not based off of
volume are size and I understand
teacher system in that the third
it doesn't show in any way to
address equity from a small
operator to a large operator
would you agree with that madam
speaker and gentle lady.
I'm.
Madam speaker gentleman now.
Okay
figure gentle lady please
clarify.
Mr speaker I mean Madam speaker
and and and gentleman the rule
making process and the
parameters that are set through
this bill is not eliminate the
ability of the EIB to consider
other factors in addition to the
ones that are indebted in the
legislation things like size of
the facility and other elements
would be part of the process and
and madam speaker.
Thank you for that response but
speaker
so as we keep going back
rulemaking as I I do understand
rulemaking process will be there
and and I will be watching very
closely to make sure that that
we do have a significant amount
of public and private entity
feedback with respect to that
people at the table
To to make sure that we're
protecting our citizens as much
as we're protecting our solemn
wishes owns.
The other thing that I wanted to
to bring up madam speaker and
gentle lady is that again.
The.
Very entities that
this bill.
Will tax.
Call it what it is it's a tax.
Want to continue and what what
that relationship with NMED we
want to continue that they have
huge concerns with the way that
the phone with Spiro
as as separate naturally for
years and and and so when when I
when I say madam speaker and
gentle lady that
the.
Each of these operators agree
that there needs to be a fee
associated with this they want
to make sure solid waste bureau
remains a viable.
part of the state and then
mainly because they have
concerns over how the the people
and and Washington DC revenue
EPA and so they they feel like
they have a better relationship
with our state people and they
are highly concerned about.
Some of those people in in DC
look at things and so I I want
to.
Again this will reiterate.
No there were no negative
comments from the facilities.
With respect to whether or not
with respect NMED with respect
to this always bureau or with
respect to the fact that we need
to.
We we do need to to to see and
encourage we do need to have a
way to make sure that this the
state viable there again their
largest there are there one of
the primary complaint was what
did they just come to us wanting
the brings to the table wanted
to have this conversation I have
an email from zoom loin that was
done on federal workforce which
is after.
All of this she started taking
place and so it's just a
continual frustration from them
they feel like they have a good
relationship with with with the
department and and then the
department chose not right to
them and and help them be part
of the solution instead of going
through.
this legislation that's what I
would rather through the whole
process been there to be able to
speak in support of.
And I know you have some people
are what I've gone back to
listen to the to the Zune
meetings.
Madam speaker and gentle lady.
some people did speak in support
of this other system speak and
and and so
I I also want to recognize the
fact that that come back in a a
group.
We got three were three books at
the beginning session and all
the budget information.
And so I went back in and read
the book and actually volume to.
LOC actually did make a
recommendation on the bookish
year on page two seventy four
that.
These rating that these taxes
these rates need to happen to
prevent future increases.
And then I went back into the
two thousand nineteen books two
thousand twenty books and the
same statement was in there
again.
I couldn't find anything before
that now we're gonna go upstairs
Moines live to to get the the
older books to see how many how
many years LFC has been
recommending this on the budget.
So again I think the intent
behind this has has is good
natured I just there's the fact
that we didn't bring our
stakeholders to the table.
is is continuing concerning for
me
The other thing and I talked
with the budget writers but that
up in with the LFC and this is
something that I want to make
very clear.
I asked them.
With this.
Tax.
The expected revenue.
will they expect to see smaller
budgets in the coming years and
the answer was very clearly and
very pointedly yes.
So I will be watching for that
and in two thousand twenty
twenty two.
And I'll be watching for that
two thousand twenty three
because I I do expect.
that we're gonna do this we're
gonna we're gonna gain these
revenues and we're not again
we're not whether this needs to
happen.
But what we don't want to do is
we don't want to see a continual
increase in their budget knocked
down back and look at the but
just to see how the solid waste
budget has increased over the
years this right here should put
a stop to that.
LFC agrees with me early C.
Ellis that I've talked to that
wrote that part of the of the
budget agreed with me so I look
forward to seeing and in a I'm
sure your your bill madam chair
and thank you know it is going
to pass
there will be opposition to it I
will be one of those but
I'm sure your bill will pass can
continue on to the Senate but I
do think this will be something
those are my target this on my a
much.
In my sights for twenty twenty
to twenty twenty three to make
sure that appropriations doesn't
do consider considers very
strongly.
How much revenue this is
bringing them when they're
looking at how much the state
needs to continue to the budget
for that with that madam speaker
and gentle lady I yield back
thank you.
There's further debate the
gentleman from curry
Representative Crowder.
Thank you Mr speaker the gentle
lady from Los Alamos please
here.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
curry county I yield.
Thank you gentle lady.
So late at night like to kinda
do this summer just to make sure
I'm thinking clear as I
understand it they're they're
striking the language used to
cap it at ten thousand dollar
cap is that right they're
striking that language.
Mr speaker gentleman correct.
Okay that was to buy a permit
and I understand those permits
were about a twenty year permit
is that right gentle lady Mr
speaker.
Mr speaker and gentleman
correct.
Okay so that would be.
About a five hundred dollar per
year cost and now we're going to
five thousand so revenue
basically a thousand percent
increase I guess.
Is that right jollity.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
two thousand and seven that's
correct.
Okay I just want to make sure I
was understanding that this is
the impact to the cities based
on what they have paid recently.
Is is gonna be here regardless
of two thousand seven if they
just bought their permit for
the next twenty years then this
is gonna be very impactful I
believe and that's part of my
question if they have just
bought a new permit for the
landfill for another twenty
years does this new the schedule
going to place immediately or
does it come into effect.
When they're permit is expired
at the end of the twenty year
period.
Mr speaker John thanks for the
question that's a good question
you gonna consult my expert.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
Just a few clarifying points
there is no fees yet identified
recall that it is a five
thousand dollar cap actual fee
will be set Mr speaker and
gentleman through the E. ID
rulemaking process in which
stakeholders and others will be
involved just your question now
not just to someone who's just
purchased a permit or paid for
permit or renew their permit
what however one wants to refer
to it Mr speaker gentleman they
would the they we anticipate
that they would be subject to
the rule of course that's part
of the rule making process and
if they were subject to the rule
making process they would get a
credit for whatever monies they
had paid you know in terms of
the twenty year period Mr
speaker John I hope I was clear.
so generally Mr speaker what I
would understand that to me is
that we're pro rate the ballots
and refunded is that correct of
the of the ten thousand dollar
fee the rate.
Mr speaker gentleman I think
that's a fair way to describe it
okay thank you generally
appreciate the
I have talked to my local
folks on their landfill in the
in the area that I live in the
first question is how the world
we budget for this if they
haven't made the rules we don't
know what the fees are going to
be how do we budget for this and
how do we know how to set rates
for the ratepayers in a
community that we are going to
have to reimburse us as we
reimburse the state so it is
there any top of how the the
structuring would take place is
it gonna be phased in as a going
to be just a cliff impactor has
that been working late you have
any idea Mr speaker and
gentleman let me see if I can
get an idea.
Mr speaker and gentleman I think
you're your question had within
it answers which is yes in the
expectation is for them the
process of working with
stakeholders there will be the
ability to phase in fees to
delay implementation so that
budgets and and so on Mr speaker
and gentleman can be adjusted.
Okay thank you generally won't
proceed that so generally I
think this most of my questions
I I did have an email that came
in several days ago and
anticipate the counter naked
Fund email no song this after
for goes questions but I do want
to make a comment on on a remark
you made that this happened in
two thousand seven as the last
the increase in is woefully
short I believe for your words
of how.
The environment department's be
impacted but yet when I look in
in volume three of the financial
books I can see that.
The New Mexico environment
department transferred forty
seven million six hundred and
thirty eight thousand four
hundred dollars out of the
personal service employee
benefits to another.
Purpose don't know what the
purpose was.
And also I can look at their
cash balances as of November
twenty was thirty five million
for the six thousand fourteen
dollars.
And November twenty twenty
November nineteen with thirty
eight million seven hundred
sixty five thousand dollars.
And so gentle lady I I'm
curious.
If if it was so woefully short
when they were making these
payments other whenever these
kind of cash balances in the
department.
Mr speaker John from curry I
believe I have focused all of my
comments and information to this
particular program I can't speak
to other programs that the
department is administering our
budget balances and other
departments what I believe I
said Mr speaker and gentleman is
the fee structure that is in
currently in place can not pay
for even one FTE in this program
I think that's what I said and
I cannot go beyond answering
that question other than what I
just said Mr speaker John.
Very sure answer generated thank
you for that I appreciate it I I
just
I know that the department has
more authority to transfer funds
about.
In all the departments do but
when I see those kind of
balances cash balances and in
HSD.
it causes me to pause so I
appreciate you let me have a
little bit more time thank you
gently thank you Mr speaker.
There's further debate the
gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln Representative Nibert.
Thank you Mr speaker real gentle
lady from Los Alamos County you.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Chavis and Lincoln I gladly
yield.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady I really appreciate
the amendment that you put on
earlier that provided for the
five thousand dollar limitation
and that I had a few questions
lined up before that amendment
and so I
had to.
Read that section down to
maybe go over the questions that
I did have and I think that the
amendment the really answers
most of those questions but I do
have a couple concerns Mr
speaker and gentle lady.
It looks like the two tier
system that that's contemplated
is going to
treat possibly regional
landfills differently than.
Landfills M. in sparsely
populated counties.
And there are several instances
where we may have several
sparsely populated counties and
still not get to that I of that
fifteen thousand people women
and I was wondering.
Is the agency going to take into
account of those factors in
determining a.
Of.
Appropriate schedule for them or
they locked into a to
As a two part school tour
schedule that would disregard
the population in multiple
counters that may be having and
regional landfill.
Mr speaker John give me one
moment to consult.
Mr speaker and gentleman I
believe with the two tier
structure it is going to be
difficult to maneuver within if
one falls within a particular to
here there's going to be a high
level of consistency I think
that's a fair way to describe it
Mr speaker John.
Mr speaker gentle lady I don't
know anything about the landfill
that's north of Lebanon but I
suspect it's a regional landfill
because Wagner madam can't
produce that amount of
The solemn wasted tied to a
landfill of that size but I
suspect it's maybe a regional
type landfills and if that is
the case I would suspect that
there's about fifteen thousand
people.
Him in that entire area and yet
we be imposing the higher of the
two fees on on that landfill and
it just
a
could be a significant
We're for for a landfill of that
sparsely populated area of the
to swallow
so I hope the agency will
consider some of those things
one man.
Impose these fees statewide and
and look at those sites my my
second question that remains
after after the amendment is
the.
There was a line of questioning
with the gentle lady from Travis
county that talk about close
sites and are there any fees
that are associated or.
Required of the department with
respect to closed landfills.
Mint Mr speaker gentleman let me
consult with my ex.
Mr speaker and gentleman of
there are no fees with up close
monitoring closed landfills.
So the entire program would be
funded through the fees that are
secured by by this particular
bill as well as maybe in the
general appropriations of the
state money made to the
department for those purposes.
Mr speaker and gentle lady Mr
speaker gentleman I think that's
a fair statement.
One one additional question
concerning closed landfill
sites.
Mr speaker and gentle lady to
your knowledge did does the
agency engaging and additional
monitoring for annual reviews of
those closed
landfill sites that are located
throughout the state.
Mr speaker and gentleman it
additional what I'm not sure I
know what the additional is I'm
sorry Mr speaker and does a
person from the agency get in
their car and go out to those
sites and look around or do they
do any drilling to try to
discover if there's any leaching
of fluids
do any monitoring with respect
to maybe
Groundwater or gashes
commissions from those sites is
does is it agency engage in any
activities with respect to those
old are I decided then but the
old.
Closed land sites and when I say
closed I mean that probably work
clothes pursuant to agency
regulations.
Mr speaker gentle and thanks for
that clarification give me one
moment.
Mr speaker gentle and yes at in
addition to the to the you know
the physical testing there they
do
go to facilities periodically to
to check on on their status.
And Mr speaker gentle lady the
funds that are utilized by the
department to engage in those
activities are those just
general fund.
Appropriations that we may to
the agency orders that have
sources of revenue that are
maybe specifically tied to a
program that deals with that.
Mr speaker and gentleman to the
Department relies on the general
there general fund
appropriation.
Mr speaker gentle lady thank you
for clarifying that the
again I I do really appreciate
the effort you made to get the
amendment on to to limit the
ability because I was concerned
in the first instance that if we
are going to have an open ended
rule that allowed the agency to
set fees that we again are
giving up some of the authority
of this body to the executive
branch to impose fees without
having those fees vetted by the
the legislature I still have
some concerns about the increase
of the the landfills are going
to and for but at least I'm
comforted that that we know what
the upper limit is and hopefully
the the environment department
will consider the population of
the state we're and setting for
us the the schedule fees and not
impose range of but only
Albuquerque could afford to to
pay because they can spread over
many more households van say
wagon mound
Mr speaker gentle lady thank you
for the debate.
Thank you for the questions this
further debate the gentleman
from San Juan Representative
Strickler.
Thank you Mr speaker with the
gentle lady from Los Alamos
please yield.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
San Juan I but we you.
Thank you gentle lady
I've had some some experience
and and raising fees and I know
how difficult it is gentle lady
several popular because
somebody's gonna have to pay for
and
Yeah I think what to.
What you're doing here if you're
you're raising the face ten
times and that's this this was
really
causing some concern
want when I've had to deal with
Faye increases it was a more
modest increases may be two
times but not ten times and I
think that's why the the city's
and county's suppose this issues
going on too far and I've
checked gentle lady Mr speaker
check with the mind my home
county San Juan County and and
the city of Farmington and and
and they're concerned about the
state increase and I understand
your point earlier that you want
to make sure there's enough the
funds the fees to cover the
testing and what not let me give
you an example Mr speaker gentle
lady.
In San Juan County we have a lot
of illegal dumping in our county
and the the county had to step
up and and put
station's pickup stations
all around the county to help
minimize the illegal dumping we
have a lot of federal lands we
have a lot of Indian lands in
San Juan County it was getting
out of hand so with the county
did they stepped up and they
have all these a collection
stations conveniently located
around a big we have a big
County and they use general fund
dollars to help pay for this
extra costs they didn't you know
like they do charge a fee and
inspirational fee but they
didn't want to they didn't want
to the
charging excessive fee where the
citizens would you say the heck
with it we're going to the
nearest Arroyo we're in we're
gonna dump or or trash so that
really has been effective
program and so the the the.
The state environment department
they're kind of the same boat
you know they have a general
budget Mr speaker gentle lady
the twenty five million dollars
whatever was stated earlier and
they do they have to allocate
some of the those budget dollars
to take care some of these
issues and so I think the
concern I have about this your
bill is such a dramatic increase
I know it's been thirteen years
and you know other adjustments
need to be made gentle lady and
Mr speaker but ten times that
that's that's too much and and
I'm getting service you know
concerns from back home these
faster it will be passed on to
the right pair I mean that's
just that's just a fact of life
they're going to pass those
costs on and I I just wish this
is a more reasonable increase
I understand your arguments
gentle lady in.
Mr speaker that you you you want
to build in a fee schedule that
covers a hundred percent these
costs.
That's not a house normally done
you you've got a your budget is
built about all the needs of the
department
in in the environment department
is is very important apartment
and is is the state engineer and
the the EMNRD the energy natural
resources department with you at
all conservation division all
all these departments are are
are super you know super
critical to the well being of
our citizens but I think the the
reason you're getting a lot of
comments of.
from from the this body is
issues to just a.
Just a massive increase so what
gentle lady and do you have any
any comments on on the screen on
the scope of this
that that would give us a little
little inside.
Mr speaker gentleman from San
Juan I do and a just a couple of
thanks I'd like to make and to
some errors in your premise
first of all you're assuming
that the fee structure is going
to meet we go to the five
thousand dollar cap that is in
fact highly highly unlikely
remember the cap is the ultimate
cap and it cannot go beyond them
even with the also living or
inflation kind of amount so the
expectation is the fee is going
to be set somewhere probably in
the middle to allow for some
elbow room as time goes on so
that's point one the you're
estimating it probably some
number of years out which would
make it probably closer to
sixteen seventeen or eighteen
years from the two thousand and
seven number that we've been
talking about
this this cap will not cover a
hundred percent of the cost of
the program even as it is so I
just want to correct those two
items in again I solid waste of
you know I've I've been joking
with my colleague my some of my
friends in the in the house
about this is gonna be the
frontier bill of the session
solid waste is we can joke about
it but extremely important it
has the potential for
environmental impacts across the
state in in small communities so
it really is important that we
fund it adequately that we have
a program where we actually
educating people about the
impacts of dumping for example
which the department does not
have the ability you are they're
very severely hamstrung given
though their budgetary
constraints so I guess those are
my over arching comments Mr
speaker and kind gentleman from
San Juan with regard to your
comments thank you Mr speaker
thank you gentle lady well I
guess some.
To get back to my my my my
experience in raising fees we we
just didn't go this far we we
we took to existing template.
And and we rotation a fixed
amount it was it was reasonable
people people understood it
thought thought it was fair and
this is a little kind of a
moving target and in the cap is
is quite quite high and yeah I
appreciate your your comments of
Mr speaker gentle lady that you
won't go that high but my candy
in my city their little nervous
about this so thank you Mr
speaker thank you generally for
your answers.
There's further debate the
gentleman from Chavis Lee and
Roosevelt Representative
Anderson.
Came with the gentleman from
encouraging about the one with
the Roosevelt and Senegal
Representative Zamora.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady from this lunacy of.
Tallman of the gentle lady from
Los Alamos will gladly yield to
you.
Gentle lady sorry for that
mistake
Los Alamos I I would rise the
also to give Houston testimony
about when.
Fees get raised at the.
At the the site.
We in in curry county have seen
probably the worst one I can
remember was within the past
probably year year and a half
and we had a grain elevator that
had moldy corn.
And instead of hauling it to the
downside.
And taking care of it in a
proper manner they decided to
dump it and scattered on their
land around the grain elevator
because of the cost of the
dumping fees.
That created a problem with the
businesses.
And the homes around or they
dumped the grand because of the
multi grain then then it came a
little rain and then that Google
is getting into the homes and
into the businesses there.
And so we called a meeting.
With the city and I was involved
in that meeting and the owners
of the grain elevator and one of
the issues was how much it was
going to cost them to take this
to the downside.
So these are replications that I
see happening with raising fees.
To the people that go up to the
done.
The gentle lady and and Mr
speaker and and we also see I've
I've always lived out in the
country outside the the city.
And it's not unusual to be
driving down the road and C.
tires.
Whether there.
Truck tires that fit semi
trailers or our car tires.
Because the people feel like
they can't pay the fees or they
can't pay the fees.
And we see those issues around
the dairy for I used to I worked
for twenty two and a half years.
We would have people come from
there in the close neighborhoods
to the dairy and they would dump
their trash.
Bags full of trash or maybe
they'd.
Rake up leaves and they go down
from the bar ditches and we
always have to be picking up
that trash sometimes we would go
through the bags of trash and we
would provide letter heads as to
where it was mailed to and we
would call the sheriff out well
that takes up the time of the
local chair of the come out and
then go to that house make
contact with the people and ask
him to go pick up their trash
and us not to do it again so the
reputations are great not I just
imagine it'll be the same across
the state.
I don't see why it would be any
different
There's a lot of people that
can't afford.
The fees at the done so so they
get rid of the trash elsewhere
and those are those are my
concerns I think a lot of the
issues and and the mechanics and
about the monies and all that
have been touched on a lot of my
questions were answered and
gentle lady I just.
Being a person that lives out in
rural New Mexico we just we just
see a lot of that and and we see
this causing more issues with
that and and that's a great
concern because.
At the overall the the years
that I've that I've seen this
we've seen those dumping fees up
and down and when they're lower
at the at the dump or or they
don't even charge and all some
days because they give you a day
a year or something for spring
cleaning.
A lot of people go to the dump
and the clean clean up around
their yards they they appreciate
that because they don't they
don't have the extra money to be
paying the dumping fees and and
I just see some reputations
following the following from
this and that's why I rise today
is to give you my testimony as
to as to what happens out.
Where we live and in rural New
Mexico and and I thank you for
your time and thank you Mr
speaker.

to that point the record reflect
election necessary for placing
House will to forty eight is
amended on final passage has
been taken gentlelady to explain
the bill.
Thank you Mr speaker the author
office of the superintendent of
insurance is authorized by law
to collect fees from certain
insurers and other persons or
entities transacting insurance
or insurance related business in
the state read fees relating to
things such as applications
license continuations statutory
form filings etcetera in twenty
twenty at the behest of LFC and
DFA OSI reviewed its fee
structure it compared its the
schedule with that of
surrounding states and as a
result of that review it
proposes a fee adjustment
included and house bill to forty
eight as amended.
Where a currency in New Mexico
is similar to a feature in
surrounding areas OSI did not
seek any fee increase
as the bill stands now Mr
speaker there is no fee
increased individual producers
brokers or agents and with that
I stand for questions Mr speaker
there is debate the gentleman
from Chavis Representative
Ezzell.
Mr speaker thank you did I get
my hand up in time you did.
Mr speaker gentle lady will you
yield please Mr speaker gentle
lady I gladly yield to you from
Travis county.
Mr speaker gentle lady said that
this is the fee increase what is
the difference between a fee
increase and a tax increase I
guess I need to know what the
difference there is Mr speaker
gentle lady.
Mr speaker generally from
childhood travels I'll take a
stab at it fees right late
specific activities.
Axes are are of a group of
larger general application I
think that's maybe a fair way to
describe I think the differences
Mr speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker it smells assigned to
maybe gentle lady I see that
this bill that you're carrying
the and insurance fee changes
it's going to increase the
revenue by five million dollars
can you tell me for that five
million dollars is going to come
from please.
Mr speaker gentle lady if you
the amount enrollment fees.
Mr speaker generally I apologize
for the delay
the the
the the additional revenues will
come from the application fees
at setter from those entities
required to
submit applications and the like
along with those fees.
Mr speaker gentle lady could you
give me a quick run down of what
the agent of what to those are I
have not had the time I've been
reading the amendments that were
put on here so I've really not
been able to get to the body of
the bill yet they can you
Representative give me a quick
rundown of what those.
Our.
He contained in the bill on page
two there are examples of see
adjustments for example annual
statement of insurer filing fee
charter documents fees
application for re domestication
fady filing application for
nonprofit health care
preliminary and permanent and
issuance of COVID filing of
managed care plan annual
compliance documentation there
is a rather extensive list the
lady Mr speaker.
Mr speaker seeing that most fees
if there were ten dollars one of
ms jumped up to seventy five
dollars Mr speaker another one
has increased by a hundred
dollars
let's see first and other
substantial one right here.
I don't understand this when Mr
speaker it is says filing
application for regional
producers license and issuance
of a license from thirty dollars
to fifty dollars everything has
jumped up here's another one a
temporary license filing
application is jump from thirty
dollars to a hundred dollars
in every one of these is nothing
more.
I mean these are significant see
increases if you want to call it
fee increases but to me is
nothing more than a tax increase
that is going to be passed on to
the consumers of our state Mr
speaker and the list goes on
because whenever you're talking
about all the speed increases it
goes on for the see now I'm over
the.
US seventh page of the eight
page of that on all these see
increases Mr speaker gentle lady
of.
Ultimately will make up.
Who will be playing these fee
increases.
Mr speaker gentle lady the
insurance companies
to from the fees are charged.
Mr speaker gentle lady we all
know who's going to ultimately
be making up those fee increases
it is the taxpayers of the state
of New Mexico Mr speaker gentle
lady thank you for your
responses.
There's further debate the
gentleman from San Juan
Representative Strickler.
Mr speaker up did you call on
Representative Anderson Sir.
I certainly a you are on the
board I had just called in the
general for San Juan
Representative Strickler.
I will get you Sir.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Thank you Mr speaker the gentle
lady from Los Alamos police
yield.
Mr speaker I gladly yield to the
gentleman from San Juan thank
you gentle lady
We heard we heard this in Tax
committee and
In in the the FIR was very very
helpful
Setting out the adjustments you
know thirty on much different
faced thirty to fifty dollars
sixty to seventy dollars
twenty to thirty dollars you
know and that there were there
were small increments
certainly more the ten times
like the previous bill and in
committee Mr speaker gentle lady
you presented an amendment to to
help the the independent
insurance agents would you go
over there because it I thought
it was a really good amendment.
Mr speaker gentle lady and
ensure with the body how much
that save those folks.
That Mr speaker and gentleman
from San Juan it removed any
proposed earlier proposed fee
increases on individual brokers
and insurance agents and and the
like Mr speaker and gentleman
thank you thank you Mr speaker
thank you gentle lady and that
was real important because the
independent agents
Representative maybe half a
dozen to a dozen companies and
they were going to have a permit
problem and I believe the
originally proposed fee rates
for
Total like three million dollars
is is that is that right gentle
lady.
Mr speaker John from San Juan I
don't recall and I don't have
the FIR in front of me I
apologize I would point out
Mister speaker that as a result
the individuals
entities are now in support of
the bill.
In thank you Mr speaker Mr thank
you gently thank you Mr speaker
that was a that was a really
good change but.
Taking care of those of those
independent agents who represent
again is six to twelve companies
that that really helps them to
keep their.
The face in check but everybody
else.
The larger companies farm bureau
State Farm of farmers.
You know all state all those
those big companies of their
rates are gonna go up about five
million dollars a year is is
that.
Is that right gentle lady Mr
speaker.
I'm Mr speaker and gentleman I
think the more correct way to
put it is the increased fees
will cost to be collected I'm
told around four million dollars
a year by this by the state and
I as I understand it again Mr
speaker and gentleman the fee
increases are are very set the
fees at rates similar to those
of our surrounding states Mr
speaker and gentleman from San
Juan.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady and appreciate that
and but but ultimately the four
million dollars in fee increases
will will be passed on to to the
premium holders or the
the insurer and we all of we all
need to be remembered you know
can't remember that says thank
you gentle lady for explaining
the the the amendment to that
help the independent to
insurance agents and that close
my comments thank you.
Next to the general curry
Representative Crowder thank you
Mr Senator gentlelady from Los
Alamos please you.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
curry county I yield.
Thank you generally generally
out of plants through the bill
of looked over to look through
it but I haven't to
Representative read it from
cover to cover that and curious
did any of the fees go down.
I I didn't I didn't see any us
us on the state the same but did
any of the fees decrease.
Mr speaker John give me one
moment.
Mr speaker and gentleman there
were a few in a few a few cases
and it would we're in cases
where the superintendent of
insurance determine that are
fees were a little bit high
higher than those in surrounding
state.
Thank you generally I'll run
back to their seats on final I
didn't see M. and a and a quick
look at that so I thought well
I'll just ask
a second question is
I noticed this affects the of
the medical industry lots of
industries page industries will
be will feel greatest impact of
these the increases where is the
heaviest burden live or did they
have a chance to analyze the
impact to like the medical
industry the insurance industry
that the attorneys such as that
can you ensure that Johnny
Mister speaker.
Mr speaker gentleman let me
confer with my expert who by the
way I said identify apologize
I've not done that I'm
conferring with the
superintendent of insurance
Russell old so I'm I apologies
for not making that clear
earlier.
Mr speaker gentleman from curry.
This bill applies only to
insurance companies and
insurance related businesses
that I'm sorry if I wasn't clear
earlier Mr speaker about that
but that's what that's what this
bill relates to and so I am I
hope that helps implement with
your question Mr speaker John.
thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
that does help I I did see
reference to some medical.
Facilities in here but I guess
it's the insurance of the
medical facility and so I I just
assume that it's applied to
construction or or
I see the term insurance
everywhere now but I thought it
applied to several different
agencies as far as fees for
picking up documents and things
like that which I don't really
think if you need a copy of a
birth certificate or different
things of that nature those fees
in here is it just insurance.
Mr speaker installment from
curry it's really to the
insurance industry in insurance
related certainly not birth
certificates or any of those
kinds of filing fees.
Thank you Joe I appreciate that
and I noticed on page two of
your bill gentlelady items do
through.
H. number two it looks like our
all new fees that are being
created.
And and this for a nonprofit
health care plan preliminary
permits and and different things
like that and I think when I saw
the term health care in here's
where I begin to think well as
must have to do with hospitals
and health care and things but
I'm wondering of the C. increase
the four million dollar fee
increase how much of it is an
increase on existing fees and
how much of it are new fees that
were not charged prior to your
bill do you have that answer
deleted Mr speaker.
Mr speaker and gentleman the fee
increases apply only to existing
fees although I've been advised
that some of them were renamed
because there were other changes
in the insurance code in other
places so we we the the names of
the fees were changed
accordingly Mr speaker John.
Okay and generally like on page
three where I see it adjourns on
vending machine license and
things of that nature it's a
that's part of what caused me to
think this is broader not just
insurance agencies that this
doesn't affect any of the fees
are or licenses for contractors
construction those type things
it our illustrious insurance
related they're they're not
included in your bill is that
correct Mr speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker John that's correct
okay thank you very much I
appreciate your patience and and
let me ask my questions I thank
you very much already thank you
Mr speaker thank you.
This further debate the
gentleman from Chavis Lee and
Roosevelt.
Mr speaker my question was
answered in previous debate
thank you.
Thank you John Dona Ana grant is
here Representative access.
Thank you Mr speaker.
With the kindly please yield.
Mr speaker and gentleman I'm
happy to yield.
Thank you kindly so.
My question is.
I keep hearing that we're
Trying to lower premiums.
I hear that as a as a discussion
throughout the body and how
premiums insurance premiums are
high and how we want more more
people to be able to afford
premiums yet this bill would
probably do.
The exact opposite.
So my question is why was it
necessary to raise the fees
besides to it just being
The right thing to do I guess
because the neighboring states
are charging that.
Mr speaker gentleman I think my
explanation as the explanation I
gave and that was at the behest
of the LFC and the DFA the
insurance department in this
review and felt it kept it he
speaks fee structure kept it in
line with those fees structures
of the surrounding states Mr
speaker and gentleman.
I'm sorry I'm I'm having trouble
understanding are you saying
that you we excuse me Mr speaker
gentle lady I'm sorry I'm
understood misunderstanding that
are maybe I'm not getting it so
it's just because other states
are doing this that we feel that
we need to do this and I'm sorry
I I up I had my ear piece and I
couldn't hear you.
Mr speaker I I wouldn't say it's
just because what the Office of
in superintendent insurance did
was a value wait their program
and the term and whether or not
your fee structure was
reasonable and based on the
review that they did they
determined that in some areas
the fees were not appropriate
and we're hello as compared with
surrounding states and as a
result they are seeking to see
an increase in conformance with
advice given to them by the LFC
and DFA Mr speaker John thank
you Mr speaker gentle lady so is
it are are the is this causing
them to fall under budget is
this why we're having to do
this.
Mr speaker gentleman monies that
are raised will go into the
general fund.
Mr speaker gentle lady so this
is to raise money for the
general fund.
Mr speaker and gentleman it will
it will provide money to the
general fund as well as the fire
protection fund.
Mr speaker gentle lady course of
money to the fire protection
fund goal what is it necessary
for.
Mr speaker gentle and give me
one.
Mr speaker and gentleman the
fire protection funds are used
for saying such as training of
fire departments especially
those that are smaller such as
volunteer fire departments and
it helps in that training
results in lower insurance rates
for the communities are served
by those departments Mr speaker
and gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady one of
those people that read
definitely supports the those
Types of fire departments cause
us we live in rural New Mexico
so it sounds good but how much
of that fund the money that's
being raised or does it go up in
in other words if you could
break down in general their
budget doesn't mean I can't
reverted back to the general
fund.
Yes
Mr speaker gentle on the break
down is roughly.
Two and a half million of the
monies raised through this
through these fees will go into
the general fund and a roughly
one point five million we'll go
into the fire protection fund Mr
speaker and gentleman.
Mr speaker gentle lady so.
Questions gonna go to the fire
fire fund.
And then as the is that a
hundred percent use toward.
the pro the I don't know
training and all those things
that you listed earlier for just
fire protection stuff or does
any of that go back somehow to
the state budget to the general
fund.
Mr speaker gentleman my
understanding is the fire
protection fund is used for the
purposes of the fire protection
fund and not revert back.
Mr speaker gentle lady so I
guess what what I'm what causes
me stress and worry is
What I've been hearing the last
few days about insurance and how
it's necessary for us to try to
do the best we can as a body to
keep premiums low so that we can
get more people I think that was
argued quite heavily the other
day on on the importance of
keeping our premiums low
So my question to you is what
effect will this have on our
premiums across the board.
Mr speaker in conferring with
the superintendent of insurance
he reminded me that relative to
these million dollar billion
dollar companies these are very
small increases and we should
not expect a one for one
increase if any as a result of
these fees Mr speaker gentleman.
Speaker gentle lady I would
argue that I don't believe that
any insurance company or a
company like that absorbs it out
of the kindness of their heart I
feel that they'll pass it on and
with a bit more
increase on top of that they're
just not in the business of
absorbing costs like this it's
we're talking about several
million dollars and I just don't
see them doing that.
Mr speaker gentle lady
you know again I'm I'm so
concerned about the premium
increase
surely there's got to be some
sort of
information stating how this
will affect us and so Mister
speaker gentle lady I guess what
I'm is this so these are just
fees I just wanna make sure I
understand this are these just
fees through the insurance
companies for any type of
insurance or certain types of
insurance.
Mr speaker gentle and listed in
the bill are of variety of
filing applications and
documentations it cetera at may
or may not be required of the
insurance company and it's quite
a long list and so that's what
you see increases apply to.
Speaker gentle lady I guess I'm
trying to generalize it maybe
make it a little simpler would
it be for health life auto I
mean in general what would be
affected.
Yeah Mr speaker and gentleman
thank you for your patience it
applies to it as I said and I
I'm sorry if I'm repeating
myself it applies to insurance
companies and those could be
medical insurance companies
those could be auto insurance
companies etcetera who we just
the legislature have impose
these different types of filing
requirements requirements and
that's what it applies to and I
can just supplement another
answer because the
superintendent reminded me what
most early affects premiums is
history the claims history
associated with claims not fees
such as this one billion dollar
companies Mr speaker John.
Mr speaker gentle lady I would
agree with that that those are
those are obviously some of the
things that
I guess that affect the premium
increases but any anything that
is a a a.
Liability to the insurance will
be passed on whether it's
whether it's past history of
whether your kid is eighteen
years old and trying to drive a
red car which is not good by the
way for.
If you have kids also Mr speaker
gentle lady I guess I guess I'm
just I I again I I'm I don't
repeat myself over and over but
it does cause me great concern I
know that it will.
From if what I'm hearing from
you then it'll be spread across
the board from our home
insurance or auto insurance or
health insurance life insurance
all those different sectors will
be affected would that be fair
to say.
Mr speaker actually no I don't
believe that to be the case
after consulting with the office
of the superintendent of
insurance who I think is very
knowledgeable in this field you
he tells me it's very unlikely
that these fees increases will
have any significant if any
impact on premiums.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
I I I'm sorry I'm going to
respectfully disagree and I'm
sure he's he knows a lot more
about insurance and I do but I
will say that I know that any
small
Adverse affect or cost to the
insurance company or any entity
will pass it on to the customers
thank you very much for for
answering my questions I listen
to the gentle lady.
Thank you very much John.

commission to set salaries
various public officials
this is kind of the continuing
development.
Of making the state more
professional with that
madam speaker I do have a four
amendment.
when it's appropriate that I
believe has been passed out when
it's appropriate Madam speaker
I'll be happy to talk about.
Gentleman what is that number is
two two zero six two seven point
one.
Gentleman to explain the
amendment Madam speaker what
this amendment was designed to
do this is following the
committee discussions and it
does several things it changes
the compact commission make up
it also adds geographic
diversity it makes some
technical changes including we
had salaries for the public
regulation commission we took
that out since they're now
pointed and we added magistrates
and that generates one thing
ma'am thank you madam chair.
Madam speaker.
Is there debate on the
amendment.
The gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln.
Thank you madam speaker with a
gentleman from Santa Fe County
you'll I will yield to the
gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln County.
I thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen just want to go
over the amendment quickly so
people understand.
The commission would now be
composed of two government
portal appointments one spring
court appointment and for
legislative appointments is that
correct madam speaker
gentleman's Jana legislative
appointments we wanted to have
one from the speaker one to
minority leader in the house and
on the Senate side the president
pro tem and the minority leader
in the Senate because we want
this body no similar what we
deal with the ethics commission
to be a bipartisan approach to
the commission.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you John look for that answer
and then the with respect to
such a very I've seen were
dealing with the magistrate
courts I haven't seen this
language before could you maybe
explain why the magistrate court
section is is being added to
this
bill or house resolution you
madam speaker gentleman this was
at the specific request if the
general call for judiciary of
the Chief Justice and of the
judiciary question where the
magistrate judge's.
Madam speaker and gentle
gentleman I appreciate your
considering some of the comments
that we made and Judiciary
Committee of making these
amendments I think a.
well I may not be able to
support the legislation I do
support the amendment I believe
that this constitutes a much
better
Cross section of our our state
than than the original form so I
appreciate your bringing those
with respect to the magistrate
courts
sensei asked to be part of it we
get the judiciary all in the
same bill and I'll send all the
judicial salaries in the state
except for probate judges and
municipal court judges of you
know I understand work work work
our court system correctly madam
speaker and gentleman is that
correct Madam speaker John that
is my.
MasterCard's online thank you.
Is there further debate on the
amendment.
Is there objection to adopt to
adopting the amendment.
Representative Anderson did you
want to speak on the amendment
or on the bill.
Madam speaker I'm to speak on
the bill thank you.
Seeing no objection you have an
amended bill.
Gentleman you have an amended
bill thank you madam speaker I
will stand for questions.
There is debate on the bill the
gentleman from San Juan
Representative lane.
Thank you madam speaker the
gentleman from Bernalillo
Sandoval kindly you madam
speaker I yield to the gentleman
from San Juan.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you John
Madam speaker John from
Bernalillo Sandoval and I'm
looking at on page one section
one.
Representative A. as in aspects
and our understand this public
officer seller commission that
is being created by this bill is
it creates a new state agency is
that correct Madam speaker
gentleman that is correct and
madam speaker gentleman from
Bernalillo Sandoval the the
direction of the state and
agencies specifically under the
seven commissioners who are to
be appointed as provided in this
bill is that correct.
Madam speaker gentleman
partially correct when you pass
a constitutional amendment bill
will then come back to the
legislature to do enabling
legislation so I haven't fleshed
out but yes generally speaking
that is correct you are seven
commissions.
Mr speaker and gentleman for
Madam speaker gentleman from
burning Senator thanks for the
clarification and so I haven't
been part of this body when we
have to come back to the
nibbling legislation I'm
assuming that nothing in the
enabling legislation could
contradict what's in the tax
that we see here today is that
correct Madam speaker gentleman
that is correct.
Madam speaker John from
Bernalillo assemble thanks for
the clarification.
and so I I noticed also.
If we if we go down to page
three of the bill.
Or I guess I should refer to as
built the house joint
resolution.
Subparagraphs C..
I noticed that the word shall
was new and so.
Madam speaker gentle in the way
I would interpret this languages
is to mean that the commission
if the voters of New Mexico
approved this joint resolution.
The commission will become the
only entity beside the salaries
of the officers who were listed
in lines four through thirteen
is that correct.
I'm Madam speaker John that's
correct I I do want to however
point out that aligns ten and
eleven works as public
regulation commissioner over
that's been taken out by the
amendment so and what would be
added as magistrates March of
last line Legislature enabling
legislation to add additional
public bridge that is correct
Madam speaker and gentleman
thanks for the clarification so
the the the seller commission on
there they will be the only.
Like the agency that is
responsible for seven dollars
for the governor our judges
legislators.
and then whatever other public
officers legislators may find is
that correct Madam speaker
gentleman that's correct.
And madam speaker gentleman from
Bernalillo Sandoval.
would you informing who
currently under our current New
Mexico law.
Who currently sits dollar for
the governor.
Madam speaker gentle readers
this body along with governor
you and madam speaker gentleman
what about for the secretary of
state R. Madam speaker Johnson
answered.
And madam speaker gentleman I
assume the same as for state
auditor Attorney General state
treasurer is that correct Madam
speaker John and that is
correct.
So then I think sort of what I
see as the main thrust of this
legislation it transfers the
forty.
To set those salaries from us
says the elected body the
legislature to this seven member
commission is that correct Madam
speaker John that is close.
And madam speaker gentleman
those seven members of the
commission they are not elected
by the citizens of New Mexico is
that correct Madam speaker John
that is also correct.
And madam speaker gentleman from
Bernalillo incentive also in
order to say let's take the
governor's solar for example.
The way I read this joint
resolutions in order for that
salary be chains we would need a
vote of four of those
commissioners are correct Madam
speaker and gentleman that is
going to depend on the enabling
legislation so we haven't done
right have major voter two
thirds none of that has been
decided it you said it correctly
at the beginning we can't switch
yes what is in the constitution
of the constitution is amended
but we can certainly flush Act
and that's what the enabling
legislation us.
Madam speaker general thanks for
the clarification so some this
body for example could save some
major we could we could require
a two thirds vote.
I'm assuming I guess I don't
know maybe maybe notices on some
of gonna go below major that
would make sense so we're
talking about probably either
several major or something like
two thirds of recorders that
correct Mr chair unanimous
depends on the legislature
decides.
And madam speaker gentle and I I
just want to ask a little bit
too about the concept of.
Specifically talk about the dish
your.
the responsibility and oversight
for setting the salaries of the
judiciary.
How does this bill aligned with
what our current system provides
for which is the just
additional compensation
commission.
How does this joint resolution.
align with that that for
commission.
Madam speaker John and if I
understand the question I'm sure
I can answer this one.
When she dresses the help you're
trying Judiciary he said that
once we made the changes that he
had recommended by adding the
magistrates.
Yes house joint resolution has
the missionaries one hundred
percent support so I am assuming
but I don't know this that this
would take over that function
and of the judiciary is
satisfied that would do this
they are happy with Mr.
Madam speaker German so.
The way I understand additional
compensation commission of
essentially it's a it's also
appointed commission and they
evaluate the salaries of of all
levels of of our judicial
members of that that sit on the
bench and then they make a
recommendation to the LESC of
the DFA about potential salary
increase is that correct
John R. I believe that's correct
I don't want to represent myself
as you explore on that area hi
Max but I think generally
speaking that is correct.
Madam speaker and gentleman
thank you and so I I do I do I
think this would probably make
the the general compensation
commencing.
Of life we pointless because the
wait at least need you've got to
go back in and then the steps
and I do think there might be
some value in having that
mission.
The judicial compensation
commission and make a
recommendation to this new
commission that's being created
but that specific subset of
statute that actually have to be
amended because right now.
The way the statue reads and and
the way I understand it is the
judicial compensation commission
reports to the DFA and the LESC
and so I think we would if we
wanted to keep that judicial
compensation commission alive we
would need to now directs them
to this new status see that
we're creating but as you say
you're not expert in that so
that that maybe when we do
enabling legislation maybe
that's something that the body
to consider at that time.
I I want to also ask about
I guess the concern that I have
and see what the best best
impacts the state constitutional
rights of the citizens of New
Mexico and here's what I'm
getting at.
Madam speaker gentleman are you
familiar with the negative
referendum Division found an
article four section one of the
New Mexico constitution.
Senator John I am not.
so madam speaker gentleman.
What article four section one of
the next constitution provides
essentially if the citizens of
New Mexico are not happy with
that particular piece of
legislation.
That is passed by both houses
and signed into law by the
governor there is a petition
process by which the citizens
can collect petitions and
there's there's a number that
has to be requirements our our
students requirements.
And if those requirements are
met and then it goes on the next
general ballot and the citizens
can vote whether to affected we
repealed that piece of
legislation.
now speaker Germans does that
process makes sense.
Madam speaker German it does I'm
not sure it has to invest we're
talking about amending the
constitution so once this is
amended its rent that's what
we're doing.
We're not talking about passing
bills we're talking about
passing house joint resolution
that will then go to the voters
so I don't know I have to go
back and look at the section of
why you're referring to but it
sounds like that is responding
to a bill that is passed by the
legislature rather than
something that's put on the
ballot for the voters to adopt
as a constitutional amendment
but honestly Madam speaker
general now.
Madam speaker and and gentleman
you raise a good point
it does not apply to
construction equipment and
applies only bills and so I
think that highlights why this
is a problem for the citizens
New Mexico so let me give an
example.
If we as the body passed a bill
that.
Directs the governor's salary
let's say for for using apples
to become two hundred fifty
thousand dollars.
That's a bill that's a statute
governor signs into law citizens
have the right under our state
constitution article four
section one to go to that
negative referendum process what
we're doing is we're amending
the constitution the check out
the ability of the Legislature
to set those salaries yes
statute and therefore I would
submit that and citizens lose
that right next negative
referring does that make sense
Spanish speaker general.
Madam speaker John it makes
sense except remember we are
going to have a subsequent
discussion on enabling
legislation so that you're if
you're correct in your
assumption the voters would
still have some saying that but
honestly this is getting into
such a hypothetical discussion
Madam speaker John I couldn't
answer the question we are
amending the constitution if
this house joint resolution
passes to allow the voters to
decide whether there should be a
commission separate and
independent from the legislature
executive and judicial branches
process hours to eliminate those
conflicts to make this more
professional kind of setting
where salaries that just make
sense to me what the legislature
would come in and discuss the
particulars of it and probably
addressed some of the issues
that you're referring to in
terms of what the review process
would be all of those things
should be decided by the
workers.
Madam speaker and gentleman
thank you for that
so I I do think it actually is
is an important conversation on
this in my opinion does affect
state constitutional rights of
our citizens are not granted the
negative referendum process is
not.
It's not follow very often buyer
citizens in Mexico
but the point is is it's a
current rights that we have as
New Mexico citizens and what I
fear one of the results of this
legislation will be is that New
Mexicans lose that rights as
guaranteed by the state
constitution what we're talking
about increasing salaries of
these elected officials.
And I think maybe that this
highlights I guess the
philosophical differences Madam
speaker that I have with this
bill I have real concerns about
this trend that I see with with
our legislative body which is to
abdicate authority as a
legislator.
Of one of our constitutional
powers is to control the purse
string that's why we pass the
budget for example for the
entire state and all of its
agencies in my opinion this is
not a red or blue issue this is
not a Democrat Republican issue
this estimate fundamentally is a
separation of powers issue and I
believe that we as legislation
should jealously guard our
constitutional powers including
setting by staff and the salary
for each of these elected
officials in and there is a
significant amount of power that
this legislation if it's passed
and if the people of New Mexico
I agree with.
That is going to transfer the
power to control the salaries
from seventy members the
legislature so in the house
forty two in the Senate and the
governor signed now we're gonna
transfer all about aborting all
of those checks and balances to
a commission of seven and I have
real concerns about that in the
environment I think this is a
separation of powers issue and
for those reasons I cannot
support this legislation thank
you.
There is further debate the
gentleman from Chavis Lee and
result nineties Representative
Anderson.
Thank you madam speaker well the
gentleman from Santa you.
I will yield to the leader.
Thank you thank you gentlemen
chairman
I'm gonna.
I hope I don't ask you to be
redundant but and I want to hold
this **** up at sort of the
highest level I can because I'm
I'm interested in of
the the
Public officers salaries that
would be included did I hear the
the the term provided.
Question Madam speaker John when
you did.
And just in the in in the course
of of additional explanation
could you elaborate on that only
because Mr speaker and gentleman
I'm under the opinion that the
New Mexico constitution
prohibits the legislature from
receiving salary question.
Madam speaker John that is
correct we are limited to per
diem.
Thank you in and what it the end
of Mr speaker and gentleman be
accurate to say that included in
this of
the people this amendment to our
constitution of there would be a
change in legislative.
Per diem versus to to a salary
question.
Madam speaker gentleman if this
how strong resolution were to
pass out of both chambers get to
the voters and be approved by
the voters legislators could be
pay that is correct.
And Mr speaker and gentleman
that would be in the form of
enabling legislation passing
subsequent to this amendment
passing question.
Madam speaker it would actually
be one further step so we would
go to the voters they were
approved a constitutional
amendment legislature would then
meet pass NA one legislation and
then a commission would be
appointed and then the
commission would make it
whatever appropriate decision
was consistent with both the
constitutional enabling
legislation.
Thank you for that then Mr
speaker and gentleman my I'm
getting to the end of my
questions here
If.
But I suppose I I am working
through the idea of the
Legislature giving up some of
its power of the purse strings
currently as you previously said
the salaries are a legislative
responsibility and we are
sliding not sliding we are
creating a new commission of I
don't like to professionals to
make the salary decisions
My concern is this gentleman Mr
speaker.
If the salaries are set by the
commission must the legislature
include those salaries that are
set by this commission in house
bill two in future general
appropriations act yes question.
Our ministry the gentleman yes
whatever the probation and house
bill two or something similar to
that that would be discussing
the budget you got thank you
gentlemen Mr speaker and and
that only goes to my last
question which is I am try
trouble by the concept that
that.
Your legislative shares may be
bound to pass compensation
levels that.
The state can't afford them the
money is not there of that in
theory gentleman Mr speaker if
the state.
If the salaries were too high
and revenues were too low.
The the future legislature would
have no choice but to make cuts
elsewhere in order to meet these
mandatory salary future salary
requirements is there more or
less correct gentleman question
madam speaker gentleman it's not
correct and the reason it's not
correct just because the
enabling legislation just
because the legislature appoints
a commission substance hours
doesn't mean that they can't do
something to protect the purse
strings in our when that
discussion happens it'll be on
the floor of this house and the
house concert programmers for
those showers so it all depends
on what the enabling legislation
is and no I look forward to that
discussion Sunday I would likely
will not be here for that but
hopefully you will be and that
discretion be interested but I
do think the legislature will
have an active role in setting
some parameters as to what the
commission credit.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen your answer relieve me
of my.
Of.
You'll to find concern on
perhaps binding future
legislatures and
That of course of is is
premature only because an
enabling act by this body would
be the basis upon which
compensation future salaries for
public officials would be
considered and under what
circumstance so chairman I
appreciate very much you
question your responses and Mr
speaker that concludes my
questions thank you.
There's further debate the
gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln County Representative
Nibert.
Thank you madam speaker of a
gentleman from Santa Fe County
again you know madam speaker I
will yield to the gentleman from
Chavis and Lincoln.
thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen.
I'd like to
Ask questions on two different
subjects for the first will be
the judicial and maybe other
salaries and then I'd like to
talk a little bit about the
legislative salaries afterwards.
Madam speaker and gentleman
I think we've known for quite
some time that the judiciary.
In New Mexico by and large is is
largely under under funded in
the chart in the sense that
we're not paying judges
salaries that are commensurate
with not only the surrounding
states but also frankly
commensurate to encourage.
Well.
Educated and trained attorneys
of the state to maybe consider
accepting a position on the
budget.
And so I rise Madam speaker and
gentleman to to support that
aspect of this legislation
because I think it's sorely
needed because notwithstanding
the judicial compensation
commission efforts.
We have not either as a body was
a legislature as a whole or
frankly a state government
provided.
Sufficient funds.
In the judiciary budget to
accomplish what I think ought to
be
the goal of getting a very well
respected judiciary employees
and so I am pleased to see the
the portion of this resolution
that that deals with that issue
and I hope that the people that
are.
Selected to serve on this
commission should be.
a constitutional provision that
these people will will not only
look into that issue but will
follow through with what those
recommendations and I say that
a lot of your discussion Madam
speaker and gentleman
with respect to the issue raised
by the gentleman from Travis
county earlier about whether or
not it handcuffs the legislative
branch yeah appropriating monies
that I agree with you that that
so it should be done in the
legislation that would follow
the constitutional amendment.
What might Madam speaker and
gentleman of.
My second
Madam.
I I do believe that.
The legislative branch if this
prostration anymore passes.
This will pave the way for a
professional legislature are
paid legislature Madam speaker
and gentleman would you agree
with that statement.
Madam speaker and gentleman I
hope so.
And madam speaker and gentleman
of.
We've had the debates on on that
issue the last a few years and
I'm still not over that hurdle
I'd still white having the
citizen legislature but I also
see sense I believe or maybe one
of two states that do not the
Hey their legislators
that the hand writings on the
wall and that the we're going to
have to deal with this issue at
some point I look like it's upon
us madam speaker gentleman's
What would be your opinion and I
say opinion because I don't
think there's a real answer to
that at this point but what
would be your opinion as to.
If this becomes a constitutional
provision and we get to get
employment over your opinion as
to how long it would take to
actually put into place Hey.
Mechanism for a rate legislature
and and also
Madam speaker and gentleman.
Our current facilities capable
of handling that type of
legislative.
I'm.
Madam speaker and gentleman and
I hope I understand the question
so in terms of the time when I
think I can answer so this would
go on the ballot most likely in
November of twenty twenty two.
Then the enabling assuming was
passed enabling legislation
worker in twenty twenty three.
And it would go into effect and
then be I've been listening all
emergency legislation and
instrument legislature passed
some provision for legislative
salaries in the summer of twenty
twenty three that's a kind of
the timeline works that way.
In terms of and I'm not that's
what directing I'm unclear on a
gentle lady I'm sorry Madam
speaker gentleman
is your second question and if I
could ask Madam speaker and
gentleman if you could rephrase
that I'm happy to answer I'm
just not sure I understood.
Madam speaker and gentleman of.
Right now we've seen some of.
Impediments with respect to our
current physical facilities
dealing with the COVID issues
are we on this side of the
legislature we are all doubled
up except for maybe a couple of
us and that's cause some
problems in the current
situation but I think if we go
to a professional legislature.
One that requires maybe more
time.
And possibly more effort that it
will be very difficult to to
have.
That and still have the current
office arrangements and right
now we have no staff once we
once we leave here in a week and
a half.
We have no rate assistant we
have no staff
maybe maybe the speaker has some
staff of maybe the minority
office as some staff but other
than that we are are.
I mean people ask me well all
get something do you provided
the system I said well you're
talking to I mean.
Yes it's just us and so my my
question is
would you anticipate that that
this legislation if we move in
that direction that we're going
to have to address two things
number one the physical plant
maybe expanding the number of
offices available to to the
representatives and secondly
whether in conjunction with that
we're going to need to expand
the number of staff members who
would be the other part time or
full time basis.
Yeah
Madam speaker and gentleman I I
want to be sure of what I answer
this question because this is
really just my personal opinion
in terms of how are what
invasion as I think first things
first if you were able to Hey
legislators I do think you cast
a wider net in terms of the
people that would be able
financially to be able to serve
in this body you would have a
wider group of people and
therefore a more diverse group
of people to choose from and
probably and hopefully you know
that would improve kind of the
dialogue in the building not
casting aspersions on anyone
here would just improve it so
that's kind of the first step in
terms of whether that would mean
additional staff and space and
those kind of things we're
talking about obviously that
would be up to a legislature and
say twenty twenty three or
twenty twenty four as those
things developed but from my
personal opinion yes that would
be a positive development this
state pricing is getting very
quickly more and more I think
Banced sophisticated we are
moving in a professional
direction that's why the ethics
commission was so important as
we move into a more complex
state we are going to need
assistance I I love the idea and
I really do of the volunteer
legislature that just sounds
great in concept but it is
literally a hundred years old.
It is time for the state frankly
to grow up and to have that
trying to professionalism so do
I anticipate and hope from my
personal point of view not
speaking for any other members
of the body that this would
eventually lead to staff and in
a more are organized effort in
terms of our professional
legislature yes because I do
think what that will lead to is
legislators being able to rely
less for example on lobbyist
shoot to be able to delve into
and research issues so that when
we come to the legislature it's
not this kind of wash of
legislation is coming out as the
we're having to try to read on
the fly and we all know how
difficult that process has been
to try to be thoughtful and
collected in terms of we're
doing legislation Madam speaker
gentleman I mean I see you in
both of our committees together
you and I you know for over that
legislation but it is incredibly
difficult to do that on the fly
and if we had a more
professional legislature I think
we would have better legislation
commenced on better drafted
better thought about our
policies that we could really
start to think about and on a
more independent based that we
should really be thinking about
it with respect to where our
constituencies are to be able to
better respond that's the other
thing is to be able to better
respond or constituency and was
all of us have experienced the
ticket was during this pandemic
we have lots of calls to trying
to dress them yes just
personally impossible to do that
during the course of the session
without the assistance of the
staff that's able and instead
has institutional knowledge to
be able to address those
concerns so do I anticipate that
we are moving in that direction
yes the purpose of this is
simply to give the voters a
choice.
Do they want to have an
independent body to start to set
salaries of public that's really
the question and if they do the
legislature gets to regress all
of the interesting issues that
you are talking about right.
Thank you madam speaker and in
just a moment yeah I I I just
your opinion on that because
you've already announced even
though not the.
You have no skin in the game for
when this would occur and so
your opinion on this is not
jaded by your personal of views
all whether you yourself want to
be a professional legislator not
you've amounts are not running
this will not affect you in the
slightest and so hi I think your
opinion on this issue is is
important because not only the
the sponsor of this legislation
which also our approach into
from what I considered at and un
biased position because it's not
going to to affected may not
affect me either but but do you
have have announced that yeah
the most of the rest of us the
this legislation could.
Affect us Madam speaker and
gentleman just just for my own
two cents I would I would state
that.
This situation that we're in
right now as pointed out to me a
real need for some additional.
Infrastructure for the capitol
complex and that frankly our
offices are are inadequate
having the I doubled up on like
our colleagues on the other side
of that wall of the Senate and
so I argued to Mr Burciaga that
we ought to have some plans to
maybe.
Bill the building or have space
available so that.
That people the house of
representatives have an office
and they're not having to worry
about the person that they start
office with whether it's COVID
or whether it's a traditional
flu that we all get when we're
here in most years of the
members of the chamber so I
think
Whether this thing passes or not
I would just look at what you
that that that I would certainly
support at that issue
Madam speaker and gentleman the
magistrates salaries that you
added into this
Right now there are set barred
by statute this commission would
within seven thousand and would
it be just lumped in with the
rest of the judicial budget date
was that what you would
anticipate or would that be a
separate line item because of
but look like they were separate
apple on the amendment Madam
speaker gentleman's I honestly
don't know this came for dental
professionals from Judiciary I
assume that would be worked out
I know that the magistrate judge
of court of it as a
representative Allison the rest
in Judiciary so I assumed they
work that out and I don't dare
speak for the judiciary as as
the gentleman might remember I
costs the Chief Justice and we
get to do that once so I I won't
be guessing what the judiciary
wants to do with respect to
budgetary line items as we move
down the road.
And madam speaker and gentleman.
My last question
Would be with respect to
The location of the public
regulation commission because
there may be some members of the
spotted a one year when we took
that out but Madam speaker and
gentleman if I recall we have
now by constitutional amendment
eliminated the.
Alexion of public regulation
commissioners and so they will
be an appointed position under
our by the governor that's your
I should ask questions Senator
gentleman is that why they were
omitted
in your amendment Madam speaker
and gentleman yes and I think
what happened was this was
drafted from a piece of
legislation two thousand
nineteen and was just a grafting
error that that state in there
without the thought process that
they don't belong anymore and so
they were taken act you're
correct
thank you madam speaker
gentleman's again are are really
likes the provisions regarding
many of the salaries yeah I'm
particularly liked your answer
to the gentleman from Chavis
earlier that dealt with the
enabling legislation.
Requiring still input from this
body and and setting overall
grandmothers and of our of the
money available for the salaries
but
I'm I'm still
a little concerned about moving.
More quickly toward a
professional legislature work
we've been stagnant in our
population now for for a decade
and if we had robust growth I
would I would be more easily
fall in line with your position
on that stagnant growth I I'm a
little concerned so madam
speaker and gentleman thank you
for the debate thank you for the
time.
The gentle lady from Bernalillo
Santa and Santa Fe counties
Representative Lori.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentleman from Bernalillo and
Sandoval please yield will yield
Madam speaker to the gentle lady
from Bernalillo Sandoval and
etcetera thank you so much thank
you madam chair so everyone else
stole my thunder ready at my
questions so I do have a few
more to ask you on this so what
I wanted to make sure I just
wanted to clarify in this
there's a total of seven people
on this committee the maximum
could be for Democrats and that
would leave three Republicans
possibly in this committee is
that correct.
you madam speaker hold on a
second let me just and gentle
lady I think that's correctly
that we upgraded the math in my
head.
Yeah I believe that's correct
Stricker General.
Thank you madam chair and damage
yeah it was one of my concerns
because.
You'll never know what it's like
to be in the minority it's not
always fun because you get your
out numbered all the time and
that's what the first things I
looked down at the army and here
we go again there's gonna be a
committee where we are
outnumbered once again and that
this troublesome I would like it
better if it was at least equal
numbers because it is very hard
when you're so passionate you're
trying to speak for a majority
of the people and you don't get
your voice heard I I want to
make sure that with this
commissioners what these
commissioners and it would be
fair and level playing ground
so.
madam chair Mister speaker with
us so what this committee that
we're going to have what what
their salaries be for each year
so madam speaker gentle lady she
we don't know yet right because
what what's going to happen is
is will shut up the if the
voters approve this
let's get let's say in the
general election twenty twenty
two the legislature point to
commissioners and the
commissioners will decide but as
we talked about no and I and I
realize this is this is kind of
a cumbersome process why
absolutely don't mind going
through it several times but the
ideas as the Legislature project
I think under this legislation
some parameters the commission
will then meet and they would
then separate showers so we
don't know yet what those would
be.
Thank you madam chair Mister
speaker yeah that's what I it
and so it was a learning process
for me because I was looking
through some of this analysis
that we got and I realized I
didn't know this New Hampshire
gets one hundred dollars a year
and a per diem.
AS very interesting fact I did
not know that so we in New
Mexico we technically get no
money but yet we do get a per
diem and we also get a tension
we do get attention will all
that be considered I guess what
I'm trying to figure out what.
What what the formula be for
them or do you have any idea
what how will it be because the
Rangers are all over the place I
took out all the people that go
full time that's not applicable
I deftly to California actors
are completely not applicable to
us at all.
But I looked at other states
like Nebraska they get twelve
thousand dollars a year Rhode
Island gets fifteen thousand and
again those are folks that know
per diem.
Chair which is actually really
rich Davis president twenty
eight thousand or per diem
Louisiana get sixteen thousand
with no per diem so do we have
any ideas based on our budget or
is going to be that they come up
with something that we're trying
to force the budget to fit that
house second plant manager
generally I'm that speaker I'm
sorry generated no idea this
this simply allows the
Legislature to consider that
issue and then send those
parameters to the commission but
we don't have the whole point is
to open up those options that
are currently for closed.
Thank you madam chair and
mystery I am sent me to the
right madam speaker excuse me
should have that freedom hive
before spoke
S. H. so I guess it's just.
I get a little tripped up on
that because you know we are the
legislature's you speak for the
people and I like to keep it
that way I wish it was a
different way to do this process
I don't like to surrender my
power needed to mention stirs my
constituents are very hardcore
in their beliefs and they like
to keep we the people and
everything so I'm trying to say
because we're trying to cast a
bigger net I get that but I'm
wondering how much of a bigger
net we can cast if it's going to
end up being ten to fifteen
thousand dollars and no per diem
right so so I understand where
brought up I just don't I don't
like to personally surrender my
power so I I would have to
submit about knowing that
strictly for that and thank you
madam chair thank you Mr speaker
I'm sorry.
Gentleman friends my questions
thank you.
There's further debate the
gentleman from Dona Ana grants
and Sierra counties
representative press.
Thank you madam speaker.
The gentleman from Bernalillo
ons on the left counties please
you are speaker I yield to the
gentle.
Yes.
Madam speaker a.
So then my question is how do
you use is I guess part of the
appointed commissions
discussions other having these
discussions and that they
haven't had on because it's as
it happened but.
Is are they going to include
Well let's start with this Madam
speaker
gentleman has a discussed or
have you guys have any ideas of
what the sellers maybe.
Madam speaker gentleman out.
you madam speaker well gentleman
so we have no idea that's.
Five thousand dollars or a
hundred thousand dollars Mr
chairman that's correct we're
not anywhere close to that yet
we're talking about voters
deciding whether there should
even be a commission once that
happens on the legislature gets
to meet on the kind of issues in
your discussed in terms of
parameters for Ontario.
Thank you madam speaker a so
then I just I I thought that
would might be some discussions
of what would be practical it's
this was to pass and that's why
you know if voters asked it goes
up to the to the voters of New
Mexico I just thought they might
want to be concerned or they may
be concerned is the legislature
at the end of this going to make
a lot of money or just and what
is a lot of money to one person
may not be to another and just
have an idea what that would be
Madam speaker of German.
Is there gonna be any
conversations about
reimbursements I I heard some
other things about staff and so
forth
but.
Is that gonna.
Is it going to be any
discussions concerning
reimbursements for travel or
anything secretary Madam speaker
gentleman if you look at the
Our constitution revision it
says John Stephenson women's
showers so that's what we're
talking about and so the short
answer is that you commissioners
rest really will be up to the
legislature.
Madam speaker gentle man thank
you I just wondered if with
salaries that would that would
change a little bit.
with reimbursements for you know
travel and state building that
we're we're coming up to the
legislature so madam speaker
gentle man one more quick I
got to learn to work which is
all the other question I have
is.
And added sugar John I tried if
you look at pararescue you'll
see and I think it was further
fleshes out the answer your
question it says the public
officers our commissioned
Charles thousand charities the
first full pay period and and
July twenty twenty four and
every two years or after taking
into account any other
compensation
requisites allowance
reimbursements let you take that
into account what's the salaries
that they would be sent.
Thank you madam speaker
gentleman's so the.
Question I have is this possibly
gonna change the session on what
we need you know we're we're
talking about a sixteen of
thirty nine million talking
about you're talking about
becoming a more professional.
Hi the legislature of the words
used Madam speaker John right so
with that possibly change we're
we're here full time every other
month you have any ideas what
type of discussions I would be
concerned that Madam speaker
gentleman that would have to
happen with the separate
constitutional amendment in fact
one of them is being proposed by
your minority went to change the
session from sixty and thirty to
forty five and forty five so
that that has to be a separate
constitutional moment that's not
this.
Thank you madam speaker
gentleman I appreciate that so
one last question is is there
possibly by the appointed
commissions do you think they're
going to discuss.
Anything like term limits.
Speaker John that's not part of
their that's part of this
constitutional provision I think
the short answer is no I and
they're not empowered to do
that.
Thank you madam speaker
gentleman I just figured we're
going to get a salary there may
be some discussion about term
limits thank you very much the
only questions I have
appreciated published.
There's further debate the
gentleman from Chavis adding
Tero.
Peter Townsend.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentleman yield master gardener
later.
Was there any thought
and entertaining.
NCSL or C. S. G. or a body that
is.
That.
Interacts with every legislature
across the country and
incorporate the best management
practices that they have seen
demonstrated Madam speaker John
I have actually looked at some
of that there are vibrant three
articles and happy to share with
you madam cell
this I and I think it's fair to
say this is recommended this
kind of commission to have
something independent but it is
also something in terms of
management tools that the
commission to apply I mean I I
would say Madam speaker John
look at how and I think
pleasantly surprised we are by
the professionalism of the
ethics commission and my hope
would be we don't all agree with
everything the others commission
does certainly is been very
professional my hope would be
that this commission would apply
those same kind of professional
management tools to their
discussions but we don't know
here.
Mr speaker are madam speaker
excuse me and John
I think we all in this body have
Grips with the fact that.
The legislature has
Been woefully in adequate.
In addressing the needs of our
state and I don't mean that
disrespectfully.
I'm just saying when you look at
all of our metrics.
We constantly are.
What I would consider less than
adequate.
So I am I am
I am absolutely in term and on
board.
With making the needed changes.
To address.
And Representative are
constituents better.
Any things that my friend from
Travis county center spot on as
far as I'm concerned as far as.
Not having offices on
legislative aides that kind of
stuff but the part of this
legislation on the reason that I
voted against it committee.
Was because I did not believe
that this legislation protected
us.
From.
Eight.
A decision.
That we might not agree with us.
And it bothered me.
Whether it was right or wrong in
rating some of the analysis.
That said that this body.
My age.
Make financial decisions Madam
speaker and on.
That this body.
In jeopardy.
And I'm interested in.
In the enabling the station
discussion.
Because that may have been the
piece that I missed.
But.
Let's say.
Hypothetically Madam speaker of
the this.
Group comes back in and then
salaries that cost ten million
dollars yes Representative
numbers.
And next year we're to the
point.
For the year the first year that
this is an active we're back to
where we were in sixteen sweep
on.
Education cash balances from
schools all across the Mexico.
Protect ourselves from that and
that that enabling this.
Process does that please explain
it to me so.
Mister John so for example I'm
just to take one example there's
a state that actually when the
recession here reduced the
salaries of legislators as a
result of their commission
process that happened in
California where they actually
reduced it because of the
recession so that can happen and
I think that's what the trick
going in the right so madam
speaker gentle and.
That's where this legislature's
sitting here in twenty twenty
three is going to have to figure
out how do we do this to where
we have a policy objective of
having an independent body
setting our showers while the
same time jealously guarding our
powers Madam speaker gentleman
you know.
When it comes to legislative
powers I am all in on keeping
those legislative powers verses
the executive branch said that
publicly I will continue to say
that but there is a good policy
reason for why this should be
independent.
The the the flip side of that
would be we would be setting our
own showers.
And I am someone is very in tune
to those kinds of conflicts we
should not be setting arms out
so this is the only way that I
can see to do this.
It's fair to the public while
the same time passing parameters
that will protect our budget
from a commission that I can't
imagine but a commission that
would be you'd say well they
would just be spent which we
don't want that but we went
there is a good policy goal of
removing that conflict was
setting arm challenge I don't
like that and that's why I think
the commission should be under.
Well Madam speaker and John I I
I agree with that I think they
should be under pandemic I'm
afraid that what we're doing is
not independent.
And and yes
It is.
Political elected officials
making decisions.
On their appointments that may
not be totally independent.
And so that's why I was when I
voted against the sink Committee
and and and where I where I
struggled laws.
I was for the process I am for
the process but I think.
A group like NCSL CST west
someone that sees all of the.
All of the legislators work in
the C. the structure that makes
it work.
I think that has a lot of merit
but when you just go pick other
people.
From within the same group that.
And I don't mean this
disrespectful but it's like you
have on the loose and football
team and have on the coach.
It.
The next line of starters.
You probably not gonna play any
better than we did last.
And that's why I was thinking
asked wouldn't it be good to get
a fresh set of eyes.
From.
From far off that had the
exposure to the.
Fifty plus legislators
legislatures.
And said the non a little bit of
the just a little bit of that.
Might make it New Mexico so that
is my issue with this
But I'm all in on the process we
gotta do something I just think.
We should go to a winning team
in order to make our choices
thank you madam speaker and
Representative.
The gentle lady from Eddy County
Representative Brown.
Thank you very much Madam
speaker will the gentleman from
Bernalillo and Sandoval to see
you.
Madam speaker I will yield to
the gentle lady.
Thank you very much matter state
Madam speaker and gentleman.
I'm looking at the legislative
drafting manual and it says here
that if a constitutional
amendment if there is a joint
resolution passes the
legislature
it goes to the people for
approval and only the title of
the constitutional amendment
would appear on the ballot.
Meeting that's all the voter has
to go by when trying to decide
how to vote.
So
Madam speaker and gentleman I
I'd like to talk about that for
just a little bit the importance
of the title of of the
resolution because it's all the
voters going to have to go by.
It says also in the manual that
the it's incumbent upon the
drafter to craft a title that
clearly and fairly let's the
voter know what the amendment
does.
also Madam speaker John there's
a little bit of a something that
that kind of raised my eyebrows
here it says that is true but
the drafter show craft.
A title that clearly and fairly
what's the better know what you
meant does unless the requestor
request an obscure title.
so
Madam speaker gentle but I I
know you did not draft this it
was done by someone in our
council service but I just
sounded strange of that little
County art is in there but would
like to go on to the bill title
for house joint resolution
twelve and I have a couple
questions Madam speaker
gentleman.
So it starts by saying proposing
to amend the constitution of New
Mexico by creating a public
officer salary commission to
establish in the limit.
The salaries of elected state
officers and so forth so.
Madam speaker gentlemen when it
says to establish the salaries
of elected state officers are
you thinking of and then it also
system limit and I'm I'm looking
up the words and limit and
wondering if you were
contemplating a salary range for
any of these positions Madam
speaker and gentle lady just to
be clear just tell the body
knows I was not involved in the
drafting the time so we're not
playing around with the title to
purposes the balance and I know
you weren't suggesting that but
I want to make clear I was not
involved in that and nor what I
do but the short answer is no we
don't know what salary should be
sacked but it is correct to say
that the commission was
established and women's salaries
of elected state officials and
other public officers as
provided by law that would be
correct.
And Madam speaker John was so I
I think it's highly unusual that
we would consider setting for
example the salary range for
governor.
or for any of these other
positions and it does provided
the resolution that the
The commission would review
salaries every two years and so
I just think that just to
establish means to set.
And when we add the words and
limit I think I think we're
trying to.
Not being really clear what what
this resolution would do.
And so I think voters I think
it's
it's really not a secret that
there are a lot of folks don't
really like politicians or
elected officials and I think a
lot of voters will jump at the
opportunity to vote in favor
when they see the words and
limit even though I believe the
way this is structured that's
not really
not really the case that it
would limit again at the word
the key word is established but
let me move on.
Madam speaker gentle less so the
next Clause talks about
repealing the constitutional
provision providing for
legislative per diem and mileage
and the prohibition provided
compensation.
Madam speaker and gentlemen so I
think that's the whole what
information for us that's
actually but you can choose a
lot of people when they read
this bill title on your ballots.
If we were trying to be clear
works there we would just break
that into two pauses that work
would be more easily understood.
And so I think the better way is
to say repealing the
constitutional provision
providing for legislative per
diem and mileage so Michael and
reviewing the constitution
provision prohibiting provided
compensation.
and then finally on the bill
titled Mr speaker and gentleman
that west of tradition I think
it's it's really very vague and
I don't think people know what
they're voting for so kind of in
the spirit of truth in
advertising I I would like to
see this bill title made more
plain English and madam speaker
gentleman's most people in New
Mexico do not know that
legislators are not paid except
for per diem and mileage.
They they assumed were paid and
some people assume more pay too
much there were rate zero
basically.
So
I just wish this time were were
a little bit better I think
there'd be ways to improve it to
as we say in the drafting annual
have a title that clearly
unfairly lets the voters know
what the amendment does.
Mr speaker program speaker
gentle but I I want to read a
little bit here just briefly
from the P. small then that
booklet to the constitution of
New Mexico.
As we all know we achieved
statehood in nineteen twelve and
this booklet is correct to be
here twenty fourteen.
And it talks about
and I think this is really true
that New Mexico voters
traditionally.
Are less interested in
constitutional amendments than
they are in the selection of
public officers.
And it suggested that one
explanation for this might be
the difficulty of understanding
some of the complicated
proposals placed on the ballot
with only a brief that would
tighten to act as a guide.
So here we are again I think
expressing my concern about this
resolution that there's just not
much for the voters to go by.
It is true that the full
amendments will be printed in
the legal of a section of
newspapers but it's my
experience that very few voters
are familiar with this portion
of the newspaper and they do not
read it for one thing the print
is usually very small.
we also know that the
Legislative Council Service does
produce or publish a summary of
constitutional amendments.
But it's not very widely
distributed in my opinion it's
sometimes it goes to the
internet and also the secretary
of state and we given to voters.
Speaker gentle actively with the
state that sends a voter guide
that explains all all these
proposals to every single voter
on the voter rolls and I think
that is really more scared to
the voters that they they easily
have access to our information
to help them understand that the
voting on.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
The issue of compensation for
legislators and I know that's
just part of this resolution but
that question has gone to New
Mexico voters twenty times since
in the state.
I believe we started off with
per diem of five dollars in the
very beginning.
And it wasn't until nineteen
forty four that that per diem
was raised to ten dollars.
It took a few years nineteen
fifty three it went to twenty
dollars.
And eighteen years passed until
it was increased to forty
dollars and then again eleven
years later in nineteen eighty
two it was raised to seventy
five.
And so we waited religious with
another fourteen years before
the voters actually chose I
thought it was a really good
solution to not having to come
back and keep amending the
constitution but they fix the
per diem rate allowable for
Santa Fe in the Internal Revenue
Service rules and that's where
we are today.
It's been suggested madam
speaker gentleman that
You know twenty submissions to
the voters and that frequent
initiatives might have a gradual
educational value and that that
may be true.
but in this case I I think it's
going to boil down if this
passes and goes to the ballot
that you will a lot depends on
the mood of the voters and again
the utility of the bill title of
the resolution title because I
think that's where.
We're going to lose a lot of
people and often times
if they're reading a long title
like this one and they don't
really understand it often times
they just don't know because
they're not gonna support
something they don't understand.
So.
All speaker John when I just
wanted to provide a little bit
history here and
I think you are I think and I
hope that this resolution would
benefit from some editing before
before it out.
Well it'll probably the house
tonight but before it leaves the
Senate thank you madam speaker
German thank you for allowing me
to make a few comments.
There is further debate the
gentleman from Bernalillo Santa
Fe Torrance Valencia counties
Representative McQueen.
Thank you madam speaker Madam
speaker Tallman does the
gentleman yield.
Are we on the gentleman.
Mr speaker and gentleman
I'd like to make a couple
comments having listened to the
debate and having heard similar
debates before for Salt Lake
City I agree with the gentleman
from San Juan who said that he
felt there should be a non
partisan issue.
in I do agree with that.
Unfortunately I think our
canyons of this resolution
diverge at that point.
The madam speaker Tallman I
believe that elected officials
should be paid a fair salary.
And that includes us thanks is
our judges thank you to our
governor regardless of party.
In Mr Chairman.
Politics gets in the way of
that.
We're really bad and salaries.
Mr Tillman I haven't told you
this but.
I got an email not from a
constituent but from a resident
of New Mexico criticizing me for
one of my bills.
And he somehow managed to go on
a tangent and attacked you for
this bill.
because you were trying to get
yourself a salary.
Apparently unaware that you
financed you're not running for
reelection.
And that's a point I just kind
of the politics that's involved
in in in money and Mr speaker
gentleman a few years ago
lower colleagues across the
aisle here introduced a bill to
pay
resolution I remember that the
text of it but one of our
Republican members introduce
something the rate the
legislature's.
And we.
Because that's what we do
because it's politics.
Mr speaker gentleman.
If we pay our judges we will get
better judges of our judicial
system is flawed because you get
appointed in any run for
election.
And so to become a judge now yes
we call you see qualified but
then you still have to Campine
in the political.
campaign.
Anybody went.
So you shut down your practice.
You.
Get rid of all your clients
you're on the bench for a year
year and a half maybe.
And then what what happens when
you lose
you know so the fact that people
have to shut down the practice
for an underpaid job yeah that's
a problem.
Mr speaker no speaker I
apologize then speaker John and
if we paid the legislators.
Our legislature.
Will be younger.
Will be more diverse and I will
be more representative of the
state of New Mexico.
Because you know as much as I
appreciate my colleagues then
speaker John.
We are not representative of the
state of New Mexico and that's
quickly.
Mr speaker
You know the gentleman from
Chavis and Lincoln and one other
County.
He was concerned that we might
be moving too quickly.
and Mr speaker I definitely
disagree with that.
You Mr speaker John this is way
overdue.
And Mr Chairman I am genuinely.
Grateful to you especially given
your position that you're on the
way out for taking on this this
this task of trying to get this
through the legislature and
getting into the others only the
voters decide.
So I appreciate your work on
this effort but I fully
supported.
And this is a good thing for the
state of New Mexico.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you so.

system.
And they can only deliver of.
Deliver beer and wine.
The three hundred feet from a
school or church we have
maintained that it's it's a lot
for restaurants and the
restaurants but not for the Kerr
stores.
We removed our friends in the
minority will like this mystery
here we remove the George
Washington two percent whiskey

Etcetera Linda Lopez proposed an
amendment was passed by the
Senate for prohibiting the sale

social cost of miniatures those
would be prohibited.
McKinley County Senator when you
also proposed an amendment that
was passed that prohibits gas
stations from selling
Of the spirits and wine to go
only so this in McKinley county
and this will I think with
market forces will incentivize

to move.
We're treating something like
any other day like every other
states Sunday is treated like
any other day and the department
of health is
It's going to do a study
impacting this this bill on
consumption trends and public
safety.
And with that Mr speaker I I
move that the house concur with
sentiments to house bill two
hundred fifty five as amended.
Seven times this does not have a
tax the two percent consumer tax
was struck by the Senate and and
and it was a friendly amendment
on behalf of co sponsors.

Leo has explained the Senate
amendments act has taxation
revenue can be sent to present
to content I.
He has been a motion for the
house to concur in this urged
the body to vote yes there is
debate the gentleman from Chavis
and Lincoln representative
Nibert.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman from Bernalillo county
yield.
Mr speaker yes Mr speaker and
gentleman you you mentioned
there was a floor amendment that
prohibited the sale of spirits
and aid gas that is not my
question as we have many
convenience stores around the
state that have liquor licenses
that sell spirits would then
have to divest themselves of the
liquor license to continue to
sell gasoline products.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman from.
From Chavis I'm glad you asked
that question that is strictly
for McKinley County.
I was strictly for McKinley
County as you recall Mr speaker
German
What the licenses moved around
and we're and there was a quota
on liquor licenses McKinley
County for whatever reason ended
up with a disproportionate
amount of liquor license.
So there's more alcohol sold in
our county per person that
directly anytime in the country.
So this appropriate here it's
only in McKinley county gas
stations to sell spirit so at
that point they would have a
choice they can not do anything
and just sell beer at the gas
stations or they can do
something else with their
license the amendment and Senate
Judiciary allows that license
holder to sell that license
outside of McKinley County
retain the package component of
the license and maintain its
incredibly high market value.
Mr speaker and gentleman thank
you for that answer I'm not sure
good public policy to have one
County different than the rest
but
that's what very ask for guess
what from here.
The gentle lady from Santa
Representative Powdrell Culbert.
Thank you ms from Bernalillo Mr
speaker yes I will you.
this gentleman you said
Amendments to the that would
have to be a credible or
sophisticated I do shown.
What is that.
Thank you Mr speaker generated
from Santa so.
On delivery on delivery that
deliver has to be twenty one
years of age just like a
bartender and and the purchaser
must show an ID.
With those big box stores
there's been there was a huge
debate whether to include and
exclude all included exclude
And so we decided up on
sentiment senator member number
one that indoor retail space
greater than ten thousand square
feet in size located within a
classic County.
May be issued are now called
delivery permit yes yes and then
there's several things that the
license holder uses
identification verification
system.
That no spirits liquors are
included deliveries so just very
line.
The liquor liability is a five
million dollars as opposed to a
one million dollars I suppose
because of the volume of
potential delivery.
And that that they are not maybe
using a third party alcohol
delivery service that I think
this was a compromising spear of
of of large out of state
companies completely dominating
the delivery market.
Okay this is German I appreciate
all that information but are we
still at the same point we have
always been you start talking
about identification.
Thank you Mr speaker DeLeo not
all we sure as heck are we sure
as heck are you must show
identification on all deliveries
in this bill.
All the deliveries Mr speaker
then all the recipients our
records on.
Are still the same my point be
is that anyone can get a that
are not be.
Right now there's still no way
in the process to show.
That is definitely my ID.
Thank you Mr job generations out
of all know excellent point and
I forgot to follow up you don't
just need an I. D. you need to
prove that you're twenty one and
older using that identity card
so with this provision of they
have to swipe that that I do and
that will should prove the
validity of the identification
card thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman.

strengthens the office of

courts that supervise
guardianships and better monitor

guardians for incapacitated
adults.
Mr speaker we have a floor
amendment would you.
Of for for that I introduce that
now or at some other point
that's fine gentle lady and I've
got to go to number two two zero
six four five point two is that
correct that is correct Mr
speaker can generate leads the
amendment and explained.
Mr speaker I move the amendment
and the amendment does several
things it to eight section
fourteen of the original bill
which contained an appropriation
to the office a guardianship and
to the New Mexico Supreme Court.
The remaining amendments are
primarily for clarification
of several of them relate to the
contents of the annual report
the office of guardianship will
be providing as part of the of
additional
supervision and information and
transparency in the bill
also clarification about the
timing and role of the state
auditor's office in conducting
audits vertically can in
connection with conservative
ships
the adoption of a very excellent
suggestion for representative
Nibert during the committee
hearing to shorten and improve a
paragraph and so with that I
would
it not sure do I I guess I stand
for question on the amendment at
this point Sir.
Mr speaker.
Representative are the gentleman
from Chavis and Lincoln are you
debating the bill argument.
Is there debate on the
amendment.
Is there direction to the
amendment.
See non house.
Affirmative number one.
Our house bill up to thirty for
the doctor.
Thank you at Madam speaker I'm
sorry I I'm I'm not seeing on my
zoom who the speaker is and so I
did not mean to Mr dress you
and this is Madam speaker
members of the house
As I indicated before this is a
and eight H. B. two thirty for
strengthening the office of
guardianship.
R. in terms of both the office
and the role of the Courts in
guardianships and with that we
would stand for questions.
There is debate on the bill the
gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln representative Nibert.
Thank you madam speaker what
we're gentle lady from
Bernalillo county yields.
Madam speaker gentleman I yield.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady.
Madam speaker gentle lady as as
you know I have the a number or
raised a number of concerns
about this legislation and
R. committee Judiciary Committee
other that.
And madam speaker and gentle
lady just through
let you know I have had fairly
lengthy discussions with.
Miss McCoy is the executive
director for the developmental
disabilities planning council
and she has gone over the bill
with me and has alleviated many
of the concerns that I brought
up during that process Madam
speaker gentle lady I appreciate
your
making some amendments that
dealt with some language of I
think it's a better.
It's more properly worded and
appreciate that I also raised
some concerns regarding it's a
impact all minors children.
And
miss McCoy has has told me that
that this legislation does not.
Binders of anyone this
legislation only goes for
Adult.
Individuals who need our
guardians appointed and go
through a court appointed
guardianship proceeding and so
that alleviated some of the
concerns that I expressed.
With respect to some other
issues that I have is for us was
the definition of professional
guardian.
And that was the number of
people that that one could be a
guardian for without triggering
the various requirements that a
professional guardians required
to under Ted.
And after going through the bill
with miss it and going through
the existing statute
I have come around on that issue
and
Well I I still think we need to
be careful because we want to.
Address the concerns.
Of people taking advantage of
the principal.
The person who is subject to the
guardianship.
And at the same time not budget
so onerous on individuals that
they would not step up to the
plate and become a guardian.
so.
After after that lengthy
discussion
Madam speaker and gentle lady I
am.
We're convinced that the.
This legislation is crafted to
deal with with the the issues
that you're you're renting part
of that is to provide as I
understand it find some
oversight of the guardianship
itself and number two.
Basically require the courts to
engage and.
An annual review of that
guardianship to make sure that
the principle is being well
cared for by the guardian and so
madam speaker and gentle lady my
question would be do I now have
a better understanding of the
intent of this legislation.
Your muted.
Madam speaker gentleman I yes I
think that you have an excellent
understanding of the legislation
thank you.
And and madam speaker and gentle
lady just for the edification of
the body could you kind of go
into some of the provisions that
you happen this legislation to
provide that oversight by
independent parties and then
secondly what's required of the
court to
do its annual review.
Speaker
Gentleman yes I would be happy
to do that
this.
The process requires the the
office a guardianship is like an
office of legal services it
provides the services that of
people who need to have
guardianship of and and ranges
for that goes to the court and
seeks the appointment
there's guardian ad light items
there's a whole process of
people involved in that decision
making situation but the key
thing is that the guardian of
course is appointed by the
court.
and that means for the court to
properly assess how will the
guardianship is being performed
means that the court has to have
information and the court relies
upon of the office a
guardianship to some extent to
provide that information and
what this bill does is
essentially really strengthen
that process it it doesn't do
several items our service
several ways I should say and
one of the key ways is of first
of all it added it just language
that makes it clear that if a
guardian is not performing their
duties as they should they can
be removed by the court
that language was not in there
before and now that language is
spare it sets a standard of
performance.
Secondly
in order to be sure that the
guardian is doing what they need
to be doing in fulfilling their
their duties there has to be
someone taking a look at what
they're doing the guardian
prepares a and and I was an
annual reports about twenty
pages long but will it also
happens under this
Legislation is of there is a
court volunteer program a court
visitor volunteer program.
And what that in this it is
going to be piloted in three
judicial districts to increase
the role of the court volunteers
the court visitors and what's
what's going to happen in those
pilot in that pilot area is it
the court visitor will actually
meet with the protected person
the person who is subject to the
guardianship will review the
reports will submit their own
report as to the sufficiency of
the guardianship including I
think this is important that the
least restrictive of.
Environment is is being used in
in connection with the protected
person are protecting their
rights to the extent that is
appropriate in the particular
guardianship and then
There will now be a E. A. P.
individuals within employees
within the court system whose
job will be to review those
reports and be sure that the
judge is made aware if there is
any problem in the performance
of the guardian and that will
strengthen the system
dramatically
as a city beginning the court
can't fix problems if it's not
aware of problems and this
system is now going to be
designed to be sure that the
court has the information it
needs to be able to act if there
are problems in the guardianship
arrangement.
Thank you.
Madam speaker gentle lady thank
you for about the overview and
then the as I understand it
Madam speaker gentle lady the
court requires a an annual
review report is submitted to
the court and this bill
requires a court to then review
that report and act
appropriately up on it is that
is not an accurate understanding
of the procedures set forth in
this legislation.
Madam speaker gentleman at yes
and and there is also the report
as indicated from the court
visitor the volunteer person.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
could you maybe discuss a little
bit about the role of the family
because we're talking about
professional guardians and
special guardians are defined as
a non family member so we're not
talking about a guardian who is
a family member we're talking
about the no related party
that's acting in the role of a
guardian so you could you talk a
little bit about the role of
those files or the other family
members and their ability to
find some oversight or have
input into this proceeding.
Then Madam speaker and gentleman
thank you for the question.
Guardianship is it's a little
bit like probate is something
you you you want to avoid and if
there are family members who are
available to care for and work
with and the protected person of
theirs their family members who
who is becoming or is someone in
capacitate it then
There will not ever be a need
for a formal guardianship
proceeding there are many
different ways through health
directives to powers of attorney
of through it just a number of
different ways that families can
avoid ever being in a situation
where there is a a guardianship
guardianship frequently happens
monthly it most likely is to
happen in two circumstances one
is where there is no one who can
fulfill that role and that
person needs to be have somebody
available as a decision maker
and as a protector.
Up the other is where the family
members can't agree aware of
one set of family members may
think mom should come to that be
with them in California and
dispels or the other sibling or
whoever says no and the family
is in is in capable of reaching
an agreement in order to
determine what is best for their
loved one.
And and I wanted to emphasize
that I'm not in in the least
suggesting that people are.
are not loving toward their
toy there often eight it may not
always but often an aging parent
but
they just see things differently
they can't agree and there has
to be a decision maker and when
that occurs then often your
there's going to be a a petition
for guardians of in order to.
Be sure that the that the
incapacitated person up has
someone who is able to make
those decisions for them.
And.
This as I say it's it's not the
situation anybody really wants
to get into
a lot of times would working
with the state attorneys and and
so forth you can do a lot of
documentation so that for
example the person before they
become incapacitated can
actually indicate who they would
like to a power of attorney to
make decisions for them and so
forth so
we we we always encourage people
to look at those alternatives up
but when those are two
alternatives aren't there
they're not working Madam
guardianship comes into play.
Thank you.
Madam speaker and gentle lady on
I'm pleased that you highlighted
some of the facts that you just
stated and I certainly would
would reiterate.
What you just stated that these
guardianship proceedings for the
elderly really ari and last
The last course of events
hopefully all parties would
avail themselves to.
Other legal mechanisms to take
care of them the person and
their finances well before they
get to a state where they are
incapacitated and unable to to
make decisions on their own and
then subject to maybe a court
appointed guardianship receiving
them and so for those few that
maybe listen up this late hour I
too would echo your remarks that
the you people don't have those
things and employees I really
need to do so because
I think you're you're
observation medicines I a last
ditch effort this is a the
effort of of last resort
certainly rings true with with
my experience and and certainly
would be I would echo your your
comments we.
You mentioned that the
Members took out the
appropriation yeah my question
will be yes there's no
appropriation will these
functions and will the
implementation of the provisions
in this bill be able to be
implemented without the
appropriation portion of it
being struck.
Madam speaker gentle on.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes we
we took the appropriation out of
the house bill
my understanding is that and
we've been in touch with the
Senate that of the funding will
be added back in to the Senate
process this is H. B. two had
already been approved in the
house.
Madam speaker gentle lady thank
you for that clarification
Madam speaker and gentle lady by
the
One last
question are there may be
several questions here but my
last issue that I'd like to
discuss will be the term the
least restrictive.
And you know when I look at that
these types of proceedings and
and say the word least
restrictive.
In in my mind the court has to
make the determination whether
this person is capable of
handling their affairs or they
are not.
There is a capable or they're
not and so
when when I say the words waste
restrictive in here could you
discuss maybe a little bit as to
what the real impact of those
words are because I don't think
it goes to the issue of whether
the person is capable or not
capable the court has to make a
determination they're not
capable of handling their own
affairs and gardens at all but
could you talk about the impact
of those words waste restrictive
that we see in several places in
this legislation.
It speaker and gentleman again
thank you for that question
because of that a couple points
I'd like to make first of all
every guardianship border is
customized it is customized to
the situation of the protected
person and there ARE.
There is not a formal order that
is used is based upon what the
capacity of the particular
person is
and some people are.
Totally incapacitated though
that's usually not too often the
case but it does happen and some
are only incapacitated answered
levels so first of all the
orders are customized.
this is the second the second
point I would like to make is
that
It I just forgot it.
it could you give me an Mr Mr
speaker
Speaker and gentleman could you
repeat your question so I can
remember the second part of my
answer sorry yes ma'am.
Madam speaker gentle lady the
the works least restrictive and
help those would be applied by
the guardian in performing their
duties to the
Protected person.
Madam speaker and gentleman
thank you so much for that eight
restricting is
that and this is this is an
important point and and I can't
believe I kind of just spaced
out.
Adult most of rights they and if
their rights are going to be
restricted
of it has to be through a court
proceeding and it has to be
based on their in capacity and
so least restrictive in this in
terms of a guardianship really
is focusing on what in terms of
their living arrangements in
terms of their decision making
in terms of all of those kinds
of things the their physical
freedom and so forth it's what's
least restrictive giving given
their in capacities so.
Just for example
it may be that someone
of needs
help with housekeeping need
somebody to check in with them
once a day to be sure they're
eating of.
But doesn't need somebody to be
with them twenty four hours a
day is and they're comfortable
with having some independence
that would be an example of a
least restrictive situation
again.
These results and.
To restrict their freedom to
risk restrict what they can do
and what decisions they can make
for themselves we have to be
very careful in doing that and
we have to be sure that if we're
doing it is because it really is
necessary and not just
convenient for an easy way to
take care of somebody who is
growing all.
And madam speaker gentle lady I
appreciate those comments and so
this legislation is really
designed to allow the not only
the court but but basically to
tell the the guardian that they
need to judge the competency of
the person they're in charge of
the project person and to give
them
the most freedom that that is
capable of being exercised with
that for them without the.
Endangering our baby causing
them to suffer some
consequences I appreciate that
and I I think that's the engine
Madam speaker and gentle lady
My following comments are are a
question for you but I do want
to address.
Some issues that we heard
during the public comment.
Regarding our guardianships and
and I really take to heart of
some of the the issues that were
raised and and.
You know we we heard some
comments that their parents or
or loved one was really taken
advantage of by a guardian and
took all the money in and you
know there was no recourse and
I'm Madam speaker and gentle
lady
I listen to some of that money
thinking why.
Why would those people not avail
themselves of the legal system
because the legal system is
there to to deal with those
types of issues and I'm sure
that there are plenty of lawyers
that if somebody's.
Wealth got taken from them by
unscrupulous guardian that would
be records and and ready records
and so I didn't quite follow
some of those concerns
I think the state is doing
everything possible to try to
put into place.
Protections so that the people
who would services court
appointed guardians professional
guardians as defined in this
legislation.
Are people who can be trusted
and I and I believe that they
you know they're subject to the
court and the court's
jurisdiction
yeah and I believe the
legislation we passed a year ago
may even require some bonding or
something but
I just would encourage people
that think that their loved one
is getting taken advantage of by
guardian that they raise those
issues I don't sit back and just
watch it happen and I think this
legislation is designed to
address some of those concerns
and so somebody sees something
that's not.
Making sense or or see some
impropriety I need to raise that
issue and not wait for for years
ago they need to raise it as of
the pros and and like I said the
madam speaker and gentle lady I
don't have a question about
regarded just as frustrating
from my standpoint that people
sit back to watch the stuff
happened without raising
objections for the benefit of
their loved one and maybe for
the benefit of themselves and we
do have a legal system that's
supposed to address of signs
that your people are being taken
advantage of Madam speaker and
gentle lady thank you for the
time you give me the answer my
questions and the thank you for
this legislation of our I really
appreciate the support sitting
down made for probably an hour
today going through all this and
and appreciate the time that she
spent.
Thank you madam speaker.
There's further debate the
gentle lady from requests are
granted although and Sierra
Representative Dow thank you
madam speaker will the gentle
lady please yep.
Go to very extreme measures
writing weekly letters to the
editor involving news and trying
to gain access to their loved
ones who had been taken into
guardianship against the
family's wishes so I I know that
it happens although I don't
quite understand you know why
they're not availing themselves
to this legal process if if
they're if they're able it might
be a financial reason but madam
madam speaker and gentle lady I
guess my questions I'm looking
at the amendment in context and
I'm wondering on page seven on
the line eight
section eight the requirement
that contractors and their staff
meeting nationally recognized
standards for guardianship
Services not lying was struck
and in the substitute they need
to be a member in good standing
of an association why would we
prefer that someone pay and be a
member in good standing of an
association rather than those
guardians meet nationally
recognized standards why was
that change.
Mr speaker at gentle lady.
I don't think it really has
changed but let me let me talk
just a console for a moment with
that with my experts who is
Alice makori who is the
executive director of the of the
guardianship office SO that I be
sure I give you an accurate
answers so if you just give me a
moment please.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
It then the changing language on
page seven is essentially kind
of a clean up the advantage of
requiring that they be certified
in good standing with the
national organization means that
not only they belong to one that
has a set of standards and so
forth but that they have passed
the test indicating that they
understand the standards and are
have and and and are are skilled
in performing those standards
thank you madam speaker and
thank you gentle lady on page
twenty three actually I think
I'm page twenty two start
talking about this and this
interdisciplinary network of
guardian stakeholders and it
looks like there will be no less
than nineteen members on that
list of nineteen members they
all seem to be government
employees are government we are
people who work in the system
other than there's a family
guardian and there's a family
member who is not a guardian or
conservator other protected
person Madam speaker and gentle
lady it seems like a whole lot
of bureaucrats and and people
working in the system at that.
Perhaps those who are concerned
about family guardian family in
their rights to their family may
feel that that's not being nasty
family representation where's
their discussion of adding more
family madam madam speaker point
of order.
State department justice kind of
loud.
Or do I say order.
Thank you thank you madam
speaker thank you gentle lady
was there discussion of adding
more family members and if that
didn't happen why.
Mr speaker gentle lady
This this program is called
wings and it is a national
program and so the basic
structure of it
is comes from that national
more.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady and again those
that national model wings are
the is it typical that the
Supreme Court in a point every
single member of that net
network every single member and
that the Supreme Court also run
the network I do that is that
how it works in other states.
Not
speaker gentle lady let me ask
my expert about that give me a
moment please.
Lady thank you for letting me
take a moment to be sure give
you accurate information
if this this model is fairly
standard were not aware that
it's not used elsewhere
And the reason that the reason
that the court so about this
because of course of the
ultimate
decision maker in this process
they are the people who
appointed guardians and they are
the people who if there's a
problem with the guardian are
going to have to address it in
terms of of a removal or
something like that
I would note that there's a fair
amount of discretion this
for the the court to appoint
additional members and my
understanding is that the way
that this often is done is that
this group I think it's actually
a part of this is actually in
statute in the bill
this large group would meet four
times a year and then of the
court the Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court could appoint
subgroups
working groups of have meetings
more frequently be very
responsive to the needs of.
This area of guardianship and of
and and AP and in order to keep
New Mexico.
Current with state of the art in
the in the field and also
current with what our local and
statewide needs are.
Thank you madam speaker in thank
you gentle lady and you
mentioned that they will need at
least four times a year are
those meetings going to be open
to the open meetings act.
Madam speaker gentle lady let me
double check I would assume so
but let me double check.
But that.
Madam speaker gentle lady at the
the the
People who are not members of
the group have been attending
the meetings that the court has
been having.
Madam speaker and gentle lady is
that a yes is the subject to the
open meetings act of.
Madam speaker gentle lady
without looking back at that
open meetings act I couldn't
tell you for sure how it applies
to courts but the practice has
been to make these meeting for
these meetings to be open thank
you madam speaker and thank you
gentle lady and and I think I
think the intent of this
legislation is good I have heard
from folks in my district that
are part of that a coalition of
Family guardianship and
conservatorship groups and that
they would like to see some
changes and I hope you know I
don't want to derail this bill
in with such a short time moving
forward and I trust that if
there is a necessary amendment
in the Senate side such as being
open to the subject meetings
deprivations or or other issues
that may come up that that you
page six that and I I have found
you to be available and
adjustable to these things at
the same token we need to ask
ourselves if our mother or uncle
or close family member was
forcibly placed in guardianship
without our knowledge without
our approval are the steps here
for us that we can help our
family members and I as a
representative confident enough
that I can go back to my
district and tell a New Mexicans
that would somebody need the
help of the guardianship for
themselves or a loved one to
trust New Mexico system and does
this legislation do enough to
not interfere with family
members who are caring for their
loved ones who are serving as
non professional guardians and
I'm not you know I don't I don't
know if we're there yet but I
appreciate the efforts and I I I
appreciate your intent of the
bill thank you madam speaker
thank you Representative.
There is a debate the gentle
lady from Bernalillo
Representative Armstrong.
Thank you madam speaker and will
the gentle lady from Bernalillo
yield.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
are you.
Thank you Madam speaker and
gentle lady and I rise really to
commend you to can
command
of the office of guardianship
and the courts and everyone for
coming together and doing the us
up it is a long time coming.
And I say that because twenty
years ago I testified at the
congressional select committee
on aging.
On the lack of oversight of
guardianship.
That's twenty twenty years ago
and I would say in answer to
the previous gentle lady I don't
think we've had a good system in
New Mexico and good oversight
there's been talk there's a lot
of good guardians and I'm not
disparaging I'm friends with
many of professional guardians I
think there's a lot of good ones
here there's also been very
gregis in the news
put people in in a way in
nursing homes and sell all their
things there's there's been
there's been agree just stop and
that work I've done in nursing
homes I've seen many people who
I or I should say many I've seen
individuals in the nursing home
who could have been and not
lesser restrictive environment
but their guardians
put them there and when they
lack capacity and a few laughs
family members of the court is
led to believe the guardian.
And so there is not in there is
not been
a system so and we had started
to I was talking with our courts
to create pilot programs fifteen
years ago just to even read the
annual reports that are
submitted to the courts there
wasn't a mechanism to read and
respond and do anything about if
a report wasn't filed if it was
appropriate there was no
visiting there was no oversight
to and that wasn't even the
professional guardians but this
bill just focuses on the
professional guardians I I
realize that and what
Madam speaker and gentle lady
what I particularly.
and I am happy to see in this
legislation is development of
the wings of program.
And that came out of it it's a
it's a partnership between the
court and community of
stakeholders around guardianship
of and so the US so many people
at the table but this came out
of recommendations of national
guardianship
organizations about the lack of
oversight and as I said I was I
wasn't in Congress speaking
about this twenty years ago.
And this has evolved as a model
of that has been adopted and I
believe about twenty five states
at this point in over the last
ten years or so it has
the American Bar Association is
playing up of all rural
and provided technical
assistance and help to states to
start our wings programs and
I think it's just been a long
time a long time coming and I
really applaud us getting to
this point I know we did a
couple years ago revamp of a lot
of our guardianship law but
there still wasn't adequate
oversight and we have seen very
agreed just basis in New Mexico.
Of
of inappropriate guardians and
so I I I do think and and again
there's there's great guardians
out there but without any
oversight
and without anyone looking over
a guardian so older the court
relies on the guardian.
And
it and so I anyways I think this
is a really really good start at
focusing on where the issues are
because part of the of this
group really is to look at what
what laws do we need what
purpose do we need what systems
do we need in place how to the
different.
community partners interplay and
and not taking care of and and
being sure that we're being
appropriate in our guardianship
as these
a professional guardians we have
a roll
with that in particular there's
there are guardians that we're
paying for as a state R. as
public guardian's when there's
no family and there is no
income I adequate to pay and
there's no.
The resources of the individuals
are there in and out of the
office of guardianship were we
are contracting for and and
paying
for guardians and we have a
responsibility I believe to
oversee and make sure that
that guardianship is appropriate
and we are doing least
restrictive
that's not always been true and
I can tell you as when I was
secretary of aging and and and
gauged in these activities
around guardianship and adult
protective services there's more
than one of contract for
guardians that we had to pull
yeah and so I I just rise in in
really strong support
of this legislation and the
direction that it's all of that
is taking but it it is dynamic
and out of this group will come
further our recommendations and
how we involve our system of
guardianship and caring for
those who are vulnerable and
without a capacity to care for
themselves so
thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady thank you for being
a champion for this and for
persevering through the many
amendments to this to
to bring it this far and hi
urged the body to to support
this this legislation thank you.
There is further debate the
gentle lady from Santa
Representative Powdrell Culbert.
There is further debate the
gentle lady from going on
Representative Ferrary.
Thank you
Madam speaker and gentle lady
will you yield.
Speaker I am pleased to yield to
have my co sponsor on this bill.
Thank you madam speaker and
representative I have been
Working on this for since I've
been elected with families who
have come to me about you know
having their loved ones who have
suffered the consequences of a
guardianship that went wrong and
some of them and their loved
ones were secluded and exploited
as a protected individual and
stolen from them of their
relatives or friends and their
quality of life so I'm really
glad and appreciate all the work
you as our as our sponsor has
put into working with this
legislation as well as director
Alice Lee clay and I hope this
will bring the needed changes
and the involvement of the men
further thanks to protect of our
elderly and adults in our state
