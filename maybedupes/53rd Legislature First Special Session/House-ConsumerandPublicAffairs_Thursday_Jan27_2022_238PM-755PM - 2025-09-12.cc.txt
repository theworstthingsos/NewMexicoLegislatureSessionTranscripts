This.
Is the
House consumer public affairs
committee I'm not sure when I
said that before we were

everyone
we have a full agenda today so
we appreciate if everyone can be
concise in their questions and
their answers then also when it
comes to
Public comment we are going to
have a timer of with one minute
and it looks like we have
hundreds of people we might have
to limit it to half an hour for
each side of will have to decide
that once we see how things are
going
so you might think about even
when we take the poll leading us
that lets us know everyone how
they
Support or oppose a bill to so
you might not need to feel
compelled to
give public comment and if you

valley into the beautiful
Espanola valley we also are
hosted for sovereign public yes
you can that central to fund so
and Pojoaque pueblo's thank you
madam chair.
Now we can see you that's great
all right our first bill this
afternoon in this house bill
seventy one and
Representative McQueen
has been tied up for like.
Four five six eight six hours on
Energy and natural resources
committee so Representative
Harper I hear you're going to be
presenting.
Madam chair that's correct I
think
We will try to join us a little
bit later but
Yeah he is he's had a long
morning.
thank you for
the option to present this bill.
I'm glad I'm going first
I'm I'm gonna do my best to keep
the introduction short.
the this bill does something
very simple but it's not
especially simple to understand
what the implications are in
fact a lot of people calling me
and yelling at me for being an
evil tax raising Republicans.
but the truth is this bill
doesn't do that.
and so let me let me explain it
the bill does and then I'll give
you a little bit of history a
very brief tax lesson.
And I think that will help us
understand what the bill is
actually going and then I'll be
happy to answer questions.
Okay so what this bill does is
right now in current law there
is a cap.
Of three percent every year that
property can increase in value.
There was this maybe when you
see your your your your your
statement from your your county
assessor
your value goes up three percent
every year essentially.
And what this bill does is it
says.
For.
Residential property that is
occupied as a principal place of
residence.
that continues.
There has to be occupied
principal place of residence.
If it's not.
This is on page two the the if
it's not in in section D. there
then that's three percent
changes to a ten percent.
Right.
so first.
Just so we're on the same page
this doesn't mean that property
automatically jumps up ten
percent or automatically jumps
up three percent this is the
limitation of how much it can
increase in a year.
So for example if you purchased
a brand new house and the value
didn't go up last year or you
know just a few years or
property values actually went
down.
This cap just means I can't
increase in value more than
three percent that's all that
means.
So people understand that that's
what the bill does.
Occupied principal residence
cases you percent cap.
If it's not.
It goes to ten percent.
Okay.
So why am I evil Republic
So what.
What's the real problem is here
is we have something in our
statutes called yield control
and if you read the FIR I mean
this FIR is really good at.
Yield control shows up in here a
lot.
Well you'll control is is is
actually the only statute in our
and all of our statutes to has
an equation and so you can
imagine I like it right
And was put in place in the
early seventies.
What I did what I did and if you
just wash my hands because I'm
I'm I'm gonna describe anyways
with my hands.
Property values do this right
they they just go probably does
go up and down up and down but
there are a lot of government
entities that require R. one
offer that valued by county
school districts and so to keep
their budgets from doing this up
and down up and down up and
down.
We put in yieldcontrolled was
almost right sings the
legislature did.
And all yieldcontrolled eyes
it's really simple when you look
at your question and I can walk
you through but all it does.
Is when property values do this.
The equation pumps out the same
amount of tax.
So just making sure that school
districts and counties
Representative property tax base
with the same out of tax every
year.
It doesn't have program is going
up or going down.
If the values are going up
what's the question does that
pushes the tax rate down.
So that you get the same
attacks.
Or provision going down.
It pushes the right up to get
the same amount of tax.
So this this is.
Right right
we should do something like this
for our own gas revenue right we
kind of try to have something
like that but anyway so
yieldcontrolled does this why is
this important.
Well back in two thousand.
there was a big
Efforts a big brouhaha about for
folks in Santa Fe cool being
priced out of their houses.
Right the property taxes are
going up and up and and this tax
lightning thing was happening
and and people were we're having
problems keeping up with our
property tax and so what the
legislature did was I said okay
Representative on this three
percent cap on valuation.
And also the problem.
And I was really easy
understanding of our past and
some of the law.
But it doesn't play well with
yield control.
it actually has a trainwreck was
yield control.
Because however what we don't
control does that just keeps the
same attacks and so now if
you've limited.
Value to three percent.
All you're doing is the stuff of
your control paying the same
amount of tax it's not helping
people pay less tax.
And in fact one of the
unintended consequences of this
was that commercial property
property that generates revenue
they now responded to this this
cap was really designed this
this budget was really designed
to help people not depressed
mothers helps and so now we have
all these I mean you look at the
F. I. R. I think it's like.
Three fourths of the property in
Santa Fe is not valued
correctly.
and so we look at this in the
revenue stabilisation tax policy
committee only introduction
here's ago when we look at all
of our tax codes.
And we recognize this tax
lightning issue and three
percent cap issue is a real
problem for property tax.
And so we.
as a committee decided we wanted
to remove this cap entire.
well that turned out to be a
real challenge.
And so what we're doing here in
this bill Representative McQueen
myself we're trying to undo a
couple years of that on the.
And we think these are kind of
the best years to unravel first.
Because what this bill really
does okay so so here's here's
the takeaway well this bill
really does.
Is for second homes.
Or for like European bees or are
better brexit bread breakfast.
They will no longer be subject
to the three percent cap.
Still have a ten percent so so
if they've been under fire for a
long time it's gonna take them
several years to get to the
correct value.
if they were just purchased
recently they already at current
Drexel's not affect them.
but there are there I will go
up.
And what does that mean.
That means is because of yield
control and those values are
going up.
They will play they will pay
slightly more tax.
But because you'll control hold
the tax basically steady that
means all of us primary
place of residence our personal
residence you actually end up
paying less tax because you'll
control foremost as you you pay
about the same amount so what
this really is and why I'm not
in the Republican.
This is.
I'm doing an unintended
consequence of the three percent
cap.
And giving every home owner
every principal place of
residence.
A slight tax caught.
And I'm happy to dive into
details and answer questions on
that but I've I've I also
understand that if I keep
talking people's eyes are gonna
place over so was that madam
chair.
I will stand for questions.
Okay thank you let's go to the
poll of those in the audience
And when you see the poll you
can vote in favor or in
opposition there is.
Okay we have the results well
it's pretty close fourteen and
in favor and thirteen in
opposition.
Okay.
So I.
We'll go ahead and go to the
audience those who are in
opposition if you would please
raise your hand only those in
opposition.
And then we will if you'd like
to speak if you don't need to
speak that's fine but those in
opposition who would like to
speak raise your hand.
Rob do we have anyone.
Yes madam chair okay.
Yes please and there is a one
minute timer.
Merion Maria de.
My hand.
Marian.
You're on mute he can you
yourself.
Okay and more yeah and if you
can and you yourself please.
Okay will come back to you.
Next person.
Randy trainer.
Thank you madam chair Rady
trainer representing the
apartment association in New
Mexico
I know you just for people in
opposition or in support on I
guess I find myself someone in
the middle here we've been
working on this bill for several
years with Representative
McQueen.
Open to him earlier in the fall
about this new language and I'm
really confused right now when I
read the FIR and I hear the
presentation by Representative
Harper and I. E. um look back on
my discussions with
Representative McQueen I'm very
confused of the term principal
place of residence a seems to be
at the center of this
it seems to me the way I'm
reading the FIR principal place
of residence is no different
than owner occupied which we
propose that and so the idea was
that I believe The presentation
by Representative McQueen to me
has been that I do not want to
capture multi family housing so
we just wanna make sure we all
understand each other and that
the language representative what
was at least Representative to
us and then we can decide where
we land on the bill thank you
very much.
Okay.
Less second Hey Anna.
Madam chair and Representative
Harper I appreciate your time
I'd like to echo we're anti
parameters thoughts on this we
truly appreciate working with
Representative McQueen over the
last year but we do have
concerns with the term principal
place of residence and we would
definitely like to see some more
clarification and a better
description or definition of
that included in the bill so
with that
let as Randy said we're we're
kind of on the fence about this
so I appreciate your time and
thank you very much.
Thank you next.
Carlos.
Hi madam chair members of the
committee on Carlos on tech with
the New Mexico business
coalition.
I.
I'm in the same position other
people are one of the things
that I want to say is I greatly
appreciate the Sanchez concern
for primary home owners at and
what has been happening with our
taxes one of the issues that we
have faced I've been in the same
home for ten years.
And the home I had prior even
during the Great Recession our
rates went up three percent
every year even when property
values were not going up except
for one year they were held
steady I was hoping that that
would be addressed because that
is a really big problem for
people here and I think that it
probably carries over on
commercial or non owner occupied
as well so that's my comment
thank you for your
consideration.
Brandt more.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee my name is Brent
more I am a registered lobbyist
for the New Mexico realtors
Association and the the realtors
respectfully oppose this
legislation we have
consistently had concerns about
this proposal and I would
address this to the committee I
understand that there's a desire
to try to get after second homes
sometimes that the examples
given second homes in Santa Fe
need to pay their fair share of
tax I understand that and I
respect the sincerity of
Representative McQueen and
Representative Harper but I
would pose this to the committee
sometimes second home owners are
necessarily folks who have lots
and lots of money sometimes they
are folks that why am on rental
income from the second home that
was a family home and those
folks are in this group as well
that's a tax increase on them
and for that reason The New
Mexico realtors oppose this
piece of legislation thank you
very much.
Madam chair that was the final
public comment in opposition.
Thank you I'm now if you are in
support of this bill if you
would please raise your hand and
all those who are in opposition
lower your hands.
Okay
Where we able to get Marian.
R. to mute.
Okay I guess not all right we'll
go ahead and the those in
support.
Please raise your hand.
Okay.
C. K. if you can unmute please.
I know you see Kay is that if
they would please I'm here and
go ahead and state.
They just let the weapon are
madam chair okay.
This next.
It would be only a and B. roads
there and support.
Is that right okay all right.
I apologize we just had someone.
Okay because.
Good afternoon madam chair.
My name is Linda guy goes and I
am the affiliate chair for the
assessors affiliate and.
Survey with the other thirty
with all thirty three assessors
of theirs we haven't received a
lot of COVID back on but the
comments that I received is that
while the assessors would be in
support of moving values to
current and correct fair and
equitable
we're concerned about the
logistics and the administrative
nightmares that might be created
in doing this and I see in the
FIR that I was quoted from last
year and and.
We still
more that same.
We're worried that how how will
we be able to implement this in
our office and how would we be
sure that this legislation or
this bill.
Affects just the primary
residence.
Properties verses the second
homes verses apartment used your
time has expired.
Thank you I would like to have
more conversation with the
sponsor.
Thank you.
Okay is that everyone.
Yes.
Okay thank you
You can remove the public
comment I mean the timer it's.
Interfering with the.
Did you.
Yes.
Thank you.
Okay.
See so I'm is there anything
else you'd like to stay
Representative Parker.
Thank you madam chair I really
appreciate that and and I'll
just say that we made some
subtle word changes to this bill
based on feedback that we got
from folks like Randy trainer.
and FY are able mentioned
although it's very well done
seems to have missed those
subtle word changes.
and for example last year we had
owner occupied.
And this year we just have
principal place of residence.
And the big difference there.
Is that if it's a multi family
home like our our let's see what
a four plex that's being rented
out.
If that is the renter's
personal.
It's a place of residence Senate
still remains protected was that
three percent cap if you look at
the actual bill language and
session seats as occupied as a
principal place of residence.
So where this would not work is
like an Airbnb or a second home
that's not a principal place of
residence.
So I just wanna make that clear
and that that there is that the
FIR and I actually got a nice
message from Mrs canning
this majority analysts saying
that she's trying to clear this
up with the other agencies so
I'm grateful for that and and
the other thing I'll mention is
I think what the feedback I got
was really important we just got
the FY are today and there's a
good suggestions more like
making it crystal clear what
this definition is adding a
definition.
And then also I I mention this
you'll control formula and how
it keeps everything essentially
equal.
Well that's if they value it as
a it increasing the value not
just new gross.
And the tax department said you
probably should just make that
clear the statute so that's
another great change I think we
will make but thank you for the
opportunity sure I'm happy to
take questions from the
committee.
Okay.
Are there any questions from the
committee members.
More or.
Okay Representative Pettigrew.
More.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you for the bill
Representative Harper.
I believe you answered partially
one of my questions one of my
first questions I had is I was
fact somebody there's a four
plex.
Red is is as I look at the.
State one one of those units as
their primary residence.
In theory the other three or
rental income and they should
be.
they should be dealt with that
way I understand that at.
What kind of concerns being when
we kind of look I think the
what's things an off balance
where.
Yes so madam chair Senator
thanks for the question and let
me let me try to see it from a
different direction I guess
you're still a little confusion.
Yes we have the latest from last
year that said owner occupied.
You would be exactly right.
that if it was a four plex and
the owner was in one of them but
the other four were not owners.
That would lose the protection.
But because this bill only says
principal place of residence.
It doesn't have to be the owner
principal place of residence
just the principal place of
residence so if the renter if
that is their principal place of
residence the following sections
C. and maintain that protection
for the so this does not affect.
rentals at all it doesn't affect
residential rentals at all.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative for that
response
Are
one of the things that that I
feel like the bill doesn't
really address is the condition
for some someone to say both
parents have had passed away.
The houses will to to.
To the family to a family
member.
They have no intention to keep
that they can't afford to have
two houses I I really think that
this bill should should take an
exception for maybe one tax year
maybe two tax years for somebody
that
Is it in the position to be able
to take care of that in their
intent is to get rid of that
property in maybe separate
everything out to multiple
siblings are however the system
works is that Madam chair
representative does that make
sense.
Yes
chair Senators
yes thank you for for the
question so.
Restated because I'm I'm
processing Mr saying if there
was a principal place of
residence but due to
Family passing away.
It is now been transferred to.
Someone else and their intention
is to sell it.
but because it's no longer a
principal place of residence.
It would be subject to a ten
percent increase and and your
question is could there be like
a delay so that doesn't happen.
I think that's a fair question
off to chew on that.
I think my first my first
thought would be.
In that first year instead of a
three percent increase you have
a ten percent increase you're
looking at a difference of seven
percent.
And when you look at you know
the average property tax so you
know six thousand seven thousand
eight thousand dollars.
When you do the math it's
probably not a very big
increase.
so I'm.
I'm not sure that would be a
huge help to give them a one
year delay but I'm let me check
on that more I think it's a good
question.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative for for
considering that I just get
concerned when when.
So my takes on a debt load that
they.
Didn't expect and they're not
prepared for it doesn't matter
if it's fifty dollars.
Or five thousand dollars it's
still a debt load that that
they're not prepared for so
Been and.
Dealing with that with with the
fact that for whatever reason I
ended up with this property the
last of the lost loved ones.
It's not complies for something
that would that's already tragic
for services and my thought what
we're looking for.
I'm not a fan in anyway.
Ever.
Increasing taxes.
Ever.
I think that there's ways that
we create an economic
development we we we bring
business here we're not not
gonna shouldn't and that scares
me because there's an aspect of
this bill that it is kind of
goes with some of the other
things are going on in this
session in the last session that
you know what I would just every
entrance in the New Mexico put a
sign up saying Hey New Mexico's
closed for business we don't
want you here we're going to
charge you more than anybody
else around us and so that that
concerns me with respect to that
and so I'll be interested I'm
sure your bills probably gonna
move through this committee.
Representative and and I at this
point in time right now I can't
support the bill but I'm
interested to see how it how it
changes as it continues on thank
you.
Madam chair you're on mute I'm
sorry I needed for a minute and
then find yes go ahead
Representative our vice chair
Romero thank you madam chair
thank you Sanchez ran this for
these are Harper for making it
really clear how it works I love
sitting with you on taxed I'm
it'll go there next should get
the votes so I just have some
questions about the technicality
of being able to oversee an
eight just hearing the comments
from the public and thinking
about incentivizing.
The second third fourth
homeowners to be able to use
their homes for housing folks
since we are in a crisis in our
state can you just help me
understand the idea of rigor
regarding the primary residence
or the what it how is it list on
page four it says
The owner occupier principal
place of residence so if I'm a
renter at someone's second home
they will still be subject to
the third the to the three
percent they will not get the
increase of the ten percent is
that correct.
Madam chair and vice chair yes
thank you for that great
question and and I was one of
the when I mentioned that the F.
R. as in good suggestions one of
them was actually included
definition and here I can see
it's and I can see it's
confusing
we want to make it clear that
you don't have to be the owner
to count as a principal place of
residence right that way if but
like you said if if someone has
a and Airbnb and they they see
now this this potential hazard
third their valuation go up
higher they could decide to
convert this to a rental and in
which case that would still be
subject to the three percent
order so I do see your point and
I'm glad you made I hadn't
thought of that or that this
could actually incentivized.
Trying to address our our
housing issue instead of trying
to make you know some some extra
money on that on the side
to answer the second part your
question do ministration.
Madam chair and vice chair I
think that's a great question
and we did reach out to the
assessor affiliates earlier and
and we just did not end up
connecting.
And and I understand that
there's a challenge here in
administration right any time
you do something new you've got
a.
Yes there's a change to the
system.
And there was a recommendation
that maybe we just attach this
to the.
I'm head of household exemption
that would be easy right if
you've got a head of household
exemption used you qualify for
but.
Where that runs a problem is if
you're a renter you're not
paying the property tax and so
you can't be a head of household
so how do you claim that
extension right and then I also
heard that you're actually lots
of people who.
For some reason or other forget
to claim that head of household
and so I'm my my suggestion
would be and I like to work with
you feel it maybe put the
language in this bill I mean we
don't have to it's
administrative thing
but we can when people file
their their property taxes.
And you know they claim
different deductions and things
are they already have to Rachael
so that the show it in that way
with our county assessor that
way.
They had a question that says
principal place of residence.
Or or is it you know not and
that would make it much simpler
to administer.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative Harper
that that helps me and thank you
for the first part in particular
you were looking for how we can
address you know that sort of
high class problem of some of
our most desirable places being
lucrative for home buyers to
create these Airbnb spaces
at in places where you know it's
really tough to to provide a
home already I'm that is our
community without a question you
know very desirable place to
live but too expensive for folks
to live so and so would be
incentive piece for me is if it
is clear which act right now
like you said it is not for that
second third fourth home to be
if it's a long term rental in
the sense of and I and I hope
that there's some arms to wrap
around that long term meeting
you know is that six months a
year two years to incentivize
that long term space for that
and I would estimate it probably
a year and I just you know built
built around.
What what we have available you
know that folks would be able to
keep that tax free market three
percent if they are providing
homes to stable long term rental
homes to other folks I'm so
that's question one and thank
you for clarifying that so I I
hear you saying we need to
tighten up the definition
for a second but when we were
talking about some of the
You know about how to be able to
identify this where.
You know we don't want you know
essentially if it is an income
stream that is coming from that
second home I feel like we need
to wrap our hands around that as
well we're it is lucrative for
folks to be able to invest in in
property and be able but but we
want to incentivize the long
term areas of the second
question I have to and this goes
to and I know that the about the
the same address and we have
this in our backyard here in New
Mexico or in Santa Fe rather
where we have you miss family
home and then maybe two or three
Wellings ought where somebody
may live and then they have
other properties that are
attached you're not attached and
I know that that can get pretty
dicey for hers administration
goes as well where they all
share the same address
but it might be ABCD year or
however that goes so is can you
clarify that this.
Do we have we don't have that
new ones yet in this bill about
having multiple the multi family
in a single location even if it
is residential or if it is also
an Airbnb that might be an
auxiliary dwelling and I know
that we have that as well and
how will they be affected if
they have multiple to dwellings
that are short term rentals on
their same property as well.
Thank you madam chair thank you
madam chair and and vice chair
that's that's another great
question
you know as you start going with
these layers of onions the
there's there's always these
corner cases that that can cause
things to just you know.
You're very challenging.
so in in the bill was drafted
right now you know you know in
section C. we don't make
a distinction as to whether you
know the a particular property
has the same address as another
property you know we it really
only specifies the type of
residential property and and
another reason why we do this is
because that allows us to stick
within the constitutional
framework of how we can tax
property.
That's always a question that
comes up in these committee
hearings is really is is our
constitutional right and so by
sticking within this framework
just addressing the type of
property we stay within within
that framework.
And so so here you know all the
to this issue on that a little
bit more to see if we need to.
if we need to include that
distinction of multiple
properties have the same address
I don't have a good answer for
you right now I I I believe that
covers it but I would really
like to just you on that and
talk with some of the experts
and make sure that that is that
is covered
We know this will be a little
challenging to minister and more
we talk with the people who are
in the trenches and do it every
day and get their input on it
the better this will be so yeah
great question.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative Harper I I'm I
love the intent of the bill and
I so appreciate you getting into
the layers of the onion with
this I'm very pro figuring this
out in particular how to
incentivize folks to
you know be able to accept
housing vouchers etcetera for
folks that are looking for for
stable homes so I I'm going to
you know support this bill in
the hopes that we can get that
clarification you know the more
the merrier for housing right
now as far as in particular long
term and and you know correcting
for that you know the success
that we've been having in short
term rentals but you know and I
know during the pandemic you
know Taos county had a sixty
percent housing vacancy while
still having folks that
you know we couldn't find a
stable home to live and that's
just completely unacceptable
from my perspective and you know
similar but not as bad numbers
in Santa Fe County as well so
you know I'm look forward to
supporting this helping in any
way that I can being that you
know we're all trying to solve
these issues and I really
support you know trying to sell
for that so thank you madam
chair thank you Representative
proper and the queen thank you.
Okay next Representative Lord.
Okay we're gonna try this thank
you that in turn down the
problem is when I'm in the room
madam chair is even with the
headset and another one had
something used to still get
feedback six it's kind of
frustrating psychologist for
that
so my question is ensure us to
Representative Harper if I
understand this correctly if
somebody let's say their great
grandparents said on the house
and just passed on through
generations and they inherited
this house and let's say they
worked financially
Stable enough to reap the
benefits of having a lecture
just have a second home it was a
struggle for them to rent it
out.
That how still goes to a ten
percent rental rate ten percent
tax rate is that correct.
So chair representative lord no
no not a ten percent tax rate.
Increase in the value.
And if you recall when you look
at your property tax bill how.
And I think it's a silly
question but how it works into
your total value.
And you multiply it by a third.
And that is the value that is
taxable.
What you're seeing what the.
The twenty twenty to the mass
you're going from three percent
to a ten percent increase in
value.
So you're looking at a delta of
seven percent more.
Then you take that and multiply
that by a third.
And you know seven multiplied by
a surge my upper level mask you
nodes to point to something
right so you're you're talking
about.
Especially at two point two
percent.
More value that's being tax
that's just off time and I'm I
probably not perfect on that but
that that's that's the real
transition here the scenario you
gave madam chair and
Representative Lord is correct
that I'm the residential
property is not.
Of principal place of residence
that will fall out of that that
three percent but if the
individual decides that they
want to move into this new
house.
That's been our house for
generations and and leave the
house they have right now it was
still maintain that protection
if they want to rent it out.
we all know there's a housing
crisis I don't think they have a
hard time finding someone to
rent it it would still maintain
that protection.
If they wanted to sell it and
keep it vacated vacant
they might be having you know I
might be a challenge if their
property tax comes bills do do
before they if they sold it.
but you know again selling that
house I would hope that they
would
Get a good price good value on
the house and hopefully that
would make up for any.
Possible had to replace the
carpet or do the painting or
right you know property tax to
get the house ready to sell.
Thank you madam chair
Representative Harper yes that
question is.
I was.
So I guess what I'm trying to
say is I actually know some
people that they have inherited
the houses their sentimental
value they don't live in the
same city they don't want to
live in it they're going to keep
it passed on to the next
generation of their children and
I'm wonder is any way to do an
exemption I can't figure out how
to wrap my head around this and
it also would be income based
like maybe if somebody makes a
income of acts we don't take
them to the ten percent cap they
stay at the three percent cap
would that be possible maybe
based on income.
Yeah.
Madam chair and Representative
Lord a great question and and
and I am I'm sorry to give you
a.
Not the answer you would like to
hear our constitution article
eight section one B. makes a
very clear and all info from at
limitations of food I wish of
residential property cannot be
based on the tax payers age or
income
and and a few others in here but
that to directly answer
questions constitution provides.
Okay I thank you that was my
main concern is that you know
people that it land and houses
are very sentimental because
people been here for so long and
you know your grandma cooked in
that house and they want to keep
it but they want to rent it out
until such a time to pass on the
next generation I think that is
my most concerning part about
this but I will go read that
constitutional section eight
tell me to read do we have I
didn't see in every are fires to
have any idea how much this will
potentially raise house rental
prices overall.
Yes I'm sure Representative Lord
the the FIR does talk about that
and I think in a very fair way.
and when you look at again
understanding that this will not
affect rentals right because
those are still principal places
of
Residents so this won't affect
rentals all
But there still is a good
discussion about you know how
much is actually passed on your
taxes are passed on to the
renter versus how much market
forces dictate with the prices
and so the owner maybe gets less
profit.
And I think it's the card is a
nice kind of fair and balanced
way of looking at both of those
I think it's point next.
Of of of both but in this again
this bill.
Commercial properties are taxed
and residential
multi family or or individual
rentals again or not touch the
really the only thing that's yes
in this bill are like Airbnb
sport are second homes.
Thank you madam chair
Representative Harper that's
really the question have it just
that was the biggest thing that
stuck out for me for having
known people that person that
have those homes and they're
just saving for their kids and
summer reading about being bees
and some are just renting them
out to to wait to pass along and
and I hate to have those people
especially given I know their
lower income do you have to have
any kind increase in their taxes
so I'm thank you very
interesting bill thank you madam
chair I rest my I.
Thank you Representative Thomson
thank you madam chair I'm so
Representative Harper.
It is a rental property but for
some reason you're you're doing
maintenance on it over a long
period of time for you can't
rent it.
If your intent to rented good
enough or does it have to be
occupied six point six months
plus one day of the year or do
you spell that out.
So chair of the concentrate
questions kind of harkens back
to the vice chair emeritus
question that we need to really
put a definition and here there
isn't one yet that defines
clearly principal place of
residence and and vice chair of
suggested perhaps a year
why nationally got was six
months plus one day.
We need to we need to make that
clear and.
And I think your question about
maintenance we we I mean we all
know that we we would love to
have our remodels in our
maintenance done in a couple
months but they stretched out
and.
You know materials and all costs
and availability those kinds of
things.
so I'm I'm thinking carefully
you know.
When we're when we're you know
if it's a pleasure is committed
to move this policy forward to
tax you know I'm gonna have
we're going to work with
Representative McQueen on some
amendments.
And perhaps in that definition
you know we include a provision
for properties are undergoing
some maintenance and that might
actually.
solve the issue that
Representative Pettigrew and
lord ranged you know someone is
taking some time to get there
the property that they just
inherited ready
perhaps given the extra time
they need so I great question
thank you thank you and then I'm
I I think it's not in the bill
but some like who determines it
is that that tax payers
I'm honored that the state I
live here I mean I live here
most of the year is there how
are you looking at that.
You madam chair and
representative Thompson great
question one that we wrestle
with all the time in the tax
committee
Because our our our tax code is
really bills on the taxpayers
being honest and then we go and
not meet the but the tax
department the look at returns
and they'll flag things to going
audit.
And and we know that the
majority of people are honest
but there are some people that
to.
You know for one reason or
another like to take advantage.
and so that that is a deficiency
of everyone's tax code here and
and and again even the property
tax right right so there are
many assessors that have a an
army of folks to go out and and
and and do a good job making
sure that you know that the
values really need to be.
But we know it's hard problem
and there and there are some
cases where the assessors those
are the band with maintenance I
push the button everything goes
up by three percent
so it's it's a challenge here is
a great question but
I'm committed to us the
affiliate work with them and see
if we need a language in here or
are they can just implemented
how are they think it's past but
it probably will generally rely
on the tax payer disclosing.
Okay that's all I have madam
chair thank you for your answers
Representative great question
thank you.
Thank you I just have
Kind of a follow at
Representative Harper so the
intent of this it by including
rentals and possibly error being
bees is to make it so that the
taxes are raised
You know really hi and then they
have to pass it on to they're
renters and then that makes
affordable housing not so
affordable is that part of your
intent yes so Madam great
question and again if you look
at the the last FY are the F. I.
R. the the actually copied and
pasted a lot from last time and
they missed.
The subtle change that were if
you don't have to be in order so
this won't apply to interracial
properties all rental properties
right that zero so I'll be I'll
be just fine
what this will impact is like
you said madam chair the Airbnb
ease.
they will see if if they're if
they're new right there already
valued at current correct.
But if they've been owned for a
long time and senator three
percent cap they might be
undervalued by like I don't know
twenty thirty percent and then.
if this bill becomes law over
two or three or four years it
would finally eventually catch
up to its right now
But to read directly answer your
question.
Because of yield control what
this really means is these folks
will be paying a little bit more
tax.
But to keep the tax going to the
county or the school district
the same.
Everyone else's taxes than have
to go down a little bit.
so you will see a slight
decrease in the taxes that.
Principal place of residence of
course rate
because the other homes are are
paying a little bit more.
Okay thank you very much so what
is the will of the committee I
move it to pass madam chair.
And madam chair.
Thank you would you please check
roll call.
Representative more.
Okay that we are.
Background to me.

Thank you I'm you.
Good luck Mr Representative
Harper and so do you have a do

Thank you madam chair thank you
committee members will we'll get
some good work done between now
tax.
Thank you we appreciate that.
Okay next
we go to.
Seventy nine.
Which is
The relating to crime increasing
the statute of limitations.
Secondary and if you see
Are present your might be under
the name of Cynthia fry.
Madam chair
Maestas.
You were trying to get
Representative Ely who.
Should be here.
Apologies chair I do not see
them and it and the last.
Okay.
I just texted he is there.
It could be under Ely.
Madam chair you might ask him to
raise his hand if he's on.
And I'm ready okay Madam.
Okay.
All right while we're trying to
get Representative Ely on if
you'd like to go ahead
Representative Maestas.
Thank you very much madam chair
honorable members this is house
bill seventy nine dealing with
the crime of second degree
murder the intentional killing
of another and has three
sections that have been
cooperating from previous bills
from previous years of on four
occasions of introduced
legislation to increase the
penalty for second degree murder
of and this past this committee
are twice before senator forgive
me Representative redeem on
On several occasions has
introduced legislation to lift
the statute of limitations for
charging someone with the crime
of second degree murder and I
believe that is also past this
particular committee up a couple
of times so there's been
numerous conversations about
this statute we're we're
grateful to that of a governor
for giving executive message to
this very very important and
long overdue piece of
legislation has three sections
madam chair I can walk the
members through it section one
deals with the statute of
limitations the ability to
charge someone with a crime so
you know deadlines are
liberating you you you you we
want the colonel just system to
focus on newer crimes to to to
solve the the immediacy of of
the crimes happening in in our
communities.
The killing of another human
being is different however
that's statute should never run
and that person should never
ever be off the hook so to speak
for that intentional killing so
what it does is it raises the
the statue limitations from six
years which it is now remarkably
to know limitation consistent
with first degree murder let me
back up madam chair what we're
doing is finally after decades
decoupling homicide statutes of
rather murder statutes from the
rest of our criminal code to
have first degree murder second
we murder then you have the rest
of the criminal code which is
first to be felony secondly
felony thirty felony well the
statue limitations for the
felonies attach is to second
degree murder even though it's
significantly more agree just
than the other secondary felony
crimes also we need to fix that
so of first degree murder
is is also the intentional
killing another another that
does not have a statue
limitations we propose to to not
have a statue limitations for
second reamer there either
section two deals with the crime
of attempt because of this
contradiction in law with
regards to the murder statutes
and the rest of our criminal
code.
An attempt to drop to degrees
you know madam chair so if I if
a person attempts the third
degree unsuccessfully that
attempt they're guilty of fourth
degree crime so attempted
secondary murder drops to a
third degree felony under the
criminal code which is only
three years so we want to make
that a special penalty third
degree felony and making it nine
years and then of course the
prime first for a second re
murder itself we want to
increase from the order special
penalty fifteen years to
eighteen years so that it it it
it in addition to being Justin
correct it crooked contradicts
numerous things in the code
right now you can do more time
for a subsequent drug
trafficking charge then you
can't for murdering a human
being right now New Mexico law
you can do more time for a
subsequent armed robbery with no
injuries.
For murdering a human being all
right now under New Mexico law
you can do more prison time or a
kidnapping victim not fit in a
safe place with no physical
injuries or sexual assault
and do more time than a murder
and so what this would do madam
chair is raise the maximum
penalty the maximum.
Maximum possible penalty from
fifteen years to eighteen so
that murder one is the worst
crime you can commit in New
Mexico all murder two is the
second worst crime you can
commit in New Mexico law also
madam chair on page four and we
took this from one of the bill
drops in past years where the
bill director took the liberty
to to aesthetically make make
the this section of law read
much easier so it doesn't change
the law at all despite what some
FIR is are are concerned about
and it takes the sentencing
authority statute thirty one
dash eighteen dash fifteen and
simply makes it.
Ten times easier to read bye bye
listing I'm in two columns
that's all it does.
Thank you very much madam chair
with that I'll turn it over to
transponders have a delay.
Yeah madam chair sorry about
that I could watch everything I
just couldn't get in so I'm here
to talk about gift and estate
tax no I'm just kidding so
hello I did Representative last
is why heard covered well we do
have a secretary but we who's
here with us secretary
department of public safety who
is also with us are they had
called and I know he's an
attendee and I didn't know if
you'd like to say a few words
before returning back to the
committee.
And I'm sorry madam chair I'm
still technically challenged so
on I'm an old guy I'm trying.
After all these years after all
the.
I see
There you are.
How are you ma'am thank you for
here just for minutes also have
on with me W. secretary Ben
Baker you let's say a few words
as well I'll be brief of the
introduction was right on point
as far as with some of the
challenges are but you know the
question it really does affect
question why would we want a
limits.
For just the four family violent
crime for second degree murder
and other states to figure this
out I think we should as well
you know what what I found in my
experience in law enforcement is
that I would say most murder
cases and find themselves in
this category this category of
second degree murder and of it
might be helpful disconnect go
back for just a minute and would
meet we need to be done in order
to prove first degree murder is
that we would have to
demonstrate that it was
premeditated it done in
commission of a crime I'm
interviewing someone with the
prize money and those are things
I was come very difficult and
those are the circumstance that
we often find when we're dealing
with people in.
K. so again to kind of indicate
where this is different is that
most of the time we'll may find
is that although the person
still murder someone intent
surely it did so without
liberation this so without that
premeditation money and and
rather
they would probably on some
properties and so those are the
common cases you find within law
enforcement
it's it's pretty rare find those
premeditated cases saying don't
happen surely not what makes the
bulk of the murders as I see
them in New Mexico so I think
it's very important for us to
keep that in mind it's first K.
love that we're experiencing
my cell number is often
something that we prove through
circumstantial evidence and
reasonable juries what could
could disagree and scary obscene
or to make a determination of
first degree murder in be much
harder for jury to agree on that
point as it would for us to be
able to establish
although it was still done.
Intentionally and without
justification.
It would be more common to find
those people again that
committed the crime in a
situation where it was so sudden
quarrel went on I think this is
key you know kind of the
situation the ring early is that
these really jury sensations
either return for it of first
degree murder we're too quick to
defendant if we are outside of
section.
So it was also very concerned
for us again I haven't had
experience with having open
discussions division for police
department I work for.
A difficult to tell family that
we're just really be on six year
limitation in order for us to do
successfully prosecuting this
and so like I said the lawmakers
another four nine states a
figure this out it's probably
time for us to to get on board
this is well I think it's
something that is that.
Something that we should address
in the further what was one
thing that I want to point out
there this report
C. one second.
It says on page two would be the
last paragraph here it makes
mention of a loss of physical
evidence in the fading memories
can make it difficult to mount
Gemma defenses to allegations
which may arise many years after
alleged that so I want to stress
that for many one of things that
says that stems that sexual
intentions are designed to limit
the ability of the state to
reach back in time in charge
legislation for us let's do.
By the sense of certainty for
all parties and again I think I
would disagree in this
particular case I think as the
introduction I would agree on a
lot of cases we don't want to
reach way back in the past you
try to convict people of color
the families but for for
homicide we should never be
prevented from doing so.
Evidence can come alive many
years later and should be in a
position to be able to hold us
to account log in.
I don't know what it means the
sense of certainty for all
parties in my mind as I read
this for it certainly does not
account for the families that
have lost people people to
murder and so I just think
that's something very important
also.
The first self.
It mentions this is on page page
three it's all the way down to
spot the six paragraph for so it
makes mention that increasing
the penalties for fifteen to
eighteen years that would have
no deterring effect
Well again.
The crime a second groomer
looking it's done without
deliberation done without
premeditation and so I would
expect it to do during the thing
that area in most of the time
people who commit that crime
although intentionally murdering
someone and I'm just I'm just I
do so are doing them without
delivering are doing it without
the premeditated so I would
expect there to be a deterrent
for so I just want to point out
I disagree with up to your point
on page three of the four so
that when turned over to with
your permission madam chair from
the PS that become secretary.
Yes go ahead please.
Thank you very much madam chair
members of the committee it's my
privilege to be here this
afternoon to land my perspective
in support of house bill seventy
nine appreciate the introduction
by Representative my Estes I
appreciate the emphasis on
correcting a likely very
longstanding unnecessary the
poll that significant family
hamstrings the investigative
resources are already stressed
the New Mexico law enforcement
folks and bring closure and
justice to New Mexico victims of
one of the places I wanted to to
the prior attention to that is
often times not contemplated
that could be a potential remedy
place for this legislative fixes
in the area cold case homicide
investigations so for the
benefit of this committee's
deliberations of the New Mexico
state police pulled the data
relative to the case load
carried by the New Mexico state
police currently in all cold
case homicide statewide of
course are not representative of
every cold case being
investigated law enforcement but
it gives us a good understanding
of the statewide impact on
missing presumed homicide
victims not yet discovered that
number is in in over a hundred
and a hundred and thirty five
cases dating back a significant
period of time if only
sufficient evidence was gathered
in keeping in mind that this is
evidence becoming pure forms of
tips confession rewards all
sorts of of of ways that are
very difficult to forecast that
come along fortunate side the
statute of limitations to
prosecute a second degree murder
case would be effectively
limited by our current statutes
limitations your respective of
the fact that the state could
prove that a human being killed
another human being and and I
agree with the introduction and
there the representative from
the sponsor are the the
representation the sponsor that
this is different than some of
the other criminal statutes.
Contemplated New Mexico and so I
reset your attention as we focus
our efforts on missing integer
and murdered persons with the
New Mexico the statute could
have direct impact related to
that topic statewide thank you
for consideration of more have
to stand for questions that may
be of assistance thank you madam
chairman that would turn back to
the committee.
Thank you will go to of a public
comment and we'll take a poll
and when that up those who are
in favor will both that way and
those opposed and display will
see how many people are here
and.
Also let you voice without
always having to do public
comment.
Okay.
We have thirty two in favor and
fifteen in opposition.
So we'll start with the
opposition if you would like to
say a few words
we will have a timer for one
minute or less if you don't need
to save more
and if you are in opposition if
you would please raise your
hand.
The four zero zero I bought.
Can you on mute yourself.
If you have the item number as
your identifier.
Please go ahead.
Chair members of the committee
of the report the other of
hearing so I apologize for the
mistake.
Okay and the next person please.
Listed as justice for Zack.
Hi I'm down to Randal Shorty I
am Zachariah's mom Zachariah
went missing July twenty first
twenty twenty in Farmington was
found July twenty fifth twenty
twenty and then on to New Mexico
you know my problem here is
there is Dixon and not only that
I mean
you know premeditated or not
more murder is murder and these
murderers get away with with you
don't what they do they should
be held accountable a life is
taken our kids are taken you
know and the you don't these
eighteen years for good time
they only serve half of that
that's not fair you know we are
suffering every day for the rest
of our lives because our
children are taken.
Thank you for listening.
Thank you and we're sorry for
your loss.
Next person.
Campos.
And I'd like to remind people
this is an opposition.
Chairman members of the
committee my name is that
composed I'm a policy Madam at
gold futures New Mexico we
respectfully stand in opposition
of HB seventy nine we recognize
the severity of the case is
being addressed and the deep
pain of loss of losing a loved
one.
However we know that comes
penalties than expanding sectors
of limitation and mandatory
minimum sentences do not prevent
violence or crime.
Many of the women leaders we
have worked with over the years
who became caught in the cycle
of incarceration experience
extreme violence before ever
entering the system instead of
enhanced penalties experienced
doctors of limitations a
mandatory minimum sentences we
must invest in long term
solutions to have the root
causes of crime to address the
pain of violence for many New
Mexicans please vote against HB
seventy nine thank you.
Regina Griego.
Yes.
Addition to this bill
I feel it is unfair to women and
potentially
young offenders in particular
that are caught in situations
that have a lot of history to on
I'm disappointed that they
couldn't separate the statute of
limitation from the mandatory
sentence I believe that that
would
be better statute of limitation
because there are raped and
murdered women all the time and
they go missing with probably a
good idea to increase that thank
you limitation but in terms of
it increasing the number of
years I just don't think that's
right and I respectfully ask you
to vote against the thank you.
The only Wilson.
Madam chair members of the
committee my name is generally
will send them at the ACLU of
New Mexico an attorney here and
speaking in opposition to each
be seventy nine long prison
sentences are a principal driver
of mass incarceration in our
state and across the world and
lengthy sentences do not
meaningfully address harm in our
communities increased
punishments are
counterproductive to public
safety this particular sentence
increase we anticipate we'll
have a disparate impact on
serious youthful offenders in
New Mexico in the state we have
a pattern and practice of
overcharging on people with
first degree felony murder in
order to expose them
automatically into adult
sentences and in those
situations young people are
forced to plea to second degree
murder in order to just have the
possibility of a juvenile
sentence we want the committee
to know about that just for
impact we know that people's
first introduction to violence
is never committing it and we
need interventions that reflect
this truth and address the root
causes of violence.
I was elected panelists I can be
in opposition
Okay I'm in all of the people
that will lower their hands and

Those in support.
Okay.
Nicole Chavez.
I thank you madam chair members
of the committee my name is
Nicole Chavis I am a co sponsor
of route New Mexico which serves
approximately a hundred and
sixty seven victims of homicide
I stand in favor of this bill
and I'm very thankful for the
representatives that are
carrying it my son James have a
silver was murdered six years
ago a by three repeat offenders
who are juveniles and I think
that yes it will not prevent
violence but guess what it will
get justice to the families of
violent crime like myself so
until you have to see your son
in a casket or you have to pick
out what they're gonna wear in
their casket or where you're
going to put them for their
final resting area.
Please don't tell us namely that
it's not going to do anything it
will bring justice to the
families of violent crime and
now is the time to address our
penalties that should fit those
crimes thank you.
Chris.
Good afternoon madam chair
members of this committee I'm
Chris Bazan all on the register
lobbyist for the Albuquerque
police officers association.
Mortar is a hideous crime that
shatter lives in a roll our
community madam chair increasing
technologies for mortar are
necessary and we support any
bill that would increase the
time and keep mortars off our
street and behind bars however
we do not believe that this
increase is and off for the
horrific crime off mortar we
would encourage a great increase
in three years but we certainly
think that this is moving into
the right direction and we ask
you madam chair and members of
this committee to please support
this piece of legislation and
vote to pass thank you.
Madam chair members of the
committee my name starts dot.
I plan on running for sheriff
here in Bernalillo county.
Furthermore I have supported
this bill for multiple years
that I've been.
Here in the state capital well
I'm not physically there but.
Have been a proponent of this
bill for many times because as a
prior law enforcement officer
myself I've seen how people work
on the way basically with murder
because of this massive gap in
our law here in New Mexico
I understand also that multiple
other states have dealt with
this issue and I've already have
laws that deal with this
loophole and Furthermore I would
ask that the committee.
Really strenuously push this
forward as we have seen too many
more murders here in Albuquerque
increase on an epic scale and
have gotten away with it due to
second degree and there's once
walking around right.
Thank you and have a good day.
Karaka rail Garcia.
Madam chairman.
Members of the committee thank
you so much for this opportunity
my name is Veronica Roy L.
Garcia unfortunately violence
has hit me personally not just
once but twice my younger
brother was shot and killed in
two thousand three on my mom's
porch the offender was sentenced
to secondary murder and fifteen
years as the Max as a violent
crime in a violent offender he
only had to serve eighty five
percent of his time and is
currently out my daughter six
years later was shot and killed
by a violent repeat offenders
lily Garcia here in Albuquerque
I'm here that offender received
the exact same charges so for
the state murder he's only going
to serve twelve and a half years
as a family as her mother as his
sister there is no justice my
brother and my daughter will
never come back it is unfair
that the individuals are only
doing that time and I would
encourage you to
To pass this thank you.
Jamie for your page.
Madam chair members of the
committee my name is Jamie
Fraser page I'm a retired law
enforcement officer out of
California I strongly support
this bill disparity between
first and second degree murder
statutes of limitations astounds
me I come from a state where
that doesn't exist.
Most of the homicides as was
stated.
Do not meet this standard for
first degree so increasing the
statute of limitations to never
is just and adding three years
to the possible maximum sentence
for second degree does keep
people potentially off the
streets these people many cases
have shown on numerous occasions
that they are violent offenders
who will repeat their crimes the
longer we can keep them under
the supervision of the
department of corrections the
better I strongly support this
bill and asking for do passed.
Thank you.
Earlier.
Good morning madam chair and
committee members my name is in
Jellico merry and my son Devin
here one was shot and killed in
April of twenty twenty one.
I believe that second degree
murder is most commonly charged
and convicted in this state I'm
extremely off base and not in
line with public safety to have
a judge to be able to
potentially sentence a convicted
felon anywhere from zero to
fifteen years although the
person accused of murdering my
son has not begun his child I
need the assurance that all the
bases will be covered and that
he can be sentenced to the most
time allowed raising the
sentencing for second degree
murder is necessary and common
sense and I fully support this
bill thank you for listening to
me.
Thanks rob.
Madam chair and members of the
committee my name is Terry Cole
I am president and CEO for the
greater Albuquerque chamber of
commerce with no other state in
the nation having a statute of
limitation on second degree
murder it only makes sense for
us to do away with bars and
raise the penalty for this
violent act for prosecutors in
particular it can make it very
difficult to charge dependence
properly and bring justice for
victims in cold cases we're
proving first degree murder is a
natural challenge this bill
helps to address that problem
and it will ultimately mean that
more murders are held to account
for the crimes they commit and
our state and that's a good
thing we urge your support and
commend the sponsors
Representative Ely and Maestas
thank you.
Hello are you very Garcia.
Good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee.
My father was murdered in
January of two thousand
eighteen.
He was beaten to death his head
crushed in the murder then
topped off his hands step two
minute container and dumped on
the side of a road rage.
This individual pled guilty to
second degree murder and
sentenced to fifteen years.
I hate to be so graphic but we
need to see you need to hear
what the true nature of these
crimes are and to see that
fifteen years is an insult to
every victim and family of
victims in our state.
Eighteen years we would still
have the lowest sentences in the
country most states don't even
start their minimums at that low
Mexico the state just needs to
show that we value human life
and our current second degree
murder.
Statute does not do that so
please support this bill.
Crystal match.
Crystal match.
Your is that Otero.
And madam chair members of the
committee thank you for allowing
me to join you today to express
my strong support for house bill
seventy nine my name is does
that Otero I believe that these
laws need to be in place the
statue of limitations should be
abolished and all the way around
anyone can hide into the gun the
time runs out and then they will
walk and be free they will never
be held accountable for their
acts dental or not there should
be no time limit on anyone's
life no one is above the law
I've lost I've lost my son how
much this on April twenty second
of twenty twenty and I believe
that we have all of the statue
limitations I may have a better
chance one day holding the
persons in my son's murder
accountable also with knowing
second degree murder is an
unplanned homicide caused by
actions of individuals will no
question have known could lead
to the victim's death which I
believe they both were fully
aware I believe the sentence for
this crime can range up to
fifteen years depending upon the
circumstances and that has a
great job of the way with the
term of any a number of years
you like deemed appropriate in
certain cases so yes we need to
increase the years from fifteen
to eighteen years as which
that's not even enough.
So they all need to be held
accountable and have longer
sentences for the crimes that
they have committed I am close
voice thank you for listening.
Krystal Nash if you resolve your
issue.
Them and mark.
Good afternoon this is Damon
Martinez your policy adviser the
APD the City of Albuquerque an
Albuquerque police department
strongly support this bill in
essence what it does is it
allows the lawn to catch up with
what is going on with technology
as you've already heard from
some of the people have
testified for student support of
this bill already is there is
evidence that's reserves from
the past that with advances in
technology today we can finally
find out what the DNA is
indicating on certain things and
for example with our
with the backlog of rape kits
this is one of the places that
technology is just really come
forward and proven who these.
Who these people in the past
been these predators and so what
you're doing now is your
allowing justice to be become
part of the law and catch up
again with the technology itself
thank you.
Justice records that.
Hello this is Sanji I thank you
for listening today and I'm I'm
I did speak earlier but I am for
I supports and although.
Nobody's in charge for Zacarias
K. you know I am for this and.
I also agree New Mexico does not
value.
You manage the I'm sorry for the
background noise.
But I thank you again for
listening.
Just.
I'm at work I'm sorry
You know I just I I feel for
these families are our children
are like I said before our
children are taken and.
You know we we demand justice
and they deserve just as as well
I thank you again.
Danielle New Mexico created.
My name is Danielle surveys
hello Committee and I would like
to
I'm out by saying that my son
Ryan to beta junior who was
eighteen at what was murdered on
April twenty first twenty twenty
one by five individuals that set
him up to the park and social
media to meet for our.
To rob them and he was Mason he
was shot and killed in the car.
And I think I am for H. B.
seventy nine and I would like
this bill to pass because it is
the hardest thing to ever have
to go through to bear your child
live that life that they're not
here and we do we're the ones
that have the life sentences not
them.
Thank you.
Eric Walker.
He thank you for this thing to
me today my name is Eric Walker
and ISIS strongly supports this
bill want to remind everybody
that no matter how old you are
in this your young child of what
gender you are what race you are
we all know the difference
between right and wrong and
crime is a major problem in our
state homicides daily most of
our gun violence
But violence death my son the
rental Romero was shot on
October thirty first twenty
twenty one now this is a very
active investigation so I don't
know exactly what happened that
night but from what I understand
he was caught at the wrong place
at the wrong time what I do know
is on the rental was a very good
kid and he didn't need he didn't
deserve to lose his life he was
shot four times none of these
kids deserve to lose their life
we need a safer city for our
younger generation on this might
not make crime and violence go
away but it will probably
determine the criminals from
committing these violent crimes
thank you for listening to me.
Okay sure.
Thank thank you madam chair for
allowing me to speak my name is
Li fi Otero.
And I lost my phone to homicide
in February of last year.
To gun violence he was a former
correctional officer and his
life consisted of going to work
and coming home we're very close
family and losing him was
absolutely devastating.
A piece of me died with him and
I'm serving a life sentence
right now.
I am full support of this bill
because I feel the offenders
have more rights than the
victims.
Thank you for listening.
That was the final public
comment madam chair.
Okay thank you and
again we're sorry for your
losses all the people who did
take time to give us their
comments and and support so now
we'll go did you have anything
else to the state of Sanchez.
Thank you just maybe maybe save
us some time Madam chair of
someone mentioned mandatory
sentence it was actually
corrected by one of the speakers
this is a zero to eighteen so
there is no mandatory time and
secondly murder today nor with
this bill so the crime would be
from zero to fifteen this year
to eighteen
And that's the only technical
thing I want to talk about but
just lastly I am sure the.
The help murder is just a crime
that you cannot make right it
will never ever be right and
psychologists have taught us
that I'm setting a family
affects the family for three
generations there's generational
trauma.
From a murdered loved ones and
and everybody who knew that
loved one is a victim of that
murder not just the person who
was killed so I don't mean to be
so robotic when I talk about
these things
but I am not myself madam chair
from of my funds would be
devised by my murder my my do I
had three of her children
murdered and that my cousin had
her son murdered as well so with
that for four of these things
are family so I just want to
thank all the homicide survivors
for testifying today thank you.
Thank you anyone else.
Okay we'll go ahead and go to
questions from the committee.
We already have hands raised
Representative Pettigrew.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you for Center for this bill
madam chair my first question to
the presenters
Years.
Is some version of this bill an
attempted.
Thank you madam chair
representative Pettigrew so the
in the penalty enhancement has
been introduced of it was first
introduced in two thousand
eleven.
And then in thirteen sixteen and
eighteen.
It passed the house in two
thousand eighteen The extent be
a special attention has been
introduced since two thousand
sixteen.
On its passed the house twice.
This this is the the executive
message by the governor combined
the two what was historically
the two bills.
In the house individually.
Thank you Representative for
that answer and.
Madam chair and presenters.
The.
Is this code always been this
way since its inception or has
there been changes to this code
over top.
Thank you madam chair so that I
mean centuries ago you at first
to be murder second degree
murder that's just what they
were called.
And so you know the past century
or so crimes now fit into a it
into a degree.
so we have our.
Criminal code over here in our.
Murder code over here and so
that's why the penalty for a for
attempt in particular and the
special imitations at taxes to a
second we crime.
As opposed to a secondary murder
but it's just you know one of
those quirks in in in New Mexico
a lot it's nobody's fault but no
one's corrected either.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative for that
answer specifically the the the
code is NMSA nineteen seventy
eight and there been any changes
to the statute with with respect
to
you know that the term so that
the the the this bill discusses
you know I
From six years to know
limitation and decoupling from
from the criminal code has there
been variations since nineteen
seventy eight.
Mr Madam chair representative
there has not this particular
research three provisions that
we're proposing today have
remained the same since the last
three compilation in nineteen
seventy eight.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative for that answer
so.
Since two thousand eleven one
aspect of this bill has been
introduced since two thousand
sixteen the other.
What do you think.
With the reasons why we couldn't
get them through before and then
tie that to.
Why now.
Is it important.
what.
To me nothing's really changed
granted we federal work more
crime more deaths in certain
areas of the state.
But this made sense in two
thousand eleven it made sense in
two thousand nineteen and it
still makes sense so they want
why is it on the governor's
call.
Thank you madam chair a reserve
Pettigrew I think it's more
timing now than ever and I can
only give opinion as to why it
wasn't successful through both
chambers in the past well with
matured as a body as a as a
state policy makers with the
rest of crime policy because
when I first got here that's all
there was was penalty increased
it was like thirty or forty
penalty increases and they were
touted as solving the crime
problem.
and and that's not how you solve
crime you know you fully fund
police agencies and you you know
you prioritized violent crime
over non binding crime and you
can you rehabilitate folks to
get out so we're that's what
we're been doing the past five
years this however and and and
and it's correctly stated the
FIR this is not a deterrent all
those other crime goes back in
the day were touted as
deterrents increase the building
I'll stop doing it what we know
that's incorrect as you know we
know that that's not evidence
based policy making this is been
brought forth and and why ask
the committee to pass it now is
because it it's just and correct
it the penalty must fit the
crime and for secondary murder
it simply does not fit the
crime.
You are you when you come when
you commit when you kill
somebody you cross the line you
cross a line that can never be
prospect you can ever make it
right.
You can never up there's no
restitution or or anything that
can make that right others you
know there's no healing that
will never heal hundred percent
so anyway it with regards to the
staff limitations the concern
was that folks that that
witnesses will go away that that
you don't know what you're doing
on that a little bit harder to
defend those allegations what
cold cases aren't I do basis yes
someone doesn't come forward say
I saw the guy thirty years ago
it's it's scientifically based
its DNA driven it's
circumstantial evidence driven
and therefore the the likelihood
of an unjust prosecution.
I think goes away but those are
just some of the concerns that
the opposition had in years
past.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative I do find it
interesting that one of your
statements as we fully fund.
Our police force and and you
know I I very specifically
remember of the last two years
people in this very body sitting
there now we need to do fund our
police forces and so I'm glad
that we were in agreement on
that side and I appreciate your
statement that.
I like the I like the and to I
like what you're trying to do
here and you you will get my
support for but I'm curious.
Well this.
Should passing get and and and
and be chartered.
Look be any retroactive nature
to this.
Madam chair of the group
wonderful question thanks for
the opportunity no no that is
unconstitutional and criminal
law.
So if someone were to commit a
second we homicide on June
thirtieth they would face
fifteen years if they committed
that same on the side on July
first they would face eighteen
years and the statue limitations
would not run for that for that
crime so so it's all perspective
which is.
You know strong strong.
You know fundamental
conservative principles that
that the government cannot go
backwards in time.
They almost act starting July
first assuming it passed.
Thank you Representative thank
you madam chair
A couple more questions.
Representative one of the one of
the statements that you made was
that when you take a live that's
something that you.
You know that's this use up to
somebody stepped over a line and
doing that
you.
Yes if I understand your
testimony correctly
the trauma that that creates on
the family is three generations.
So.
I guess with that is eighteen
years enough how did we come up
with we're.
Valuation come in with the.
The fact we're saying it's gonna
effective family for a hundred
twenty years just you know so
many generations forty years
maybe just starting out of
actually sure about but
Save somewhere between twenty
and forty years us sixty years
the effect city anywhere from
sixty to a hundred and twenty
years of the facts the family of
the murder person.
The person that the lights.
It affects them for eighteen
years depending on the help of
the calculation goes with
respect to to time served maybe
and so.
We we value life eighteen years.
In and why did we value with
their.
Madam chair of the group.
For the victims and and for the
victims it's not enough and it
will never be enough even folks
who have left gas chambers in
much person get executed don't
feel anything.
That heals them you know it's
not enough for a homicide there
is that's why I disagree with
some of the presented there is
no justice in this.
However eighteen years is I
believe correct and reasonable
and just given our entire
criminal code first degree
murder is thirty years people
ask me why why is it only thirty
years old back in the days he go
to prison for thirty years you
don't come out.
your life expectancy and and
health issues and things that
nature so first three homozygous
thirty years that's kind of
uniform across the board
nationwide are stiffest penalty
in the books is eighteen we want
this to be equal to the stiffest
penalty for any other crime so
we think eighteen is reasonable
and that's why we came up with
eighteen but it's it's not
enough for for the families but
I think it's it's a good place
to set the tone for the rest of
the criminal code
you know when we hopefully
revise some of these nonviolent
crimes in future years.
Thank you Representative thank
you madam chair for in my
questions so and that's the I
guess the reason why I ask that
is.
So the same way my.
Eight year old granddaughter.
Her mother was was was killed
and the person was charged with
with second degree murder.
They went to jail.
She's now twenty six when this
person is gets out of jail and
that person moves back into the
community everything that was
there.
All the pain that she
experiences eight years old it's
trying to go through recovery on
for for eighteen years is re
live right that.
That person is back in the
community it yet I just don't
feel like eighteens enough.
And and I'm I'm grateful for
what you're doing.
Thankful for I wish I wish you
to shop for the moon.
And and then and then to go
should it down from there.
And in because this is going to
go through several different
committees
I'm hopeful to see it go from
from here through the house and
over into the Senate side in in
so multiple group we're gonna
look at this and try to
negotiate certain things down
and I really wish you to shop
for way occur and and and then
had.
So you go she ation room that
still made it.
One of the worst things in our
books if not the worst thing you
know first agreed thirty years I
don't think that's the but.
You know I'm one of seventy nine
opinions and and so I K. said
thank you all for for doing this
and and this is probably a
matter of record madam chair
that the Representative Maestas
Representative and
Representative Eli and I all
agree on.
And so I appreciate it very much
I thank you for your efforts
madam chair are you.
Thank you next Representative
Romero.
Thank you madam chair I just
have a few questions mostly on
some of the technicalities
within the bill just subject to
some of the analysis that we
heard and I just I do want to
thank
Folks in the audience for
speaking I know how difficult it
is to speak on harrowing
experiences so thank you for
your courage to speak up today
about this bill I
I'm curious about let's start
with page five of the bill we've
reformatted basically the list.
Of
Counties into I think it was
attempted to be a chart in the
bill.
And unfortunately it doesn't
read like a chart.
I think the just challenging
stature here is that when we got
struck out all of that language
about.
Where we were meant to be
following that in statute now
can you just explain the intent
but I think it desperately needs
to be revised as to what it is
that you're trying to say can
you can someone explain that.
Madam chair of general thank you
very much on on page four.
You know we're dealing with the.
The penalty scheme of our
statutes which as mentioned is
thirty one eighteen thirty one
dash eighteen dash fifteen it
says for first three felony
resulting in death of a child
comma life imprisonment it reads
like a paragraph what the bills
after that in two thousand
eighteen which we put in this
bill was essentially make it a
chart now granted our bill
drafting has to go line by line
by line well when put in the
statute books that we open up it
will read as a chart that the
compilation commission will put
it kind of as a chart.
And all will go over this with a
fine tooth comb
again but it's essentially the
exact same words just put in
chart form not granted the chart
looks kind of fun because
they're underlined and it's in a
bill and there's no separation
but it just reads a lot better
aesthetically for for someone to
open up the the law books.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative I that would be
super helpful I think for
committees to just be able to
look at what you're looking at
in in visioning in statute so we
can line everything up with the
changes so that way it is
consistent with your intent
right now I see things sort of I
don't know if you're looking at
the same thing I'm looking at
but it looks like misaligned in
some of these as to what what
was changed and what was
what was really just reformatted
so I just don't want to cause
any confusion about misalignment
and then interpreting statute
incorrectly when it comes to you
know the interpreting the
punishment that you are hoping
to just recall a a thank.
Thank you if you I don't know if
that includes how that gets
changed in this if if it's just
a formatting issue.
I would just recommend having a
supplement for for committees so
to be clear about that
Okay so now we'll get to some of
the other questions that it just
I need clarity on
Regarding section
Three.
When we look at some of the
ambiguity of the mandatory
minimum sentences
Each section of chapter thirty
essentially.
Indicates the mandatory minimum
I guess but now that now I'm
just going into the same section
when we make sure the right.
Right question I apologize.
Okay let's go to section one.
We're talking about you know
extending the statute of
limitations one of the questions
that was brought to my attention
is about accessories to second
degree murder
so for those that you know we're
participate in these situations
how are we handling essentially
those folks who might have been
surrounding that you know
looking alibis another questions
when putting a case together
after that six year period or
ten years and thirty years
how are we handling those
accessories.
Jurors are vital so let me
express the concern that I can
turn over to Mr Botha
restrictor.
We're experiencing these
investigations but essentially
the concern is.
Some people thirty years on the
role that they don't they can't
build a defense because the time
is elapsed so much but these
investigations.
You know they're unbelievably
thorough investigations they
just can't pinpoint the killer
the killers in the school cases
usually do gentleman by the the
the the discovery of a body the
match of a DNA that puts him at
the scene or or jailhouse
confession so the concern is
what if the DNA matches you at
the scene but you didn't do it.
I think those folks will have
already given statements to the
police and already been ruled
that they didn't do it but what
what did you all any other
thoughts on that Mr boy Mister
Baker and how do we leave it the
concern of innocent folks being
prosecuted.
Because their inability to mount
a defense because it's happens
years years in the future.
I agree with you having to be
very difficult to creating so
many years later appointments
retains of this particular case
I think what we're trying to
focus on we're trying to focus
on.
Again special editions are
concerned these call center
a lot later I think we really
difficult have accessory
kind of hanging case by case I
don't I'm trying to remember my
experience we had a case that we
work back on.
Many years later and we're able
to charge the excess reductase
and
I can't think of I see with the
concern might there I don't
think it would be probable you
have success not only on the
first of March for many years
ago and also to be able to our
success rate also
so I can.
Don't think that would be an
issue.
Representative madam chair was a
rumor of the of.
That concern still exist today
but currently the state can only
charge somebody with first
degree murder so that concern
still exist today for that
person we're simply giving the
the state the opportunity to
charge somebody with secondary
murder simply because it is so
difficult to convict somebody of
first degree murder even even
six months after the fact.
Ten twenty years after the fact
you can you can convict him of
murder but you can reach that
shoes usually high threshold of
malice aforethought and.
And and premeditation so this so
those those.
Murder is essentially who
everyone knows did cannot be
successfully prosecuted because.
The state can only prove second
rumor or not first.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative and secretary but
we and and thank you Mr
secretary but for your service
and I haven't seen you other
than on soon so I appreciate you
being here as well I'm sorry I
didn't get to say hello when I
started
I think you know just thinking
about the state thinking this
through and and and in
particular some of the different
crime bills that we've seen
through these chambers and and
of course
you know in this session this
one makes a clear sense to me as
far as how we're targeting.
Murder in particular and I think
that's very clear from what
we're looking at with statutes
of limitations and my
understanding is that this is
we're the only state that has a
statute of limitations
for second degree murder is that
correct Representative Madam
chair.
Madam chair representative
Romero that is correct.
Thank you for clarifying that
chair representative and that's
concerning to me while we're in
an epidemic of homicide across
our state and and country it is.
Horrifying to think that we yes
I have the resources and and
I've been working for years now
with the missing and murdered
indigenous women and relatives
on many cold case and cases
missing persons
to have the the sort of reality
that you know folks may not be
coming back but the should be
investigated once we are able to
identify people who may have
been victims of of a second
degree murder crime of homicide
and so for me this helps us put
that sort of arms around the
important debate absolutely
harrowing experience that so
many families have been going
through and so
as far as just being able to
tighten up some of these
Realities I think in the statute
as far as you know clarifying
where those changes have been
made and but I I the overall
intent for me makes sense and I
appreciate you know the the
opportunity to to be able to fix
some of these issues that have
lasted for all a long while
and you know want to see this
continue to move forward given
what we are dealing with right
now as a state so thank you
madam chair thank you
representatives for providing
some clarity I still would love
to see that chart at some point
so so sure that
I'm my my hat is wrapped around
what we're gonna be seeing in
statute since it is such an
important
you know clarification for those
who will have to reference this
I and I I'm probably gonna have
more questions in the future as
it continues and perhaps as
changes are made but
we'll continue to work with the
Sanchez thank you madam chair.
Thank you representatives of
lord.
We have to to make this working
with had sent madam chair we
have to turn the volume down in
here for me to speak is to just
get the feedback eventually
would have to figure this out.
I'm so madam chair
Representative Maestas
Representative Eli I just want
to say thank you for bringing
this bill forward.
One of my friend's son was
murdered and you know it affects
friends too because I'm saying
what they're going through and I
can't imagine what it would be
like for them.
To be like one day late you know
on have finding the witness or
the DNA are getting the
confession I can imagine.
Would be like to say that I'm
sorry you missed the time frame
on that so I I do appreciate
that I think this so.
Give everybody with working on
the cold cases more time to get
these cases solved and get some
closure for the families and the
friends of people who have been
killed.
I don't really have anything
other than that just to say
thank you for this bill I'm
gonna and support your bill I
just wish the only thing I would
see if I had my way would be
that anything involves a sexual
offense or child just life in
prison I would be my I think I
would ever after this but thank
you and I hope that this makes
it through this time and I yield
my time thank you.
Representative Thomson did you
have something you want to add
or.
Madam chair I will move it to
pass.
A second.
You'll take roll call.
Representative Lord.
Yes.
Representative Pettigrew.
Yes.
Representative Thomson.
Yes and I'd like to explain my
vote.
Vice chairman.
Yes.
Madam chair for our yes and I'd
like to explain my.
This year the past madam chair.
Thank you representative
Thompson
here
I I don't have issues with the
substance of this bill but I
think it is full of confusion
and and and I'm I I'm calling on
the judiciary which I have no
doubt that they will do to to
really fix this and make it make
it the bill that that people
wanted to be because I think as
it is now we we heard a lot
about the the confusion and
things like that so I'm just
counting on judiciary to make it
a good bill thank you madam
chair.
Thank you and I just like to add
that yes
Tents were consumer protection I
think that it's our duty to help
those in as victims of crime
survivors of of.
Homicide victims of that we
support you changes and things
that will make it better
and help with the deterrence of
of future crimes.
But there are a lot of and
utilities such as you know.
Representative Thomson pointed
out to and and others so I hope
that you will as Sanchez be able
to go and address some of these
issues either before or with
Judiciary which I think is the
next
Committee that you're going to
so with that you have a do pass
that five two zero and thank you
Sanchez.
Yes just a minute I I I serve on
judiciary I want to shore all
the committee members that not I
I think Representative Romero
suggested a real church which I
think would be very helpful and
we will I work with
Representative Maestas said we
will try and clear up any
confusion that was created by
what I think is an excellent
discussion from this committee I
appreciate very much thank you
madam chair thank you members
may.
Thank you we appreciate it.
Okay we'll go on to the next
bill.
Which is house bill eighty one
the fine fee and cost payment
flexibility Representative
Kenya.
Good afternoon madam chair.
Afternoon.
Go ahead and present your bills
yes my two experts have been
promoted as well that is Monica
with fines and fees and Douglas
with the New Mexico sentencing
commission.
Okay we'll give them a minute to
do that if you'd like to go
ahead and introduce your bills
that we can be taking care of
getting them advanced sure thank
you madam chair and committee
house bill eighty one notice
fines and fees reform is a New
Mexico sentencing commission
bill developed over two years
with input from the sentencing
commissions multiple state
agency partners.
Local research New Mexico
research has demonstrated that
fines and fees and the criminal
legal system are expensive and
unreliable source of government
income.
Data shows New Mexico counties
generally spend forty one cents
to collect a single dollar fines
and fees in Bernalillo county
data shows that a dollar and
seventeen cents is collect is
spent to collect every single
dollar which means that
Bernalillo county is losing
money in order to collect these
fines and fees what's key here
is that this bill does not
eliminate fines and fees
completely nor does it create
new responsibilities for the
judiciary those that have the
ability to pay these fines and
fees will be required to
continue doing so those that
don't have the ability to pay
will no longer be required to do
so for me madam chair committee
this bill is about public safety
in the state like New Mexico
where our resources are always
stretched thin it's really
important to me that we are
spending taxpayer dollars to
chase after families that are
living through poverty not
likely navigating trauma and
working to survive every day but
instead if we focus those
investments and resources and
community supports and community
programming as well as public
safety initiatives that all of
our families are relying on I
imagine that we can see much
better returns for these
expenses so madam chair they're
available I'd like to turn first
to Douglas covered cover from
the New Mexico sentencing
commission to speak about their
process to develop this bill.
Chair can you hear me I just got
promoted this very second great.
we can hear you.
Thank you madam chair madam
chair members of the committee
my name is Douglas carver deputy
director of the New Mexico
sentencing commission.
And what I thought I do for the
benefit of the committee is
explained the process resulted
in this bill and just give up
very quick overview of who and
what the sentencing commission
is the sensing Commission as a
state commission has twenty
seven members.
And our mandate our mission is
to bring the best criminal
justice reform ideas to the
legislature the judicial branch
and to the governor's office
this bill came out of our reform
committee which is important to
exercise that mandate
the commission itself has as I
said twenty seven members we
have the a representative in
public defender representatives
Representative from department
public safety in a victims
advocate J. O. C. is on the
commission as our three judges
two district judges and the
magistrate judge we also have a
native a member native American
member of the bar is the member
and members appointed by the
governor and both chambers in
both parties
and I think I forgot to mention
there also corrections is a
member of the commission as well
reform committee is a subset of
the full commission and also
represents a cross section of
the criminal justice system we
have DA's AG PED's victims
advocate some of
A judge and some other members
on the reform committee two
years ago we started looking at
the fines and fees issue in the
state as as a representative
said reports have come out
showing that point in New Mexico
and around this country actually
are basically chasing good money
after bad
they're spending a lot of time
in a lot of money trying to get
money from people who don't have
it we've also been concerned
about the impact that excessive
fee burdens have on people it's
a barrier
to re entry and as a factor for
increased recidivism.
As well so the commission
brought all the players to the
table two years ago we said
we're going to look at fines and
fees reform
including many people who work
part of our commission everyone
was invited we reached out to
all the different agencies that
might get monies from various
fines and fees that are in
statute everyone came to the
table they saw that we were
limiting our discussion to
mostly focus on increasing
conversion rates for people
standardizing processes for
imposing fines and fees around
the state and addressing the
fact the indigent people can't
pay these anyway and having
special provisions for the
indigent and our funds and be
statute with that many of the
people are concerned there is
going to be a large impacted
their budgets drop away from the
process that we've invited them
to stay involved in the
commission came up with this
bill it got almost all the way
through in the last legislative
session it just fell at the
final hurdle as I'd like to say
is waiting on one chamber both
the last session we brought it
back this year the bill had the
full support of the reform
committee it was supported by
the vote by the commission
including our three judge
members and our to sheriff
members one is a member of the
association of counties no one
was appointed by the legislature
and we also have not only a
representative from AODA but the
chair of our reform committee is
a former DA herself and they
were all in full support this
measure that's a little
background on the process and a
little background on the
commission and I'd be happy to
answer any questions as a
committee debates this
legislation thank you ma'am
thank you madam chair.
Thank you madam chair would like
to wrap with money got all from
the fines and fees organization.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee my name
is money calls I am a former
public defender and the New
Mexico state director of the
fines and fees justice center
these are not only of an
unreliable source of government
revenue they perpetuate the
criminalization of poverty and
keep New Mexicans and a never
ending cycle of day in court
involvement because fines and
fees are so costly there impact
can be devastating for people
and their families and this
impact is felt very deeply here
in New Mexico where nearly one
in five residents live at or
below the poverty level and due
to the pandemic fifty one
percent of parents lack secure
employment these figures are
even higher for New Mexicans of
color.
The strongest indicator that
fines and fees are considered
are are considered excessively
burdensome is that a large share
of New Mexicans convert them to
jail rather than pay them
because they simply don't have
the money.
Even even a short stay in
custody Intel separation from
family a loss of employment and
stable housing which in turn
leaves people more vulnerable to
re arrest.
Jailing people because they
can't afford to pay it not only
raises constitutional issues
it's a huge cost the path to to
taxpayers and generates
absolutely no revenue.
Across the district and natural
quartz as well as magistrate
courts from twenty twelve to
twenty sixteen almost eighteen
million in jail credits were
issued so that's essentially
under the current system of all
the fees assessed during this
four year period state agencies
were unable to collect at a
minimum eighteen million in the
funding from Chelsea's hello.
We consistently fail to consider
the costs to people and their
families and state agencies of
the assessment and aggressive
collection practices studies are
shown that everyone loses when
we first point to be revenue
Senators cops the bill
collectors and we were
struggling families to choose
between rent and basic
necessities or to pay a fine
Garcia.
I thank you for your time today
and I urge you all to support
house bill eighty one I'm happy
to stand for questions with my
colleague Mister carver and
Representative a lot of content
thank you.
Thank you.
Anything else Representative

ready.
All right we will go to the
Whole and it will come up and
those who are in the audience to
see state of or to you know give
their opinion those in favor
vote accordingly in those in
opposition.
Okay we have.
Close your read
twenty nine I'm sorry I think
that's yes twenty nine in favor
and I opposed.
Okay we'll do that those who are
in opposition if they would like
to speak please raise your hand.
N. M. CV our state.
Please go ahead.
Yes good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee my name
is Frank Zubia director for the
New Mexico crime victims
reparation commission we
celebrated forty years of
assisting victims of violent
crime with expenses incurred as
a result of their victimization
and state policymakers seek
changes to the justice system to
make it more effective and
efficient and just it's
imperative to consider the
rights in the interest of
victims of crime criminal
justice system reform must
include meaningful protection of
the interests and the rights of
crime victims to avoid harmful
and unintended consequences
reform policies such as this
proposed bill should serve not
only the public safety and the
interests of the accused but
modest serve those who are
personally harmed by crime as
policymakers we urge you to
analyze the impact of the
proposed legislation on crime
victims is this meaningful and
equitable and will this serve
all interested parties will this
approach disrupted funding
stream that supports victims
service providers for
convictions and surcharges that
are collected by the
assessments.
And I'm my last statement if if
so how will the financial
support for those victims
services be maintained by the
state thank you.
Thank you.
Next person.
That was the only R. attend the
repair hundred snappers.
Hey I'm do we have
Mister Franklin from D. O. T..
To speak.
Madam chair committee this is
Franklin Garcia the department
of transportation there's just
available for technical
assistance if anything comes up
we are neutral stance on the
bill.
We have an analysis that
expresses some concern about the
loss of revenue to some of our
important purpose
there are education forcing Fund
and community W. I. fund that is
concerning in the sense with
some rising numbers of crashes
but at this time we're just
standing here for technical
assistance thank you.
Thank you appreciate that okay
we'll go to those who are in
support you'll just if you'll
raise your hand.
Charters.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee can Chavez Cook
with the law offices of the
public defender I don't know
that I can find any additional
or better reasons to support
this legislation then the expert
witnesses are you provided but I
will say that as an agency that
represents primarily or
exclusively indigent defendants
we do see every day AT at the
financial impact that system
involvement can have on our
clients even though they don't
have to pay for our services and
so we do you appreciate the
sponsor bringing this
legislation forward we hope that
you will support it and make
sure that and dependents ability
to pay is taken into account so
that their system involvement
doesn't end up having downstream
consequences simply because they
could not afford to pay their
fees thank you.
Thank you next.
The shopper.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee Rikki Lee Chavez
legislative coordinator for the
New Mexico couple defense

impact of the criminal legal
system on our clients who are in
communities of color and and so
free systems of poverty so we
encourage you to support this
legislation and appreciate your
time.
Salazar.
Good evening chair members of
the committee my name is Derek
cells are number leader with oil
futures four million women
United I'm here in support of HB
eighty one as someone who has
experienced having to worry
about how I'm going to make ends
meet I didn't find and pieces
only adding to the hardship I'm
already facing have personally
been through this struggle of
having to choose between paying
a fine or fee for paying my
bills or even buy groceries to
feed my family I'm a single
mother of three having to worry
if I'm going to be incarcerated
because they can afford to pay
the fines imposed as a struggle
many New Mexicans based H. B.
eighty one would find new
avenues to for me to comply with
fines and fees imposed by the
court I'll still being able to
make ends meet for my family
please vote yes on H. B. eighty
one thank you.
Okay Google.
Chair members of the committee
my name is Lucy to the campus
I'm a policy manager bold
features New Mexico we believe
we are in support of HB eighty
one we believe HB eighty one
will create much needed avenues
to diminish the criminalization
of poor families in New Mexico
many of our New Mexican families
are living paycheck to paycheck
and are having a hard time
making ends meet this is
specially true over two years
into a global pandemic when
people find themselves in the
criminal justice system fines
and fees often assessed can
quickly stack up to hundreds or
even thousands of dollars if we
want people to get to not get
stuck in the cycle of
incarceration they need money
for their lives I miss the
city is that promotes stability
like housing utilities child
care transportation and so much
more our families need different
pathways to fulfill their
responsibilities inside and
outside of the courthouse yes
that you support this
commonsense legislation a vote
yes on H. B. eighty one thank
you.
Family health and are.
You madam chair members of the
committee and we come back with
the drug policy alliance we
stand in strong support of house
bill eighty one and thank the
sponsor for bringing it forward
we support it given all the
other testimony before us we are
particularly I'm concerned about
people living
in low income situations who are
also engage in substance use
disorder treatment as many of
those treatments would be
discontinued if they were to be
reincorporated threatening their
path to recovery and increasing
the chances for a relapse so we
stand again in strong support of
on behalf of New Mexico families
struggling with their economic
security and struggling with
substance use disorder thank
you.
Maria Griego.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee my name
is Maria Griego I'm the director
of economic equity in a
supervising attorney with the
New Mexico Center online poverty
Senator strongly supports HB
eighty one
as you all know our state our
state is a poor state and the
COVID nineteen pandemic has only
exacerbated an already difficult
situation for many New Mexican
families many families are
struggling to pay their rent buy
food and for medical care and
access to other basic
necessities.
yes can quickly add up to
hundreds or thousands of dollars
for many families I'm making it
a significant financial burden
for them and moreover as the
budget at collecting these fines
and fees are just outweighed by
the costs and there are
taxpayers have to pay to keep
someone jailed and so for these
reasons we strongly support this
bill thank you.
Thank you madam chair for the
opportunity to comment my name
is Mona Sir not and I live in
Espanola New Mexico I work in
social services with the law
enforcement diversion program
called meet and I often see
first hand how my clients are
affected by this issue I
recently had a client who is
experiencing homelessness you
could not afford basic
necessities and was eventually
jailed for failure to pay as
part be it was they're given the
opportunity to pay off his debt
and a small payment.
And small payment and was very
happy to be able to do so H. B.
eighty one could have prevented
my client from every being
jailed or charged for fees he
could not afford it would have
allowed him to focus on finding
housing and stability in his
life this is just one of many
stories I believe in this bill I
believe this bill will help New
Mexicans and I hope you vote in
favor of H. B. eighty one thank
you.
Amber peril.
Hello thank you madam chair and
members of the committee for the
opportunity to comment my name
is Earl I am a new resident of
New Mexico in Albuquerque New
Mexico and also deputy director
of our state you just you.
I want the committee to hello I
think H. B. and one percent
really more weighted take on
financial burden off of
unemployment analysts and right
now our court are sending money
chasing after money that is
bear that folks just don't
happen at all moreover I'm
really just certain concerns
about the conditions of jail The
New Mexico they be more direct
than average with the tool hi
the details or anything it's
just really antiquated that
minoring action can help all of
the jail time do you come all
right now
Burden off of folk with limited
financial need and are not part
of money and time after time to
collect money that they're so
all of that there I'm very much
you've been very well thank you
for your patience.
Have yet approachable.
Madam chair members the
committee thank you for giving
me the opportunity to speak in
support of this bill my name's
have yet roll hall and I'm a
research and policy on this
would be Mexico voices for
children one of our areas of
expertise is tax and budget
policy and as it has already
been are you from a purely
fiscal perspective when it comes
to finding peace in our criminal
justice system the Jews simply
isn't worth the squeeze we lose
money trying to collect them but
even though the juice isn't
worth the squeeze from the
government's perspective certain
communities in New Mexico I
definitely feeling the squeeze
the rate of one collected data
in counties throughout New
Mexico correlates with the
poverty rate within each county
this relationship underscores
how fines and fees tend to be a
serious problem for communities
that can least afford them today
Thomas are still visibly hurting
from economic hardship on by
COVID nineteen by the COVID
nineteen pandemic according to
our kids count data book which
we released last week twenty six
percent of New Mexico children
live in poverty thirty eight
percent of New Mexico's health
which would have difficulty
paying for usual household
expenses in the past week.
In conclusion finding peace on
only a precarious irrational
mechanism to fund our government
but they also function as a
burden some progressive tax that
hurts our economy and most
vulnerable families thank you.
Your honor Barbeau Adrienne
Barbeau.
Madam chair members of the
committee thank you so much for
providing I'm this time press
today my name is Adrienne Barboa
and I am that Bernalillo county
commissioner for district three
Bernalillo county I'm I think
you've already seen and heard
about the numbers that the
county spends a dollar seventeen
for every dollar we collect is
it ineffectiveness and
inefficiency I'm of our core put
the burden on our courts our
jail system I'm we can no longer
we could really use a relief
from this very expensive
exhausting process that is not
only I'm not a good use of
taxpayer dollars it's not a good
use of court in jail staff
member that is our frontline
staff that have to do most of
this in between in those courts
and jails I'm it's a hinder on
our courts and our system and
a bird and our law enforcement
chasing money only to spend more
than its actual value I'm really
is that is where we should be
moving we have seen that the
original intent of this being a
deterrent I'm actually doesn't
work so I stand in strong
support of house bill eighty one
I'm as part of the county
commissioner and ask for you to
support this as well thank you.
Parent John.
Davis.
I'm on.
I'm so sorry that was the most
but good morning madam chair
members of the committee my name
is Barron Jones I am would be a
state of New Mexico the ACLU of
New Mexico strongly supports HD
forty one eighty one for the
reasons already stated and we
would like to thank
Representative for that purpose
important bill for we believe
this legislation is the policy
in long overdue our state's
phone lines on provide if we had
a very impact on low income and
I I community communities and as
time we get rid of the our
system of funding important
government programs off the
backs of our most towns
community members and commit to
funding these very crucial in
this is to the general fund I
ask you all to support and build
yes this one of legislation.
Davis.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee I'm
Rebecca Davis and I'm speaking
to you from farming and today
where I'm a second grade teacher
during the day and a grassroots
activist by week and nights
supporting HB eighty one is
important to me because I've
seen firsthand the hardships of
family struggling to pay court
fines and fees from not only my
own past transgressions but from
the students within my class
these seven eight year olds have
no control over the decisions
their primary care providers
make but they do end up
suffering the consequences when
these people are forced to put
fines and fees over food for
their families as others have
said these fines and fees
disproportionately affect low
income New Mexicans as well as
people of color which is no
longer acceptable I support this
bill and hope that it decreases
the number of people
incarcerated and I hope that you
will consider my comments and
yes.
Thank you.
Jason Weaks.
Good afternoon chair members the
committee this is Jason Weaks
I'm a registered lobbyist on
behalf Bernalillo county I want
to echo what commission Barboa
said you know we've been
evaluating this issue for a long
time Bernalillo county
is sort of on the forefront of
trying to look at how we are
come up with some good criminal
justice solutions that are for
data driven and consider all the
relative interests at play in
the criminal justice system
fines and fees on certainly have
a place and I think that's the
past tense I don't think they
really serve the intended
purpose anymore oftentimes
judges way fines and fees anyway
and so really what you end up
doing is spending a lot of
resources try to collect on
fines and fees and I think one
thing that needs to be mentioned
is sometimes when you try to
collect on fines and fees that
the rest of the system suffers
from NBC to the courts to the
county and otherwise and so
really we think that fines and
fees as they currently exist
they antiquated needs to be
changed we really supports don't
think it's a great idea to to
reform from justice
intelligently.
Madam chair that was the final
public comment thank you I'm did
you have any more did you like
to add Representative content.
Thank you madam chair.
Eight
we will go to the committee I
see Representative Pettigrew has
questions.
Yes madam chair thank you but I
do not think I have first
important my hand up if you're
going in order.
I'm.
Representative Townsend will let
me.
Okay I'm sorry I couldn't see it
representative Thompson.
Madam chair I know that's the we
need to flip our our.
Yes yes four four put our hand
up somewhere else so madam chair
this is the great bill but I did
hear Mr studios concerns so can
someone out let's say a fine has
been levied and the county or
the city or whoever is eating it
and spending money.
Does the amount and that's going
to the victim's reparation
decrease due to the cost of
chasing that I mean how does
that work because it is the cost
of the chasing solely on that
the chaser or does some of that
cost get deducted from what goes
into that that victims up Fund.
Madam chair representative
Thompson I think that's a really
important question and what's.
Important to say out loud is
that these fines and fees are
set they don't they don't get
adjusted they don't get switched
out like these are equal across
the board depending on the
jurisdiction in which someone is
being assessed these fines and
fees but I did want to also
offer Madam chair representative
I've certainly heard the
considerations and taken to
heart the questions raised by
the crime victim reparations
Commission because they're
important and madam chair and
representative as a someone
who's appreciated all the ways
you championed
and work to stand alongside
sexual assault survivors as one
I also have questions about the
potential repercussions or
consequences of what this
legislation might be and I it
would have come to find out is
that there's actually no
evidence
that would show us our
demonstrate to us what potential
revenue would be lost because
again what we continue to see
and it's in the FIR today is
that we have data showing what
fees are assessed but we don't
have data showing what fees are
actually collected and what's
true and what we understand is
the overwhelming majority of New
Mexicans today do not have the
ability to pay also I just
considering that question myself
we got to turn in our junior
bill paperwork a couple of days
ago and I was proud to allocate
some dollars specifically to go
to support services for big for
survivors of sexual assault
because I know we all know that
these programs are important and
they deserve more than and
inconsistent unreliable stream
of of funding we as a government
I believe have the obligation to
pay for those services and not
rely on an inconsistent stream
of funding but I will turn to my
experts Juanita to see if I've
missed Representative anything
about what happens when folks in
counties specifically like
Bernalillo are spending so much
money to collect dollars.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee and
Representative I think that was
great all all I would add is
that the key with the bill is
that it doesn't eliminate fees
it just gives judges discretion
to make that determination that
if somebody has an inability to
pay they would have alternatives
so in the situation that you
just described Representative
Thomson what would happen.
If that person did have the
ability to pay they would pay it
so this doesn't this doesn't
mean that the crime victims
reparation fund which is a very
important funding important
function wouldn't necessarily
get that money but there's a
huge amount of dollars that are
never collected because they're
converted into jail credits
which is why I sort of stated in
the in the in the beginning is
that so many people that can't
pay that the end game for that
that they actually go to jail so
are
so we double down we pay for
their jail state we never
collect that money and that
money actually the crime victims
reparation fund right now under
the current system they never
see it so you know just to re
iterate over that four year
period eighteen million dollars
was converted into jail credits
so the people that campaign will
continue to do that and the
people that can't we will now no
longer pay for their jail stays
because they we would have
caught it on the front end so
it's actually a cost savings to
the overall system I'm well not
actually impacting a lot of
these programs program purpose
of funding.
And and I'm sorry I guess I
wasn't clear I I I am I
understand that I was just
curious if the costs to collect
the money whether they whether
the person is able to pay or not
but the cost when the money does
come in are those costs deducted
from what goes to this the RBC
the P. Garcia.
Madam chair representative I
feel like I understood your
question and as far as I
understood it no it's not like
Bernalillo county can state
here's our to have we're going
to pay ourselves first or what
it took to collect us and an
offer remain here okay okay that
that was my question I'm sorry
what we're and and I I am also
proud to say that I put some of
my junior money towards that
domestic violence so so I'm
that's so what we're on the same
page I think that's the only
question I have but this is a
great bill thank you.
Thank you Representative
Pettigrew did you have a
question.
Yes.
Yes madam chair which computers
might add that on.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you.
Presenters for presenting this
bill.
I think more for question
relates to what I think I
understood in the in
introduction.
I did I understand.
Representative to say that the
AOC.
Endorsed this bill.
Madam chair representative what
I actually stated was that this
bill was an agency bill that
came out of the New Mexico
sentencing commission also it's
my understanding that the the
voting members did vote to
center this and send this bill
to the legislature as a
commission bill if I have it
accurately it's my understanding
that the AOC officially of
stains from that boat so did
they they did not vote against
it they did not vote in support
of it but they of course are
part of the sentencing
commission and had an
opportunity to shape this bill
participate in the crafting of
this legislation.
Thank you madam my expert
Douglas carver to fact check me
on that one if needed okay no
that's fine
You know as I read the AOC is
agency analysis that's the
reason why I asked that question
because.
I feel like they she's pretty
brutal against this bill.
As you as you go through this
and and it talks.
Very specifically about there
are concerns that they feel very
strongly that this bill removes
the discretion of the judge.
Home page.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative Pettigrew what
this bill does is required that
the judiciary do an inquiry on
someone's ability to pay so what
that means is that we have to
check it out we have to see that
that does do these folks have
the means the money the income
to actually pay these fines and
fees and if so they would be
required to pay so to it to make
sure and pay these fines and
fees but otherwise what we've
done in this bill is actually
streamline and incorporate the
principles and the court rules
that AOC establish themselves so
what they've already set in
rural that we codified here is
requiring the option of a
payment plan in thirty day
installments as well as set
limits on these payment amounts
at two percent of a person's
monthly net income or ten
dollars whichever is greater so
part of the premise of this bill
is actually to us in statute
rules the AOC established
previously but then beyond that
what's important here is that we
increase the conversion rate for
folks that elect to do community
service or need to do jail time
and connect that back to the to
the local minimum wage so
again it is actually just making
sure that we have some
thoughtfulness and and
pragmatism in figuring out of
people actually have this money
to pay these fines and fees but
then still allow some of this to
remain in the judiciary.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative for the response
so if if the courts the judge is
supposed to make that
determination.
And when we.
If if we get into the personal
lives of certain.
With people some of those
things.
Some of the information.
you actually legally can't ask
for that maybe the courts can
but in that court setting how's
that capped.
Separate in such a way that it
does not become public
information because the fact
that I am at a grocery store in
somebody's using
Some kind of card that that
assist them with with the with
their food bill.
I mean
yes Sir my bag of Business.
And so there's a concern there
and there's a concern the way I
read the death of the.
The HSD analysis from the AOC is
they're concerned about is put
at how do they how do they do
this in such a way that it
remains
Thank you madam chair and
representative I'll answer in
brief and then pass this on to
Monique up it's real that for
New Mexicans every day that are
working to survive and Beyonce
navigating Committee go systems
also accessing services like
those that come out of HSD and
Medicaid and and income support
New Mexicans understand that
when you're looking to have a
different pathway potentially
more supportive and resource
pathway through the systems that
are state government offers that
they're that means we've
establish safe mechanisms to
collect information assess that
information in standardized ways
and then determine whether or
not you're eligible for whatever
program it is that you might be
attempting to navigate so our
state is pretty well established
in those responsibilities across
different sectors of New
Mexico's government and
including within the criminal
legal system in the ways that
folks that are potentially
facing charges
may seek to become eligible for
a public defender but I will
turn it to money got to and
offer any further insight.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative Pettigrew for
fear questions it's also nice to
to meet you even those virtual
we got to chat a little bit
earlier today and I appreciated
that conversation
the way that I understand that
particular concern is one of
privacy the courts so so
individuals already give the
courts lots of information
personal information having to
do with their appropriations
different programs are working
on
financial information as of the
courts are already in a position
where they have to redact that
information if somebody were to
say requests not to mention that
many people you know there's
there's so many rules around
what they can and can't give the
via it brought and
so that wouldn't necessarily be
an issue under this under this
particular bill they're already
equipped to do that and they
have to do it every day.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you for that response.
Yes that and I feel like I need
to go line by line through the
departments
The HSD response because.
I I I feel very strongly that
the least way I read this.
The the people have to deal with
this do not agree with the way
they're being asked to do this.
And and.
This agency analysis like I
said.
Every almost every section of
this bill.
They raise concerns with.
And I would.
I understand.
How the process was explained on
how how how we got to the house
bill eighty one this so I.
In some of the other bills I've
heard Justin this session up to
sixty day session a year ago is
that some of the pick some of
those people that really needed
to be at the table for the meat
of the bill alright there.
Yes they may have been in a
group setting up the at the
sentencing commission meetings
and stuff like that but.
The like made to order and for
the making decisions for.
My employees not telling them
what decisions on six and right
into the rule book forum and
then making.
Yes how they're going to
accomplish this and that
concerns me significantly and
and I feel like the AOC really
really
Pushes towards us and.
If it makes things easier and
better.
For court then that's a good
thing this document from the AOC
mixes makes it make some pretty
strong points so they don't feel
like it makes a better and
reports so that's one set of
concerns and and I hope that the
maybe we can get some of those
people together with you all as
as this bill will continue of
assuming so the other side of
the system is.
The people.
This and and I appreciate so
much the.
Worries that we we just heard.
And.
The real life how this truly
affects people for real I
standpoint.
So.
Yes.
If I do something wrong and I'm
in front of the court.
Substantially different from
from from
Forty years ago when I had no
choice but to do community
service because I didn't have an
income now I have an income and
I can make that that that
decision.
I feel strongly that we need to
get away from some of the fines
and fees.
And and the the actual impact on
the person that breaks the law
it in in our statutes and has
to.
It should have to do something
in the way of public service.
She's.
Let's just get rid of the fees
let's do something for community
service yeah.
Hundred Bucks.
Ten to ten to fifteen hours of
community service.
And and go very fast go there
should there should be an
impact.
It makes people not want to do
it again.
You find me a hundred dollars
probably not for for simple.
So
Mr or whatever.
Next I get.
Thank you provide for for a
hundred to a hundred dollars for
first meeting to.
Five five miles over the speed
limit whatever the fee is I'm
not sure I haven't had a
speeding ticket years.
What.
And so.
Hundred dollars does it.
It would be better for me to be.
Just to do something for my
community.
That has a stronger impact on in
my opinion on the individual
that gets them also engaged in
doing something for the
community and whatever else
whatever ways and took some of
that stuff is well defined here
thank you but
I don't feel personally the
point go out chasing money.
They're they're they're
guidelines there's did given
what they're told to do and so
they go after the money because
that's what they're supposed to
do and in the that would be in
my opinion kind of like.
Well there's a fee here we've
got to go catch we've got to go
collect that day because that's
what we've been told we got to
do just kind of like the guys
for the.
Yeah there's a war for
somebody's
this supposed to turn himself in
for for for jail time.
Do we give a certain amount of
time before the sale equity.
What's wrong just no there's an
effort to has to go with that I
don't know if that argument
really make sense I just I just
feel like.
For the most part.
We have really good judges
after.
The look very specifically if
the person's needs we'll try and
work something out the what's
best for that person is best for
that and I'm not sure this bill
gets just where we need to be
like I said I'm I'm confident.
The well right now I can't
support the bill confident this
will probably gonna continue on
passage
I hope really really hope that.
your office and and the
administrative office of the
courts come together up here
look at their specific details
and and talk in depth about
what their concerns are in the
documents today published thank
you very much for your time
thank you for the bill and I
hope to see those things as we
go forward madam chair I yield
back.
Thank you Representative Lord.
Okay thank you chair
representative
when we get back to me placing
here.
Okay I did have some questions I
wasn't real clear on this are
these fines for misdemeanor
felony or for both.
Thank you madam chair
representative will have money
to answer that.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee and Representative
Lord I'm this includes fines
fees for every end of the
spectrum so from traffic because
New Mexico yield to traffic in a
criminal sense up to a felony
convictions.
Okay thank you I think you are
they're trying to coordinate the
speaker about someone you're
talking and trying to speak on
it so I am going to try to
policies times no matter what I
did is forgetting feedback so my
other question is the case you
just said that would include
felony so this other one that we
just passed to the house I
believe the C. for felony her
sexually assaults a child was
like thirteen thousand dollars.
So instead of them paying that
they would have an option to pay
like ten dollars a month or do
jail time is that correct.
Madam chair representative I'm
not quite familiar with this
question but I'll pass it over
to money Monica.
Madam chair and Representative
Lord
so that your question is four of
it would be a first degree
felony.
So.
What was the first and second
degree felony it was for sexual
assault on children's children
and it was believe I'm trying to
go back and find it was like a
see if thirteen forty whatever
the fee is so they they would
have the.
Opportunity I guess to make
payments on that over time is
that correct.
Depending on their circumstances
yes so already it is
constitutionally required and by
court ruled that judges assess
one's ability to pay we are not
introducing that as a new
concept judges already have to
do that and what it so under
under those facts yes they will
the judge would assess their
ability to pay second degree
felony it's a fine up to ten
thousand dollars first degree
it's a fine of up to fifteen
thousand dollars but there it's
not necessarily mandatory and
then there would be fees
attached so there would be the
whole thing would be considered
legal financial obligation that
could get converted to jail time
community service or a payment
plan
But of course it depends on the
circumstances and judges have
the discretion to engage with
this talk to the person see
what's what's best into the
attorneys also what our bill
does is it actually requests
additional discretion to judges
by allowing them to way
suspended for that now.
Okay I want some clarification
on that madam chair and
representative because I was
told by my experts that the
judge loses our discretion and
that and now there's going to be
a different entity making the
decisions
so at let's go to to let's make
this a two pronged questions
answered so.
If the judge even if they have
the discretion or not.
Who where they going from this
where they going to they are we
doing background checks on them
are are and you know I saw that
there were certain ways like if
they had a certain kind of
budget but how are we hiring
extra staff for this because I
see it on the last page where
there's they connection
persistence General says cents
food stamps what what this is I
mean at the beginning of social
worker have houses now working
out where instead of the judge
just saying because my discussed
will wind out now this somebody
else's this enough to make a
decision so is make who is
collecting this evidence how is
that happening.
Madam chair and members of the
committee and Representative
Lord so that section of of the
bill that you're looking at that
actually that refers to to
traffic scenes doesn't include
fines
and.
The judges are getting
additional discretion we're not
taking it away judges have they
are completely within their
rights they can order terms of
probation all of these things
we're not taking that away now
if the judge the way that so.
I'm a former public defender
when I would stand there with my
client the judge would ask me
what can you are what can your
client afford to pay per month
when looking at a payment plan I
would talk to my client and I
would tell them I would say you
know can you for ten dollars a
month they would say yes I would
tell the judge the district
attorney is standing there as
well and the judges say okay ten
dollars a month Fund some judges
would want to do more but this
is the the way that we practice
it's also reported it's not that
there is additional folks that
are looking at this.
Alternatively what this bill
does also.
Is that public defenders are
already reviewing doing an
extensive review of income and
assets in order to determine
whether or not an individual all
of finance for a public
defender.
So the the promise of this is
why do we then require courts to
duplicate that process when we
already have a state agency that
is actually doing it even more
rigorous look into this
individual's finances this bill
creates a what this bill
proposes is that the court would
then take that if the person was
represented by the public
defender that ability to paying
forty has already occurred.
So the court doesn't need to
spend money on any more services
that they don't need a social
worker none of these things they
don't need people to review
information you know financial
information they would just they
would take the previous ability
to pay from the public defender
and that's what they would use
to apply.
Thank you madam chair hold on
sorry get that time timing down
I'm okay so what you're saying
is according to that there are.
They're going to self report so
no one's gonna be collecting
their information on any of
these offenders done any kind of
background checks so what
happens if let's say we have
somebody they sexually assaulted
child they have a fever I don't
know fourteen thousand dollars
that they have to pay they said
they can't pay.
And let's see they end up
getting those great job of
winning the lottery how do we re
assess and he's going to pay
attention to that to reassess
whether they can make more
payments or is this just
permanent no matter what.
Madam chair and members of the
committee
and Representative Lord so the
essentially.
There it's not just self
reported so if you
Representative by the public
defender they're gonna be
reviewing all that financial
information if there is a judge
that believes that does not
believe that the self reported
income is accurate right E..
Then they could then asked the
the individual to to produce
this evidence similarly the
district attorney can raise
concerns as well so this is
something that can be
continually assessed
also with that particular
hypothetical it's very possible
that that person is going to be
in prison and what will happen
is that their their fees and
bees and refines well then get
converted to jail time so they
will be paying that off while
they're incarcerated.
Okay so thank you madam chair
written up eight points to
another question on this so
right now I'm understanding stem
on page six section for.
It looks like previously a
person was credited with eight
times.
Whatever the hourly minimum
wages so let's say the hourly
minimum wage was fifteen dollars
an hour eight times that I is
that a hundred and twenty an
hour or day.
Thank twenty four comes from
there being twenty four hours in
a day so that you would have
credit for the full period of a
year incarceration so the the
math equation in front of
someone would be twenty four
times the minimum wage that was
at the pool in the situation.
Okay thank you madam chair
trying to do the numbers it
looks like Representative
expecting much from.
Eight hours so that was a
hundred twenty to twenty four
which is now three hundred and
sixty which is a pretty
substantial job and then it's
the ice I thought us on here and
it's also is it and this is I'm
trying to figure out I mean if
you got a finance.
I guess that would play out with
the money there's a fine of what
state fourteen thousand dollars
I thought I saw something in
here where there's like fifteen
days Max jail time that they can
use that is applicable.
Madam chair representative yes
of course they will still serve
the remainder of their sentence
whether they were in a detention
facility are present but that
the right the conversion rate
would hit at that point.
Thank you madam is trying to get
this sequence so thank you chair
representative so fourteen
thousand dollar fine would be
thirty nine hours in jail we
just figure that out right now
So I didn't have another
question
Somebody had brought up that
this is going to affect victims
services is this going to affect
effect victim services I believe
it's on like they were relying
on this money for the victims
services program Madam chair
representative I'm not the state
quickly I'm not sure your math
is right on that it would not be
thirty nine hours for fourteen
thousand dollars.
Okay I'll do the math just a
second I'm just trying to figure
out how the conversion rate goes
back back to that where would we
be madam chair representative
that I think you're you
calculated three sixty would be
per day so if you're figure was
fourteen thousand dollars it
would take however many days of
adding three sixty on top of
three sixty to get to the
fourteen thousand dollars.
Okay.
so madam chair and
representative my last question
is so is this going to affect
well actually some of to last
questions is this going to
affect any victim services.
Madam chair representative I
really appreciate that and as
I've.
Clarified there is a remaining
question here because we
actually don't have evidence
about how these fines and fees
are collected and then turned
into the the budgets of our
state agencies that potentially
need them so if you look at the
F. I. R. it was similar to the
bill introduced in the last
session and again now what it
actually says is the information
provided
the AOC could have meant a loss
of in their own words somewhere
between three million and
fifteen million dollars in my
mind I began to worry about good
governance here because.
Three to fifteen as a pretty
significantly what we only know
is how many fines and help the
dollar amount of fines and fees
that were actually is yes and we
don't have good data on how many
dollars are actually collected
and then put into these programs
that potentially a really get to
New Mexico survivors and victims
survivors of sexual assault
services so I look forward to
more data and information and
certainly to making sure that we
as a government make long term
commitments and investments to
fully funding sustainably
funding consistently funding
programs that are actually
positively impacting New
Mexicans.
Okay thank you madam.
Thank you madam chair
representative that's all the
questions I have a of my time
okay thank you I'd just like to
follow up on that having started
thirty years ago that community
D. W. I. programs and the
seventy five dollar fee to go
into enforcement
Can we ask if
Mister Franklin Garcia is still
here on the call she's available
to be we can't bring him back
yet I'm sorry I'll just mention
that
If people can't afford to pay it
then it and it's not collected
but but what we're even for
crime victims rights preparation
we have to think about the.
Families of the victims not just
the families of the offenders
and a lot of programs rely on
these fines are these and we're
afraid that
The the judges will not impose
it and and and kind of give
relief to everybody so we need
to make sure if we are going to
have the substitution of you
know doing community service and
different things like that that
there is an equal equation that
would get those funds as you
just mentioned Representative
again what
and be sure that there are there
we've been going on for quite
awhile
I just quickly wanted to find
out why is it that we eliminate
that we don't eliminate they are
preserved the probation or
parole fees
And so if they people can't pay
that then they can.
Have an extension of their
probation or their parole so
that I think the idea of this is
to make sure that people aren't
staying in jail or in these
programs longer than they need
to can you explain why and and
as briefly as possible why you
left that in.
I need to the section of the
bill you're referring to.
I not sure I haven't exactly.
Comments that I read.
So maybe that's not correct.
The madam chair I think the
money I can speak to this
section that you're referring
to.
Thank you.
Thank you for that question
madam chair
all state is that you're right
we we would love to address
probation and parole fees but
because this bill was a
collaboration with the center
for permission and all of the
members we are putting forth
this today but in in the future
it may be something that we work
on because you're absolutely
right and I will note that a lot
of the recommendations that are
in this bill actually come from
a paper that was written by the
head of the AOC or if they're
packed and and one of his
recommendations in addition to
all of the recommendations that
he made that we put into this
bill his recommendation is is to
get rid of probation and parole
fees as well as giving judges
the ability to waive suspend
fees and having bolstering
ability ability to pay process
sees for courts so I appreciate
that question madam chair and
who knows maybe that's something
you'll you'll want to work work
with us on in the future.
Well it certainly seems self
serving that the commission
would preserve their
pro you know which of these
at the behest or that you know
lipgloss to crime victims and
also to D. W. I. programs.
and one of the things that I
think we should
see if can be added to you know
make sure that people aren't
staying in jail because of that
I know this was just probation
and parole that people are out
and trying to do you know and.
Reform and go to school or if
you have jobs but also for the
ignition interlock there is an
indigent fund that will Hey for
those who can't afford to have
that prevention measure so I'm
wondering if there's some way
you could add that there was an
indigent fund for this that the
courts could go into an assigned
just like they do for the
interlock and have that make up
for CBRC and or the D. W. Y.
program
but I do understand how
collection of if it's impossible
adds to the cost of the Courts
but they still need to be doing
it for those who can't afford it
and I think that's really
important and I appreciate the
mention of the other
representatives of supporting
these other programs but we need
to do it on of us able and
recurring funding so that we are
sure to be able to get those
supports so thank you.
Did you have any other comments.
In closing I certainly wanted to
appreciate that and take into
consideration I actually was
able to ask my questions myself
about the fund you're
referencing with the interlock
and appreciated that where the
funding comes from different
mechanisms and how we what would
actually be having impact here
but it did also make me consider
how often where in the cycle of
moving the same taxpayer dollars
around with different folks
having the responsibility of
that obligation of that
provision of services I'm so
even in that example Mike how
could we use general fund
dollars to do this but really
it's the same dollars whether we
credit someone or help them pay
that fine in feet or we use that
money in a different capacity so
I definitely think it's it's
worth considering and I just
want to appreciate madam chair
all the engagement you all have
in this committee seventy nine
participants still at six PM so
just for the for those folks
that wait in tonight it really
does mean a lot to hear their
lived experience their expertise
and their commitment to New
Mexico so thank you.
Thank you and what is the will
of the committee mover to pass
madam chair.
Madam chair.
Okay we need to please we have a
C. passed motion on the floor
would you please take roll call.
Representative Nibert.
No.
Representative.
No.
Representative Thomson yes.
I just remember yes I'd like to
expand my vote.
Madam chair for our yes and I'd
like to explain to my dad to.
Representative Romero.
Thank you madam chair will I
really didn't have any technical
questions about this bill I just
want to thank the sponsor and
support for being so thorough I
think prior to this answering
questions that we may have had
so I just want to
should like that I'm hopefully
did most of the homework before
we got here on this bill because
of the due diligence and I just
want to thank the sponsor and
and hope that this move through
the process thank you madam
chair.
Thank you and I would just like
to explain that we should be
able to point to this point we
need to go for extra funding to
LFC or our budget so
We need to make sure that we we
make up for that somehow and I
appreciate the consideration of
the sponsor so thank you you
have a vote of three in favor
and to propose so you have a due
pass for house bill eighty one
thank you.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you madam chair.
Okay
Only white right along we have
two more bills and thanks for
the patience of everyone for
this long evening we're trying
to get built in our committee is
one of the first to get through
as many bills as we can sorry
for the delay.
we're going now to house bill
ninety six and that is the
violence intervention program
act
sponsored by Representative
Chasey chair Chasey I should
say.
And I think we're looking to.
Okay chair Chasey.
We need to bring at.
Yes I do I have the chief
administrative officer of the
City of Albuquerque to read a
nine year.
And is there anyone else yes
Jerry but to check on those
I'm working on this project for
the City of Albuquerque they
should both be in the attendees.
Okay I see someone there is a
Rita.
Okay are are you whether
together right.
We are okay yes there together
in groups we have another
city person.
With them and I will let them
introduce that and.
The folder off the floor.
Three's a crowd when you're
trying to do social distancing
but.
Thank you so much madam chair
thank you vice chair more of
committee members and
Representative Chasey at this is
to read and I airstrip
administrative officer for the
city of Albuquerque I have with
me Jerry but teacher who is the
director of our violence
intervention program and
commander Aaron Jones and who is
within our investigative
Division and oversees the VIP
activities at did you want us to
proceed down Representative let
me just make a few introductory
remarks on once again
introducing of Bill the violence
intervention program it's house
bill ninety six the City of
Albuquerque has actually begun
the pilot program and I'm gonna
let the chief administrative
officer tell you about that but
the the appropriation which if
we passed through this committee
will go the House Appropriations
Committee is for ten million
dollars because the idea is a
very bold and successful one in
other parts of the country so
what we're hopeful is that
other cities or municipalities
or even tribal.
groups can apply for grants
because the money would go to
the department of health it's
really a public health approach
to reducing violence in our
communities and we have a lot.
Wonderful things going on we
have requested ten million and
despite the fact that the LFC
extols the virtues of this
program there's always a right
now a million dollars in house
Bill to where I am on certainly
try to.
To them you know it's it's good
that you recognize what a great
program this is but let's state.
But system funding behind it so.
I.
I I the bill has been introduced
before we have put a lot more
specificity in the bill this
time about how we want very much
for all of the participants who
who will receive the requests to
be providing similar kinds of
data so that we can evaluate our
efforts and without going to let
this NIHR tell you what.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative Chasey I want to
start by really thinking
Representative Chasey for
championing this bill for so
many years and we're hopeful
that that this will be the year
that we get a little further
down the road I just want to
start with the story of a young
man here in Albuquerque who was
shot in the back.
The City of Albuquerque's
violence intervention program
identified him as being at high
risk for committing a violent
crime in retaliation and our
team went out to his house we
quite literally met him where he
was at and he immediately
identified with angel Garcia is
R. B. I. T. social services
manager.
And he enjoyed himself has a has
a miraculous story turning his
life around after incarceration
this young man admitted that he
thought he knew who did it he
knew where to find them and he
plans to retaliate against the
people he believed to chop them
by shooting them.
Because our team was able to
catch him at the right moments
while he was still feeling that
pain and confusion from having
experienced a serious gunshot
injury he was also able to
express the need help and over
the course of the next year
working with this gentleman he
was able to understand some
severe mental health issues he
was able to begin tackling his
substance abuse challenges and
he has not committed a violent
crime since that incident and be
I. P. is intervention this is
the power of the violence
intervention program I'm sure
all the members are familiar
with the metric crime initiative
which American that more Keller
convene to really stop the
finger pointing in the criminal
justice system and come up with
some innovation innovative
solutions to our problems all
across New Mexico and I think we
all see that that does sometimes
those discussions get focused on
one bill or another but I just
want to express that there are
some some amazing built in that
larger package that deserve time
and attention and we're so
grateful for this hearing for
that purpose New Mexico eight in
all all of the above approach to
really address the violence that
we're seeing and close the gaps
in the criminal justice system
and the behavioral health system
and if the legislature is
looking for data driven focused
and proven programs to support
we really believe that the I. T.
is the answer it is an evidence
based approach and we know what
works the premise is very simple
at the B. I. P. team intervenes
at a critical moment in a
person's life when they're
likely to commit a violent crime
and then the I. T. help them
identify across roads and very
clearly paints the picture of
each fork in that road law
enforcement and prosecution
partner state you are on our
radar screen and if you commit a
violent crime you will get
caught.
And then at the same time social
service provider step in to say
there is another road we can
help you get whatever it takes
to get you past this moment
whether its connection to mental
health resources substance abuse
treatment and education or job.
Are a violence intervention
program here in Albuquerque is
based on a national model and
it's had some of the best
results in the country we have a
ninety three percent success
rate that means out of over two
hundred people within we've
interviewed only seven percent
it went on to commit a violent
crime those numbers are amazing
and well above the national
averages we've also expanded to
include a hospital visitation
partnership with UNM hospital
which allows our social service
team to connect to a person at
in that very critical time
before they're released back out
into the world and all the
influences that landed that
person in that hospital bed in
the first place we're also
building a trauma recovery
center in the Gibson health hub
and you're going to see that in
our money requests to centralize
resources for people moving
through trauma in our city and
with expanded funding we could
dramatically expand our
partnerships with community
organizations that support our
work we can get more people more
help more quickly but we are not
here today to just ask for money
for Albuquerque we really
believe that the promise of this
program holds is for the entire
state it's a community based
public health approach and
especially has huge promise for
smaller communities where you
can take an even more targeted
approach it's replicable because
most states across the nation
have at least one community with
the V. I. P. program that means
there are small towns rural
areas and big cities that have
walked this path and are
available to help and that's why
over two thirds of all the
states in our country have
dedicate dedicated funding for
B. I. T. programs in their
communities and that fund is
exactly what H. B. ninety six
would create for us here in New
Mexico again I do have with
maybe I. P. program manager
Jerry but Cheech at any rate you
commander Aaron Jones there are
two of the people who are doing
the real work on the ground
we're happy to share more
stories or stand for questions
or anything that the chair or
Representative Chasey with like
for us thank you.
Madam chair I think you could go
to the public comment at this
point.
Job I think we should do that
we will put up a poll and those
who were in the audience right
now if you could respond to
being in favor or in opposition.
Wow okay we have twenty nine
people in favor and six in
opposition we will go ahead and
ask those who are in who wish to
speak
we have one minute our last for
each person and those in
opposition if you'd like to
speak just raise your hand.
I'm a lady and those.
Can you hear me OK yes.
Wonderful thank you chairwoman
for airing Committee members for
hearing aids be ninety six today
I'm Emily DeAngelis in
Albuquerque I'm a mom of the
middle schooler last year I did
with all of you courageous folks
have done I ran for office
seeking to fill an open seat
city council here running a
local race means speaking to
thousands of neighbors first
hand on their doorsteps as you
well know.
Those conversations put violence
intervention programs at the
very center of my call for
change our neighbors and
residents here in Albuquerque
are acutely aware that we're in
an epidemic of violence it's
contagious and unfortunately as
a state we have been revisiting
the same tactics over and over
residents told me they feel the
stateLee and are deeply
frustrated with the lack of
progress and new ideas.
They shared how violence
threatens our safety her quality
of life in our economic
development our war on crime
approach hasn't solved it and
there are humane effective tools
we've been overlooking too much
as we lament daily shootings
assaults and homicides.
People in Albuquerque on to
address root causes the way
these programs do more relieved
and encouraged to hear that we
have these relief efforts three
of the most effective forms of
the I. P. our state legislature
should be doing everything we
can to expand our best ideas
addressing our most urgent
intractable problems this idea
is working please help us grow
it thank you.
Thank you and I believe we're
taking people in opposition.
First.
There anyone else.
Erik Scott.
Not that I'm opposed to any sort
of madam chair members of the
committee not that I'm opposed
to.
Balance prevention and stuff my
concern is just appropriation
money for programs like this
plan law enforcement
firefighters and others are
struggling to get equipment and
other issues resolved for
themselves for spending another
ten million dollars on something
that I think we need to evaluate
at least the price perhaps can't
we send some of this money to
help training for officers are
better training I would like to
see I don't see how ten million
dollars that the city program is
running doesn't mean that it's
going to work in every other
city I think maybe I should
decide on how to better allow
for these things to be
appropriated for other violence
prevention not just in gun
violence but other crimes and
other issues thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks.
That was the final public
comments in opposition madam
chair okay I'm and next week
like did hear from those who and
are in support.
Please raise your hand.
Campos.
Members of the committee my name
is listed in the Campos I'm up
on durable features New Mexico
we stand in support of HB ninety
six Albuquerque is being
significantly impacted by crime
many legislators and the
governor have put forth top on
crime bills in response we know
that enhancing penalties
restrictions on bail and more
have not proven to reduce crime
our brains and our state we need
a long term and significant
investments like the fund
proposed an H. B. ninety six to
start addressing the real root
causes of violence in our
communities legislation like H.
B. ninety six can help families
disrupt the cycles of domestic
violence and incarceration.
Thank you next.
Rikki Lee Chavez.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee this is Ricky
Chavez legislative coordinator
for the New Mexico from all
defense lawyers association we
want voice support for house
bill six we appreciate the work
of the sponsor and the advocates
so many times we appear before
you madam chair and other
members of this legislature when
we are talking about bills that
need to be reactive to public
safety concerns and increases in
crime we believe that this
measure is proactive and
something that we think there is
data to support is actually a
way that we should invest in our
communities and in advocating
those.
Thank you so much for your time.
Thank you.
Unless Candie Gardner.
Hi sorry I was on mute this is a
list I can guide our thank you
madam chair members of the
committee for the opportunity to
testify in strong support of
house bill ninety six this is an
appropriate build here after the
tragic stories we heard from
families regarding house bill
seventy nine earlier this
afternoon in your committee we
must tackle gun and other
violence with prevention
strategies to lessen the number
of tragedies rather than always
focus on what happens after as I
mentioned here committee the
other day I have a public health
background and served in the
Oregon state as an organ state
representative for nearly a
decade before moving to Santa Fe
last year following the twenty
twelve sandy hook murders and a
mass shooting that same week at
the Clackamas mall in Oregon
where constituent of mine lost
her life I worked for many years
on gun violence prevention
during my research I read many
studies that demonstrate the
effectiveness of gun violence
prevention and mental health
initiatives as I've included in
my written testimony I'm here to
help you lower the violence in
my new home state and this
appropriation is a crucial step
in that direction.
More Chattfield.
good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee my name
is Amir chapel I'm an analyst
with the National Institute for
criminal justice reform a long
time resident of Albuquerque
very proud of the work is
happening in New Mexico I stand
in support of house bill ninety
six I do believe it can be
greatly enhanced particularly by
centering the community in this
process by defining what
disproportionately impacted by
violent crime means promulgating
rules as to how these funds will
be administered reconcile some
of those redundancies with the
G. A. eight million dollar
allocation and loosen the
requirements to allow for
evidence informed as opposed to
evidence based too often we've
had a top down approach and
system partners trying to define
to find solutions that really
should be informed and come up
from the community supplemented
by system resources and I really
am once again I'm really happy
about this bill I thank you for
your time.
Thank you.
More in cost structure.
Hello.
Thank you madam chair for the
opportunity to speak in favor of
HB ninety six I'm Laurie and
constrained check of all the
tier with moms demand action and
physicians serving New Mexicans
for the past twenty eight years.
Rating funding violence
intervention programs across the
state is essential to
interrupting the on going cycle
of gun violence this public
health approach targeting our
hardest hit neighborhoods and
empowering municipalities who
are disproportionately affected
by gun violence will only make
our community safer despite the
ongoing COVID nineteen senator
local VHP groups like the one in
Albuquerque has positively
impacted the lives of victims
and those engaging in violent
crime the most immediate thing
that policy makers like yourself
can do is to ensure these
programs have the financial
resources they need to continue
their life saving work thank
you.
Yes.
They would not.
Is can walk with the national
association of social workers
New Mexico chapter and we stand
in strong support of this
legislation.
We need to fund private programs
like this because this is
exactly where we are going to
come up with evidence based
practice and with these with
these strong results it again
goes and helps us help Cisco and
develop more programs like this
that can be individually
tailored tailored to different
New Mexico communities we thank
the sponsor for bringing this
legislation.
Service Gerald.
Madam chair I'm cert that's
Gerald senior vice president of
the greater Albuquerque chamber
of commerce violent crime and
gang violence in particular is a
serious problem in Albuquerque
and we know the problem is
driven by a relatively small
number of well connected gun
wielding offenders it's group
involved violence and it takes
intelligence to identify the
groups that are active in the
community for more takes a clear
direct message from law
enforcement to offenders that we
know who they are or watching
their every move and for their
sake and the sake of those in
their group the need to put
their guns down or else but also
includes genuine offers support
and assistance to help people
move away from violent
situations this is a focused
deterrence model that's worked
to reduce gun violence in cities
across America if you can work
in other places it can work in
Albuquerque we urge the
committee to support funding for
Albuquerque's VIP program we
need the initiative to become
head with our police department
and we're eager to see broader
partnerships developed to this
program has promised introduce
or support thank you.
Hello we see how.
Thank you madam chairman.
Chairwoman my name is Pamela
east Howell and a volunteer with
moms demand action as well as a
gun violence survivor I've
testified many times of the New
Mexico legislature in support of
gun since bills I know how
important the subject is too
many New Mexicans including the
majority of our representatives
senators and governor Lujan
Grisham's.
The public health crisis and has
hit New Mexico with gun deaths
increasing fifty percent and our
state and homicide by nearly
ninety percent according to the
CDC in twenty twenty one
Albuquerque hit a record high in
homicides and I'm advocating
that our state government
address the root cause of
violence by investing in
violence intervention programs
the I. P. funding will help all
of us New Mexico by supporting a
localized approach investing in
approving programs under
interrupt the cycle of gun
violence in our communities
takes all of us funding from the
legislature is imperative in
this fight we have a right to
feel safe in our communities
that most of us do not with your
support we can grow our violence
intervention program to ensure
that they have the resources
they need to continue their life
saving work and interrupt the
cycle of gun violence in New
Mexico thank you so much.
Catherine a little.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee my name
is Katherine I mean moms demand
action volunteer and a twenty
two year resident of New Mexico
I strongly support this bill and
I urge you to vote yes violence
intervention programs work and
solid funding is sorely needed
thank you so much for your time.
Barbara strategy.
Okay can you hear me.
Yes.
Okay barber chatter G. I'm
retired intrepid immunologist I
worked at the department of
health for ten years and part of
that I sent up a similar.
The grant entry grant program
for the health department and
other state and there's some
considerations I'd like you to
think about for this bill first
of all I think NMDOH needs time
at least six months of the year
to actually set up the program
and for the grants and really
have in place eight it well
prepared programs to the
community secondly data is
really important for us to be
provided but we don't have any
regular connect collection of
nonfatal injury data at the D.
O. H. in some of the other
agencies are also expected to
provide data they need funding
to be able to provide that
support for the grants and
finally both evaluation and long
term evaluation over years after
these programs are finished
needs to also be part of the of
the division so that we really
find out what we're learning in
these programs thank you very
much for your time.
More and the the school.
Hello hi my name's Mandy was
called a high number madam chair
members of the committee my name
is Brenda school in New Mexico
president of New Mexicans to
prevent gun violence we stand in
strong support of HB ninety six
and thank Representative Chasey
for continuing every year to try
to get this past violence
intervention programs are
important way to stop gun
violence help those on a path of
doing something unfortunate with
the gun to have an honorable
exit and get to the services
they need to be a stable job
drug rehab except for the lower
citizen right of the V. I. P.
program in Albuquerque is a
great example as to how these
programs work to prevent gun
violence but we need them all
over the state including Santa
Fe which is seeing a trend of
use going down the path of
violence and drugs we cannot
incarcerate car straight away
out of this problem we need to
help potential violence
offenders to choose a different
path which is exactly what the
program in Albuquerque is doing
thank you very much.
Barron Jones.
You madam chair and members of
the committee on my name is
parents all ACLU New Mexico the
ACLU of New Mexico support this
powerful piece of legislation
and thank the Representative
Kate thank Representative Chasey
for this legislation in and and
that will the types of
corrective legislation we need
Assen Mexico if we want to
improve public safety out on
there's a growing body of leases
so these have program staff sat
and that the communities most
common ground I as an individual
witnesses brother murdered as a
result of violence anchored you
all he joined approximate thirty
nine other states and support
this common sense at work thank
you much for allowing me to
speak.
That was the final public
comment madam chair.
Thank you I'm
AT Care Chasey would you like
to.
Thanks and works I wanted to
make it just a couple of
comments really quickly I I
would I think the gentleman who
suggested that we could make it
evidence based rather than
have specific evidence informed
rather than evidence based I
will discuss that with the city
because that may be
it is advisable given the fact
that we're going to have so many
we hope applications from
various kinds of communities and
they may not already have
reserves like the City of
Albuquerque does have data on
how it's working so that might
be a good suggestion I just want
to point out that the
The bill contemplates an
administrative aide for the
department of health with a
million dollars that would be
thirty thousand it's limited to
three percent of the
appropriation.
The evaluation is extremely
important for the success for
the continuing improvement of
the programs so that is why we
have that money in there.
Because we value the
The learning about the success
that's why The New Mexico's
sentencing commission is
involved however the one thing
we don't provide for in this
legislation but we need to be
looking at that as the
sentencing commission may need a
little more support than they
have to help us with that
alternative valuation so I just
want to let the committee know
we we heard those comments.
Thank you madam chair will go to
the committee and are there any
questions.
I'm sorry Representative Romero
thank you madam chair my I
mostly have more comments I
think that anything and possibly
one question I was this on the
governor's call for the session
I'm just curious yes.
Because it is an appropriations
bill might thanks that we could
have just introduce the bill
without a message but it's a
brand new program for the state
the city has been doing the
pilot but yes we have a message
thank you for saying that madam
chair this for me and and as
comprehensive as it is and thank
you for having the ability to
demonstrate I think with the
City of Albuquerque the
potential but it has this is you
know one of the only
prop crime prevention bills that
we've seen this session so far
in this committee I hope they're
more I really am just grateful
to hear how comprehensive it
truly is and I hope that it gets
fully funded I wish I Madam
appreciations for exactly that
reason but that said I just so
appreciate the due diligence the
stories and of course the data
which helps us you know really
make and fine tune programs that
the necessity of various
communities one of my interests
and I know it's not necessarily
exactly in this bill is is
looking at better training for
programs such as this that we'll
get first response and and
policing as well and working
with the public safety
department so continue that
discussion with you since this
is top of mind on on how to
prevent this but I love this
program the presented today and
I'm glad to support it thank you
madam chair just some comments.
Thank you Representative
Pettigrew.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you chair Chasey for.
Legislation I think most of my
services for clarification and
destroying ram around things
I'm.
Madam chair and chair Chasey.
One of the comments the one my
notes is that fifty percent of
the grant goes to community
based service providers and so
with yes that's correct.
Do any of those community based
service providers already
receive state or federal funds.
Madam chair Representative
Pettigrew the purpose of putting
that into the requirements is
that.
It's not that they are going to.
We get the money it's to show
that there's a system of support
where there behavioral health
services in the community.
They would be able to
The department of health wants
to know that they're going to be
able to provide needed services
or the individuals involved in
the program it's not a direct
let's just say
What's the.
Espanola is getting a branch
we're not going to sub lease
and.
Have the money to people in
Espanola unless they are
providers in Espanola and less
they are involved in this
program.
And I appreciate that response
thank you for that but I'm
curious.
To ask a question maybe a little
bit differently.
Those organizations that woods
the this do they already
received some level of state and
federal funds.
Well you're asking and no they
might very well I know that when
I my clients my clients in the
legal system and go in state
county or Santa Fe County very
often had court ordered services
in which they need to
participate.
Those people did get for example
if they will have to go to
domestic violence program.
Very often the state would pay
for the services that the client
would receive their but right
now
we we can say that we don't know
what communities will apply and
what communities providers are
available there thank you very
much for that and so what what I
think I just heard you say is
maybe.
Potentially or possibly but you
don't go into the until the
grant to the the grant writers
Turnitin in their proved so.
Perhaps this manner could tell
you how in Albuquerque perhaps
hosting service is receding
state or city or grant dollars
and it is included if you if you
would like an example because we
do have actual evidence in
Albuquerque.
Representative no I think we're
trying to go with this is.
You know one
I don't
and I don't like things that
allow organizations that already
receive a certain amount of
state or federal funds to be
able to double defer to to to do
you know just to keep.
Living off of the legislative so
and and appropriations side so
that's the all of this it's
always where you're headed I see
what you have let me let me tell
you.
So let's say they are already
providing the certain amount of
services that are funded by CYFD
for family reunification.
Get this an opportunity to
participate in this grant
they're doing something entirely
different with it entirely
different population so they
they're actually taking on more
work it's not double dipping and
all.
Get paid for what they're doing
for CYFD okay and I appreciate
that answer including chairman
next question would be.
In this gets into the
theoretical ram one of the other
things that concerns me is is.
The potential that because we do
have members and and both the
house and the Senate the run
different organizations that
receive funding I'm concerned
that this piece of legislation
could actually go to an
organization that has.
The state legislator on their
payroll.
In is there anything that we
the.
In this bill that keeps that
from happening.
The government will conduct act
would keep that from happening
without disclosure.
Okay.
All right thank you for that
response and.
As I read this.
It shows that at least twenty
percent of the funds must be
awarded to communities with
populations greater than five
hundred forty thousand so I feel
like this is written well it is
written specifically for
Albuquerque.
Because the ceiling community we
have in the state of New Mexico
the.
Is over that what what actually
this actually limiting how much
can go to Albuquerque if you
look at from that way too no
more and no more than twenty
percent could go to that great
that sounds.
State.
Representative I know trying to
get back in review that because
I wrote it as at least twenty
percent so if if and and and I
can.
Would not be the first time
today chair that I've I've been
wrong
So.
You go back and find that later
but that's good I I appreciate
you explaining that part to me
at limits that it does it
minimize it so
that's great so.
Then we talk about a a one time
appropriation on a bill that.
That.
Has an expectation to go at
least the next five years how do
you have chair madam chair and
chair Chasey how do you how do I
do you intend to move forward
from twenty twenty three
forward.
Let me go to turn it over to
this we're instructed clarify
because I answered wrong in the
last question okay.
Thank you madam chair
Representative Pettigrew my
understanding of this is that
the bill aims to set up a funds
that with David presumably be
created as a special revenue
fund within the state government
budget within the department of
health and that could be
designated as non returning so
that that money could be spent
over the course of the bills
life.
Thank you very much for that
response.
Okay I Madam chair of the church
issue I appreciate your time I
think that's all the questions I
have.
I actually left the state at
least twenty percent so I'm
going to ask Miss Neier to
explain that as well let me let
me just say that.
It is possible that it'll take a
while to gear up with this and
maybe that's why we use that
terminology okay.
Thank you very much thank you
madam chair.
Thank you.
You want on briefly
Sorry.
Thank you madam chair be happy
to so I'm yes I'm looking just
so everybody's on the same page
I am looking at a page for the
version of the bill that I have
been in that section I
subsection B. two and it does
say at least twenty percent of
the total annual amount
appropriated shall be awarded to
counties or municipalities and
so you know I I think that is
just what it is at but I do
believe that the work being done
in Albuquerque is going to
benefit the entire state because
we are really leading the way
giving that data information so
we can have a data informed
program going forward and would
certainly would love the
opportunity to use any funds
designated for that metro area
to help replicate the program in
other parts of the state thank
you thank you Representative
Lord.
Okay just give the thank you
madam chair and thank you
Representative again we have to
coordinate with this whole thing
I'm.
So I do have a question on this
Madam chair representative on
page two I was looking at
violent crime so violent crime
per the FBI is murder and then I
go down here and section three
line eighteen page two and I see
as homicides and violent crimes.
And then right there's no
mention right.
Robbery there's no mention of
robbery there is aggravated
assault and then there's the use
the word shooting can you
explain to me why I'm grateful
is not
Houston here for violent crimes.
I will defer to the city on
that.
Representative Chasey madam
chair at the end of the intent
was just to say including you
know it was that just selecting
some of the I. crime categories
that have been up across the
state over the years that this
bill has been circulating but
certainly there's no intent to
exclude any category of violent
crime including rape thank you.
Thank you madam chair and
representative yeah I was I was
just concerned over this because
I think I was like because we
just had a bill earlier this
week where we look at the
definitions from the Afghan it's
murder and rape robbery and
aggravated assault and I didn't
see right in there and I didn't
see any mention of right.
moving forward which was very
troublesome for me
Okay so.
Can you define activated assault
for me please.
It.
Sure.
In our statute and I'd like to
look at rather than.
It's not it doesn't need to be
defined in this bill
Maybe they are.
The police officer who's there
the city could tell us how
that's defined in statute.
Madam chair and.
Representative Lord thank you
for that question so I I think
it would probably be best to
refer to that the definition in
statute but I can explain it I
returned to San is is an assault
which is is where you threaten
to harm someone obviously
battery is different because you
actually you actually harmed the
victim in that case the order
would be an example of that
would be pointing a a firearm at
someone or threatening someone
with a deadly weapon which could
be an edge weapon but
You know we've seen a lot
unfortunately in our city is
accurate to solve a lot of times
has to do with gun violence and
so that they pointing a weapon
at someone or shooting at
someone or it doesn't strike
than those would all be
instances that would fall under
the category of aggravated
assault.
Thank you for that answer and
thank you madam chair
representative so if I'm
understanding correctly the
battery's actual harming of
someone and then the aggravated
assault could be someone comes
up to the north and or gun or
weapon says if you give me all
your money is that correct.
Madam chair and Representative
Lord you are correct that.
Okay.
So this is going to lead into my
next question so when I look
Karen page three.
All the sudden we go from this
which is fine we're talking
about violent crime and we have
a horrific problem and I'm very
well.
Chairman but my district is
Birla County I'm now into
down into parts of Albuquerque
and from living here watching
the news and having friends that
are law enforcement I'm very
well aware of the violent crime
issue as well as crimes are
committed with a gun so.
I feel like all this and we
start with this definition and
then we go off the rails when we
go to the next page because now
we go to.
Reducing gun violence and I know
that gun violence is a part of
violent crime need to be
murdered raped robbed assaulted
with somebody is a gun but that
could also be murder
by a claw hammer rape with a
knife robbery with a knife there
could be various different ways
so why did we suddenly go from
talking about violent crime to
suddenly just pinpointing.
And I and I'm gonna disagree
with this terminology gun
violence I don't believe that I
have concerts mileage at all I
think it's.
Violent crime with various
weapons a gun and I for Clarke
so while the state did we jumped
to the term gun violence and
that and then that goes all the
way through this now we're
talking about gun violence and
again I'm gonna say there is a
lot of violence of crimes but
why specifically use that
wording because now we go from
violent crime to gun violence
and aggravated assault.
Because of the murders that were
committed in twenty eleven only
fifty percent of them involved
guns and now we're up to eighty
percent so.
We are targeting gun violence
and that's what we're doing.
Okay Madam chair representative
but isn't isn't.
We have a lot of murders and by
the way the numbers are
incorrect that we have for
Albuquerque because are not
including Berlin county
sheriff's all the time and are
not including state police
murders those numbers that we
have are actually way lower than
what we actually have so isn't
any murder important or is it
just murdered by guns.
Important but this is the focus
of this bill.
Okay which is where I have my
problem so chair representative
I am the violence I'm survivor
of.
A violent crime with a knife.
I get very frustrated when there
seems to be minimizing that
because all of a sudden it's
just gun violence which again I
disagree with that terminology
because my guns are not violent
my issue is we have a violence
problem in Albuquerque which is
over that I mean I was a guest
on the stats we're like number
three or four on the list for
violent cities and I don't think
it's really fair with the
terminology to just look at
something that's with one
specific weapon and we're not
looking at anything with a knife
or gun or car.
Or anything else the
strangulation because to me.
A violent crime as a murder rape
robbery and aggravated assault
and doesn't matter how it
happens what matters is that it
happens and then it's a violent
crime and I don't think we
should minimize by someone
throwing in the word gun.
I think we should be looking at
all violence all the crime that
is happening it should be all
encompassing because once you
get to page two you lose me.
I'm here Mike okay yeah go of
crime a crime it's embarrassing
how her crime rate is.
I mean every time I look at the
stats I'm like my god we have a
tremendous amount of crime and I
don't care if it comes from a
knife and I don't care for guns
the gun the overall study on
this.
Should be back to.
Murder rape robbery aggravated
assault.
Just like that last bill that we
had a bill earlier today that
was to increase current
technologies.
And it didn't specifically say.
With guns it said.
Just violent crime and murders
and assault to children which is
superintendent all these things
all tied together.
So if I'm reading this
correctly.
It looks like the focus went
from the very beginning.
Of when you look at page one.
And related to crime and act of
violence intervention program
created to violence and
intervention program funds to
this really is something looking
at just specifically with guns
and I and I cannot agree with
that because yes that's one of
the problems but there are many
more problems besides just those
and I would never want to
minimize what's happened to
other people.
So I I have a question on so the
appropriation.
I can hear people talking.
So I can hear so on we have
appropriations of ten million
dollars.
And that is recurring I'm and
we're getting that from a grant
can you tell me where grant
money comes from.
Fund Madam chair of the lord can
you teacher questions pertinent
to the bill.
I am I'm I'm talking about on
here on page six I would like to
know about the ten million
dollars that is going to be
recurring so it comes to the
general fund word is general
Madam chair representative we're
just
General fund money come from.
Representative Lord
that's not part of the bill
where the funding LFC or general
fund whatever let's keep it to
the bill please.
Well it comes from tax dollars
so I just want to know where my
tax dollars are going and again
I'm gonna go back to this bill
that started off fine which said
it was going to look at
homicides and aggravated
assaults and violent crime which
is murder rape and robbery and
then it turned into.
Just buy guns.
And I can't agree with this bill
at all because you're completely
disenfranchise ing any body who
has been raped or murdered or
robbed by anything other than a
gun and it's very disappointing
so I will definitely not be
supporting this bill and less
the wording gets changed on that
I can't think anything other the
state other than it started as
something and and that the
something else so I yield my
time that's all the questions I
have thank you thank you
Representative.
Okay seeing no more questions
what is the will of the
committee moved it to pass madam
chair second that madam chair.
Thank you we have a motion by
Representative Thomson Purdue
passing a second by
Representative Romero would you
please take roll call.
Representative Lord no.
Representative Pettigrew no.
Representative Thomson yes.
Vice chair Romero.
Yes.
Madam chair for our yes.
Three two two passed.
Thank you
at chair Chasey you have a do
pass and be to and good luck
with your thank you thank you
madam chair in this committee

Okay Representative meeting
Madam you're always a chair.
I think thank you okay we will
now go to on our final bill
thank you everyone for standing
in there
this is house bill nine the
unlawful access to fire arms by
a minor and of the sponsors are
Representative urging and
Senator Ivey Soto do we have
them
That we can elevate them to the
panel please.
This.
Representative turned in.
She still.
You madam chair this is Senator
Ivy Soto and Representative
should be here just a moment.
Thank you where are I'm sending
her a new thank just a minute.
Madam chair ready.
Thank you we were just trying to
send you Representative turned
in a new link so.
Your glad to have you there.
Would you like to go ahead and
introduce your bill.
Madam chair thank you very much.
Your.
Your responsibility.
That's.
Follow House Bill.
Representative.
And I am one of the calls but I
am one of the sponsors
House Bill.
Tonight I'm here with the
another one of the sponsors
senator Daniel Ivey Soto.
In New Mexico we went.
Among all the states.
All children who have been
killed.
Background
what we've done is we have
passed house bill we are
presenting house bill nine.
To make sure that we are keeping
children safe.
And it's important to make sure
that when our children go to
school where ever they are we
know that they're going to come
home at night House Bill line
creates a penalty if child has
access to a gun and is able to
grant Mr not cause bodily harm
or death there's a penalty that
is being proposed under house
bill nine that will create a
thousand dollar penalty I am a
misdemeanor however it is used
to because that our bodily
injury.
The penalty will be about forty
three dollars.
So what we're looking to do is
to make sure that our children
are safe remember the mantra is
you're done your responsibility.
Is
there anything else you'd like
that thank you very much
Representative hundred and well
discussion is not about the
right to own a gun.
And this is not about the right
of a parent to decide.
That their children should have
access to that actually this
about that.
When the repair to size of the
drops of access to dental
problems.
The job gets access to a gun
without a parent guardian.
That is that as well and the
child uses a gun with with
operations
In the commission of a crime.
The person responsible for
storing keeping back up.
Gun ownership is a right with
the right comes responsibility.
This this bill does nothing to
inhibit the right.
What this bill does.
Is it focuses on the
responsibility of.
Thank.
Thank you do you have any
experts that you would like to
introduce.
We do not.
Okay yes sorry for the lateness
we just wanted to get your bill
heard for you we will go to the
public and we have a poll first
so if you'll bring data.
Hey and all those in favor or
opposed please indicate.
Okay I'm those in favor I have
to get closer and so are twenty
three and those opposed
fourteen.
So I'm.
What I'm going to do is
asked that we she the responses
to one minute those who are want
to go ahead and make public
comment your the vote has
already for opposition or in
favor and has been acknowledged
but if you'd like to speak we're
going to keep it to one minute
and I'm going to which probably
isn't going to be a problem a
key to it thirty minutes on both
sides
so let's start with those in
opposition if you'll raise your
hand.
I apologize I eight I had raised
my hand earlier when
Representative Lord was speaking
I apologize I am absolutely in
favor of the this house bill
nine.
Okay thank you.
All right the next person in
opposition please.
You are listed as Chavez.
Yes thank you and good evening I
would like to speak in
opposition of this bill.
I stink it lacks clarity and
section one B. of the bill as as
as proposed when it states that
Provided that with regard to
residents the person had no
reasonable suspicion based on
objective facts and
circumstances that a child was
likely to be present where
fireman's kept or stored how
does affect people who do not
have children in their home but
may have guests come visit that
do have children a thousand
dollar fine I feel is rather
steep I admit purple responsible
gun owner I keep my secured in
locked up and as a separate
compartment of my house in this
bill there is a definition of
securely stored but no mention
of any requirements within the
bill and Daniel Ivey Soto
Representative Soto said that
this doesn't inhibit the right
yet this bill Carey's penalty
felony penalties for the actions
of others that was stripped away
one person second amendment
rights for life.
Thank you for hearing me this
evening and.
Thank you.
Yes.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee anyone who owns a
firearm children home obviously
has a responsibility to keep
their children safe from the
state may have reasonably
arguable interest in helping
families to sell I don't however
the curative measures into a
public outreach for the
appropriate tool for the state
to exercise interest in this
matter.
We just heard a large amount of
testimony about house bill
eighty one regarding active
provide on communities
throughout New Mexico how many
many New Mexicans are unable to
pay these funds and therefore
end up in jail how much money
the state spends chasing and
jailing people who are unable to
pay we heard a fine
disproportionately affect the
poor and minority communities if
I'm wealthy I can to frame I
find completely under house bill
nine by pointing to my expenses
gun safe indigent I can to spray
maybe five dollars but when you
do a cable lock why would house
bill ninety different rows the
creation clinical crime should
we assume then the same people
spoke in support of house bill
anyone oppose this bill.
Amounts unlikely to be widely
used extremely alive
Representative fact for these
reasons I strongly encourage the
committee to oppose house bill
nine.
Tera mai got.
Thank you madam chair term it
should New Mexico state director
for NRA testifying in opposition
to house bill nine we agree with
the Sanchez goal of promoting
safe and responsible gun
ownership we just disagree on
the approach and ari in the farm
industry believe that education
rather than punitive legislation
is the best approach the
national shooting sports
foundation teamed with
Albuquerque officials to launch
project child safe in that city
and distributed gun locks and
farm safety kits to the
community and raise the legal
probe gun safe program has
taught over two hundred seventy
five thousand New Mexico school
children that if they it
encounter gone unsupervised they
should stop.
Don't touch it.
Right away and tell a grown up.
Reddit.
Sorry the state should invest in
such programs as its local
counterparts have done to their
credit HB night is authors did
not include unenforceable
unconstitutional and unworkable
mandatory storage requirements
in the bill I appreciate the
dialogue the sponsors of had
with gun owners on this topic
and although we still oppose
this measure we we do so
respectfully thank you.
Zacks port.
Madam chair members of the
committee my name is out courts
on the president of New Mexico
shooting sports association
collectively represent the
interests of thousands of New
Mexico gun owners we
respectfully oppose the
legislation presented here
tonight for a multitude of
different reasons the first
reason is New Mexico already has
extensive child endangerment
statutes which someone who
places the child in a dangerous
situation with a firearm could
be charged under already this is
happened numerous times before
however there appears to be a
current lack of enforcement
we're in cases where it could be
enforced we strongly encourage
members of this committee to
consider this as Forsman
occurring system child
endangerment statutes could.
What would already do what this
bill aims to do we also of
course strongly opposed to the
fee structure in the bill as it
could price out lower income New
Mexicans from exercising their
right under the United States
constitution and the state
constitution to own a fire we
respectfully ask you oppose this
bill.
On.
Well as Hans.
Tom Sather.
Com seven.
Sorry I was needed.
Hello madam chair and committee
members my name is Thomas out
there on a fifty five year
resident of New Mexico a retiree
from Sandia national labs and I
am the legislative affairs
officer New Mexico shooting
sports association which is been
representing gun owners in New
Mexico since nineteen thirty
five we believe that many more
tragic incidents could be
avoided if children are educated
on what to do they come across
an unsecured firearm rather
waiting for an incident that
happen and in punishing the
person responsible for not
safely securing storing the
firearm but there is no
educational or community
outreach component to this bill
such as NRA's Eddie eagle child
accident prevention program or
the national shooting sports
foundation's project child state
farm's safety kit giveaways New
Mexico already has laws on the
books to hold adults accountable
for engaging the child why are
we insisting that children be
educated on how to be safe if
they come across far or stop
don't touch tone build we are
urging the committee members to
vote no on H. B. line as written
thank you.
Derek Scott.
Hello madam chairman members of
the committee my name star star
I.
Talked to earlier today
on this bill this is another one
that I've been waiting on like I
said I'm running for share and
you're asking that I think you
don't understand that there's a
place in this bill that I think
you will not.
Or even Sanchez might not see is
the fact that if a minor
protects themselves at their
home or on the property.
They could still be charged with
this charged so can the owner
for self defense I wouldn't for
this committee not low out is to
go through because of that more
major oversight here that a hot
to trot prosecutor can prosecute
the parents and the child for
self defense of their property
their person if they were to be
attacked for major bodily harm
or death so I would implore that
the people here in this
committee not let it go through
thank you.
Mary Ann Martin guy goes.
Can you hear me.
Hello yes we can hear you thank
you very much madam chair of all
the committee members I want to
extend my appreciation to the
committee to express my opinion
opposition of house bill nine my
position is not to go against
any law that is designed to
protect our state's use or
anyone for that matter however
New Mexico has such laws on the
books.
Especially if it's intended to
protect children lawmakers
should look at what laws exist
and introduce amendments to
strengthen the loss which hold
those who put anyone young old
or any demographic of our
population which is deemed
vulnerable in danger regardless
as to the method dangerous
conditions that exist in the
home include mental health
issues poverty drug and alcohol
abuse bullying that existing
homes or institutions of various
public and private organizations
access to motor vehicles and
weapons regardless as to the
type.
As we know once these conditions
all the way to a point where a
decision is consciously made to
act in a violent manner what
conditions can be imposed and
once home to make it safe would
be impossible to police without
violating someone's
constitutional rights.
This bill does not address and
what hasn't been discussed this
what prevention method or
preemptive measures that could
be afforded to parents or those
households we're a parent or
person of legal age can possess
weapons for self defense without
being in violation of the law if
we reach out to those programs
that exist are Sir your time has
elapsed thank you very much.
Jamie Fraser rate.
Madam chair members of the
committee when we raised in
John the vice chairman of that
shooting sports association.
Our long.
I am urging the committee to
vote no on the bill written a
function technical problems I
find that the language in the
penalty section there's not
mention any exemption for a case
where the gun was secured as
reference section at subsection
four were securely stored is to
provide well the penalties apply
even if the fire are which you
surely store per the definition
in that section.
Wraps language in section B.
should be amended to reflect it
securely storing the firearm is
an exemption from the penalties
in the bill I have no issue
whatsoever with the idea that my
firearm is my responsibility I
have been owner and user of
firearms for something over
fifty six years thank you for
your time.
What no please.
Hans.
there is no I'm sorry an unmute
Yes I'm a criminal defense
attorney in Albuquerque New one
thing I've learned over going on
I don't know eighteen years is
that criminals don't obey the
laws and this this bill will do
nothing to protect children and
it will do nothing to
to make of gun owners more
responsible because the same
people that will not obey this
law will not obey it any way and
it's the type of law that you're
only going to find out about
after something is happened and
frankly
if you make it a felony and then
it's tacked on in in your letter
II of the bill it talks about
the the other crimes this is
going to be a throwaway crime to
negotiate a plea and so it there
may be a bill that may
accomplish what you're looking
for but I don't think this is
the one and I would urge you to
vote no thank you so much.
Madam chair that was the final
attendees speaking in opposition
okay thank you let's go to those
in support of this bill.
H. P. line.
If you'll raise your hand
please.
Regino griega.
Thank you madam chairwoman
opportunity to speak to you
an important H. B. line my name
is Regina Griego I'm from
Albuquerque New Mexico I'm a
retired engineer and an author I
am a wife mother and grandmother
now I speak out for common sense
gun laws I am a volunteer for
moms demand action this story is
about a perfect storm but I of
my family members all victims of
gun violence committed by my
troubled nephew.
But nine years ago and it
changed my life and the lives of
many I wish it would have I wish
I would have been more vigilant
about what was happening in my
brother's house including the
fact that he kept eight guns and
ample ammunition all unsecured
and therefore accessible to any
of the four children.
Firearms are the leading cause
of death for children in our
state we must prioritize keeping
them safe at home and at school
why take the chance of having a
child unintentionally shoot
themselves or others especially
when we know that that it can be
prevented it's time for
lawmakers to act and they to
save New Mexico live and that
start by passing your storage
legislation immediately
immediately I am convinced that
my family members would still be
alive today if those fire arm
had been safely stored I can
tell you that the ripple effect
of gun violence is devastating I
apologize your time has elapsed
thank you.
Alexandria and needs.
Thank you good evening madam
chair members of the committee
my name Alexandria Taylor and
I'm a member of the New Mexico
Black central organizing
committee we support house bill
nine as women moms on TV's and
community activists we work to
create a world where children
are able to live long full and
thriving live not to be cut
short by others actions it is
terrifying that children in
middle school have access to
guns to take to school we
support smart measures to
prevent violent crime and to see
our children School potential
actualized for this reason we
ask the to support H. B. line
thank you.
Catherine believer.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee my name
is Katherine I'm a moms demand
action volunteer and I have two
boys who currently attend public
school here in Albuquerque.
I'm a very young age my boys and
their teachers were subject to
active shooter drills causing
recurring anxiety and trauma for
all parties involved I was
surprised to learn from several
studies including one from the
U. S. secret service that
between seventy three to eighty
percent of school shooters
obtained their guns from their
own home relative's home or
friends during the COVID many of
our children were at home all
day giving them a reprieve from
these drills unfortunately it
did not keep our children safe
firearms are the leading cause
of death for children in our
state and in twenty twenty and
according to Albuquerque police
there was a seventeen percent
rise and unintentional shootings
in Albuquerque this commonsense
legislation can help put a stop
to countless deaths and injuries
and keep our children safe I ask
for your full support of that
thank you.
Judge brown.
Madam chair members thank you my
name is Josh from the deputy
chief Health Service without
cookies Department.
in this last legislative session
well account number for payment
much of this year's I think it's
important that we realize that
this person amount of crime is
conducted by are you.
The house of children across to
to step more and keep more
children safe.
Law enforcement perspective it
was on options and then respond
more crimes have been committed
on children by children.
Did you see the impact of
victims families with accidental
or accidental.
Fifty one accidental shootings
occurred in Albuquerque last
year.
Some of these are involving
juveniles.
This is can be mitigated by
keeping farmers possibly out of
the hands of our youth.
Departments of its for possible
money thank you.
Our end of the screen it.
Madam chair members of the
committee my name is members
schooling of co president of New
Mexicans to prevent gun violence
I want to thank Representative
heard and for working on a child
access prevention bill gun
owners have a certain duties to
prevent child access to firearms
we are losing close to three
children every month in New
Mexico to gun violence.
In our opinion H. B. line does
need some amendments which you
have shared with Representative
heard and these amendments
without these members this bill
worked worked to pass would make
it harder to prosecute parents
and it is already hard enough us
with the case of any Hargrove
making it unlawful for child
access a firearm without
authorization by the gun over
owner and unlawful act would
potentially fit within the
theory of involuntary
manslaughter this is a good
concept except for the week
criminal penalties in the bill
that biggest language in the
double jeopardy issue as pointed
out by the AG's office in FY are
it is our hope that we can make
the necessary amendments and H.
B. line so that we can pass a
viable child access prevention
law as our children deserve to
be safe from gun violence in New
Mexico thank you very much.
Hello any guy.
Madam chair members of the
committee on millisecond former
Oregon legislature legislator on
the consumer protection and
health care committees
testifying in strong support of
H. B. line fire arms of the
leading cause of death for
children and teens in the US in
in New Mexico with accidents and
suicides as leading causes I've
included in my written testimony
links to many kinds safety
studies for instance a study
released just last week by
Everytown for gun safety which
shows that states with weak gun
laws are tied to increase gun
deaths New Mexico's gun safety
laws are weaker than some states
and it's rates of gun violence
are worse than many I've also
included a link to Oregon state
storage Bill SB I I for which
passed in twenty twenty one but
the support of moms demand
action and gun owners for
responsible gun ownership it
requires that an owner or
possessor of a firearm a secure
the gun when it's in their home
or being transported and to
report it as lost or stolen
within seventy two hours well
that bill goes farther than H.
B. line item that it requires
safe storage to prevent anyone
of any age from accessing a gun
without permission the speed
line is a good step that will
prevent tragedies and protect
children and families thank you.
Daymon Martinez with APD.
Madam chair.
Madam chair members of the
committee good evening this is
Damon Martinez some senior
policy adviser for the
Albuquerque police department.
In addition to APD standing in
support for this bill the City
of Albuquerque also does this
last summer more killer hosted
the most of the metro crime
initiative.
This brought the community
partners together and together
we came out with forty
initiatives and one of those
initiatives was to secure
weapons and so after listening
to community members from all
parts it became evident that
this is a serious issue and it
affects all of New Mexico.
By by passing this bill into law
which what it will serve as is
not only a deterrent but it will
also help educate gun owners so
we ask for you to pass this
tonight thank you.
Catherine of the the.
We apologize I I don't think I I
think I had that by accident.
Thank you clued said everyone
signed up for public comment
Madam.
Thank you.
do you have anything else you'd
like to add Sanchez.
Madam chair members of the
committee thank you very much
for allowing us to present this
bill tonight there is a
misconception that we heard
during the public testimony for
example in self defense that
this bill would apply to create
the committee I just point out
that the bill specifically
stands in the commission of a
crime.
Not in the commission of a crime
I just wanted to make sure that
the committee and madam chair
recognizes that point this bill
is it's only focused on the
safety of our children.
And remember and remind
individuals that your gun and
your responsibility thank you
madam chair.
Madam chair we just would like
to point out that most people
who spoke in opposition to the
bill.
From the fact that gun owners
have a responsibility.
With regard.
What this bill would also like
to appreciate very much the
perspective of the array that a
child should run away from.
Thank you.
Thank you okay we'll go to the
committee Representative
Thomson.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you for presenting this bill so
I heard several times about the
in our kids to get the kids to
tell an adult and run away and
all that and it would be great
if they did but many don't
there's been a lot of studies
the REC particularly boys they
are just drawn to to weapons I
think I mean you if you're with
little boys that pretty soon
their sticks will be stored I
mean that's just how so I wish
that that were I have an answer
but I'm afraid it's not and I
will just tell you madam chair
some years back in in this
committee we had a we had a
hearing on gun safety and then
there was a family there who who
had two toddlers and one of
their toddlers had autism in the
state we teach our son not to
touch the gun and what came in
my head as my son with autism
thank don't touch the Cape don't
touch the cake don't touch that
cake me he knew the words as he
would say the word as he was
doing the action so I just I
worry about kids there are
issues with this bill that needs
to be addressed but I'm I think
it's a good first first step and
I'm thank you madam chair.
Thank you Representative
Pettigrew.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you presenters your bill
I appreciate your passion.
We're gonna disagree on almost
every aspect of this bill.
But I appreciate your passion in
your in your debt desire to.
To work on some things.
My first call it madam chair is
is.
The opening statement you're
gun your responsibility.
I agree one hundred percent with
that statement.
I wish.
The majority of the legislation
that was being pushed through
with respect to crime civil
civil come to these criminal
penalties and everything else.
Had the same objective.
I listen to bills on Tuesday I
listen to bills today the tape
the personal responsibility away
from the offender.
I listen to bills on utilities
were people or for or
Madam chair and presenters on on
rare frights we're.
So may negotiate a contract
you're right or verbal and then
chooses to violate that
contract.
We give them a pass.
This concerns me the dichotomy
in the voice coming from and and
these bills.
And I don't understand it my
mind cannot wraparound.
That dichotomy.
Specifically with with.
Madam chair.
Passing laws that.
Truly affect law abiding
citizens.
Is in my opinion silly.
It doesn't.
We have heard more on senior
events.
One off of that Scranton there's
nationwide they happen.
Then we have.
On the murder rate in the
violence in Albuquerque.
We've heard bills or we've
heard.
Issues.
Your after we had members of our
own body.
And at the national level.
Very openly about the need to do
fun police.
Now bringing.
Gun violence in different
different bills out there
because we for at least so much.
When we pull back so much that
now we need to take a stand no
we should have kept are stamped.
This concerns me that we're
going after madam chair and
presenters that we're going
after for the majority ninety
nine percent law abiding
citizens not.
Going after I can drive down
central tonight if I wanted to
go to Albuquerque by Agence for
fifty Bucks Representative could
you keep it to the issues of the
bill please well I think I'm
right on target with the issues
of the bill madam chair.
And.
Are you asking a question about
the bill.
I will get to it yes yes manage.
And
Another point before I get to a
question.
The other day in this committee.
One of my colleagues made the
statement.
That
We don't need to add laws just
to add what's.
Current laws on the books.
That are dust good our our
police departments can use.
I've got.
Probably a hundred emails from
different law enforcement
agencies around the state.
The rich to those.
Very specifically we have NMSA
thirty dash six that's one.
That would that could have been
dealt with with the Hargrove
incident.
Why do we need this law.
That's my first question madam
chair.
Madam chair of I want to but
answer would be happy to do that
that is yes please yes so we
cannot answer for everything a
bill that's been introduced the
session however this bill.
We need this law because.
While in in the situation
happened at west middle school.
I think we agree that there are
probably some felonies that
could be applied.
We're interested in a graduated
approach we want our people have
to always involved law
enforcement one of our people
that we have to go to public
would like to have a graduated
approach that's reasonable.
That provides a certain level
prevention but that does not
preclude.
The felony prosecutions when
they are warranted.
But that does not push people in
that direction when it's not
worked thank you.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Senator for your response
I just feel very strongly that.
We should be using.
The ammunition that we have.
In the way of statutes instead
of creating ammunition that
actually hurt someone it will be
interesting madam chair and it
will be interesting presenters
that as we go through the
session and and bills are
presented in front of you all
that reduce and oak trees and
reduce crime reduce fines.
How those those will occur.
In comparison to this one that
increases.
Certain aspects and so that will
be interesting I significant
high school I I don't even have
the right words work I I oppose
this bill on every level.
Thank you Representative.
Are you suggesting that I'm done
madam chair I wasn't sure
sounded like it.
So with that I will I will yield
back and
Thank you.
Thank you Representative Lord.
Madam chair.
Hold on one second I'm gonna
have to step out of the room
otherwise nobody can hear what
I'm saying because fine right
but as soon as they turn the
speakers up so they can hear
everybody can hear the audience
they won't be able to hear any
more so give me one second.
Because we have our people in
the audience.
We can't turn the speaker down.
The public to do this okay.
All right.
The hallway now something
gathering some madam chair
Senator Representative I'm.
As a couple things that I'm
concerned about what this bill.
Especially research talk about
Celanese.
The reason why is because I've
heard so many times the pipeline
to present be used over and over
and over again.
And once you get a felony you
actually lose your second that
right.
So what I'm trying to look at
is.
When somebody is charged with a
felony.
And what state they're a low
income person.
And did they go with the public
defender may not be able to get
the representation that they
need to be able to bail out.
Now that person's going to lose
their job and lose their
freedoms so this becomes much
more than.
What the
Initial bill is brought up to be
sh.
Around like what happens because
when I was a kid I was raised by
two lesbians to California we
had a kind of the house my one
mom was a shot as my other mom
we was cation and we had guns in
the house and when I was a kid
we were taught don't touch the
gun my mom would have beaten me
had a touch that gun she taught
me from it very early age not to
touch you guys tell me about gun
safety.
And then when I went to high
school are we had gun club.
There were guns everywhere
they're gonna locker server guns
and pick up trucks there were
guns everywhere and I can't to
to generate what what happened
between that pair and now.
Where before we were all being
taught gun safety and I think
that's the key the key back then
in that era we were taught gun
safety with a very firm parent
who would have paddled you for
touching a gun and taught you
about gun safety.
So with everything that we
always do.
With all the bills that we
present we're always trying to
do prevention like how do we
keep kids off of drugs will
education how do we you know
keep kids from getting pregnant
as education except when it
comes to guns when it comes to
guns as well as harshest
penalties ever locked up the
parents with the felony charge
in my thousand dollars.
Yes please keep your questions
to the Sanchez about the bill I
am this is all about the bill
this is actually everything I'm
saying and I know this is second
time you've reprimanded me for
that if we have to work right
goals person down to talk about
it but no I'm talking about the
bill.
The issue is.
We have a bill that we want to
do the pipeline to prison with
parents we want to charge a
thousand dollars when I could
have sworn I just heard in
previous bill that charging
people money was hard on them
and then that will be locked up
and we can't get those funds
from them anyways so I guess the
answer to this bill is they can
do the jail time like in the
previous bell.
But we're punishing the parents
so I'm gonna get to my question
I have about and this is a
question Madam chair for the
presenters of the bill.
Let's just say that.
Because living warily it takes a
long time for law enforcement to
get to your home.
Let's say that there's a sixteen
year old girl and her parents
lever at home they have she's
responsible she has a gun there
because god forbid we want to
get our murder rate so we need
to go on there and she knows how
to use it and the panelists are
gonna go out for the night.
The girl let's just say girls
and girls of that age invite a
friend over.
The friend she tells a friend
not to touch a gun the friend
goes ahead and let's say touches
a gun uses that accidentally got
it shoots the girls are those
parents responsible for what's.
A girl who did not have
permission I see are they
responsible for her using the
gun.
Would that be the
responsibility.
That was a question.
Thank you madam chair and the
I'm gonna speak up just a little
bit we got a text message that
you were having difficulty
hearing us that's not something
I normally hear from both yes
thank you to allow delivery no
but that's the reason for us.
You know first of all.
We we agree with you completely
in terms of.
The attitude better to moms and
children you.
The attitude that of responsible
gun ownership.
This bill would not apply under
those circumstances.
On the other hand let's let's
take your example.
Leave the leave the girl at home
and they also.
Leave the and then and then she
invites a friend over.
And a tragic happens you know
that point break that's going to
be a a judgment call for the
prosecutor.
what to do and that kind of a
situation.
We'll have to do with you know a
bride of the of the facts.
For example the the Michigan
case that happened recently.
Where the parents were charged
with the volunteer month
manslaughter it was a very fact
specific case.
The very fact specific case in
terms of of the text messages of
the of the social media postings
of the timing.
Of the
etcetera that happened in terms
of that particular situation so
what would the result be I I
can't really really tight would
result will be I will to the
other issues that you raised
however.
Want to make it very clear of
positive our penalty assessment
of the penalties which means
there is no jail time the goals
that.
So so more access to a gun.
Eight thousand dollars nowadays
that's.
Representative.
And I in practice bill we're
very careful to craft a bill
that that at that level.
There was not only no
expectation jail time there is a
possibility of jail time.
That would come with that that's
what's written as a penalty
assessment and not as a full
misdemeanor which is where it
goes if the child uses the got
the gun the question across.
Thank you senator thank you
madam chair for to answer that
question sh what I'm trying to
figure out is where is the line
with this bill
if we have a sixteen year old
and they're going to a shooting
competition.
Let's just say they go shooting
competition they have expressed
usage of the gun again if that
gun is used by somebody else in
the crime I'm trying to figure
out where the parents.
Are going to be punished and
where they are not so with that
being a similar situation to
where Sarmad Ali where
This person would not be
responsible to transfer
responsible for what happens
with that gun well the.
Child is involved in the
shooting optician first of all.
I would presume without knowing.
The child was involved in the
shooting competition has their
parent or guardian permission to
be involved in the shooting up
to.
That would be around there would
be no penalty assessments that
could be possible because the
guns would be around that point
would be in a situation where
where the child is very
guardian's permission be wrong
they got.
However if the person
responsible for that shooting
competition.
Was careless with the guns.
Attention to how many grams they
have.
Didn't require the guns
responsibly to be stored
afterward.
One of the children walk away
with one of the guns of the
child later on use that gun in
the commission of a crime yes
whoever is responsible that
competition that would be under
this bill responsible has that
been the reverse responsible for
storing the data.
Thank you Senator Representative
met madam chair so.
We're going with all this is I'm
trying to make sure that we
don't start putting people in
the pipeline to prison I'm also
trying to make sure that we are
going to penalize those with low
income or people of color
because they can't afford a
safe.
To me I think honestly a much
better approach because I go
back to what I said earlier
venture was just ties back to
this question in my era we did
have guns and they were around
and they were everywhere they
were jurors and they weren't
being used as a responsibly so
I'm trying to get back to what
happened and how do we fix that
I keep going back to education I
keep going back to giving out
free done lost because I don't
want to penalize anybody who's
low income who can't afford a
thousand dollar fine and can't
afford a gun safe and they're
trying to do the best due
diligence they can and still
something happens my other big
concern is.
I think about single moms who
are let's say who have left an
abusive situation and the axes
wants to kill them and they're
trying to keep a fire arm
accessible that they can no
longer get to so I'm trying to
get our perspective that
Responsible gun owners are
punished and and that and always
with the done bills I always
feel like it's the responsible
gun owners to get punished and
the ones who don't give a flying
heck about this bill at all
we're just gonna do what they
want and leave guns later other
still gonna do it anyway share
so I keep going back to the
education portion of that to
make sure that our legal gun
owner still have accessibility
to their guns and we are sending
people you know we're at any
given people felonies and we are
still finding people when they
can't afford it or deserve it sh
so with that I do yield my time
thank you.
Madam chair your thank you
Representative Romero thank you.
Thank you madam chair thank you
to the sponsors for the intent
of the bill I'm mostly concerned
with some of the technicality in
language that we've seen in many
of the analyses in particular
the double jeopardy provision
and in how someone may be able
to be prosecuted if you look at
what has been flagged for us
both in the FY are and in
several of the issue
different analyses that we've
seen if you are looking at
significant issues on the master
FY are page three that talks
about the language used in
subsection eve that talk but
says nothing in this section
shall be construed to prohibit
the concurrent prosecution of
the person.
and the way that it's red from
multiple sources is that that
made prohibit
Prosecution and other areas with
the use of the firearm should it
be removed I'm so my challenge
with this is the way that it's
worded now could cause that
confusion confusion and perhaps
up and other forms of law that
maybe unintended
So so that's the major red flag
I think that just on a technical
issue from my perspective could
deal with the intent of of the
bill overall I don't know the
Sanchez have a response to that.
Thank you madam chair
Representative
We actually agree with you on
that we didn't get the FIR till.
It would be for the hearing of
what we do agree with you on the
on that issue and that's
something that we're going to
work on.
between I should this should
this bill continue between here
and the next committee and back
we would love to work with you
to also serve on a committee I
believe
on on of the amendments that we
would incorporate into the bill.
So that when we get to the
committee they're all prepared
and ready to go.
Thank you madam chair for that
matter and some of the other I
think technical issues in the
some of the.
Way that the definition of
storing a firearm there some
great recommendations about
ammunition storage as well as
with the storage of the gun
Some of the I and I would love
to continue this offline because
I do support the intent of the
bill I do I would love to see
this continue on and I know that
Representative Brandon has
worked really hard to keep this
in the session and and dean this
germane and I super appreciate
that and and the intent
I would just recommend a no
recommendation for passage in
order to make those continued
At its and and with
understanding how much that
needs to be revised as far as
some of the technical issues
that have been brought up today
and and those that in the late
analysis I think that most of us
received
that said I appreciate where
it's headed I know it's very
timely understanding what's
going on and and in districts
around the state and and I
appreciate the passion and
compassion of the bill that's
the intended
That said I'll just all stopped
there would love to work with
the Sanchez and I don't know
where it goes next I'm Senator
used you probably know but I'm
happy to to continue with that
thank you madam chair.
Thank you seeing no other
questioning from the committee
is there what is the will of the
committee madam chair chair I
made to take No I'm sorry it's
already been started
representative Thompson spoke
first.
I move to pass without
recommendation.

recommendation do I hear a
second.
I can secondary madam chair so
there's just to clarify is there
a do passports the past with not
without recommendation so no
recommendation are Agnes code
motion is that right
Representative Thomson.
You're you're the
parliamentarian.
If if the intent is no
recommendation it's is that the
building had wrecked my mic my
intent is that this move on I'm
I think it's Judiciary that it
move on to Judiciary to get a
really close look at it but
telling them we have concerns.
So madam chair I made clear by
the
It's a passage without
recommendation.
