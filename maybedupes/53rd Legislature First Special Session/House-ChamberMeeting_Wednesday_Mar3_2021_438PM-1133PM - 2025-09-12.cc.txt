Mr speaker and members of the
House good afternoon Mister
speaker I move that we go to the
next order of business
announcements and miscellaneous
business.
Mr speaker hearing of session is
so ordered.
members as we start I want to
ask Miss.
Body to take a moment we lost.
one of our dearest.
And the closest and most long
serving members.
And the early hours of this
morning.
Former representative at Santa.
Passed away.
this morning.
After a long struggle with COVID
nineteen he.
Thankfully was joined
at a side with his beloved
Loretta and his daughter
Christina as he passed.
He had I think a very long
struggle with that terrible.
I disease he did have an
opportunity thankfully to speak
to many of us.
During his hospitalization.
He.
I was I think
If not the most one of the
kindest.
Most thoughtful.
Most giving.
human beings let alone public
servants.
When he left this body after
the Indian five twenty fourteen
we suffered a tremendous loss.
The boy that he fills in the
taxation revenue Committee was
enormous but also.
The good humor and the selfless
spirit with which she served his
constituents in the state.
He left us with an enormous loss
as well.
He he and I share an office.
Suite for four years.
And one of the great pleasures
that I had was.
Every morning every every day
hearing him.
Last with the members of the
staff.
Greeting the school children
they would come to visit him.
Of the.
Absolutely.
Glimmer in his eye and smile on
his face as he shared and
delivered.
Of a red is famous rum cakes.
which are legend in this
building.
And the way he always took a
moment might my children my
daughters were quite young at
the time the initiative that
sweet and on occasion and
committee meetings there on the
weekends I didn't have any place
to put my two little girls other
than on that catch my office why
Senate committee you never
always make sure to go in and.
He and to participate around
used to love to give one folded
up one dollar bill or piece of
hard candy you're always make a
point of going in and Cheryl the
love with that with my girls and
I will be forever grateful for
that the kindness the show to my
wife my whole family and was.
Really just beyond description
and I am.
I'm very very sorry to
Right at increase loss sorry I
have to share this news with the
body.
but he.
He left a huge impression on me
and I know everyone with whom he
served
I know there's going and quite a
number of members of one offer a
word.
in honor of chairman Santa as we
start that maybe please stand
for a moment of silence in honor
of the check.
Thank you members.
Increasing I can I can see is
the ways and see Santa that I.
I can't tell was middle name
stood for for certain because he
had a joke going with the former
chief clerk.
Steve R. is that every time.
Steve would read out a tax
committee committee report he
would make up a name for this
scene is name and.
It was.
Curtis.
Charlie.
Cornelius and I I always thought
Steve was reading it wrong or
that it was messing with the
chief clerk and how you write
that out to one day just the
committee report was submitted
by and cheaper Kabra.
Santa and I knew that point that
the joke was on that was on the
rest of us
Members of I'd like to start
with a general from Bernalillo
the chairman Martinez.
Thank you Mr speaker for for
that wonderful remembrance of of
the good chair it was on the
line.
Up you know as it is as I've
mentioned many times Mr speaker
the first time I set foot in
that wonderful capitol building
of ours
I was probably no older than
twenty or twenty one years old.
and here was this may he Connell
with no political connection or
influence or anything
to this day my parents don't.
Bill contributes to political
campaigns or anything not even
money believe it or not
and so I showed up and you know
a lot of doors
a lot of doors in in in that
beautiful capital of ours don't
open up for for for kids like
me.
But there are two in particular.
Who made it a point to open
their door and to welcome us to
their office and to speak with
us as equals one of them was
Chairman representative Rick
Miera in the old one was
chairman and works on the one.
And Mister speaker as my own
legislative career has has taken
shape.
as my my my only work within our
legislature has taken place.
I always think of to legislate
tors but I want to make sure I
never disappoints.
And one of them was my
predecessor chairman Rick Miera
and the other one well as
chairman and which on the one.
Mr speaker I didn't have the
blessing of serving with
chairman so the one.
but I can tell you until
recently we were exchanging
Facebook.
Comments
I never had the opportunity to
ask him.
How can start we were doing.
I never had the opportunity to
us how he thought I was doing
and and and I regret that.
Up but I suspect that in terms
of the violence very jovial and
sort of funny way he probably
would have given me a great deal
of candy yes.
He probably would give me a hard
time for books that I've taken
or bills that if passed.
and Mr speaker members of the
body.
as as the new the incoming chair
of house taxation revenue
committee
I want to extend our deepest
sympathies to chairman
subdivides family to his friends
I was texting with
Representative maybe our here
they were they were like
brothers
he it is a tremendous loss for
his family and it is a
tremendous loss for the entire
state of New Mexico Mr speaker
may may god rest chairman Santa
soul behalf of our entire
committee
we wish his family.
only the best in these very
difficult difficult days
you can even.
It terminates and about thank
you Mr speaker.
Thank you John and I I didn't
tell you the last one the last
conversation I had with with and
I asked him the question about
you and I can tell you he was
very.
Very proud of you chairman.
Of next.
We had a gentlelady from
Bernalillo I have Representative
Debbie Armstrong.
Thank you Mr speaker and I was
so saddened to hear the news
today
I first met chairman Santa when
I was secretary of aging because
we would we would have capital
projects and have to come in
front of the capitol
subcommittee of tax and so got
to know him over the years but I
didn't get to serve with them
because I serve in his state and
I still consider this his seat
use enormously big shoes to
fill.
beloved by his constituents and
the and the community in the
north valley.
He has such a wonderful sense of
humor larger than life he has
won his favorite projects in the
district is little league field
to work years to get level it
feels and he'd be out there for
every little league game and the
zero help zero the first pitch
little league he loved children.
he was he knew his constituents
he asked me about my mother
every time I talk to
and he is just such a huge
heart.
And
sorely missed
in a loss to the state a great
loss to the north valley.
And may he rest in peace thank
you Mr speaker.
Thank you generating next we
have the gentle lady from
Bernalillo Representative
Chasey.
Thank you Mr speaker and
I appreciate your tribute to Mr
chairman Senate and all.
Representative Armstrong
Representative Martinez's.
You know we have been
corresponding on Facebook and I
I really had to leave that
because he had fought it for so
long it was going to prevail.
So I was really sad today when I
heard the news.
But I just want to tell you what
a happy man he was.
When we were freshmen Senator
Lopez and I.
Started doing.
We work with our wards and
precincts and we had a gathering
over at Representative now does
hold and we have a bunch of
people there are pot luck was
really fun one of the things we.
We did is we asked.
People kind of as an ice breaker
if you can.
Come back as anyone in the world
what would it be and.
The Boston I would come back as
Loretta assessment which is
courses who request but he love
love love Loretta so much that
was his choice some people were
saying Abraham Lincoln and you
know.
You wanted to be around a
thousand and there was nothing
he wanted more than that.
But
He was a force of nature and I
think it is
his incredible.
Presence and his spirit in his
humor is probably what motivated
of chief clerk Steve ideas to
give him a new middle name every
time he read the reports from
the house taxes committee.
But.
The thing about chairman Santa
is he's the only one I've ever
known who didn't need a Mike on
the floor although full market
Majority Leader comes close
sometimes she could not compete
with some of them of all and you
know.
We would sometimes joke about is
my
I I feel so grateful to have
known him to have walked beside
him in this life.
And he really is the one who got
me started on.
To do diversion from prison by
treating.
mental health issues are very
early on he got me interested in
that and the fact that we have
mental health parity in New
Mexico that's something that he
worked on with senator Domenici
because senator Domenici did
back at federal level so I I
just want to recognize his
accomplishments and extend my
deep condolences to his beloved
family the reddit and Christina
and all the grandchildren and
And again say how grateful I am
to have.
What we signed him for part of
my life.
Thank you gentle lady next year
the gentle lady from Bernalillo
Representative Thomson.
Thank you Mr speaker and I will
be very brief because I just I
agree with what everybody said
wouldn't chairman Martinez
talked about one of the you know
somebody you never wanted to
disappoint that was that was
chairman and Santa he he he was
there when I was a freshman and
he just made me feel like I
belong there like what I was
working on was important that
behavioral health staff we we
worked on together it everyone
has said he was bigger than life
he was he was just a nice man I
mean.
You could say anything about him
but it always came back to he
was a nice man and he in Loretta
we're just the epitome of a cute
couple they would hold pay and I
don't know how many decades they
have been married but they just
work your quintessential cute
couple I remember one weekend I
saw them out for breakfast at a
restaurant and they didn't see
me and I didn't see our table
and we we kind of spied on them
and they were just as cute as
could be and now I I I I know
she's going to be lost without
him.
And may he rest in peace thank
you.
Thank you.
Gentlelady.
I'm next to the gentleman from
Santa Representative Harper.
Thank you Mr speaker
thank you for the great tribute
Terry Martinez as well and up
when we spoke in I really
enjoyed that remembering.
It's fine gentleman and a friend
she was my very first chair.
In the tax committee and
I'll tell you
Being a freshman in just now
always have the eyes wide open
just try to take everything in.
But that there are two.
Two members I just wanted to
share that I think.
we highlight to me what a great
man he was and how much we
missed the first is we were
debating on the house floor.
And she.
He asked me how do I pronounce
Santa.
Gentleman from Santa right.
And.
I thought for a minute you know
as we go okay.
Maybe we'll have a little fun
with this and I said well it's
very clear Mr speaker and
gentleman it's sand oval.
Two words Santa and I don't know
how he's gonna take it my son
cut caucus hood and squinted
eyes for a minute I was like oh
no I'm in big trouble
and then you just open the
amounts that big grin right and
he just I mean she just loved it
and as I don't care who I'm I'm
not in trouble.
And and later
after the sessions over
I was really touched use your
actually reached out.
And invited me and my wife to
dinner.
And I was just we're just us R.
and he you know we we laughed we
enjoyed a great deal but then he
helps this.
Freshman who's trying to find
his way and a wife who was you
know trying to find her way.
just give us great advice and
we're at a noticed was a really
sweet experience I can as well
my my my favorite and
the most meaningful experiences
that that freshman year I'm very
much in this.
Chairman Santa and
And I'm.
I wish in this family.
Rest in peace.
One is in a better place thank
you Mr speaker.
The gentleman next to the gentle
lady from Bernalillo
Representative Roybal Caballero.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you colleagues I I'm gonna try
to say this without crying
because I've been crying
The US since I heard.
Representative Representative
chairs on the line.
And as others mentioned house
Majority Leader Matt Ritter we
have a we're my mentors.
when I ate I sat across the
aisle from our representatives
on the line my first session and
I'm now sitting in the seat that
he currently
sat on for many years and
He was he.
He was testing me because he had
heard all about me so he said.
And so he was putting me to the
test when we first started
talking and
So there's there's speaking
Spanish.
And then there speaking hello.
I'm Spanish is the proper way to
speak Spanish.
And got a little is known as the
model.
language of Spanish and
So he knew that I love to speak
Spanish and I could speak
Spanish but he didn't realize
that I also was familiar with
got all.
And so
it's kind of the
and I think.
In Hispanic communities Latino
communities of when you're in
the mobile many of you might
know this and relate to it so
sometimes we'll just be talking
and all of a sudden something
and cattle comes out and it's
just.
What they call to go.
Talk and so he put me to the
tested me throughout.
Eight he greeted me and he
throughout a greeting that
income will.
And so I responded to him.
Income all any sense.
That's not very ladylike of you.
How do you know that.
And
I didn't you know I I said well
I know what you just so
Representative I'm just
answering you and then he he
cracked up and he said he was
just putting me to the test
because he wanted to measure
just how how much of it you
gonna was you know he wanted to
test that already heard any
wanted to know just how how deep
is that
she can be small that she has
and and the real test is going
to be whether she can she can
talk my talk page you can answer
my my my car law and so that was
our first icebreaker Mr chair so
then I told him I said okay
since we broke the ice on that
how are you are you going to
show me the ropes.
And he means that in his chair
and he just cracked up.
And he said you just stole my
line your young whipper snapper
here you just got elected you
come from bubble box you know
I'm waiting to hear what how you
what Representative you're going
to teach me.
And so Mr speaker and gentle
body and everyone who's spoke
and he you know he had this
incredible incredible sense of
humor
that you never knew you really
never never knew on whether you
were being teased
or serious the one thing that he
did tell me.
Because I ask them you know is
it permissible for me to speak
in Spanish.
because Spanish is kind of like
my first language I'd sometimes
things slip and I may be
debating and something might
just come out in Spanish as just
because that's part of my
upbringing that's part of what I
am what I am.
And he he joked and he gave me a
lesson in the constitution and
came sat me down and gave me a
lesson on
well it seems to me young lady
that you really don't know at
all so I'm gonna tell you.
And so he gave me this long
lesson and he says and if you
don't speak Spanish.
Then you're not to go near the
line you're not any of the when
I thought you came here to
represent so Mister speaker and
and and body
He actually gave me the
blessing.
And he actually said.
You speak from the heart.
Whatever comes out when you're
speaking from the heart.
That's what this body has to
accept.
He and
Majority Leader then I would
confer they would huddle in the
back and
When they would notice that I
was paying attention they would
whisper to themselves about
whether they needed to whether
it was okay to bring into the
huddle.
Then they would give me
conditions you can come into the
huddle if you believe in this
you can join the huddle if you
think this you can join us if
you're gonna do this.
So I'm as a mentor he and and
leader then at I could have
asked for better mentors for a
better introduction for better
grounding and a better
blessing.
That to know that what I was
doing.
I was meant to be doing.
And that they were there he was
there and he would extend
Hannity tell me cross the aisle
you just come and ask me
anything you want and I did.
And Mister speaker the final
thing I want to talk about just
real quickly is the other couple
because we often travel together
during the interim just to make
sure that they were okay we
would think we were making sure
they were OK we get out of the
inner meetings whatever they may
be and they would be right there
getting out at the same time
around the same time and they
say all you guys are safe we
were just following you to make
sure you got here okay.
So it became a thing where my
husband and I would.
Check here and see what
committees because we served on
the same interim committees and
they'd be taking M. but they
didn't want us to know that they
were checking in on this we felt
like they were they were our
parents that we were the younger
kids
and the they would say he would
say to
you see that Google
to be just like them.
We would do the same thing and
it was a thing so I'm I'm going
to miss the
The Facebook messages that he
would send.
My father he loved.
My father.
My father was his hero.
Those messages on my father's
birthday.
On the other state.
On state.
He
Amber because he remembered them
every single year.
Still.
So Mister speaker I'm sorry I'm
not sorry but I'm crying because
I know that he's out of his pain
we we texted communicated just
recently because I believe
wanted to come by and see him
but we weren't allowed we didn't
left the requirement.
Beauty of it all is that he
lasted this is the cycle of life
that I sold my vote so respect
because it's so meaningful.
He waited until Loretta
Christine Christine accord .
Be allowed to come in and see
him.
When I understand they held
hands.
We've heard it was okay for her
to leave him.
And so that was the last
Representative if you took.
Very happy for that because he
loves Loretta with all his might
have sold and that's the couple
that my husband and I want to be
and we.
Well thank you Mr speaker and
they get colleagues.
Next year the gentleman from
civil and we can the
Representative Alcon.
Thank you Mr speaker who know
the gentleman in Sunderland some
goals while leading the.
in many different names and
titles that you can read was the
also the manager Sir with the
only thing I want everybody to
remember is before there was
even a veterans interim
committee before there was even
a Veterans Committee on the
house floor.
Chairman miss on the latter was
the veterans demanded that arose
when do every piece of
legislation while I was here and
even before a concerned letter
orange was carried by chairman
Sunderland.
They don't care to veterans he
was a Vietnam vet himself and he
don't care to the insurance in
the state of New Mexico and for
that he does not get that much
credit.
But because he was tax everybody
just say stacks with he was the
letter is then.
The one thing that I will miss
is waking up Saturday mornings
and listening to him look at his
jokes okay and on the radio he
and I share the same birthday.
So of course I guess we should
have been birthday when in Santa
was on the radio so I'll never
forget the Germans and the law
using right then Sir with thank
you Mr speaker.
Thank you John next year the
gentleman from San Juan
Representative Strickler.
Thank you Mr chairman and and I
want to pay my respects to
chairman and Santa hi serve with
served on his committee for
eight years he was a good man.
He had he was kind of a Jack of
all trades he was a businessman

really appreciate Representative

already a program for many years

Thompson is Spanish radio

thank you Mr speaker the
gentleman listening gentlelady
from Bernalillo Representative
Stapleton.
Thank you Mr speaker members of
the house Mr speaker and members
of the house side I want to
recognize today the life of
Representative Santa June the
time that he has been here in
the house of representatives Mr
speaker and members of the house
I would like to share that
Representative Santa with a very
jovial individual and Rep mia
and him were best friends they
didn't do anything without each
other.
Representative Santa was always
wanted to be in charge of
redistricting to make sure that
everything went right with it
and he was also actually
sometimes in charge of capital
outlay.
Like Representative Armstrong
said Representative Santa he was
larger than life and he was
larger than life in this
legislature what
was different in that he's great
what that observe you doing in
the house of representatives was
working for New Mexico and he
was constantly Mr speaker
involved in making sure that
individuals children young
adults don't see lose who had
disability was represented right
and we see that the issue of
what was in the legislature for
them Mr speaker and members of
the body I would like to say
that his voice.
He's a and W. the radio station
was always lasting throughout
the day that one would listen to
New Mexico music was always
referring to K. and W. for many
years after he stopped and
members of the house so Mister
speaker.
The state may god bless and
comfort to his family at this
time and he left a lasting
impression on all of us will
serve with them in the house of
representatives to his district.
Community at large and the state
of New Mexico and I wish his
family well and abundance of
peace through god's grace thank
you Mr speaker.
Thank you generating.
Very much appreciate the members
of the house taking a moment to
recognize.
to resent of this family.
Are there other announcements
the gentleman from Chavis Eddy
and Otero.
Thank you Mr speaker
Yesterday.
I have.
Made the announcement that Texas
had opened up.
And
there were a couple of comments
made that I just felt compelled
to respond to.
One in particular.
Made the statement that the
Texans were Guinea pigs and said
if they died a well.
That.
I started to stand right at the
end but.
I thought I would probably be
better off thinking about it
before I said anything of.
But Mr speaker
Those Texans referred to.
As well as of.
You know if they die include my
grand children.
And the I expect more from this
body.
Mr speaker you said.
The two thought the actions of
the.
Governor we're a little
premature.
And I respect that.
But I will tell you that.
In Montgomery County Texas for
my grandkids live.
They have been in school.
Since September.
Second or third.
Last year.
Six months.
They have been riding the bus.
Playing golf.
Swim planned soccer in their in
class five days a week.
And.
And I think it's important
because I heard a couple of
comments that.
I think sometimes we stay here
so long that we forget what's
going on in the rest of the
world.
There's of about six hundred
thousand people in Montgomery
County Texas Bopp.
A third of the population in New
Mexico maybe a little less.
And the Conroe Independent
School system has built the
website.
This interactive with kids.
Teachers administrators and
parents.
In those kids go to school every
day.
They do.
Tempter surveys.
They monitor in different ways
if one of them is six there's a
little bar that goes out.
Parents are notified they help
watch parents are what's the
kids.
But those kids are living.
And they're enjoying
Everything.
That we want our kids to enjoy.
And to think that it can't be
done safely.
Is absolutely wrong it can be
done safely and I think if you
have any doubt.
Look at the Conroe Independent
School District website.
See how they do.
And I think instead of just them
saying.
That there again the peg.
They might be a model.
And the model might be something
that our kids would enjoy it too
thank you Mr speaker.
Thank you John the gentle lady

Gentlelady from Bernalillo.
Mr speaker I move that we go to
the next order of business third
reading of legislation no
objection it is so ordered
members we are going to start
with item thirty nine.
Gentleman from Bernalillo
Representative Martinez are you
prepared on that item.
I am please give it to that
point Mr speaker the record
reflect election necessary for
placing House taxation and
revenue committee substitute for
hostile to ninety one on final
passage has been taken gentleman
to explain the bill.
Thank you Mr speaker and members
of the body it is a great
pleasure to be here with you
tonight
House Bill to ninety one does a
few different things House Bill
to ninety one provides to fairly
large tax breaks to working
families and low wage earners in
New Mexico.
House Bill to ninety one
increases of the rebate of the
lowincome comprehensive tax
rebate this has not been updated
since nineteen ninety eight Mr
speaker
House Bill to ninety one also
Increases in working families
tax credit from the current
seventeen percent of your earned
income child care tracks credit
to twenty percent and it also
expands that credit to ensure
that we capture younger workers
who don't qualify for the
federal credit and working
families who file their taxes
with an individual taxpayer ID
number.
Mr speaker the bill creates
three new income tax brackets.
If you remember currently we
have a four point nine and a
five point nine bracket this one
creates one at five point five
percent.
It creates one at six point two
percent and then finally creates
a bracket at six point five
percent for the highest earners
these are pretty marginal tax
increases on those who can
afford it in order to pay for
the tax breaks that we are
seeking for lower income and
lower wage families
Mr speaker the bill also repeals
the capital gains deduction
except that
what we do is we create an
exemption for that business
owner that sells our business
you know all the hard working
family that built a business
over thirty years can still sell
their business ended up forty
percent of that capital gain
that is currently in the books
lastly Mr speaker this bill
addresses the the issue of
property tax where you have
people with second and third
holes and their rate is
artificially capped at three
percent and if I may Mister
speaker I'd like to yield to
both of my cool Sanchez to
expand a little bit on each of
those provisions specifically
elector and property tax and I'd
like to start with my co sponsor
the gentle lady from Los Alamos
Representative Chandler.
Gentlelady from Los Alamos Mr
speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo yield.
I yield to generate.
Thank you very much it's a
pleasure to be presenting on our
our expansion of elector are
increasing the litter and
Lichter stands for low income
comprehensive tax rebate in the
history of that provision I
think is really interesting
about thirty or so years ago
recognizing that our gross
receipts tax systems upon which
we really.
Rely heavily is regressive and
meaning it hits lower income
people disproportionately to
higher income people Lichter was
proposed as a partial way to
mollify that affect through the
income tax code so elector
provides rebates to people based
on income and family size or
otherwise known as exemptions
and it has not been updated in
terms of income or.
Rebate since nineteen ninety
eight as the chairman noted Mr
speaker and this bill proposes
to update the income levels and
exemptions based on inflation
that has occurred in those last
twenty two years or so and it
also adds US CPI so we won't
have to be revisiting this issue
every once in a while and this
is a very important provision in
the bill because it helps lower
income people buy insuring that
they get some money back in the
system that we all recognize to
be very regressive so thank you
very much and I yield the floor
back to the chair.
The gentleman from Bernalillo
thank you Mr speaker at next
like to yield to to the
gentleman from Santa Fe tors
Representative McQueen to expand
on property tax.
The gentleman from Bernalillo
Santa Fe Torrance and Valencia
Representative McQueen.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman so section five and
house bill two ninety one
address is sort of in in
overbroad mistake we made twenty
years ago twenty years ago there
was concern that people regain
priced other homes just based on
the property tax and this is
something that that I've
referred to as the little lady
on Kenyon road problem if you're
familiar Santa Fe real estate
Kenyon road is full of very high
end real estate up you also have
families that live there
literally for generations so you
might own the property but the
property taxes are going through
the roof and so the decision was
made to cap those property taxes
no comment increase of no more
than three percent a year to
protect those homeowners but
when the legislation was drafted
you just referred to residential
properties so it inadvertently
picked up not only the situation
that we're trying to address
some protect those homeowners
but it also predicted that
second homes and vacation
properties investment properties
and that was really never
hesitant we had some interesting
of public testimony on this in
tax committee and we have a
couple of members of the public
who were there at the adoption
and they were eager to have this
fixed with this bill does is.
Keeps the cap for owner occupied
primary residences and list the
cap over a period of time for
other properties thank you Mr
speaker thank you to all.
Thank you
Mr speaker and enjoyment I and
before I close I just want to
remind body of of a couple
things two years ago treatment
to heal she parted house bill
six and house bill six of
remember at the end of that
session resulted in a pretty
marginal tax increase in income
tax bracket it's we created one
other bracket when it was all
said and done and that was that
five point nine percent bracket
that only applied for joint
filers earning three hundred
fifteen thousand dollars or more
and this is taxable income so
this is after you take you know
all your deductions and whatnot.
everything else bill did really
focused on things that we have
to do it is a legislature we
sort of had agreed to do already
one of them was a internet sales
tax for example something that
this house passed the
legislature passed a at least
once before in the previous
governor had vetoed it was
something that really was meant
to level the playing field for
for small mom and pop businesses
here in New Mexico the other
thing that build it is was it
brought in nonprofit hospitals
any specific right into the G.
R. T. and of course that's uh
way to read generate revenue
that we've reinvested into
Medicaid but when it came down
to up to what was increased it
was pretty marginal that five
and five point nine percent that
scene bill increase working
families tax credit from ten
percent to seventeen percent of
the federal credit and it only
decreased the capital gains
deduction by ten percent used to
be fifteen it was brought down
to forty with that bill Mr
speaker up before we for
questions I I would like to go
to the delayed from the Saddam
was with your permission Mister
speaker because we do have a
technical amendment that we
would like to adopt today.
They're generally from Los
Alamos Mr speaker I have house
floor amendment number one to
house taxation and revenue
committee substitute for House
Bill to ninety one and eighty
two oh two number is two two
zero three seven seven point
two.
In general it has been passed
out of this on the website
gentlelady to explain the
amendment thank you very much Mr
speaker it this really is a
technical amendment and and it's
just changes one word on page
twelve from small business to
New Mexico business and in
addition it clarify it just
clarifying language to ensure
that we don't get crosswise
Mister speaker with the Commerce
Clause and it does that hi
instead of referring to New
Mexico residents online's online
twenty on page twelve we change
that language to referred to
tangible assets and being
located in New Mexico
the issue there Mr speaker has
to do with the fact of
distinguishing between residents
of different states and so on
and we have been advised by TRD
staff and our own internal staff
that this could percent of
Commerce Clause issue so we are
addressing it now Mr speaker and
with that I'm happy to entertain
questions Mr speaker and
gentleman from Bernalillo is is
a friendly amendment.
Yes it is Mr speaker Is there
debate on the amendment is there
objection to it.
Hearing on house floor amendment
number one to house taxation
revenue Committee substitute for
House Bill to ninety one is
adopted.
Generations almost you still
have a four I yield the floor
back to the gentleman from
Bernalillo Mr speaker the
gentleman from Bernalillo thank
you Mr speaker and with that we
are open for questions for most
of the gentleman from Lee
Representative Scott.
It's okay to defer to later in
the debate.
Okay and I'm told there's a
somewhat lengthy hand written
amendments on this bill I'm just
gonna advise members that you
know the hand written amendments
we can take them if they're
short that if it's modifying a
bill as long tax schedules and
things like that I.
The server plaques in my entire
time in the house I've never
seen maybe one hundred amendment
ever we're getting lots of them
the session it's it is not good
practice
so you know we can take it is it
comes that if there's any way
to.
if there's a way to do it I
that said we look having typed
up we'll go to the Jennifer
Sandoval Representative Harper.
Thank you Mr speaker does the.
Gentleman and classy chair from
taxed Rev Committee
you'll.
Speaker I yield to the gentleman
from seven to one.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman
I.
Very much appreciate so much of
this bill.
I think there's a lot sure.
to praise and what is to be done
actually a lot of this was in
the tax reform bill that I carry
several years ago and and
actually we had I think every
member of the tax committee as
co sponsors Republicans and
Democrats so there's there's
lots of good material here.
and so Mr speaker and gentleman
I'd like to have just the.
a friendly conversation back and
forth a lot of these issues I
think.
Our.
They'll be some issues in this
bill that we have philosophical
differences on.
but I think we can have a
disagreement without being
disagreeable and because respect
for each other come from.
So I'm I'm not review all of the
question from of the committee
but I I would like to bring up
several things just so that.
the the body understands I want
is to be done and and and what
this bill is doing.
So the the first time I'd like
to talk about is is winter so
low income comprehensive tax
rebate.
And and Mr speaker and gentleman
I believe you mentioned earlier
was a vice chair gentlelady from
Los Alamos National this really
was quite a place.
Try to a group of trusted
regressivity of gross receipts
tax.
in that we know that those with
less income.
they're hit by this tax harder.
as a percentage of their income
they see it when they Sarkozy's
taxes really most people still
want to go and purchase things
into sales tax kind of how we
see it so you can imagine those
folks on the lower income when
they go to purchase things that
gross receipts tax is it okay.
Personal income tax so that
gross receipts tax becomes a Big
Bird to that.
I'm so Mister speaker and
gentleman what did you say the
last time this was updated the
electric program speaking how
may was nineteen ninety eight.
Yes so it's much bigger and
gentleman yeah we're we're
talking more than twenty years
ago.
and and I well I I find ways
that I have we had a update to
this elector our program is part
of a house bill four twelve so
that's that's a great thing to
do.
you Mr children what what I
remember from the committee
hearing is that these numbers
are just picked out of Senator
either
do you recall how this update
was structured speaker John.
Mr speaker and gentleman I I was
in there ninety eight when they
did this but I've I believe I
believe they use the consumer
price index if I'm not mistaken.
Yeah so so correct Mr speaker
and gentleman when they first
put together a ninety eight.
They basically looked at how
much gross receipts tax that
expect people to pay Ms families
with lower income they both the
numbers around.
They also could have any
dependents and and it's tapered
off nicely as income grew.
So that's that's where it
started
this bill we're we're updating
it
Mr chairman.
My understanding is we look at
the
the rate of inflation between
ninety eight and now and we've
updated those numbers.
CENIC's perfect sense that's.
What was the right way to do it
I believe we also expanded a
little bit from the folks who
you know just of course income
also changes was inflation so we
kept it the same income level
that that would not be a true
adjustment so so I appreciate
that as well.
Mr chairman and then also in
this bill.
I'm in a elector section we are
talking about.
there is a annual inflation
index is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman that is
correct.
Yes so Mr Chairman
I can appreciate that if if we
had an inflation index
adjustments from the started in
ninety eight what have to be
carried this legislation right
now.
but I do just want to caution.
And and well there's always pros
and cons to these kinds of
things.
in general are appropriators you
know our our.
Finance appropriations finance
committee Senate finance
committee in general they try to
stay away from.
Are these kinds of inflation
adjusted indexes.
And there's a reason for that
and that is your you're
essentially locking in.
A reoccurring increased in
appropriation
In the statutes and that can be
a challenge because of.
Speaker and gentleman we have
taken a lot of those things out
of our tax base that adjust
naturally was inflation.
I'm talking about to
as an example.
And we also have things in our
budget that grow faster than the
rate of inflation I'm
specifically thinking about
health care costs Medicaid that
that's you know I six of our
budget in growing.
and also education costs
especially higher at
those costs increase much
greater than the rate inflation
we saw the same promise yet
lottery scholarship.
Mr chairman that
as the cost of tuition increase
much greater than inflation can
a point where the water is funds
themselves were not sufficient
to cover tuition and so we have
to make that call is are we
gonna strap that increased to
the general fund.
So Mr Chairman just a comment
there that I think we need to be
cautious and careful.
Especially when our.
State revenues aren't keeping up
with inflation that we're now
attaching.
Legislation indexed items to to
or.
R. for corporations or different
tax programs Mr John did you
have.
If you have any comment on that
like a talking for awhile.
Mr speaker and gentleman and
from from Santa no I mean it's I
think you you as usual is
usually you you bring some good
points to the table I don't I
don't specifically have any
comments to what you said you
know I I will I will agree with
your point though you know this
should be done in ninety eight
you know instead what's happened
is we have we have a a rebate
for you know the threshold of
which is pretty low
and it hasn't changed in in you
know more than twenty years
twenty one of twenty three years
here so I feel like it's
something we probably need to
do.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman from Bernalillo.
okay so let me go to the next
part of the bill and then the
nasco I have a comment to
correct these two together
because I think they're
important so the next is the
working families tax credit.
And the Mr chairman my
understanding is.
Right now because of house bill
six.
we match that seventeen percent
of what the federal.
Which has tax credit is.
That is correct Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman I believe this bill
takes up to twenty percent is
that correct I remember that
correctly speaker that is
correct.
Thank you Mr chairman and.
When you look at
These kinds of programs are
designed to help folks get off
their feet the working families
tax credit is is a good program
that way
it.
I believe it was initiated
during the Reagan
administration.
And and I.
I know that there is some degree
of
abuse you know some some
fraudulent
our case is there and since we
are Tax Court piggy back office
said it's we really don't have a
way to address that but still
it's no no programs perfect
right so
so in general I would say it's
it's a good program and I would
see that it's great because it
hurts people to work you know
and
and that's what we really want
these these programs that we
have our we're not.
You know none of us wants these
people just live off these
programs are turned away want
them to.
use this help together feet
maybe com um you know well
employed and and to have that
self worse that comes with
having a.
A good job really feel valued
and there be compensated well
for their contributions on that
that means so much
You know the folks we know it's
it's sector rising to to have to
be you know.
Are all these programs.
I don't know just to I think
updating it or bring up to
twenty percent could be a good
idea could be could not be a
good idea my.
And we talked a little bit about
this Mr speaker and gentleman in
the committee.
Are there are a lot of programs
out there and and I.
I I worry that we're not being
as data driven as we could be.
so for example
when I was in college I was are
you know newly married going to
New Mexico tech in Sapporo.
And we didn't have much income.
And so we qualified at that time
for section eight housing.
Which was super helpful.
we qualified
The for Medicaid
actually almost all of my wife's
pregnancy with her first son was
Medicaid cover I got my first
job right before
Does my second daughter was my
first job my my second to my
mind my daughter was our first
job so our first pregnancy was
Medicaid we had which.
which was super helpful.
we were not poor enough to
qualify for food stamps or snap.
and and at one point when I was
in graduate school at Purdue.
we got a little side and because
we were also to help with
teaching such.
And the statement actually
increased.
our it wasn't a big increase but
it actually was like true
dollars over the amount that
would allow us to qualify for
Medicaid.
and and so we're like oh my gosh
and we know this two dollars was
gonna break us and so I bring
this up because you know we talk
about the facts and these are
real right I I mention I have a.
A friend who is an employer in
had a had a wonderful lady who
is just a wonderful employee and
she came up to just last year
and said I'm sorry R. I have to
quit so I get one more paycheck
I lose my benefits.
I'm so speaker German I really
think we need to have a more
holistic approach to look at.
Which tennis Medicaid section
eight housing Webster
There's like three or four more
than just not remember off the
top of my head but making sure
we don't have as close affects
our donut holes for going into
speaker and gentleman so I guess
all of us your thoughts on that
and then ask for you know where
to this twenty percent number
come from thank you for being
perhaps a little bit more data
driven in the future as we look
at these programs.
Yes Mr speaker and gentleman of
those are great points and you
know to to that to that sort of
last last point you made you
know we we have
we have a working families tax
credit that is still lower you
know the the the national
average with other states I I
believe twenty nine of twenty
eight other states have an
equivalent I'm in the average
credit is twenty two percent and
for the you know for the longest
time we had it we had a sort of
capped at ten
we were able to negotiate an
increase of seventeen percent
two years ago and so simply what
we're doing now is going back to
that twenty percent that has
been pursued all along me quite
frankly perhaps you should be
closer to twenty two twenty
three maybe twenty five percent
but I think you know we have to
make a policy decision about
where to
you know where to draw the line
if you will you know with regard
to data I mean I you're
absolutely right in one thing
that we do know is that this
type of credit is is is good
because it encourages people to
work right got a you've got
wages in order to qualify for it
as you very eloquently
stated you know that this credit
has been around the federal
level for a long time I've heard
conflicting stories so I've
heard that it was president Ford
that put into law so.
Either way good idea you know
with with regard to to to data
in our tax policy look you and I
can disagree on the specific
policies we should pursue you
and I might even disagree with
regard to the philosophy of of
of of of tax policy but what we
will not disagree is is data and
you know most of this other bill
is is trying to roll back things
that we did twenty years ago
without any data right things
that we did twenty years ago
that folks promised us the
citizens of this great state you
know the the the moon in the sky
and everything in between and I
am of the opinion that we
haven't gone much fort and so
we've got to start scaling back
in the places where we just
don't know if something's
working and try to reinvest in
the places where we know it's
working you know again we know
the these are these are the low
wage workers that have kept the
lights on that have kept the
grocery store shelves stocked
these are the folks that over
the last twelve months have done
their best to to hold society
together in many ways and you
know I I think that twenty
percent is this fair and and
also don't forget the expansion
of this credit to families that
historically have been left out
of the credit simply because
they lack a social security
number at the time of filing the
taxes right nothing else is
different about them they have
kids at home they're low wage
workers they they do the work
there and they they aren't the
wages they file their taxes but
they can't do it with the social
security number and so they're
automatically a staff but I I
agree with you I think data is
important and you know I think
that
As as our careers progress here
is that slate you're you know
you're gonna we're gonna see a
lot more that.
Chairman and Mr speaker chairman
Jennifer well thank you for that
and yeah I I I completely agree
with you that know you and I
might differ a little bit on
policy but we we want to do the
right data processing
that might.
Yeah just just being completely
honest.
I just don't know what the right
number it's pretty generous tax
credit is it twenty percent is
it fifty percent is it thirteen
percent I just don't know.
what I really love and you know
maybe we'll get.
Some help or maybe I'll just
have to do it myself but I
really love to have a plot that
on one axis is income.
On the other access is how many
dependents you have when you
rotate it down like this when
you stack up in bars all the
different programs that they
qualify for we can look at kind
of this circus of different bars
to provide all works with the
fax.
And then use programs like
revise tax credit or elector to
make sure that we smooth those
things out.
because we should never be in a
position where a great employee
late on a great job just to go
to her boss you know go to
employer and say I'm sorry I
can't work anymore because if I
get a paycheck I'm gonna lose a
ton of money.
That's just.
When I agree.
Okay so so going on to the other
part of the bill which I
generally like
of the property tax issue.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo what.
My understanding is we are
looking at changing the the
three percent cap
valuations every year that
happens across all all
of residential property I
believe our lives also
commercial.
where we're changing that for
folks for for basically any
structure that is not a head of
household primary
home.
From three percent to ten
percent might my characterizing
that correctly Mr speaker yes
yes you are and if you don't
mind I'd like to yield to the
gentleman Santa Fe because this
is something that he's been
working very hard on of the last
few years and I'd like for him
to be able to respond to those
to those questions on section
five Mr speaker.
Thank you gentlemen gentleman
from Santa Fe just to be clear
it is only we're only addressing
residential properties it does
not affect.
Properties of all.
Mr chairman thank you for that
clarification yeah I.
I need to dust off the cobwebs
we spent during that time we're
drafting house bill
for twelve together we do have a
property tax component trying to
address Tax lightning.
and we look at what several
different approaches I think the
speaker even had an up and
approach at one time that I saw
was very interesting innovative.
But it was very interesting to
see
what I find when we presented
this bill.
The conversation was not about
tax lightning and how to fix it
the questions very much turned
into how much the legislature
different legislators don't like
there county assessors.
So so at that point I knew that
we were talking about success
I'm gonna stripping that out of
the bill as it progressed
speaker and gentleman could you
just share kind of the genesis
of this approach and and why the
ten percent number of how that
would Raval stains
could you share that with us
please.
Thank you Mr speaker gentleman
first let's let's talk about tax
lightning Tax lightning to me
isn't.
In into this is Billy clear
terms so we were talking about
tax lightning my understanding
at the term is the idea that any
given neighborhood with
comparable properties you could
have neighbors.
Paying will vastly different
amounts of property taxes one
neighbor has lived there for say
twenty or thirty years and other
neighbor has moved it and the
reason this happens under our
existing code is that we have
cap the valuation.
It can't increased more than
three percent a year.
In a lot of areas of our state
that's not a factor because
property values haven't risen
that quickly in some areas of
our state that is packed because
property values have risen
rapidly but have been
artificially kept low by this
three percent cap.
If you buy a property.
It goes to what we call current
and correct that is the full
evaluation and that's why you
get this what people call up tax
lightning so I think the idea is
someone moves into a
neighborhood they suffer from
tax lightning and they're paying
more taxes than their neighbor
but Mr speaker Tom and you know
that to me what what what this
bill is all about fairness and
you can certainly make the
argument that.
While the neighbor that's paying
more might not want to pay more
and might prefer to do the right
that their their neighbors there
for thirty years is paying
they're still paying the rates
on the current and correct value
of the house you know so it's
not it's not a penalty the way I
view it it's really as it should
be.
And what this what this
provision of this bill does is
it continues the policy of
protecting homeowners that we
want to protect homeowners we
don't want them to be priced out
of their homes because of taxes
so we keep that in place.
But we change the rule for
houses that are investments
residences that are a second
home or third home in some cases
in this area or vacation
properties because we don't
think those properties need the
same protection that a homeowner
should get.
So that Mr speaker and gentleman
from seven point thank you for
that
I think that's a great
Kind of snapshot of the
situation and speaker and
gentleman we're we're really not
addressing tax lightning in this
this bill I understand that.
we kind of have to different
conflicting.
Things that are going on right
so we have in our constitution
some actually pretty strong
language that says we we should
treat our property owners
differently.
Right I believe that's why this
three percent cap.
was no broadly
apply to lots of different
I will to everything essential.
the other thing is
that's kind of conflicting with
that is we have already
something in statute call you'll
control.
That kind of worry takes care of
mostly this prop
and I will for the the the
members was a lengthy
description you'll control but
it's it's a nice equation that's
an actual question statutes
back in the seventies really
have a great idea and just there
counties and school districts
are apply on revenue from
property taxes your property
values to this you know you
don't want their budgets to also
do this and so we brought this
formula said when housing values
go up it actually pushes down
the tax rate.
So that they're basically
getting about the same amount of
tax plus inflation.
And housing values go down
pushes the tax rate up so
basically again at about the
same on tax revenue plus
inflation so it's really a grant
system and I really think this
three percent cap
value value
She ation really hampered what
it's doing what was designed to
do.
And so I've been very much a
proponent of we need to slowly
unwind this mass.
the approach that I liked most
are several programs which
provide like most was that.
You would increase that cap from
three percent to seven percent.
And what that did was the
average increase in property
value in New Mexico is five
percent.
We get a two percent delta.
And over
it was about twenty years but
finally around which were
everything was true and correct.
And that means there's nowhere
Tax lightning also made it so
that we bought for when you're
looking at the total value of
property
in an area that would be
correct.
Mr Chairman
I.
I appreciate what's going on
here though even though it's not
the entire you know ball of wax
we are still looking at now
taking different parts of our
not property property here and
start moving it toward closer to
to
current and correct values so
much bigger and gentleman from
seven point.
What's that ten percent increase
how long do you our project will
take to get to a.
Current correct.
So Mister speaker German thanks
for the question obsolete you
and I have discussed that before
it it's it's first of the church
worth noting
you know there there are certain
to provisions in section five
one references the three percent
cap.
It's not region particularly
clearly it's written one hundred
and three percent the prior
value you know it's interesting
the way it needs to be written
and that is reserves for owner
occupied primary residences and
then we have the second
provision which seven hundred
three percent it's a hundred ten
percent in.
You know Mr chairman it's not
but it's not saying we're going
raise rates ten percent a year
it actually the provision was
put in there to protect people
who have been the beneficiary of
this cap for the last twenty
years so their their next job if
this bill passes will be only
ten percent and then it if their
property has doubled in value
they won't get any media hundred
percent hit rate so so this ten
percent is the soft landing
other was asked for it and I
think it seems reasonable in.
Information I have the Mr
speaker gentleman which is
information of course I got from
you Mr speaker John it is that
we think that will bring those
properties back to current and
correct valuation in about
seven.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes
thank you for that
And I believe that's I believe
it's still right off to.
Just off the excel spreadsheet I
think seven years about right.
And you know that that might be
a little fast you know if this
was drafted by me I might not go
all the way to ten percent but I
think seven percent is still or
seven years ten percent still
pretty decent soft landing.
The speaker John and what this
also apply to.
multi family homes slated
apartment buildings and that
kind of thing.
Mr speaker telling yes so the
the the residential nature of
property does include both
single family homes and
apartment buildings in the the
apartment buildings have been
the best history of this cap and
they would under this bill go
back to current and correct
based on the foundation.
Mr speaker and gentleman thank
you for that I just wanna make
sure we understood that and.
And yeah depending on how on how
much that value changes we might
expect right to go up in some
places
but there are also a lot of New
rental facilities that are
probably especially at current
correct already.
so we have to see what the
impact of that it's.
So so Mr speaker and gentleman
I really.
I think this is a step in the
right direction.
And and like C. R. what you're
and replace tax credit I.
I don't really have
Much arguments there part of
fire reforms are working
together I think the only
question I have is are you know
could be a little bit more data
driven.
so so this the sections of the
bill actually really liked.
R. speaker John and so I I guess
at this point I'd like to going
to the the last two sections
which I have a little bit of
disagreement with the the
chairman on but what what we'll
talk that through together.
you Mr speaker gentleman at this
point I I would yield back to
the chairman from a really
thank.
Okay so the the last two
sections of the bill.
we'll talk about the capital
gains deduction first.
Speaker and gentleman so what is
the.
It.
I'm alright hospital section and
after house bill six what what
is currently in statute capital
gains deduction.
Speaker John.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Santa it's forty percent or one
thousand dollars which everyone
is is higher.
Mr speaker German thank you for
that and and I believe before
house bill sixty years ago it
was at fifty percent.
it was just a reduction from
fifty percent to forty percent.
Us United speaker John it's on
permanent correctly.
So
What's before us is a proposal
to really
very much removal essentially
all the capital gains deduction
with the exception of when a
small New Mexico our business is
so speaker John is that is that
correct.
Yes Mr speaker element of the
that is correct and you know
part of the reason for that you
know as we go through these
legislative sessions and process
sees I remember when we were
debating house bill six on this
floor
we had a a similar.
what we had a similar provision
in that bill except that he
didn't take into account you
know those those small
businesses and I believe it was
you Mr speaker and gentleman who
actually brought that up and as
we drafted this bill we have the
you know as as I said the
beginning we've been trying to
be surgical and tactical and how
we do it right because we want
to ensure that there are no
unintended consequences and for
me that was an important piece
and you're right Mr speaker and
gentleman we have provided
is actually you know for lack of
better word exemption on capital
gains that are gained a capital
that is gained from the sale of
a business I'm not to exceed a
million dollars so you know I
believe the example you use Mr
speaker and gentleman two years
ago or so
which you stuck with me clearly
because it made it on to this
bill.
But it was this this idea of a
of a auto repair shop you know
as a mechanic who thirty years
ago open up the business and and
you know getting ready to retire
whatever and and sells his
business
under that previous proposal
house bill six you know all of
that capital gain would be
treated as just regular income
you know had had had that passed
and and you know have the Senate
changed it so we want to make
sure that we protect that
particular transaction also that
particular transaction can still
deduct up to forty percent so
that's not gonna change and you
know we we want to make sure
that that family business is is
is is not only treated fairly
but actually treated.
You know treated with with a
little bit more love if you will
by the tax system here in New
Mexico.
Mr speaker and gentleman for Lee
thank you for that I think you
described that really well
you know we we have lots of
small businesses that are really
family businesses.
And they.
Well maybe they have a four oh
one K. plan or whatever it's
called for us for business no
maybe they were saving for
retirement really at the end
when they saw that business
that's what I get that I miss
back.
So I I really want to I thank
you and applaud you chairman for
making sure that that portion is
still retained and in the
capital gains deduction.
Most most folks would capital
gains
who are aware of it right US
taxis right as like you know
some big giveaway to rich
traders and investment people
and you know maybe in other
states that's the case we don't
have many hedge funds and rich
people here in New Mexico.
the really the other kind of big
aspect of capital gains is again
these the smaller businesses
when they're doing their
business when it comes to you
know the so it quickly property
you know the discussing state
they also have I can realize
capital gains.
And so I just want to sort out
there that you know it's it's
not just the.
The fact that rich that we're
we're here this will this will
affect small businesses.
Another speaker John and.
If I remember yes are are
correctly we're looking at about
forty six million increase in
tax revenue from repealing this
provision is that correct.
Mr speaker and and gentleman
I've I believe you're you're
correct and you know part of the
reason why eight and I didn't
make this clear in my opening
but I'll take the opportunity to
do that now sure no we didn't
want to create and blow another
enormous tax tool you know
revenue hole in our general fund
and as important as it is to
ensure that working families and
low wage workers from the
receive a little bit of relief
you know the price tag is is FTE
it's not inexpensive you know
it's it's not cheap and so we
have to make sure that we could
balance the books if you will
and so to us looking at the
capital gains deduction and and
if you look you know what we
remember that we still keep the
the one thousand dollar you know
if if if you're if if if you're
a if you mess around the stock
market and you know you're
you're sort of just a regular
Joe a regular person regular one
here in New Mexico and make a
little bit of money off of
gamestop or whatever a thousand
dollars of that is already
automatically deduct.
I know you made a killing on
again so Mister speaker to.
Is.
Is also Mr chairman how did you
know.
Representative is perfect.
Yes but the you know
To me and then you're right we
don't have a ton of millionaires
in New Mexico we don't but we do
have you know people who earn
quite a bit more than than you
know the median income in New
Mexico you know folks who might
be trading stocks and bonds
maybe it's part of their
portfolio it's it's part of what
they do to to
sure there income and you know
that's the I think to me that's
the that's part of the tax code
that I believe then again you
know we I know we will we'll
disagree on this but I believe
that that was a big promise made
to us in two thousand three you
know that if we did this we
would attract a lot of those
high wage you know a high income
people to the state of New
Mexico and that they would take
that disposable income and
invested
and while I have no doubts that
in some cases that has probably
happened I don't think that we
can say
you know through a data driven
approach that this has resulted
in a great deal of benefit to
the state of New Mexico again
I'm not arguing that in some
situations there some examples
absolutely I agree there
probably are up but not to the
point where it's.
Benefiting I think
the state in in the ways in
which we part perhaps and hold
for you know so.
When you look at when you look
at.
And who benefits.
Mostly from this deduction it's
it's not the folks trading game
stop I'm on the weekend it's
it's people who who make quite a
bit of money off of it and you
know to me you know we're not
we're not asking for any type
of.
You know.
Special treatment the fact I
believe they're getting special
treatment now all right asking
is that it's counted as regular
income right counted up the
right that it's supposed to be
counted we're not taxing it at a
hundred percent or fifty percent
of anything like that this is a
deduction right so it's forty
percent it's like forty percent
of the whole all we're asking is
bring you back up to the five
and a half percent or the six
point two or the six point five
of the five point nine whatever
that might be.
That Mr leader gentleman yeah I
I so appreciate having these
discussions with your child.
There there's so much that we we
agree on and I appreciate your
your thoughts on that side.
Yeah I think.
We're we're I have a little bit
faster this is knowing that you
know are are small businesses
are struggling right now.
And and also not wanting to look
like it an outline.
Amongst other states.
I'll agree with you this is the
I never heard the promises
promises made that by making
this capital gains deduction we
have a bunch of rich people
moving to New Mexico yeah there
there's probably a few.
but we didn't have a time right
yeah I would very much look at
our tax code not as.
We have to do this and that to
attract businesses here but if
we have a good bass Tax Code.
That that will encourage
businesses here to to grow that
we're encouraging people here to
to take a risk and start a
business and when people look
around for where to go to set up
their business across the US
our tax code will be a red flag.
That's what I'm really looking
for here and I thank you Mr
speaker and gentleman from
really I haven't mentioned
earlier that I have a lot of
respect for you talk text what
you taught us.
when when you guys will remember
that Mr speaker and gentleman
when Tesla was looking around
for where to go there their new
battery plant and they were they
were shopping all the states.
Right and and you know her is
owner and that the California
they're all make its we offer
deals and even New Mexico to as
the Mexico's on the west.
and I was not happy we are on
the list
but
Utah
State there are the what's the
basis said
That's great we appreciate you
thinking about us but we've got
a we've got a good tax code and
if you wanna come you talk from
Utah we're not to give you a
sweetheart.
Then I just have so much respect
for that.
so I I I do worry that by
removing the seduction you know
we're we're gonna have a big
outlooks of people right but
it's just another thing that
makes us look a little bit more
like.
But I do very much appreciate
speaker and gentleman that you
lost a provision for New Mexico
on small businesses Mr chairman
I also really appreciate the
amendment as well the questions
are rotten Committee was this
could violate the Commerce
Clause
the US constitution Commerce
losses and we can't treat a
taxpayer in New Mexico
different then the tax payer in
our state.
And the way this was originally
drafted was very much only New
Mexico owned businesses qualify
for this and I was trying to
think how can we see you know.
Accomplish what we want to
without violating the Commerce
Clause and end up losing a bunch
of revenue that you're counting
on right.
I'm so I I.
I like the amendment I think it
takes care of all to do some
more digging on it but I want to
thank you for your department
for taking the time to work on
that in between the two million
for.
All right so Mister chairman all
I have just one section of to
talk about North Dakota gonna
times here and I I apologize but
I just really want to kind of
dive deeply into this and I hope
I hope these comments and the
discussion back and forth have
been helpful to folks.
the the last provision of the
bill is changes to the income
tax.
and this is in addition to what
we changed our two years ago
house bill six.
this gentleman can you just
maybe for what's to be married.
Filing joint can you just talk
about what the new brackets and
income cut offs will be.
Yes Mr speaker element thank you
for that question and and just
refresh our memories and in two
thousand nineteen.
I don't remember what was that
came out of the house but what
we ended up with after the
Senate voted on it and sent to
the governor it was a five point
nine percent and and there is
some triggers that we put in
regarding the oil and gas
revenues and the.
I believe it was the tax
stabilization fund as well.
to ensure that money
you know money was flowing there
before this thing again so it
was it was it was a five point
nine two four joint filers at
three hundred fifteen thousand
and above but if if for for
married individuals join joining
filing jointly.
if you're just as an example
income over twenty four thousand
but not over two hundred
thousand you're at the four
point nine percent right the
foregoing Act The four point
nine percent rate is what was
instituted back in after two
thousand three which by way of a
reminder for the body and you
can actually Google this there's
there's a fantastic Albuquerque
journal article and I'm I'm
pretty sure he was either on
Valentine's day two thousand
three or write about Valentine's
day two thousand three in the
then governor said we are
delivering the biggest
Valentine's day gift to the
people of New Mexico
and he essentially created a
flat in a flat income tax rate
right if you're making twenty
four thousand a year you're
paying four point ninety for
making.
you know.
Five hundred fifty thousand
you're paying four point nine.
in two thousand nineteen like I
said we we begin to change that
this bill if you're over twenty
four thousand but not over two
hundred thousand here at the
four point nine if you're at two
hundred thousand but not over
three hundred and fifteen
thousand here at one of the new
brackets five and a half now
keep in mind if you make two
hundred and ten thousand
dollars.
Only those additional ten
thousand dollars are taxed at
the new bracket the first two
hundred thousand are taxed at
the four point nine.
More in this but that excess is
what's tax that the new bracket
if you are over three hundred
and fifteen thousand but not
well over four hundred fifteen
thousand you're at that five
point nine percent bracket from
two years ago if you're over
four hundred and fifteen
thousand but not over six
hundred and twenty two thousand
you're at the six point two
percent right and if you over
six hundred and twenty two
thousand and quite frankly I can
at some point the high speed
state employee was the football
coach at UNM TV and I think he
was at about seven fifty I
remember correctly I don't know
what any of the coaches make now
Avenue follow that but if you're
over six hundred and twenty two
thousand dollars you're at six
and a half percent in the axis
of the six twenty two remember
the access right
much much lower than the I think
it was eight and a half percent
prior to two thousand three
right that was the highest tax
free tax rate in half percent
more less back in two thousand
three so you know we're still
not even close to what used to
be and quite frankly you know I
think it's part of the reason
why is is you know most states
around us have moved in a
different direction you know we
know what we know Arizona now is
kind of moving back I think they
have a a top tax rate of about
eight percent that thing now so
they'll be the out liar even
after even if this is passed and
signed by the governor but
that's that's just an example
for you and and and the body to
really understand how these tax
brackets work right one last
thing before I go back to
Florida speaker gentleman this
is taxable income so you've
already taking your deductions
right if you're at two hundred
thousand dollars.
That's not what you made you
made more than that you know
maybe maybe two twenty five or
two forty or two fifty and then
you took all your deductions and
then your taxable income when
was all said and done was two
hundred thousand dollars for a a
merry fighting jointly and
you're still at the four point
nine percent under this bill.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo thank you what love
those comments and I and I
specially love what you did
making us all think that
football coaches should pay more
tax that was really it.
the speaker and gentleman.
Yes so.
C..
Yeah prior to house bill six our
Max tax bracket was four point
nine percent.
And when I first came to the
legislature you know nine years
ago I thought that was a really
we're not just I.
right and what I found was that
but we actually did was we took
the average top bracket of all
of our states in this
neighboring region.
And we look at that average the
number was four point nine
percent that's what we did.
And I love that because I really
believe
you know this was far right
Republican right and I I really
believe that in a state with the
economy the size we have it's a
point not be an outline.
The higher or lower rate people
are protected in our low in your
sphere Mr speaker John.
About everyone moving to Mexico
because we have a property tax.
Right.
Our gross receipts tax and
awareness Hyatt's however what
are we do hear about people
saying that we don't like
Mexico's gross receipts tax sort
order consider right.
so I I really believe middle of
the pack is where we want to be.
so just looking around the
states right now I appreciate
you Representative altogether is
only the second.
So Utah has a flat tax of four
point nine five percent.
Colorado has a flat tax of four
point five five percent.
Oklahoma well.
They don't have a flat tax with
a top rectus five percent.
Texas doesn't have an income tax
but they were really high
property taxes how they they
make up for those lost dollars
from income.
Arizona as you mentioned is yeah
wire now their top rock is eight
percent and that's a recent
change but
I think this is a big deal.
that bracket checks in at five
hundred thousand or more
dollars.
The staff bracket is a four
point five percent bracket.
metrics in its three hundred and
twenty seven thousand dollars.
So.
Even though they have a higher
brackets and and we do point
eight versus the six point five
proposed here.
it's not going to hit the middle
class like this change R. we'll
hear.
And I guess the other point I
mentioned that all you know we
love to hear your response.
What a lot of folks didn't don't
know and I don't know when I
first started this is that
in personal income tax is where
nearly almost every business in
the state pays their taxes.
we have a very little bit of
corporate income tax and that's
that's true for every state you
don't see one state you with
more than five percent of
revenue coming from corporate
objects.
The vast majority of it comes to
personal income tax because
you're hello sees your your your
past you introduce your in all
partnerships what they do is
their business.
revenue is passed on to the
individual and the individual
files taxed as personal income
tax.
So when you look at all of the
person tax revenue that we get
your well we must have a lot of
individuals that your making
decent money and what but what I
think we just filled understand
is those are all of our small
business.
and we wanted to grow we want to
hire you want to introduce.
so Mister speaker John and I I
do worry that now going from
four point nine a couple years
ago up to five point six.
Who are really hurting is
small businesses small employers
of doctors
Lawyers although I think I
mentioned a committee we might
not care so much about lawyers
paying more
but you know we keep talking
about how hard it is to attract
doctors rural New Mexico and
hello challenges for the small
businesses to to scare flow
right now I guess my question
is.
Why why are we doing this now
should we be waiting
Tell you know we're we're
recovered from COVID and and
your counties tech back up and
we're not trying to send a bunch
of money to small businesses we
don't shut their doors
Why do you feel like now is the
right time this speaker John R..
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman from San Juan those
are fantastic points and I I I
want to go back real quick to to
to something you said earlier
about about Tesla because I
remember
I think that was before my time
in the legislature might have
been right around that time I
think it was twenty twelve or
thirteen that is not that all
and and I remember
you know a lot of people on my
side of the sort of political
philosophical Lyle what we're
really excited of a sudden
because here's yes not right
electric car
building a factory in New Mexico
and I remember feeling a little
bit.
Uncomfortable but
because what I saw was as you
the phrase that you use shopping
around right and I saw the is
this.
This race to the bottom.
to see who could give us the
most to this private company to
move into the state in exchange
for for a few jobs and perhaps
well paid jobs and perhaps a
great project but needless to
say right and and I feel the
same way whether it was our
competition for the Amazon
headquarters or you know quite
frankly even the space for
Stanley at just the certain
things just don't match up right
if you want to come to my house.
And.
You know eat my food and hang
out with my family and enjoy my
backyard and hang out with my
dogs and watch the game with us.
You need to do so because you
want to you need to do so
because you appreciate us you
want to do so because you like
the way I grill you like what
you've got on is right I
shouldn't have to pay your.
Those
the manager Paul and I get it I
mean it's economic development
and and you know the the
economic developers will will
use their that whatever tools at
their disposal to do what they
need to do I don't I don't
begrudge it I think they have
very difficult work.
But.
When we look at income tax rates
right we look at these
neighboring states and and
you're right you know you it
Texas has no income tax we all
know that
of course they have a much
higher property taxes it's it's
sort of a give and take I think
I think I think you mentioned
you tied so little you know a
little under five I think
Oklahoma's I maybe if I remember
correctly Colorado's of the
lender I up what we're doing
here is so I need to to get to
the first point you made right
because I I too wondered about
these rates I was like what he's
at six point two weighs in at
six
and as we were drafting the bill
and and working with the with
the
the the bill drafters and and
the advocates and other folks
yeah we wanted to create sort of
a bit of a step ladder right and
sort of find enough space so
that you have a more smooth
latter not so steep quite
frankly should be five point six
or five point five yeah you know
five point seven or five point
four yeah I mean give or take
your pride to any of those
but that's sort of the reason
how we landed on those on those
specific numbers now.
Why now the question of why do
we want to do it now.
and and and I think that that is
sort of the crux of your
comments and questions and and
probably the the the question
everybody's money.
We are in the middle of in
unprecedented pandemic neither
you nor I have ever seen it
although you've seen this in a
sort of micro level you know
you're working Africa with the
ball I think kinda I I don't
know I will have to have a a
glass of milk I was gonna say
bureau we're gonna have to have
the.
And I'll be curious to hear the
actual story of you being in
these villages in dealing with
this terrible disease which is
like a.
Cousin of coronavirus read COVID
nineteen.
We are living through this
present pandemic a hundred years
in the making.
and what we've seen in New
Mexico is something that I never
thought I would see I New Mexico
had its share of problems I know
that New Mexico has a very long
history
you know pre statehood a history
that lives with us every single
day you see the history every
single time you walk out of your
house
Mr speaker gentleman when you
when you drive to work from
we are ranchers and the up the
drive through my old
neighborhood the international
district
which you know.
The name was changed a few years
ago but we used to call it
something else.
You speak to this date you see
the.
You see the the the.
The outcome of the divestment
you see what happens when
communities are sort of left
alone and and completely
neglected by the private sector
and the public sector.
The pandemic revealed.
Inequities that were
unimaginable today
I never realize that our
brothers and sisters.
On the western part of the state
Navajo Nation in the towns
bordering it.
We hit so hard by this pandemic
you know folks who don't have
running water folks who don't
have
access to.
Food as freely as some of us
might have.
This is not just out there it's
it's down in the southern the
southern border you know the
colonias you know communities
from you know while to to to
talk but I love to see at two
places in between communities
that also have been divested
from both by the public and the
private sector
So as we work through this
session and as we.
Collectively work together to
provide whether it's COVID ready
for small business that would
G. R. T. tax holiday for a
quarter whether it's small small
business loans or grants
you know whether it's liquor
license reform whatever it might
be read every single thing that
we're doing to address the
economic impact of COVID on so
many New Mexicans up to me.
Working on this tax code and
changing the way we treat
whether it's capital gains
income or whether it's
a personal income at the highest
levels in order to re invest in
the same communities right
reinvesting through increases
elector and hopefully from now
on victory will will always rise
right with with with inflation
our working families tax credit
right increasing much we're
going from seventeen to twenty
right so whole lot but it's a
little bump the peace almost
excited about is getting our
brothers and sisters who don't
have a social security number to
be able to qualify for this
credit because you're working
and paying taxes just like you
and me
to me.
It would have been irresponsible
on our part too low eight fifty
plus million dollar hole in the
budget.
To give much needed relief and
much the surgery Lee we have to
find a way to balance a
checkbook and so for me looking
at these tax rates looking at
those highest earners and doing
it in a very respectful and
graduate remember you can still
make two hundred and ninety nine
thousand dollars.
You're only taxed at the higher
bracket for those last nine nine
thousand not for the entire year
over year income that's
important to note
Lastly you Mr speaker.
And
and gentleman you know when we
look at middle class families in
New Mexico
you know it just sort of looking
through my notes here
and as as you were as you were
talking I I looked up a couple
of reports I had in my file
it's ninety six thousand dollars
as what would be considered
middle class in New Mexico
ninety six thousand dollars for
household.
that ninety six thousand dollars
is still tax of the four point
eight percent right they're not
even close.
To getting hit with a tax hike
right the ones that are going to
get hit and even even the word
hit is probably not accurate
they're gonna have a gradual
bump in their tax rate our
people who make a lot more than
ninety six thousand dollars for
household
and then lastly Mr chairman you
bring up a great point about
small businesses and this is
small business I think it's
something that we all will agree
is is important all of us I
don't think there's one of these
legislature who who doesn't want
to fight for the little guy.
Over the course of the last
twelve months many of those
small business have been
hurting.
If you're small business has not
been in operation.
If you're not earning an income
then these tax brackets are not
going to mean anything to you it
doesn't matter right when you
file your income taxes a sole
proprietor at the end of the
year your you know if you use to
make four hundred and fifty
thousand dollars here you're not
gonna you're not gonna make that
sadly right
Now once you're up and running
and once you're on all eight
cylinders and you've got
customers in your selling and
you're producing and you're
doing what you're doing.
Then there seek new tax bracket
that you might and and I I I I
emphasize the word might.
You might graduate to.
In like a year to when you file
the taxes after your business up
and running again right at this
rate we don't expect.
A
you know I I still report
yesterday
president
President by in orbit or maybe
was why have somebody said that
by the end of may maybe maybe
every American would be
vaccinated.
That's amazing I hope so and I
hope that come summertime we can
all go and hang out of breweries
and coffee shops and slide down
the most K. few here in
Albuquerque and hit up all the
great food spots that we having
congregating be together again
and hopefully that second half
of twenty twenty one
will be.
Will be magical in these
businesses will will re emerge.
And assuming they go over.
Those income limits they'll pay
a little bit more income tax
only on the amount that they
went over by right so to me this
is important and it is something
that we can do in a way that
does not break the bank if you
will it doesn't put a whole lot
of weight on these folks who are
earning these amounts of money
it's gradual it's little by
little and the difference is
that those extra three or four
hundred Bucks are going to make
in that working families pocket
at the end of the year it's huge
I guarantee you it is huge
sorry for the lengthy answer to
your to your thoughtful
thoughtful comments Mr speaker
and gentleman.
Now Mr chairman up no no
apologies necessary I I
appreciate these discussions
that we have we can do it in a
cordial friendly way.
And I think I agree with.
Maybe half of what you what you
said I think we're a this is
where we might start diverging a
little bit on on our on our
beliefs and and the ones that we
see the world and
I I do agree that these extra
couple hundred dollars to make a
huge difference in these
people's hands
I will just remind the body that
these folks how many many
benefits that have been put in
place by this legislature over
the decades.
and and I'm just just a quick
example you know we had a
nursing young study of our tax
code.
we weren't there's a great plot
that shows
low income people actually play
pay negative income tax when you
account for all the credits and
things they they get paid money
back to that.
I'm just not until their
adjusted gross income so after
deductions right to twenty four
thousand deductions not alert
adjusted income reaches around
twenty five or thirty five
thousand at the begins to start
paying point one percent income
tax.
So so yes this these programs to
be what is the updated I'm not
sure what to tell us working
families tax credit you know the
second fifty percent of a
certain percent yes this will
help.
not a state if the bill only was
those first three parts of Mr
speaker and gentleman it was
just what directed toward by tax
credit and in the property tax
changes I would be voting for
this bill
those are good changes.
but I am very concerned about.
The other two changes in in my
mind it's just we're.
We're kind of getting mixed
messages
to small businesses right were
were.
We're giving out money to try to
keep them alive right now and I
believe the masses only about
five percent of small businesses
will be able to use that money.
so we're working or trying to
step on the gas to help them out
that here I see this as note
also slamming it on the break it
the same time especially when
you include.
All of the other legislation so
which is a request for that
we're moving out I just.
We worry what kind of messages
were given to our for small
employers.
Our doctors and folks and and
even you know to teachers the
average teacher next.
Sixty five thousand so to
teacher also is now making a
hundred thirty.
I just I really worry that.
we are doing something here that
makes us look more like an out
wire is mixed messages to our
small businesses and
just totally how just say I
personal three people that
decided to move and and to pick
up their their dental practice
or small businesses go elsewhere
because additional for welcome.
I know it's not your tent Mr
speaker John at the end I I know
that.
but but I worry that that is the
unintended message we're
sending.
so Mr Chairman artist I ask you
this in committee notice just
this one last time and all of
you before I'm.
Is there not another way to pass
these first three items would
not open up a little room in the
in the budget and and then do
these three good things.
and not make these other changes
to the tax code.
The speaker gentleman
you want me to change my answer
from committee I know you're
you're you're.
Yeah you know I I I I see where
you're coming from and and I and
I get you and and look I I think
I I I know a couple of of couple
families that have that have
left
yeah I I can see and and they
were both
professional families one of
them have sort of a consulting
business and any of the other
one I work in a private practice
but neither of those families
left because they feel that
taxes were out of control in
fact they left because of some
of the societal issues we're
dealing with whether it's you
know Education issues or or
public safety issues right sort
of going back to my to my
comments from earlier that that
generational trauma that that
we're still dealing with right
when we look at income just as
an example look at income tax
rates by state we have four
point nine four point five and
five zero and whatever else is
in Arizona
but our community our population
is very different and and I have
to stress that because as we
look at these numbers we cannot
look at these numbers
in the abstract right I mean
absolutely I was going to move
somewhere I would look at that
map and say I'm going to go
wherever there's a zero next
personal income tax and I would
move there if that's all you
wanted or cared about right
but that's works right in in a
place like New Mexico again
where there's been so much
divestment public view from the
public sector the private sector
over the last many years and
where we see the results of that
divestment in our in our you
know in a public safety issues
right in our in our.
drug use disorder issues
incarceration rates the lack of
opportunity that exists in many
of our communities I believe
that calls for investments
if we were to pull this money
out of the general fund to pay
for these.
Tax credits in in rebates the
during working families tax
credit we would be blowing a
fifty plus maybe more I think
it's actually more than maybe
closer to seventy million dollar
hole in the budget that's money
that we have we have to take
away from early childhood money
that we have to take away from
K. twelve money that we have to
take away from things like
Medicaid or things like
behavioral health and whatnot
so well I appreciate the the
sentiment right like if if there
is a way to do it absolutely I
would be I would be all about it
but I think that blowing a
seventy plus million dollar hole
in the budget could be a real
problem at that this that this
this right so you know my my
response remains the same as
Monday.
The answer is of the good try Mr
speaker and gentleman from the
one.
Thank you Mr speaker and and
John from Bernalillo I I very
much enjoyed this discussion
with you.
And I I very much enjoy this
awfully that to you approach tax
policy.
And the and and and I
I sincerely
said that I I I can't go for
this this legislation but to
thank you very much for the time
Mr speaker on.
Thank you gentlemen.
There's further debate the
gentleman from Dona Ana
Representative small.
Thank you very much madam
speaker Madam speaker and
gentleman which you you.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
Diana that.
Thank you so much thank you
madam speaker thank you
gentlemen really deeply enjoying
tonight's debate and really
substantive discussion around a
number of different policy
issues and want to ask a few
questions Mr speaker and
gentleman
I think maybe one thing I could
just pick up off of with you and
and the previous the gentleman
from some of all
D. E. Mr speaker gentleman it
sounded to me like you with the
agreement in some of these
increasing the elector
increasing the working families
tax credit.
Would you say that looking to
find those budgetary offsets to
find a way to not As You
profitable hole in the budget
would you say that's just kind
of of a responsible approach to
kind of the the inevitable trade
offs in challenges that we we
all face collectively.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
going on up yes I mean I I do
think it's a responsible
approach to.
To expanding.
These types of of of of tax
incentives or benefits whatever
one column tax code you know one
of the things that
That the gentleman from Santa Fe
mentioned a little bit in his
opening remarks was no Sir of
the.
that the.
The complexity of the tax code
Tax Court as it is right like we
have a pretty aggressive G. R.
T. you know decisions have been
made that predate I think any of
us really for the most part
decisions that I think really
have perhaps at the time they
were made
you know they were made with
with some expectations of
strength a property whether it's
the two thousand three income
tax cut in the capital gains
deduction
or whether it's any of the gross
receipts tax credits actions and
exemptions that we build books
up but so much of that happened
Mr speaker and gentleman from
the lineup
without offsetting cost.
Right and somebody mentioned
that this
in I think you might have been
on the Senate side I think I was
I think it was watching Senate
floor debate.
I do have committee yesterday I
was bored so I was watching a
little Senate floor debate and
one of the senators described
you know the G. R. T. system as
having turned into a Christmas
tree of Gipps right for for a
period of time years ago as you
know Mr speaker and gentleman
We don't really do that anymore
what we're actually really good
about those things and out my
legislative memory and Tax
Policy can only go back to
twenty fifteen with with
I'm chairman Harper
and the ways and means committee
but I'm proud that every single
session since I've been here at
the tax committee has passed any
type of incentive board or
credit or deduction or exemption
or or or tax benefit
up we've always figured out a
way to pay for it and you in
your role on the house
appropriations and finance
committee with speaker John that
know better than most how
important it is for that
coordination to happen not only
between the committees and the
staff and the Legisla- forced to
figure out what kind of capacity
can be built in year to year
based on your projections and
the good work of the LFC up but
how important is that we remain
responsible with regard to how
we do these things right up
something is being is this right
when you have a.
like I say a you know more or
less
seven that seventy million and
and I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna look
up the FIR just make sure I'm
saying that right but
you know it's it's if you look
at if you look at literature
it's costing us about twenty two
million fifty two million and
when you look at the working
families tax credits about
twenty two million in the out
years so it is roughly seventy
seventy five million dollars
it would be very tough I think
for us to be able to absorb that
kind of hit
particularly because it's
recurring revenue right this is
not a one time expense we're not
building a road we're not
building a school we're not
paying for broadband it's not a
capital project this is
something that's been we're on
the hook for.
For now on especially with
Victor because it's index you
know as as a chair at is is is
your friends on the violin
eloquently stated you know over
time that's going to eight
little bit more every single
year so to me Mr speaker and
gentleman this would not have
been possible to to have been
able to propose this
this type of twelve and
benefiting working people
working families without finding
a way to pay for it to me that
was critically important and I
just I just cannot think of a
scenario we could have done it
without paying for it.
Mr speaker and gentleman thank
you so much thank you for that
yeah and nuance and server I so
appreciate the fact that in in
the first conversation you had
this evening saying the value
and the benefits of Lichter and
the working families tax credit
and then being able to continue
on this conversation really a
knowledge in the challenging
checks and balances that we all
face as a body and and and your
focus Mr chair excuse me Mister
speaker gentleman Mr Chairman
your focus on on that
responsible step forward I know
you in the gentleman had a had a
discussion earlier
that the state of Arizona in a
by a vote of the entire of their
people by referendum added
substantially to their tax rate
Mr speaker or excuse me I
apologize madam speaker
gentleman they added
significantly more to their top
tax rate than you're proposing
with this legislation here today
is that right.
Mr speaker and gentleman that
that is correct I I believe the
top rate is now eight percent
and thank you for pointing that
out it was it was voted on by
the people thank thank you Mr
speaker thank you gentlemen I
think what we're hearing from
you again we the product
knowledge ment of the budget and
and the the stories about how
these targeted approaches with
the working families tax credit
or with low income with elector
the gentle lady the the really
innovative work that the
gentleman from Santa Fe one of
your co sponsors discussed these
are helping move New Mexico in
the right direction and we're
just working to make sure that
that's done in a responsible
manner Mr speaker gentleman it
kind of reminds me you know our
budget this year Mr speaker
gentleman
it was a real just a little bit
over a two percent increase
little over four but when you
accounted for the federal swaps
that we had to make last year
and special session it was
actually a very modest budget
increase obviously we saw wide
support on on this floor in this
body for at Mr speaker gentleman
can you remind all of us in
addition to the pandemic one of
the reasons that we actually had
to come into that special
session.
Mr speaker and and element you
know we we had a.
We had a.
Oil and gas market sort of
fallout at the bottom fell out I
think for a while the
it was trading at native native
dollars you could have made a
box if you want to take some oil
off of oil companies and that
was a big that's another big
part of reason we have to come
in we know we the the the
economy tents and then thank the
the global economy our state
economy as as reliant as it is
on the oil and gas industry
and because of those two sort of
pressure points you know our our
own professionals our own budget
professionals with the LFC and
the DFA we're ringing the alarm
it's it was very scary times we
had to come in in June.
Our with the good work of of the
chairwoman of of HFC and
yourself and your committee
members and three year
leadership we were able to come
up with a plan to ensure to the
greatest extent possible we
manage to balance the books with
our.
This traffic cuts to critical
services and programs in New
Mexico but the particularly at a
a time a little pandemic I mean
when you think of those two
factors coming together and and
sort of in retrospect it was
very scary right I mean what
what where the choice is going
to be.
Guiding the Medicaid budget.
At a time of a global pandemic
the health reduce dinner when
people are out of work is that
the time you want to kick off
thousands of people off Medicaid
you know school you know even
though kids are not in the
classroom learning they are
still there are still learning
they're still in school
they are doing it like this but
they're still they're there so
expenses associated and you know
I I would I would suspect that
the expenses are are you still
there the same as before they
might be a little bit more
because we have to figure out
how to get by is in the hands of
families we have to figure out
how to get internet to families
we've had to figure out how to
equip our educators with the
tools that they need to be able
to find.
The
you know the the the the
learning opportunities at the
need for for children so you
know when we look at this bill
and when you look at the way we
balance if and not only do we
balance it I mean we have a
little bit of money left over I
think on average is about five
million dollars to the general
fund all that good folks like
yourself and members of your
committee can can invest in in
critical areas of our economy
but you know it's it's
imperative it is imperative you
Mr speaker Madam speaker and
gentleman that we are that we
hold
our general fund as important
this is possible as we do in the
state one last point Mr speaker
and gentleman you know as we
I'll mention
my comments you know when oil
and gas prices bottomed out
and it being such a important
piece of our economy
this is this is another attempt.
This is another way another tool
in the toolbox as they say
up to diversify that economy to
diversify those revenue streams
that come in to our general fund
so that we don't continue to be
to be so overly reliant on any
one industry Madam speaker and
gentleman.
Madam speaker gentleman thank
you so much for that I
definitely and I'm I'm excited
to further our conversation
talking specifically about the
importance of the oil and gas
industry looking a little bit as
you said this most recent price
shock talking a little bit about
that going back.
Radiating certainly my time in
this body but I do I definitely
want to Mr speaker gentleman
really hold up what you said and
again from this perspective in
challenging times working to
make the most responsible
decision possible last year in
the special session.
You're exactly right we face a
scenario where there were
suggestions of.
Far more significant longer
lasting and deeper changes rate
cuts to our budget that that I
think ultimately you know
collectively we as a body chose
not to make but those could have
been things maybe not kicking
people off Medicaid rolls but
maybe Mr speaker gentleman
cutting the reimbursement rates
for doctors and clinics and
hospitals who were the very
epicenter of this pandemic COVID
nineteen health school boards
and the surge on services that
they face we we could at we
would have to cut the services
we could have Mister speaker
John as you talked about
not only pull back some of the
rate increases that had been
budgeted but actually there are
you know folks talking about
laying off teachers which would
have only compounded the effects
in our communities so I think
you know we were fortunate to
through great work in this body
strong leadership as well as
very significant federal support
chart of course that saw us
avoid those worst case scenarios
and to be in a position as we as
we work to reopen in creating
this blueprint to be able to
make these substantial important
investments Mr speaker German
briefly I want to go back to a
time and I'll just make a couple
of quick comments here.
I want to go back to a time
where the body did not have some
of those choices and as you know
Mr speaker gentleman I now I can
tell you within at least the
last I I our with the the WTI
that is the West Texas
intermediate price of oil was Mr
speaker and gentleman I'm sure
the body will be excited to know
that right now that WTI prices
actually over sixty one dollars
and we know of that in New
Mexico thanks for graft.
You know four to six dollar
deduction on that price but
we're still in a solid place
when it comes to both the price
of oil and we know our volumes
of oil Mr speaker gentleman we
just got the numbers and for
December according to the energy
information administration and
we produced over thirty three
million barrels of oil in in the
month of December which is just
extraordinary and
extraordinarily important to our
state and and we are so deeply
grateful for it Mr speaker
gentleman you can go back and
you can look at the price of oil
the the average price The New
Mexico receives per barrel of
oil and course also for natural
gas you can also go back and
look at the volumes a quick look
at the volumes Mr speaker
gentleman it tells us that we
are in unprecedented territory
for production December twenty
twenty Mr speaker and gentleman
and body get over thirty three
million barrels of oil.
One year prior to that thirty
million five hundred seventy one
thousand barrels your before
that twenty five thousand
and you go all the way back into
the beginning of the Great
Recession two thousand seven two
thousand and eight it's in the
five million barrels of oil and
it was at that point Mr speaker
gentleman.
Where in
March well it's a we'll take a
January of two thousand and
eight Mr speaker gentleman the
price of oil was ninety dollars
and eight cents a barrel that's
the price that New Mexico
received again according to the
energy information
administration two thousand nine
Mr speaker gentleman that price
plummeted to thirty five dollars
and twenty two cents a barrel
Mr speaker gentleman while I was
in serving in the legislature
during that time that ushered in
what's we now I think
collectively and really crossed
partisan the look back on is New
Mexico's lost decade Mr speaker
gentleman is it accurate to say
that that decade we didn't get
back up to full employment from
that two thousand eight level
until really you know in the
last year so before the
pandemic.
Mr speaker and gentleman first
of all thank you for for
for the insight on on that I I I
really appreciate the way you
follow the oil and gas economy
relates to New Mexico I think
that's that's an important thing
best way takes you on the daily
to get my my knees
I mentioned this to committee
you Mr speaker Madam speaker I'm
sorry madam speaker and New York
for the number I mentioned this
on Monday that New Mexico
experienced a lost decade right
and and between twenty twenty
ten
this remember that the recession
of a wait didn't really hit us
for like a year and a half or
two right we were sort of like
behind that Kerr
and you know I'm not sure why
that is but that's how it
happened and so beginning in
about twenty ten is when we
started feeling.
and we.
As policy makers and clearly
this is before our times but we
as policymakers both legislature
and and the then governor made a
series of policy decisions right
and you know one of those policy
decisions was to
you know what some might refer
is a guiding how the behavior
health system.
a system that in a place like
New Mexico is create critically
important.
That was a system that already
was hanging by a thread he was a
system that as a policy of the
the executive we decided to
essentially do away with it and
we're still trying to rebuild it
the immediate impact of doing
that
of the social impact of doing
that was felt all across the
state but I can tell you is
particularly felt in my hometown
are we've seen increases in
people living
living on the streets we have
seen a great deal of suffering
of families who we're dealing
with drug use disorders mental
health trauma
poverty that converged and then
that therapists that lifeline
was all of a sudden taken away.
Add to that I believe Mr Madam
speaker and gentleman a series
of of of policy decisions.
economic and otherwise that I
think really
but I think we really failed to
really
Yes.
This is that we were in.
so I think back to the twenty
thirteen to expect.
Right again another example of a
tax package that was passed
very similar to the two thousand
three tax package.
and while it has some really
good things in it right I mean
that's this this text is always
make me nervous because at the
end of the Hey there's a bunch
of stuff like it is put in
and then everybody scrambling at
the eleventh hour to figure out
what it is I'm proud that my
bill is only twenty twenty four
pages twenty eight not even
seventy pages right everything
is there are very clear scored
by the best economists in the
state and we know exactly what
we're going.
in twenty thirteen we didn't do
that right we we gave away
another in our tax code.
In exchange for a promise.
is that I would argue in many
cases we're still trying to.
Realized and so as a result of
these different policy positions
and as a result of a national
are recession as a result of
all you know I I don't know that
time we had another oil and gas
crash I think it was that was
like sixteen I think that might
have been your first year in the
legislature was missed my second
term
and what we end up with is ten
years of of of people leaving
the state you know we had out
migration happening
you know business is not sitting
in shop all individuals not
investing perhaps that capital
gains deduction that they
received ten years ago ten years
before that right
and so no it is just to really
begin to rebuild.
and I think I think members of
both parties Republicans and
Democrats on the house and since
I I think we are all trying our
best to rebuild in every way
that we can I'm reminded of of
all the great work that was done
a couple years ago with that
rocket docket we got out that is
that that that bill to to
address the the yield Walker Air
Force base that have sort of
been abandoned right and so we
got the best minds from both
sides of the aisle to come
together and create a pretty
complicated bill one that I
think is going to work.
Right and that's just one
example of the many different
things that we've done
collectively in a bipartisan
fashion to ensure that we don't
have another lost.
That in fact we not only not
lose it but we embrace it that
we thrive.
So that we built a much much
better society than what we
inherited when we walked into
these these doors of the
legislature.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen
yeah I would just
just so totally agree that
this step by step rebuilding
process one where where all of
the things that are are not
necessarily low hanging fruit
fruit but Mr speaker and
gentleman you know the will
increase in the working families
tax credit the increase in in
elector things that haven't
happened in so long things that
are holding us back like what
the gentleman from Santa Fe is
describing
we also Mr speaker gentleman we
have to work to responsibly
implement those knowing that we
remain in this incredibly
tenuous situation Mr speaker
gentleman in the past year has
brought all of us so much closer
to that deep awareness of the
uncertainty.
K. we're now in a place to I
think with your leadership began
making key progress in areas Mr
speaker gentleman that we know
health New Mexicans and with the
working families tax credit I
want to take too long speakers
of that if you might spend a
little bit of time just visiting
with us a bit more with the the
working families tax credit with
elector how that helps New
Mexicans because that that is
who we are rebuilding together
with.
so Mister speaker gentleman
those those seem particularly
important for broad suas
wherever we may live north to
south East West in New Mexico
why are those particularly
important for us as New Mexicans
in as representatives up here to
make the this key progress in
res
those amounts in your
legislation.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman from the line up for
that question.
as you heard before
Victor the lowincome
comprehensive tax rebate I was I
was created to address
Representative.
In our tax code help and it is a
really good program you know I.
That it also benefits low income
seniors every got to mention
that in the opening but it also
benefits low income seniors
actually get essentially twice
rebate other sixty five and
older so and it's it's income
qualified right so it's really
targeted at low income seniors
who might be on a fixed income
and social security and this
rebate provides some with a
little bit of help but
unfortunately what was not done
with this was created was in any
way hi it's to to to inflation
right and so you know nowadays
you have a a rebate that is
still based on nineteen ninety
eight prices I I saw chart
somewhere and and I don't have
in front of me but you know what
what what is what it eighty
dollars buy you in ninety eight
verses now and and it's it's
it's so we're difference right
obviously eight dollars still a
lot of money
When I go to Costco.
Things eighty dollars.
See we've already tried to speak
to the line ninety nine section
but up it's.
The value of those eight dollars
has has been completely
completed the last twenty plus
years and so through the through
the lecture section we are
increasing the rebate and then
we are also increasing the the
income threshold all right so we
go from
what I believe was twenty two
thousand dollars to thirty seven
thousand dollars right so family
making thirty six thousand five
hundred dollars can still
qualify for Victor that's
important.
Well we're screwed it we did a
good job two years ago
and you know
Relatively
My point of fashion I think
everybody sort of agrees with
this tax credit all works it
rewards.
Those who work for a living it
rewards a hard day's work
and it's based on the federal
one is as was stated earlier in
New Mexico for a long time we
had a ten percent of the federal
credit right so you multiply by
ten and a ten percent and you'll
receive that added benefit the
state I'm in twenty twenty
nineteen the bill that the house
passed actually increase it from
ten to twenty percent.
and then in negotiations with
the Senate as it was it was
invented in an initially
compromise we settled on
seventeen
this was in that we go back to
the twenty one twenty well why
not most I'm on average the
states that do have a working
families tax credit are at about
twenty two percent.
So twenty percent of the make
sense you know maybe visually in
a few more years we might come
back and and bump that up as
other states bump there's up as
well so that we're not that
outline.
and in twenty eighteen when when
I came back home you know after
long.
Grooming session after we had
these marathon negotiations with
the the Senate.
and you know I showed up to my
community and I said Hey like we
got this huge win for working
families right.
people are excited people were
were people are really excited
about it and then this one lady
says
did you say the word sex issue
yes Mister speaker and I said
yes yes the gross expert you you
helpful content seventy percent
this is a working we can work
with kids at home and and what
not you know.
The the textbook example of with
the working families tax credit
supposed to benefit.
And she was excited.
Yes it will why are you excited
lake you know we're a citizen
legislature I just got done
battling it out you know with
the senators and here's what I
got.
And she says I can't get it I
can receive it.
What what what do you mean you
can't receive it.
She said we don't file with a
social security number.
We don't have we don't have one.
We work we pay taxes.
We go to church.
We buy the products we clean our
houses we fix your cars with
your loans your.
We wash your dishes.
But we can't qualify for because
we don't have a social security.
So I immediately emailed I think
I emailed folks Council Service
I think I know folks and TRD I I
would advocate what do you mean
like how did we miss this this
is not a they don't they don't
qualify it just wasn't in the
bill and and I just never
thought that if you pay your
taxes and of the otherwise
qualified that you couldn't get
the benefit so one of the most
important parts of this bill for
me is ensuring that those
families can it can receive that
credit as well again the credit
is supposed to reward a hard the
needs work.
If you work hard.
If you file your taxes because
you pay taxes.
And you otherwise qualify for
this credit.
The lack of a social security
number I think we should have a
bearing on this at all.
Yeah so
one one last group that we're
expanding this to Mr speaker and
gentle lady because this is Miss
piggy backs off the federal
credit right so the federal
government doesn't allow people
to receive that credit the file
without a social security number
thank you father taxes they paid
taxes but they just can't claim
that credit.
The other group that that the
federal.
Credit excludes our young
workers without children between
the ages of twenty eighteen and
twenty four.
this legislature has done a
great deal of work over the last
few years
will make things a little bit
better.
Children aging out of the foster
care system.
you know these are these are
young people who are incredibly
talented and smart these are
children who are hard working
and through absolutely no fault
of their own so mom and our dad
or grandparents were around they
were placed in the order in the
system and we've done a
tremendous job supporting many
of you Republicans and Democrats
I have worked on bipartisan
legislation over the last few
years to make things a little
bit better
Young workers without children
that age group still qualify for
this is so the the foster care
community children aging out of
foster care actually brought
this up to us a couple years ago
well instead you know.
It would be great if we could
qualify you know if this is
helpful to us to.
and so we did a bill last year
including folks who filed
without a social security number
and including a young young
young workers without children
it passed the house but then he
ran out of time in the Senate
thirty day session time pressure
couldn't get it done that's why
those two included in here and
I'm particularly proud of those
two because I think that those
are the families and individuals
that we really really
Committee use help particularly
now during this pandemic Madam
speaker gentleman.
Madam speaker gentlemen thank
you so much I think I'll I'll
leave it there but madam speaker
through this debate through the
earlier discussion I am
thoroughly convinced Madam
speaker gentleman that the
legislation with your co
sponsors rewards work Madam
speaker gentleman it will
incentivize work as our state
our country our world gets back
to work Madam speaker gentleman
it does so in a responsible
manner that is I think in step
with each piece and madam
speaker gentleman as you talked
about as we work to rebuild as
we work to face a very uncertain
future with the strongest
possible foundation Madam
speaker gentleman the
legislation that you're bringing
tonight here for the body with
your co sponsors
it appears to me to be a key
part of that foundation not the
entire thing there's still a lot
of work to do madam speaker
gentleman in areas especially
with the goes gross receipts tax
with the pyramid in effect and
other things but Madam speaker
and gentleman you're showing us
the way bit by bit.
Responsibly taken each step
forward to move in that
direction and so I'm really
appreciate the conversations and
I appreciate deeply this
legislation it's bipartisan
administration and really the
cross partisan way that it's
bring some of the very best
ideas together and also miss
madam speaker and gentleman
again I think lays a foundation
for additional steps that look
to reduce the overall gross
receipts tax rate attacks things
like pyramid in and help us to
always whether and balance out
the the incredible commodity
cycles primarily in oil and gas
that we are so fortunate for but
also subject to deep challenges
because of thank you very much
madam speaker thank you
gentlemen.
Thank you gentlemen thank you
there's further debate the
gentleman from lead
Representative Scott.
Thank you Mr speaker before I
ask the gentleman from.
Four yield I'll talk record
Cheryl.
The will have a.
Propose to introduce it is fully
type approved.
And.
The former generally accepted.
Generally you do need to ask the
general to yield if you wish to
speak.
Thank you Mr speaker will
gentleman from Bernalillo yield.
I yield to the gentleman from
Lee.
This legislation.
For moving point.
Three raised revenue.
The other to utilize that
resume.
To help.
Sure litter program and the
working families tax credit is.
Mr Mr speaker and gentleman from
Lee yeah that that's generally
accurate yes.
So this.
Gentleman from Bernalillo could
you describe to me how much
gross revenue.
Will be raised with rate
increases for personal income
tax.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
levy according to our provide
economist at the LFC.
Roughly thirty one to thirty
three million dollars depending
on the year.
Mr speaker.
Gentleman from Bernalillo
the capital gains tax increase.
Mr speaker and gentleman is as
you know from the fiscal impact
report the capital gains
tax duction would race roughly
forty six million dollars a year
Mr speaker and gentleman from
the.
Mr speaker gentleman from
Bernalillo that comports with
state thank you for your and
these increases or expended on.
With approximately I believe
seventy three million dollars of
course it's too low income
families correct all Mr speaker
and and gentleman from from Lee
that that is correct low income
families and and low wage
workers.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
Sure the gentleman from Santa is
concerned there's three point of
this piece of legislation hi
Jim pretty much in agreement
with the tax increase portion
and how we pay for the for those
expenditures thank.
Schoening and I certainly
understand.
The need to balance.
Recurring revenue was recurring
expenses Mr speaker and
gentleman to do.
just.
All
tax increases.
There were developed in house
bill six here couple sessions
ago.
My recollection.
Those increases were about five
hundred to.
Million dollars.
Okay.
Remember.
All Mr speaker and and and
gentleman from Lee you know not
having the fiscal impact report
of house bill six in front of me
I cannot attest to the number
but I will remind the body Mr
speaker and gentleman that up
probably the the two of the
biggest tax increases in that
bill where the internet sales
gross receipts tax which Mr
speaker and gentleman from late
as you'll recall that's been
sort of a an elephant in the
room that we have to address
because it was putting so many
of our small businesses at a
huge disadvantage you know we've
all know the story of somebody
who walks into the you know
camera store and shops around to
see what they like and they
order an Amazon tax free that
was something that was impact it
was imperative for us to do back
in in in two thousand nineteen
this legislature had passed it I
believe in the twenty eighteen
session but he had been vetoed
by by the former governor the
other previous house bill six
raise taxes substantially Mr
speaker and gentleman was
bringing in the nonprofit
hospitals into the G. R. T. all
in all in only and even then
only at a specific rate I think
it's four percent in order for
us to be able to increase
things like reimbursement rates
for physicians working all
throughout the state ultimately
the the the only true tax
increases in that bill Mr
speaker enrollment that really
went to an individual that
really hit an individual was
that very very targeted five
point nine percent tax rate for
people making over three hundred
and fifteen thousand dollars and
a decrease in the capital gains
deduction from fifty percent to
forty percent so when you take
into account the tax increases
on individual's on it.
New Mexicans it was very much
targeted at a very high income
people and the increases were
pretty pretty low relatively
speaking Mr speaker and
gentleman from the.
Mr speaker and gentleman I can
appreciate all those comments
however.
Tax increases on businesses
generally don't stay there was a
business tax increases on
individuals to stay with the
individual so somebody.
Right.
Additional plus minus four
hundred million dollars as a
consequence of that legislation
now here we are.
In this this time looking at
another increase.
Of seventy five seventy five
million dollars.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
The small businesses.
People with good jobs.
May not.
Jobs this past year or hurting.
We're in the midst of a COVID.
And our small businesses.
And.
Owners for holding families were
hurting.
We really.
What's.
Increasing taxes.
US seventy five million dollars
particularly.

You
speaker I will stand for
questions.
First we'll go to the gentleman
from Bernalillo Representative
Martinez.
Is this
friendly substitute.
Mr speaker and and what will.
Jennifer Lee
I'm I'm going through the
nineteen pages of yourself to to
and I appreciate the
the summary that you again I'm
I'm trying to read line by line
I don't believe this is friendly
Mr speaker and and gentleman
from Lee and and I would like to
explain why I may and and ask a
few questions if I may Mister
speaker.
Jennifer Lee are you have the
floor.
Thank you Mr speaker and and
gentlemen
So one of the things that I
that I that I highlighted Mr
speaker and gentleman from the I
think it was to the previous
debater was how proud I was of
the fact that
this house bill two ninety one
has as you said Mr speaker and
gentleman I moving parts very
clearly written
and in FY are that is as good as
it gets
My concern Mr speaker one of my
concerns speaker development is
that I don't see an FIR for this
floor substitute Mr speaker
gentleman is there an FIR is our
fiscal impact report to your
substitute.
Mr speaker gentleman from
Bernalillo.
Not that I'm aware.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman from late I I
appreciate that that response
and and that can do this I I I I
am concerned
that we're asking the body to to
consider a.
What you say is that more or
less seventy million dollar tax
bill and we don't really have
the opportunity and not only us
but more importantly the
economists of the legislative
finance committee to really dive
deep into each of these
provisions to ensure that in
fact
this bill will
remain is revenue neutral as
possible or perhaps revenue
positive without blowing a huge
hole in our in our state budget
Mr speaker and gentleman from
the are you aware of the twenty
thirteen.
this tax bill that passed the
legislature in in at the end of
that session.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo what we do not have
an air flow on this particular
piece of legislation.
We do have phones.
The house bill that was just a
couple of days ago passed.
Regarding the revenues of the
sale of cannabis would generate
to the state that elected would
have to the revenue generated
which also was developed by LFC.
For the renewable energy payment
in lieu of servants.
Tax time.
Thank you for that response Mr
speaker and gentleman and and I
appreciate you highlighting that
for the for the body back to add
to my previous question though
so in twenty thirteen to the
benefit of the body that the you
know as as is the case usually
with these kinds of things to
their tax bills that went over
the Senate from the house in the
waning hours of that session a
tax package was brought together
and and without passing any
judgment Mr speaker and and
gentlemen on what previous bills
on a date or did not do I I do
remember vividly watching from
home actually on on the webcast
and having is similar like I'm
getting a little bit of the
General.
Legislators having a similar
discussion on the floor with
some sort of stuff substitute or
or or or relatively big
amendments to a particular bill
and I believe Mr speaker and
gentleman from eight if I
remember correctly they had
brought down
The the secretary of the of of
DFA for for the former governor.
and and I believe they they
suspended the rules Mr speaker
and gentleman from Lee from
twelve spent the rules and they
allowed him to speak I believe
and I believe what he said it
was at the fiscal impact would
be minimal or or you know again
some sort of random number that
really put a lot of pressure on
the legislature for that day
because they had a tax bill that
they really needed to pass and I
don't remember the specifics of
why they needed to pass it but
there is a bill of taxes that
they need to pass and then the
Senate attached all these other
provisions that day is secretary
of DFA came up and and you know
through no fault of his own just
missed Representative and it
weeks later and I just read this
article the other day former
chair to feel supported and it a
month later that seems secretary
of DFA apologized to an interim
legislative committee because
what you have Representative had
been wrong and and you know
again much we need to do not
know that you know but she kind
of went and pieced different
numbers together from different
FY ours came up with his own
number presented it it was voted
on it was approved by the
legislature signed by the
governor and it turned out to be
a pretty big deal so Mister
speaker Jennifer Lee what well I
really appreciate
you know the the numbers that
you've given us and and I
appreciate you know the sources
that you citing I'm still
feeling a little queasy about
about moving forward with your
substitute
Mr speaker and gentleman from
the let let me let me move on
from that point
let me let me go through this
bill here
and if if I'm not looking at the
camera apology some looking at
my I pad so my head is probably
too is that on your screen
so you are you acting the
renewable energy production
production act.
you Mr speaker and gentleman can
you remind the body with the
you mentioned that we had heard
this before can remind the body
was the renewable energy need
protection act act is.
Mr speaker I'm sorry but I
didn't get any question.
Mr speaker and gentleman
apologies for that can you
remind the body what the
renewable energy production tax
act is.
Mr speaker and gentleman that is
of servers of credits the report
to the generation of renewable
energy.
And Mr speaker and gentleman
from Lee are are these what kind
of what kind of credits are
these are these credits on on
gross receipts are they
severance taxes what are the.
Mr speaker and gentleman there's
a credits on the generation of
the.
And I think amount to about
thirty percent of your revenue.
Mr speaker and gentleman thirty
percent of the revenue of of of
the year substitute.
Mr speaker and gentleman that is
the federal production tax
credit are you asking about the
tax the.
In lieu of severance tax
contained in this bill is one
dollar per gigawatt hour of
produced our.
Thank you Mr speaker and and and
gentleman from Lee and and for
those of us that don't dabble in
in energy production can you
remind us what I can go on our
is what what does that look
like.
Mr speaker and gentleman I
misspoke to.
A good what is a thousand
megawatts so this would be one
dollar per megawatt hour one
city.
Per kilowatt.
It is generated in New Mexico
however to twelve point nine
five cents up to.
License with.
Very expensive our belief we
heard last night in the Tulsa
area.
that powers already eighteen
cents per kilowatt hour.
Mr speaker just gentleman who
who pays this tax
If if this were to be adopted by
the body.
That's the beauty of this.
Renewable energy's export.
It's going elsewhere and.
The impact
the citizens of New Mexico.
Mr speaker and gentleman so so
who is it paid by.
Mr speaker.
Because the customer's
purchasing apparel.
Mr speaker and and and gentleman
of the and this is this is for
renewable energy sources so
What can you can you describe
for the body what those sources
might be.
Mr speaker right now the
majority of those sources or
where generators located in
eastern New Mexico and the solar
facilities located pretty much
throughout the state.
And Mr speaker and and gentleman
you have a number of exemptions
for listed can you can you walk
me through those.
Mr speaker chairman really fuzzy
regressive to repeat question.
Apologies for that Mr speaker
and gentleman you have a number
of exemptions two two year to
year proposed tax can you can
you walk us through those and
and the reason for them.
Not just the speaker risk if you
can refer me to that specific
part try to.
Speaker John and I'm looking at
page three.
Mr.
Looks like the United States of
America the state of New Mexico
Indian nations.
All.
Thanks.
Considered residential
commercial or industrial
construction.
Mr speaker and gentleman if if
we were to impose this I mean
with this drive out of that
economic development tool from
New Mexico.
Mr.
It is the policy of this state
to some set up.
All in this in the revenue.
That that magnificent industry
has developed for the state.
And we are looking at a new
economy.
Is going to have to be based on
renewable energy somewhat.
This is just the first step in
recognition of that fact we've
got somewhere in the next thirty
years.
We've got a almost three billion
dollars of state revenue.
So uncertain till you
administrative and we do.
With the resources we have at
hand when we don't renewables
are the only game into.
Mr speaker and gentleman up
thanks for that response I'm a
little bit unclear about
something you said about some
sitting oil and gas.
The tax incentives of things
what you said what what are you
referring to what sunset.
When I was referring to tax
incentives at all what I was
referring to was our commitment
to be carbon free by twenty
first it.
And an agency speaker and and
and gentlemen
you know I I I'm a I'm a little
bit concerned.
Because you know on the one hand
we want to we want to
incentivize and provide economic
development opportunities in
every single one of our
communities and in my opinion
whether it's renewable or oil
and gas for film or or higher
education or or whatever it
might be as long as it's an
economic development tool we
need to take a very serious
thing we need to make sure that
we nurture it and that we allow
it to grow you know I I I I
suppose you are correct you know
that if the future of the world
is to be carbon free you know
that's I think that's pretty for
out in the horizon Mr speaker
and gentleman I mean just based
on the activity happening in our
own southeast corner of the
state Mr speaker gentleman would
you agree that those communities
continue to thrive and ensure
they took a hit the last few
months but it seems like they're
bouncing back from what the
gentleman from going on it was
saying would you agree with that
Mr speaker and gentleman.
German what I'm looking for in
the future.
Is some revenue stream that will
support your elector program
sure working family tax credit
programs and it looks to me like
it's going to have to come from
some source.
That is not petroleum related
and say I don't believe anyone
in this budget.
Can see anything on the horizon
absent.
Renewable energy sources now I
would include.
I just need approval in this
legislation if I could run
middle school truly disincentive
industry and don't generate any
appreciable.
Right now renewable energy is
basically wind and solar.
That's all we will have to tax.
When do we start.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman thank you Mr speaker
and gentleman from the for for
those for those strong points
there
did you consider as you were
drafting your your substitute
did you consider the state
Carbon credits some sort of
other way to pay for this.
Mr speaker and gentleman we.
This.
And what we looked at was
economy workers the state moving
forward down the road.
And it looks to us like it looks
to us like the legalization of
cannabis in renewable energy or
two of the potentially shining
stars in this new economy.
Let's small.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
Thanks are already holding
services.
What.
Try to utilize some of this new
economy revenue to pay for.
These programs the poor families
so desperately need.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman I I appreciate that
particularly that that last
comment you know the the my main
driver for for for my version of
the bill is to ensure that
working families and our low
wage workers get a little bit of
a break I have to say Mr speaker
and gentleman the other tax
increases that help pay for my
bill as I stated earlier are
pretty modest we're still not
back up to the eight and a half
percent which was our highest
tax bracket pre two thousand
three and by the way Mr speaker
and gentleman do you do you
remember what that eight and a
half tax bracket where it
started back in in in two
thousand to two thousand three.
Mr speaker and gentleman I do
not but I'm pretty confident
that you do.
speaking German yes it was it
was about a hundred thousand
dollars so the tax right back
and then and the tax brackets
we're proposing here today are
very different these are very
very modest and the speaker and
gentleman
as we to pay for my for for our
bill we create three tax
brackets you're not tree are you
creating any income tax brackets
in your substitute.
Mr speaker and gentleman we are
not raising any personal income
tax and not changing anything
with respect to capital gains we
believe.
The hardworking new Mexicans
that are paying these taxes have
been.
Seeing tax increases over the
last few years coupled.
What we comment pandemic.
That is.
This.
And.
Seven respond million dollars of
taxes to that pile may just
break the camel's back.
Mr speaker and gentleman let's
get some revenue and you've lost
some of this new economy revenue
and let our hardworking New
Mexico families keep their tax
money for now.
Yes.
If the new economy.
Does.
Which I hope it is.
New Mexico is where we're
headed.
That's what we need to be
looking for tax reform.
Thank you Mr speaker and and
gentleman and and I appreciate
those comments you and and you
know as as we one of the one of
the one of the things I
mentioned over and over again
when I was debating that the
cannabis bill was how important
it was from an economic
development perspective to
ensure that those industries are
you know nurtured and and and
allowed to grow.
In the fall.
particularly the newer
industries right and I also
mentioned how important it was
for us to be able as we develop
of that particular new industry
to to do it in a way that we as
policy makers can be fine so
that we're not playing catch up
later on the way we have with
other industries Mr speaker and
and and gentleman would you
agree that as we attempt to
develop a new industry whether
it's cannabis or whether it's
renewable energy would you agree
that it is important to nurture.
And incentivize and help that
industry grow so that eventually
it does produce the wealth that
we needed to produce in order to
benefit our citizens.
Mr speaker and gentleman
absolutely can't disagree with
that statement but we're not pro
proposing to increase any of the
taxes.
On.
On cannabis
already pass this test all we're
proposing to do is utilize that
money.
Instead of additional tax
increases on our citizens.
Mr speaker and and gentlemen are
are you.
I I I appreciate I think you're
you're you're point of agreement
with me that we need to make
sure that we incentivized and
and ensure that new industry or
relatively new industry can grow
and involved what do you would
you agree that renewable energy
production is a relatively new
industry in our state.
This gentleman would subsidize
the next twenty years.
Now it is still a tiny portion.
Of the total power generated in
this country expected to be much
larger portion.
All.
Now is the time to set the
stage.
Instead of it being a revenue
consumer instead of it being in
this chamber looking for tax
breaks now is the time to change
that paradigm and start
utilizing these magnificent went
insane resources that we have in
the state.
All right some revenue for the
state.
It is time for.
Mr speaker and gentleman I I
don't disagree that any industry
that sets foot in New Mexico has
to get back you know that's the
point of developing these
industries in growing these
industries I'm just concerned Mr
speaker and gentleman that you
know in in our in our quest to
keep very marginal very very
marginal income tax increases
say on folks who trade stocks
and bonds and and generate all
their income from that source of
that in our quest to protect in
hold harmless
we're willing to to to really
just potentially undo years of
good work that have been done by
this legislation speaker and
gentleman to roll the renewable
energy economy Mr speaker and
gentleman are you aware of of of
what happened in in Wyoming when
they when they proposed to
impose something similar on on
wind tax.
Mr speaker and gentleman
homework a wind tax is one
moment that a recently attempted
to increase on successfully.
Mr speaker I I think I think
part of that discussion led to
a.
A stall stalling of of several.
Projects that were in the works
and and that's what I'm afraid
of Mr speaker and gentleman I I
appreciate the sentiment and I
appreciate where you're coming
from and I agree with you again
that in time many of these
industries really once they're
developed and once they're set
need to make sure that the pair
their their their fair share I
think a lot can be said of of of
of industries that have been in
the that that I've had
incentives and benefits through
the tax code and are in the
books and that they don't really
need them anymore they're
they're a lot of those
industries as you know Mr
speaker and gentleman from the
that we probably need to take
off so that because they're
clearly well on their way and
they're succeeding but it makes
me really nervous that we would
do this.
you know and and potentially
Harmon industry just based on
the simple in in Wyoming that is
certainly something that can
foster Mr speaker gentleman I
just have a couple more
questions and and I appreciate
you walking me through this this
is very very helpful Mr speaker
and gentleman on on the on on
low on the lowincome
comprehensive tax rebate Mr
speaker and gentleman are there
any changes from your substitute
and my bill and if so what are
those changes.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman in the section where
you deal with the working
families tax credit Mr speaker
and gentleman do you does your
credit still apply to a taxpayer
files are taxes without a social
security number.
Mr speaker correct.
Mr speaker gentleman does your
tax credit so applied to young
worker without kids.
Mr speaker your question was
garbled.
My apologies Mr speaker and
gentleman does your tax credit
still apply to young child less
workers as in my bill Mr speaker
and gentleman let me repeat
there are no changes.
Mr speaker and gentleman there
are no changes to elector and
working families tax credit is
that correct.
Affirmative.
Mr speaker and gentleman you
mentioned something in in the
previous question about cannabis
and I'm I'm trying to find
cannabis in here and and you
said something to the effect
that we would use cannabis
revenue to help pay is that in
this bill or or was that just
sort of a figure of speech.
Mr speaker and gentleman the
cannabis revenue was in the bill
passed out of this chamber two
nights ago I believe.
and Mister speaker gentleman are
you up so what were you was it
sort of just an informal
proposition that that state
funding source that could
potentially pay for this tax
credit it's not actually in your
bill is that correct.
Okay very well I was concerned
because I kept using the find
function I I my and my my tablet
and and and it was not finding
cannabis so Mr speaker and
gentleman I I appreciate your
work on this I appreciate the
quick turnaround
I don't disagree with you that
industries that have a foothold
in New Mexico that are grown and
and are involved in our
generating revenues should all
pay their fair share all of them
and that includes renewables and
that includes oil and gas and
that includes any other industry
that is benefiting from our
wonderful natural resources be
it oil and natural gas be eight
wind be at our beautiful son
whatever that might be
I remain very concerned Mr
speaker and members of the body
and and and I do want to warn
the body
it makes me very nervous two
pass tax legislation without a
proper a full vetting by the
professionals at the legislative
finance committee we have made
mistakes before mistakes that
are very difficult to one do and
without proper vetting Mr
speaker and gentleman I can not
accept the floor substitute as a
friendly substitute I'm and I
would urge the by the body to to
reject the the floor substitute
with that I will yield my time
Mr speaker and gentleman from
the thank you for your
responses.
is for the debate on the
amendment the representative
from Travis city on terror
Representative Thomson.
Thank you Mr speaker.
I was about to think that global
warming would certainly happen
before we got in the bank
substantial so
Mr speaker Mr speaker I I don't
appreciate that comment Mister
speaker.
And I appreciate that.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
Can you tell me what.
First would you yell Sir.
Mr speaker all currently yield
to my friend from Travis county.
Can you tell me.
The renewable power.
Industries that we have.
Spam.
Millions of dollars on.
What they pay to New Mexico now
as they produce power
on.
Within the Mexico.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
Most of the taxes paid or during
the construction phase of the
project federal some excise
taxes to the utility companies
charge to get the power
delivered to hustles.
Particularly with respect to
these projects are generating
power for transmission to other
states once the gross receipts
tax and property taxes paid very
little tax revenue would flow
from the actual generation of
the power to.
New Mexico tax collection so.
Mr speaker and gentleman are you
telling me.
That the power.
That.
New Mexico taxpayers subset.
Through I. R. B. and many other
tax breaks.
We don't collect anything The
New Mexico taxpayers are
subsidizing the.
Installations and other than
construction costs the G. R. T.
in compensating.
Tax they're not paying any
severance tax and all of the
time.
Mr speaker and gentleman you're
correct.
So the bill before us tonight
that you're trying to amend.
The process we have two choices.
We can tax our neighbor.
Our friend.
A resident of New Mexico.
Or we can tax these guys that
send power to.
Outside of the state and that's
our choice is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Chavis sense about science of.
So the gentleman's bill.
That you're trying to amend.
Tax The New Mexico.
And the and we have an option
that you have present.
That would leave that New Mexico
are free and are constituent.
We would leave them alone.
And put a tax on.
Somebody by and this parent
California Arizona Nevada where
he has.
Is that right in my work in my
understanding that correctly
speaker and gentleman from
Travis you all understanding
that correctly and what is.
What is particularly concerning.
Is the direction that this state
is moving is toward a complete
dependence on these renewable
resource and we currently have
no plan in place to generate in
rural rural as we try to sunset
the petroleum industry in the
years to come.
Now is the time to take the
first step to to use the
resources that we have in the
state.
Actually generate some revenue
for the state.
Well
that's perfect perplexing.
And that total amount.
Is if I heard you right was a
dollar a megawatt so appealing
the.
A kilowatt hour Mr speaker and
gentleman from Chavis that is
correct.
That's very low that so will not
at all important.
those guys and if you remember I
just a couple of months ago.
We gave.
We get a for the body.
Gave away about.
Forty five or fifty million
dollars on one project.
These guys.
And so I think your amendment.
Makes perfect sense that gives
us the ability to get a little
of that back.
There's not anybody in this room
that's more business friendly.
In my opinion.
Then you and I are.
We want every business in New
Mexico Mr speaker and gentleman.
To not only survive but
flourish.
But putting.
Another seventy five million
dollars.
On the back of hard working New
Mexicans.
And leading.
A corporate.
Process that I refer to almost
as a welfare project.
They're not doing anything for
for New Mexico.
so so I I think what you're
proposing is spot on and I
appreciate it can you tell me.
Where you would capture the rest
of the revenue on your
amendment.
Mr speaker what we were
proposing to do.
Let's take the FY or generated
tax revenue.
Which during the committee
process was estimated at between
thirty and fifty million dollars
and utilized.
To provide the selector and
working class families tax
credits instead of raising taxes
we've we've already passed the
bill here to provide eight
percent of gross sales revenue
stream from cannabis sales
that's already cool and those
revenue estimates were
generated by LCS.
Well Mr speaker and gentleman I
I'm going to support your
amendment.
Because it's fair The New
Mexico.
And that's something that I
think we've kind of lost touch
with
Over the last.
A few weeks.
Doesn't make any difference
whether you're on the.
Majority or the minority it
should it should.
It doesn't make any difference.
What we all ought to be done.
Is protecting the jobs.
Of New Mexico and your bill.
Does that it captures revenue
sources.
It stays away from increasing
taxes on middle and higher
income New Mexicans.
And it provides the opportunity
for those to continue to grow
and do well I have to live here
anymore it spot on and I would
hope that the gentleman from
Bernalillo.
Would be given an opportunity
and on another order.
The idea.
That we should not look at an
amendment because it doesn't
have an FIR.
I almost fell out of my chair.
I have looked at.
A dozen bills or more.
That said.
Substantial.
undetermined.
Moderate.
Absolutely.
Did not give us any clarity.
So your amendment clearly
identifies the sources.
They're easy to calculate.
And they will be spot on thank
you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen for your amendment I
love for the sport this further
debate on the amendment the
gentleman from Dona Ana
Representative small.
Thank thank you very much Mr
speaker Mr speaker with the
gentleman from the you know
please we're.
Gentleman from Donna and.
Thank you thank you very much
gentleman from Lee thank you Mr
speaker thank you first Mr
speaker and gentleman from Lee.
I want to ask actually quick
question about our oil markets
Mr speaker gentleman is it your
understanding that much of the
oil produced in the Permian
basin
it goes mainly via pipeline to
Point there in Texas and then
there is ready for the worldwide
market.
Mr speaker gentleman from Donna
and that is correct.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentleman that that was my
understanding as well and I
mention that briefly just
because Mr speaker gentleman
when we talk about demand
hydrocarbon demand I think that
understanding the understanding
Mr speaker gentleman that the
production in the Permian
whether in our New Mexico
portion or in the Texas portion
that the worldwide demand has
Overwhelming impact upon that
market in and far far less
perhaps a minute amount of from
from anything in state Mr
speaker gentleman just a couple
other quick questions
Mr speaker gentleman this this
one dollar a megawatt production
tax one portion of your of your
proposed for amendment.
Do you know the other states are
what has that been put in place
in other states Mr speaker
gentleman.
Mr speaker and gentleman I'm
aware of a cliff to other states
Wyoming being one of the.
Don't believe I can name the
other one.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen I also am most
familiar with Wyoming Mr speaker
gentleman and a little bit of
quickly share some data points
Mr speaker gentleman that would
cause me great concern with this
ammendment Mr speaker gentleman
if you go back to two thousand
and nine.
there were roughly five hundred.
The more than five hundred
megawatts more Mr speaker
gentleman of installed wind
capacity in the state of
Wyoming.
So two thousand nine there are
significantly ahead of New
Mexico Mr speaker gentleman if
we the data that I'm looking at
and it's it's actually predates
some of our largest
installations Mr speaker
gentleman but as of twenty
eighteen New Mexico has actually
flipped that we were now Mr
speaker gentleman
Roughly two hundred fifty plus
megawatts more than Wyoming Mr
speaker German do you have any
sense why New Mexico not only
made up that difference but
actually went above Wyoming
during that time.
Mr speaker and gentleman
certainly confident kitchens
consequence taxable.
Choose to leader in wind energy
in this country.
Is our neighbor to the east.
With a dollar and a quarter.
One hour.
Production tax.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen
yeah we I look forward to the
the conversation about the Texas
approach Mr speaker German
especially their electricity
grid which as we discussed
earlier a few days ago on this
body its unique approach
reliance upon natural gas and
some other features led to some
pretty destructive consequences
but Mr speaker gentleman I agree
with you that the tax policy in
Wyoming
seems to be not only the two of
us agreeing Mr speaker John but
generally that's broadly agreed
that that is what
not only really stalled
installation Mr speaker John of
wind energy and in Wyoming it
kind of kept it flat almost flat
for an entire decade in Mr
speaker gentleman I guess if we
look at where we are now as a
state Mr speaker German would
you agree.
Setting aside some of the the
tax conversations that there are
literally thousands of jobs in
New Mexico right now for folks
working within this industry
whether that's on the generation
or the transmission side.
What.
And I would also like to point
out.
This body has mandated.
The.
J. comprise a significant
portion.
G. mix going forward.
I would also like to point out
that part of the problem with
one generation.
Development projects this
transmission capacity.
Thank you for share for each.
We are as we got the house to
the east and the Phoenix west we
enjoy significant advantages
with respect to renewable energy
and we should be taking
advantage of that okay and we
haven't even mentioned.
Eastern portion of New Mexico is
one of the prime renewable
energy wind energy.
Locations in the nation.
We need to be taking advantage
of those resources and.
With our neighbor just to the
east all right.
All right.
Taxed.
This production right slide.
We're proposing.
Thank.
In production.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen I always deeply
appreciate these conversations.
When I look at the Wyoming
models Mr speaker and gentleman
the absolute kind of the the the
brakes Mr speaker gentleman that
the exact same policy put on an
important economic tool Mr
speaker gentleman
and I and then look into the
fact that we have thousands of
jobs in New Mexico right now Mr
speaker gentleman well I
appreciate.
Much of the sentiment and
perhaps more than you of but
perhaps you I I appreciate
deeply the sentiment the idea of
slamming on the breaks the
brakes and threatening thousands
of jobs here in our state with
an example we've seen play out
in Wyoming convinces me that
I'm I'm unable to support your
for substitute and that the
questions but Mr speaker
gentleman thank you very much
for your time
very Mr speaker and gentleman.
For the day gentleman from
Bernalillo this.
And let's see County
Representative McQueen.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
German this gentleman you.
Mr speaker and gentleman I will
yield to the gentleman from all
of those counties.
Thank you Mr speaker down at
I think we're short on time so
try to be quick here.
If I can first clear my throat I
apologize but that first of all
just to confirm Mr speaker
judgment the property tax
provision in your bills the same
as in the the bills introduce is
that correct Mr speaker dollar.
Mr speaker and gentleman that is
correct identical and Mr speaker
John I just because that I I
genuinely appreciate that I mean
finding common ground on that
aspect of the bill which is
something I've been working on I
really appreciate I know the
gentleman Sandoval said the same
thing so I think that's great Mr
chairman I also appreciate that
you said you see cannabis as a
shining star in our economy and
I appreciate that and I guess.
Disappointed you didn't go for
it but.
This topic for another night.
Mr speaker German you're right
if if I memory surgeon on a
refreshment together is that
correct Mr speaker don't.
Mr Chairman believes is correct.
So Mister speaker done I'm in my
seventy year now and I think.
During the entire time I've been
here I've been on house energy
with you secretary.
Mr speaker and gentleman that is
correct.
So Mister speaker German I I
know you're on tax and I feel
like amid the disadvantage that
nana tax but this is kind of
bill I would love to see and
house energy so we can talk
about it learn more about it.
Let me ask you a couple quick
questions that come to mind do
you know the total generation in
terms of megawatts excuse me
megawatt hours.
We have in New Mexico from the
sources.
Mr speaker and gentleman I do
not have the number I do know
the textile energy just
Commissioned a new two hundred
and fifty megawatt wind farm in
eastern New Mexico let's check
what project but I can't tell
you the total capacity in
megawatts hours.
So Mr speaker Gemini the reason
I ask and I don't know the
answer either.
But you know you can you
multiply that by a dollar you
have a sense of how how much
this would bring in and that's
what I was trying to get that.
Mr speaker John and you do you
have any idea how this would
affect the electric rates for
the consumer.
Mr speaker and gentleman I had
the estimates of the of the
total power generation and the a
penny per kilowatt hour number
to develop our revenue sources
those numbers came from LFC and
I think someone just mentioned
that we've got eight million.
Medical doctors.
With.
Wasn dollars.
Mr.
Mr Chairman thanks for that
that's helpful but I I guess I
was since I'm short on time just
trying to move on quickly need
to know how this would affect
until the range for the average
consumer.
Mr speaker and gentleman for
most of our consumers are able
but the maximum impact as a
consequence of this legislation
would be one cent per kilowatt.
However most of this power is
being exported outside of the
state.
So Mr speaker German so you know
I I appreciate this being
exported I still think that the
in impact on consumers I'd be
interested in knowing what that
is but I also my understanding
is that some of these new
projects are coming in at.
Three or four cents a kilowatt
hour and so for your adding a
sent to that.
That's a pretty substantial
taxes in I mean are we talking a
twenty five percent or twenty
percent tax on that production.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
a bit of a misrepresentation our
going on the system is going on
at about three cents per
kilowatt hour however by the
time.
Transmission and distribution
and operating expenses are
included the retail rates for
this war range in New Mexico
well average thirteen cents and
in places that have embraced
renewables hello welcome to
twenty cents to twenty four
cents is the highest level in
some of our calls.
Okay Mister speaker German can
you explain on page three line
four section see there you spina
taxable value.
Mr speaker and gentleman but.
I want clear why we needed
taxable value.
Mr speaker and gentleman taxable
value is the wholesale value of
the.
Of the electricity.
The.
Generated by the facility.
Mr chairman I guess my question
is if we're taxing a flat rate
on every megawatt hour and not a
percentage of the value I don't
understand why why we have both
of those concepts in here I mean
I thought the item right above
it says it's a dollar megawatt
hours so regardless of value
it would be a dollar.
Yes the intent of this bill is a
flat rate of one dollar per year
to one hour.
So Mister chairman we don't need
to taxable value definition.
Mr speaker and gentleman
what is taxable value is used
here is just a descriptive term.
Mr speaker tell me that I think
taxable value would make sense
if we were appointed tax like at
the three percent tax a five
percent tax or whatever it is
then you would need to know
taxable value but in absence of
that.
I don't see how you why we need
that and I think that that's
just you know it's it's not to
be able to your floor substitute
Mr speaker German it's just just
an indication that you know this
for substance proposes some
pretty sweeping changes that are
in the bill and they really
haven't been but.
Mr speaker I'd really rather see
that not only through with our
taxes experts but also through
the house energy.
The impact on consumers so
Mister speaker gentleman what
what concerns me about your
services to is that yeah we're
shifting the burden from you
know the wealthiest new Mexicans
you know allowing them not to
pay a fair share and we're
actually increasing the taxes on
everyone because that we get
passed through to consumers
everyone has a utility bill
would end up paying a portion of
this because we're not taxing
the wealthiest Mexicans so
Mister speaker German thank you
thank you for your answers
Thank you Mr.

lady from Bernalillo.

This bill will and then the
Is relating to the water truck
transported it will amend water
transport so to will allow us to
let small mutual domestic water
systems
have a better chance at getting
these Water trust funds what
will what will allow is for
small mutual domestic water
systems there are that all over
the state to have access to of
the funds from the broader trust
fund what you should know is
right now there's about there's
about a thousand what is systems
mutual domestic or what
assistance in the state three
hundred of those water systems
are small mutual domestic water
systems in my district there's
forty three small water systems
but all over the state there's
three hundred these what is.
This is up of the three hundred
mutual domestic water systems a
hundred seventy five of them
have have service connections
but less than about two hundred
customers and what I'm trying to
do is kind of equalize their
chance to go before the water
yes board with the
with an application right now
they have to compete against
cities like Santa Fe in
Albuquerque to access funding
from this fund so that's what
we're trying to do we're just
trying to set up a program where
they have access to the fund and
they can apply for funding under
this program and have a better
chance and so that basically
wraps up the
Okay Mister speaker I stand for
questions.
This debate the gentleman from
Lee Representative Scott.
Mr speaker.
Briefly gentle lady hello
gentlelady yields.
I'll gladly gladly yield to the
gentleman from the.
Her dress and Tax and.
It was Representative this was
set aside of a service on can
you tell where the total value
of the fund the just ten percent
is coming out of.
Be happy to do that it would be
a ten percent set aside and the
of the water trust fund has will
this year had a total of fifty
three point three million
dollars of and gentlemen and it
will it has another and it from
another funded four million for
a total of fifty seven point
eight million dollars it would
be doing ten percent satisfied
first of all they have a fifteen
percent set aside for other
projects so this this set aside
would be about four point seven
five million dollars a year I'd
like to just tell the gentleman
and remind the house that there
are two other funds that come
out of the senior the senior
severance tax fund there is one
called the tribal infrastructure
fund and this one called the Los
Colinas infrastructure fund both
of those also get four point
five percent of the a senior at
severance tax fund and that
equals about twenty six point
six million a year for this year
so so both those funds are
funded at twenty point six
million dollars a year.
And of the what the trust fund
is funded at fifty seven point
eight million this year so so we
have set aside nine percent of
that fund for the water trust
fund project and then we set
aside another nine percent for
both Los colonias and the the
tribal infrastructure fund
however your small mutual
domestics have to compete
against major cities for where
they're sure that a fifty seven
point eight million dollar fund
that's I think if we have a ten
percent set aside should be
about forced point seven million
kind gentlemen five million a
year depending on how that
senior severance tax fund comes
in that's what we would set
aside for small mutual domestic.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
from that answer I believe our
call and testimony.
During the committee hearings
that there was some opposition
to this additional set aside
because it would.
He would replace perhaps.
Projects were more people might
be benefiting from the
expenditure could you could
could you elaborate a little bit
on that opposition and your
response to that.
Yes this is definitely a set
aside of of the of the of the
what a project funded and I
think it's it's fair to set it
aside for for smaller mutual
domestic water systems again
these are usually volunteer
organizations run by.
Right a grant go to this of
funding it's it's a hard
projects so I think we want to
help them get this
infrastructure in place kind
gentleman.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
to you for your interest.
Thank you gentlemen this further
debate the gentleman from Colfax
more of Rio Arriba and Senegal.
Rajoy Mr speaker doesn't
gentlelady yields.
the gentleman hold on
Representative Chatfield I I
called on the other gentleman

Mr speaker up all of the rate
hike all the resentment and
they're called on the gentleman.
Representative two FTE.

Arriba and Taos county yield.
Mr speaker yes I gladly yield to
my name
from
my neighbor to the north west.
Mr speaker gentle lady I want to
start off by saying I have great
admiration for your work in just
a short.
Couple of years if you have a
lead in my region on the issue
of water with great dignity to
nasty and going to to bring you
know a sort of a.
Real support to the mutual
domestic water systems that
struggle so much in the rural
areas of what's to you inspired
me to actually run I saw the
good I so well this leader.
Jump right in found a lane and
is bringing something really
vital a lot was the the the.
Is the most precious thing we
can we can support is the most
important issue you know looking
forward even I in ten years.
Water issues are gonna dominate
they already are so.
I don't have much else to add
other then I look forward to
voting for this and I admire you
very much are you back.
It is for the debate the gentle
lady Travis Representative
Ezzell.
Thank you.
You can.
Thank goodness.
Mr speaker will well the gentle
lady from rearranging our house
Santa Fe I'm sorry jobs for
workers as you've gone back to
using the mikes folks are
standing up to the debate.
I'll be glad to that way people
can see my time I am very proud
of my tiny Mr speaker will the
gentle lady from Rio Rita yes
and Santa Fe you'll please.
This to me Mr speaker I I gladly
yield to the lady from Chavis
with the S..
Mr speaker thank you very much
we heard this bill it was a
committee substitute in the
house second water committee and
the.
I'm the discussion took place
over.
Why there would be grants given
and I understand exactly and I
gave an example during the
committee meeting and that was
for the small mutual domestic
water systems that did not have
the means to even.
Get the ball started even though
they might be in desperate need
to Mr speaker and gentle lady.
One of the questions that I've
I've neglected to ask the.
Whenever we are assigning these
projects ten percent of.
The dollars that are going to be
available that's what these
smaller mutual domestics can use
so if there are not enough
projects does that what does
that ten percent money state.
In that particular fund for next
years she's served as a revert
back to the other funds for
other water systems can make
application.
We.
Right now that that money stays
in that fund for that ten
percent kindly Mr speaker and Mr
speaker gentle lady is that
specified in your bill.
Mr speaker kind lady I it is not
specified at this point.
Speaker I think that's a very
important aspect that if we are
setting this money aside for
these in.
Potential projects that are
coming forward from the smaller
domestic.
Of water systems that that does
need to be specified in your
bill I think it's very important
for trying to let the smaller.
Projects be able to take place
we have to ensure that money
does state there instead of
reverting back do not feel that
when Mr speaker gentle lady.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I I
was considering adding that and
talking with my co sponsor in
the Senate and taking that over
and that amending that be part
got to the Senate floor.
Mr speaker gentle lady if you're
gonna care this bill forward and
you're trying to help the
smaller Canadian mutual
domestics I think that would be
a very good amendments put on
there and I understand what
you're trying to do here it is
another car for about Mr speaker
as you stated during your
testimony and you're compelling
testimony and House agon Water
they're at the need is out there
for the smaller projects to be
able to get off the ground
because sometimes they are.
It is usually volunteer work to
try to get these projects going
and they don't have the means to
have any plans designed and and
along those lines even to get
the ball rolling that Mr speaker
I think it's imperative that
that amendment is that it on
before whenever it does go to
the Senate side Mr speaker
gentle lady thank you very much
for your responses.
Thank you kind lady to speak.
Thank you gentlelady narrow it
school periodically region of
Senegal and you the gentleman's
instructional io.
Mr speaker I think Leslie yield
to the distinguished gentleman
from all those counties.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady.
as you know I'm fairly familiar
with the process of talking
about and usually there's like
five to fifty percent for
watershed projects a certain
percent for them so reclamation
there's a certain percent for
endangered species of so my
question is.
Are are we are you going to try
to set up another phone.
Place another.
The place where only.
Our projects compete against
each other are you going to wait
them a little bit in their
competition to get some of the
bigger water project projects
I'm sorry I haven't seen the
bill others wondered how that
would work another category is a
word I was reaching for.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman it'll just be a set
aside for that.
mutual domestic water system
assistance in our state as you
know most of them are are run by
volunteers and then by
volunteers a woman by an all
volunteer so it really just is a
set aside of that Roddick water
project.
As do I they they certainly need
to need some help in and I
appreciate your effort and I
will support you feel thank you
the lady thank you Mr speaker
there is for the gentleman from.
The gentleman from Bernalillo
symbol of McKinley Sikora San
Juan and influencia
Representative Garcia.
Question of well those are the
young lady from our real real
Santa Fe and Taos piece you.
Mr speaker I kindly yep gladly
to the distinguished gentleman
from all those County.
Thank you young lady Mr speaker
only have one question on the
these funds that you're giving
out.
new water districts or small
communities that have are having
problems paying their past bills
can they just some of these
funds to catch up to rears of
what they owe the state is
still.
Mr speaker kind gentleman no
these water projects are really
to build infrastructure it's not
for operational expenses is to
build infrastructure so that
these are the best at mutual
domestics are I taking care of
so that they can you know
deliver clean water to their
constituents are that are
participants I should say
thank from young lady of Mr
speaker the reason I ask that
question of the community in my
district.
That is doing exactly what
you're talking about the Mr
speaker young lady and they run
into a little static in the air
in the rears of the calf don't
have enough money to finish
project we've got going so this
help them out in that sense.
Mr speaker kind gentleman this
is exactly what is meant to help
that.
Thank you Mr speaker not
financially that's a that's a
good answer and pass that on to
my constituents and really
appreciate your bill and look
forward to supporting it thank
you thank you Mr speaker.
Thank you John this further

Agility just a step back and and
a little piece of history the
water trust board of the water
Trust Fund Carrie came into
being to leverage state local
and federal dollars for large
regional projects.
I think the Gallup Navajo
pipelines one of those projects
eastern New Mexico originally
authority was one of those
projects.
And and there were several
around the state and as time
goes on and as governments
normally do
We pick away at those funds in
diminishing a little bit more a
little bit more a little bit
more.
Is a retelling region your bill
it it appears that the ten
percent that you're asking for
is ten percent of the entire
fund I I don't see that it's a
ten percent of a subset of one
of the other funds can you tell
me.
gentlelady I heard one of the
guys it spoke a little bit of go
said it was a.
A car out of a car about I
believe the term we use so that
is a ten percent of the entire
fund or is it ten percent of one
of the five existing car about.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
kind gentleman it is it it is a
ten percent car map of the
entire planet I misspoke and I
apologize it's it ten percent of
the entire time.
Tire Fund has a fifteen percent
aside to begin with and then it
comes down so so after that
fifteen percent and it's a car
that at that which is a left
over which is you know fifteen
percent of fifty seven million
at this.
Thank you Mr speaker John Levin
I understand that you know the
colonia something down south of
Los crucis have a card on it and
there's some major water
projects that have a a larger
percent there's a.
FY re use and re use water
projects as a little carved out
and so this would just be
additional one but I think this
one of all the small car out
system is probably gonna be the
biggest car about.
The bigger than the colonias I
think it was five percent down
there maybe maybe ten but the
clients and one other one
together I believe retentive
through two different carpets I
can't recall without the
document from me but
I I just one little
clarification whether was a car
out of of a car out or it was a
standalone not who sets a
standalone that's what I read in
the bill so I just want to
confirm that thank you Mr
speaker thank you gentle lady

realization that there's only so

that item Mr speaker on my co
sponsor ready and let the record
show that all action for placing
House Bill number two forty four
on final passage has been taken
and that is now subject to
debate amendment or
substitution.
Gentleman to explain it all
thank you Mr speaker and just so
the body knows that the
We have two expert witnesses of
if we do need to go to we will
serve for us because with the
office of the secretary of state
and gentleman for us who's
executive director of the ethics
commission house bill two forty
four is a bill that.
Is not a surprise because the
ethics bill that we passed two
years ago contemplated that
after some time we would be
revisiting whether or not we
needed to make some changes and
indeed there was a gentleman
that some changes needed to be
applied to the ethics bill to
delineate the duties of the
secretary of state and the
duties of the ethics commission
and this is the bill that we
bring before you today briefly
all of go through the the bill
and and briefly explain what it
does.
First.
For for Canada's in particular
it's very important to know that
the secretary of state will
maintain jurisdiction over
filing matters for a short
period of time to secure
voluntary compliance.
If the issue cannot be resolved
resolved fairly quickly then the
matter will be referred to the
ethics commission who has the
investigative arm and the
ability to to forward that
investigation and bring that to
our conclusion.
The there's delineation between
the two offices with respect to
political parties political
parties under this bill will.
Have to do a couple things that
number one inform the secretary
of state's office who the
officers are number two the
treasures of those organizations
will have to attest that they
understand the duties of they
are engaged in and thirdly
they will the political parties
will also have to identify
members of affiliated parties to
the best of their knowledge so
for instance in Travis county
the state Republican Party would
have to reveal who the officers
are of the Travis county party
yes the Travis county party does
reveal that information to the
state party second thing it
covers a obviously the
candidates that are running for
office and the financial
disclosure requirements and all
the requirements that we go
through as candidates thirdly
lobbyist importantly the
political
committees other very important.
It has a provision to maximize
the finds that maybe do an
ongoing for violations of are
reporting laws and.
The other thing it does it
brings the ethics commissioner's
into compliance with us having
to file annual financial
disclosure statements to reflect
the commissioners themselves
have a an obligation to bring
those parties in the compliance.
Mr speaker with that I'll turn
it over to my.
Cosponsored he can correct
anything I said was incorrectly
thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen this is a good bill
thank you Mr speaker thank you
John.
With that Mr speaker we stand
for questions.
Senator San Juan Representative
Montoya.
Used to.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman just interested in one
question concerning this
hand off of responsibility at a
certain point concerning
compliance.
so Mister speaker and gentleman
the standard for reporting
financial disclosures statements
there's a five thousand dollar
minimum.
Number that says when you if you
make less than that from a
single source.
The secretary of state's office
states that you don't have to
report that.
Specific income but the ethics
commission has been
For some reason using a
different standard so I'm I'm a
little concerned that if
Yes some of the things that are
under the secretary of state's
office for compliance is the
same standard going to be there
for the ethics commission and
maybe you can ask one of your
expert witnesses for that for me
Mr speaker and gentleman from
San Juan I do yield and we will
ask the experts for.
That information hang on.
Mr speaker and gentleman the
answer is the same for both
agencies for about the ethics
commission and for the secretary
of state thank you Mr speaker
thank you John the gentleman
yield at.
Mr speaker I think my co sponsor
answered so Mister speaker I've
maybe I was a little distracted
could you repeat that answer for
me.
Will the gentleman yield.
Yes I am thank you to thank you
John thank you Mr speaker Mr
speaker and gentleman it's the
same for both thank you Mr
speaker thank you Jill thank you
miss out on just just to
reiterate I I understand that
the standard whatever the
standard is that secretary of
state's office has that will not
change once it goes to the
ethics commission after that
period of time correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman that
would certainly be the the call
and I believe that the to
administrative agencies are
working hand in hand to assure
that there will be consistent
approaches to all issues that
involve the.
Rules that we as candidates are
under and lobbyist for under and
political committees and
political parties.
Thank you Mr speaker glad to
hear it.
There is for the debate the
gentle lady from Chavis.
Mr speaker will the gentleman
from.
This material please and I guess
the gentleman from Bernalillo as
well just so I'll be on the safe
side and get it done right now.
Mr speaker I will gladly yield
to by.
The first office made and
brought me under this body thank
you.
What a mistake that was Mr.
Thank you Greg Mr speaker
gentleman from Chavis no terra.
I have not had a chance to read
this bill in its entirety but I
do want to ask some questions as
on page five please have your
bill under section thirteen.
Now wait until you let me know
that you have found that
particular area that I am
talking about.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I I
hope you're talking about
section three and not
thirteenth.
I said I thought I said section
three.
I'm gonna serve and.
I am there okay Mister speaker
understood under a it states
that the secretary Sheikh State
sheltered by and seek to educate
all persons Mr speaker I guess
the first thing that I would
like to say there the secretary
of state's website sucks.
Also.
Mr speaker you said that this
includes advising on the
reporting individuals at least
annually at that acts deadline
for submitting required reports
as statements of no activity Mr
speaker and gentleman.
Do you know what happens
whenever a candidate is running
there's no opposition they
closed out there can't do you
know what that particular
candidate has to do even though
there is no opposition and they
cannot run for another term
legislation of county commission
do you understand what the
secretary of state's office
entails whenever there is no
activity.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
think I heard the story once
before and it wasn't quite as
simple as maybe this language
would indicate but hopefully the
secretary of state's office will
streamline that process so that
the statement of no activity
will be the conclusion and that
person who is no longer running
for office can quickly close up
their books and not be subject
to further reporting
requirements and Mr speaker
gentleman it that's exactly what
does happen in a situation that
I've just required even though
they get count has been closed
in the in an instance where
person cannot run for office
again the counts been closed
there's been no activity yet
they still have to file a
campaign report what a waste of
time and resources in the
secretary of state's office to
get that done Mr speaker and
gentle gentleman also I'm
reading one of the notices and
it says that
creates new obligations
political committees their
responsibility under the
campaign reporting act and
requires treasures to notify to
sos when there is a resignation
or change in treasure what if
there is a committee that does
not have eight campaign that
does not have a treasure it is
the actual person themselves
that is to and finally.
Mr speaker gentle lady let me
check with the secretary of
state's office but I believe the
treasures one the required
officers that you need of the
let me verify that Mr speaker
gentleman I have checked and you
do not have you can be.
The lead on your own campaign
you do not have to have a
treasure.
Mr speaker and gentle lady to
answer first question treasure
is required even if it's a party
who is running for office or as
of the head of the campaign
committee somebody has to be in
the position of cracking the
money and reporting.
And Mister speaker what better
person to do it than the
candidate themself Water waste
of time trying to get this done
especially for people that do
live that rural areas that their
treasure might be in a
metropolitan area and that
particular district but they're
gonna have to take time out as
I'm just really fed up with the
some of the stuff that's going
on here Mister speaker one other
question I have.
the state for is it.
I'm sure that my account will
probably get audited now that's
okay I am my own treasure and I
do a good job with books Mr
speaker gentle gentleman from
Chavis no Tero.
Whenever we did create this
fourth branch of government by
creating the state ethics
commission of.
We is your bill is seeking.
Let me help us hold on here to
say.
Mr speaker it's going back to
page three I missed it there
okay Page three.
It's a political committee fails
to update the statement of
organization.
Are there penalties in your bill
it that is not done as
prescribed in subsection date of
deception.
Mr speaker gentle lady there are
penalties for virtually every
violation that can occur under
the act and and that the and
section II it says a.
Subject to a fine of five
hundred dollars and Mr speaker
gentleman from Chavis now
terrified the five hundred
dollar fine one out of fifty
dollar fine one out of five
thousand dollar fine it was that
just a number you pulled out
where did that come from.
Mr speaker gentle lady that came
from the secretary of state's
office and basically the ideas
the political committees should
Should have to pay a significant
provide for their failure to
comply with with the statute if
it's an act and that they would
be in a position to pay those
for the finds the lower fines
are generally with respect to
campaigns that do not have the
ability to raise much money so
you'll see fifty dollars fines
and other things for the.
Positions that generally don't
raise more money positions and
raise more money have higher
thresholds for funds we can go
through that if you wish and Mr
speaker gentleman from Chavis
note here in case these if a
political met committee fails to
pay that fine what what happens
then.
Mr speaker gentle lady the funds
are creating and in this bill is
a maximum level of finds that
can be approved we maximize the
fine levels for the various
entities in the bill that's one
of the components of the
secretary of state thought was
important because there were
many instances where people
racked up fines and they
continued on and on they can be
collected so they maximize them
in hopes that maybe of the
ethics commission could could
get those things collected
without the too much problem.
Mr speaker was that my time up.
Mr speaker I think that was a
time I guess the only that was
your time thank you.
Remember I'm from Lincoln County
not the Otero excuse me Mr
speaker the gentleman from
Chavis and Lincoln my apologies
there I knew that I knew that
you Representative lane can as
well as Chavis County Mr speaker
her second home.
My second how Mr speaker happens
to be the barn out there on the
ranch and my husband second
homes the doghouse because
that's usually where he ends up
sometimes a point point of order
under the following was going on
I I feel like there's the the.
Yes yes so.
Gentlelady from Chavis do you
need a minute.
I thought the timer went off the
state you were just getting off
my debate there Mr speaker so
you know that's what the cases
are that's right I forgot
there's further debate the
gentle lady from sentencing.
The way you're looking at me I
didn't hear you Mr speaker.
Generally from Chavis the floor
is yours if you'd like to ask a
question of the gentleman from
Chavis and Lincoln.
Mr speaker I guess it really
matters of.
He's he's just going to get him
to give me a hard time whenever
you get back in Chavis county or
Lincoln County where his
favorite constituents are thank
you Mr speaker.
There is there are so many
inside jokes flying back and
forth it the service on this
side of the chamber of no idea
what's happening but I will try
to get that so the chamber fall
directly on the gentle lady from
Santa Fe Representative Serrato.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln at yield.
Mr speaker I will certainly
yield to the gentle and.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you General Chavis and Lincoln
I'm I will continue on the the
questions of the gentle lady
from Chavez also raise and just
kind of curious if there's any
if currently the secretary of
state's office offers any sort
of support for these
political committees in rural
communities.
Mr speaker and gentle lady of
the secretary of state's office
is generally available to assist
them people who do report they
have they have training
generally amounts that you can
sign up for as well as
that Kerry for us because more
the expert here which is con can
be contacted and see to walk you
through the process is and I
think that there are many many
resources at the you can avail
yourself of with the secretary
of state's office.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman from Travis I I
appreciate that I I guess I'm
kind of curious because I have
known you know a number of rural
can you know because I mean any
insurance you know better that I
do you know and and Chavez and
Lincoln you know so many of
these rural you know political
action committees can committees
themselves are made up of
volunteers and oftentimes you
know someone who may have been
in a position like a treasure
position for you know decades
may leave and that becomes very
difficult and onerous on the new
folks that that that occupy
those positions and I just I
want to check with you having
that for those counties if you
feel that those those outreach
efforts are satisfactory to
somebody who may be taking over
opposition you know that that
maybe you to them.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I'll
be quite Frank with you you're
talking to somebody who hates
the electronic filing system so.
And I've told this to to
mistrust because a number of
times I absolutely hate it
because it yet the requires some
things that doesn't quite work
and we had to work around a
couple things but
I can tell you that they've been
most helpful to me and I think
most helpful to to a number of
people who have problems I would
tell you this one thing this
bill does it makes treasures of
political organizations
including candidates and
political parties and these
political committees it it it
has provisions in there that
those treasures need to
recognize the seriousness that
they're signing up for and and
the liability that they might
and for as a result of serving
as treasurer of that
organization so there are
provisions in here that the
attempt to.
Notify people stepping into
those roles that there are
reporting obligations and there
are obligations that they you
for by virtue of that office.
Thank you Mr speaker you
gentleman from Chavez at a yeah
that's I think all my questions
I'll do the rest of my questions
thank you.
The number of the debate
gentleman a close.
Thank you Mr speaker this is a
good bill.

item thirteen are you ready on

Thank you Mr speaker can you
please give me to that point but
the record reflect all action
necessary for taxation and
revenue committee substitute for
House Bill fifteen.
The election is surfacing house
taxation revenue increases you
prosper fifteen final passage
has been taken gentlelady to
explain it all.
Thank you Mr speaker and members
of the body possible fifteen
amends the state will building
tax credit from twenty fifteen
that twenty fifteen tax credit
has been instrumental in
transforming the market for new
buildings in New Mexico the
state has updated the energy
conservation codes since the
first credit was passed now we
need to update that tax credit
to make sure that we're creating
incentives for builders to go
over and above the updated
building codes to build the most
efficient and sustainable homes
the bill allows for tax credits
for retrofits of existing homes
low income households will get a
double refundable tax credit to
make investments in energy
efficient products and systems
this bill has an annual cap a
sensitive twenty twenty seven
and includes annual reporting
requirements and with that Mr
speaker I stand for questions
there is debate the gentleman
from curry sorry yes John curry
Representative Crowder.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady please yield.
Thank you Mr speaker I yield to
the gentleman from.
McGinnis.
Yes thank you correct.
Thank you.
Generally I received an email
today
from a gentleman that was the
bill Greene New Mexico program
director since two thousand nine
members of the stakeholder group
that developed the original
system sustainable building tax
credit custom home builder and
an instructor green building
practices.
And
I'm assuming gentle lady you
have a copy of that letter is
that correct Mr speaker.
Mr speaker and that gentleman
from curry I I don't know if I
have that a copy of.
Thank you general I was elected
gentle lady what is it that
Has this gentleman so upset
about your bill if he is the
gentleman they carried the
original sustainable tax credit
bill.
What what's causing all his
heartburn the gentle lady Mr
speaker.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
curry I I think that there is
some disagreement about the
purpose of the tax credits you
for me I see our tax credits
really is a waste of for the
government to incentivize and
and move the market forward
we believe I believe that this
is an all of the tax credit
should be available for the most
simple building Texas techniques
and because we've updated our
energy conservation codes.
This at what where we were
before I barely ate it meets
that code in just above so this
new tax credit raises you know
raises the bar so you know I
think we we need to be using our
state funds to really
incentivized
the continuing you widespread
building techniques that make
these homes more efficient that
go over and above the code I
think that's where that's where
the differences lie.
Thank you Mr speaker so it is
your bill include a list of of
items that help you achieve the
sustainability.
that you're seeking.
Mr speaker and gentleman it does
include a lot of different
energy efficient drugs and and
process these things like heat
pumps and
Oppressors and and us.
insulation windows doors things
like that.
Okay so the generated is yours
continue to require
eight certification board or yes
but Leicester yes all those
types of items that are in the
original sustainable tax credit
is your bill include efficient
water systems along with the all
the other achievable goals.
Mr speaker and gentleman it does
include efficient water heaters.
Thank you I just like to.
Can read the one comment here
the competition it's it's is a
legislation focuses wrong lead
to an overall decrease in
efficiency of single family
homes.
Create job loss and the valuable
green industries that built
better homes based on science
not on list a mandatory items it
would be a shame to go backward
to the dark ages of building
homes and so I've known this
gentleman for about thirty or
forty years and and I've never
seen him write a letter quite
this chart.
And it caught my attention and I
have not had an opportunity to
read the bill but it's apparent
to me that there are substantial
changes from the original tax
credit bill the one your
proposing now so thank you Mr
speaker thank you gentle lady

gentlelady from any are you

Yes Mr speaker would you get to
that point please but the record
reflect all action necessary for
placing House Bill to twelve on
final passage has been taken
gentlelady to explain the bill.
Thank you Mr speakers Mr speaker
members of the house so I'm
house bill two twelve is very
important bills to whatever
community colleges here in the
state we just start by saying
that seventy years ago New
Mexico had the creation of its
very first community college of
the September I believe of
nineteen fifty and that that
call which was called Carlsbad
instructional center located in
Carlsbad.
And so it was kind of a neat
milestone this fall to to
celebrate that seventy universe
right
in the nineteen sixties the
crosspad instructional center
came under the umbrella of New
Mexico State University and they
banded together thinking that
they could work better together
and that there would be a
synergy between the two
institutions so if it's been
that way now for for a while but
for some compelling reasons we
think it's time for the Carlsbad
instructional center which is
now known as in New Mexico state
Carlsbad to once again
achievement attendance status.
Mr speaker and members there are
currently seven independent
community colleges in New Mexico
among them Santa Fe community
college central New Mexico
community college San Juan
college for this community
colleges Mason lands and I might
add
New Mexico junior college as
well they all have their own
separate accreditation and
really the difference between an
independent and a branch is for
governance of the community
college and so in the case of
house bill two twelve the
proposal is to re organized the
Carlsbad branch into independent
and we hope to achieve the same
kind of successes that are are
found at the other independence
in the state.
I think the part of local
governments governance Mr
speaker is very important
because people who land in the
local area I understand the
needs of the community the best
and in the case of Los crucis
the main administration there
several hundred miles away the
communications are not that good
and a lot of times when the
Carlsbad branches ask for
programs or certificate programs
to be added and for dormitories
to the bills are for a better
pay scale to attract professors
to our area that has a very high
cost of living and campuses not
been open to those those those
changes so.
Right there is no debate if you
would like to offer this is a is
your closing that would be just
fine.
Mr speaker I I can't their offer
so I move that house bill two
twelve do now pass.
We're on final passage of house
bill two twelve the vote is now
open.
Thirty seconds to close.
The clerk to call those without
a recorded vote Representative
Lujan.
Yes Representative Lujan both
yes Representative Nibert.
Representative Serrato.
Yes Representative Serrato yes
the vote is now closed level to
sixty two in the affirmative
seven inning if house bill two
twelve has duly passed the
house.
Last bill.
The gentleman from Colfax more a
Rio Arriba and Senegal are you
ready on item number fourteen.
Mr speaker I am Mr speaker will
you give me to that point for
the record reflect all action
necessary fleecing house bill
sixteen as amended with an
emergency clause on final
passage has been taken the
gentleman to explain the bill.
Mr speaker Mr speaker and and
the body I I bring forth a bill
called the rural opportunities
act house bill sixteen it seeks
to create an interim committee
that would be short term two
years it would be comprised of
fourteen members by Camberley.
Members of every standing
committee for the express
purpose.
Of creating.
Ability to deliberate and
deliver product around rural
infrastructure for water
waste water electricity
broadband and internet services.
I'd like to state that I am this
is my first time on the floor I
know that I passed two bills
already they were so short I was
prepared with deliberation and
questions but I just want to say
that.
There's a great deal of
bipartisan support twenty four
members have come forward and
they have offered their support
and I want to just say thank you
I now offer that we.
That we stand for questions
thank you so much thank you
gentleman there is debate the
gentle lady from grant Hidalgo
and this year thank thank you Mr
speaker the gentleman yield.
Yes I yield to the gentle lady
from Dona Ana.
Thank thank you Mr speaker and
thank you Representative thank
you for sharing this bill and
it's it's pretty impressive that
during your freshman year you
realize that there is a need to
elevate
and promote equity in our rural
areas Mr speaker and and
gentleman what do you envision
in in your best case scenario
what would you envision as the
outcome of this interim
committee work.
Focused and intentional look at
where we need to go with
infrastructure we know that
there's a great divide between
the rural and the urban.
There are tremendous needs our
communities across rural New
Mexico are suffering and so my
hope is that this committee will
deliberate with an open heart.
With the bipartisan approach to
look critically at where we need
to go with infrastructure be it
broadband be it waste water
wherever we go that's what we'll
focus on.
Thank thank you Mr speaker thank
you Representative and I think
it is something that needs to be
looked at so many of the themes
of the bills are how do we get
critical services to rural New
Mexico this one's infrastructure
but I I I assume we can have the
same conversation around
behavioral health services
around highly qualified
educators around adequate access
to health care of personal
assistance for families with
disabilities are senior meal
sites home delivery it seems
like we could go on and on
analyzing the disparities in
metro and rural areas and Mr
speaker and representative I
think part of what we're going
to see is hopefully this shows
the distribution of capital
outlay in the distribution of
funds and we find a more
equitable way to distribute
those so you know I know if
you're like me we have entire
communities with no access to
sewage they're on septic Mr
speaker and gentleman entire zip
codes without a paved street
just dirt roads Mr speaker and
gentleman an entire areas that
have to use wood burning stoves
in order to keep their homes and
and Mr speaker Representative
thank you for allowing me to
sign on to this bill and I look
forward to watching the work of
the committee if I'm not part of
it thank you Mr speaker.
Thank you generating there's
further debate the gentleman
from Chavis Representative
Ezzell.
Mr speaker will the gentleman
from Colfax more re of B. real
right and San Miguel yelp please
yes I yield to the gentle lady
from the south Mr speaker thank
you very much I understand what
you're trying to do here you
have all these how the committee
is comprised of eight members
from the house representative
appointed by the speaker ninety
six from the Senate appointed by
the Senate pro tem.
you also have one for me to.
They are they include a member
from the legislative finance
legislative education study
health and Human Services
revenue stabilization tax
finance oversight water natural
resources Indian Affairs Land
Grant science technology and
telecommunications and
transportation Mr speaker that
is a very impressive list to
have their that is going to make
up.
This in our Canadian for rural
opportunities the one thing I do
see missing from this list of
very distinguished people that
you have thank you Mr speaker
and gentleman is anybody from
those particular rural areas
fire where they amended.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I'm
not sure I follow your line of
questioning the interim
committee is to be comprised of
members of those committees that
you mentioned and inherent in
that will be membership equally
distributed we did an amendment
to this that included I believe
I work with Representative
Nibert to look at all four
quadrants to have equity
inclusivity and functionality I
hope I answered your question
gentle lady from the cell Mr
speaker no you did not.
Mr speaker and gentleman I want
to know whenever you have split
up state into quadrants are you
going to have any representation
from those particular quadrants
that will give input to this
very impressive Committee that
you were trying to put together.
Miss Mr speaker and gentleman
that won't work I want to hear
the right answer are you going
to have any representation from
the rural areas instead of
people that may not know those
rural areas making the decisions
on what they need.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
absolutely yes I am a
representative of a rural area
and I have every intention of
inviting the public to
participate equitably and
representing all quadrants I
hope I answered your question
gentle lady from the south Mr
speaker at that point you
finally did because the question
I'm trying to get us here is a
and a previous administration
they decided they wanted to
beautify the rural areas of our
state and I know that at the
area of let's see I guess that
would be Picacho in between
riverside and Honda so and US
seventy two seventy three eighty
there is the most ungodly piece
of art work there that the
people absolutely hate they had
no input as to what was going to
be erected there permanently in
that area Mr speaker I think
it's very important that our
rural area does have a voice in
helping make decisions for
what's best for their particular
areas Mr speaker gentleman would
you not agree with that.
Yes I agree absolutely it is not
my intention to beautify our
state is beautiful are ready our
state absolutely needs Mr
speaker and gentle lady
infrastructure in United and
focused way to get the job done
and that's what this bill will
be.
Mr speaker and gentleman I was
not talking about putting up
beautification structures that
was an example from lack of
input from the local communities
and what I'm trying to get it
you have this.
List of all these appointments
that are going to be made and I
just want to make sure that our
rural areas do have improved
whenever.
This committee that you were
wanting to set up makes
decisions on what our rural
areas need in each quadrant of
the state the rural
opportunities Mr speaker in our
rural areas there is lots of
opportunities for entrepreneurs
to get businesses started to be
able to go whatever the root of
the rail may be.
But I think it's very important
that these local areas.
Inform the committee on what the
needs are at that particular
area Mr speaker.
I think of this kid this
question and I think it's a good
one to just.
Mr speaker.
This committee is going to be
prize comprised of eight.
Now I can't even count that high
it didn't seem like are these
people that are going to serve
on your committee that's going
to be appointed by the.
Of house appropriate the speaker
of the house and the president
pro tem are they going to be
reimbursed for any sort of
travel or per diem.
Mr speaker and gentle lady some
thank you so much for that
question.
Okay so believe in this interim
committee and the need to do an
emergency clause that I'm
putting forth one hundred
thousand dollars of my junior
Fund to ensure that the
committee has the capacity to
pay for the things you just
outlined.
Mr speaker gentleman that is
very generous of you to do that
that Mr speaker.
That money has to go through the
approval process and while I
really do admire what you're
trying to do here.
These people that might be
appointed to that committee.
May not get paid their per diem
or their travel and that gives
me great concern Mr speaker and
gentleman Mr speaker.
And of Representative.
Does the rural economic
development committee.
The basically the same thing
that you're trying to accomplish
with this bill.
Mr speaker and gentle lady the
rural economic development
committee does tremendous work
it's focused in one key area and
in speaking with the chair of
that.
Committee Representative Maestas
when I just in the pointed
question is my bill.
Not worthy and he said no we
want to expand we don't want to
silo we want to be inclusive and
have all of the players at the
table to make the critical
targeted focused decisions on
where to move best to serve the
rural needs of this glorious
state.
Gentle lady I hope I answered
your question.
Mr speaker I didn't quite hear
use use referenced
Representative my instance could
you go over that part of but
again I didn't quite hear all of
yes as a freshman I I thought
through this process rather
deeply and I consulted many many
colleagues and I reached out to
chairman my SS of the rural
economic development committee
and asked him for his advice
about the formation of the bill
this is early on and he
eventually signed on to the bill
but he said.
Your proposal will allow an
expensive inclusive full picture
look at the state.
His committee does great work
but it is focused on just the
rural economic development
piece.
I hope I answered your question
gentle lady from the cell.
Mr speaker and gentleman like I
said I admire your intent of
what you're trying to get done
here at this analysis right here
that I'm looking at at the
moment it to use you're wanting
to address issues of smaller
populated non urban areas so
Mister speaker whenever we're
talking about that proves
specific thing that I just
mentioned.
Is there a population limit
that's going to be attached to
that what does constitute
smaller populated non urban
areas.
There are many areas Mr speaker
and love the gentle lady from
the south.
That.
Characterize that are
characterized as rural even a
city like Espanyol of ten
thousand.
micro regions of course our
sense this is not fully in place
so there may be some shift.
But I assure you that the
intentionality behind the bill
is to go to the very.
Desperate areas of need.
You know my team and I took
about eight days and we went to
the front that are they make you
go to less Cologne yes we were
in Shiprock in Madha Intel's in
Farmington looking and talking
and seeking the answers of where
to place this work.
And I assure you there is
tremendous needs on the smallest
population centers to the mid
and even into the urban.
Let's face it this is not a
competition against urban and
rural but there is a long and
desperate need to bring equity
to the rural areas and I will be
a champion for this I'm laying
capital down.
I'm laying my reputation which
is brand new in this body.
But you don't know me yet but I
am quite an organizer I spent
thirty years.
Alternating community.
Building unity and finding
success with tremendous projects
a great meaning so I assure you
gentle lady from the south that
my integrity is what I say.
Mr speaker gentleman I'm not
question your integrity one I I
would I want to make that very
clear I'm not questioning your
integrity I am just my concern
here is you have fourteen people
that are going to be serving on
this committee.
Do you expect them to travel to
the areas that you have just
laid out that you have travel to
that you and other people of
travel to because this is.
It it with no appropriation
specified other than your your
house bill or your capital
outlay.
I'm just very concerned that
a lot of these people.
Really don't want to travel to
areas like.
Where there is nothing there and
Mike in my particular district I
have what they call a bedroom
community.
It consists of the water
department it consists of the
school and that is all they have
other than the residents of this
one village so.
I'm kind of concerned there
fought what you expect of the
membership that is going to.
Be established whenever you do
have this rural opportunities
interim committee Mr speaker and
gentle lady.
There's a long standing
tradition of interim committees
in a in the state of New Mexico
that predate me.
I am really excited to learn I
am not presumptive in any way
that I will chair this committee
I'm hopeful Public that I might
participate in it because I feel
passionate.
There is a structure.
To how these committees work it
won't be any different it's not
recreating the wheel it's simply
for two years targeting the
focus with great love.
Deploying bright minds.
With common goals to solve the
challenges that rural New Mexico
faces.
The lady I yield back to.
Mr speaker like I said I think
your intent is good I think the
lack of detail in the financial
stress structure of this
particular bill leaves a lot to
be desired I realize that our
rural areas.
Sometimes of often get
overlooked because there are
more representation in the house
and Senate from the more
metropolitan areas than there
are from the urban areas and
Mister speaker the only way that
we're going to fix that is make
sure that our rural areas are
being Representative
Representative especially
whenever redistricting takes
place those people in our rural
areas desperately need
representation up here I know
that there is one particular
district that is comprised of
coming from Santa Fe and to
Torrance County all the way over
to Los Lunas back down to
Lincoln County and that is a
huge district.
The person that represents those
people down in southern Lincoln
County.
Have no idea of what their needs
are Mr speaker and that gives me
great concern Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Legislative Council Service be
required to staff this committee
as well during the interim Mr
speaker and gentle lady dancers
yes.
And I'm providing the funding to
that in.
Mr speaker.
Gentleman I appreciate the
answers you've given me not sure
that.
We might need to sit down and
have a talk about what you're
wanting to do here especially
whenever you have that named of
all these people that need to
serve on this committee to be
able to go to those particular
areas especially if there's no
funding if you're capital outlay
to Starkey use for this
particular purpose Mr speaker
gentleman thank you very much
appreciate your time there's
further debate the gentleman
from Lee Representative
Pettigrew.
Thank you Mr speaker does the
gentleman yield fruits.
Mr speaker I yield to the
gentleman from.
I'm not sure what county you're
from I apologize leak at eight
thank you Sir.
The John from Lee County.
Mr speaker and gentleman
I just wanted more of a
statement than a question I have
had to communities within my
district are.
Ceremony that
now do more uses both a
population density of zero per
square mile.
So I do hope to see
Results the that includes Lea
County in your discussions so I
do appreciate where you are
trying to do and I look forward
to seeing this is a progresses
thank you.
Are you but Mr speaker.
Mr speaker and kind gentleman
from Lee County thank you.
I think John is further debate
the gentleman from San Juan
Representative Montoya.
Thank you miss is a gentleman
from Rio Arriba yield.
Yes the gentleman yes I yield to
the gentleman from San Juan.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman so briefly when we
discussed your bill I understand
where this where where your
committee or where this
committee would be different is
it would focus on
infrastructure.
Whereas Mr speaker and gentleman
we have a water in Ag committee
that specifically looks at
natural resources water and
agricultural
Projects specifically and we
have a room a rural economic
development interim committee
that looks at bringing jobs to
local communities for the Mr
speaker and gentleman just to
cut to the chase am I correct in
understanding that what.
This committee over the next two
years and you the money that you
have used to fund out of your
junior money personally by the
way I think is very generous for
you to do that Mr speaker and
gentleman I understand the
difference is that your that
that your thought of this
committee is that it would be
looking at.
trying to solve some
infrastructure problems whether
it's
Broadband issues whether it's a
Our roads so water lines
in my correct in that
understanding Mr speaker and
gentleman from San Juan.
If I may as the body I don't
know if I'm out of line there's
a lot of talking and I really
wanted to focus on the
gentleman.
And it I'm having trouble
hearing so Mr speaker and
gentleman from someone the
answer to your question is
absolutely yes infrastructure is
key.
Whether it's broadband internet
waste water which is desperately
needed in my district alone it
is it is destitute it is an
emergency situation.
Roads infrastructure electricity
it will create jobs inherent in
infrastructure is the creation
of jobs so the answer short
answer is yes thanks for that Mr
speaker and gentleman to the
gentle lady
from Travis county.
I I think that that one of the
questions it does need to be
answered if this goes forward is
determining
who would serve.
What can communities
I think the concern is that
maybe.
People are not from rural
communities and up serving on
this committee I think that was
a concern of the gentle lady and
Mister speaker and gentleman I
think also the question as to
defining what rural would be
that would those are questions
that would have to be answered
is that if the governor signs
this and I believe that the the
speaker of the house and I
believe it's a pro tem of the
Senate if they just the under
with that understanding I think
would put people from rural
communities.
On the on the interim committee
Mr speaker and and and gentleman
there are there are some answers
we need to expand how we should
look at rural communities
I know that some of the schools
throughout rural communities are
on propane.
Which is very very very
expensive to run for heating and
so I think there's maybe some
public private partnerships that
you can look at I look forward
to supporting the your your the
bill and
it's a I think a fair risk on
your part to use your junior
money to fund it because if the
governor vetoes it that those
dollars go away so I I would
hope that that if if it passes
out that of the what you're
envisioning with this interim
committee is is what what
happens but I I would suggest as
to the gentle lady from Chavis
her points I think there needs
to be a little bit more
specificity and and more
parameters for of what what this
committee will do and and what
the scope of the work would be
so I thank you Mr speaker.
Thank you John there's further
debate the gentle lady from
Catherine Sikora in Valencia.
Representative Gail Armstrong.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
kind gentleman yield.
Yes I yield to the kind lady
from catching County.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentleman for bringing this
legislation forward I would be
the first to request to make a
request to the speaker of the
house to be on this committee I
do Mr speaker and kind gentlemen
Representative frontier.
New Mexico majority of my
district is Frontiere New Mexico
catching County seven thousand
square miles
and no stoplights.
Mr speaker kind gentleman and
I also represents an area that
is all volunteer fire
department.
Mr speaker and gentleman I also
represent an area that has no
hospice available in the county.
So I look forward to working
with you Mr speaker kind
gentleman I don't have any
questions I support your bill I
would be happy to
sit down and visit and talk
about the world that I'm from
that I was raised in Mr speaker
kind gentleman that I raise my
children in and now my
grandchildren are being raised
in and I look forward to working
with you thank you Mr speaker
intentional.
Mr speaker and lovely lady from
gentle lady from Catron can't
County.
It's way above my pay grade to
decide who would be on the
committee but if you were placed
on the committee and I was place
I would be delighted you are I
served with you on the on the
health and Human Services
Committee and it's been going.
I'd like to add that in the feet
bill chairwoman Lundstrom added
one hundred and fifty thousand
dollars to infrastructure.
Research.
Not only for this bill will be
applicables across the whole
school system good initiatives
that are in our hands at this
very time.
I commend that work and there is
momentum.
There is a focus there is a
desire to bring this really
needed work forward in a timely.
Elaborated.
Across the aisle bipartisan
focus for the betterment of this
beautiful state.
Thank you gentleman granting
generate next generation Santa
Fe Representative Lujan.
Thank you
Mr speaker with the gentleman
from this rural counties you.
Yes I yield to the the gentle
lady from Santa Fe.
Thank you
The comments about in support of
what you're doing and having
served on the interim committees
six different committees and
being a member on one economic
development interim committee.
I saw many bills.
For many pieces a discussions
about future bills and and
legislation in.
And presentations that crossed
over so many of the committees
with the same things.
This kind of information and
then you know getting getting my
legislation together and getting
in and following the legislation
as as where we are now.
I saw a lot of overlap I saw a
lot of.
Maybe information that wasn't
shared or.
Police you know discussed
between all those committees but
there was.
There was a lot of information
so.
I guess my question is to you
would use see this committee
that would if it's important
that would be able to bring a
lot of those discussions a lot
and a lot of those discussions
about rural communities special
about around broadband.
Particularly would you see this
committee as late as as a
resource or as a source that
would be able to bring out the
inner those ideas together so
that.
What is the different pieces of
moving information could be
brought together and that and
as.
The whole way.
Mr speaker.
Gentle lady to answer your
question I think you're getting
at the notion of collaboration.
Unification a diverse array of
folks at the table there's
sleeves rolled up doing the good
work.
As I mentioned a bit earlier
I've worked for thirty years in
this fashion I have a recipe in
a track record for really
driving community for the
greater good and and that's.
As a freshman that's how we base
this work I look at the
tremendous needs the daunting
needs of our state and I thought
it's about family fun media we
have to come together and do the
work I hope I answered your
question gentle lady from Santa
Fe.
Thank you Mr thank you Mr
speaker and gentleman yeah I
think that yes the the operative
word is what you sense
collaboration and where I see
this as being facilitator in
bringing this bringing all those
things together so that there's
a for discussion of what's going
on and our state is so huge and
there's so many so many moving
pieces and we are of all ensure
legislature and I think that
this is a something that I I
support and I ask you some of
these questions.
When you brought this this
legislation to me and asked me
to be to sign on to it which I
did and I fully supported
because having worked and
the majority of of my time in in
the congressional district three
which is sixteen out of our
thirty three counties the
majority of our thank you of of
the work that I've done over the
last ten years.
there isn't enough of
facilitative collaborative work
around these rural areas and and
I just want to say.
We have the experience that I've
had up to this point are there
still just the miss.
This
Mission and not a lot of
facilitative of work being done
and I I just commend you for for
bringing this forward and and to
take on you have to take this on
and I would urge you know
everyone else in their
colleagues tonight to vote for
this service supported as well
thank you Mr speaker and thank

Another one to do you know where
so we it does that the you know
we're at the heart of these that
digital communities that I
represent Mr speaker I ended
with.
Mr speaker and gentleman I don't
know every tiny town in our
beautiful state but I I know a
bunch and I believe that.
There is a commonality
regardless of what corner what
region we go throughout the
beautiful state of New Mexico
we're desperate need lives.
In every small frontier village
to the mid size and even the
larger even the urban centers
have a desperate need for the
the utility services outlined in
the bill.
Mr speaker and gentleman the
reason I mention some of these
places are in most of my
district is a non native lands
but most of the Navajo Nation
are you going to be reaching out
to the for the nation pueblos
and tribes with your with your
plans to go going to Schriever.
Mr speaker and kind gentleman
absolutely yes one of my part of
my district is in service of the
okay Wingate tribal community my
mother was born on the pueblo
because these I have a very
deep.
And heartfelt connection to our
tribal villages on our tribal
people in this beautiful state
so the question the answer to
your question is an absolute
yes.
Thank you for that Mister

question financial Mr speaker
have you been on into the
reservation and the Navajo
reservation.

relationships with those in
tribes across the entire state.
Mr speaker for young gentleman
the reason I'm asking about the
new generation have you been to
other reservation deepening the
reservation these people have
running water or electricity.
That that's my question to you
these people are in need and you
know a lot of people say Mr
speaker point and gentleman yeah
we've been to the reservation
because even though welcome
corner or of window rock that
kind of stuff but deep into the
reservation is what people do
not have in the running water
Nortel folds basically there is
there a rural country.
That's will the part of the
reason preservation talking
about Mr speaker and gentleman
have you been at that to see
these people we live.
Mr speaker and giant kind
gentleman.
The answer to your question is
really emblematic of how Covid
has outlined and highlighted
existing tragic deficiencies for
people I know how deeply the
Navajo Nation and other tribal
communities and immigrant
communities are suffering.
The answer to have I been in
deep into that problem is
honestly no.
But I understand.
Through empathy.
And being able to just.
Understand where our state is.
This bill was born the genesis
lives in service of those who
are absolutely desperate right
now.
Comment is asks us to wash your
hands some people don't have
water that comes out of the
faucet to wash their hands.
Kind gentleman I hope I answered
your question.

make sure that we reach out to
the people that are most in need
