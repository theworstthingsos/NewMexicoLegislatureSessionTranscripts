Action is sort of members please
turn your attention to
concurrence calendar number one.
The gentle lady from McKinley
and San Juan to make a motion.
Thank you Mr speaker and good
afternoon members I move that
the house concur in the Senate
amendments to house bill two and
there are three simple
amendments Mister speaker I'd
like to explain
two of them are language in
nature one times to the
energy minerals and natural
resources department what is
happening with the three point
five million and we identified
for or from Wells is that the
department asked for a change in
language and so the revision
would be.
To energy minerals and natural
resources department for orphan
and inactive Wells planning
identification and program
implementation regional bill
just said for planning and and
and the implementation.
A second language changes was
with the higher education
department if you recall we put
two million dollars for teacher
preparation affordability and
the language has been changed to
the teacher loan repayment fund
so it stays with higher ed
before it goes to a different
fund and the final change Mr
speaker and members he is a
reduction of twenty six million
dollars from the department of
information technology you may
recall that we had to twenty six
million out of the converted A.
R. PA state relieve and then
another hundred twenty three
point one million to the A. R.
P. A. capital
based on testimony by the
department of information
technology.
Apparently the stated they could
not use the twenty six million
at this time so.
Leave us to get into that and
and it was removed by Senate
finance so Mister speaker and
members those for the three
changes made to the bill.
There's a gentleman from Chavis
Eddy and Otero.
Thank you Mr speaker Lujan lady
of Mr speaker I'd be happy to
yield.
Of the lady can.
Can you help me with the new
language
And what does in act meaning.
In the.
In the secretaries of money
twenty estimate revision.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen I was not there Mr
speaker gentleman when this was
being discussed with Senate
finance it was just requested by
the department specifically that
it go for orphan and inactive
Wells planning identification
and program implementation.
The lady that
That causes me some fiber in
because I don't know what they
mean by it in the act.
could the.
Minerals at risk.
inactive
means is that means two weeks
two months or two years I don't
know but I know that that.
Being added by the secretary.
It's for a specific reason and
on ari and I certainly would
like to know what that is before
I vote if I could.
Gentleman generally if I may
this was presented by the
executive so that the
legislation before us tracks
identically with language in our
for.
This is the language that needs
to be in the bill so that we can
be guaranteed of our ability to
apply for the federal grant
funds.
Madam speaker and gentle lady is
it would it be fair to say.
That but you're telling me is
this.
New inactive terms will not
cause any hardship on the oil
and gas community
by setting any wells and are
having to plug those
prematurely.
Gentleman I can answer that for
search and there's no ability
whatsoever
if you this is about orphaned
wells.
Straight up so I mean if you if
you own a well and if you're
from the reports to keep well in
an active status.
Nothing in the laws this is a
change in the law on an active
wells is not changing a law that
is on the books for orphan wells
and all that this is just is
just language in an
appropriations bill so that we
can demonstrate to the federal
government the we're following
the federal law and can
therefore apply for grants.
Thank you gentle lady thank you
Sir.
Seeing no further debate.
Mr speaker of the generation
Chavis Mr speaker thank you very
much for the gentle lady please
I'd be happy to yield Mister
speaker.
Mr speaker gentle lady my
question to fall in front of
leader Townsend was talking
about the inactive wheels.
And I was not privy to any of
the changes that were made my
question I guess and I don't
know if anybody can interest is.
The small producers have a voice
in crafting this language that
is in the amendment.
Mr speaker gentle lady I would
assume they did not I mean I'm
just assuming that hi
understood that the hearings for
primarily for the agencies.
But I I don't know.
Mr speaker gentle lady that's my
concern
I understand what they want to
have happen but whenever we are
actually talking about because
it is the majors that.
I don't care what happens to
these smaller.
Sites and.
It is a small producers.
That are actively keeping them
going that also contributes to
the states.
State Land Office in particular
which does fund our schools our
hospitals our first responders
the list goes on and on and can
you tell me what the time frame
Mr speaker and gentle lady would
be because whenever you're
talking about program and
implementation in talking about
for what you need minerals
natural resources want to do it
gives me concern whenever there.
Not really side stating what the
time line might be on that.
Mr speaker gentle lady in the
original language on page two in
the bill line sixteen it says
three million.
Five hundred thousand dollars to
the energy minerals and natural
resources department for orphan
well planning and
implementation.
It's now been changed to energy
minerals and natural resources
department for orphan and
inactive well planning
identification and program
implementation so it sounds to
me like a lot of bureaucratic
language was added to this Mr
speaker gentle lady.
For the purposes of shoring up
that department to be able to be
able to apply for federal
dollars and Mr speaker gentle
lady I do understand that the
identification part of it is.
I guess I would like to see it a
little more.
As some clarifying terms there I
do understand what is going but
they're wanting to do that my
concern is that small producer
the Mr speaker gentle lady thank
you very much for your answers.
You're welcome.
Through the debate generally
Bernalillo Santa Fe Santa Fe.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
please yield be happy to yield
thank you I just have some
questions for clarification I'm
looking at this memorandum where
it says that.
Deleted the Senate deleted
twenty six million dollars in
appropriations.
Was someplace else or just
totally deleted out.
Mr speaker gentle lady it was
deleted okay thank you Mr
speaker gentlelady is there a
reason why the two because
there's a lot of really good
things in this bill or something
to give me some heartburn no
there's a reason why they didn't
just put that to from banks
because it seems like the five
million dollars is a very low
amount for food banks.
Mr speaker gentle lady I would
be of stress stretch to try to
explain what Senate finance does
so I don't think I could give
you a good answer gentle lady.
Thank you Mr speaker to
integrate replied in March over
there in asking for
clarification on that yeah this
is at the end of the that's one
of the things I look at it's
think the six lowest amount it
seems like it's too low the
disposition for COVID relief and
during this time seems like we
should put more money in that so
my other question Mr speaker
gentle lady should just as last
time for clarification I
apologize so the ten million
dollars for the department
transportation for the elector
vehicles who's going to maintain
that once we build those.
Maintains those charging
stations.
Mr speaker gentle lady
first I'd like to else's speaker
for clarification Mr speaker are
we going to go into the bill
again or we just going to talk
about the amendment so I I'm not
clear.
generally typically here here we
are going to keep the debate to
the amendments because we've
already had a full debate in
committee hearing on things that
are in the bill would not
discuss the amendment so it is
it is proper procedure on the
floor to keep questions focused
on the amendment.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
there was a mean thing I just I
looked at the well that would be
great to move that to the bank
because I know we have a lot of
needs with food issues in a
ranking for people who are not
good enough especially during
this time and I guess I would
say left on this is the only
thing which or something else we
could have done is something
that money around because one
now fifty one and education that
to me that such a huge
participate plans here in our
state is education crime and I
would like to sing something
that would address the crime
issue from the issues and moving
us from fifty first the ring so
thank you I appreciate your time
I know my time thank you for the
debate the gentleman from the
Representative Scott.
From his loan yield Mister
speaker I'd be happy to yield.
To the to
the teacher.
For.
Control is representative.
Mr speaker and gentleman it
would be far less than one
percent.
Mr speaker gentleman we do have
a fund already in place and the
plan would be to replenish it
when we get back into the thirty
day session we're trying to
capture additional dollars in
there so at this point be it
it's a very very small
percentage.
One now.
Mr speaker gentleman is because
we felt that due to trying to
recruit and retain teachers
those that do have
alone outstanding this would be
able to help retain the the
teachers in the school
districts.
Thank you for.
Provisions.
Is.
Treasury.
For.
Requests for language to match
for rural issues.
Mr speaker gentleman.
What house bill the house bill
two does is it moves money from
the treasury into our
appropriations contingency fund
once it's in the probation
contingency fund Mr speaker
gentleman the legislature then
has the ability to appropriate
so you're right it was in the
treasury but once we if this
bill passes and is signed into
law the money moves into another
fund with that we can
appropriate from.
John what was
we don't
over this money is spent over
the language that would be.
The expenditure.
Mr speaker gentle and that's
correct that's our job when we
get up here into the
appropriations process we will
identify the appropriate
programs and tied to that would
be the language.
Generated for your answers
welcome.
This further debate the gentle
lady from Eddie.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady please you'll be
happy to yield Mister speaker.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady so my question is about the
deletion of twenty six million
of million dollars from the
appropriation to the department
of information and technology.
A couple days ago I believe on a
bipartisan basis some members of
this body sent a letter to the
head of the broadband office
asking about some projects that
our schedule but not yet funded
is a rather lengthy list he
would address some of the
pockets of the state that are
vastly underserved with
broadband service and my
question is Mr speaker gentle
lady will the Senate amendments
to H. B. to jeopardize those
projects for funding or are they
are they already covered by what
the other appropriation amount
is thank you Mr speaker the
gentle lady it was actually my
recommendation that that letter
be drafted and that we have
bipartisan support to that
letter so I'm glad that it
happened I'm glad that it was
followed through by members of
the HFC Committee and others but
the plan is is to get that on
the right are Mr speaker gentle
lady for the to do it staff for
the purpose and when we come
into HSC we can ask where is
this these are projects that are
better we fully expect them to
be done.
But at this point it would be
covered by the remaining amount
of a hundred and twenty three
million.
Excellent news thank you Mr
speaker thank you gentle lady.
There's further debate the
gentleman from Chavis Lee and
Roosevelt.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Mr speaker I want to just go
back complaint could for second
talk about orphan well three and
a half million dollars.
My concern is this.
Thank you for oil or gas well in
the state of New Mexico can well
be a fully compliant.
Well in the ordinary course of
its producing lifetime.
Well it is a very different.
Type of non producing wells.
I'm worried that we may be
standing here today hearing aid
federal.
Directive come down and say to
me you can have an orphan well
anymore you can.
Unless you have an active wells
as well.
And because on any given day in
the state of New Mexico there
are many wells that are in and
an active status under.
Temporary.
Brandon why is that.
Because sometimes they're
waiting on a part.
In a supply chain that is
dysfunctional to get from where
average being produced two year
well had.
This is a
accepted in active status and
I'm very very concerned that we
may be imposing on layer of.
Open ended regulatory.
Process.
All and wells that are simply
waiting to be re.
Can their productive lives again
so madam chairman hi I'm.
The wilderness that.
This cannot be represents less
than one percent of the H. P.
two.
Why we can further address this
in January less than a month
away.
Question thank you Mr speaker
well gentlemen as you know we
can.
And the of when it comes time to
hear energy and minerals and
natural resources and we look at
this program there's nothing
that says that we can't look at
this again and I would ask Mr
speaker that you in particular
help the committee understand
the difference coming from your
background Mr speaker and
gentleman in your expertise you
and and some of the others on
the committee we look for some
help on that you folks are the
leaders in this industry.
We can when we get back into HSC
and we feel like maybe this is
an over reach we need to fix it.
Thank you madam for their
response and that will certainly
be an issue that we may or may
not the right address but I'm
afraid that we may be re
addressing and I will gladly
help that effort in January
thank you Mr speaker.
This for the residual from
Bernalillo Representative
remain.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady from grants shield
Mr speaker I certainly will Mr
speaker and gentle lady from
Gallup I'm sorry.
I wanted to repayment do they
need to work X. number of years
to satisfy the repayment.
Mr speaker and gentleman
actually grew up in the requests
for one area so you're not wrong
but I will ask my my experts
here if that's the case.
Mr speaker and gentleman of he's
finding out I'm not
expert in this program so I'm
not sure Mr speaker gentlemen if
you have to work so many years
to receive this repayment.
Okay Mr speaker and gentle woman
from Gallup I guess we'll just
wait for an answer but that's
that was my only question.
Seeing no further debate.

What going on twenty one years.
And I've been this will be my
third redistricting session and
I can tell you by far this is
been the most congenial it is
it's obvious that we have debate

about food away when it comes to
moving the agenda moving the New
Mexico house we are second to
none and I want to thank both of
you and I want to thank your

no thank you Mr speaker the
general.
Okay are there other answers.
Okay so.
there are three bills still
under consideration by this
legislature and this special
session.
they are house bill eleven the
medical malpractice act fix.
House bill eight which Rio
portions the districts of this
chamber and the Senate bill two
which reinforces the districts
of the state Senate.
All three of those bills are in
the Senate.
House Bill Levin has been
amended in the Senate Judiciary
Committee is is accepted as a.
More friendly than not to
mention that so we need to wait
for that bill to pass the house
and then take that upon
concurrence that of course is we
all know is a critical piece of
legislation to keep Health Care
flowing to patients on the first
of the year.
And then of course we need to
consider the Senate maps as well
there may be a concurrence on
house bill eight as well
apparently there is a language
that has just been changes that
rules committee relating not to
any district boundaries fifty
million to precinct splits I
don't know the details so
depending what happens there
there may be another concurrence
of.
So
Our plan is to recess subject to
the call of the chair the Senate
is planning to go back on their
floor at believed to this
afternoon so we'll keep an eye
on their progress it would be
nice if they could handle all
three of those bills today so
that we could then return later
this evening and dispose of all
three of those and be done today
I would like that to happen.
that is beyond my control
because it's up to have one the
debate the bills in the Senate
and New Mexico the Senate on one
of those bills so.
Unfortunately we need to.
And wait for them so I'd just
like to ask everyone since role
here together to be patient and
to
we provide a good book or
something to do this afternoon
because we we can't adjourn we
need to be here for those bills

Martinez leader Townsend all of
them know they can send messages
out to the to both caucuses in
the house that is that coming at
seven tonight where we would be
coming back tomorrow but we
won't know until later today and
this is entirely dependent on
the progress of the Senate side
