Gentlelady from Bernalillo.
Good morning Mr speaker good
morning members of the house Mr
speaker I move that we go to the
next order of business
announcements and miscellaneous
business your injection is
ordered.
Good morning members.
Are there any announcements the
gentleman from the.
Mr speaker.
Thank you Sir all rice with a
question.
And the question is will it be
the practice of the house in
this last twenty four hours of
our legislative session.
Not to announce the bills will
be heard until just as they come
on the floor for consideration
in the interest of the public
participation resume and and
full transparency it would be
most helpful since most of what
we're going to be hearing today
or Senate bills that many of our
members have not had much of a
chance to review.
It would be most helpful to have
at least a bit notice on the
upcoming pieces of legislation
we will be considering here
thank you Sir.
The gentleman that was three
times yesterday Mr leader
Townsend do we need three times
yesterday on those for today
that was three times we're
working on it will get your list
and some point if we can come up
with one I think that's the best
I can say we have headed and I I
think it's fair to say an
unprecedented level of headed
time notice in terms of what
those would be considered during
this session it's no secret I've
ever served under as
I had done so much in terms of
every day giving a list of bills
you the day before earlier in
the day we did that to think
it's good policy in the last
twenty four hours are always you
know difficult and we're going
to take requests from both sides
of the aisle in terms of bills
want to be prioritized heard we
will give priority to
concurrence because those are
house bill's neck and back over
so I want to make sure that as
we have members of both parties
and I believe we will have
members of both parties have
those coming back on
concurrence.
I think Representative Harper's
bill was just amended in the
Senate that's going to come back
over so we're going to make sure
that we get as much concurrence
taken care of as we can so it's
going to require all of us to be
a little flexible little patient
with one another but we'll do
the best we can in terms of
communicating with the floor
leaders what we're gonna be
taking up.
Other other announcements the
gentle lady from catches to
coral in Valencia thank you Mr
speaker I I rise as a state
representative for district
forty nine representing catching
County of seven thousand square
miles.
Largest county in the state.
And share my disappointment in
being on the board last night to
speak.
On Senate bill thirty two.
I'm being on the board early.
And.
Not being able to speak on that
bill.
Mr speaker members of the body.
There are so many stories that I
could have told you.
About how that's going to affect
my County one of my counties.
And how that's going to affect
New Mexico and I find it.
ironic that no one ever
mentioned that there is areas
that are closed to trapping Mr
speaker and body.
Including the Sandia ranger
district the organ mountains
portions of Los Alamos County
Santa Fe ski area tell ski area
and there's there's best
management practices.
There's also rules that you're
required to to Kerry a release
device there's also rules that
you have to check your traps
every twenty four hours.
And that was brought up.
My district is checker boarded
with private federal and state
land.
Landlocked.
State one is landlocked with
private property.
There's been industries and
catching County.
What was the largest.
County in the state for.
Logging in the eighties.
Shut down by the spotted owl.
So they said okay let's
diversify.
Hunting and and guiding
outfitting.
All know wait let's inter
reintroduce the wolf.
Okay well we'll trap we'll do
the best we can will we have our
act community.
All right let's ban trapping.
Mr speaker and body this is
going to be devastating for the
people in my community that make
a living doing this and it is I
find it insulting.
And for it to be the most rural
urban divide thing yet.
And Mr speaker body I just felt
the urge to make that statement.
Because I didn't have a chance
to speak last night I know there
are several that did get to
speak.
But as the representative of the
largest county in the state with
the most land mass and fewest
amount of people I didn't have a
chance to defend.
My constituents yes I have
constituents they wanted me to
vote for it but an overwhelming
majority wanted me to vote
against it.
Mr speaker and gentleman I also
find it insulting.
To insinuates for people in this
body to insinuate that something
that my community does is less
important.
Another community does.
I am very upset I left last
night.
Frankly.
Saying why am I even here.
But that is why I'm making this
statement this morning can I
appreciate the time thank you Mr
speaker the gentle lady next to
the gentleman from curry tobacco
what Lupe.
Roosevelt and San Miguel.
Mr speaker.
I also rise as to what happened.
Here in the chambers yesterday.
I was very disappointed when I
did not get to speak on an Ag
issue as you all know I'm a
farmer and rancher and I
represent the ag community.
I feel like I represent that
community in the state of New
Mexico not just in my district.
I understand that not everybody
gets to speak.
I understand that the clock runs
out.
But there are some issues that
didn't get brought up yesterday.
That I believe.
The people of the chambers of
the chamber here and and that
community.
Need to understand that we are
trying to represent him in the
best way we can.
The most effective affected
business in the state of New
Mexico by SB thirty two is
ranching and cattle business in
the state.
These people that are in the
cattle business and have land.
That lease state land and
federal lands.
Hey taxes they pay taxes on each
child that they own on each pair
that of cap cap pairs that they
don't.
On the bowl that they run with
the cows every.
Dollar every penny that they may
in the ranching business is
important it's a tough business.
In the state of New Mexico.
There's four hundred eighty
thousand cows.
That means of the four hundred
eighty thousand calves born at a
hundred percent right that's
hard to achieve anybody that has
ranch knows a.
If the calf is born and raised
to I. eight hundred fifty pounds
at today's market price on the
board.
It puts twelve hundred and forty
one dollars per head.
You do the math on that.
That's a lot of money for the
state of New Mexico for very
important business.
And one of their tolls got taken
away yesterday in this chamber.
We talked.
About trappers making two
hundred eighty five dollars off
their trapping.
Why did we not consider.
The ranching community and the
people that are striving to make
the state better by producing
be.
Some of the best quality beef in
the United States.
I believe that the Act community
gets left behind time after time
after time because they are a
minority in the sense.
The population of them doesn't
made up to the I. twenty five
corridor.
I believe.
That the act community of the
state of New Mexico auditor how
to have a chance to be heard
more times.
And have a fair chance at bills
like this.
We pleaded with you Mr speaker.
To be.
Heard in that bag.
Committee.
It didn't happen.
I believe.
That we can present.
Thanks to that community in
support of better than we have
in the past.
This is my second term here.
I've pushed hard.
In the ways that I know to
present a better.
And and seems like I get pushed
pushback pushback held down not
heard.
I hope in the future we can do
better for that community of the
state of New Mexico.
That's what I'm here to do.
That's not the only thing I'm
here to do but that's one of my
main.
Fortes and and and understanding
farming and agriculture.
And I hope and pray that in the
future it gets better thank you
Mr speaker.
The gentleman next to the
gentleman from Bernalillo

Thank you John the gentle lady

Mr speaker I move that we go to
the next order of business
concurrence.
You know just
Mr speaker Mr speaker I have my
hand looks for.
I did not recognize changes on
certain we're gonna get a
concurrence calendar.
Item number one gentle lady from
McKinley and San Juan
Representative Lundstrom are you
ready on concurrence item number
one.
Mr speaker I'm ready for
concurrence item number one get
me there.
gentlelady to make a motion Mr
house.
Right thank you Mr speaker
The motion is to concur with the
Senate amendments to house
appropriations and finance
committee.
I am asking the body to vote yes
on concurrence.
The gentle lady to explain the
Senate amendments thank you Mr
speaker and thank you body of
the Senate finance amendments to
house appropriations and finance
committee I felt Mr speaker and
and members were very reasonable
what they did is they added
forty one million dollars to the
FY twenty two reoccurring
general fund appropriation
mostly of that was for a one
percent employer contribution
increased to the education
retirement fund pursuant to the
passage of yes the forty two.
the amendments also added
Funding for.
State agencies Mr speaker the
state agencies was about the
amount of twelve million those
for agencies that
we didn't necessarily pick up in
the HFC process that needed a
little extra help Mr speaker and
members so we what we've done is
we've provided information to
all the members on the floor you
should have the key issues that
highlight in front of you you
should also have the
The updated general fund
financial summering.
The most updated financial
summary would be March fifteenth
twenty twenty one
and what that does is it updates
everything that has been done to
date if you look at the estimate
for FY twenty two we still
maintain a reserve for
reoccurring probation at twenty
three point eight percent.
And Mr speaker we also had
notice that of the Senate
finance committee had done some
work in court involving a
federal appropriation.
What they've done with that is
something Mr speaker HFC had had
the opportunity we would have
done the same thing.
And that is is to move the state
President Biden funding into the
appropriations act to be spread
to the appropriate agencies for
years so with that Mr speaker
and members I'd be happy to
answer any questions that any of
us any of the folks may have
this morning.
There is a difference.
The general percent of all
Representative Harper.
Thank you Mr speaker the kind
and gentle lady from McKinley
he'll and it be happy to yield
Mister speaker.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady.
I I I have a handful of
questions just to make sure we
understand.
What happened to the budget in
the Senate and and really
speaker gentle lady we had a
great conversation on the house
floor when House Bill to
laughter Committee.
And I I I supported
that bill I saw that your
committee did an amazing job.
but I'd like to just make sure
that
we all understand
what the Senate did.
so that perhaps we can make a
really good decision here on
concurrence.
the speaker and generally so the
first first question is of
course.
The.
Legislative finance committee
budget recommendation was a four
point two percent increase in
recurring spending.
And then in the house so we did
a an amazing job of being a a
disciplined and and and spending
and we we only increase the to a
four point seven percent.
reoccurring over the last FY
levels with the Senate changes
what is the current.
percent of increases or of
reoccurring.
expenses thank you Mr speaker
thank you gentlemen here are
correct when the bill left HSC
the spending increase was four
point seven in the Senate
increased to five point four so
in terms Mr speaker and
gentleman of real money that's
the forty million dollars I
discussed of which most of that
was thirty four million for the
E. R. B. fund and then twelve
for the agency.
Yeah Mr speaker and enjoy thank
you that your.
Yeah so that's a city south of
you and and drilling down your
user dissipated might my next
question so we we did increase
spending in the Senate from four
point seven to five point four
so as of now roughly another
point seven percent increase.
Mr July you know that I've.
Look at the last thirty years of
budget appropriations and on the
mass and the safe numbers really
just shy of four percent to
raise.
so so now here we're pushing
five point three which makes me
a little uncomfortable but I
want to talk about what these
increases are.
Miss you so the if if I heard
you right Sir total new amount
of.
returning spending that the
Senate added.
was about seventy eight million
about eighty million dollars is.
Is that correct when you look at
I'm trying and nonrecurring all
right Mr speaker gentle money in
terms of the reoccurring and now
it's forty one million.
we can wait we can talk about
the non reoccurring pace also.
In terms of the section for
reoccurring patients forty one
million yeah Mister jelly thank
you yes so.
So the the reoccurring spend of
the the forty one million could
you just break down.
will we'll do that first and I
will come back to the the
nonrecurring.
All right thank you Mr speaker
thank you gentlemen of.
It's the important cases under
section four of the of the bill
and if you look at those general
fund reoccurring amount to be
things like of funding going to
the AOC that was three hundred
and fifty thousand dollars for
evidence based pre trial pre
trial services are there is a
small amount of a hundred
thousand dollars for the second
District Court and that was for
new judgeships we did put
funding in excuse me the Senate
put funding into the dust that
was a hundred ninety thousand.
The in that particular case Mr
speaker and gentleman that is
something that we shared with
HSC many times in committee
you'll hear let's let the Senate
do the rest or do the other
half.
Are we put some in the public
defenders or those Senate debt
that was half a million and that
was for contract attorneys in
rural areas Mr speaker and
gentleman there is also a fifty
thousand dollar appropriation
and it's under the DFA specials
it increased leaseholders
systems preparation
do it for contract
cybersecurity in the amount of
four hundred thousand.
The secretary of state also was
happened million for elections
program at the spaceport was two
hundred fifty thousand.
Cultural affairs was four
hundred thousand energy minerals
and natural resources two
hundred thousand.
the ageing Department was four
hundred thirty three thousand
division of vocational rehab
ninety two thousand.
The environment department for a
new ocean programs five hundred
thousand CYFD was six hundred
thousand.
Corrections department was a
hundred fifty six thousand
homeland security a hundred
sixty four the public education
department received another six
hundred ninety two thousand and
that was for food and nutrition
programs
higher ed was two hundred fifty
thousand both New Mexico state
and UNM was five hundred
thousand I was reading regarding
health leg programs.
And and as well as eastern and
western New Mexico.
The big piece Mr speaker and
gentleman was under section
eight compensation and that was
the retirement contribution for
thirty four million so Mr
speaker gentle and that kind of
in a nutshell is so the
reoccurring expenses that the
Senate and put in.
Mr speaker.
Analysts
response I think yeah actually
very beautifully made the next
point which was.
That really all this reoccurring
spending that was added was
really not.
You know point big projects
that's the governor wanted to
fund it really was.
sprinkling us I guess relatively
small dollars across many
different agencies.
Mr generally I think it was
roughly twelve million dollars
if I'm remembering right across
all the different agencies Mr
delay this essentially brings
those agencies budgets flat is
that correct.
Mr speaker gentlemen yes in many
cases there was a little
tweaking and some of them but
generally that would be correct.
Speaker and gentle lady and her
madam speaker and gentle lady
Because if I remember right the
LFC rack in many cases actually
recommended to a small one or
two percent decrease because
agencies receive such big
increases of our budget and
we're not always able to spend
down all that money it was
unfair to perhaps remove one or
two percent to my also
remembering that correctly.
Yes Mr speaker excuse me madam
speaker yes that's corrected you
might remember also gentleman
that at one point last summer
the governor had also asked the
agencies to cut the
their agency budget spike five
percent and so we've done some
recalibrating that wasn't
necessary now with the new money
coming in that would be quite
that do.
Yes thank you Mr speaker and
generally so so it's a big part
of the reoccurring that was
added I'm twelve million
reoccurring was all these these
agencies and and.
And all college you know
different different state
agencies but the big one I I
believe speaker gentle you
mentioned thirty four million
for ERP it is that correct.
Yes
Mr speaker Madam speaker
gentleman.
Madam speaker
of gentle lady I I actually
think this is a really wise move
hi
yes I'm looking at okay we're
going to be spending a little
bit more as in I'm comfortable
with where is that money going
and and here were by putting it
into the E. R. B. or or
essentially buying down unfunded
liability and putting us in a
better position
for making those those promises
they can was distributions.
Into the future and by it by
making small steps like this now
I'm making it reoccurring.
that's that's actually something
I can support Mister speaker
July could you share your
thoughts on that.
Mr menace Baker gentleman yes I
agree with the comments that you
made we had
compelling discussions about
that that component is that the
Feds left HM State are we did
not have that included at the
time but it is true there is a
actuarial report in regard to
the ERP fund and we do need to
help sure that fund up many
people that are going to be
relying on that on that pension
program and I I just believe
that that we have the funding
let's go ahead and and try to
help.
I thank you Mr speaker and madam
speaker and gentle lady I
appreciate that and then maybe
one other sites before we go to
the nonrecurring.
so my my understanding is really
of this five point four percent
spending increase.
Portion of that
it is going into a very modest
pay increase
Mr jelly were talking like maybe
a one percent of this increase
has to do with with the rate
increases and I'm remembering
understand that correctly.
Madam speaker gentleman yes it's
a very modest pay increase I
think the total cost to the
general fund was sixty four
million
so it's very modest when you
think about all the people that
would receive this.
Yeah
and and gentle lady
I think that's also something
I'm comfortable supporting we've
we've had many many years were
state employees did not receive
any increases we know that of
course inflation has existed not
perhaps to as high as extent is
historically part in the past
but but we do understand that is
costs.
increases just for living and
then also benefit costs
increased we want to want to do
our best to make sure that our
arms our state employees are
actually losing buying power
over the years so I've.
I I stick I can also support
this modest pay increase.
So Mister generation we we then
shift over to the nonrecurring
portion could you.
Talk about that amount and and
maybe to break down.
Thank happy to madam speaker
gentleman's under the
nonrecurring appropriation
summary.
There is funding
For several different things and
the total that I have and Madam
speaker and gentleman everyone
should have this copy on their
on their basket that would be
sections nine and ten
In the US but we.
We do have under the department
of finance and administration
the Senate had added two million
dollars for financial assistance
to local governments in
northwest New Mexico that
experienced extraordinary costs
associated with COVID nineteen
public health emergency.
There was one million dollars of
General Services Department for
group health shortfall.
General Services Department
seven hundred fifty thousand for
being local replacement.
The tourism department hundred
thousand for the New Mexico
bowl.
The tourism department received
an additional two million for
marketing and advertising
Madam speaker gentleman we
originally from HSA put in five
million.
Human Services an additional
five million for COVID relief
payments for people not
qualifying for federal stimulus
project.
At
went through the list here we
have data.
Funding in higher.
Education department or a Levin
million and this is the Senate
had included opportunity
scholarship money
also under higher education the
Senate had added ten million
five hundred dollars for the
lottery to get up to a ninety
percent of tuition.
That subtotal is thirty two
million.
There's also funding in higher
education endowment fund for
five million.
Up and that is what I've seen
madam speaker gentleman for of
non reoccurring that came out of
the Senate finance committee.
Now Mr speaker and gentle lady
thank you yeah that's.
Yeah when you look at the thirty
two million and nonrecurring.
I think roughly two thirds of
that then is the opportunity
scholarship and money to the
lottery scholarship Mr Julius is
that right.
Madam speaker gentleman that is
correct.
so
Speaker gentle lady so we have
roughly you know ten a little
less than ten million that's
kind of sprinkled out on other
little projects I you know I
don't agree with all of them but
okay that's that's fine.
Mr speaker gentle lady just
talking about the property
starship in the lottery
scholarship.
You know I I can understand why
folks are excited about signing
those.
And and I'll tell you
I'm I'm not really excited about
funding these
speaker and gentle lady and and
this goes back to you know nine
years ago when we had that
crisis with a lottery
scholarship when we had to break
away from tuition because we
couldn't find one hundred
percent of tuition anymore
because you know we all know
that of the cost of college the
attendance intuition has grown
much faster than the rate of
inflation much much faster.
And the revenues are getting
from the lottery or or socially
flat rate essentially saturated
the market and an officially the
we we we had a great promise to
many students wanting to go to
college.
And the costs of colleges
increasing so much faster than
the water to keep up with.
Mr jelly we made the hard
decision to follow what other
states do I think we were the
only states that matched a
tuition hundred percent was a
lottery program we decided we're
going to we're gonna break from
tuition and we're just gonna
give everyone.
What's available and I think I
remember you're right right now
it's about two thousand two
hundred dollars a semester is
what's available which is huge
and that's that's still like
seventy percent of tuition for
most rate percent tuition for
most colleges and universities.
and and then speaker gentle lady
I I just really don't feel when
the lottery scholarship was
started it was never intended I
think was even vocally said that
was not the taxpayer dollars is
going to it.
Mr gently improve my remembering
that correctly.
Thank you madam speaker
gentleman's I do remember that
kind of discussion it's all
supposed to be based I believe
on scratchers that are sold help
support that.
The speaker and gentle lady.
So and of course we over the
years when the water has been in
trouble we have put taxpayer
dollars into that fund we were
trying to give people a soft
landing at first and then
reflect with cash to settle
let's let's bump it up because
that's yeah that's a great thing
to go home and say I hope to you
know pay for your kids college
even though that's probably not
a wise use of taxpayer dollars
because we just get ourselves in
that situation again we're going
to be.
You know with with this
increased I think we're gonna
close to ninety percent of
tuition being covered.
And now we're gonna be in the
same boat again when when things
are hard we're not able to fund
it.
You know that's gonna come
crashing back down and will who
is just this roller coaster and
I I wish you would just pick
one.
the speaker and madam speaker
gentle lady.
but that said.
that twenty million dollars
twenty two million dollars out
of almost eight billion dollar
budget you know I can get upset
about that
but I really feel like you're
committee
and and Mr have you know FC and
the Senate have done a very good
job.
Putting this together
and and even though I'm a little
uncomfortable with the five
point four percent I was more
comfortable with the you know
four point seven or even a four
point two.
I also understand that the
pressures and and the needs to
do some some good things.
So I just Madam speaker gentle
lady I just want to say thank
you and I want to say that I am
going to vote to concur.
With these changes and I'm gonna
support house bill two and this
is the first time I've done it a
long time and I just want to say
that I'm very grateful for your
your your trade hard work the
committee's hard work the
staff's hard work and I just
want to encourage the body here
even though five point four is a
little high.
that this is what I consider a
good compromise place to be and
I encourage everyone to vote yes
on contracts thank you madam
speaker thank you generally.
The gentleman from Lee County
Representative Scott.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentle lady from San Juan
McKinley yield.
Madam speaker I'd be happy to
yield.
Looking through these.
One budget.
Information I tend to focus
first on.
The elephants in the room.
And.
Clearly public education is one
of those we're spending is
scheduled to are projected to
increase by approximately six
percent.
For.
Was it a hundred and eighty
million dollars.
The same time.
The.
This appears to be some fairly
significant resources from the
federal stimulus programs
already approved and the federal
stimulus programs that were that
were just just last week or so
approved and could you.
Madam speaker gentle lady could
you explain how all.
Increase in funding will
counteract if you if you could
with all of this new money
coming in from the federal
stimulus programs.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen I think that's an
excellent question and certainly
as I mentioned earlier Madam
speaker and gentlemen yeah HFC
what have the opportunity to
move the federal funds into the
appropriations account we would
have done the same thing the
Senate did we firmly believe
that it's our responsibility to
be the appropriators.
Last year there was funding that
was provided to public education
under the cares Act
there's also funding that's
going to be provided through the
new I didn't stimulus program.
so what we have are some major
major sources of funding that
are coming in.
emergency
excuse me for K. twelve we're
looking at New Mexico receiving
and
in millions a hundred and eight
million.
That's under the cares Act.
And under the omnibus C. C.
eight CC eight act it is four
hundred and thirty five million
and then under the estimated by
the stimulus we anticipate over
a billion dollars.
much of this money goes directly
into the state agency and into
the school districts.
Are they have
Regulation in which where they
have to spend the funding
not all that has been shared yet
with the debate federal
department of treasury but we
anticipate a.
Substantial amount of funding to
help shore up our education
system.
Our budget and the budget that
Senate finances put for is it
regard to our general fund
budgeting and some other other
funds we continue our budgeting
process which general fund and
the SCG regardless if we get
federal money we we don't know
where we're gonna get federal
money in this way we're happy
that it's happened that is
happening but what you're going
to see is increases regarding
the general fund.
And once we get into the inner
process madam speaker and
gentleman or we can actually see
how this is been used with the
frontier codes look like we're
gonna have a better report for
you next January.
Madam speaker gentle lady this
looks like.
One point five billion dollar.
Shot in the arm if you will.
Thank you Mr.
Three point two billion in the
SCG.
I will choose to.
Opinion for state appropriators
to schools.
We'll be able to effectively and
efficiently of swore.
This level of funding increase
that's sounds to me like.
Huge volume of dollars.
Madam speaker gentleman that's
exactly correct I think with the
to interim oversight committees
LFC and L. E. S. C. we would
have our legislative
responsibility to in essence
watching like a hawk to make
sure that the the spending make
sense
that the policy is in place that
would be the L. E. S. C.
committee role is to make sure
that certain policies are being
followed correctly and then LFC
would be basically watching the
bank account.
Speaker gentle lady I suppose
the same question would apply to
higher ed can you tell me what
House Appropriations stood and
what kind of increased they can
expect from the federal stimulus
program.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen for within the
higher ed budget of both with
HSC and Senate finance we have
we work with the funding formula
but what we have for higher ed
institutions madam speaker and
gentleman it is or under the
cares program was sixty million.
Under the CCA all of us was
eighty four point six million
and we anticipate with this
biting stimulus program one
hundred and fifty eight million
and that would be distributed
directly to the higher ed
institutions.
Yes.
Madam speaker and gentle lady I
believe the Senate version of.
Of house bill two came across
with some additional spending
over and above what was approved
by the house could you explain
why we're doing that.
Thank you madam speaker
gentlemen you're right there to
put some general fund and
athletics those were fairly
small amounts
there is also some funding
That I'm looking now at my high
level Madam speaker gentleman on
what we actually did with higher
at there I NG a received a small
bomb of the six hundred and
eighty thousand
that but that's distributed by
formula to that to the different
institutions get out some and I
and I think where it's most this
is with this mention with the
previous Representative is with
the scholarship programs.
Even though it's not a direct
appropriation to hire and they
would be the recipients of the
opportunity scholarship as well
as the lottery scholarship.
Thank you for that Madam speaker
and gentle lady.
A very brief conversation about
health the cost of college
attendance war.
Increasing rapidly do you have
any percentage numbers year over
year from all for the last two
or three years that could
address that concern.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman actually what we're
seeing is a very deep decline in
enrollment over this last year
And we of course we.
Contribute that to the pandemic
of.
We're going to madam speaker
gentle Ben when we say this
decline in or enrollment because
it is a funding formula based
distribution of you're gonna say
some of the schools that are
going to be in top shape
if if we don't help shore that
up they still have the same
costs Madam speaker and
gentleman when it comes to
facility maintenance and
personnel and just re
calibrating into a virtual world
I've had many discussions madam
speaker and gentleman with the
presidents of the various
colleges as it explained what
they've tried to do to cut costs
so are we can provide that
information to you I'm having
the staff look for it now but we
definitely have to have to take
into consideration.
what the impact is down with the
rules meant the dropping and
cost still going up.
So the tuition history madam
speaker and gentleman is and
for FY twenty for undergraduate
students if spam an average
tuition increase of four point
one percent and for the two year
institutions it's about two
point two percent.
So madam speaker gentle lady
with the number of students to
climbing and the revenue levels.
The constant or increasing the
cost per student would in fact
be going up at a fairly
significant clip is that
accurate and can you find the
time for.
Mr speaker madam speaker
gentleman that's right it's a
little counter intuitive to
think that it wouldn't go up but
there has been substantial
increases for some of the
institutions with the decline in
enrollment.
and it gets back to making sure
that.
Not only the decline enrollment
but the increased need for
telecommunications capability.
Many of the schools particularly
the more rural areas where you
have branch colleges may not
have the telecommunications
capabilities so that all has to
be built up
And let's see what to see if the
staff is found that number for
you they're looking I can get
back to you if you want to
continue with some other
questions.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady so looking forward looking
down the road to a more virtual
world.
Well would not be reasonable for
us to assume that there would be
increased efficiencies there
that is the cost to educate a
student a cost to give.
Classroom instruction virtually
would.
After the infrastructure is
built out would actually be less
is that.
A very reasonable track.
On madam speaker gentle but it
is certainly for me and one that
I've asked them to work on
our commitment for the scanner
with the LESC committee is to
actually re evaluate and re work
the higher ed funding formula
based on exactly what you're
talking about.
There's been questions madam
speaker and gentlemen about what
is the true cost if it's not in
person our education is it is
the wall or is it less expensive
or more expensive and I think
for this first trial here in
hearing the testimony last
summer it's been more expensive
because nobody ever anticipated
we're not going to be in the
classroom nobody anticipated
that was all going to have to be
virtually delivered that's and
that's hard to do.
Thank you for.
Madam speaker gentle lady of
because of turn more questions
but I know there are other
people in the board just.
Couple of more items I noticed
at the department of cultural
affairs got a good bump in the
Senate version of the bill which
was not included in the house
version could you go over for
the thought process was there
please.
I I will madam speaker gentlemen
I understand that part of that
was tied to the fact that
there's no revenue coming in
when places are closed down.
And all this did did was bring
them to a flat budget madam
speaker gentlemen what.
When they have to close those
facilities there's no revenue
coming in but yet facilities
don't have to be maintained some
people are paid.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you journalists are concerned
question with respect to the
department of the environment.
Thank you madam speaker
gentleman the Department
environment one
one area that I was particularly
interested in is to make sure
that there was funding for the
oil conservation group they
needed more help in there and
and that and I know they're
under natural resources but
there is collaboration
Madam speaker and gentleman with
how these agencies work and.
What is happening at least in
this pandemic there was a
tremendous amount of new
responsibility that fell on the
environment department that they
hadn't anticipated
primarily with their regulatory
duties so I agree Madam speaker
gentleman there was quite a big
bump to the environment
department we're gonna be
looking for good things out of
them when we when we get in
front of the committee this next
summer.
Thank you.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
and would you address all
funding for law enforcement in
the upcoming budget.
thank you Madam speaker
gentleman in the law enforcement
budget when we're looking at the
department of public safety.
There was an increase here
and that would be agency code
seven ninety of a hundred and
twenty eight
million in terms of the of the.
The Senate finance.
Excuse me thousand on here and
some of that is just because
they need they need the
assistance needed that that the
a little bump in we had a very
good hearing with madam speaker
gentlemen with public safety you
know we had to do a little extra
here during this up pandemic
with them and we just felt like
that hundred twenty eight
thousand bump wasn't wasn't
quite a big deal.
And it just brings it up to a
flat budget madam speaker.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
this will be my last question.
But it's usually all right.
Appropriated one point six
billion dollars that was not
included in the house budget.
For.
Of various programs and
projects.
From the federal stimulus.
Yes
What happens there gentlelady.
It's a good point madam speaker
gentleman's they did they took
the one point six billion of
federal stimulus and it was put
into debt for different sections
of the budget and as I mentioned
earlier Madam is we would have
had that opportunity we would
have done the same thing
what what happened is the
funding became available within
section five of the budget.
There's fifty million dollars
available for Medicaid
in section nine additional
funding for the state road fund
funding also for Law replace of
lost revenue due to the COVID
nineteen that would have gone in
to DFA for parks because these
things were closed also
do what there is funding for the
back fill we want to make sure
we're using federal funds as
opposed to general fund for do
it when it comes to broadband
there were six hundred million
put into the you live program
for the up workforce solutions
department and also a small
amount for case management.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady so can you give
me the percentage of this is one
time money we don't expect this
to be coming in every year or
every other year reason efforts
I can you tell me how much of
these funds will be expanded
recurring and health much will
be spent in no one time
projects.
Thank you madam speaker
gentleman you're correct this is
one time
the way the Senate had sent this
so the these expenditures up
they make sense for one time
expenditures and I would say
just reviewing the list again
it's for back filling it's for
replacing a general fund and for
things like.
Broadband as an example it you
know that is a one time
expenditure when you're looking
at the U. Y. Fund we're repaying
of federal you lied loan and
making sure that there's enough
funded funding in the trust fund
so businesses are increase their
fees are increased
and they're also and the speaker
gentleman there was four hundred
and eighty three million dollars
available
Or the governor then to decide
is our other areas that might
need some shoring up but this is
not what you would be considered
a section for reoccurring come
out.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady last question I
promised to public employees
retirement fund for the
educational retirement fund
which or so under water get any
additional of revenues out of
this when full.
Madam speaker gentleman no.
Madam speaker gentle lady I'll
leave it at that.
Thank you very much that
concludes my questions.
The gentle lady from Bernalillo
Santa and Santa Fe
Representative Lord.
Thank you madam speaker will
speaker will the gentle lady
please yield.
I'd be happy to yield Madam
speaker.
Okay.
What's the most frustrating
things ever about being a
freshman.
When we get these generous bills
I want everyone to see at home
we get these generous pieces of
paper.
And then we get it goes to the
Senate and we have all these new
summaries and we're supposed to
go through this in three hours
and then vote for the people.
It's almost impossible it is
frustrating for me to no end.
So would you please go through
this summary of Senate bill that
was passed and house bill two

like one two three four five six
seven eight.
Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
fourteen fifteen different

Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady just for the benefit
of the public of course all of
the HSC meetings are open to the
public every agency just heard

to talk about these things as a
committee and what I'm gonna do
for you madam speaker gentle
lady's I'm gonna talk to you
about what it what agency are

total of the seven point three
billion dollars so how much.
millions I'm I read the wrong
line here so this is all in
millions so at the end of the
day we've got seven point three
billion dollar budget so I would
help me madam speaker if the
representative could tell me
what page she's speaking from
that's helpful for me we did the
when we have staff house bill
two we did have a index of it's
different now we apologize I'm
not sure we got a Senate index
passed out the staff shaking
their head we did not and I
apologize for that it is hard to
track this is a big bill but if
there's some specifics I'm happy
to answer well.
Thank you so much Madam speaker
and thank you so much gentle
lady for going through all that
I I greatly appreciated and I'm
not angry with you or anybody
and angry at the situation
assistance very frustrated I'm
trying to represent the people
in my district and I and I like
to go through every single bill
with a fine tooth comb so they
know what I am voting on and
it's so hard when I get this put
in front of me and I'm like oh I
got here and this changed and
this changed.
Right so my next question is
that list that you got through
that you went through I do have
that here gentle lady is
available online and can you let
the people know what they can
find this place.
Yes madam speaker gentle lady
it's on the LESC website the
entire package of that hopefully
everybody had received about a
speaker gentle lady this general
fund high level appropriations
summary is on there as well as
everything that has been
discussed this morning.
Thank you madam speaker and
think of gentle lady for
explained I just want to make
sure that everybody.
From because the new as a
freshman it's still you know
fresh in my mind how frustrated
could be as a constituent and
not understanding the process
and and where to find things and
I know a lot of my constituents
are angry they can't be here and
they can be part of the process
and some people can't log into
zoom at least I can still get to
the website so I I did have
another question on this please
You said that there was a Leo
are law enforcement budget that
was increase in that you had
spoken to law enforcement.
Can you tell me which law
enforcement you spoke to and you
don't have to give specific
names but if you spoke to
organizations did you speak to
specific law enforcement
officers were all the leos
involve meeting place officer
shares just just so we can be
clear on who was brought to the
table on this please thank you.
Thank you madam speaker and for
the gentle lady's background
we're building a state budget
we're not building budgets for
local governments so the only
department that would have been
brought forward is the state of
public safety department that
state police basically
so very are the agents say that
we would work directly with for
all the rest of them those would
that's a different process this
budget only ties to state
agencies.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you for the clarification on
that so just to follow up with
that gentle lady so what you're
saying is that.
Some state police were involved
or was the state police
association were they involved
in this process.
madam speaker gentle lady the
way this works is that we are
one of few states in the country
that actually has a two budget
process the legislative budget
process works through the
legislative finance committee
throughout the inner and then
the governor house for own
budgets process which is the
department of finance
administration so what we can
then in January to start
building the budget we have what
are called high level
spreadsheets different sheets
we've got the DFA request and
then we've got the legislative
request in our committee hears
this we take testimony and
hearing from they the department
of public safety the cabinet
secretary all there
administrative staff and they
represent the department they
represent what those cost
estimates are what their needs
are in person so it's all about
the cabinet secretary for the
department of public safety that
we work with.
Thank you madam speaker
gentleman's so you say you said
it was the cabinet secretary
that is a person so I'm assuming
then that person then talks to
the state police and then talks
to the state police association.
Excuse me madam speaker gentle
lady.
The state police work for the
cabinet secretary the state
police is one division under the
department of public safety.
There's a motor transmission I'm
trying to recall no I don't have
it all right in front of me but
all these people actually work
for the cabinet secretary so
their budgets are represented by
the cabinet secretary as they
come before HSC and Senate
finance.
Thank you so much madam speaker
gentle lady reason assets
because so many times I know
that the law enforcement
officers get left out of their
budget and I feel like they
would have the best input on
that so I will do some follow up
on that since I do have some
contacts that I could talk to
make sure that their voices were
heard and thank you so much for
your time thank you the gentle
lady thank you madam speaker for
allowing me to speak and I yield
my time.
Gentleman from curry county
Representative Crowder.
Thank you madam speaker will
madam chair from the Killian's
Santa please you.
Thank you madam speaker I will
yield is not sound of all it.
One thank you.
My apologies madam chair I I was
thinking of my college that got
up and spoke a little bit ago
and and I know he's from Santa
and and most of my questions the
us before I had an opportunity
so I had sent of all my money I
apologize.
Madam speaker madam chair I want
to start on the key hearing
issues on the on the first page.
On the third paragraph down.
When I read that I I jumped to
the inner this conclusion it is
says assuming passage of revenue
measures detailed on the
attachment.
And I think what clicked in my
mind is is assuming passage of
revenue enhancements but it
doesn't say that this is revenue
measures.
And so I I thought initially
that was probably talking about
house bill two ninety one or
something like that that was
going to enhance revenue it does
not.
But when I went back to page
three
I I found the revenue measures
there were spoke enough.
And it's a kind of ring a bell
with me madam chair.
Repeatedly on the on the house
floor we have tried to point out
any of the bills that come
through the the house floor that
have not gone do House
Appropriations finance but they
have a financial impact.
And so gentle lady when I read
the paragraph on page one and I
look at the language on page
three it talks about
Under recurring revenue the
twenty twenty one recurring
revenue legislation bills passed
water both were start about one
house for both houses in in
under nonrecurring there's
another one it's talks about.
Nonrecurring left Revenue
legislation so my question
gentle lady and and
Your analyst.
All the bills that have come
across the floor that had the
appropriation or financial
impact is that we're.
Those bills are being picked up
and addressed within the budget
all on the reserve portion this
is our reserve she basically but
is that we're LFC or or House
Appropriations someone is
picking those the impact of
those bills.
And and putting them into the
process of my reading this right
gentlelady
Madam speaker gentleman yes
you're reading a ride as you
look at the appropriation
account detail you'll see that
others call so under FY twenty
two for recurring and non
recurring.
They also for some of our in out
years but yes that's that's what
we're talking about thank you
gentle lady and and I know your
expertise there where do I get a
glimpse of him every now and
then the lady can you tell me
just two or three of the bills
that that have because those
negative impacts I was surprised
I was looking for a positive
impact of the budget and it
winds up that these are all
negative impacts.
I know that one of the bills I
thought would have a huge impact
was the cannabis field but I
don't believe that's true I
think it actually cost us money
instead of generating revenue
it's going to cost us the first
year is that correct
madam chairman speaker.
I thank you
G. madam speaker what I'm
looking at and I'm looking at
twenty two FY twenty two under
reoccurring and what we have
And we're looking at house bill
twelve as it was originally
dropped which of course things
have changed as my
understanding.
And the best test was five point
two million on that to the good
the positive it doesn't.
Then that we're not gonna have
to go back and re re evaluate
this based on what the final
outcome of that bill is but when
you look at some of those things
that would be a negative to the
general fund that are under
reoccurring.
It's things like sustainable
building tax credit.
The
I'm looking at
There's one here for the fire
protection grant changes.
That's a pretty good size one
that was that nineteen million
and what happens with some of
these bills.
If we allow for a non reverting
language that means general fund
never gets together you know we
don't get to work with that just
as we would but there are some
here
I think it's energy storage
system tax credit five million
things like that but the big one
that I'm looking out for this
next year is the fire protection
grant changes and.
Your.
Is.
And two ninety one obviously
just seventy two million.
All right thank you madam chair
Madam speaker I appreciate that.
I am.
Okay it was a comfort to me to
know that the LFC was tracking
the bills that were coming to
the house floor going to the
Senate floor going without going
through the appropriation
process and they have accounted
for that within the this budget
is that accurate general.
Thank you us madam speaker
gentleman's they have been
tracking all those bills that
will have a negative impact on
the general fund they have
provided those to us they
provided those bills also the
Senate finance.
Fortunately a number of these
bills did not come to HSC we did
request but some of them did not
come here I don't know if they
did go to Senate finance but we
are tracking that we're looking
at that fiscal impact.
Okay so an effort was made to do
that to the best of our ability
to I know there's probably some
that are still out there that
have not been accounted for but
like I say it was a comfort to
me to know that that process was
taking place behind the scenes I
was not aware that until this
year and and so I think you I
think LFC for doing that and and
I appreciate you requesting that
all those bills come to your
committee I I appreciate that
very much.
madam speaker madam chair the
second thing I want to talk
about is the American rescue
plan.
And the of the that's the bidens
stimulus is and in the.
Back of our our
House Bill to.
And started about page two
twelve ourselves where I began
to provide those amounts in the
language there and and that's
where I picked up the American
rescue plan act of twenty twenty
one was in that language.
So madam speaker and madam chair
I'm curious about the the
process of what I'm finding in
the back of the book
As the Senate.
Appropriately did in my mind is
kind of
Took that issue.
Face it head on and began to
place those funds in in areas
that would be the greatest
benefit to the state in their
opinion I was curious do you
know if if the Senate worked
with the governor.
To come up with this allocation
that we see or do they do that
on their own that they do it
through LFC to the house have a
role in that process for we
identified to projects and
appropriated those dollars.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
man I can tell you when it came
to the house not a lot of a
connection there but I know
there was through LFC in the
governor's office particularly
when you're looking at the U. Y.
K. and that's where we had most
of our in but is with the
program there but when it came
to the actual break down
allocation I think that was a
Senate finance LFC Senate
finance staff activity.
Thank you madam chairman and
speaker
And I notice of the one point
six billion.
That is in this
package.
That of about one point two two
billion or one point.
Two two billion yes is a
accounted for but there's about
four hundred million that is not
accounted for madam chairman
speaker where is that money
Parker or what what is
anticipated for that four
hundred million that we don't
see a ton of fun.
I thank you madam speaker
gentleman that would just sit in
the general fund because we're
putting the entire one point six
billion and to the
appropriations account so
everything would state within
the general fund.
Thank you madam speaker madam
chair
A couple more questions the the
American rescue plan as I've
heard of promoted on the news
and things.
Not all that comes in twenty
twenty one the the bill signed
in twenty one the checks are
mailed out to some people but
madam chair I'm speakers my
understanding that a lot of that
money is not going to come for
three or four five years that
some of that is as far out as
twenty twenty six twenty twenty
seven do you know.
What Rader or do you know any
more information or does your
expert no when will these monies
actually arrive in the state of
New Mexico.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen your understanding
of those that yours is not how
we understand now.
We understand these funds would
what happened much much sooner
because it's all about recovery
tied to the COVID COVID problems
I believe it goes up to twenty
twenty three that has to be ex.
Twenty forward it has to be
completely expended.
Okay thank you madam chair that
this good knowledge good good to
know I appreciate that very much
I guess my final question madam
Speaker madam chair would have
to do with the
The stimulus funding that is
going to go directly into the
agencies and I know you spoke
about that a little bit
but I'm curious do we have a no
idea of what the total amount is
coming in to all of the agencies
I've heard three point something
billion and and and I have no
idea us but I'm hoping perhaps
you or your analyst with no
Madam speaker madam chair.
madam speaker gentle man the
number that I have in front of
me is about three point six
billion.
Okay so the agencies themselves
will get about three point six
billion directly in addition to
the one point six billion that
is kind of just coming in as a
statewide package which is what
we just talked about is that
occur
madam speaker gentleman's yes in
a big chunk of that it when I
was talking earlier about what
would go into public schools
it's over a billion dollars I
mean so third of that is it's
going into public schools.
these other these other agencies
that will be receiving at it's
going to be direct so those
agencies will then be preparing
they're spending plans that we
get a chance to look at
throughout the interim.
Okay thank you that's that's
very helpful generally and and.
But because the the one point
six billion that's on the plan
we have an opportunity to
perhaps
appropriate that are direct some
of those funds the Senate
finance committee did that with
the money going directly to the
agencies and not flowing through
the same process will we have an
opportunity other than in the
interim to kind of oversee those
funds or will they direct the
funds will the governor direct
those because they're going
directly to the state agencies.
Speaker gentle man there the
governor will be able to direct
that because they're within her
state agencies but certainly
we'll be looking at compliance
spending plans personality
issues all the general things
that will look at and I know
that aliens state what we want
to do the same thing with the
education funding that's coming
in they'll be looking at how
policies are being implemented
in and and what have you but
certainly will have some
oversight when you look at these
other funds are federal funds
are in a high level
Jeffrey she will be able to
drill down on now.
Okay thank you madam chairman
speaker I know so that was my
last question but it every time
you answer it triggers something
so if if the governor chooses
since this is a budget if the
governor chooses to line item
veto this I know when I left the
house we still had two hundred
million
in a language that she could
pull to put into the
unemployment insurance fund
Just in your words.
Where are aware of what's plan
B. if all of this is a line item
veto of the budget.
Thank you madam speaker
gentlemen if this is all line
item vetoed then in junior I
believe we put over a hundred
million and not general fund on
reoccurring and then two hundred
million then comes also out of
the framework within the
appropriations act should we're
not be allowed to.
Your is that six of six hundred
million that we have budgeted
for.
Madam chair of the thank you for
your patience I thank you for
your answers I find myself in
complete agreement with my
colleague from Rio Rancho.
I I think you have done a
yeoman's job of shepherding this
process.
And even though I am
uncomfortable with a five point
four percent year over year
increase I do plan to bottle on
with you and my colleague
to quicker thank you madam
speaker madam chair.
The gentle lady from grant
Hidalgo and Sierra counties
Representative Dow.
Thank you madam speaker does the
gentle lady yield.
I'd be happy to yield madam
speaker.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady I am looking at some
of the changes in the bill some
of the key changes and in the.
The section on higher education
spending the four point one
million in higher education
spending I am wondering if we
made it across the finish line
on addressing the desperate need
we have to provide adults with
alternative diplomas the high
school diploma and the way I'm
reading the amendment I don't
see that that issue was resolved
between higher ed and PED could
you explain to me and help me
understand what we're we are out
on the with this amendment on
adult diploma.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady the staff is looking
that up for mining my
recollection reckless excuse me
Representative collation.
What I'm sorry I'm tired of I
would like to just say that at
this point
it has not been reconciled yet
we need to look at it I need to
be able to give you a clear
answer madam speaker gentle lady
I don't I want to make sure that
we all understand stand it so we
could with what the staff looked
this up and I'd I'd be happy to
come back there we go.
Okay there they've got it thank
you madam speaker thank you the
gentle lady
We're looking at.
HSD code nine fifty the higher
education department under
general fund there's two hundred
fifty thousand dollars added for
the administration of the
external diploma program with
public schools.
My understanding is that that is
in the reoccurring appropriation
summary from the Senate finance
committee changes and there
that's exactly what we're going
to put into it because we're not
requesting out of HM state that
any changes happen we're asking
for concurrence in this would be
one of those items we're asking
for concurrence on.
Thank you Mr speaker Madam
speaker and thank you gentle
lady and so I I think that that
leaves us with a little bit of
work to do in two thousand
nineteen this body decided to
end adult education in PED once
someone turns twenty one and
that left a critical gap and and
I do think if correct me if I'm
wrong we're on six million for
the adult GED program that's run
through higher at is that
correct Madam speaker gentle
lady.
Thank you madam speaker yes from
what I'm looking at you are
correct thank you thank you
madam speaker thank you gentle
lady and what that those are
existing programs in our
colleges and I you know it's a
great program I have three
counties in my district and it's
a great program for Grant County
if you can access college like a
traditional students so these
GED programs that are run
through the universities are on
a rotation with the fall spring
and summer session so so it's a
you know basic GED high school
or high school diploma is a
barrier to to employment for
many people and when we ended
that high school diploma option
three PED it's at limits people
to a GED program through a
higher education institution and
for many people that's difficult
I know it I I everybody knows I
was it I was a teen mom and it
took me twenty four years to
finish my mic the bachelor's
degree that I started when I
found out I was pregnant and I
will tell you it is not a good
idea to take a seventeen year
gap in taking your second level
economics and statistics classes
those math classes were very
very difficult and that's what
many of our adults in New Mexico
face when they only have the GED
alternative it's very difficult
to go back into to be college
proficient in math and science
and I do I do know that this is
something that people are paying
attention to but the the numbers
as they are two hundred fifty
thousand dollars for the
external administration of a
program I don't know what that
can be directly used for the
program administration of the
program implementation of
services miss madam speaker
gentle lady is not to administer
program what is it will they be
able to actually provide
services direct services.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady and it would be to help
provide services thank you for
thank you madam speaker thank
you jelly so if that if we.
You know I've heard LFC suggests
that that we should be able to
do these diploma programs for
five hundred dollars for adult
learners so that that sounds
like it would be about five
hundred folks in New Mexico
could get a high school diploma
and be on the path towards
gaining and retaining employment
so it's it's a step in the right
direction but I do think it's
something that this body needs
to continue to work on and I
know it's something that the
Education Committee is paying
attention to and really really
wants to see addressed I know
everybody does especially as as
jobs and businesses have closed
their doors for ever and people
are looking for new types of
jobs they are we really need to
get rid of these barriers and a
diploma as a barrier and GT is
extremely difficult for for many
adults to two passed thank you
on that Madam speaker and gentle
lady I also and seeing in the
department Reese
the state departments are
receiving additional additional
money reoccurring funding over
what the house passed another
line item that I'm curious about
is the seven hundred thousand
dollars for the below the line
in the public education
department.
Madam speaker Julie could you
explain what that additional
seven hundred thousand dollars
for.
All right thank you madam
speaker that would be the food
and nutrition program.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady and what are we
doing act that food and
nutrition ministration program
when we doing.
Thank you Madam speaker and
gentle lady it was a request
that came through from the
executive what they needed to
have more funding and that and
and the Senate finance committee
agreed it says for food and
nutrition was an executive
request and what what it
basically does is it brings it
back to the FY twenty one level.
Thank you thank you madam
speaker thank you gentle lady
and I just want to I see
director Avid in the background
there thank you director Avid
for all your hard work this
session this is a bill I think
is going to see a lot of
bipartisan support and so we
just want to commend you on your
work and all of your staff as
well so in that I do I do want
the body to know that there's
been an effort to create some of
parity between this the benefits
of food security that are
offered to low income at risk
families school districts and
the very same program that is
mirrored for zero to five year
olds and that's called the child
and all who care program and
unfortunately the efforts to get
to to eliminate the co pays for
low income families whose
children are in childcare and
and pre K. on the non PED side
has failed repeatedly and so I
was hoping Madam speaker and
gentle lady that that we would
have done that this year but
again this year we have not
created parity for low income
families when their children are
below five in the child adult
food care program has seen
eligibility is USDA pretty much
the same copays but we're still
charging those co pays to low
income families with children
zero to five and so you know I I
I appreciate everybody's focus
on advocacy of early childhood
and I really like it when it's
reflected in the budget Madam
speaker and gentle lady on
additionally there is twelve
there's twenty one point five
million dollars for higher
education financial aid and with
these additions what is the
total that we are spending
between the governor's
opportunity scholarship program
and the lottery tuition Fund in
anything what's our total that
we're spending on scholarships.
I thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady what you're seeing
there in terms of the
opportunity scholarship and the
lottery is the ball but that
doesn't include other financial
aid or or scholarships that are
available we did put some
funding into some other
categories that the bulk of it
would be into the as you
mentioned I'm speaker twenty one
million into this.
Thank thank you madam speaker
and thank you gentle lady and
are we prioritizing any high
demand jobs or any you know
critical gaps to fill any
critical gaps in our in our high
demand jobs in the state with
these funding.
madam speaker gentle lady what
what we're doing with this as
well you might might know and
I'll just explain that we do
have seven million dollars
currently in the base or these
are scholarship programs so this
is in addition generally
they are reviewed in the
regulation and the programming
and
the rules are created by the pet
Department excuse me higher it
Department
I haven't seen the final in
terms of what's in the
opportunity scholarship and how
those are distributed certainly
with the lottery scholarship it
is needs based and
It's just it's based on it
there's not a there's not a
focus necessarily on high need
jobs in other words if we're
thinking of nursing students or
something like that I think it's
more equitably shared across the
board thank you thank you madam
speaker thank you gentle lady
and I and and in regards to the
lottery scholarship what is the
eligibility did we lowered to
two point oh through the budget
language or is it still two
point five for eligibility.
madam speaker gentle lady we
haven't changed any of that we
we we we look to the policy
guidance from the actual
department there's changes thank
you madam speaker thank you
gentle lady because we talk a
lot about this is a budget and
policy issues are decided and
you know those are policy and
practices in another committee
but yet you know we measure our
outcomes and it seems that we're
talking about scholarships are
outcome is how many people are
enrolled or perhaps even
graduation rates of the it would
be great you know if we were
able to pair these with at
placing people in high demand
jobs where we could say that
these investments where can be
measured indirectly result in
less gaps in nursing was a great
example I think teachers in
rural areas as an example
behavioral health providers of
therapist you know some of these
high demand jobs would be great
to see that you know I have not
a lot of doors in the last
session the last election and
you know you knock on the door
of the hard working plumber and
his hands are warning calloused
and he says why am I paying for
someone to get a degree in
basket weaving you know so I I I
think the more targeted we are
and the more intentionally can
be measuring outcomes is great
we definitely want to see folks
get high paying jobs that I
think COVID has shown that many
many of our essential jobs do
not even require high school
diploma I mean a college degree
at all and then and madam
speaker and gentle lady I see
that we are also getting seven
hundred fifty dollars per
household to the people who are
not eligible for federal
stimulus stimulus payment is
that it is that in addition to
the seven hundred and fifty that
we gave them in the special and
at this point what is the total
amount that we've given to
individuals who are not eligible
for federal stimulus payments.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady yes it's a in addition to
I'm trying to recall I think it
was six hundred dollars will
look that up during the
specialist for how that would be
distributed per person but these
are folks that what do the
cracks so to speak madam speaker
and gentle lady also this would
be the the seven hundred fifty
that you're talking about would
be for that same category.
Thank you madam speaker and
thank you gentle lady I think my
favorite part in this bill is
what the Senate did with the
projected one point six billion
dollars New Mexico will be
receiving in this next federal
stimulus package I think this is
probably the best example of us
exercising are equal and you and
independent exact legislative
branch of government and it
really makes you it's it's one
of those exciting things about
the bill and I'm really glad we
did it I see in here that
there's two point five million
directed to the department of
finance authority and I'm
particularly interested in the
fourteen point five million
that's going to go to the state
parks programs museums and
historical sites do you have a
breakdown of of what that might
look like or will DFA have full
discretion and how to distribute
those funds.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady I don't have a
breakdown that would all have to
come out of the parks and DFA as
they set up the budgets.
I don't have that break down at
this time I apologize thank you
thank you madam speaker and
thank you gentle lady because
you know we have tried for
multiple years when we had funds
in the budget to give dollars to
state parks for capital
improvements in infrastructure
improvements are state parks
they are rundown many of our
state parks have only Porta
potties and so but yet when we
try to direct those dollars to
state parks they say no they say
we can only handle around two
million dollars a year in
capital improvements they
haven't raised their to their
feet use usage fees in eighteen
years they've not use their
bonding capacity in eighteen
years.
Really hope these dollars go to
what I believe this body intends
which is improving our state
parks and I can those dollars be
spent on general operating
because they just say they want
more staff more law enforcement
to keep the doors closed to kick
people off campus no primitive
camping what what could they do
with these dollars Madam speaker
gentle lady thank you madam
speaker thank you gentle lady
is it it would be similar to the
way all budgets are developed
they're going to propose and
they would have the discretion
on how these things should be
here is that because you get
legislative intention is as you
mentioned improvements
Madam speaker gentle lady I
agree with you the parks in my
part of the world desperately
need sport desperately need
upgrades and certainly that's
the legislative intent thank you
madam speaker thank you gentle
lady in last year at last sixty
day session we managed to get
one point five million dollars
and improvements for elephant
Butte state park and by golly if
the state parks didn't revert it
they spend it on fire mitigation
which I think is also important
but we couldn't even get them to
spend the money on parks and for
that we put in the budget and
directed that way they reverted
the money and so that is because
the lady I think we all have
state parks that we love in our
communities and that we care for
I happen to have two of the most
visited lakes and my.
Also the speaker in order.
We're supposed to be on the
amendment that is what are
discussed in the supposed to be
about thank you madam chair
speaker.
Thank you madam speaker I
continue.
Yeah madam speaker I feel like
the amendment in asking these
questions is is appropriate so
go ahead please thank you thank
you madam speaker thank you
gentle lady and I really
appreciate you backing me up on
this because I hope that these
agency directors are listening
to the will of the legislators
who are bringing the will of our
constituents to this chamber and
voting accordingly and I I I
think it's really wise of us to
continue directing dollars to
our state parks and museums
especially in light of the
efforts to say that outdoor
recreation is our new economy
and so thank you Madam speaker
for that and gentle lady for
your support on that I would
just just point out that we have
this kind of once in a decade
opportunity when the state parks
director will soon be retiring
and I hope the folks listening
will encourage that the new hire
have some enterprise perspective
our other state parks some
resort experience and would want
to give some tender loving care
to our state parks that have
been far too long neglected
Madam speaker and gentle lady I
really appreciate the five
million dollars going to work
for solutions and just want to
commend secretary mccamley and
his team for the difficult task
they take thought taking on all
the hard work that they've done
I know they will put that to
good use six hundred million for
the unemployment trust fund so
needed we can not put the burden
of replenishing the unemployment
fund on the backs of New Mexico
small businesses and Madam
speaker delay I haven't had time
to go through all of this but
I'm just wondering was there
anything set aside for rate
increases to for third party
contractors I I believe we
passed sick leave pay last night
and we have a minimum wages
continue to grow anywhere in
this ammendment did we address
rate increases for third party
contractors who care for one
will populations thank you madam
speaker gentle lady not within
the Senate finance Amanda thank
you thank.
Madam speaker thank you gentle
lady and and then I I think this
is my last question I'm just
wondering on the in in the
public education department
appropriation on page one ninety
four I'm seeing that we're
getting this thirty million
dollars to the family income
index and and we talked a lot
about this in the.
Is this so we talked quite a bit
about it in the Education
Committee that we want to see a
pilot but I know Madam speaker
and gentle lady that that you
and Stapleton and some others of
us have signed onto memorial to
look at other indicators in the
then just poverty and some of
those were mobility and and
English second language and
minority status and so I we just
for the bodies information we
made it really clear Education
that we see this as a pilot and
that we are not saying this is
the only way that we want to
move forward but it could be a
way that we move forward looking
at are at risk index madam
speaker and gentle lady do you
have any thoughts on this family
index and this thirty million
dollar pilot over two years.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady it's it's true
when not we were all signed on
to a memorial to look at those
things that are inside the SCG
and particularly at risk so you
had mentioned some of those
components on madam speaker
gentle lady but truly we're
looking at this is a pilot I
felt that in I think the only at
LUFC Committee also felt that
this is something that we need
to take a close look at and
that's why you you'll see it in
in the budget thank you thank
you madam speaker thank you
gentle lady and I was happy to
support this bill when it went
to the Education Committee
knowing that there still work to
do and that there's there's
opportunity in index that's and
equity index that's out there
and there's also the Yazzie
Martinez lawsuit that we need to
be able to to resolve the courts
and I think that's a really good
robust look at the school
funding formula and are are
funding index would be one way
to address that with the lawsuit
right after that on page one
ninety four is something that
I've never seen before I've no
idea what this is it says a
pilot additional instructional
time and high poverty and low
performing elementary schools
and it says that the public
secretary public education will
be making grants to qualifying
elementary schools to provide
additional instructional hours
can you explain to me how this
is this twenty million dollars
is different than all the other
hundreds of millions that we put
into kindergarten K. five plus
extended learning community
schools twenty first century
except truck.
Thank you Madam speaker and
gentle lady this is something
that I believe it's been an
important issue with health
education in terms of making
sure that there is funding
available to act
additional hours in terms of the
schools I know that there's been
somewhat of a debate I've been
listening from the sidelines
madam speaker gentle lady among
the education committee's about
extension of days versus time
additional time during the day
and this is this is what helps
fund those additional the
additional time thank you madam
speaker and gentle lady I'm I'm
really confused because I
thought that's what K. five plus
an extended learning was I can't
can you have someone help me out
on the difference between them I
don't I don't understand this
appropriation.
Misappropriation madam speaker
ties to ours and K. five plus
Madam speaker gentle lady ties
today's.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady so I suppose this
would become important if we do
not pass the flexibility bill
that has seemed to a stalled in
the Senate.
And Senate bill forty that seems
to stall in our chamber so we're
going to be flexible on with
twenty million out of over two
hundred million appropriation.
Madam speaker gentle lady that
that's the point.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady wanted to
continue to pay attention to the
dollars that leave my district
and get reverted to the school
reform Fund and I would suggest
that those folks that are from
rural communities that have a
lot of Act producers do the same
thank you and and and and Madam
speaker and gentle lady I to I'm
really inclined to vote for this
bill I am really impressed with
the work the collaboration
between the house and the Senate
and particularly thankful for
the work that has been done to
address critical
Budget needs with the next round
of COVID funds really thank you
madam speaker thank you gentle
lady.
The gentleman from San Juan
Representative lane.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentle lady from McKinley and
San Juan kindly yield.
I'd be happy to yield.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady and I know there
was a reference earlier to that
dapper gentleman behind you
Director Abbey and I just want
to say before I came legislature
I honestly had New no idea who
David Abbey is and I think it's
important for the citizens of
New Mexico who are watching this
to understand just what a vital
role that then plays for our
state of the wealth of knowledge
he's been for us as members
and and how well he he interacts
with both sides are we putting
together budget so I just want
to thank him he's been a great
resource for us as a body and me
as an individual legislator and
with that madam speaker gentle
lady I know there was a
reference earlier to about you
know this
Two hundred thirty page bill so
the for the people that are
watching the webcast I think
this is this will be helpful for
some of the dialogue I have for
the for the gentle lady from
McKinley County and San Juan is
you can actually pull up but
this this whole budget that's
been amended by the Senate
online currently while we're
debating and the way you do that
as you go to the the
legislature's website you find
H. B. two.
On the left there's committee
reports amendments and you can
click on the F. SFC committee
report and the reason why I want
to highlight that is because you
can actually once you have a PDF
document you can actually do a
word search so if you wanted to
provide state of how is the
department transportation or
part of health if you want to
look at a particular agency and
see how they're being funded
instead of trying to read
through a two hundred twenty
page bill you can actually do a
word search and so I find that
to be very helpful when we're
having these discussions.
Now Madam speaker gentle lady
from McKinley and San Juan.
I do want to ask couple
questions on the key hearing
issues document that's where I'm
gonna refer to mostly.
And madam speaker gentle lady on
page two if you wouldn't mind
turning their.
There's under the paragraph.
American rescue plan slash
federal stimulus stimulus plan.
this is in reference to
president Biden's stimulus and
it's my understand is going to
be a one point six three billion
is what is supposed to be
allocated to the state of New
Mexico is that correct.
madam speaker gentleman that's
correct.
And madam speaker of the gentle
lady.
I I tried to search through our
current H. B. two in its current
vision to provide some of these
breakdowns and so if if if the
gentle lady from San Juan
McKinley County would would also
look at HB two and I want to
turn the body's attention to
page one hundred eighty eight.
Where there Madam speaker thank
you John.
Thank you Mr thank you Julie
from Madam Kinley so I noticed
that there's fifty million.
Of these federal stimulus
dollars going to the medical
assistance program can you just
highlight for the body what that
phone doesn't whites important
every year more specifically
fifty million of the funds.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen basically what
we're doing with this with this
pace which is of sixty seven
Human Services Department what
we're saying is that we would
like to have fifty million
dollars taken from these federal
funds to help backfill are
Medicaid expenses however if if
if the federal money is not
allowed to then it would have
Moffit would immediately come
from the general fund but what
we're trying to do here is to
make sure that this federal the
I mean the most important piece
in my opinion Madam speaker and
gentleman is a second line Wirth
says authorized in the American
rescue plan after twenty twenty
one into the appropriation
contingency fund what that means
Madam speaker John that is that
the federal funds would be put
into our appropriation
contingency fund would like
fifty million of it used for of
Medicaid if that's not allowed
then general fund would pick up
to fifty million.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
San Juan McKinley I appreciate
that and one of one of the
things I also learned as a
freshman HF Agency is when we
talk about budget we we tend to
think about that in terms of
dollars and cents and it it
certainly includes that
obviously but language actually
is extremely important and I
hope the body understands that
you can put all the dollars and
cents in there that that you
want but if you don't have the
appropriate language to direct
those dollars and cents then
just a few trial exercise so I
appreciate you you highlighting
language and I I do want to go
through a few of how these these
federal stimulus funds gonna be
spent what now with this a
minute because I I think it's
important to highlight what
these funds are and and why it's
important that we direct
specific dollar amounts to these
funds so madam speaker gentle
lady I would like to look at
also page two hundred thirteen.
All right where there.
And madam speaker gentle lady
the way I understand this
provision is is where marking
twenty million dollars sure the
early childhood education fund.
Is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes.
And madam speaker gentle lady
can you just explain the body
what the twenty million dollars
why it's going to this phone and
why this phone is important.
It is thank you madam speaker
Gen gentleman last year I
believe it was as we actually
set up the fund of what we want
to do is to make sure that it's
capitalized so the earnings from
the funding can be moved into
early childhood programs.
Mr gentility thank you for that
and and
you know I guess just a frame
the discussion I do support the
S. of the the Senate's finance
committee alterations so the
point my questions just to
highlight some of these big
changes so we know what we're
voting on and why it's important
to support these allocation so
we're on page two thirteen if we
flip just one page down the page
two hundred and fourteen I
noticed that we're also
earmarking from these federal
stimulus dollars five million
dollars to the key piece of
Bajor senior dignity Fund would
Madam speaker gentle lady would
you currently just tell us what
that frontier does and why it's
important relegating five
million dollars to it.
Thank you madam speaker
gentlemen
Thank you so very interesting
your dignity Fund is a
recognition of all of the hard
work at my former chairman did
is HSC chair regarding elderly
care are care for the elderly
and what we're trying to do here
is because we were not able to
capitalize it to the level we
wanted to the original fund was
set up we're trying to do that
here into providing more
dollars.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
McKinley and San Juan I
appreciate that response I also
appreciate the heart of making
sure that we take care of the
older folks in our community
it seems like we live in a
society that tends to celebrate
use and utility over was the man
and I believe our older people
have so much to bring to our
community so I appreciate this
year mark and then also just one
page down on to fifteen.
it did there's a series of
contingent appropriations and
and madam speaker gentle lady
from San Juan McKinley would you
just explain to the body what
what does this mean when we say
an additional contingent
appropriation.
Excuse me at that have a Mike on
thank you up Madam speaker
gentleman what we talked about
an additional contingent
appropriation all the receipt of
any federal funds into our
treasury.
What we do is that we make sure
that they go into categories
that we've identified.
So what we're looking at
the perfect as an example I'm
looking at I did see for the
provision of government services
to the extent of the reduction
in revenue due to the Corona
virus for back feeling basically
trying to make sure that we do
have those we're looking at
things like madam speaker
gentleman investments in water
sewer and broadband
infrastructure
We just went through here you'll
see this speaker gentlemen how
each one of these things were
broken down in in trying to
assist the membership madam
speaker gentleman we get find
the high level sheet you can see
exactly the breakdown but I do
agree with the gentleman from
San Juan the light which is
incredibly important you can see
where where it's going exactly
go why.
Mr speaker as the firm's McKenna
someone appreciate that and and
I do think it's important so we
did flip the page to sixteen for
those who track an actual budget
and there are six of breakdowns
here on page two sixteen page
two seventeen.
Point five million or going to
the park former finance minister
should be FAA and these are for
you know what we call the so I
would call COVID impact release
to our taxpayers for New Mexico
number two does the same thing
on page two sixteen at the rate
of twenty point five million.
And then
I am excited to see the ten
million in the tourism
department there on page
Two seventeen Mr speaker gentle
and I do think that's an
industry that we need to
continue to prop up and
encourage because New Mexico has
so much to offer in terms of
tourism in terms of destination
culture beauty the people
themselves so I appreciate that
a specific question I have is
paragraph six there on page two
hundred seventeen as I
understand that paragraph it's
taking six hundred million from
the federal stimulus dollars and
using it to back fill what's
what is the deficit in our
unemployment insurance fund and
so madam speaker J. gentlelady I
think my first question with
this is would you mind just
updating the body what is our
current deficit in the
unemployment insurance program.
Thank you
Madam speaker gentle.
I thought that the current
deficit was closer to seven
hundred but I'm gonna double
check that with the staff the.
All right thank you madam
speaker gentle man by the end of
the fiscal year and be close to
two hundred million currently
it's five hundred million.
The other way around.
Madam speaker gentle lady I'm
sorry would you mind just
restating that I've added quite
track what that was.
All right thank you madam
speaker gentlemen it is two
hundred million now and five
hundred million at the end of
the fiscal year
calendar year.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
McKinley San Juan does that
include this six hundred million
appropriation here from the
federal dollars.
Thank you madam speaker
gentleman no it does not.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
McKinley St one so it seems to
me that this will take us a long
ways towards making up for that
deficit and and the problem is
for our New Mexico businesses if
if we don't take care of this
deficit that deficit will be
taking care of the Feds make
that very clear and so are often
as a state I think is an
important one which is let's do
the best that we can to cover
that deficit so that way are
employers unemployment insurance
rates don't go up in order to
cover this so I appreciate
seeing yes additional dollars
going into this fund and I would
encourage the body to support
that as well.
And then
Madam speaker gentle lady from
San Juan of referencing now the
key hearing issues document
again.
we were on page two if we could
flip the next page to page
three.
Speaker John that we're here.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady from McKinley San Juan
I noticed that our revenue
production production for FY
twenty two is seven point four
eight three billion
when where those revenue
production predictions last
updated.
Thank you madam speaker John
whether updated in February for
a consensus revenue report.
And madam speaker gentle lady at
I know this is probably a bit of
speculation but with the news
that the binding hold on new
leasing permits for oil and gas
is set to expire I think on
Sunday if I remember correctly
March twenty one it it seems to
me that if that expires and
we're allowed to begin renewing
and issuing permits for federal
lands for for drilling and other
activities it seems to me that
these revenue project
predictions could potentially
even increase over what's the
numbers here are so I'm I am the
first to hear that that is going
to be lifted I do have a
question the bottom of this page
so we have the ending balance.
Estimated to be one point seven
seven four billion and a
percentage of that is expressed
is twenty three point eight
percent.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
McKinley San Juan would you mind
sharing with the body what
what's the benchmark percentage
because we're we're saying it's
twenty three point eight but if
you don't know what the
benchmark is that's kind of a
number of acting can you fill in
some details for us there.
All righty thank you madam
speaker gentle but you know what
we set our LFC guidelines for
budgeting we do that madam
speaker gentleman in August when
we get our first consensus
revenue report and generally
it's anywhere between twenty and
twenty five percent we like
higher level reserve numbers
because it makes a lot of
difference we have tight
Financial Times or the economy
is down so we add in I know that
the governor had a projected up
reserve level of twenty five
twenty five percent ours was
closer to twenty two twenty
three and so this fits right in
to where we think we need to be
in terms of the money in the
bank so to speak should we hear
down tough Financial Times.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
McKinley San Juan thank you I
think that helps give some
context to what what is this
percentage means a good
percentage isn't about
percentage it sounds like we're
right within the range where we
ought to be.
Madam speaker gentle lady I I'm
kind of curious about the
history though
minister gentlelady went when
did you first take office in
this body.
That's not in the amendment but
I'll tell you anyway hi I was
elected in two thousand one and
madam speaker gentle but I've
served on the Appropriations
Committee since that time I
became the chair and twenty
seventeen.
Minister gentlelady so I feel
like I'm in a corner and I can
assure the judgment connect
these up your honor I'm not look
I'm not going straight the
reason I ask that is because
again I think it helps provide
some context for this twenty
three point eight percent number
can you recall what's the lowest
you've seen this number during
your twenty plus years here just
just roughly.
In my time Mr serving on HSC
it's been one percent.
Madam speaker generally I think
that's really important for us
as a body to get that context
so so we we have again some
something objective to compare
this twenty three point eight
percent next to one percent
would be terrifying to me I'm
I'm thankful that we're not
there in this day and age.
Right now Madam speaker gentle
lady continuing in this document
if we could go to pages over.
It's the general fund
appropriation summary by agency
is what it says at the top.
Before there.
Thank you madam speaker General
lady I want to focus on the
second column to the right those
are the S. SFC Amendment so that
the body knows these are a lot
of the equipment that we're
gonna be talking about and and
the ones that are pertinent to
this ammendment.
The first one I see is line item
twenty six.
it's twenty five point nine.
The let's see we're talking in
thousands where is this in the
budget I couldn't find a
specific line item for this
number for the New Mexico
compiling sting Commission.
The compilation the current
commission
is.
They're looking for that now
madam speaker gentleman's that
each to.
It's on page two of the bill.
Madam speaker generally to
participate just to.
Madam speaker gentlemen if you
look on page one right after the
council service it starts there
with the New Mexico compilation
commission some the Senate
version but it goes into page
two.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady from McKinley San Juan I
don't so it doesn't look like
there's a specific delineation
for this twenty five point nine
of so where would the twenty
five point ninety fitting into
of the numbers we have here on
page two.
If I could madam speaker
gentlemen if you look at page
two on the Senate version and
you see they General Fund
column.
Any state appropriations.
Five hundred twenty nine.
It's in that.
Thank you Mr generated from a
can the county and San Juan
system going towards general
operations and it and for those
who are familiar it's it's not a
very big agency the Mexican
politician Commission but it
actually does a good service for
the state of New Mexico because
one of the things that it does
and what they've updated
recently as you can search all
of our statutes online even
annotated and so you can see the
revisions throughout the years
that's free to the public you
can also search New Mexico
Supreme Court opinions New
Mexico court of appeals opinions
so we talk about you know these
these catchy phrases like access
to justice in in knowing what
our our lawmakers are doing this
goes a long ways towards
advancing those so I like to see
some additional dollars going
even though it's a very small
agency the next item is line
thirty.
And that's three hundred fifty
thousand to the ministry of
office the courts.
And I found that on page one
hundred ninety two of the budget
I believe is for that is that is
that correct.
Madam speaker gentle man looks
like it's on page four.
Then speaker gentle lady okay so
I was but I wasn't looking at a
different preparation for the
sages agency.
At three hundred fifty thousand
dollars on page one ninety two
so what were these three hundred
fifty thousand dollars going
towards.
Well I just just for update for
Madam speaker and for the
members these are reoccurring
that you'll see here on this
page that we're talking about
the high level summary by agents
State sometimes you'll see a
different expenditures in the
back of the bill and those are
one time so this one is so on
page four.
And it is
General fund.
It is right well we've got
things like pre trial services
general fund one point two
million.
And that was increased and then
you can see the rest from there
on page five.
Mr gently from McKinley County
San Juan so that five hundred
thousand isn't donated
separately it's it's involved in
in maybe one or more of these
cell phones is that right thank
that is correct gentleman and
what we do madam speaker gentle
management track it by their
fund code.
Mr gently from San Juan McKinley
thank you for that so I I do
have questions on a few of these
so my.
I know it's might be off because
it sounds like I was look I was
doing a word search for the
agency and then I would find a
donor match but it may just be
coincidence of the dollar match
early matches something else
that's a nonrecurring
expenditures so but I do want to
ask them these questions anyways
and I will say that when we look
at of all of these district
courts and all these District
Court attorneys receiving
additional expenditures I I
think that's an important note
for us to make as a body because
this is where the the sausages
made so to speak in terms of
real justice on the streets is
in our court system the third
branch of government there often
one of the lowest funded
branches and not because they're
important but just because
there's other state agencies
that take up a big part of the
budget so to the extent that we
can continue to to fund them
increase that I think it's good
for the people of New Mexico no
I didn't catch the last item
there of on within this sub
category line item sixty one the
New Mexico public defender
Department there's a five
hundred thousand dollar
reference there and did I hear
previously that was for a
contract public defender worked
in rural areas.
And madam speaker that is
correct and just to get on madam
speaker gentleman what we're
looking at this Senate finance
committee amendments these are
added to what we had put in an
HFC.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
McKinley someone thank you for
that and for anybody in the body
that's wanting will refer to
spend half a million extra why
don't we just hire some
employees why are we doing
contract employees and let me
tell you why that's important
that we do it this way in our
rural areas specifically when it
comes to public defenders we we
have a difficult time of filling
vacancies attracting lawyers to
come service public defenders in
these rural areas so then the
issue because well how do we
find good legal defense in our
rural areas for are defendants
are constitutionally entitled to
legal counsel and so one of the
ways that you can address that
without having to worry about
filling a vacancy is through the
use of these contract employees
and so what you do is you have
local lawyers who are already in
that legal market they can bid
for these of public contract
agreements and then they are
given these public contractor a
public defender contractor
assignments and so they they as
a result because the early in
the community they feel big gap
that's needed within our
judicial system so I appreciate
seeing that the next item is one
seventy nine still on this page
and I noticed that there is a
million dollar.
increases department of
information technology no I
found a reference to a million
dollars on page thirty seven I
don't know if that's the correct
reference or not.
Madam speaker gentlemen page
thirty seven has a portion of
that out where the department of
information technology but we
can look for the rest of it.
Mr.
Excuse.
Excuse me Madam speaker jelent
you on that budget bill page
thirty seven as you mentioned
good trucker that's going and to
contract services under the
general fund piece.
Thank you madam speaker of
gentle lady from McKinley San
Juan so anchors you hear that at
least a portion of that is going
to go towards cyber security I
remember hearing our
presentation and HSC from this
agency and express this is one
of their biggest concerns for us
as a state is cyber security
and you know not to be doing
well but I think that is
probably the wave of the future
in terms of of stealing data
stealing identities and also
form of you know essentially
warfare and so the to the extent
that we can really secure IT
systems that hold sensitive data
across agencies I think that's
very important.
The last one on this page Madam
speaker gentle lady from
McKinley San Juan is line eighty
two.
There's a reference to five
hundred thousand dollars going
to secretary of state
I found the secretary of state
reference on page forty but I
couldn't find a reference a
specific line item to this I
heard thousand can you help me
understand where these dollars
are going.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman it would be in the
other category for the elections
program.
Mr Kirk uh gently from a ten
cent once and we say elections
program for the benefit of the
body is that to to prepare and
funding for the holding in
overseeing elections.
Madam speaker gentle lady yes.
Mr generated from Janice I want
to and I would ask that we now
flip the page.
And I will I want to look at
line one oh six.
And there's a reference there's
spaceport authority in their
receiving two hundred fifty
thousand dollars.
And this along with the next few
references like I couldn't find
in the budget where this two
hundred fifty thousand have
several items so I'm just trying
to get some insight in terms of
where does this to fifty
thousand fit into the money
going to states for forty.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman this is on page fifty
nine and it is under general
fund if you look at contractual
services.
Mr a generally thank you I see
that.
And again I think this is a
another important industry that
we as a state need to take note
of I think it's a burgeoning
industry so I'm I'm happy to see
some dollars additional dollars
going there that was added in
from Senate side.
and then just a few more
questions about specific line
items so if we look at on this.
general fund appropriation
summer break agencies document
page us using line one thirty
six.
There's one point two five
million added that is going to
the department of environment
and again I within H. B. two I
couldn't find a specific line
item reference to this so madam
speaker gentle lady from San
Juan McKinley would you kindly
let me know how these dollars
bring earmarked.
Thank you madam speaker a
gentleman if you look on page
one of four and one oh five.
It was when I met with the
Senate finance chair there was a
need to add additional dollars
into the state OSHA program.
And then speaker gentle lady
from McKinley San Juan I'm
trying to remember my afternoons
but is that the occupational
hazard and I forget what all
stands for is that the is that
the one yes Mr speaker gentleman
you're correct.
So we're we're basically talking
about workplace injuries is what
I remember ocean in trying to
specifically trying to prevent
those from occurring and then
just a few lines down the line
one thirty nine children youth
and families department there's
an allocation of seven hundred
thousand that was added on the
Senate side and and this is
another one I couldn't find a
specific line item reference to.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
McKinley San Juan would you help
me understand how the seven
thousand dollars being
allocated.
Thank you madam speaker if you
look on page one of seven.
Already my understanding is that
six hundred is four eight six
hundred thousand of that is for
testing program and a hundred
thousand of that is for.
For youth mentorship.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
McKinley St one thanks for the.
The explanation for that I.
I like the idea of youth
mentorship some glad to hear
this and dollars going there and
then I I just have two more
questions on this specific page
if we look down at line one
fifty eight.
There's six hundred ninety two
thousand appropriated
additionally the public
education department
specifically.
Special appropriations so again
Madam speaker gentle lady from
McKinley San Juan not not having
found a specific line item
reference to what this how the
six ninety two is being
allocated can you help me fill
in that gap.
If you look on page Madam
speaker gentle not on page one
twenty five that's the food and
nutrition program that was asked
about earlier.
Mr generally thank you for that
I.
We should I'm I when I was
making notes almost missed that
question so I apologize for
being duplicate of the last
question on this page is is
really I guess sort of a general
one so if we look at line one
sixty four I know I know that
there's two point two five
million additional going to hire
a department.
And.
Each line item below this of on
this page in the next several
below you're more specific
dollars to specific universities
which I don't take issue with
but I'm just curious what is the
two point two five million
reference in one sixty four and
how is that different than
sending money directly to these
higher departments.
Thank you madam speaker
gentleman's two million of that
underline one eighty force for
the opportunity scholarship.
Mexico and the adult Education
proposal that we've talked about
in an earlier discussion with
one of the other members.
then speaker a gently from
McKinley St one thank you and
just so the the body in the
public understands that
opportunity scholarship for
higher and that is a different
scholarship program than what I
think at least I grew up
thinking of in terms of the
Mexico scholarships which is a
lottery program it's a different
type of program and if people
are interested in and interest
for the kids I encourage you to
to look for that.
and then if we flip to the next
page.
line one hundred eighty nine.
I noticed there is thirty four
million added on to the Senate
side to to help with the
solvency of the E. R. B. fund.
and so madam speaker gentle lady
from San Juan of the way I
understand is what we are.
What we have been working on is
a one percent increase on the
employer portion of the E. R. B.
fund is that correct.
that is speaker gentleman that
is correct.
And madam speaker gentle lady
from McKinley San Juan
so this thirty four million is
this it is this bear market as
the language such that the money
will go directly to school
districts to help cover that one
percent increase or or what is
happening with these thirty four
million dollars.
I thank you madam speaker
gentleman this goes into the
pension fund
and you might recall and speaker
gentlemen the actual bill that
we don't lands we actually
changed to that so we're going
to be making some changes next
January to accommodate the bill
that we dealt with in HSC Madam
speaker I gently from McKinley
St want to do I do appreciate
you bringing that to the test of
the body and and so that we do
understand this money will go
directly to fund.
and I remember reading from our
L. C. volumes that that there is
some concern about the solvency
of this fund and you know I
think one of the ways that we
can assure our teachers across
our state that we do care about
them that their work is
important is to work towards
making this fund solvent and I I
think this is one way to go
about doing that
I do have concerns about.
Of the Burnell placed on
individual school districts but
that's outside the purview of
this ammendment.
and then.
her.
Mr chairman make sure that you
know just make sure I didn't
miss anything.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
McKinley San Juan I I appreciate
the your patience I I leveled a
lot of very specific budgetary
questions that you as always I
am very impressed with your
ability to handle the budget as
a whole the entire process and
when we get into the the nitty
gritty is naturally bring would
say you you handle the nitty
gritty very well and so I
appreciate the dialogue and help
fill in a lot of gaps for me and
hopefully for members and those
watching at home or or the
office so with that I yield back
then speaker.
The gentleman from Colfax curry
Harding quay Roosevelt San
Miguel and beautiful you
Representative showers thank you
madam speaker does gentlelady
yields.
Be happy to yield madam speaker.
Speaker gentle lady I remember
when we started this process we
had very much lower revenue
estimates and many of the
agencies were.
asked to cut at least five
percent save five percent off
their budgets and thank goodness
the revenue estimates have gone
up over time and we will that
were able to keep some of those
folks flatter or give him at
least what they needed to
survive and do the job that they
were sent that they're supposed
to do.
The lady do you have any idea
how much is the revenue
estimates gone up since that
state in the special session.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen and and waste all
that of course in a chair state
law special session we were
worried back in June that we
would be heading up to a billion
dollars when we got we came in
in January.
So madam speaker gentle lady
there.
That being said there are
several things that I was very
proud we were able to do hello
we funded transportation was one
of the largest budgets I've ever
had I think one of the
challenges that transportation
faces right now is contractors
they're coming out of a time
when they had a much smaller
budget a lot of those
contractors around the state of
got out of business but I can
see this year I think they're
geared up to use a lot of the
funding that they that they have
received so I'm a very.
Expected that we're going to see
some see a lot of a lot of work
get done on a range this year.
One of the things that we were
able to this budget was replaced
the twenty million dollars of
been taken now the rainy day
fund I am I am very proud of
that
thanks a long was funding of
several agencies that that we're
going to be hard if we had the
if we have got a five percent a
couple of things that I wish we
could do a little better as some
of the broadband fan funding I
think it just went off in
several different directions in
I think it's very important I
hope that we and I think there's
some things coming down the pike
is that it may have just passed
and that would organize this
broadband effort a little better
than what it is we we put the
funding there and I hope that we
can prioritize it in doing so
it's better that it will get
broadband out to the rural areas
and to the.
This is in the state that don't
have it.
Another issue is a lot of the
cares Act funding that we
received were aimed at title one
schools a lot of our small rural
schools were affected by
hundreds of thousands or even
millions of dollars and they may
or may not well maybe I may not
be eligible for the title one
funding and so I hope that
there's a way that we can help
them with the challenges they
face due to their rural area and
also the COVID
manager's been honored to work
with you in the staff on this
budget I'm very proud of our
product this year from what the
Senate's it back I I really
Appreciate them appropriating
the the new funding the by the.
Funding.
and I just was a little curious
they is they put it out to
various agencies well those
agencies now could come back
with a proposed budget of how
they're going to use that money
for.
That they were given.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentleman yes still have to
be able to come back and put
together a sources and uses for
us to look at during the interim
we're going to want to look at
that and see where where dollars
are are going.
Thank you Mr
chair and and then.
Speaker.
Our.
As a said it was an honor to
work with you on this project in
our the body to vote for a I
think it's the best we've had
since I've been here.
Representative Chatfield I
apologize for renaming you.
At the gentleman from Chavis Lee
Ann Roosevelt at leader
Anderson.
Representative Anderson are you
available.
We'll go on to the gentleman
from Bernalillo county
Representative Rehm.
Madam speaker will the gentle
lady from San Juan yield.
Be happy to yield madam speaker.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
from San Juan I miss the dollar
amount that we're going to
supplement the lottery
scholarship fund with can you
tell me that again please.
Thank you madam speaker
gentlemen it is ten million
dollars I can't ten million
dollars.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
from San Juan
I find this troubling and here's
why I find it troubling when I
first came to the legislature I
think the lottery scholarship is
a well needed very beneficial
plan for our children we need an
educated society we need our
kids educated and we need them
to stay here.
But during the recession years
and madam speaker gentle lady as
you may remember the
universities were coming to us
because we had a plus balance in
that fund at that time.
And they continued to raise
their tuitions their fees by
about three to five percent per
year.
This legislature warned them
that if they continue that and
particularly in the recession
years one everyone was cutting
back.
That they would eventually
capture all the money in the
fund and there would be no more
growths.
And I find that really troubling
of that the universities didn't
heed that warning and that they
felt.
That they could go ahead and
increase their spending over
those recession years not
cutting back like all other
businesses and everyone else had
to.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
from San Juan do you know the
dollar amount the University of
New Mexico just gave a golden
parachute to the basketball
coach.
madam speaker gentlemen I'm
afraid I don't but I'm hoping
that you did because you know
that's been something that's
both both of us.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
from San Juan it's four hundred
and fifty thousand dollars plus
an additional hundred thousand
dollars that U. N. M. is going
to pay New Mexico State
University to buy out that
contract.
Why we can't write a contract
with these coaches that have
performance standards and end
these golden parachutes I don't
understand.
When the universities come to us
and say we need more money and
then they blow a half million
dollars of money in that manner
I find it just totally up
setting that they would come to
this of legislature and raise
the fees on the kids who are
trying to become educated.
Madam speaker Madam speaker and
gentle lady for San Juan thank
you for that information and I
hope that the universities are
listening thank you.
The representative from Chavez
levy and Roosevelt
Representative Anderson are you
available now.
Yes I am and chairman of and
madam chairman I'm.
Gonna try to be fairly short
this morning because of.
The couple of the topics that
are most interested in have been
covered yield Madam speaker
thank you because madam chair
and that was my next question
and I think you and your staff
for the work you've done this
session on a of.
Another monumental budget
challenge.
Speaker.
Chairman I I come to this
concurrence debate with.
Some emotions and feelings.
And growing skepticism about
this budget.
What I think.
About.
It's today.
I think our spending is up five
point four percent.
I think.
We're going to get one and a
half percent salary increase to
employees should never missed a
paycheck this last year while
other New Mexicans have.
No paycheck business closures
and bankruptcy.
I'm distressed about higher
taxes high unemployment.
And finally madam chair.
We.
It was our schools will be open.
For the last year for over the
last year schools been closed
and I don't know why we're
finally next.
Going to reopen our schools.
This project your voice is that
as and and and that is perhaps
of.
Our greatest accomplishment.
Accomplishment I'm pretty
discouraged.
I see this budget is sort of a
kick the can down the road.
I see New Mexico becoming more
and more dependent on the
federal deficit spending.
I think this cannot be the path
to economic growth and future
prosperity.
So it is with great.
Visitation of that I.
Then I I certainly supported
many of the motions have built
this budget and and I need to on
that and but on that point if I
could I'm going to ask a quick
question one about lottery
scholarship of quite a
discussion about that I would
only remind us that only one
bill in this legislative session
attempted to put more revenue
into lottery scholarship it
never got out of its first
Canadian.
On that we have the state of New
Mexico general fund once again
seeing the lottery scholarship
up to get it over the hump that
is not a long range plan and we
must continue to look for new
revenue sources to shore up the
lottery scholarship madam
chairman concurrence this
budget.
One money simply cannot keep.
The deficiency in lottery
scholarship revenue.
So now we look at.
The Senate had added five
hundred thousand dollars in new
ownership program.
And I thought to myself Gee whiz
I don't think we heard about
that on the house side I wonder
what that's about madam chair
question.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentlemen this is part of the
executive recommendation when
they when they were working with
Senate finance on amendments I
see well.
Madam chairman I think it is a
very bad time to take New Mexico
businesses when they are on the
ropes economically.
And and regulatory burden
penalty and I supposed from
oceans factions I hope madam
chairman that is not the purpose
of this five hundred thousand
dollar ownership increased
question.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
man that is not my understanding
it's my understanding that up
the plan is to actually get the
program back to where it was
supposed to be a because there'd
been some recommended cuts I see
thank you madam chairman for
that response
I hope that we will not return
home here about a whole new bevy
of oceans factions on businesses
that have.
That are struggling to survive
and that we talked about that
many times this legislative
session on various bills and we
return home with the same
reality madam chairman I could
up Madam speaker talk about
retirement contribution madam
speaker this to budget have any
money in it for para.
Retirement of.
The paralyzed bility.
madam speaker gentleman no.
Thank you I remember the one
thousand a year to back that we
did have some General Fund para
fission see funding but the we
don't have that this year but we
do have thirty four million.
Added to E. R. B..
Of.
To the here are the pension is
that correct madam chair.
yes madam speaker gentleman yes.
And that.
Actuarial.
Ability is eight point three
billion dollars is is I read
that a Navajo see documented I
assume that's our best estimate
in this legislative session on
the unfunded pension liability
in the ERP you agree with that
Madam chairman question are
madam speaker I do agree with
that I read the same report.
Thank you madam chairman well.
I.
I'm I'm distressed that we
go home having not addressed
your B..
Unfunded pension liability in a
comprehensive way thirty one
million is yes less than one
half of one percent of the
funded liability and at the rate
of thirty four million dollars a
year that means that if we can
just do that for the next one
hundred fifty six years we might
just be able to close that up
pretty good on what he has been
referred to as an employment in
solvency.
So if you well okay we just keep
on thirty four million and and
and and and insolvency we can
just do that for a long long
time.
I think that these educators in
New Mexico were either looking
forward to their pensions or
getting their pensions are being
sold a bill of goods on the
insolvency of the fund and the
piecemeal approach that we take
in trying to resolve this
insolvency so I'm I'm really
object resist thirty four
million dollars the funding of
that I think is like in the
ocean with the new patient care.
So.
I think.
I think that's gonna.
Add me with very few questions
and more COVID because a lot of
it has been covered and the I
find it interesting that we talk
about lottery in the short
coming there and yet we've done
nothing we talk about the E. R.
the the the pension insolvency
and.
I think we've done very level so
I leave with the.
Minister for concurrence with
great skepticism about whether
or not we're doing nothing more
than kicking the can down the
road madam chairman I look for
better days ahead thank you for
the hard work you and your staff
and done madam speaker I
conclude my remarks.
The gentle lady from Travis
county Representative Ezzell.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentle lady from McKinley and
San Juan yield at yelp.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
quite a few of my questions have
been answered one of the ones
that.
I I had concerned about eight AM
Representative Crowder brought
that up it was a.
How close we were watching bills
that would have a negative
impact on our budget line.
Got first hand held that was
handles what do appreciate that
uniformed by doing that
I have no idea she's a full.
Madam speaker we have noise in
the background.
Thank you it's needed now.
And madam speaker for those that
are curious as I dress like this
today I'm in mourning for our
state Madam speaker.
And the.
Madam chairman of earlier on you
said that you were tired I
understand why you're tired you
all have worked tirelessly on
that but you might want to make
a pot of coffee because we heard
through the news media that
we're gonna run for twenty four
hours until we adjourn tomorrow
at noon.
Mr speaker Madam speaker and
gentle lady of.
I've got some questions that.
To most everybody else are not
important but to me they are
madam speaker this past year
with everything that did go on
In spite of all the projections
that were coming out of the LFC
and I do love reading the news
letters that were sent out they
were very informative for me.
But one more time those
industries.
Came through for the state and
for those projects that have now
been funded and that was the oil
and gas industry and the
agricultural industry and for
them we owe many thanks for the
state that we are in right now.
But I guess what we my concern
Madam speaker and gentle lady.
We started off the fiscal year
two thousand and twenty three
and our reserves were right at
thirty five and a half percent
is that correct Matt Madam
speaker and gentle lady are
madam speaker gentle lady that
is correct.
Okay that madam speaker and
gentle lady right now I'm also
reading.
That they had that that has been
dropped is projected to be like
twenty one point five percent
maybe just a shade higher is
that correct.
Madam speaker gentle lady yes
Representative because of what
our spending plan is for this
year but the other thing is is
that we want to you know make
sure that we stay within the
framework the budget guidelines
framework so it's
you know it's closer to the
twenty three percent.
Okay thank you very much for
that madam speaker gentle lady
of.
At the end of fiscal year twenty
one of twenty two.
Are those reserves going to go
back up to that thirty five
percent or they got to be around
twenty two percent.
Madam speaker gentle lady we
projected to be closer to twenty
four.
Two twenty four percent okay
well that's.
that.
The still troublesome to me you
know I'm one of these that I
always like to plan for a rainy
day and madam speaker can you
give me any sort of indication
what those reserves are going to
be below the twenty five percent
mark.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady when we're looking at with
our for our consensus revenue
process we also look at the out
years and we look at what we
think the the new revenues are
going to be and what we think
we're not going to have so it's
through this whole stress
testing and revenue projection
process is what part where we
come up with that number.
Okay madam speaker Jeff gentle
lady I I appreciate the response
there and
I do have to.
Tell you thank you doctor said
that I came in.
In the middle of the semester if
you want to call it that
I had heard it played catch up
but it's a fascinating process
what you and your how in tires
staff goes through to come up
with this budget and.
Everybody is having their hand
that it seems like we need a
little bit more money we don't
need a little bit more money and
now I can't remember which
Representative earlier addressed
the situation with our roads and
thank goodness there is more
money going to a red cent of
through a D. O. T. people of
just yesterday we found out that
there is been in this the
supervisor director name for.
DOT district to the which is
down in the southeastern part of
the state they do have more
roads than anybody else in the
state and I have to give them
kudos for the job that they do
and they always seem to come in
under budget and I do appreciate
the work that they are done down
there.
Madam speaker gentle lady out
that that's how we get grocery
store grocery store how we get
goods traveling throughout our
state help people do get to see
what is in our state and it does
help our tourism industry.
Madam speaker and gentle lady.
There is a couple of things that
I do want to discuss with you if
you don't mind and one of them
is of.
I've noticed that two million
dollars has been authorized but
by taxed rate of.
to implement the cannabis
legalization bill.
But the department of regulation
licensing.
then then they're going to have
the bulk of the responsibility
on this I feel.
Of.
There's nothing in the budget
for them to do this can you tell
me why that because of this
department that I just name
regulation licensing that they
don't have a budget increase.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady they money that's going to
be going to of the tax
department was actually an
executive ask and it's just set
up a new
program for them in their in the
tax tax administration and then
under our out R. O. date there
was not an executive asked we
don't usually put funding into a
budget.
It's all contingent upon bills
passing but we did not get we
did not get a request for them.
Okay so madam speaker and gentle
lady.
I know that it's.
I don't know what the Senate's
is done
Over there on their side
regarding the cannabis bill I
know that they've been working
on it so if there is a bill that
does pass out of both houses of
the governor does signed it into
law.
Will you see that the regulation
lossing department will be
requesting more funding to get
these programs running.
Speaker gentle lady yes and in
January when we come back into
session to work on the budget at
that time we would probably see
a either a supplemental or
special request from that
department
Madam speaker gentle lady I'm
not sure what the effective date
would be on those cannabis bills
are not posted those pieces of
legislation I don't know when
they actually kick in but it
would be in our next January
session when when the committee
gets together will be looking
out those special requests.
Okay well I was just kind of
curious there madam as.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
now I'm gonna go on to something
totally different and like I
said earlier this.
It this is something that has.
Peak my interest there and that
has to do with the state racing
commission.
And madam speaker this is a
vital industry to our state due
to the dollars that they do pay
into the state's budget which is
close to eight hundred million
dollars in two thousand and
nineteen.
Of with this.
Everything that happened last
year and racing does fall under
livestock.
There were two tracks that were
in full compliance.
With.
Them hosting the race meet they
did not have the benefit of
having those racetrack casinos
up and because of that emergency
orders that were put in place
these two tracks that did run
they had very limited spectators
the first half of the traces of
at the race meets there were no
spectators there.
And.
Madam speaker gentle lady of.
The jobs that were that are
created through the racing
industry.
Right now are not beneficial to
the state because there is no
grace track running at this time
there has not been sense of.
Mid December.
But yes the casinos are open and
running.
And according to statute that is
not allowed but the commission
the racetrack commit racing
Commission said yes that is
we're gonna let you go ahead and
open up some I'm bothered by
that Madam speaker and gentle
lady.
Do we see the probation that
have been made to their state
racing commission and all of
that is on page fifty seven of
do we see all of that.
Staying the same or is it going
to be.
Increased over the next year
because
With with no racing going on
until I think it's mid April
now.
There will be a seventeen day
mate and then.
The big seasons will start off
in the summer hopefully if
everything goes according to
Hoyle we're keeping our fingers
crossed on that do you see any.
Numbers that might be changing
their as far as next year's
budget goes.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady what you'll see
there is the the what this does
is it funds the agency
operations as as requested and
and based on on what we now and
the information that they
provided to us and and madam
speaker gentle lady we both kind
of at least you help me get my
toe in to the understanding of
of how this is supposed to work
this will be something what will
be us and looking into during
the LFC hearings this summer
because it is very interesting
when you're when these things
are supposed to happen and they
don't and you want to know
whether or not
the operations budget is still
correct.
And madam speaker and gentle
lady you're exactly right there
this not only affects tourism it
affects those.
Our breeders New Mexico our
breeders it does affect.
Everybody that is affiliated
with the service tracks madam
speaker and gentle lady and the
we've we're seeing a lot of.
Parameters and all their workers
that are no longer established
in the state of New Mexico
because they've had to go
elsewhere.
Madam speaker.
I have to take my hat off to you
and I'm not going to today
because of what I said I'm here
protesting I'm doing a peaceful
protest as far as what I'm
wearing today.
But I look forward to working
with you all summer long to
further understand this and I
think that are that the team the
to have.
Is done an outstanding job with
this so thank you very much for
your responses I do appreciate
it.
The gentleman from Chavis Eddy
and Otero leader Townsend.
Thank you Mr speaker Madam
speaker will the gentle lady of.
I'd be happy to yield madam
speaker.
Thank you gentle lady.
Couple of questions.
The.
The reserve number at twenty
three point eight or nearly
twenty four percent.
One question that I have been
asked.
Repeatedly and caucus and the
and
My constituents is that what
point.
In your opinion which I respect
what point is that.
Reserve number.
What is the critical critical
point for bonding and and other
issues at what point should our
state.
Be concerned with the reserve
number not from what you want or
not from what the governor wants
but from a financial point where
is the worst the tipping point
on reserves.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen you know from my
perspective and and that's not
with that and that's without us
all of our technical experts I
would become incredibly
incredibly concerned if it got
the low twenty I think anything
that you know twenty to twenty
five is a good good place to be
but anything below that I'd be
incredibly nervous about
probably would not support.
I appreciate that
Madam speaker and gentle lady
With regards to education.
There's there's a couple of
unanswered issues out there one
is the litigation risk of the
Yazzie Martinez.
District Court opinion.
And this is kind of two parts
one.
Do you think we have the address
that.
Adequately.
And to what do you believe.
The risky as if we have.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen I believe for this
year when we look at what we've
done in the tribal package that
was part of the junior bill.
And what we've done in terms of
increasing funding and and
dealing with the impact aid of
legislation which I just
received a text has passed the
Senate.
and within that bill if it's
signed into law by the governor
it allows those school districts
most impacted to be able to use
funds toward exactly what was
brought up in the Yazeed lawsuit
Yazzie Martinez lawsuit so I
feel for this fiscal year we've
done some yeoman's work in in
moving the needle toward
resolving that problem and madam
speaker gentle that
I I think it was critical
because these are the kinds of
things that can really crash
budget budgets if you get the
judgments that are unfavorable
and say particularly if they go
back several years it could cost
millions and millions of
dollars.
Thank you madam chair and gentle
lady I I
I continually.
Mexicans sign I think that we
all should share as at what
point is that adequately
addressed.
And what litigation risk we
might have to our state going
forward with respect to
education do you have.
can you tell me from.
Early childhood Kate through
twelve and higher ed how are are
expenditures compared to our
neighboring states.
Thank you Madam speaker and
gentleman it is higher without
question I know that we've seen
in and when you were serving on
HFC Madam speaker gentleman we
would state reports indicating.
The state's budget the
proportional share that is gone
through educ to gone to
education has always been
considerably higher.
And I think madam chair and
gentle lady that was you know
that was that this is an that
the legislature made long time
ago to really go after it but
when you look at it on a per
student basis.
I remember I think it was
Representative Dan do that that
a little research.
Two or three years ago I don't
remember exactly clean and then
I remember him reporting that
New Mexico spent about I think
it was about twelve to fifteen
hundred dollars per student more
in higher ed than neighboring
states.
is that still directionally
about right.
On madam speaker gentleman yes I
remember that report he shared
it with the whole committee
yes.
Another one as I'm going through
bills.
That are before us today there
is a Senate bill three fifteen
that's out there that plugs a
hole in state police retirement
that appropriation language was
stripped off of that bill is it
provided for in
H. B. two.
Thank you madam speaker general
yes so it was when it left the
house this is primarily when we
are trying to shore up the motor
trans
of employees you might remember
we have to move them under
public safety at one time they
were out of it an individual
department.
Thank you for that can madam
chair and and gentle lady what
is
You probably have roughed up
your head what is the Larranaga
rainy day fund balance
currently.
Speaker and gentleman we are
pulling that up for this so we
have a.
A accurate number but in the
hand out the paperwork that we
passed out.
Looking for the right page
number here just to take the
people for a.
It is
If you look at the reserve
detail.
madam speaker and members it's
under the tax stabilization
reserve rainy day fund.
And you look at what the
beginning balance is proposed
for FY twenty twenty two it's
one point one billion.
And with all the adjustments
because some of those funds are
transferred out B. over a
billion.
The page number on this madam
speaker but gentlemen if you and
I'm talking mainly to the
members it's the general fund
financial summary reserve
detail.
Thank you for that he'd be
I think you could probably be
amazed and proud of of.
I I don't think he ever thought
that it would be so much so
quick and I think there's about
sixty nine more of us that with
the said the same thing.
Gentlelady one last question on
Litigation reserves can you tell
me what we have in our budget
for litigation reserve.
madam speaker gentle but I I
guess I'm not completely aware
of what litigation reserve of
yes could you clarify please.
Madam speaker and gentle lady my
memory was that didn't we
Estimate.
Within the budget what.
Pending litigation we know you
might be out there and what I
risk was associated with that.
Yes.
Yes madam speaker gentle man and
that unfortunately I don't have
the accumulated number because
it's by department it sometimes
what what what we've done in the
past for the body is will.
We've had litigation in the hit
with Human Services with the
water mitigation things like
that but is broken down by
agency I don't have the
cumulative number.
Okay I will get through that and
find that Madam speaker gentle
lady thank you for that.
The gentle lady from Eddy County
Representative Brown.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentle lady from McKinley and
San Juan please yield.
I'd be happy to yield madam
speaker.
Thank you very much madam
speaker gentle lady.
So I gentle lady when I go back
to my district shortly
I'm gonna have to explain to my
constituents what the
legislature has done in terms of
the budget and how it affects
our state agencies.
the budget affects everyone in
New Mexico.
Any particular my concern is
what it does to the cost of
living in New Mexico so speaker
gentle lady I just like to bring
up a few subject areas and see
if you could summarize for me in
a couple sentences what you
might tell your constituents
about these particular subjects
so regarding taxes are Madam
speaker gentle lady what but we
tell them what we did I know
it's all about you know what
kind of revenue makes it into
the budget tax changes could
affect that what would you say
about that gentlelady.
My comments in regard to taxes
madam speaker and gentle lady
would be that
I haven't seen for this fiscal
year and major overhaul I know
that we've talked about it a lot
I've seen lots of
Lots of tweaking and lots of
shoring up but I but from my
perspective some of those things
such as elector I understand is
now banned approved into could
be continued I would talk about
how important that is to my
area.
Keeping that in place I think
that overall my general
statement would be I'm still
looking I'm still looking for
that overall particularly in
health gross receipts taxes.
Madam speaker generally so I I'm
concerned about gross receipts
taxes as well we know that when
they go up they lighten people's
wallets and their income doesn't
stretch as far so I know we've
had several pieces of
legislation moving through the
session I do we have an answer
has have gross receipts taxes
gone up because of of what the
legislature has done or have
they perhaps going down.
Yeah that's a good question
inside the budget of course we
don't deal with the tax measures
we don't deal with tax increases
what we do is we track the bills
are going through and how they
would affect the general fund
and those of bills of course
we've asked to have brought into
the committee so we can all look
at and review them but at this
point in terms of this bill in
this ammendment there's tax
increases or tax changes
Are not reflected.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentle lady.
so gas prices the to your
knowledge of gentle lady Madam
speaker are we going to see any
gas tax increases in New Mexico.
Madam speaker gentle lady I know
that there is a gas tax bill
that is coming from the Senate.
I would not imagine that that
was is going to happen I think
of the clock is running on and
many many bills are not going to
see the light of day and I don't
think that's going to happen.
Thank you the gentle lady then
speaker so we know that gas
taxes have bearing on our state
road fund and I just want to
talk about roads for a minute
it's my understanding that the
budget for the department of
transportation has broken the
one billion dollar mark this
year and I think that's
literally a milestone it means
that we're doing more road work
across New Mexico.
So gentle lady we know what
others money in the budget
I commend the D. O. T. for being
very judicious and prudent in
how it spends the money they do
make the most of it I believe
but I believe the Senate did
something did it not to increase
road funding gentlelady could
you explain that please.
Sure madam speaker gentle lady
HFC for state roads included a
hundred seventy million are a
workgroup identified projects
from various districts to be
funded Senate did the same thing
but the Senate also included an
additional two hundred million
from the federal stimulus into
the roads package.
The gentle lady Madam speaker is
it your understanding that that
extra two hundred million will
be distributed equally among the
transportation districts.
madam speaker gentle lady in all
of those discussions to in house
transportation that we've had
with the cabinet secretary that
is certainly the department's
intention they've got several
different funding sources.
Federal state funding and what
the plan is is to mix and match
these funds and have people
distribution to all six of the
districts.
Very good thank you gentle lady
and madam chairman.
So one of the complaints I
received this year is that with
the closure of of so many
The state agencies across the
street to to basically put
traffic in a lot of folks we're
getting their phone calls
answered there's a big concern
about the motor vehicle division
offices and those are under the
taxation and revenue department
I believe do you know if any
money has been put into the
budget of the Senate changed
anything about what House
Appropriations did to.
Bolster the funding for entities
so that we can start being more
responsive to citizen needs.
madam speaker gentle lady yes I
look at all of these
spreadsheets I don't see any
changes from Senate finance.
Very good thank you thank you
gentle lady.
Miss madam speaker gentle lady
I'm.
I'm very concerned about some
litigation over water in New
Mexico we've got a battling with
Texas oversee Rio Grande water
and this water litigation is
going to be critical to the
water of our state and the state
engineer the attorney general's
office I believe we're given
some additional money through
the house bill two to help them
mount a strong
cases they can do you know if
the Senate did anything to
detract from that funding or did
perhaps add to it.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady they did not make any
adjustments to the work we did
regarding water litigation I
think they just left it the way
it is when it left the house.
That's that's good news thank
you madam chair.
just a couple more questions and
I some of what I was going to
ask has already been addressed
through some earlier debate but
I guess what I would like to ask
about is the overall outcome for
our small businesses which are
really the backbone of our
economy in my opinion Madam
speaker gentle lady the small
businesses have taken up big
beating the session and I've
heard some people say well we're
making more money available to
businesses they can apply maybe
it's loan maybe it's a grant.
But that's kind of a one time
thing and maybe coming too late.
So
We're going to go home to our
districts and we're going to
hear from business owners.
And it's it's not gonna be easy
to hear much of what they're
going to say and I just don't
think
a lot of them are going to
recover so gentle lady if you
could
Tell me what you're going to
tell folks in your district I
know you're economic development
person.
so hi you have a very very good
read on we're businesses in New
Mexico what would you say.
Madam chair general Madam
speaker thank you madam speaker
thank you gentle lady well what
I am going to be looking forward
to is the stimulus dollars that
are going to come into New
Mexico there outside of this
budget
I have been in my my work back
home have been incredibly
concerned I mean we are
surrounded with major major
business closure and and large
industry closure in my home
county it's been a major up hill
battle
And I and I really am looking
forward to the stimulus funding
and also the work we did with U
Y. I think that does help
business
so they're not
charged additional fees I think
that's a good thing and I did
get a lot of response from back
home that they're really
supportive of that of that piece
of work that we all did in HSC.
Madam speaker and madam chair so
we we do agree about the
unemployment work that's been
done I sure hope it's it's truly
going to help but I'm I'm I
remain personally quite
concerned that the businesses
after a year of closure for so
many of them I just don't know
that we're going to have a.
A much of a future offered for
so many people and I think
that's really tragic
Madam speaker gentle lady let me
turn now briefly two I'd like to
also talk a little bit more
about the reserves
I'm looking at the general fund
financial summary it's part of
our package the cover page says
key hearing issues Senate
finance amendments to house bill
two.
And just to go over the numbers
again Madam speaker gentle lady
the reserves as a percent of
recurring appropriations we
started the session at reserves
of thirty five percent and a
little bit more.
Thanks for the estimate for
twenty twenty one down to twenty
one point seven percent and the
estimate for twenty two is
slightly improved to twenty
three point eight percent but I
noticed in the package
Madam speaker gentle lady that
we're tracking a number of bills
we don't know that they will get
through but I think you're about
seventeen of them and this is
found on the very last page of
this packet.
And if some of those.
Basically get through the
recurring spending would be
about six sixty five point six
million dollars.
And that's a lot of money
there's only one item in the
nonrecurring category we don't
worry so much about nonrecurring
because we understand it's all
one time but madam speaker
gentle lady sixty practically
sixty six million dollars and if
that happens that reserve number
of twenty three percent cannot
be accurate
so gentle lady could you just
say a few words about that
please.
Thank you madam speaker and
thank you gentle lady that's
exactly right when you look at
the FY twenty two reoccurring
amount there of course when we
do our revenue projections we
base them on the information we
know all and at that point we
don't know what will get past
what doesn't get past help
things are changed in the
process so this would be and be
booked against the reserve.
Being that some of these things
are neutral or that they
actually bring money in and
looks like it there's a couple
of them that will do that I
think at the end of the day
we'll see a new
a new of of financial summary
and a new reserve number.
But we're not sure how many of
these things are actually going
to get through the process.
Thank you madam chair and madam
speaker so I think it makes
perfect sense to have reserves
of twenty five percent or higher
and so I'm just I'm just
concerned it affects our bond
rating which affects the cost of
public projects and learn
anything on being on the
Appropriations Committee is that
that reserve amount really does
matter.
So madam chair I'm going to just
a close with once again thanking
you for your leadership on the
committee of the house
appropriations and finance
I just a truly value your
knowledge of your leadership.
And
I will support the budget it's a
little higher than I wanted it
to be after the Senate at its
and spending.
I'm concerned that the federal
money is
I come here in in the sense that
it's here for a little bit we
won't probably see it again and
we get our spending up in our
expectations up.
And then we put ourselves in the
position of maybe having to cut
the budget and that's painful
for for everybody so we know
that the major source of funding
oil and gas.
Is very volatile that industry
has been put in the crosshairs
with some regulations that in my
opinion would harm the industry
would not actually improve the
environment so part of moving
pieces but gentle lady you've
done an outstanding job of
leadership and I also believe
that senator Munoz on the Senate
side and finance.
It is a is a good person and
between the two of you I think
we have a budget that.
that many of us can vote for so
thank you very much Madam
speaker gentle lady.
The gentle lady from Dona Ana
Representative Gallegos thank
you madam speaker this matter
having been debated for three
hours I move the debate sees
there's been a motion to close
debate all those in favor please
signify by saying hi.
Those supposed may.
Debate is now closed the gentle
lady from McKinley and San Juan
chairwoman Lundstrom could you
please restate the motion.
Thank you madam speaker I'd also
like to thank the body I
certainly appreciate the
questions there's nothing more
important in my mind then the
state's budget I think it's
important that these questions
are here and discussed because
it helps the public understand
what we're actually doing and
with that being said Madam
speaker again I would like to
encourage the body to confer
with the Senate amendments to
house appropriations and finance
committee substitute for House
Bill to.
We have a motion to concur with
the Senate amendments to house
appropriations and finance
committee substitute for house
bill two and three as amended
all those in favor of the motion
to concur signify by saying hi.
And may.
Concurrent with the Senate
amendments you are the House
Appropriations Committee sub for
House Bill two and three as
amended.
Yes the gentleman from
Bernalillo county Representative
Martinez ready.
Madam speaker I'm ready.
I'm we're on item three of the
concurrence calendar.
The capital outlay re
authorizations of the Senate
finance committee amended.
Representative Martínez could
you explain the amendments yes
thank you madam speaker the
motion is going to concur with
Senate amendments to house bill
two ninety six the re
authorization bill.
To amendments to technical fixes
one of
ads
strikes the word project manager
and gives an amount of up to one
point seven million dollars to
help with operating purposes at
the space for the second
amendment adds
language for the money to a
chapter of the Navajo Nation to
use a twenty nineteen
appropriation to partisan
equipped vehicles instead of
purchasing and equipping a motor
grader and with that explanation
madam speaker I move that the
house speaker would Senate
amendments to house bill two
ninety six.
There is a discussion.
The gentleman from Sandoval
Representative Harper.
Thank you madam speaker does the
kind gentleman from Bernalillo
yield.
I yield to the gentle from
someone.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman my apologies I just
took a drink of water and I went
on the wrong path.
So Mister speaker and and Madam
speaker and gentleman.
So this is the capital.
Only reauthorization we we pass
this through the house.
And it contains I want to see
was about a hundred projects
reauthorization Mr speaker and
gentleman is do you do you
happen to have that off the top
of your head is that about
right.
is speaking German I believe
that's about right.
Yeah Mr us.
Madam speaker John I've I've I
believe we had about a hundred
projects in there and these
were.
will develop west the house and
the Senate because of the
speaker John I I remember there
are several items in my neck of
the woods that
The senator the gentleman from
Santa had had taken care of.
So Mr Chairman this this was
done jointly west the Senate
before left the house on like
capital outlay staff.
Crispier and gentleman Mr
Chairman.
Yes it is Mr chair and get on
with.
Right so this semester and and
gentlemen you said there were
two.
Amendments that were made in the
Senate
thank you please repeat repeat
repeat those two I've I guess I
was choking on water I
apologize.
Yes madam speaker and and
gentlemen so that the that there
two amendments one of them
is in section seventy nine and
it strikes the words a project
manager and instead allows the
spaceport to expand up to one
point seven million dollars well
they prior twenty nineteen
appropriation for operating
purposes the fix the technical
fix really was trying to narrow
down the the the the the nature
of which the for which they
appropriation can be used hands
striking the words project
manager and instead allowing a
certain amount of money to be
used for operating purposes the
the amount of money to be used
as one point seven million
dollars I understand the
appropriation in twenty nineteen
was actually for nineteen
million of which there are
fifteen million left the second
amendment
simply changes language are for
and appropriation to the money
only to chapters the Navajo
Nation in McKinley county to use
a twenty nineteen appropriation
to purchase any equipped
vehicles instead of purchasing
and equip equipping a motor
grader all those are the two
amendments that are made in this
into ninety six my Madam
speaker.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo sake you that for the
the the more detailed
description of those amendments.
I I was not aware that we had a
did you say was roughly nineteen
million capital appropriation in
two thousand nineteen to the
spaceport to make sure that
right Mattis the gentleman yes
and I believe that that was
probably a statewide allocation
out of the statewide framework
from twenty nineteen.
Okay then speaker and gentleman
thank you for that that would
have been a lot of members
pooling their money together to
come up with a.
Nineteen million to so the
economic sense there was a
statewide.
And by striking
project manager it's only
freeing up one point seven five
million of that nineteen million
is that correct.
Thank you Mr Terry all.
Thanks for being on the other
that four work we all the
people.
I'm I'm sorry Madam speaker and
gentleman I think some was
omitted
I believe the change was made
because they were trying to give
and by they I I believe this is
an executive
re off initially they're trying
to give the space for a little
bit more flexibility to use
funding for operations but they
realize that perhaps they were
giving maybe too much I'm not
sure I'm not privy are and so
they instead of allowing for
project manager they just allow
up to a certain amount of money
for operating purposes.
Yeah Matt madam speaker and
gentleman from Bernalillo that
have that makes sense to me it
it looks to me like by striking
those three words.
This one point seven five
million bears are out of the
nineteen they're they're
essentially able to.
Freed up for other things but
the other the balance of that
nineteen million dollars
unchanged the the how it's been
dedicated how it's been set up
there's no impact on that is
that correct Mr speaker John
that is that that is correct
madam speaker and gentleman.
Right to us thank you madam
speaker and gentleman.
I I I've been to a the space for
once he was a really fun trip.
I I sure do hope that some day
the the space for really takes
off.
we certainly have spent a lot of
taxpayer money on that beautiful
facility.
So if this is helpful.
then then that sounds like a
good change to me.
Okay so Madam speaker.
The gentleman the the second.
what you mentioned here I guess
there's a.
was it a Manuelito chapter of
the Navajo Nation I pronounce
that right Madam speaker John.
Madam speaker gentleman yes.
All right now speaker and
gentleman this was.
Again a two thousand nineteen
appropriation.
To purchase the motor grader do
you know.
then speaker and gentleman did
they actually purchased that and
these were excess dollars the
aids that they got more than
they needed or was cheaper than
they thought or they decided
they don't need this motor
grader.
Thank you Jim and I'm not I'm
not sure of the detail of the
appropriation from twenty
nineteen.
Okay Mister chairman I just I
just mentioned that
Because I think I I mentioned
earlier on the capital outlay
bill that.
members need to be careful and
watch their their projects
because often if they are
completed and they have left
over dollars.
they can pull those back and it
appropriates into something else
and madam speaker and gentleman
we we in the Sierra County
delegation did that this year we
had several Rio Rancho public
school projects that were
completed and they came in under
budget which is to be commended
and so we actually took all
those dollars and then re
appropriated them to cover the
two projects through principal
school district asked us to help
them with this year.
And so we were able to help out
the district by simply washing
those dollars and because was re
authorization so I was just
curious if that was.
The case here for for this
chapter of the Navajo Nation but
I I appreciate that
That that might be too for the
weeds massacre job
So
Speaker and.
Gentleman.
once we've.
The.
on this.
what we'll be doing do we see a
difference in the bottom line
appropriations or balance of
items that are affected in this
legislation.
madam speaker gentleman I don't
believe we should know.
Yeah Mentzer gentleman that was.
That was my impression but I'm
just I'm just.
No looking through the.
The FIR here and into it I just
wanted to double check said
we're not.
These amendments are not adding
new things they really are just
striking some language
redirecting funds.
Yeah I think I agree with you.
Yeah and it looks like for this
year the toll appropriations are
twenty point four million.
no those are all the projects
listed okay.
so madam speaker and gentleman.
R. what would happen if
But we didn't have these re
authorizations in place I mean
are you familiar that there's a
time limit for wind cap what we
projects can be.
spent.
Yes Madam speaker gentleman that
there there are time limits I
believe it's two years for
planning and design and I think
it's for five years for you know
brick and mortar construction
the bill itself is full of those
steps of re authorizations that
we've all done
and so these two amendments
really are are what we you know
what bring us to to concurrence
what would happen if the bill
didn't pass I'm assuming some of
the money would revert other
projects could not be re
directed
you know that that that thing
that that's what would happen
but the yes I believe it's two
in four years depending on the
type of allocation.
Madam speaker and gentleman I
believe you're you're exactly
correct and I I just bring this
up especially for new members to
understand I believe it's
roughly five years what used to
for brick and mortar you know.
Planning design might be
somewhat different but it's
possible if you have
appropriated Madam speaker and
gentleman money to a project.
And we you know we leave this
chamber you know the governor
signs it and we go home and we
see great that's done but if
it's not perhaps is shovel ready
as we thought and it perhaps
doesn't get moving as quickly as
we thought you could be you know
a bunch of an I. five years
later and all the sun that money
reverts and you don't get notice
the speaker and gentle Madam
speaker and gentleman from from
LESC or from anywhere that that
money is reverted so it's really
important every year.
Madam speaker and gentleman to.
Call up and hello
the Legislative Council Service
and say can you just look after
the capital outlay bureau and
ask and say can you please look
through my projects and let me
know if anything.
needs to be included in the re
authorization.
and speaker and and and master
John I've also learned that in
the past I seems distant past
that members who were really on
top of their projects the other
members who were on top of this
would actually.
Kind of siphon money away that
were reverted.
And put it in their own
districts.
Mr and and John and and I don't
I'm not sure that happens
anymore but I just want to let
members be aware.
They really need to be on top of
this isn't just a you know
reauthorization bill check the
box good this really could have
a big impact if you're not
watching your items making sure
they're not reverting and also
like I said earlier making sure
that when you have extra money
or maybe a project is not moving
and enough money still somewhere
else this is that the means to
do it you really need to self
initiate.
Yeah and and Mr speaker and
gentleman I had another good of
recommendation to mention to the
new members from the others
gentlelady from Santa.
If you're new in your seat.
This isn't the first time
capital outlay has been on
authorized or or set up your
district you likely have a big
list of projects from your
predecessors Madam speaker and
gentleman so
it would behoove you to call up
legislative finance committee I
just ask them can I have a list
of all of my.
All the projects are active in
my district and then go through
that list and make sure.
You know call the caller from
agencies and say what's the
update on this and really make
sure this these dollars are
moving and put some pressure on
them to move these dollars.
Mr Chairman
any any of.
Any other words of wisdom from a
the the chair of that tax and
revenue Mr Chairman.
No.
And you covered out we cover all
the bases it's very important
for the members to understand
and to to stay in touch stay on
top of the local governments and
top with the FAA and LFC to make
sure your funds are allocated
are spent the way that you and
then vision them when you
allocated then.
Speaker and gentleman thank you
for that and I think I'll just.
This close by mentioning
masseter and Angelman.
That.
You know as you go forward
you know the legislature has
been accused of having this you
know one point four billion
dollar balance of unexpended
capital outlay and it it's not
like it's just money out there
that hasn't been appropriated
we've all appropriated it we all
have our print projects that
that money is going towards.
But if we can't change that
conversation by being proactive
enough money in the ground we're
gonna continue to be subject to
that criticism and eventually
they'll come a time when we no
longer will be given that
authority all the other people
then speaker John that's a you
know.
A board or or some some groups
will end up taking our our
capital Ellie dollars in
deciding how to distribute them
Mr Chairman has been proposals
bills drops to do just that.
Mr Jones a gentleman I I.
Is pros and cons that approach
but I personally feel like I
know what's best for my district
and I don't want some small
panel of people to dictate
where throughout the state
these are should go I should as
the representative of my
district I should have that say
so I just want everyone please
be on top of your capital outlay
projects uses reauthorization
pool and and and what's the to
try to get more of that one
point four billion dollars into
the ground so we can avoid that
criticism
with that then speaker John I
really appreciate the time thank
you I yield.
The gentleman from Lee
Representative Scott.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentleman from Bernalillo you.
The gentle lady.
Engine one.
To read the special support
issue just richly could you
describe again exactly what
happened.
Left out of the past version
that went over it was.
Currently stands.
Yes I'd be glad to.
Speaker and gentleman from eight
of the language in the re
authorization bill as it left
the house was to give the
spaceport some flexibility in to
allow them to use some of the
funds that were allocated for
some of the operations of the
entity
upon analysis by the Senate
committees and conversation with
the executive it was determined
that up what they really needed
to do was to if they were gonna
get flexibility to the spaceport
for operations is too tied up to
a specific dollar amount and not
to and to not leave it so open
ended so the amendments that was
place in Senate finance
committee strikes the words a
project manager and instead
allows a spaceport to expand up
to one point seven five million
dollars of that twenty nineteen
appropriation for operating
purposes so ineffective time's
up the language they can still
use it for operations but it's
much more limited than the way
the language was previously
written.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
I think that's what I heard the
first time.
So the question is there was a
nineteen million dollar capital
allocation made apparently
several years ago for the
spaceport is that accurate.
Mr Madam speaker and gentleman I
believe that was the case if
memory serves me right I believe
that it was a twenty nineteen
appropriation well first of all
let me back up this language in
his re authorization bill
specific to twenty nineteen
appropriations so the year is
accurate I believe the amount is
roughly nineteen million dollars
give or take and my
understanding is that there are
about fifteen million dollars
remaining in that allocation of
the amendment again allows a
space for to utilize up to one
point seven five million dollars
for operating purposes.
Madam speaker and gentleman
which funds for relief recent
form me standing up.
This capital dollars or normally
one time expenditures and
project oriented and that does
not appear to be the case with
respect to the page both with
respect to the spaceport where
this one point seven million
dollars is going to be expended
for corporations which surrounds
Warrick.
Current expense could you could
you elaborate on.
What the differences in how we
got here.
Yeah madam speaker and gentleman
so I first of all I've been
corrected the appropriation
amount was actually sixteen
million and there's fifteen
million remaining I should also
note that all of that is general
fund money so we're not using
STBs to paper operations as far
as whether or not it's you know
recurring I I you know I I I
would say that this is
definitely not recurring because
this money is a one time
allocation and you know for
future recurring dollars some
I'm assuming the space for would
have to come in the state and
ask for that through the house
bill two process.
Nonetheless Madam speaker and
gentleman.
Appropriations would imply
something besides a capital
project.
Would not be accurate this is.
Sounds like operating expenses
rather than a capital project.
Is that correct.
This
I believe that's what the
reauthorization language was
allowing the space for to do and
the amendment that it we're
debate that we're discussing
right now Stein's up the
language so that there's a
specific dollar amount
associated with that
flexibility.
And madam speaker gentleman are
we doing.
Are we doing capital outlay re
authorizations for any other
projects outside of the
spaceport for operations.
Madam speaker and gentleman
that I'm not entirely sure there
about ninety four other projects
in the original bill I'm not
sure if any of those.
I think stability for operations
if they do they would need to be
from the general fund but I'm
not sure if there are others in
the original bill.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you to the same somewhat unusual
but I believe I can supported
thank you madam speaker thank
you gentleman from Bernalillo.
Thank you general.
The gentleman from grant Hidalgo
in Sierra Representative Dow.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentleman yield please.
A year to the generally.
Madam speaker and gentleman I
will certainly be concurring on
this bill and I hope that the
body will to what concerns me is
how it ended up in our taxation
and revenue committee substitute
for House Bill to ninety six and
why this critical one point
seven million dollars I think
this base point request was two
million dollars why didn't come
from the general fund.
madam speaker and gentle lady I
I don't know.
Madam speaker and and gentleman
I feel year after year that I've
been here in this body the space
port has been an afterthought
well year after year the entire
world is looking at the new
space industry and the new space
economy and.
Headline after headline is that
the new space economy is on the
edge of a lift off my freshman
year the space industry a new
space economy was around one
point are to be two point twenty
five billion dollars a year this
year then twenty twenty exceeded
over four hundred billion dollar
investment and it's projected to
be
over five hundred billion this
year nearing a trillion dollars
a year in in just and that the
next few years and madam speaker
and gentleman
this is traditionally been
something that the government's
invested in primarily
governments NASA the department
of defense type things but there
are rising public sector
investments and positions in
space exploration that are
driving this next trillion
dollar industry and for whatever
reason Madam speaker and
gentleman people refer back to
this initial two hundred million
dollar capital investment that
happened under governor
Richardson and call it a
boondoggle and call it a wasted
investment.
Mr speaker I mean Madam speaker
and gentleman how much does the
the state of New Mexico
traditionally it wasn't this
this last minute amendment into
the taxation revenues committee
substitute for house bill ninety
six how much of Madam speaker
and gentleman yield does the
spaceport usually ask for for
their general operating.
Madam speaker and gentle lady I
don't know the answers to that
but I do want to make it clear
for the body this is not a last
minute amendments so usually
what happens is council service
will work with individual
provided towards and the
executive on any capital re
authorization request council
service will then put to be
built together in the meantime
what we do as sponsors of these
bills as we we we we filed the
bill right so that's why there's
a there's a house bill ninety
six and then when that re
authorization bill drafting
processes is finished we saw
that bill into the sitting bill
in this case the original house
bill two ninety six so this is
not a last minute deal that was
just inserted into this bill
this was part of the entire
process for the last fifty nine
days and then the amendment that
we're here debating during this
current debate is really with
regard to striking the words
project manager and then
inserting a dollar amount that
can be used by the space for for
operating purposes.
Madam speaker and gentleman I
would have to disagree with you
on that that of prior
appropriation which was needing
re authorization we're saying
around nineteen million dollars
I do believe that's right it's
for a visitor center to be built
at the spaceport and now we are
carving out one point seven
million that was needed for
capital and we are using it for
operation Madam speaker and
gentleman that is what is
happening here so will they
still be able to complete the
visitor center when they are now
short one point seven million
dollars of what was needed for
the project management of that
project will they still be able
to complete the visitor center
with this year's appropriation.
Madam speaker and gently
that is a difficult question to
answer primarily because I'm not
sure if there's more money in
the capitol outlay bill that
individual legislative force may
have contributed to
and not knowing the full amount
that the need for this visitor
center and not knowing the
specifics of the twenty nineteen
appropriation yeah it is nearly
an impossible question for me to
respond to again you know this
was
this is this what the language
that we're talking about here
right now is with regard to the
amount of money one point seven
five million for operating
purposes you know I I I I
totally hear your concerns being
the representative of that
community but you know that's
what we have here in front of us
so if you have the actual number
you know I I'd love to hear it
but that so that's where we're.
Madam speaker and and gentlemen
I am telling you the number it's
nineteen million dollars
developed by the visit to build
the visitor center that was a
year ago and because of what
occurred at spaceport America
over the last year and the
shuffling of CFO's the executive
director the restructuring of
the spaceport the board space
for thirty board and putting
things on hold they were not
able to implement the project is
desperately needed and now they
will be one point seven million
dollars when the time comes not
accounting for the rising costs
some of which this body is
responsible for imposing on them
that Mr speaker and and I mean
Madam speaker and gentleman
what.
What I do want the body to know
is that it the the bad rap in
the the boondoggle.
Wrap that spaceport America gets
is far from accurate they ask
for two million dollars a year
to deal with their operations
they have an eight million
dollar year annual operating
budget that's it the two hundred
million dollar investment in the
capital infrastructure out there
is over a decade old it's now
over sixteen years ago I'm sorry
yes sixteen years ago with their
maybe we could send a
representative and since that
time they ask for eight million
dollars a year in annual
operating six million of that
comes from customer fees there
are customers that pay fees for
use as a spaceport America they
only needed two million dollars
a year from us that's that's
over sixty seven percent of
their annual operating budget
comes from customer fees and
they're fighting over pinneys
for general operating and just
for Dona ana county alone the
customer payroll for New Mexico
is over twenty million dollars a
year not counting virgin which
is over twenty five million a
year the customer construction
that was invested over the last
few years over fifty million
dollars not urgent but another
customer spent over twenty five
thousand dollars a week for six
months just in hotel and
restaurant these for their the
research and development that
they did out there and Sierra
County we were literally kept
alive the county of Sierra's G.
R. T. was literally kept alive
by the private investment the
customer investment at spaceport
spaceport America and and just
virgin who I know was struggling
and they are not they are the
anchor tenant at this time but
they don't have to be if we
would use our imagination and
innovation if we would look at
space investments as the new
frontier they have sold over
sixteen million dollars of
houses were sold to new virgin
galactic employees in Dona ana
county alone just in twenty
twenty Dona ana county has two
hundred new jobs in the state
these are jobs that start at
sixty five thousand dollars a
year and over sixty percent of
those are local New Mexico hires
and what they're.
Asking for us to million a year
in our general operating budget
and many more maybe it should be
more I mean according to all the
research on the the new space
economy this is where we are
going to solve climate change is
how we're going to be creating
self sufficient eco systems it's
where we are evolving our
business models security defense
telecommunications and what we
don't even know even as we
speak.
Mars rover preservation's is a
rise and it's explanation to
provide evidence of life on
Mars.
Investors are exploring the
markets the forces the
technology and the imagination
is driving new space age and we
cannot even see what's not in
front of us you know just is in
my neck of the woods I can go
see it there are cranes their
concrete trucks out there every
day delivering concrete for more
landing pads there's an
incredible structure out there
that is larger than the statue
of liberty that uses speed and
forced to launch satellites sub
orbital at without fuel there is
a three hundred foot glider out
there that is it state sub
orbital for six months at a time
projecting providing the
resources to project I need over
two hundred mile radius that can
provide much needed access to
internet in our rural areas and
so it's just it's it's really
frustrating
to see spaceport fight over two
million dollars in general
operating and now to see it come
out of their capital investment
that they really do need I don't
think
so I just I mean sorry to just
the letter just to talk about
this for so long but it's it's
a.
We need to be.
We have the opportunity right
now is New Mexico to leave the
new space economy R. I. twenty
five corridor we have over a
hundred and thirty five new
space investors this could
become the Silicon Valley this
basic funny and we probably
should remember that Bill Gates
was not welcomed his business
was not welcome in New Mexico
and he ended up in California
you on musk business not welcome
any Mexico he ended up in
California we need to take the
opportunity that we have to make
New Mexico the New Silicon
Valley is basic economy and give
space port the attention it
deserves and make the attempt at
the investment deserves I am of
course going to concur on this
because without the one point
seven million we cannot assure
that the customers out there
we'll have the twenty four hour
safety and security an EMT
services that they need for
their very volatile and high
risk research and development
that's happening and so I do
thank you madam speaker and
Representative for bringing this
bill and I will concur thank
you.
Members of the house just a
reminder to tried to speak to
the amendments.
the gentleman from curry county
Representative Crowder.
Thank you madam speaker will the
Tax rate chairman please yield.
I yield to the gentleman from
curry.
Thank you John gentleman I I
don't know that anyone is asked
and I don't think I heard you
have an expert witness helping
you today are you flying solo.
Offline solo Madam speaker and
gentleman I do have a Stevie
also from the LFC on my text
message urgent thread though in
case I need him.
Misterioso is an excellent
expert witness Mr chairman and
and as I go through this I I
think I have a tremendous
learning opportunity in front of
me and I want to take that
opportunity to to dig out all I
can from this so madam speaker
gentleman's as I read through
the FIR.
We started off with ninety four
projects that we were looking at
to a project a section eighty
and eighty one were taken out
rolled up into seventy nine.
So we lost to projects right
there would be down to ninety
two but we added into another
project in McKinley county.
The Navajo Nation projects we're
talking now about ninety three
projects after the amendment is
that correct Mr speaker and
gentleman.
the speaker and and gentleman I
don't know that the number of
projects changed will will check
that out for you here though
keep in mind the money amount
doesn't change this is money
that was appropriated already do
these projects for just changing
the use both the spaceport by by
one point seven five million and
then we're changing the use for
that one in McKinley county
from one type of vehicle to
another type of vehicle.
Thank you Jonathan I I arrived
at ninety three projects by
starting with ninety four you
took eighty in eighty one and
rolled up into seventy nine so
those two projects workforce of
practice which added and the
Navajo so there was a net loss
of one so we went from ninety
four to ninety three projects
and gentleman Mister speaker I
do agree that started at fifty
seven point nine million it's
still at fifty seven point nine
million is that accurate.
Yes Sir this.
Thank you gentleman
I found myself becoming very
very curious as I begin to look
at this.
We hear every year when we hear
a reauthorization package or we
talk about capital outlay we we
talk about the projects that
have been hanging out there for
years and years and years the
Ben Ray authorized two three
four five times so Mr speaker
gentleman of these ninety three
projects.
Can you or your analyst let me
know.
How many of them were.
Three years old from the
original authorization how many
were four years old how many
were five years old how many
were six years old.
I'm I'm just curious.
What kind of a trend line it
would create if we begin to look
at that.
Madam speaker gentleman that is
a wonderful question but that is
not pertinent to the two
amendments in front of us.
thank you gentlemen I I would
disagree we amended this and
that went from ninety four
projects to ninety three
projects.
And so it does affect how many
projects are out there because
we have less projects I would
also Mr speaker and gentleman be
curious.
As we look at these projects now
that we have a final project the
final product is come back to us
from the Senate it's a good time
to stop and analyze the this
bill and how it affects it's a
great learning tool for us.
One hour I would be curious also
like interrupt so concurrence is
not the time to explore the
entire bill for purposes of
learning it is time to explore
what amendments.
The Senate has asked us to can
current and confine your
questions to propose amendments
please thank you gentlemen thank
you Mr speaker I was just under
the impression that if the
amendment change the context of
the bill that we could ask
questions about the bill and
that that's what I was trying to
do I and Mr speaker let me
approach it a little different
way and I'll make a request.
Of the analyst and and the
chairman if that's fair because
we now have a new product that
we're looking at I know we got
bills coming over that they've
taken out thirty five pages of
put in thirty five new pages and
it totally changes things this
one has a minimal change but it
is an opportunity for this body
to have a tremendous learning
experience.
John again and I don't mean to
keep repeating this is not an
opportunity for the body to
learn about the entire bill.
Yeah the body can learn from
what is in the amendment to
confine yourself to the
amendment otherwise we're simply
repeating the debate on the bill
itself so I'm asking you to
confine yourself to the
amendment.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Gentleman I I
I was mistaken I thought we had
a great opportunity learned are
always wrong.
Saw we're not going to get to
find out.
Geographically where the money
went we're not going to find out
how it breaks down.
And I guess I'll ask those
questions of some other time are
given I would give with your
analyst after this is over and
see if I can learn from it thank
you Mr speaker thank you John.
Thank.
There is further debate the
gentle lady from Chavis
Representative Ezzell.
Mr speaker thank you very much
will the gentleman yield yield
to the gentle lady from Chavis.
Mr speaker gentleman of.
Whenever we first got this bill
I was writing it out capital
outlay for each particular
county I wanted to do a side by
side and of obviously number one
was Bernalillo second was Santa
Fe County.
Third was Dona Ana County fourth
was Santa San Juan was stiff.
Six was McKinley County seventh
was Rio or read the county eight
was of terra county and the city
north was grant.
With task being number ten as
far as the capital out outlay
projects go I guess the loser in
all of this unfortunately of was
capturing County.
And Mr speaker this was very
enlightening to me and I'm just
gonna make a snarky little
comment right here on the floor
because I had one made towards
meet earlier.
And Mister speaker I guess these
some of these counties that are
in the top ten are the same
counties.
This is we don't want any
exploration done in our
counties.
Mr speaker it's.
Due to the industry that we have
working in the southeastern part
of the state that some of these
projects are funded but now I
will go to the changes that are
in this bill Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Many years ago I was a member of
the NMFA oversight committee we
held and interim meeting at tier
C. and there was a presentation
done by spaceport America.
And they had their budget their
vote all they were done they
were so excited to show us what
was going on down there.
And I've heard the term Madam
dog goals mentioned many times
during this debate Mr speaker
and gentleman.
And I'm want to really look over
numbers I'm just that type of
person.
And whenever it came to.
One of the items on the budget
which is the fencing and I I
apologize Mr speaker and
gentleman I can't remember the
number that was giving given.
For the cost of financing.
And basically that product that
property that the state bar was
a little over twenty six
sections.
Mr speaker for those of you all
that don't know what a section
is it is six hundred and forty
acres.
A square mile is what is section
is consisting of.
And I was.
The standard of the cost of see
saw there it was.
About four point seven million
dollars not could be off on that
I know it was a big big map so I
questioned I said okay is this
high fencing that you.
Had.
Put it R. F. P. L. for to have
the whole ranch hi Spence
because of the wildlife issues
that might impede any sort of
operations at spaceport America
money and of.
Mr speaker and gentleman imagine
how I might look astonishment on
my face.
Whenever they said oh no we did
not fill this out the whole
ranch.
We feel it's the wrong way area
which is the equivalent of six
hundred and forty acres.
Six hundred and forty acres Mr
speaker for those of you all
that have gone to sleep now.
that's one square mile.
Four point seven million dollars
Mr speaker I then proceeded to
ask if those corner post recette
and solid gold.
Mr speaker.
We are now giving them.
One point seven five.
For up for operations at I'm
just Andrew this is bleeding
gonna stop Mr speaker and
gentleman.
there's comes a point when ever.
We keep funding and we keep
signing and we keep signing and
they keep coming back to us with
their hands out Mr speaker.
In my opinion.
They need star standard non
there a.
Mr speaker the taxpayers of the
state of New Mexico.
Are tired of taking on different
loads.
That is not beneficial to them
and is really not beneficial to
the state Mr speaker gentleman
thank you for letting me vent I
do intend to support this
because of the projects that are
important to those people that
do send the money up here for
other counties to be able to
share thank you very much.
Right there is further debate
the gentleman Colfax curry hardy
quite Roosevelt San Miguel and
you Representative Chatfield
thank you Mr speaker this
gentleman yield.
I got to yield to the gentleman.
Thank you Mr speaker German.
It's a it's enjoyable get up and
talk about this a little bit
today many times these projects
are the life blood of the small
communities.
And when I look at the ones that
have been added the and I know
that sometimes there are
reversions maybe somebody
doesn't quite complete their
project Mr speaker gentleman I
wondered if some of the funding
that went into these new
projects was a result of
reversions from small projects.
All madam all Mr speaker German
no no both of these allocations
were from up from twenty
nineteen.
so you know well before any
reversion takes place.
So Mister speaker gentleman
that's good I I really hate to
see anyone
lose their funding for a project
or
not be able to complete that
project I worked in this area
quite a quite a lot before I
came here there's a lot of goes
in to get this project off the
ground permits be is getting out
the project engineering tell you
rather ways public support.
landowners.
Of all those things depending on
the type of project they go into
putting one of these projects on
the ground.
So Mr speaker gentleman's of one
of the things that I wasn't
aware of before I came here at
as a legislator is that there
they put out a list each year of
the projects that are that are
going to revert.
Actually in my own experience my
first project that I ever worked
on the
It wasn't the first one but I
got a call from from a
neighboring agency and said they
had a had some money was going
to revert and they needed
matching funds and without
hassle up those funds got the
information for that.
Ject to be not reverted we put
it on the ground but as a as a
legislator Mr speaker gentleman
each year you will get a list
and if you're very careful and
pain watch that list I I take
money and I go down to that
through there and I see any
projects of.
Are coming up against our three
year limit.
And I call those folks on the
phone and I I talked to them
about what it takes to get that
thing done so they don't lose
our money because as I said when
I started there these days these
projects are the are the
lifeblood of our communities I
oftentimes find water roads
infrastructure posted jobs are
brought into the community by so
Should you bring this bill Mr
speaker and gentleman I will be
voting for thank you.
Thank you.
There is further debate the
gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln representative Nibert.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman from Bernalillo county
yield.
I yield to the gentleman from
Chavis and Lincoln.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen.
When I first came to this body
of I was not.
Real familiar with capital
outlay of and it's the the
breadth of things that it can be
applied for but I was familiar
with how we did things in my
county is a county commissioner
of the things that we had
specifically requested and it
always seemed to me that capital
outlay requests to legislators
were.
Focused on those capital items
that had some duration things
that could be around awhile and
it was always impressed upon me
by by the legislators who were
serving in this body at that
time the the project should be
things that out with of any
bonding that may be associated
with the we're capital outlay
and so always viewed capital
outlay is as a process by which
local governments and and other
entities would request.
More or less bricks and mortar
for lack of a better term things
that will last for years
and and we even really frowned
upon of things that depreciated
quickly such as such as vehicles
but I noted in your responses Mr
speaker and gentleman that one
of the amendments involve the
change.
From a road grader to
automobiles and so my question
is it is it.
In your experience of Mr speaker
and gentleman is a quite common
to use capital outlay funds for
what I would consider
Items that have less duration
and may be items that depreciate
thoroughly rapidly.
This is speaker and and
gentlemen you know I I that's a
fantastic question I I I tried I
tried to fund almost exclusively
with my allocation bricks and
mortar just out of my own
philosophy but I do know that a
lot of other institutions
schools you know senior centers
or whatnot might come in for for
other things that you know I've
I've had and I've had requests
for example right and and I mean
that's in my opinion not not
appropriate.
I don't know you know what the
number percentage of of these
allocations go to those types of
purchases
with the with the specific
amendment in front of us you
know I'm not privy to the
reasoning behind it you know
just like I'm not free the to
whatever projects you may have
asked council service as an
individual provided for to re
authorizing this bill all I have
in front of me is the you know
the text and so I'm not sure why
they would want to.
Change the use to allow them to
purchase and equip vehicles
instead of the original language
which which was to purchase
anything with a motor grader I'm
I'm just not sure what the
reason for that is because it
wasn't an application that I
made that I've the authorized
myself.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman
I I am someone interested in the
process by one by which one
could could make this type of
change because it may come up in
my district
and so what we're I need to do
as a legislator to.
If if the local government
entity tells me that they are no
longer need this type of
equipment or this type of
project but look would like to
convert it to another what do I
need to do as a legislator to
accomplish exactly what your
amendment does today with
respect to the road greater to
automobiles.
Yes madam spot Mr speaker and
gentleman my understanding is
state next year you know one of
the applications I made last
year for example say they need
more time to expended or say
they want to re purpose it for a
different
purpose I would go to council
service and I would ask that
particular application from
twenty twenty to this particular
agency or local government the
re authorized to be used for
this other purpose and then that
language would make it into that
next year's
re authorization bill.
So so Mister speaker and
gentleman so so this.
This is not unusual I I guess I
they have retained things that
they do this we're just seeing
this on amendment because this
was a maybe a late change it is
after would that be a correct
understanding.
Mr speaker and gentleman yeah I
mean that's probably what
happened it probably wasn't
wasn't a change you know
somebody probably didn't even
get it in on time and and so the
they
they they they made the
amendment.
Mr speaker and gentleman if
you're saying the month of
August I find out that one of my
capital outlay projects a couple
years ago is not proceeding like
they thought there may be a
process in place with with is it
DFA or what which which have to
do what I need to contact to
start the ball rolling to make
these changes are out reallocate
of the capital outlay money.
Mr speaker and and gentleman you
know for for your specific
legislator allocations in my
understanding is that you have
quite a bit of sway over it
right so if you know this.
You know your local government
seems to be needing the money
for another purpose you would go
to the council service and ask
for re authorization to to be up
to be done and then you know
you'd have to wait till the
legislative session so that this
body can approve it in the
governor can sign it but that's
probably the the most Baystate
constraint for way to get a re
authorization done.
And so Mister speaker and
gentlemen so it's Legislative
Council Service not DFA or some
other
Our state agency.
Yeah the the the technical
writing and the bill drafting is
you know is done for the council
service now it could be that DFA
you know working with you might
make the request on your behalf
right as the executive holder
and his first of the money
ultimately but yes we are able
to make the it's it's your
decision as the legislature to
pass work with council service
to draft the language for your
re authorization.
Mr speaker John thank you for
for that information that may
come in handy.
As I move forward with with the
some of my communities I'd like
to shift gears with respect to
the other amendment that you you
have and that is
The space for and and as you
know
Last term we created an ability
for all military bases to state
local approval to establish an
airport authority and so on I'm
I'm I'm kind of focused on that
I'm I've been interested in it
for some time and and we're
still in the process of going
through that project with this
amendment that you talked about
the spaceport I think hold some
intrigue for for me maybe some
of the nation's legislators a
that
deal with Travis county maybe
some of the other counties that
that could qualify for one of
those airport authorities and as
I understood the the amendment
that you're bringing forth for
the members of the Senate
brought forth I'm sorry is that
You could take capital outlay
money.
That was should be used for
capital projects and maybe come
Burke that to.
Appropriations of that entity is
that what I heard correctly Mr
speaker and gentleman.
Mr speaker and gentleman I don't
know the specifics of
you know how or why the request
was made.
but in the original bill the the
in those three different
sections the words project
manager were inserted in order
to allow for that appropriation
to be used for some of the
operating
purposes that the space for past
with the Senate finance
committee amendments.
It was
you know the it was
interrogative the committee that
they tied up the language
instead of using project manager
throughout those two different
sections that they just give and
up to dollar amount that the
spaceport can use for operating
purposes coming out of that
specific allocation which was as
we stated earlier about sixteen
million dollars I should also
note that that particular
application was in the capital
outlay for capital outlay but it
was out of the general fund so
you know we wouldn't be bonding
out one point seven five million
dollars for operating purposes
because the source is general
fund.
And so Mister speaker and
gentleman of that.
The.
Eight major a couple other
questions would this be the
first time that capital outlay
money would now be authorized to
put to use for operations which.
What's very definition is not
investing in capital there's no
tangible product when you put it
toward at appropriations that
money we want to spent there's
nothing left the there which
goes back to my original
definition of what I thought
capital outlay should be so is
this the first time that's
happened or is this following
prior president with respect to
other specific projects around
the state.
Mr speaker and gentleman
I don't I'm not sure if this has
ever happened before this is
only the first and second time
that I carry this bill and some
not previous to whether any
other project out of the
hundreds that we fund every year
has ever requested that funds be
be approved for operations
you know and so I I don't know
what the direct answers to that
but based on what the gentle
lady from the Jana and say that
was was telling us earlier you
know there are different
dynamics at play was space for
that I'm not personally preview
to I mean I I'm not I'm not as
informed on the project and the
dynamics is as as others but I I
do know that part of the reason
why the request came in from the
spaceport was because without
without operating support they
were having a hard time moving
some of these projects again you
know I don't know why that is I
don't know why there's not more
operating money from other
sources whether it's local or
state I'm not sure of those
dynamics but but you know to
answer your question has this
ever been done before I don't
know we we fund hundreds of
projects every year and we we
authorize hundreds of projects
of the year I'm not sure if it's
ever ever happens.
Mr speaker and gentleman thank
you for that answer.
Maybe all share my opinion here
here in a moment with you but I
I am kind of intrigued with with
the space for because it's my
understanding that there was
some time ago there was kind of
a.
maybe of people in the
organizational structure because
they were using certain monies
for operations and it just seems
odd to me that now we're using
capital outlay money for
operations in the same into the.
When the state took a pretty
good view of what was going on
previously with respective bond
money or G. R. T. money being
used for for operations and and
so I I just find that a bit
unusual
and and Mr speaker and gentleman
You I don't have a question
there's just kind of a.
Kind of strikes me as odd
Mr speaker and gentleman you ask
for my opinion but I'm going to
share it with the body anyway.
I really really am concerned if
we start using capital outlay
money for operations.
State agencies state entities
local governments
They ought to be using.
Other sources of revenue for
operations not capital outlay
money our communities are in
dire need of capital projects.
There's not a there's not a
quarter of the state that can
say it has all its capital needs
that.
Water infrastructure.
Whether the fresh water lines
fresh water storage sewer lines
as solid waste disposal of
liquid waste disposal rose
Upkeep on on the physical plants
the buildings that that we have
all those things are in need of
of attention around the state
and it really concerns me if we
start taking capital money money
that's to be used for capital
projects and start peeling off
some of that so that it goes
toward operations of an entity
no matter how well intentioned
no matter how needed that money
is.
Yet yet the tracks from what I
would consider the real purpose
of capital outlay and that is
providing for for needed
infrastructure for a period of
years hopefully for many years
and certainly years beyond that
which the bonding may may be up
that so with that Mr speaker and
gentleman
you now have my opinion on on
that issue I will support this
notwithstanding that concern but
it does bring to light an issue
that I think that we and maybe
your committee in the future if
these things get brought up I
would sure appreciate you and
your committee pushing back on
some of those efforts thank you
Mr speaker thank you gentlemen
for a.
The debate thank you all right
Representative money twice the
gentleman from San Juan if she's
in the building I'm calling the
next of not I've got the
gentleman from Dona Ana grant
and she got a Representative
USCIS.
Let's give me just a minute CVC.
John I go I have.
Representative losses go ahead
please.
Thank you Mr speaker.
With the German please yield.
I yield to the gentleman from
the United States.
Thank you Mr speaker gentleman
you know I learned a lot about
capital outlay and
The bunch about about re
authorization
and so you know the Legislative
Council services those little.
All those little
tutoriales if they give us
freshmen were forty ten so help
me understand a lot of what
we're supposed to do here and
and so one of the things that I
they did Mr speaker John is I
wanted to make sure that all the
projects that we had going on my
district because I was new to
this
I was made aware that they could
be of some of these projects are
due to be a re authorized and so
Legislative Council was very
very good with me and took the
time to search through the
projects and see that that they
would help me and so thankfully
there wasn't because of what one
of the things that was important
to me as I did want to make sure
that that you know.
The new I'm and that the
previous my predecessor probably
have some projects that that
could be in our district and I
do want to make sure that those
one derailed because I think
that's important to continue to
finish up things because
communities and municipalities
or whatever depend on those so
you know I'm sorry I was in the
chamber earlier to hear some of
space for stuff and so I just
wanted to tell you that space
for is in the same county that
that I Representative Mr speaker
gentleman but it's actually not
in my district but it's pretty
much right right next door in
but it's still very important
to.
Sierra County so Mr speaker and
gentleman I I I heard that
and that's one of the things
that one of the other
representative brought up I
didn't know
Wasn't aware how.
The money could be transferred
from that was it.
From from much was it from a the
pharmacy my little note here
infrastructure I guess two
operations that I understand
that right.
Mr speaker German this
allocation was for capital
outlay in twenty nineteen and
they are re authorize one point
seven five million dollars of
that purpose for operating
purposes.
Okay thank you Mr speaker German
so yeah I didn't I didn't know
so was that original realtor the
original project was it for for
some sort of capital Ieper this
is for a capital outlay project
do you happen to know what they
were building out there I I I I
I don't know much about it I'm
learning about space for.
Madam Mister speaker I don't
know the gentle lady earlier
from on the get instant admitted
to maybe as a visitor center I
think is what she said but I
don't.
Well Mister speaker gentleman I
think will I'm going to do more
of what I did
It right before session which
was learn about the projects in
my district because this is it's
so important to.
Literally go see the project I
mean there's a there's a
different from seeing a number
on a piece of paper and a
location on a piece of paper of
a project but until you walk in
actually tour the facility or
the whatever this is where the
money is necessary the project
what the the intent of the
project is.
It's it's difficult to to
understand that you know
understand what what what we are
talking about when you just see
it and and it's Mr speaker and
gentleman it's it's evident
right now that that
On a piece of paper it's hard to
know what was this all about and
so
The other thing I wanted to ask
is is a.
One we need to all I was kind of
a shame that I don't know where
that is Mr speaker gentleman.
You know where that is Mr
speaker German I'm speaking
gentlemen I do it significantly
County it's a it's a chapter the
Navajo Nation.
Mr speaker at the gentleman I
saw that the they made some
changes there I guess to to to
purchase some vehicles instead
of a was it a greater change
change a greater two vehicles
for whatever was left over from
the greater purchase vehicles.
Mr.
Speaker and gentleman the
allocation as we authorized the
purchase and equip.
Vehicles instead of producing a
good premium motor grader.
Thank you Mr speaker German I'm
sorry it's because we've been
here a long time and I've had
five operations on my eyes and I
was struggling see the blue in
the in the red
highlight on my computer I think
my eyes are getting tired so I
apologize for that Mr speaker
John well I appreciate all what
I've learned I've learned a lot
literally in this chamber in in
the last
two months and I appreciate
everyone how they've been
and and so it's it's it every
time I listen and I know that
sometimes Mr speaker gentle mask
a lot of questions but that's
how I learned so I appreciate
all of your patience and and
thank you so much I reeled.
Seeing no further debate the
gentleman to close.
Thank you Mr speaker members of
the body Mr speaker correctly I
state this wrong but I move that
the house concur with Senate
amendments to house taxation and
revenue committee substitute for
House Bill to ninety six.
We have a motion.
Two can Kerr with the Senate
amendments to house taxation and
revenue committee house bill.
Two ninety six as amended with
an emergency clause all those in
favor of the motion to concur
signify by saying all high I'm.
All those against nay.
The house has concurred with the
Senate amendments to house bill
two ninety six as amended with
the emergency clause.
I'm going to item number four is
the gentleman ready on how
strong resolution one.
Yes Mr speaker you can give me
again either.
this is concurrence so you would
make the motion for the house to
concur or in the Senate
amendment or amendments thank
you let me just take a moment to
explain the Senate amendments of
these amendments were made.
in the Senate finance committee.
And and they did several things
Mr speaker a members of the body
one is the only raise the
distribution for the comment
schools they did not raise the
distribution for the other
twenty one beneficiaries
secondly
they increase the distribution
from one to one point two five
however that's divided sixty
forty amongst early childhood K.
through twelve so it'll be point
seven five increase for early
childhood point five for K.
through twelve
And with that Mr speaker I move
that the body concur.
with the Senate amendments to
education house Education
Committee substitute for House
street resolution one.
There has been a motion there is
debate the gentleman from San
Juan Representative Strickler.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman from Bernalillo police
shield.
Mr speaker yes I yield thank you
thank you gentleman
We've it out.
I guess the the original bill is
one percent and and it was going
to go I guess a hundred percent
early childhood is that I was
going to work last time.
Mr speaker gentle of those on
one yes okay and there's no
there's no sunset is that right
gentleman Mr speaker gentleman
from San Juan no sunset leaving
the house or coming back from
the Senate of.
Okay thank you Mr thank you Mr
Mr speaker and and and gentleman
and what is it what is the what
is going to be the the draw down
on this at one point two five
per year
I know
we I think the last bill was
like a hundred million a year is
that riders a hundred fifty
million a year now that we've
upped the ante a little bit.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman because I want.
Because you know the the the
fund is now at twenty two
billion dollars.
But the drawdown is based on the
last five year average or six
year average when we get to the
next fiscal year.
So if if the one point two five
existed now.
Of.
It would be approximately eight
hundred ninety.
No that's incorrect because
they're only we're only taking
from the COVID schools it would
be approximately hundred seventy
million dollars annually to
increase along with the growth
of the fund.
So the hundred seventy million
dollars and it's going to be a
sixty forty split.
So to be about a hundred hundred
twenty million I mean I'm just
guessing you know ballpark
hundred twenty million for early
childhood and fifty million for
K. to twelfth something in that
ballpark your job from San Juan
so yeah in a couple of years
it'll be a hundred twenty
million for early childhood
eighty million for K. to twelfth
with a sixty forty split yes and
we left this money if it had we
left this this amount in for
example I maybe maybe to came up
with a creative way to go for
you know to fund these programs
to the general fund
Over ten year period how much
for the land grant permanent
fund grow if if if we decided
not to go this route you know we
got twenty two billion in there
now and you know if we left it
at five percent drawdown
I and I know the numbers are
pretty high so the EDD.
You're pretty good with your
memory banks on on this you care
this bill for seven years or
eight years have a long.
Thank you devided seven right
here state.
And the numbers keep getting
bigger each year.
What up some looking at the FIR
in page three the F. R. as it
came out of the house so in ten
years without the distribution
for early childhood and for K.
through twelve the fund would be
private three billion dollars
larger it be up V. thirty eight
billion instead of thirty five
billion.
Yeah that sounds about right I
know no we we
had a draw down it was a sunset
right the last time we did this
was in two thousand three.
And it was
Leave it was from four point
seven percent to
six point one percent is is that
about right gentleman the last
time we did this.
Thank you Mr speaker John from
San Juan well we've never done
early childhood but you're
correct that when we did the
last increase in distribution is
about a twelve year sunset.
One from four point seven to
five point eight and then down
to five point five for like
three years and then down to
five what it what it is today
and
good good good point there so
that twelve year experiment I
guess it wasn't we did lose
quite we lose a three billion
dollars to the press we lost
what about a
one half billion dollars Hey we
left it impact.
Mr speaker of German present I
don't know that sounds about
right to fund was significantly
smaller back in two thousand
three yeah we I think it was
around ten million dollars if
I'm not mistaken way back when
when you and I got here is that
right gentleman.
Mr speaker John but I think I
got to walk.
Ten million in two thousand nine
or just before the crash and
then a year after the two
thousand three I might have been
down to six or seven billion I'm
not I'm not positive okay so
really has grown this we wanted
today because only gas is a
depleting asset then we know the
volatility of oil and gas and
this is this is a bit of this is
a brilliant the land grant
permanent fund was absolutely
brilliant by our founders are
our predecessors to set this up
when they did
I mean we're that we like up
there with Alaska and Texas is
for Sir there are permanent
function I think we're like
third if I'm not mistaken is
that is that your understanding
gentleman.
Mr speaker John from San Juan I
think it's one of the largest of
its kind it's it's up there with
you know the harbor.
Fund which is existed for
centuries.
But I believe you're correct I
think it's in terms of state
funding I think it's only
smaller than Texas.
Yeah I think I think you're
right and gentleman I think it's
actually Alaska I think they've
got like a sixty billion dollar
trust fund and they they do that
you know I have fun you know
state government up there but
they also give each each Tax
each citizen a kind of a David
and if you will in Alaska in the
legislature up there they kind
of I don't how much that's going
to be each and every year
because that is our main revenue
source so it I mean they're
they're really way up there ask
them this the all you know
loyalty sin and and laces up on
the
on the north slope and then I
think Texas is probably number
two.
And they were numbers for a and
then we also gentleman we also
blessed to have the severance
tax permanent fund and that's
what that's about a five billion
dollar fund.
They will use that for capital
outlay in and all of our K. you
know a school school projects
our school capital outlay of
higher ed and so forth so
gentleman I know we we talked
about this in in the on the one
percent you know idea earlier in
the session and we were
commenting about the our budget
you know our regular General
probation and I believe this
year
R. appropriations for
Early childhood development is
is five hundred million dollars
this year and I know you you've
got some good numbers on that
is that about right just a
gentleman.
Mr speaker John from San Juan
dots of all right in in in in K.
through twelve we've increase at
funding to gosh the.
And I don't know that off the
top of my head but it's over
three point two billion
something like that for K.
through twelve.
So we're doing we're doing
pretty good with federal dollars
coming in and and
And so this is kind of hands as
to the as to the effort to
improve early childhood
development here from the K.
through twelve a bone to.
Mr speaker jumps on one of the
Senate felt compelled to.
To utilize the permanent fund
for an additional point five for
K. through twelve they actually
did what we stopped doing a
couple years ago and they
basically put us the enabling
some enabling language in there
Into the amendment so it is
earmarked it is earmarked within
the K. to twelve system
For enhanced instruction for
students of at risk of failure
extending the school year and
public school teacher
compensation so they put that
language in the resolution but
we but we've we've bumped up
education particularly the past
three years but we lost a lot Mr
speaker John from San Juan
during the.
The ten year you know Recession
of where we're spending did not
keep up with with inflation so
we're we're just getting back on
our feet.
On the from the banking crisis
of eight in my opinion.
Thank you gentlemen and yeah it
was a tough ten years there's no
doubt from G. we United it's for
is that revenue shortfall in two
thousand nine we really had to
come back here and we cut we cut
the budget dramatically we had
to raise taxes
you know to it was a combination
you know the budget cuts and
three I think was a three
hundred million dollar tax
increase back in two thousand
nineteen in to help help short
the budget and it was a pretty
hard pretty a miraculous
procedure because we had a six
point two billion dollar budget
and we had to cut seven hundred
million dollars and that was a
combination of cuts and and tax
increases and it just for money
you know our budget remained
flat are not flat but pretty
pretty flat.
For for many many years and and
then the pandemic hit last year
so that K. to send the tape
again cause us totally you know
on it unsuspected
you know the economy was going
going strong we're doing well in
two thousand nine it was a
housing bubble and the financial
crisis you know we're we're the
you know stock market correction
I mean everything just went
south and in it amazingly with
the pandemic last year you know
stock market crash thirty
percent but it read about it
maybe just and and that helped
all of our trust funds you know
our land grant permanent fund
are the earnings took a hit but
only for me however cover like
in six months so you know that
was really a blessing you know
for for finances that the you
know the the the all right of
return you know I think it's
just is it a seven percent
benchmark said our goal to
generate a seven percent rate of
return on the land grant
permanent fund gentleman Mr
speaker a general from San Juan
the S. I see a.
Projects like a seven percent
return.
but then every once up to eight
point five it's been greater
than that I mean the stock
market has just been blowing up
the past you know secure seven
years
What they projected between
seven and eight point five and
then of course over the over the
thirty year cycle is guaranteed
guaranteed to grow right around
that.
But I think there I thought I
think you're right on that I
think it's seven percent I I
believe that's our benchmark if
we you know we're going to go
above and beyond you know a pin
down but I think the the goal if
I'm not mistaken seven percent
or maybe maybe it's a little
higher so if it gets update have
that's gravy if you know if it
if it drops to five percentages
all bounces out much like our
our pricing for are for only gas
it's like forty six forty a
dollar forty seven dollars for
this coming fiscal year and and
that's a pretty conservative
number so we can you know count
on that
Women also we couldn't we can
treat you always.
Mexico alone the ten year
project is not you percent and
the thirty year projections
seven point eight.
I'm with the gentleman from
Bernalillo Representative
Maestas would you repeat that we
got some somebody was not needed
and so I don't think we heard
the results if you get out Mr
speaker John from San Juan so
I'm looking at the the.
At the state investment council
FIR and they have a.
The the five year projection is
eight point five the ten year is
seven point seven and the thirty
a projection of seven point
eight percent growth and that's
just financial growth that
doesn't include the inflows of
cash from the state land office
and on a monthly basis.
Thank you thank you gentlemen
and thank you Mr speaker thank
you gentleman bottom line that's
a very prudent you know bench
market seven percent gosh if if
if all of us can do seven
percent on our or appropriations
and you know so our self
employment.
fund that we've been good shape
so that's that's good news there
gentleman there is also a fund
set up I believe in twenty
nineteen or maybe twenty I think
twenty nineteen
the a new trust fund was set up
for the early childhood
development we we are we're
flush with cash with thirty five
percent cash reserves so the
legislature
Took out three hundred million
dollars to set up a trust fund
for early childhood development
can you give us a little status
of that image and how that helps
the three pronged approach to
fund early childhood development
you've got the general budget
dollars and now you have a trust
fund and then that and then you
have this this special mark so
can you you're pretty pretty
well versed on that three
hundred million dollars has at
work and how much money we get
each year for that.
Mr speaker John from San Juan
you're correct we put in three
hundred million dollars cash
into a trust fund first time in
his to this country estate had
done that instead of utilizing
the cash itself
so yeah we created this up for
each other trust fund the plan
was to fund it up to a billion
dollars in three years and then
get fifty million a year kind of
the same philosophy
as the up.
As the let represented fund so
that trust is still in place so
it's essentially three hundred
dollars earmarked for relief at
that's why of the election will
be until the fall of twenty
twenty two that wasn't that
sense of urgency we can use that
three are then air mark to help
build out starting now and then
the Senate actually wants to put
the.
Point seven five into the trust
to be the trust is obsolete now
that assuming the voters passed
this but but yeah we definitely
have a a cash flow for early
childhood where we can build out
that system responsibly as
quickly as humanly possible.
We're in a very good situation
Mr Mr speaker John from someone
thank you thank you Mr speaker
thank you gentlemen.
So you made a real good point
there the three hundred million
dollar trust fund was kind of a
stopgap.
To see whether or not we're
going to you know tap into the
land grant permanent fund and so
it you would think if they were
done and and that three hundred
million dollars the data if
there some spots of just putting
that into the land grant
permanent fund account shorted
up since you got a sense if this
thing passes through you know
through this chamber and and for
the voters would that be the
next step you have three million
dollars and it's got this and I
just want to have that you may
not need it.
Mr speaker John from someone
that that is by proposal that is
going to be my proposal in a
couple years that's one to is is
obsolete we we now in also in
the orders passed this so we
could take that cash and.
And just you know it can
continue to invest in your spend
that you know as as we need to
or put that cash into the
permanent fund or at least keep
the accounting similar
I think the Senate wants to take
money from the land grant
permanent fund and put it into
that trust that makes no sense
to me soul will we'll struggle
that out with our friends in the
Senate hopefully in a couple
years.
Yeah I think we need to be Mr
speaker Jim I think we need to
be careful that that that's a
little bit I think that's a
bridge too far yes I do you know
take up more money out of
trouble this is this is my
current concern that I have and
and you have yeah we divide this
for many you know many years
you know only gases Walters you
know gentleman and it's up and
down we have many buttons we
have many bus.
We're you know last year was a
was a another kind of a short
term but just because of the
pandemic and the the economy
collapsing.
Honest no fault of our own and
unemployment shot up and and
then all and then the demand for
oil and gas went down and then
the Saudi Arabia.
Russian price for issues it was
a double whammy whammy for our
budget I know my little company
experienced a forty seven
percent decline in revenues
thirty two percent was because
of Christ price fall and then
the rest just normal recline of
the announcements are made a you
know a gas is a kind of a the
treadmill the you got to
continually drill wells and
complete Welser and hooked them
up to the pipeline.
Because your production drops
off so quickly and so are you
worried about the volatility of
of all the guests I know there's
there were some comments and one
of my committees at all and gas
is going to be gone five or ten
years which I think is
absolutely wrong and I think
that's requests they're not you
know not feasible are going gas
number here state whether we
whether we can summon here
locally or exported so.
What what are your concerns or
you have concerns about the you
know the volatility of the oil
and gas industry and the and the
health this are you know this
precious land grant permanent
fund what are your thoughts
there gentleman Mr speaker John
from San Juan I actually don't I
actually don't of for the
following reasons is projected
to grow over the next thirty
years seven point eight percent.
Right now you know as long as it
consistently grows our
distribution is about a point
lower four point nine percent
lower than I our last
distribution as you recall on
February first was a three point
eight seven percent which is the
the current five year rolling
average so so that's all the
money that comes in from the
state land office it's just it's
greatly is great it's on top of
the seven point eight in terms
of financial investment so the
fund is grown thirteen percent
one year eleven percent one year
you know thirteen percent the
other the we're still below
generational equity I think as
you mentioned during the budget
crunch of you know fourteen
fifteen sixteen align our
permanent fund distribution was
growing to fifty sixty seventy
million dollars and we and we
that sixty seven then saved us
and so we got so used to it
saving us that we that we
enjoyed it that money and we
lost sight of how best to invest
that money
so that by bumping it to six
point two five the distribution
in real time will be right
around that four point nine five
percent that that we think it's
it's prudent but the fund is
still gonna exceed inflation and
the growth of the fund is still
gonna exceed the distribution
over the next twenty years
But but my point is as a the
volatility of of the crude oil
industry.
Doesn't matter as long as we
keep our our reserves above
twenty percent as we keep our
reserves about twenty percent I
I think we're good as long as
the fund grows from financial
noted vestments above seven five
were good and everything else is
just on on top of that is just
icing on the cake.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentleman
it invests basket information
because you know I've been the
only gases and forty four years
I know it's up and downs it's a
base requirement top industry
but you can't prepare for that
and that's what's that's what's
so remarkable of this land grant
permanent fund is disposal
widely you know the the highs
and lows of the of the industry
you know the production and the
pricing and so forth and and
course you know only gases or
worldwide commodity and there's
there's plenty of demand for
overseas within arms you with
general great country and you
know overseas you know China
Japan a separate any other that
that there are great native
natural gas leak you know we got
a market international market
for that which we did before
other than just pipelines to
Canada or Mexico now we can
liquefied in shepherd and and
that production all wheel is
going up and up and so I'm I'm
really bullish on natural gas
and and we don't talk about that
much your and and all is going
to do is go up and down maybe it
just depends on the world to
manage support but gentleman you
know when you you mentioned the
big trust funds it you know
Harvard University Stanford
University University Texas all
big thank you to our seats have
a big plus months in your in
your property I mean I they're
they're more major forty fifty
billion dollars so maybe they
are locked the last year or so
strong and and they're they're
destined visors geminate they
can choose four percent you know
drawdown is is the most prudence
you know scenario
plan back to those institutions
are to the state we're not and
that four percent seems to be
the magic mark and we're gonna
go above there is that does that
bother you any
I mean obviously we have a four
percent drop down your your your
your funds going to grow and
just like the simple and you
know twelve year examples of
your you know that you we
summarize forced number four
point seven five point eight
whatever laws after twelve years
in place background of five
percent
my understanding is that one
half million dollars of the loss
of the principal would have
generated a hundred million
dollars in extra cash for and so
what you're asking now is a
hundred seventy eight hundred
seventy million dollars all day
on with this additional one
point two five and had it it
would just hypothetically if we
left the money in there that you
know the revenues are going to
come up and and we've got it
covered I mean we're gonna have
an additional influx of you know
hundred fifty hundred seven
million dollars so why would why
we don't.
Thank you Mr speaker John from
someone no I I agree with that I
agree with that analysis when
you're strictly looking at the
fund and you're strictly looking
at the.
At the the growth of the fund as
it relates to contributing to
the general fund each year it's
it's been incredibly helpful
over this ten year recession.
A quick points one is the the
Harvard fund doesn't have a oil
and gas royalties is strictly
financial growth and that's why
they want to keep it for number
two Harvard Harvard students for
the most part don't have
generations of poverty and
despair and.
And that you know just a lot of
trouble social issues like our
children do in the state
and then and then lastly it's
it's a question of investing and
whether that that.
That loss to the fund will be
recouped in terms of.
Our tax dollars and and that's
where the answer will be yes so
say in twenty years we're gonna
miss out on
You know fifty more dollars in
tax dollars because the the
distribution.
What is less or whatever thirty
years down the road for years on
the road the question is when
that generation develops with
that generation rate.
Cover that that that.
Cover that loss in in tax
revenue the answer's yes the
answer is yes
I mean if our economy grew five
percent for the next five six
years it would be quite to the
eight hundred thirty six million
that the land grant permanent
fund is currently giving us for
this fiscal year.
so it's just a question of
seizing the future growing our
economy having the confidence
that our young people stay here
when they graduate high school
and college have higher lifetime
earned income pay more taxes
have less a strain on the on the
governmental.
Programs in terms of the social
cost of poverty and things that
nature so so we'll we'll keep
our in our eye on this fund but
we can just look at the fund
Justin in terms of the numbers
we have to look at and our
society in our economy as a
whole which I believe will grow
as a result of this resolution.
Thank you for the uninsured Mr
gentleman from Bernalillo and
and Mr speaker I'm University
Texas are a graduate one night
in and they have a you know they
they have a lot of inflection
here their permission on yes
dollars and and I they have a
donor pool and that's not tax
revenue or national and gas
revenue which is similar revenue
string that they they they
constantly say contributions are
J. Shearer have a good handful
of into the into their a trust
fund and then of course you can
appropriations same waist not
coming from all the gas like
ours you know like our fund is
is coming from generous donors
from around are done well
they've you know they've got a
good degree they've been able to
you know start a business and
and we have a you know you every
every university has some great
job donors and
you know for example Oklahoma
state university that got but
patients and loan actually
donate you know three four
million dollars you know to the
university and so forth and and
so I understand that I made but
I think again we need to kind of
focus on on a lot of trust funds
for know what land grant
permanent fund is for initiative
to have steady growth and and
our state rate of return shuttle
bay here you know I'm fifty
years more grandkids or
graduated from college you know
we we're looking at had and and
I know we have immediate needs
now gentleman in Mr speaker in
and I know we spent quite a bit
on education here in Mexico I
think we're gonna miss and Dan
you have you have all these
numbers on on top of your head I
think we're twenty fifth out of
fifty states are spending person
is is our twelve thousand a year
and I think just twenty fifth in
the nation is is that your
understanding or right in the
middle.
Of spending per people in our
state does that sound right here
are or maybe you can look that
up.
Mr speaker John from someone I
don't have that in front of you
but I I think it's about right I
mean it's not equal to the
output to right and that's
that's concerns a lot of folks
but we have to consider the
rural nature of our state the
sixty eight school districts all
these tiny school houses all
over the state
the rise of charter schools
there for a while so it's it's
more expensive just just on that
point but the key is the output
the key is the output and that's
where the you got a kind of
listen to the concerns of the
Yazzie plaintiffs in that is not
the input is the output and I
think that if we
if we just take leaps forward in
terms of how do we educate at
risk youth limited English
speaking use our our native use
that's the key you know that's
the key and not and I think
hopefully we'll have the
resources to implement those
programs but it's the programs
themselves and the and the way
to teach New Mexicans that'll
that'll pay out the most.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
thank you gentleman twenty eight
again your striker of the you
brought up a good point I mean
we're we are I think we are in
the mid range for all of it I
think we're in the twenty five
twenty fifth.
first in the spending but our
results of that last of Sutton's
some got to be I mean we've got
to get better results when I get
you know when I talk to you know
parents in my district you know
formed schools are are quite
good I mean we we've got a we've
got a good snowboard we we've
got a you know a great job
superintendent and and the
results have really been good I
think right number one state for
more excuse for and and
relations number two so we're
you know real product in our
area and actually I think I
think they're kind of a good
exception and I think the other
school districts need to counter
figure out what their down line
wrong and you know our
graduation rates are
you know like eighty percent you
know why above the average in
our state and yeah we're real
proud of the but this pandemic
really not distant Tate and for
students are walking right now
because of the pandemic and and
the online one of the autism
learning online learning is just
not it's just not working at and
I I don't think we're long you
know it's real it's real it's
real concern that we have and in
Farmington yeah I know they're
trying to address that we're
going we're saying the students
were have a lot of home visits
I have a I have a lot of
requests are school teachers and
principals vice principals and
and and and I love it you know a
lot of these people right now
get out of the school teachers I
mean they they they really put
their heart online and these
kids are really struggling so
now that we're opening up and we
were gonna have a chance that we
all you know what yeah I think
we're going to keep I think
we're going to recover you know
share than lighter but
You know the I think the
majority you know the main
concern that I have with this is
we're not getting our money's
worth and there's no reason
program in June this year I mean
my district is so it it's it's
very diverse we have a third
Navajo's thirty Spanish and
Burbank law I mean you can't get
any better than that I mean
we're good you know we're
getting yes as and we're done
you know we're doing pretty darn
good and you know we got four
people we I mean we got middle
class people you know we lost a
lot of you know a lot of
population are here because of
the you know the the volatility
only gas industry but that you
know the call industries and
power plants and so forth those
are natural big industrial waste
and you know we've lost a lot of
good people so next you know.
No rest for the weary up there
but but yet our schools are
doing pretty good and and so we
think we're getting our money's
worth up there with the state on
whole you know we're not and I
don't know this lack of
competition you know lack of
choice.
you know we've got to give our
or our parents to
you know the tools to go with
the best tools in our what
whatever text their kids are
getting that you know their
needs are getting met
and what's really which really
bothersome is that one schools
are closed you know it just
upsets the the mom and dad you
know grantors guardians on
behalf you know how they can
adjust their schedule to home
school their kids along with you
know along with the with the
instructor you know it takes a
lot more working so or so
Do you have any comments on on
on on school reform that by give
us bigger bang for the Buck you
know to make sure that our
investments we're getting a good
return on investment and
resources are Mr speaker and
gentleman yeah we're business I
mean we go out of this you know
which I gave a monopoly and I
mean there's no restore schools
is private schools and home
schools operators choices out
there but primarily our kids are
going to public schools in our
our student populations going
damn you know we're looking at
we're just once demographics
you know millennials are have
kids so you know we and I've got
I've got a bunch of millennials
you know I want to have kids we
got seven grandkids we're we're
we're about seven behind
schedule so you know that's
that's for future you know we
want you know what these kids
through our that you know what
actions we don't have a huge so
what we did is I mean.
to to have more cannot building
have more results and we were
you sent to the wrong money at
it and and we're not getting
very far.
Mr speaker John from San Juan no
I share the same concerns
obviously more money by more
things have more resources you
can pay people more things of
that nature there's so there's
no question that that that money
helps but you're right it's the
output is the output and what
folks don't talk about and what
what is not in the FY ours or
hasn't been.
Is the economic just a pure
economic impact of this
investment as you mentioned kids
are at home zooming parents have
to stay home when a child has
access to day care early
childhood educational programs
during the day then the moms can
go to work the moms can go to
community college get a degree
get a masters what not so just
the the ability for parents to
go to work or school and not be
at home all day long with the
with a toddler a two year old I
think it's going to benefit our
economy in and of itself and
then of course with the with the
health and wellness of the child
over the course of that child's
life but yeah you're right it's
it's crunch time the decisions
we make over the next five years
are going to be key it's what we
teach our students their house
bill one sixty three is on the
Senate floor I don't know if
it's going to get a hearing
mandating financial literacy
classes for all high schools and
so and and chairman Romero has a
fantastic you know what
revolutionary rewrite of the of
the of what's required in high
school we've never done that in
our years since we got in
debating what we teach we're
always debating the costs and
things of that nature so yeah we
got to figure out how to teach
New Mexicans to succeed in the
modern world how we fit in and
and and in terms of history and
time but I think we're we're at
that point I think the
leadership teams in the perfect
spot Senator up Representative
Lundstrom Semenya's the
secretary of early and we got
some great leaders in key seats.
and I think the time is now so I
if the voters do approve this
then the money will be well
spent given our checks and and
projects in our measurements
with regards to whether the
programs work or not but
definitely a more resources
helps and and this will this
will provide up upwards of you
know two billion dollars a
resources per decade without
raising a dime in taxes.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
thank you thank you gentlemen
you know I I.
You know it's it's not ever
state's different and and course
you know we're you know we're
we're you date and aren't you
know you look at your our
surrounding states and they
spent they spend less money on
education our results I think
Colorado is probably the the
the leader in terms of academic
performance and you know I I
have a different you know Kanye
and I have a large population
and so you know that they seem
to be down well Utah spends the
least amount for state and yet
they the results are are you
know ten ten places above their
spending level so
you know our goal if we're going
to spend twenty four twenty
fifteen spending percent we
should at least be twenty three
at the results I mean that's
that's the least that that's the
least we can ask of of of the
performance goals the outcomes
if you're referring J. and I
just don't know how to get there
I mean we you know you're not
been here the same fifteen years
you know losses two thousand
seven and we keep all right our
head against the wall every year
on on outcomes and and we're
just you know we're just not
getting there at how these
actual dollars I mean you know
we've got beautiful facilities
you know we got beautiful
schools now I mean you know
because of our capital outlay
program.
school capital outlay or or
facilities are top notch you've
got Beijing dollars in these
facilities.
And that's great but you know
with the class form I mean you
know our kids are struggling and
you know our teachers I have a
hard time you know getting you
know getting getting the the
academic performance.
You know what do you think you
think the secretary money's
gonna make that big difference.
Mr speaker John from someone
yes.
Thank you thank you Mr
Speaker and gentleman I always
enjoy my conversation with the
are on the house for you're
you're you're quite the
gentleman your encyclopedia of
information you're my sports
commentator your mob basketball
buddies and depreciate are your
ranchers and are you much a.
is further debate the gentleman
from San Juan Representative
lane.
Thank you Mr speaker to the
gentleman from Bernalillo yield.
Mr speaker I yield to the
gentleman from San Juan.
Mr speaker thank you for joining
Gen one from Bernalillo in.
As I was sitting here you know
reflecting on the minutes to the
Senate maybe I do want to say at
the outset that I.
I appreciate the the.
Momentum over the years the fact
that we're having this
discussion on the floor today I
think it's a healthy one for
taxpayers to be aware of I think
it's good for us to to highlight
in in for our citizens to
understand.
how many dollars are we in fact
allocated to each student how
many dollars are going to our
schools.
should those allocations the
change which I think is part of
what the Senate does is it
refocuses some of these dollars
from this this particular fund.
So I think it's a it's a healthy
and a good conversation on I'm
grateful that we're able to have
it the first question I have on
the equipment is is just a under
G. largely question about
nomenclature hung so I noticed
that that Rep bill we change
from Fund tell land grant
permanent fund to give you a
little insight on that Mr
speaker gentleman from
Bernalillo.
Thank you Mr speaker John from
San Juan no great great yes
great catch
No one no one spoke about that
in committee or on the Senate
floor some I'm glad you brought
it to our attention what the
Senate did is they chose we were
pushing one percent for all
beneficiaries.
we're pushing one percent up we
think it's fair we think it's
easy to manage and and some of
these beneficiaries could use up
an extra bump.
The biggest building New Mexico
military institute and the
school for the deaf.
What the Senate did Mr speaker
and gentleman from San Juan is
they only gave a one percent I'm
sure that a one point two one
point two five percent increase
for the common school portion of
the distributions all the the
twenty one other beneficiaries
do not receive
increasing distribution so the
way they did that in the in the
language of the of the
constitution is a create two
definitions of the frontier of
the land grant permanent fund
and then the permanent school
fund which is in statute which
is the fund that that allocates
to the COVID schools are the K.
to twelve so that's the reason
for that change so it does talk
about the like our permanent
fund but it and then it does
talk about the permanent school
fund
and makes a legal distinction
between the two.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo thank you for that
clarification and when you talk
about those two different funds
the way I understand the source
of the land grant permanent fund
and and I know you're correct me
if I'm off on this but and and
I'm I'm really just learn about
these things in the last six
days on I'm I'm probably not
perfect on it with the way I
understand the way that the land
grant permanent fund is funded.
Is whenever extracted into
industries extracting minerals
from public lands.
A percentage of those is paid to
the state and then those are
stored in this land grant
permanent fund is that correct.
Mr speaker John from San Juan
today its extractive industries
today back in the day it was
timber grazing things of that
nature so any money derived from
the management of the state
funds goes into the land grant
permanent fund but today it's
crude oil drilling so
so the for the money that goes
into the fund as wisely invested
New Mexicans have made
tremendous decisions over the
years we should all be proud in
the late fifties we created the
state investment council in the
I think the late sixties we
change the constitution to allow
investments and and the stock
exchange which airs on only did
about maybe fifteen twenty years
ago so we're way ahead of the
game.
and then in two thousand
fourteen we change the
constitution again to to lift
the fifteen percent cap on on
foreign investment which allowed
us to I think that's one of the
reasons is going so fast is is
we did that constitutional
amendment two thousand fourteen
so the people of New Mexico has
been made wise wise decisions
with regards to the land grant
permanent fund and that's why
it's grown so so robustly
Over the years.
Mr speaker gentle from
Bernalillo thank you for that.
It's not germane so I want to
ask you but you did to my
curiosity about why the policy
decision was made to remove.
Us likes December and some of
those other so maybe all go on
an internet search leader after
the meeting.
Thank you Mr chair for someone
at at that wasn't in the
constitution I just that's just
reality I mean now it's the land
is the best the best way to make
money off of the land is too
crude oil drilling as opposed to
selling timber a hundred years
ago so wasn't a legal changes
just change in the market.
Mr speaker John from Bernalillo
thank you need pro just save an
hour just got on the internet
unfortunately so thank you for
that
so.
There's another there's a second
one you mentioned what did you
call the permanent school fund
as of the second one is.
Mr speaker Joe from San Juan
yes.
And Mister speaker gentleman
from Bernalillo
so we talk about how the land
grant permanent fund is funded
how was the permanent school
fund funded.
Mr speaker job of someone the
exact same way the exact same
way so as the gentle lady from
Chavis was talking earlier today
various sections of land were
allocated to state government
those sections of land are
actually allocated to a
particular beneficiary.
it's really archaic and we need
to modernize this at some point
in the next decade or two but
each each section of land is
allocated to U. N. M. New Mexico
meditation highlands of the
state penitentiary or the common
schools eighty six percent of
the money currently in the fund
is earmarked for the common
schools so
So it's it's the it's the eighty
six percent of the land grant
permanent fund that is going to
get a one point two five percent
increase distribution with point
you know point seven five going
strictly for early educational
programs kids zero to five.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo and when we talk
about the the common schools is
not defined in the constitution
or is there some case law it is
that.
What what we generally I guess.
Commonly referred to as like the
K. to twelve public system or is
it going on.
Mr speaker John from someone in
my opinion it goes beyond that
but but in the in the Ferguson
Act which was the congressional
acted and anticipation of of us
becoming a state it uses the
word common schools in the two
thousand no I'm sorry in the
nineteen ten enabling act.
It uses the term common schools
and so common schools is what is
is the term we use
However you and I know what is
the public schools as the public
schools and then now is a
appropriators we know what is
the K. to twelve system managed
by by the public education
department so but the COVID
schools but what's great is.
The money has to go to a
particular beneficiary of per
our contract with the US
government the US government
will steal students back in the
seventies when we took money
from the minors hospital and
gave it to hospitals all over
the state for minors the the the
court said no you can't do that
has to go to the institutional
beneficiary however with the
common schools there is no
institutional beneficiary it is
the COVID schools in the
Ferguson Act enabling act spell
at point blank that the
territory shall have exclusive
control exclusive control over
the common schools so the common
schools as whatever we make of
it for example in the early
seventies we invented
kindergarten I think maybe a
hundred years ago invented high
school you know I think schools
was like.
One two six seven one two eight
and then one to twelve now it's
K. to twelfth and now you know
we invented you know in the last
twenty years but the last eight
eight years is essentially
invented invested invented
rather early childhood
educational programs
administered by the state and so
in my opinion that's part of the
COVID schools
it's if if if we knew then what
we know now about early
childhood I think the common
schools would have included
early childhood components back
in two thousand are back in
nineteen ten.
but none the less
The you know legal minds can
disagree
the.
The opinion of the Senate is
that it creates a new
beneficiary that the early
childhood of.
Purpose is a new beneficiary but
it will share the
it'll share the finances of that
common school component of the
land grant permanent fund.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo so I I I I guess I
would kind of implied from our
conversation is is that's why we
have that language and on on and
added on the very end of the
bill section three.
We're essentially what what that
section saying is is we have to
get we've of Congress to be able
to do this.
and so when we talk about like
adding center garden for example
the reference that you gave.
you know I I remember the the
first time it learned of my
parents and go to kindergarten
of strange thing that this is
assumed that the government
always existed but it but it
hasn't as you reference that
something that that it was a new
approach to education and now
it's been universally accepted
as far as I know
so did the state have to go to
Congress back then data center
gardens funding out of this
fund.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
San Juan it did not nor did
anybody care.
In the U. S. attorney or the.
The US attorney of the United
States or the US attorney in the
district of New Mexico everyone
thought that that was totally
appropriate.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo so I I gather then
the the natural extension from
that as well if if.
If we can go from first grade to
kindergarten.
Without legal Congress in in why
can't we also include three four
five year olds and in some form
of a appreciate public
education's going without having
to leave of Congress is that
right.
Mr speaker John from someone
that's correct that's correct
but that that a.
That was a minority opinion in
the Senate and the Senate felt
compelled to emphasize the need
to go to Congress
and so they've actually put it
in the act of which I think is
corny for the record but it's in
the act it just reminds us that
the forty percent going to K. to
twelve that's we don't need
congressional approval but the
up the sixty percent of the
point seven percent increase for
early add
we need the consent of Congress
to press I see to allocate those
funds and for us to appropriate
those funds per.
For the legislation.
Mr speaker gentleman from.
We are when we had.
Touched on earlier about the
Ferguson Act and I I think you
read reference was at twenty one
budget for is that the number
that you use.
Thank you Mr speaker John from
from San Juan yeah there's
twenty one beneficiaries of one
beneficiary kind has three
components so that's why of say
twenty one or twenty two.
But it's a twenty one
beneficiaries including the the
minors hospital in red tone.
there's one beneficiary that's
charitable penal and reform
which money goes to CYFD and
the.
And the detention center that it
that it manages Carrie Tingley
hospital there's a public
buildings component but for the
most part it's our colleges and
universities and the common
schools.
Mr speaker gentleman from
Bernalillo thank you for that
clarification I'm I'm gonna
expose my ignorance which I've
probably done many times already
in the sixty days but is there
any requirements when you talk
about across those twenty one
and fisheries.
These monies have to be divvied
out equally do we even have to
give anything to a single
beneficiary are there any rules
along
percentages across the budget
serves Mr speaker John from San
Juan up it depends on the tracks
of land that the that are
attached to the beneficiary
So now with horizontal drilling
you know with one institution
has a track a landing is able
you mind drawing on on my square
but yeah it's just contingent
upon the track of land in which
the money is is derived from
that is that earmarked for that
institutional benefit share.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo so I probably a a
tighter where more concise
waited I just asked the question
about ideas and wondering about
there there shouldn't be any
crosses concerns with
increasing the amount that's
being paid out of the corpus to
only a couple of your marketing
fisheries and not adding for
anyone else is that right thank
you madam speaker Johnson's on
on correct correct the
the point seven five allocation
for early add would would be a
percentage of the COVID schools
fund or the permanent permanent
school fund rather of that goes
to the COVID schools so yeah we
don't have to reallocate tracts
of land we don't have to we're
not giving early add point seven
five.
Tracts of land we're we're the
money that's derived from the
from the common schools land
will be defeated out per
percentage that's will be going
to Congress to to seek approval
for but in terms of the under
other beneficiaries it is not to
the detriment of of the other
beneficiaries at all for example
our special schools New Mexico
military institute.
A school for the deaf and school
for the blind.
What maintain their tracks of
land and maintain their money in
the in the permanent fund.
Mr speaker gentleman from
Bernalillo thank you for that
clarification on whether any
hospitals around that I do want
to focus next on paragraph G. as
in requests for and I noticed
there were some there is a
couple of different number
changes the first one I want to
inquire about.
Is the change from ten million
to seventeen billion.
And all of the of the German
just a second term to that that
particular program G. okay we're
good thank you
so can you talk about
why the change from ten to
seventeen and what the
significance is of all agree
that seventeen billion.
Mr speaker John from San Juan so
correct in this
the Senate amendments also
increase the.
The safety valve so to speak of
the fund from ten billion
dollars to seventeen billion
dollars the two thousand
fourteen constitution amendment
up increase it from five point
eight billion to ten and now
we're we're for the voters would
increase it from ten billion to
seventeen billion add frankly
it's just a feel good measure of
the fund is not gonna get below
seventeen billion but if it were
to dip below seventeen billion
over the course of five year
rolling average than the than
the one point two five
additional distribution would
cease so it's kind of like a
will increase at one point two
five but that's just make sure
that the fund stay solvent I
like the ten billion because
that guarantees half a billion
dollars in a.
Allocated to the general fund
but it but each but now it'll be
seventeen billion so it'll be a
guarantee.
Of.
Approximately eight hundred
fifty million dollars into the
general fund in perpetuity.
Mr speaker John from Bernalillo
so if I if I'm following you if
we look at the the average over
the last five calendar years.
If that average ever falls well
seventeen billion we can't top
this project additional one
point two five percent as of
right Mr speaker Jennifer's on
one correct.
And Mr speaker Jonathan Burley
what obviously I didn't attend
the the Senate committees with
you or the debate on the Senate
floor what was just what was the
discussion around increasing ten
to seventeen because ten billion
seems like a pretty large dollar
now to me and then but we
increases the seventeen billion
and so what what was the
discussion of the rationale for
that includes.
Mr speaker John from San Juan it
was touched on briefly and
Senate finance it was not
discussed on the Senate floor
I was not privy to those
conversations amongst the
sensitive finance members but I
believe it's because the five
year rolling average just
exceeded seventeen billion.
and that's probably why the
seventeen billion was chosen.
And Mr speaker John from
Bernalillo so
When we say it just exceeded
seventeen billion do we know
like if we look at that five
year rolling average looking at
it now and twenty twenty one
what is that average.
Mr speaker John from someone so
the average of the current
fiscal year is sixteen point
seven.
So that for fifty that that.
Got a point six years ago was
about fourteen billion and now
the new data point is twenty one
point six billion so
So I think it's somewhere
between seventeen and eighteen
billion is the could the five
year rolling average that we're
gonna go into the fiscal year
beginning July first but I don't
I don't know the math of hand.
And Mister speaker John from
Bernalillo when you say twenty
six for I'm sorry twenty one
point six billion are you saying
that's that's the balance of the
fund in twenty twenty one and
then when you average that out
over the last five years you
gets roughly around.
eighteen billion is that was
that I understand correctly Mr
speaker John from San Juan I
believe so the fund on December
thirty first twenty twenty was a
twenty one point six billion
dollars so that's the new.
Of variable in the five year
rolling average so we replace
the variable from six years ago
with the variable from December
thirty first average it out
devided by five percent and
that's the distribution into the
general fund for the next fiscal
year so you're correct it is a
it is between US seventeen in
an eighteen billion dollars.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo actually this is
actually quite helpful to to
know what that rolling I've just
been what is now and it puts
into context I think this is a
pretty big job from ten billion.
To seventeen billion.
And you know a lot of so we
don't have time the Florida to
play around with the math but I
would I would teachers and no.
If if the market you know god
forbid goes into a bear type
scenario over the next year to
how bad of a bear to have to
actually be to dip below
seventeen billion.
but this for another time maybe
some some late night nerd
session but I guess
but I do I guess I do find some
comfort knowing the seventeen
billion knowing that this is a
cell number that we reach say
thirty years ago but this is a
more recent number and so I
appreciate the clarification on
that.
And the other number I wanted to
focus in on this paragraph G. so
we talked about sort of.
That threshold for you can tapi
additional one point two five
percent but I do want to make
sure the members know when this
bill what the house it was one
percent correct.
Mr speaker John from San Juan
correct.
And and now the what the Senate
did was they they raise an
additional quarter point so now
we're talking about one point
two five percent and I
understand that we we change to
who gets that one point two five
health give it up but at the end
of the day the the corpus is
increased from one to one point
two five percent is that
correct.
Mr speaker John from someone the
distribution correct.
The Mr speaker and gentleman
from Bernalillo us I guess this
is the sponsor of the bill the
amendment the man who has
spearheaded this.
Movement for some time I would
just yes I'm deciding how to
vote on this these changes I I
actually would appreciate
concern your insight about this
change from one to one to one
point two five percent do you
think by adding in.
Some other beneficiaries and how
we're giving this up is this
breast at all.
The voters voting this down was
executive more reason about this
down so I I honestly would just
be curious to hear your thoughts
as someone whose bill was
changed by the Senate and how
you feel about these changes.
Mr speaker I don't know someone
thanks for the question you know
we're grateful to the Senate
grateful to the the chair Senate
finance and leadership on that
committee I think even though
they bump that to one point two
five I think so that may be more
difficult for folks to in this
chamber to deal with it does
have more conservative measures.
It is essentially has enabling
type language in the K. to
twelve component it lowers the
the distribution for early
education which is a system
that's that's yet to be fully
built out it and it adds the
consent to Congress component
which which a lot of people are
feel very strongly about.
And and the polling with the
marketing and the messaging and
the polling that we've been
doing the past four years as one
percent pretty education with
that's what we're doing it on
the campaign trail that's we've
been telling the population
that's what people have become
comfortable with
and that's what people are would
have voted for seventy five
percent so with the K. to twelve
component
you know people are as beloved
toward the K. to twelve.
system today as they were maybe
a year ago but I think people
understand that.
You know care K. through twelve
system our educational system is
the only thing that's going up
is going to move us move us
forward as new Mexican so I
think that people will
The people of Mexico made smart
decisions with the worst of this
fund for the past ten years and
I think they'll realize that
this is a smart move as well so
I think instead of a.
So it'll it'll it's the polling
is private hover around seventy
percent the campaign is not in
the bag it's going to be
eighteen months from now we
don't know what the situation is
going to be politically eighteen
months for now.
And the only real reason to
torpedo it is with massive
misinformation so regardless of
whether you supported supported
or not we got to be diligent to
to stick to the facts that that
we don't take five percent of
the fund would take five percent
of a.
Five year rolling average that
the fund does not just go
through financial investments
but financial investments and
royalties from the State Land
Office and that at a five point
eight percent distribution back
in a way to survive the greatest
banking crisis of our lifetime
and continue to grow massively
during the the worst a oil price
crash in our generation so
there's been these huge shocks
to the economy huge shocks to
our psychology as appropriators
that we need to overcome it's a
new day
the the banking crisis in a way
is a once in a lifetime deal the
oil price crash in two thousand
sixteen is a once in a
generation deal and we have to
rid ourselves psychologically of
those two historic moments and
move forward knowing that our
economy is about to to grow
significantly and that and the
crew of of business in New
Mexico the past three years is
the is the greatest three years
in the history of the state I
don't believe it's going
anywhere soon.
Mr speaker to come from
Bernalillo I I appreciate your
honesty and.
Insurance some insight and
I hope you're right that that
was just the one generation oil
bust I hope we never see that
again
I hope we never see the downturn
that we did seeing those seven
await climate.
and I I think that highlights to
the just the power of of
compound interest when you have
such a substantial.
corporate subjects such a
substantial principle that even
if it's just gains so two or
three percent as opposed to like
a running average and state
seven rate percent still a
pretty substantial amount when
you're talking about safe
fifteen billion twenty billion
two three four percent it is
massive.
and so but I do wonder you know.
When we talk about.
Not just want to get so this
house the work's not done as you
said we still have to find
information to voters let and
make an educated decision.
And I do appreciate them since
on not spreading misinformation
that doesn't do anyone any
favors to to to see people on so
I hope to hope that doesn't
occur.
But through this process and I I
I'd like to think things in
terms of risks and so I just
wonder when you add in as part
of the beneficiaries.
What the Senate is they they
said okay sixty percent is going
to early childhood.
And previously the way that this
bill was described as it was a
hundred percent certain so now
we're going from a hundred to
sixty and I wonder if the public
looks at that and wonders about
things and then you look at
what K. course the forty percent
going.
well part of it goes to public
school teacher compensation what
I don't think people are really
going to want to argue that most
people on the street when you
pass do teachers deserve a raise
I'd be shocked if you found
someone that said no I disagree
with that.
But when you talk about
something tying this into
enhanced or no student extending
the school year then I think
people maybe start to get a
little uncomfortable because are
you talking about adding hours
on to the existing school day
are we talking about adding
calendar days on to the school
year and if it's the latter.
Then I I start to worry if
you're gonna lose sort of your
role people who who run a farm
who run restaurants summertime
in the summer months.
People who want to travel their
family whatever the cases and so
I just wonder by adding the sort
of additional elements are we
making it harder to get the
people of New Mexico behind this
and approve it and I I just love
your thoughts on sorted out
analysis.
Mr speaker John from San Juan no
I think I think they don't have
overwhelming support I I really
do
I think that New Mexico is rated
kind just left hand cuffs the
historical hand cups that was
placed on our state land trust
and to utilize this to the best
of our ability we don't have to
spend all the money it's merely.
Making it liquid for the
appropriators to build out this
early childhood system so I
think any apprehension spokesman
have with regards to the.
The K. to twelve component I
think will be over overshadowed
by the early at and and then you
have your your case of twelve
allies advocating for the the
bill as well so I think I'll be
a great way to educate our
citizens a great rate educators
his citizens with regards to the
history of our state our
relationship with with the
sovereign the US government and
and you know hopefully it'll be
a just a good civil exercise
over the next eighteen months
and then hopefully we'll have
these funds available up as
appropriators up two years from
now next in January of twenty
three.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo I appreciate the
insight I I I I think it's so
fascinating to have is going to
discussions and think through
now how's the public going to
handle propose conscious
equipment how they can react.
and all I guess I'll start
making this podcast on your you
and get back to the specific
questions on the bill
so again this went from.
A hundred percent of the one
percent going early childhood to
now sixty percent of the one
point two five percent.
have you run the numbers is is
that going to end up being less
money going to.
Early childhood education even
though it's a it's a higher one
point two five percent and one
percent but not only taken sixty
percent of that so how did those
numbers come out from the house
version verses the Senate
version.
Mr speaker John from San Juan so
the house version was one
percent for education.
Which would have been
approximately let's just say a
hundred eighty million in two
years so we'll use that that
number hundred eighty million
dollars annually.
Now it's sixty percent but it's
sixty percent of one point two
five so it actually didn't drop
to point six it dropped two
point seven five so instead of
one percent for education it's
not point seven percent for
early education or three fourths
of one percent and so that will
drop it from say a hundred fifty
million annually to maybe a
hundred twenty million annually
only to grow far exceeding
inflation as we know that the
fund will continue to grow.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo so
Senator proposal will result in
smaller dollars going or or
fewer dollars going into the
early childhood education but
but doesn't sound like a pretty
small not at least not a
substantial not only with the
right attitude is there but
they're still going to be quite
a bit dollars going to early
childhood education is that
correct Mr speaker job of
someone correct so significant
distribution early education
without raising a dime in taxes.
Mr speaker gentleman from
Bernalillo.
I'm I'm curious also.
Just sort of the traductor of
this bill was were more
increasing.
This distribution by one percent
that's going solely to early
childhood education
and then somewhere in the Senate
process the idea was put forward
to not only increases by another
additional quarter percent but
we're also going to add in
another beneficiary
that that gets forty percent and
so can you help me understand.
what what was the discussion
committee about why would we
change sort of not the entire
direction of of this house joint
resolution but at least you know
forty percent of it and and why
we chair of endorsed this kind
of change.
Mr speaker John from San Juan
That was a what the Senate has
been contributing to this
dialogue as you recall in two
thousand sixteen the Senate in
fact passed the Senate a Senate
joint resolution increasing the
distribution point eight percent
point eight percent
in two thousand sixteen but that
was for K. through twelve so
this is actually been a five
year run the Senate in two
thousand sixteen passed a point
eight and then the house in the
last four years passed a one
percent but for early at so the
house has been pushing increased
distributions for the at the
Senate has been pushing
increased distributions for K.
through twelve in fact the
majority floor leader on the
first day of the session
introduced Senate joint
resolution one which was a one
percent increase for K. through
twelve.
So the minds of melted in Senate
finance the Senate was concerned
about
the the the Yazzie plaintiffs
concerns with regards to the
case through twelve system and
wanted to put more money into
that system
and so that was the the
compromise amongst the
leadership of the Senate is
instead of giving up the point
one they increased it
A point two five percent and
then defeat that up accordingly
so I think it's a great
compromise I think it's a I
think it's the best of both
worlds and now.
And I know we're grateful for
that for that change.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo
as a freshman I don't have that
institutional knowledge that's
that's helpful for me and an
understanding of this this
didn't come this out of left
field on the Senate side sounds
like it's been a dialogue it's
been going on for years.
This this effort of HDR one had
support out of the house and and
you know obviously the times was
right on the Senate side some
are those two ideas so I
appreciate that that
institutional knowledge now I I
do notice as you referenced
earlier section three when you
talk about what you have to go
to Congress to get approval for
it does in fact only reference
paragraph two of subsection H..
And so I guess I just I'm I'm
wondering again as we've been
through these issues about
what to support these amendments
are not.
When we specify distributions
the public the public school
permanent fund.
When we targeted to sixteen
school year and public school
teacher compensation does seem
to me like they are our two new
focuses of probably allocate
those funds.
and I may be wrong on that maybe
are doing that but it's not why
wouldn't we also just include
subparagraph one and what we
send to Congress just to be safe
because we got a Senator anyways
why not just just log both
paragraph wanted to.
Mr speaker Jonathan someone the
up the Senate particularly of.
Of senator Dick on the lady
who's a lawyer in his private
life.
Felt very strongly that that the
money going to early education
was in fact a new beneficiary
and that we needed the
permission or consent to run
their of Congress in order to
allocate funds to that new
beneficiaries so that was the
dialogue on the Senate side
that you know better safe than
sorry this is a a new
beneficiary it's a new
department but it's not head
and so that was kind of the
thought process for that the
money going to pad for specific
programs I we no one really was
concerned that that's a new
beneficiary
Everyone's pretty confident that
money that goes to pad for the
K. through twelve system.
Is is part of our common school
system that's that's you know
decades and decades old so
nobody really had that could
seem concerned that you have now
So yeah I think we're fine with
the K. to twelve I think I think
we were fine with the early had
I don't think section three
needs to be there it's like we
don't put in built up you know
the distribution of this house
bill two is is can not going to
affect without the consent of
the governor.
So I'm gonna tease empties about
of the next a couple months but
they feel compelled to put it in
there they felt compelled that
the early at distribution was a
new beneficiary and that that
the trust contract between the
US government in the state of
Mexico even though we're
supposedly on equal footing with
all the other states
You know we're gonna we're gonna
in power our citizens to vote
for this and power are you
rational delegation hopefully
educate the entire Congress on
the great state of New Mexico
and just turn it into a
positive.
Mr speaker John from early I
actually really appreciate that
last perspective let's let's
turn this into a way to
highlight what we're doing for
students here.
I I just this is probably just
maybe just an academic exercise
because I can't imagine raising
a challenge again giving more
money to teachers but as I read
through these amendments and
I don't know these dollars of
ever been pointed specifically
at state public school teacher
compensation or experience going
here so I'm just curious if
we're going to send Congress
money will need some paragraph
one
but apparently there's a lot of
confidence around that and and
it's not necessary.
The.
I want to talk about sort of the
timeline I guess that that
sending this to Congress in the
during which I think is kind of
unfortunate by product because
you're you're a rational earlier
when we use like the ValuJet
kindergarten adding that on the
that that makes sense to me.
about why we would not have to
since the Congress and what why
does Congress care if we're not
spending their money are they
really going to intervene I
think that's just bad publicity
for for any congressmen to take
that that able so the the the
likelihood of that ever
happening seems extremely low to
me.
but I know that's in the bill
now so I just like to have a
better understanding and for
anybody the public that's
watching this they kind of have
an idea of what what time when
they can expect.
So if we can Kerr on this today.
these also want resolutions
don't have to be signed by the
governor is that right.
Mr speaker John from San Juan
correct and so when when would
this one about are we talking to
member twenty one November of
twenty two one with this
initiative going about.
Mr speaker John from San Juan so
It'll go on the ballot to be
submitted to the people for
their approval or rejection at
the next general election which
is a November of twenty twenty
two.
November okay Mister speaker or
I've been saying Mr speaker I
for last twenty minutes I'm so
Sparky Madam speaker and you
traveling down look at the
patience you have shown.
Thank you.
Because I can see.
Yeah I'm not calling you a
gentleman from Bernalillo call
myself because I'm looking right
at the speaker equipment do it's
gentle lady Madam speaker so
there's my apologies.
Madam speaker and I lost lost
Richard Bach I'm so we're
talking about the the timeline
that the public may expect so
November of two thousand twenty
two is when this house joint
resolution will appear on the
ballot if we can Kerr today is
that right.
Mr speaker John from San Juan
correct the secretary of state
will essentially be compelled to
put it on the ballot at the next
general election so the voters
will get to decide on November
of twenty twenty two.
And madam speaker John from
Bernalillo
I'm certainly not gonna hold
additional just again just gonna
wait for tourists and and so the
people at home have an idea to
let's assume it gets approved in
November of twenty two
then the next step is the send
us the Congress at least be the
forty percent or.
So do we know kind of a rough
timeline of how long we
anticipate to hear back from
Congress if this is passed by
voters.
Mr speaker John from San Juan
all great question we haven't
got a conversation since ninety
seven.
When we
Did some weird things with the
with the act and our ability to
manage the land but
so yeah I think what happens is
once the secretary of state
certifies the election which is
maybe mid November.
then Congress will decide
hopefully before Christmas.
And then we and then we go into
session a month later.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
our madam secretary general from
Bernalillo so when you say we're
going to session a month later
do we have to I'm just trying
for a wide so that do we have to
vote to as a body to then send
us there Congress after the
voters passage.
Mr speaker job from someone no
I'm just saying that the the
elect you know the for the
constitution we go into session
the third Tuesday of January so
that's what I meant by that.
And Madam speaker gentleman from
Bernalillo so I mean we're
talking about a few months to
get an answer from Congress to
the end if they have to take
this up as a bill and passed it
through and the president signed
it or what what's the process on
the on the side.
Mr speaker generals I want a
great question will it'll be fun
learning about this but I don't
believe it needs the president's
signature but I believe it needs
to go through Congress so we'll
just assume both houses of
Congress our senior our senior
member of our delegations US
senator Martin Heinrich boll is
proud to carry the legislation
looking forward to it and
knowing Congress it'll just be
tacked on the some big old bill
somewhere and it will pass the
test that way but will give us
another of beautiful day to
celebrate.
And madam speaker Jim from
Bernalillo it and like I
mentioned earlier I can't
imagine anyone for Congress
would oppose this and I hope
they don't in or Mexico
delegation will do a good job of
during the service the will of
the of the voters but it sounds
like that piece were we're
looking at probably best case
scenario early early two
thousand twenty three.
and and maybe even metal of two
thousand twenty three but
hopefully by what what I guess I
guess I've become fiscal year of
two thousand twenty four we talk
about July one of two thousand
twenty four but somewhere in
that time frame is that's on
right Mr speaker John from
someone even sooner than that
anticipating you know one
secretary state ratifies the
election assuming the voters
approve of it so let's say that
since November fifteen and that
gives us five weeks before
Christmas I'm thinking in that
time frame between thanksgiving
and Christmas twenty twenty two.
So we'll know by new year's.
And then we'll come into session
you know the third Tuesday no in
January with access to that to
that funding.
Madam speaker John from
Bernalillo so you're you're
hoping this will be one of the
guests that you want to wrap and
Christmas of two thousand twenty
three is what I'm hearing.
Mr speaker Jeff was on one of.
Yeah we know the gift is coming
in December of twenty two and
then we get to unwrap the gift
officially July first at the
beginning of the fiscal year
fiscal year twenty four which
starts July first twenty twenty
three.
So there's a lot of not a
beautiful bows and I gift Madam
speaker.
Madam speaker gentleman from San
Juan I I appreciate your
patience and understanding my
understanding an answering.
Options I have on the minutes
the the amendment Sir.
They're not just sort of you
know facial these go to the
substance of the bill New Mexico
pretty substantive changes I
appreciate you walking through
that.
I know it's been helpful for me
I will say that when I heard
your your discussion with the
other gentleman from San Juan my
my much much older Nibert
Representative Strickler need.
I was a little disappointed to
hear that in that debate that
your financial literacy bill is
stalled on the Senate side so I
hope there's something that can
be done on that front.
Because if you think that makes
a real difference when we talk
about this this idea of in
reaching education as your
equipment and as H. R. one does.
That's another really practical
way that we can help our
students across New Mexico so I
truly do help that that that
bill sees the light of day on
the Senate floor and passes
through I know we're running out
of time.
and so I I do wish you all the
best on that as well so again
thank you my friend from
Bernalillo madam speaker I yield
back.
We have further debate the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
Santa and Santa Fe
Representative Lord.
One second to get my microphone
here.
Thank you madam chair and will
the gentleman really can you
please yield the floor.
Madam chair I yield thank you
your the gentle lady from
One two counties.
Thank you.
Thank you madam speaker I do
have some questions on there
I'll be fairly brief
my representative here to the
gentleman from on the left to me
asked a whole bunch of amazing
questions thank you for that.
What I do want to ask is so my
degree is in my first degree is
I have a certificate early
childhood education and.
Which is amazing job you make a
lot of finger puppets and egg
salad sandwiches and you work
hard to get paid very little
money I could tell you that from
experience so I I just had some
and I'll be fairly reasons
questioning but what I wanted to
know is have there been an
increase or decrease in the
amount of young children in the
state of New Mexico.
Madam speaker jelly from
Bernalillo Santa Santa Fe at the
the the.
Less babies are being born these
days than in the past so there
there's less kids going into the
first grade.
Then than say a decade or two
decades ago it's it's slightly
declined that's my
understanding.
And thank you madam speaker John
from I can I do have more
questions on that.
So what I'm trying to figure out
with this
we're going to be putting more
money from the permanent fund
into early childhood education.
And I know we have.
Head start so this would be
completely different from what
we already have the federal
funds coming from head start is
that correct.
Madam speaker jelly from
Bernalillo Santa Santa Fe so
yeah it'll it'll it'll be for
this the programs administered
by the state.
Thank you I appreciate that
thank you madam chair madam
chair and gentleman from
Bernalillo county so we have I
think it's seventy million
dollars already going into
early starts are which is
separate from that.
So what I'm.
When I'm wondering about because
the importation part with
there's been a lot of
conflicting studies when it
comes to early childhood
education.
And the hardest thing for me
when I first went to schools I
talked about the I believe is a
Westinghouse study where they
said there was really no
significant increase not saying
we don't need early childhood
education to showing that has
been a significant increase in
the next so that was another
study as well that was recent
and again.
They studied five thousand
children and they collected the
data and there wasn't a
significant increase when you
test these children from the
beginning two years later.
So what I'm trying to figure out
is was there a study done and
specifically in New Mexico to
show that we needed more funding
for pre K..
From Bernalillo Sandoval
something where there's not been
a study necessarily
but there but there is a unmet
need there's been several
several
Reports on that I guess the one
of them was a study back in two
thousand fifteen the unmet need
at the time was like four
hundred million million dollars
they now the unmet need is
somewhere the neighborhood of a.
Three hundred dollars but yeah
there is definitely unmet need
if and obviously it's not
required for the kids to attend
but but for it to be available
for every child in New Mexico
there's a.
There's there's a significant
unmet need in the neighborhood
of two to three hundred million
dollars.
Thank you madam chair and and
gentleman and then that's a the
what I'm trying to figure out is
when I go back to my district my
people are going to pass my
consent just gonna say what was
this bill about what was going
on and why so that's why I
always ask I try to ask
questions so when the state to
be you know what was the purpose
of this I can at least go back
and tell them and and I have a
hard time sometimes when there's
not.
I don't see like we did some
sort of assessment in New Mexico
and we found that yes putting
kids in pre Kate gave a huge up
with to them and again I'm not
saying that we don't need early
childhood education to saying
it's hard sometimes when I see
money that's going to be that
did you and I do have a question
did you say that they were going
to.
I guess how do we know how much
of this money when it's being
taken out is going to be
allocated specifically to early
childhood education.
Madam speaker delay from Santa
Santa Fe what we know because
it's in the constitution the
people that voted for it and
we're legally bound by that
By that.
By the constitution and so the
that money will be essentially
earmarked for the early
education department.
And thank you madam chair Mister
speaker doing no I what
percentage like how much of the
percentages going specifically
to early childhood education.
Madam speaker delay from
Bernalillo Santa Santa Fe
pursuant to the sentiments point
seventy five percent annual
distribution so that's
approximately a hundred twenty
million dollars that will then
grow as the fund grows so so
when the fund doubles then the
allocation annually will be two
hundred forty million dollars so
I think up I think if so you
know the one percent were to
continue to be allocated it
would get up to.
Get up to
It looks like half a billion
dollars in about twenty five
years now that it's a point
seven it may take a little
longer so they'll they'll still
need to be general fund money
spent
but yeah a point seven five
percent will but will be
earmarked for relief at.
Thank you madam speaker John
Brown and that was the number I
was looking for because I know
we there was a bunch of numbers
in here and I didn't see that
one specifically and possibly to
ad agency that for what is going
towards early childhood
education and then I'm
understanding and and I'm sorry
I missed the part when justice
go on the ballot.
Thank you madam chair goes on
the ballot thank you madam
speaker gently from Bernalillo
Santa Santa Fe it goes on the
ballot Jr and the November
general election on November of
twenty twenty two also assuming
we all will run again and and
when our primaries it'll it'll
be the next time we're on that
general election ballot of but
to up but to get to your
previous question you're correct
but I'm a feminist figures away
from Bernalillo Santa wasn't
very it's written weird it's
written sixty percent sixty
percent is the magic words but
in the preceding page it says
one and one fourth percent so
it's sixty percent of the one
and one fourth percent so that's
why I use the term point seven
five but but in the constitution
it will it will read sixty
percent of one and one quarter
percent.
Thank you for that thanks for
the clarification madam speaker
and gentleman from Bernalillo
county I think what I think so
we'll look to seen in this but I
know this is part going outside
the scope is we give this money
and then we do some follow up
like was it beneficial what can
we do that was better you know I
mean like maybe we're not
hitting the target maybe this
isn't the right type early
childhood education because
that's what I mean when in the
state is a controversial right
there's a bunch of state doesn't
work in the some of the ones it
says it does use them
specifically incorrectly I would
love to just seen that extra and
we'll be doing assessments on is
it working right because we do
have a problem with our
education system we need to fix
that we really do on all levels
in the state of New Mexico and I
would love to figure out a way
that it the end result is okay
we did this one thing that
didn't quite work but we're
going to try this other program
and it works great this is the
magic bullet this is someone
that we should adage so with
that I thank you for answering
my questions I go back to my
constituents and answer those
for you and our answer that for
them and I yield my time thank
you.
We have further debate the
gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln representative Nibert.
Thank you madam speaker of a
gentleman from Bernalillo county
yield that speaker I yield.
Madam speaker and gentleman
I've been out meeting with some
of your colleagues on some other
bills that are making their way
so I may be repeating some of
the questions that were asked
earlier and I apologize I'm
going to focus specifically on
on just one all right.
That one item is we have a
number of beneficiary
institutions that receive.
Part of the funds that are
generated from the
Our permanent fund.
And so my question madam speaker
and gentleman is with respect to
those institutions of one of
those institutions has a helmet
that's right over your right
shoulder and the that's the one
that is in my district one that
blacks are deeply about that's
New Mexico military institute
and that has I believe the New
Mexico military institute is a
yes Sir I really like what the
hell.
I'm I'm wondering how you got
one and I did.
Maybe I'll have to ask the
general but but my question is
Madam speaker and gentleman.
New Mexico military institute
obviously does not have early
childhood education in fact they
are have a curriculum for the
freshman year in high school
through two years of junior
college so essentially
students in the age of what
would that be about thirteen or
fourteen on up through about age
twenty one your are the students
that are.
New Mexico military institute.
New Mexico military institute is
I believe the second largest
Recipient of a bunch from the
permanent fund.
And only surpassed by the common
schools.
And that's a factor the reason
for that is not because they
have more land or anything it's
because the lands of fate have
dedicated to them have been very
productive over oil and gas.
New Mexico military institute my
questions element is we're
taking the
percentage were increasing the
percentage to in excess of six
percent is that correct.
Mr speaker John from Travis
Lincoln up for the common
schools for the common schools
it is being the proposal is to
raise at one point two five
percent or raise it from five to
six point two five however of
the sentiments took away the one
percent increase distribution
for the remaining beneficiaries
so for the twenty
other beneficiaries there
distribution remains at five
percent of the preceding five
year rolling average and so
madam speaker and gentleman I'd
like to talk about how that is
going to be accomplished because
as I understand it the entire
fund gets invested the
percentage of.
Drawdown if you will or the
percentage that's paid out each
year is based on a five year
average.
And it's a percentage of that
five year average.
And the distribution is then
made to the various institutions
that make up the beneficiaries
of the land grant permanent.
If only the common schools.
Are receiving the secretary
benefit.
Is that extra benefit going to
result in a draw down of the
school that the other
beneficiary institutions are.
I have available to them not
only do this next year but for
many years to follow and is that
is the effect of this
legislation going to reduce the
size of the.
Our Corpus if you will for each
of those other benefits for
institutions and.
I I I just I see that I may not
have asked a very clear question
on on your responsibilities you
may answer fine if not I can I
can try to raise my question a
little better madam chair
general Mr speaker John from
Travis Lee and I totally get
where you're coming from that is
a great question I believe the
answer is is is no.
because the state investment
council knows which squares
raise which amounts of dollars
and and and what those
investments draw on
I think they I think they they
put all the money in a pool and
kinda average out the investment
but the percentage that's
earmarked for that institution I
believe will remain
and will probably increase
because that distribution is not
increasing my one point two five
percent.
But the other twenty
beneficiaries of their their
earmarked monies in the land
grant permanent fund collecting
interest and the money derived
from state lands on their
particular sections going into
the fund in their name will
remain the same.
But I I heard everybody to get
to to increase the same that way
that question you just asked
isn't relevant but the Senate
Didn't do that.
And so madam speaker and
gentlemen so ten years down the
road twenty years down the road.
For for ease of of mass
let's just started today New
Mexico military institute has.
Five percent of the total.
In your twenty.
We would expect sense there are.
Payments each year or going to
be based on a lower percentage
on the common schools twenty
years out.
The.
The benefits are institutions
that did not have the early
education programs tab all of
the institution of the except
for the common schools should
have a bigger percentage twenty
years out and the common schools
is that how you understand it
madam chair or madam speaker and
gentleman.
Madam speaker John from Travis
link and I believe so I believe
that there percentages will inch
up because their distribution is
lower than the COVID schools
right now the COVID schools is
that eighty six percent so
that's definitely keep our eye
on that of the you know.
Through throughout the years
Mimi Valley we're not New Mexico
military institute as you know
is the second largest
beneficiary of some sections of
latter more lucrative than
others
and so the New Mexico military
institute has a
Two point eight three two
percent distribution I think
that'll inch up as the committee
only distributing five percent
of its fund and the COVID
schools which is eighty six
point two five percent will be
distributing at a a disturbing
rather at a six point two five
but to answer your question yes
the up the percentages of the
twenty other beneficiaries to
shins up will probably end up
over time.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
I know that I and some of my
colleagues have.
Debated this issue of
increasing the percentage are to
be paid out each year a number
of times and and you bet all the
other end of of this debate a
number of times and so Madam
speaker and gentleman.
I really hope that in ten years
after this is put into effect I
hope that in ten years after
this occurs I hope that we can
revisit this issue because I
think it will clearly made the
point.
That some of my fellow
representatives have made
time and again about the fact of
the increased percentage
drawdown so to speak over time
and what the expectations are
just a one percent increase is
going to have on the corpus can
and one years out and so I I
challenge you Mr madam chair or
madam speaker and gentleman I
challenge you to observe to
allow us the opportunity you
don't have to be on the floor
but I challenge you to have an
opportunity to sit down and
let's look at the numbers ten
years or so out at and really
be in a position to show the
body because I I I don't think
that the body as a whole really
grant.
The concept that we've been
trying to communicate that I
just a one what a quarter
percent increase what the
tremendous impact that's going
to have on the corpus and the
corpus is really the amount of
money that future generations
are going to have to rely on
because in ten twenty years yes
good wine program oil and gas
the
does what it predictably does
all the time and the gentleman
from wake county can talk more
about that than I.
But the decline curve is going
to be running against us.
We have a resource that for
based on comments in this body
is a resource that that will
maybe not be in existence of a
number of years and we have the
only thing left is the money
that has been placed in those
permanent fund plus maybe a.
A few dollars coming in from
maybe one of our maybe solar
facilities possibly our
agriculture that has been a
contributor over the years but
we're going to see the the the
largesse of oil and gas reduce
and we're going to see how the
investments are going to have to
keep that.
Permanent fund in good shape and
I really would hope that we have
an opportunity to sit down
really critically looked at the
numbers and be able to show
people what the effect of this
legislation yes the people in
the act what it will have on
that our Corpus in years out
some Madam speaker and gentleman
thank you for explaining the
changes the Senate made I'm not
particularly are two thrilled
with them I know general wrestle
will not be too happy with them
of the the that's what our our
brother and sisters that over on
the other other chamber and I
guess what your recommendation
to accept there are chains
wasn't not.
At this late hour a I'm gonna
recommended the body
That the body a concur with the
sentiments.
Hi madam speaker I guess maybe
to that point.
Madam speaker and gentleman
thank you for giving me that
prove your and I will be open
for thank you.
Madam speaker.
I'm I've been on the board.
To speak on this.
Hi my board is lit up.
Thank you generating you are.
Your doctor slide down the list
okay next Representative speak
is a gentleman from Chavis
Indian arts aero Representative
Townsend.
Then we'll go to the gentleman
from we Representative Scott.
Speaker will the gentleman from
Bernalillo.
Madam speaker I yield to the
gentleman from the.
General general.
One from Bernalillo.
What is.
The team that does not have the
budget throughout.
One gas revenue in coming every
here would be spared to sorry
that most managers of those
minorities would do a
representative.
That jobs four and a half truths
lost percent.
Would be the maximum allowable
withdrawal to run reliably
maintain the corpus of the the
notice that is that your
understanding also served.
Madam speaker John from the yes
that's what the the folks back
east the.
Tell us so madam speaker and
gentleman can you explain to a
body.
Why.
The permanent fund continues to
grow.
From the you've just you've
touched on on the whole crux of
of what we've been talking about
particularly the last couple
years is that we don't
distribute five percent.
We don't for this fiscal year we
didn't transfer eight hundred
thirty six million dollars from
the letter permanent fund to the
general fund in one day.
What we do is you know madam
speaker John from Lee as we do
it in twelve monthly transfers
beginning in the fiscal year so
that first transfer on July
first is up five and a half
years from that first variable
and then the last transfer on
June first at the end of the
fiscal year.
Is six and a half years from
that last variable or minus one
month and so when you calculate
the the distribution in real
time the last distribution on
February first given what the
fund was the night before was
actually a three point eight
seven percent distribution three
point eight seven so at the end
of the fiscal year on June first
pry get down to like three point
seven five maybe three point
seven
and so and so that's why the one
percent increase is reasonable
and the one point two five
percent increases reasonable
because that gets us within that
four point five five percent
threshold that you that you
mentioned if it's strictly
financial growth then then.
You know don't go for don't go
higher than I so we're at three
point eight seven.
With a second funding source
which is money from royalties
from the State Land Office which
in the past two year the past
two fiscal years prior to this
one was upwards of nine hundred
million dollars so not only is
it growing at seven point five
eight percent but it's getting
an influx of cash of the last
two years nine hundred million
dollars so that the the fund as
you as you know madam speaker
John from Lee and the last
eleven years is drawn one
hundred seventeen percent while
the distribution has grown fifty
six percent so anyway in terms
of generate generational equity
we're short changing the current
generation the current
generation is is getting gypped
if our goal is generational
equity so anyway you're correct
we don't want to go higher than
I because we have this wonderful
a five year rolling average and
because we allocated per month
and that money stays in
investment account to the very
very end still collecting
interest by doing a six point
two five percent annual
distribution with the five year
rolling average actually will be
right around four point nine
four point eight in real time.
Gentleman from Bernalillo
Senator conversations here
about.
Having a break could we could we
all the proceedings for just a
moment.
Thank you thank you madam
speaker thank you gentleman
instructed to keep asking
questions so.
Your.
What.
What's allowed is the up to.
Creations in
you for.
Okay.
Well we're not getting the full
five percent average coupled
with the substantial increase in
our revenues going into the
fund.
Madam speaker John from Travis
and the I'm sorry Jennifer Lee
yes yes because we we do it it's
such a awesome Wade we
we take the five year rolling
average but more importantly we
allocated in twelve monthly
transfers throughout the fiscal
year so those dollars remaining
the account to the very very end
collecting interest so so you're
correct when the stock market is
growing at a healthy clip then
the distribution gets down to
four and now it's four point
eight seven
when the stock market even evens
out then that's when the
distribution gets you know
between that four point five
five percent it only went above
five percent
Madam chair of the during the
banking crisis we're actually at
five point eight at that time
but then it leveled off about a
year later yeah we
we
Are we don't we do not
distribute five percent of the
funds last four years I think
the average is four point one
four percent of the fund.
That the money that's actually
coming out of the fund.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman from Bernalillo that's
consequence of substantial
increases in revenue inflows to
respond and the five year
rolling average is that at your
I understand Mr speaker Mr
totally yes correct when the
fund is growing at a healthy
clip than the distribution.
It is extremely low like it is
now so yeah it's because of the
health of the fund.
and the consistent growth of the
fund the past five years.
This lowered that distribution
in real time below for.
For.
Madam speaker and gentleman what
also services are effective for
revenue stream was stable.
Use the
if they can flows through the
frontier coupled with returns
from these investments in the
fund was stable.
Hello for withdrawals sure
stabilize somewhere down much
rolling average that's five
percent would that be accurate.
Madam speaker don't fully yes.
Okay.
Speaker and gentleman.
We're coming to my concern with
this legislation.
As.
The policy.
Of this legislature's.
To some.
L. reliance on the oil and gas
industry.
So madam speaker and gentleman
there is a time coming.
And.
Well
trained actors is restore
mandating work.
What we do.
So.
Madam speaker.
With me that there is a time in
the relatively.
New.
Twenty five years been
relatively near.
Then we will have to rely on
something besides oil and gas.
The revenues and requirements on
yes Senator.
Would you would you believe that
presenters.
Madam speaker John from the of
that's certainly the the concern
and the back of everyone's mind
I I would suggest a no two quick
points one as it grows through
financial investments in the
financial investments by
themselves is someone the
neighborhood of seven point
seven or seven point eight
projected over thirty years so
with up.
With a six point two five
percent five year rolling
average then you're you're stuck
the fund is still growing simply
by financial investments in in
outpacing inflation.
The inflows from the state land
office these days are primarily
from oil and gas drilling if not
you know ninety five percent and
there tremendously healthy so
when those when oil and gas
You know.
Decreases let's just say it
decreases in twenty five years
then that the fund is still
growing to financial investments
but I don't think.
There's still a a worldwide
demand for crude oil the energy
transition act deals with
With electricity you know there
still cars there's still things
of that nature so they're still
going to be a demand when that
demand decreases.
then I think that that'll
decrease any need we have for
foreign oil I think domestic oil
will still be a of those still
be a demand for that and I think
hopefully New Mexico will will
have the last the last claim
rigs in the country
Far into the future.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
It's certainly possible to
convert.
The million barrels of oil a day
or.
That we're producing.
One.
Yes there were petitions we can
that.
Number.
That's yes.
Converging factors which
accepted by UPS so it is the.
State to be carbon Shuri I do
too.
By definition oil and gas and
our reliance on those revenues
is gonna have to significantly
diminished.
We are.
Madam speaker and gentleman will
slow from oil and gas.
Linings surely going away.
One we rely strictly on the
revenue generated.
The investment returns in the
fund.
And we just discussed what the
actuaries will agree yes I
withdrawals from the salon.
One investment returns only on
the order of for the house to
five percent.
Point would be necessary to
revisit this section a quarter
percent.
To see if we could maintain the
corpus in the full.
Would you believe that degree.
Just possible.
Madam speaker generally yes if
all we cared about was the
amount of money in the fund.
If all we cared about was the
amount of money in the fund.
Then yes and I don't want to
dismiss your concerns I I I I I
agree with you know here we are
coming from but this is the
whole point the whole point is
to utilize this money that's not
doing anybody any good in the
mattress and investing it in
early childhood education to
build human capital to heal
generation generational curses
of poverty and despair to to
have students going into
kindergarten and first grade you
know knowing all their colors
numbers letters ready to to read
by the third grade so that
they're reading to learn not
learning to read on into the
fourth and fifth grade that that
we have higher graduation rates
folks going to college if they
so choose starting their own
businesses being taxpayers
instead of being a drain on the
treasury through social programs
that in twenty five years or you
know when when oil goes down to
zero one which I believe will
but when oil goes down to zero
we will have New Mexicans with
their own economies and their
own lives in a modern world
that's the point that's the
point you know so we can save
this money up and spend a
wilderness expended on the next
generation of poor kids or we
can tackle and confront head on
of the root causes of of this
poverty and despair and overcome
it overcome it as New Mexicans.
Madam speaker and gentleman I'm.
You're aware of the magic.
That is associated with compound
interest.
In
this sense.
And.
We commence to withdrawing six
and a quarter percent from that
fund rolling average obviously.
If we commenced to doing that.
Year old.
More revenue.
For our constituents.
For how many years would have.
We stayed with the five percent.
Are you Sir.
Forgive me forgive me the mute I
open the window and it's windy
thank you Mr generally no that's
a great point and that's really
the that's really what we need
to decide
And what the voters are gonna
have to decide you know if this
is a if if if we win this
concurrence tonight is at some
point the distribution to the
general fund will be less that
would be less than now granted
the fund will still continue to
grow the fund will continue to
exceed inflation of the the
transfer from the permanent fund
to the general fund will will
still benefit our state in our
state budget.
Well but in some point and I
think it's your twenty four or
so.
The distribution will be in fact
less in in real dollars and so
the question is when we reach
that point will the tax base of
by this this new modern society
will that tax based overcome
that investment so getting back
to your preceding question what
we have to revisit the fund to
replenish the fund that's not
going to be the calculus before
it before our predecessors as
policy makers what's going to be
before the predecessors twenty
five years from now is is this
dollar a good investment is this
dollar that we're taking out of
the fund wisely spent should we
continue to spend that dollar
similarly should we spend more
of it and so we have to get off
this this.
This notion of the fund being
being just individualized as
opposed to what is the
possibilities with regards to
the financial resources of the
fund to benefit New Mexico into
benefit New Mexicans so so when
that tipping point occurs and I
and the General Fund received
less dollars than it would have
but for the increased
distribution
was it in our interest and and I
think the answer is going to be
unequivocally yes.
Madam speaker and gentleman well
All well as a number it sure and
try to make.
The.
The second quarter distribution
will yield more revenue.
Right up until the year twenty
forty two.
That's only twenty years from
now yeah we're here there ask
for in perpetuity.
For.
Less revenue will be available
from the school on the then we
would have had we stayed.
With the five percent.
That's twenty years and then the
scope of hope in the state of
New Mexico will be around
forever is virtually no amount
of time.
Madam speaker.
What let me let me.
Now if I could to the
utilization of this increased
revenue.
We've done this once before we
have taken additional a
percentage of revenue outlet
fund once before now.
I believe of following the
conversation there is a
significant portion of this.
Increase revenue string that
would be a dog forwarded toward
education specifically in this
early childhood programs is that
correct.
Minister to minister definitely
yes correct a point seven five.
distribution will be earmarked
specifically for early
educational programs early
childhood education.
So.
Speaker and gentleman are you
aware.
Of the funding that has gone
into early childhood programs.
Two thousand and ten or two
thousand twenty.
Madam speaker generally yes it's
been set significant increases
In investment in early
childhood.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
Number is forty million dollars
in two thousand and two PM.
Two hundred million dollars in
two thousand twenty to second
port was.
With the to help.
Let us figure jump from the yes
yes it's been significant I
think this year the the general
fund expenditures one hundred
ninety one million but there's
also federal funding I think
that gets gets us to that three
hundred million that you
mentioned so madam speaker and
gentleman should we not have
seen already given that this
program has of spiritual.
Increasing numbers over that
time period we moved the needle.
Madam speaker generally I I
believe we have the LFC staff
does a heck of a job of
monitoring these programs.
the
legislative finance committee
scrutinises you know
like hawks and like the gentle
lady from up.
From Bernalillo Sandoval Santa
Fe was mentioning is that they
need to be quality programs
because the.
The studies done by Dr Heckman
from the university kago in the
other studies that have that are
nationally renowned and
You know with the peer review
and all that good stuff and the
it talks about quality early
childhood education program so
that's the key that's the key
and so as we build out the
systems they must be quality
early childhood programs and and
I believe up there's you know
tons of anecdotal evidence
throughout the state of moms who
get to go to go to work in their
child has developed in terms of
social emotional skills and
things that nature but up but
you're right we really need to
do a hardcore study over the
next decade to see up to see the
benefit of these programs but I
believe that there
that the early childhood access
to really strong language in
statute if this passes will do
enabling legislation making it
even stronger but to answer your
question Mr down from the up I
believe it has moved the needle
for many many New Mexico
families.
Madam speaker and gentleman
specifically with respect to.
Third grade reading scores.
We want
move the needle and I completely
agree with you.
The quality program in that
entire area.
Pre K. through third grade.
Should result.
You
are not able to read.
Grade level in the third grade
and we are not there and I
believe I heard earlier in the
in the debate Madam speaker.
We this is quote from you Sir.
It's not.
But how do you.
And we sure.
Given the ten year history of
these increased expenditures we
sure have.
Seen some positive or
legislation.
Of these increases by ma'am.
Madam speaker and gentleman we
have not.
So madam speaker and gentleman
what that tells me.
Is that what we're doing.
We need to take a hard look at
what we're doing to see if we
can do it more expected late
with the same dollars before we
start talking about more
dollars.
Because.
I believe we.
Over the last two years.
The more dollars are not going
to necessarily solve the
problem.
Thank you madam speaker.
Thank you gentleman from
Bernalillo are pretty short the
debate all of your very thorough
cheers.
Are you.
There's further debate the
gentleman from Chavis Eddie
north Caro leader Townsend.
Thank you.
Madam speaker will the gentleman
yield.
Speaker I yield to the gentleman
from any of that and jobs thank
you Sir
I'm not gonna.
Be that dead horse.
just too long maybe a time or
two.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
Is there any reporting
mechanism.
Within your.
Within this proposed process.
This increased distribution R.
L. E. S. C. R. someone would
report back and said.
Legislator this was.
You spent this much money and
this is what you got out that is
that is that in the process.
Madam speaker gentle from Travis
city of federal that is
definitely part of the process
it's not however in the
legislation the legislation
merely is one point two five
percent so the legislation
allows more liquidity from the
investment account into the.
Checking account so to speak our
general fund but yes it is part
of the overall process where the
first state in the nation to
create specifically early
educational edge early childhood
education and care department we
have a nationally renowned early
childhood educational leader as
its secretary miss others with
Groginsky we are very you know
strong Madam chair real skills
from the chief executive at and
and and a slow and reasonable
and the thought of coal build
out of this system I think we
increased at like thirty million
this year hopefully we can
increase it thirty million.
Of each and every year so yeah
those those
I don't know what you would call
them might my brain is mush but
those quality control checks
those those evidence based
analyses of the purpose is part
of that process so that we spend
the money wisely and ensure that
those dollars are well spent the
way I picture it
Madam speaker John from Java
city that was that.
You know this is two years out
is not available for another
three years in the meantime we
can use the money in the current
early educational trust use that
to build out the system over the
next three years frankly use it
for the next five six and we
were when we run out of that
three hundred million then
the invests the a land grant
permanent fund will will have a
healthy up allocation of funds
for early education we don't
even hit the the top end of that
one of that point seven five for
pricing other decades so the
point is we don't have there
will be no financial constraints
and that's that's the key and
that's what Senator Smith.
Taught us it's the that the land
grant permanent fund is the most
reliable funding source and all
of state government and that
that was the impetus of the
Representative Martinez and and
my money so and the advocates
movement is to utilize the
letter permanent fund the most
of the most
consistent funding source and
all of state government for this
build out of early childhood
education so that we never ever
ever have to cut programs even
under the most dire of economic
times.
Madam chair and and gentleman.
I think we could have done that
and I still think it might be.
It would have been a lot more
palatable for me if with this
that this program up in a
tipping basket much like.
The rainy day fund Larry
Larranaga's Fund.
Where you protect the based on
what lows over.
Would go to the S. new at a next
step.
I realize that.
The funding.
stream that you have said that
probably is more.
Secure at least in the short
term.
But because of.
The corpus.
It's out of our of of the land
grant permanent fund.
But.
I.
I think if you look back in
history and look at the worst
years of return on the fund.
It definitely causes great
concern.
And.
I personally am in pretty
concerned about the the state.
Of our economy and as my.
Transcendental day we're
floating on a sea of federal
tax.
And
That's very troubling to me I I
think we're
We're spending a lot of money.
We're proposing that we spend a
lot of money.
That we have no.
Mechanism.
In place.
To monitor the back the last of
that expenditure and.
I I think it puts the corpus at
rest in times of downturn.
madam speaker the gentleman.
Hi
I wish
and I hope that in the process
of putting this out voters.
that they.
Let
The.
And to the rest associated with
that and the cost potential of
that going forward so thank you
madam speaker thank you John.
There's further debate the
gentle lady from Otero
Representative black.
Madam speaker.
Madam speaker we have discussed
with the two lawyers.
To ask unanimous consent to
pause the debate as the general
Bernalillo to Representative pas
presentation of the bill for
thirty minutes for dinner break.
madam speaker John Beilein to
yield that purpose.
Madam speaker delivers on
Thursday I yield.
Thank you madam speaker if I can
your given that we have
unanimous consent and other
consent and the gentleman to
build this house in recess for
thirty minutes.
No objection we are honored
generate.
House is in recess.
They're not.
So just.
A new tricks about.
Shut up it's more.
Members please come to the
chambers or the gym we are about
to begin.
The gentleman from Bernalillo we
are back on debate you have the
floor Representative Maestas.
Thank you madam speaker I have
once again staff to questions.
Madam speaker I believe these
are Mr Representative from
Chavis seven archer always
managed and so we're ready to
the next.
Person on the board.
Thank you we have further debate
the representatives from Otero
Representative black.
Thank you madam chair does the
gentleman from.
That county yield.
Madam speaker I yield to the
gentle lady.
Thank you John madam speaker I
just have a couple of questions
and.
Forgive me it's you know working
on little sleep last night I'm
so in the amendment it talks
about requiring congressional
approval for the distributions
can you give me an example what
what what what that looks like.
Thank you Mr jolly from of that
also.
As you recall a.
It took a long time for New
Mexico to become a state we have
the population to become a state
back in the eighteen fifties.
But we were bypassed by Utah
Wyoming of your practically
every other western state.
I don't hold Colorado justice
name on.
So finally you know it was
apparent that we had to become a
state and they wanted us to
point with Arizona so the
quickest Act was passed in
eighteen ninety eight.
Laying the groundwork for us to
become a state that the
government would the US
government would allow us to be
a state equal to all the other
states.
Comma but we're gonna tell you
how to manage your public lands
and what to do with the money
derived from your public lands
so we The New Mexicans voted and
we voted not to become one state
with Arizona.
Because you know they did they
wanted to kind of dilute the
demographics of of northern New
Mexico as a state so then twelve
years later in the day the
enabling act nineteen ten we
That that of congressional act
laid the groundwork for us to
become a state anyway to answer
your question in the in the it's
a trust the state lands that
were given to us by the US
government.
are are held in trust by the
state of New Mexico under the
congressional act the enabling
act nineteen ten that the state
lands and the money derived from
those state lands go to specific
institutional beneficiaries
which at the time was the
territorial government of the
state of Mexico so there's
twenty one beneficiaries.
If we were to remove a
beneficiary or to create a new
beneficiary essentially spend
the money that we we wanted to
as a free people we have we have
to get permission from from from
Congress Representative to get
the consent of Congress it was
the opinion of senator
Candelaria in the Senate and the
up and the lawyers who advise
the pro tem that by.
By increasing the or creating a
distribution I guess you could
say point seventy five early
childhood education that we are
in fact creating a new
beneficiary and therefore we
need the consent of Congress so
instead of just going to
Congress they actually put it in
the in the legislation so they
added section three of the
legislation madam speaker that
that the point seven five
distribution of will not go into
effect until we received the
consent of Congress so to answer
your question Mr jelly our
senior senator us to have on
hand right this protected do
that and so he will essentially
run legislation after the
election
and get congressional approval
so that we as appropriators and
spend the money the way we the
way the people of the state of
New Mexico want us to.
Thank you for that and gentleman
and madam speaker that explains
a lot believe it or not I'm.
I appreciate that so madam
speaker and gentleman.
I'm looking at the eight the
ability amendments in context.
On page three.
Section.
To me it just is is it redundant
language is a lawyer uses that
I can you can you talk a little
bit about that what do is try to
actually accomplish.
Thank you madam speaker
generated from hotel I think we
are distinguishes between the
land grant permanent fund and
the permanent school fund that
is kind of written kind of weird
and so it adds a one a one and
one quarter annual distribution
from the permanent school fund
so what that does is although
the twenty beneficiaries remain
at five percent distribution.
A permanent school fund
distribution grows to six point
two five.
And then in the next page
it divides that one and one
quarter distributions sixty
forty between early education
early childhood education and
are on K. to twelfth.
Thank you for that that
gentleman
And.
That Madam speaker so if any of
the portion of this this
increase goes unspent what
happens to the what happens
those dollars.
Madam speaker died from a total
of.
Thank you for that.
We do not have pleaded not we do
not have to spend what is
distributed.
We do though we spend every dime
this distributed by the land
grant permanent fund but we
don't have to the court to real
clear on this issue that we are
the appropriators the
distribution is your mark a
legal commitment to that
beneficiary institution so that
was the main argument like for
five years ago that you know you
can't do this one percent cap
put a hundred fifty million
dollars into a system overnight
well now we're looking at a
hundred twenty million and and
we don't want to put a hundred
twenty million dollars into this
system in one fiscal year we can
do it incrementally so for
example if we spend forty
million the first year then the
eighty million that we don't
spend remains in the investment
account collecting interest
earmarked for early education so
so that.
That bank accounts so to speak
that investment account for
early education will continue to
grow as we build out the system.
and so to answer your question
it remains an investment account
collecting interest earmarked
for early education.
Thank you John and then as we go
and I guess I just have one last
question Madam speaker and
gentleman so if this is an act
I'm sure I'll soon with the
additional funds be available I
guess two at two local
districts.
Madam speaker jollity formal
auto a July first twenty twenty
three.
So the election will be in
November of twenty twenty two
assuming the voters approve it
then we'll have access to the
funds when we start our
legislative session in January
of twenty twenty three for the
for the fiscal year beginning
July first twenty twenty three
so it's a ways off.
but
But it'll certainly be
You know we're certainly looking
forward to it.
All right thank you John for
answer my questions and madam
speaker I don't.
There's further debate the
gentleman from Chavis Lee Ann
Roosevelt Representative leader
Anderson.
Okay let's go on to the
representative from anti
Representative Brown.
Thank you very much our next
speaker will the gentleman from
Bernalillo please yield.
Madam speaker I yield to the
gentle lady from any.
I appreciate that very much
thank you are madam speaker and
gentle and so.
I recall in previous years
efforts were made to
get money out of the land I
think was the land grant
permanent fund for
early education
Madam speaker gentleman this
resolution targets the permanent
school fund.
So I think there's a little bit
of confusion we we do have a
number of funds and state
governments and sometimes it's
hard to keep them all separate
but the question I'd like to
start with gentleman madam
speaker is.
I just to get some clarification
about the funds were talking
about find out if there is a in
any way connection between or
among several funds so looking
at article twelve of our state
constitution and it deals with
education.
And section two of that talks
about the permanent school fund.
And the source of the funds for
for that permanent school fund
is.
Are proceeds of sales of
sections two sixteen thirty two
and thirty six in each township
of the State.
Gentleman from Bernalillo madam
speaker so is is that if I were
to laser focus on where the
funding is supposed to come
under this resolution is that
the fund.
Madam speaker gentle lady from
ready that is not the funded but
those are the tracts of land
that that derive that create the
fund that create the the money
that goes into the fund so that
is an act of.
You know the congressional actor
and then the neighboring act
talked about a great job of land
going to these particular
institutional beneficiaries.
Our constitution of tracks that
language somewhat and then in
statute it actually did actually
talks about which sections in
which tracks of land essentially
not be long but but are legally
attached to these beneficiaries
and so from that State Land
because right because my group
it'll government didn't didn't
want you know.
Some for states to need all this
financial money all the time I
wanted the state to grow its own
economy its own educational
system it's on governmental
institutions.
nine million acres was was no.
Given so to speak from the US
government to the state
government we have nine million
Acres of land we have thirteen
million mineral rights are a
great grades with mineral rights
underneath that and from that
land.
We can do whatever we want with
that we can cut the timber and
sell it we could grace because
we can sell the land or we can
allow or are we can lease the
land oil companies to make money
the money that goes into the
land grant permanent fund.
It marks for that beneficiary
that our taxes to that section
of line.
Thank you gentlemen I appreciate
the explanation Madam speaker
and gentleman so yes the the
source of these funds is from
those particular tracts of land
and it is captioned the
permanent school fund so I guess
what I'm asking again is is this
the fund that we're really
talking about the permanent
school fund.
Madam speaker from up.
From any yes yes the proposal
that we voted on one percent
that left the house was for the
entire.
Permanent one that every single
beneficiaries would increase its
distribution R. one percent the
Senate however kept the other
twenty beneficiaries the same.
And only increase the
distribution for the beneficiary
or the money goes into the
permanent school fund so the
land grant permanent fund
essentially is twenty one funds
the permanent school fund is the
fund that allocates to the
common schools.
and so so the common schools
which makes up eighty six
percent of the land grant
permanent fund.
Will increase its distribution
or the general fund one and one
quarter.
With the sixty percent going
early at forty percent going to
K. to twelfth so the fund that
we're actually asking the voters
to increase the distribution is
the permanent school fund.
Very good thank you Madam
speaker and gentleman so is it
correct to say that the
permanent school fund is the
largest component of the land
grant permanent fund.
Madam speaker jelly from it yes
it makes up eighty six percent
of the land a permanent.
Thank you I appreciate that
Madam speaker gentle and so next
question in our state
constitution that's article
eight section and we see the
severance tax permanent fund
Madam speaker gentleman could
you explain what that is in
comparison to the permanent
school fund.
Thank you Mr gently Committee so
this reading it now.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady from right so this is
another fund.
That's the and and and it's kind
of fight in our constitution and
section ten from article eight
as you mentioned seven tax
funded fund that's the fun that
we fund capital projects.
So money derived from
from the the severance tax the
the the the minerals that are
separate from the that that
taxes off of that going to the
severance tax permanent fund
that frontier is managed by the
state investment council as well
collecting interest and we are
take a portion of that fund
every year to fund up capital
capital improvement projects or
public works projects so it's
similar but different it does
not have a beneficiary but it
has a a a a purpose which is
public works projects.
Thank you German thank you so
much Madam speaker German.
So it's.
For the for the benefit of
someone like me so I can
understand the Senate amendments
So the land grant permanent fund
and the severance tax permanent
fund are different funds is that
correct speaker gentle H.
somebody correct distinct
separate funds for different
purposes.
Thank you so much so so I'm
getting back to my original
question I was asking in
previous attempts are to to do
what this bill is attempting to
do what is the language used to
I don't remember hearing
permanent school fund mention.
A gentleman can you are directly
on that.
Thank you madam speaker gently
from from from at eight you're
correct all of the all of the
resolutions that Representative
Martinez of myself and and now
and then Representative us W.
W. Garcia Richard and others
Representative Thomson
Representative Lewis all of the
resolutions that we put forward
was an increase of all the
beneficiaries would distinguish
between the beneficiaries so we
are proposing an increase of one
percent from the land grant
permanent fund and I remember
one one time debate.
Someone said well you're not
going to get one percent you're
only gonna get one percent of
eighty six percent and all that
good stuff so so yeah we've
always point four one percent
for all beneficiaries because
frankly we wanted to Mexico
militaries to school for the
deaf school for the blind you
know they could use a few more
dollars
it's it was never contemplated
on the house side to only raise
the distribution.
For the common schools portion
of the funds but the Senate.
I felt that that was a good idea
So yeah we're only gonna go to
the voters us to increase the
distribution of the permanent
school fund.
Madam speaker and gentleman so I
I think that was indeed one of
the issues in previous years and
I know that Sanchez of those
previous representative
resolutions were really
disappointed when they didn't
get there are resolutions
through.
But in fact this is a better
approach and so sometimes our
disappointment turns out to be a
blessing in disguise because I
think you were going to ask
voters to approve this they're
going to want to know that
there's a strong nexus between
this particular permanent school
fund and funding education
which is schools so I think.
Are we know that the
The title of this resolution is
what will go on the ballot so
it's all the voters will have to
go by so let me just take a
minute
Madam speaker and gentleman and
talk a little bit about the bill
tied with how I think
and you know the Senate made
some changes to it so I just
want to kind of determine if
these changes are for the better
and if it will help voters to
understand more clearly.
So I'm Madam speaker and
gentleman that it says a joint
resolution proposing amendments
to article twelve section seven.
Of the constitution of New
Mexico.
To provide an additional annual
distribution provides for excuse
me additional annual
distributions of the permanent
school fund.
For enhanced instruction for
students.
At risk of failure comma
extending the school year.
What
our teacher compensation and
early childhood education and
then I this is so Michael and
after that requiring
congressional.
Approval for distributions for
early childhood education.
Madam speaker and gentleman so.
I'd like to take a little bit
closer look at that that series
of elements it says that the
first one that and distributions
will be for enhanced instruction
for students at risk of failure.
I think the Senate made a good
change there as well
Madam speaker and gentleman
because I think everybody's
going to agree that we want
students who are at risk of
failure getting some additional
help of funding to help them.
The next part talks about
extending the school year.
And.
I'm not sure I know what that
means I'm not sure it's not real
parents from from the title of
the resolution
that may or may not help
the voters decide is that and
perhaps looking at year round
school and madam speaker
gentleman's you know.
A MasterCard generated already I
don't know I think
I think because it's a new
budget item somewhat I think you
could justify utilizing our a
permanent school fund allocation
but I'm not sure what the.
To me that stuff should be in
statute but it right up but I
think.
Folks want to know where the
money's going folks were
frustrated that that are
resolution didn't have any
specifics.
As representatives I believe it
should be in statute not of the
constitution but the US senators
you know I the Senators felt it
best to to at least give an
outline of where the money
should be going within the K.
through twelve system.
Eight speaker and gentleman so I
I agree that we don't want to
put too much into a resolution
for one thing the ballots are
fairly long as it is but I think
this this wording by the Senate
might
I'm just really not help people
understand what what could
happen here maybe it's adding a
few days to the school year a
few hours to each day perhaps
it's it's a little bit I decide
so that that may not be either
may help or hurt but I know that
there are a lot of parents to
what object to year round school
lots of places in the world have
year round school but it's
really not been an American
thing.
So maybe this language is yes
vague is is going to be helpful
we'll see our Madam speaker and
and Joanne from Bernalillo and
then it talks about that part of
the well it says that
distributions from the permanent
school fund would be used for
NSS Act teacher compensation.
Madam speaker and gentlemen so
that clearly indicates some kind
of pay raise I would take it for
for teachers.
Madam speaker dollars already
not necessarily raises but that
money would be earmarked for a.
Teacher salaries and benefits.
Yes thank you our general from
Bernalillo and madam speaker so
I kind of have that going around
to the back of my mind when I
think of teacher compensation I
thought that could include
perhaps
Help with tuition to get
additional education for the
teachers themselves to help them
be better teachers.
Could certainly involved budget
the work compensation I guess
could compass a number of
things.
So thank you and then for early
childhood education again this
this really I think are just ten
things down better than the
other resolutions we've had in
the past I believe madam speaker
gentleman's.
What we heard in the past was
just more money for early
childhood education or education
services so the Senate has done
a better job
of getting information here.
So I'm.
Next I'd like to go to a little
bit of a discussion Madam
speaker and gentleman about inst
many places in the resolution to
work fund has been stricken.
And replaced with our land grant
permanent funds rural when that
happens I haven't counted but
maybe.
Eight ten times in the bill.
The gentleman could you explain
as speaker why that particular
change how is that better.
Already so currently under that
section of the constitution Fund
refers to lack government funds.
But because they they drew a
distinction on the distribution
they changed the words fund to a
land grant permanent funds or I
believe in one or two instances
it's the permanent school fund.
So they distinguished are are we
hope to distinguish in the
constitution and the law the
distinction between what we're
talking about the letter
permanent funds with the.
With the original beneficiaries
and the permanent school fund
with this new beneficiaries
early childhood education.
Thank you general appreciate the
answer I I think it's more
descriptive one thing especially
if people are familiar and that
most people probably aren't
familiar with the funds that we
have in state government and
that for them this
this change may be a little bit
perplexing but I think it does
question out so I I see it as a
good change on our part of the
Senate.
Madam speaker and gentlemen so
next looking at
there's a reference here it's
not in the original a text in
our constitution but I'm looking
at page three of the resolution
up it starting at line two.
And here
After the Senate amendments have
been put on the the operative
sentences.
The annual distribution from the
land grant permanent funds to
the beneficiary's specified in
the purpose and act in the
enabling act shall be five
percent of the average of the
year and values.
Of the permanent funds for the
immediately preceding five
calendar years so.
Madam speaker and gentlemen so
here we have now a reference to
the purpose and act in the
enabling act.
I guess my question is do you
think that the voters are going
to you know they'll have the the
title of the bill basically to
work with that do you think
anybody else is going to know
what this really means.
For many not not very many of I
think the voters will simply ask
themselves.
We want to increase.
Take more money out of this fund
for education for kids in New
Mexico but I don't think the
average Joel or even the average
provided five ten years ago knew
about that.
Representative enabling act as
well as we do now sorry I don't
think the average Joe voter will
we'll know what those two acts
are.
I would agree with that
gentleman and then speaker I
think maybe even some of the
institution has the ones that
benefit from these this language
you may not even know but I
appreciate it to me it's a
little bit of our history and
people can you know what the
cell phones and yes computers
people can Google anything and
get an answer almost
instantaneously so but I like
seeing language in there so
credit to the Senate.
I want next look at this is a
pretty typical part of the
resolution Madam speaker John
but it's it's on the same page
page three.
And it's our paragraph G.
starting at one six.
And this is really you know very
little it's in addition to the
annual distributions made
pursuant to section we just
talked about section asked.
and then I'll skip a little and
this is the annual distribution
of one one four percent.
At the average of the year and
market value of the permanent
school fund for the immediately
preceding five calendar years
and this will be our basically
the distribution so.
What I'd like to say about this
Madam speaker and gentleman is I
like the idea of the road side
five year average we see that
pattern used in other parts of
some of our other statutes and
what it what it really does is
provide a little bit of
not going to hire too low when
we average for five years gives
us a better a better number to
go by so I think the Senate did
well in that as well I'm talking
a little bit about the one and
that quarter percent.
Gentleman Madam speaker could
you
And if this was addressed
earlier I apologize I might have
missed it why did we settle on
one point two five percent one
and a quarter percent for the
distribution.
Find a great question great
question I wasn't privy to the
Senate conversations we
literally didn't know what was
coming our way.
Tell
Tobin hearing in which was the
amendments were we're going to
be disclosed and of course it
got postponed a couple of days
so we had a couple days heads up
it was multiple amendments are
drafted one was to to divide up
the one percent sixty forty.
I was hoping for an amendment of
one percent point five percent I
believe the fund can handle six
point five but the
I think the Senators respected
the importance and the arguments
with our started childhood.
Educational investments but the
Senate felt very strongly that
our K. through twelve should
benefit as well and so on the
Senators they worked out that
compromise of point seventy five
for early and point five for K.
through twelve totaling.
One in four.
Thank you gentleman have
speaker.
so.
Also going to commend the Senate
for the change your work on they
they struck language about ten
billion dollars being you know
everybody read it it's it's very
short
and here's you know this one and
a quarter percent distribution
what will be made provided that.
The additional distribution
shall not be made in any fiscal
year if the average of the year
and market values of the land
grant permanent funds for the
immediately preceding five
calendar years yes less than and
they struck the words ten
million dollars and put in
seventeen million dollars.
So my question Madam speaker
gentleman this kind of along the
same line how did you how do you
think the Senate arrived at
seventeen million dollars is
basically before.
And one of the things I was
really wondering about gentleman
no speakers yes you were present
for the hearing and Senate
finance when these amendments
were put on and I think I just
heard you say that you found out
after the fact but do you happen
to know gentleman R. Y.
seventeen million dollars thank
you Mr Jinapor ready.
Well not after the fact I would
I presented the bill in the
Senate finance but we didn't
know what a members were coming
our way till till just before
the hearing.
But I don't know the thought
process but my best guess is
because the five year rolling
average that we just voted out
of hospital to.
Is is between seventeen and
eighteen billion dollars so in
other words if if the five year
rolling average goes lower than
what it is today then the one
one and a quarter distribution
will cease.
I believe that's why they chose
seventeen did.
Madam speaker German so it does
appear to be more protective of
the funding keeping the corpus
at a at a better level than
otherwise would be the case so
again I I approved what the
Senate did there I think it's
it's better.
Madam speaker gentleman's so I'd
like to talk a little bit about
few other paragraphs in the bill
that because other people I
think still wish to speak out
okay just a little bit short
Appreciate very much the Senate
work here the NM that's I'm not
sure that I can support
resolution though simply because
I think there's you know we talk
about pretty financial
management.
And we know if there's a kind of
a rule in finance that you don't
take out more than sports
certainly probably no more than
five percent.
of the interest from a fund and
and we know the reason for that
we want to protect the corpus
because that's what funds.
In this case education for
children into the future.
And I have qualms about.
Taking things away from the
school children of the future I
feel I have a fiduciary duty to
watch out for their welfare.
And I just think that we may be
benefiting something's some
children now some programs
things like that but down the
road we'll have.
The court to the staff has been
reduced because we've done more
than the pretty financial person
would do so.
I'm leaning against supporting a
resolution although I look
forward to.
Mr speaker and gentleman the
intent of this resolution.
And again the three things that
are mentioned here.
That would benefit or
Helping students at risk of
failure we've got to do that in
some way and I think we're
already doing that in a lot of
what we're already doing in our
budget.
We talk about extending the
school year and I think we're
all thinking that's really a
good idea in light of the euro.
Lost learning that most students
experience said because of the
shut downs of our schools since
March of twenty twenty.
And then I would like to see
teachers getting better
compensated I think they have
are a tough job and they so many
of them do it so incredibly well
and I think we should always
reward good performance so.
When I want to thank you for
entertaining my questions madam
speaker thank you for giving me
the opportunity to speak.
And without some again my thanks
are you.
There's further debate the
gentleman from Chavis the
Roosevelt Representative leader
Anderson thank you madam speaker
Madam speaker of.
Gentleman from Bernalillo yield.
Madam speaker I yield as soon as
I find the gentleman from Chavis
the Roosevelt on the map.
On the seating chart yes thank
you.
Thank you thank you
Randall lot.
This bill would have passed the
house sit forty eight to twenty
two and I listen to the Senate
amendments and I to struggling
with whether or not I like it
yes I jotted down some notes and
I'll try to be quick because I
know we're we're running short
of time I listen to
I'm here tonight very happy that
our students will be back in
school finally next month are
you have questions or funding
we're not getting our money's
worth this by more things and I
think you know.
I'm not sure that.
Committee necessarily wins me so
I did want to of identify a
couple of points.
As did I understand you
correctly that there twenty one
beneficiaries and only one
beneficiary will be paying.
Paying out of their corpus this
one and a quarter percent
question.
Madam speaker gentleman from the
Roosevelt and Travis you are
correct only the common schools.
Share our will will receive.
And will will give up this
distribution thank you very much
because I've I wanted to just
confirm that I heard that
correctly because that is
important.
then I I listen to the the
comment about.
There was a comment made and in
the committee gentleman Madam
speaker about of the revenues
that that has created this
twenty two billion dollar of.
Fund and I think to myself I
wonder how much number put in
and I wonder how much Gration
Padilla and I wonder how much
oil and gas is put in if you
made any gas gentleman
It is a lot to a little or did
can be put in a whole lot early
on and oil and gas is not put in
much how would you break that
down just of curious about his
which which which industry in
New Mexico has built there's
twenty two billion dollar of of
the fund question Madam speaker
John from Travis Lee was what
what what a great question I
think I.
Just drop a letter to the land
commissioner Garcia Richard in
my mind that is a great question
early on it was timber and sales
it was timber grazing and land
sales.
the best argument of this whole
endeavor is that the land grant
permanent fund was created in
the event that oil dried up well
well wasn't and discovered in
New Mexico till.
Seventeen years after the fund
was created so what after oil
and gas was discovered or crude
oil rather and in nineteen
twenty seven.
Then that drilling started in
the state of Mexico I would
imagine in the eighties it was
natural gas but certainly the
last twenty years it's been true
real crude oil drilling and the
leases from the major oil
companies so I would imagine the
vast majority of the inflows
into the fund are from crude oil
but the vast majority of the
growth of the funds.
Is from is from the stock
market.
Thank you gentlemen and I'm I
like you were pleased to hear
that of our investment has
been wisely manage of.
On that my question was what you
were talking to the state land
commissioner of securities what
portion of the seven the let's
see what portion of the twenty
two million has been resulted
from the renewable energy
revenues.
Thank you madam speaker
gentleman from our job is the
result I would imagine not very
much because that's a very very
new with Connie very very new
economy but I know some
The current commissioners signed
some pretty strong leases in the
past couple years And excelling
to grow in the future but I
would imagine.
Thanks very very insignificant
amount about historically okay
thank you gentlemen in in my my
conclusion is is we better be
looking for another forces we're
sure working hard on turning out
the Haidar carbon from from
further revenue contributions
into that fund with some of the
recent public policy decisions
we may gentleman my next
question is you mentioned in
your commentary about
Harvard.
Has has of Senator has a large
endowment fund and and they keep
theirs at four percent and I
believe you said because no oil
and gas.
Session it's all purely
financials and I thought okay no
that's an interesting concept
gentleman Madam speaker because
it suggests that if you've just
been financials you get four
percent but if you can help oil
and gas and financials you get a
much higher rate of return could
you comment on that gentleman.
Thank you madam speaker
gentle from Travis Lee Roosevelt
that is my number one argument
that are fun can handle the
increased increased distribution
cause us to sources of revenue.
Strong sources of revenue what
is a the ability to invest in
nationally and internationally
with no of fifty percent cap on
foreign investments we took that
cap away in the two thousand
fourteen constitutional
amendment was passed by the
voters so it is a massive
portfolio with massive
opportunities to move financial
capital across international
borders at literally the push of
a button.
And we have the money and cash
flowing into the fund monthly
derived from from royalties
acquired by the State Land
Office so so the gentleman of
miss madam speaker gentleman
from Chavis was all the as the
as my colleague of the classical
seven UT Austin grad mentioned
that will those funds have big
time donations things like that
they don't have anything there
that second.
form of income like of like our
frontier does from the State
Land Office and that's why we
can go
We can handle the the one and a
quarter additional distribution.
Thank you gentlemen for that
response Madam speaker
earlier in the committee this
evening I heard of a COVID that
is something if I summarized the
gentleman and I don't want to
put words in your mouth so
please correct me if I don't but
it was sort of like well the if
the voters vote for this
the benefit comes without
raising a dime in taxes.
I was hoping for a little
clarification on that because it
did strike me gentleman that.
Free lunch
certainly somewhere somehow.
Somebody is going to have to pay
for this additional money of
flowing to up a program for two
public school education in New
Mexico could you comment on that
please Sir thank you thank you
madam speaker John from the
rules of all Chavis no I just a
great a great conversation.
The money New Mexico has a
billion dollar companies
enterprise called called the
State Land Office.
All New Mexicans own.
collectively the the royalties
from the land the mineral rights
underneath the land were all oil
barons here in New Mexico and
our future generation
owns that oil.
So
So you're so my point in not
raising a dime in taxes the
money from the land grant
permanent fund.
It is can be allocated in time
be spent without raising a dime
in taxes but when you're talking
about I think it's like wait a
second because we're taking this
money out now our distribution
is going to be as high as it
would be down the rules how we
gonna make up for that and
that's those that's the fear I
think of one is I think people
trying to respond to hedge
against future future future
taxes and also it it the way was
going so dramatically through
the oil price crash that it it
just helped out the state
coffers tremendously so we kind
of lost sight of our ability to
invest the fund even better that
we're investing it today but I
don't believe will have to raise
taxes I just think our economy
will grow our economy will grow
when we have a healthier human
beings going through the
educational system not going
through the juvenile and adult
criminal justice system and
getting better jobs and having
higher annual incomes throughout
the course of their lives and
folks wanting to stay in New
Mexico and moved to New Mexico
because we have a thriving
bustling economy with less crime
and less of social social ills
so I think the offset so to
speak the offset to the general
fund that we may that we may not
get the benefit of you know
thirty fifty years down the road
we'll we'll be offset
tremendously in fact the
professor Heckman from your
arses Chicago school of
economics suggests that the
state coffers will be offset
three to one for every dollar we
spend will get three dollars
back and the overall health of
the economy will grow also the
government will get seven to one
return the overall economy will
get three to one return on this
investment of early childhood
education.
Thank you gentlemen I hope that.
Gentleman madam speaker that
you're you're protection.
Is true of because it's
certainly of CGS a very
promising future should this up
constitutional amendment be
adopted.
I would simply say that that New
Mexico's bounty on the oil and
gas is not derive simply for
what she involved is that
actually there are a series of
oil and gas taxes that also are
woven into that a twenty two
billion dollars but I'm not
going to dwell on that any more
except to say noticeably absent
in the future yes renewable in
energy's contribution to of this
fund going forward and I'm gonna
leave it at that because of
that's another day gentleman my
last comment has to do with a
real concern I have when I read
the Senate amendment.
In terms of the title.
And it's very clear to me that I
in other New Mexican voters on
the first of November and two
thousand twenty two we'll be
looking at the ballots of
perhaps a crowded one.
And it says requiring
congressional approval.
And.
Committee suggestions will will
will will will pass this on
November first and by Christmas
or new year's what will have
that approval and I just want
Madam speaker I think to myself
where is this person.
Who ever said Congress would.
Hey in six weeks so I am very
curious gentleman this evening
about how you see that approval
process looking forward should
this constitutional amendment
passed and specifically what
does Congress approved and they
look at and on record educating
our children they look it and
how many failed I heard the
committee that half of them are
failing right now I just think
we do we go on this whole
congressional approval process
and I am very interested in your
response gentleman madam
speaker.
Madam speaker John from Travis
Lee Roosevelt's
My description of how it's going
to happen is that's my story and
I'm sticking to it.
But but but the question will be
a question of sovereignty a
question of states rights a
question of self determination.
I think a lot of us senators and
congresspeople back used to be
like wait what you have to ask
Congress how to spend your own
money.
you know this the states the
states that
They wanted to free themselves
from the voting rights act of
nineteen sixty five actually won
in court they won in the Supreme
Court because the Supreme Court
said well the voting stats from
forty years ago aren't relevant
today.
I believe that that's kind of
the philosophy now is that
Congress in eighteen ninety
eight should not dictate what we
as a we democratic society
should do and twenty twenty
three.
So it might be procured of some
of the Representative session
back east the folks out west I
understand it because they're in
the same boat every western
state has enabling acts although
not as restrictive as ours and
so I don't think
You know you never know one
Senator might raise a fuss and
might do this or that but I
think that for the most part
everyone's going to agree that
this is a states rights issue
this is a question of us of of
sovereignty self determination
and and so it'll be another
victory on the road to.
To this coming to fruition you
are to have that consent of
Congress I do not believe and
I'll say it for the last time in
a.
Hopefully not set.
But I price it another hundred
times I don't believe it belongs
in in the in the language of the
of the resolution.
Going to Congress is is what we
need to do we don't need to lock
it into the resolution but the
Senate felt compelled to to not.
Fund shackle us from that
requirement and open the four
corners of the resolution.
Thank you gentlemen.
Madam speaker I.
I worry because we can't ask you
when we get to going to Congress
and getting approval what ever
that may need in whatever amount
of time that may take it seems
to me that they're going to be
legal fees associated with that
and I was just curious because I
think of legal Council even that
city is very expensive I was
curious as you see it see it
today if somebody said well we
passed the amendment now we
gotta go get Congress's approval
and somebody says well we need a
law firm to help us who's going
to pay those legal fees
gentleman Madam speaker.
Madam speaker John from Travis
the Rose Bowl nobody because we
don't need legal fees were not
going to court
are you a social cheaper our
senior rather nicely Center one
hundred has a staff they have a
Legislative Council drops their
bills just like we have a
Legislative Council that jobs
are built and they and their
stopped up with with lawyers as
well so that congressional
Legislative Council and what
it's called would a drop the
legislation I believe it's
already dropped it and then it
would be introduced and passed
are just like any other bill.
Thank you thank you gentlemen so
this approval is going to
require a congressional act in
the form of the bill being
passed by the house and the
Senate and signed by the
president did I understand that
correctly gentleman.
I don't so much obviously will
go I don't believe it'll be a
presidential
Signature but definitely the
consent of Congress but I but I
just legal counsel here is not a
that that the president gets to
sign and join in the celebration
as well all of you might might I
Lois give me some bad bad
signals so we do not need a
presidential signature we merely
need a consent of Congress okay
gentleman from Chavis Lee and
Roosevelt we have passed that
three hour limit we will now go
on to that generated some done
manner thank you thank you madam
speaker.
Thank you madam speaker this
matter being having been debated
for three hours I move debate

Okay we're moving on to these
for moving on with the
concurrence.
I.
That gentleman from Bernalillo
Sandoval Representative Ely.
Thank you madam speaker I move
that the house floor with the
sentiments that house bill
seventy five and I urge the
house yes.
The gentleman to explain the
amendments Madam speaker members
of the body this is really a
remarkable achievement.
This was the result of hours
days weeks of negotiations
between patients hospital.
Our hospitals hospitals so
ciation Medical Society nurses
trial lawyers even the Senate be
in the Senate senior citizens
Law Center I gave their stamp of
approval to us
the fact is is this a compromise
where everybody's a little bit
on a happy.
It is excellent and surprising
and the best of the legislature
can do is bring parties together
that have different interests
and get them to compromise in a
way that serves the public good.
The key components of a
compromise amendment.
Adopted by the Senate Judiciary
and then also adopted on the
Senate floor thirty six so I.
Include.
That the cap on uh damages
against individual physicians
has now been raised from six
hundred thousand to seven
hundred fifty thousand with a
call up so that we don't
constantly revisit that cap.
It expanded the definition of
health care practitioners to
allow them to participate in the
patient's compensation fund
include certified nurse
practitioners clinical nurse
specialist certified nurse
midwives midwives with a similar
limit cap on damages.
The hospitals are going to set
up in a fact their own insurance
funded they will still be under
the medical malpractice act
there are caps will be
different.
The structure of their
relationship with the medical
malpractice act will be
different.
Start the capitol started four
million dollars increase five
hundred thousand dollars each
year until twenty twenty six
putting the maximum limit of six
million also with the Cola.
Future medical expenses will be
paid to harm patients and one
some rather than continuing the
current system of having to seek
payment from the office of
superintendent of insurance it
provides transparency by
designating a third party to
oversee the patient's
compensation fund assessed
proprioception are just in the
positions nurses and hospitals
to choose to participate in the
act.
I'm proud of this body and I'm
proud of the legislature for
having brought these parties
together and with that madam
speaker right urge the house to
vote yes or sentiment thank you
madam speaker there is debate
the gentleman from we
Representative Pettigrew.
Thank you madam chair Madam
speaker
does representatives from
Bernalillo and Sandoval yield.
Madam speaker I will yield to
the gentleman from way.
Thank you.
Number.
Madam chair and don't let them
believe we debated this and.
And how C. path the as I read it
now it's.
Change substantial and as you
just applied unfortunately
Madam speaker madam chair Madam
speaker and gentleman.
I'm not sure that I understand
all the changes and and you did
go through your introduction
world to liquid madam speaker
and so.
As we go through this and see
madam speaker the the Senate
come to meet me here redefine
the for our what part of this.
At eighteen.
Well we're gonna modernize
medical malpractice.
We're going to raise personal
liability.
Recovery caps.
Participation.
The hospitals in our outpatient
health care facilities.
Require a third party
administrator.
For the patients fund and
require annual fund audits done
by re board.
The natural world anyway that
work study and required to serve
are surcharged.
Sufficient to bring the fund to
solvency so madam speaker and
gentleman.
I hope to be able to go through
this.
Item by item and and understand
exactly the depth of each one of
those.
And
Madam chair and and gentleman.
As I understand on the.
From page one of the amendment.
Our new language as an advisory
board provides a definition for
that.
To provide funding adds your
fund and and.
Find the patient compensation
fund I think what are on of the
bill will get further into.
But the first major change.
Madam chair our madam speaker
and gentleman.
Is we have hospitals back in
from the original bill.
And then we.
The significant number number of
other people.
In person to provide this health
care care providers.
Madam chair gentleman can you
explain to me why.
What the intent of the
substitute for the amendment was
for doing this.
Madam speaker and gentleman so
let's be clear what this is this
is not the Senate Judiciary or
the Senate in fact the job was
going in the Senate Judiciary
that I contacted many of members
and I said please I'm asking you
don't amend this we have the
amendment keep it the way it is
the job was that I was no
amendment the line.
Because this is a deal worked
out by the parties in New Mexico
read a Billy contentious
litigious field every word
match every word can change
these parties pour over every
word in fact by the time we got
to the Senate floor there were
three words that were missing
from the draft we had to we do
the amendment on the Senate
floor to add those three words
so the parties were incredibly
durable.
So madam speaker and gentleman
from Lee as we're talking about
this I want the gentleman
understand this isn't coming
from a bunch of legislators this
is coming from hospitals from
the doctors from the lawyers
from their representatives from
the patients advocates that sat
down through hours of
negotiations this ammendment
representative A. D. R. that's
what this is and so madam
speaker and gentleman as you're
asking questions I want to
understand what they're doing.
They're trying to put people
that want to be under the
protection of the act in the act
so for example nurses are now in
the act that does a couple
things that satisfies the nurses
because madam speaker gentleman
you may remember there was a
bill in the Senate I wanted to
add nurses to the act so we
included them and that helps
chair of the fund because
there's now more providers
within the fund.
Madam speaker and gentleman
you'll also remember that one of
the great problems of the fund.
Was that once they started
letting in the hospitals one
started to run a deficit.
And it started climbing climb as
the number of hospitals ready
and to where by the time we got
to the floor it was about fifty
six million dollars in terms the
estimates that we're done so the
idea of this act of this man and
this bill if it gets out of this
chamber and to the governor.
Is the hospitals are going to
take five years.
Basically short help shore up
along with the doctors actuarial
John and on annual basis with
this advisory board to short the
fund and the hospitals will set
up in affect their own insurance
company with their own caps but
still under many of the
protections of the medical
malpractice act so that's why
the definitions have changed
they've changed both to include
other health care providers to
add that patients advisory board
which you'll see in section
fourteen described thirteen and
fourteen describe said to help
administer the fund shore up the
fund make sure the fund doesn't
have a deficit so that nobody
gets stock because one of the
other problems course that
doctors ended up paying more
more the premium independent
positions to where over the last
five years their premiums have
gone up forty nine percent.
So this was an attempt to put
more people on the frontier and
refine the definition of who's
in this act this new medical
malpractice act as a practical
matter hasn't seen this kind of
revision since its inception
forty five years.
Madam speaker John I hope that
answers your question.
Gentleman that does and and and
you probably answer some other
questions of that I'm gonna ask
you again later on and I hope
your patient with me was
respects that.
As as as we talked earlier madam
speaker and gentleman we debated
this.
Pretty well and C. pack and and
you were madam chair at the time
Pretty adamant about where we
work what the intent of this
bill was and I feel like the
intent.
Kind of gives madam chair and
what you.
What you wanted in the beginning
piece of this legislation.
But as we go through it maybe I
can just get the clarity and
hopefully madam chair and and
gentleman
For the people that are
listening them tonight they get
the clarity and they understand
the nuances.
Of.
How we got to a bill in this
format.
Not so much the old format
because we're dealing with this
one specifically this way.
But we get to that point and
madam chair and gentleman how we
got to the point where the
providers
out there became an agreement
with us and so.
Madam chair and gentleman please
give me some some patients with
respect just going through this
piece by piece.
Gentleman
On page three we define
occurrence.
Madam chair gentleman.
If I understand the way the
occurrences to provide this is
an all inclusive definition.
But with respect to that I do
have a question.
And I think madam chair
gentleman a janitor at an answer
part of my question later on
we'll talk about again.
In the bill but.
I'm gonna give an example madam
chair of the net so that.
And
I'd like to get an understanding
is this madam chair would be one
occurrence for Perkins this
potentially madam chair could be
a multiple turns.
In this case we have a person
that's that's brought in to.
the operating room.
And we have a.
There is a situation occurs on
the table.
And.
The the following Representative
litigation that goes through.
The M. R. C. which we'll talk
about later on in the bill up
madam chair.
This.
Applications submitted has
identifies the nurse.
Identifies the anesthesiologist.
And identify as the doctor flash
surgeon.
Madam chair and gentleman.
In that situation would as
defined on page three item by
would that be one of encouraging
madam chair government could
that be a multiple turns step
will.
Madam speaker gentleman's it
would be one.
I'm sorry madam chair editor.
I'm sorry madam speaker
gentleman it would be one.
Once again I said madam chair
and I do apologize but Adam
Stricker
As I understand it madam speaker
the next section G..
The funds those facilities that
would be impacted by this this
are amendment and this bill
would that be correct.
Madam speaker gentleman's yes
that would be correct.
Thank you.
So well chair and madam speaker
and gentleman as we go on to
section two.
Which starts which is on page
three of the bill I believe
under qualifications.
Section eighty.
As the verbiage to be qualified
madam speaker a health care
provider shall.
And then it goes on to continue
With the new language.
Well the piece of that but that
doesn't change but I will bring
read it in anyway establishes
financial responsibility but
following proves what's the
superintendent.
And I guess this is the first
place madam speaker that I I
read the words superintendent
and nowhere else in the beer
bill madam speaker do I and do I
get a clarity on what's the
superintendent is Madam speaker
don't.
Madam speaker gentleman I think
he is also defined options for
gender insurance superintendent
in the patient's compensation
forms section
and and while we're on it let me
just say since I do I Madam
speaker and gentleman I.
Encouraging you to take your
time I figure will be heard the
three hours so I just as soon
explain it G. as we go through
it because I think it's fair to
be going to a channel line by
line you know you often have to
explain to people.
Someone could be a qualified
health care provider or not a
qualified health care provider
and yet the license good doctor
because in New Mexico the term
qualified health care provider
has a specific meaning related
to insurance not related to
competency so it gets confusing
so that language has not
changed.
So if you look at the language
on page three where talks about
to be qualified that that person
or entity then becomes a
qualified health care provider
did receiving some or all of the
benefits of the medical
malpractice act.
And the thing madam speaker and
gentleman that I would tell you
is there's two ways to think
about this there's the medical
malpractice act which is the act
that we're looking at with this
amendment that's being amended
to provide certain protections
so for example under the medical
malpractice act if you're suing
and I think the new languages
and independent health care
provider I want to look at the
language here.
One just a second yeah
independent provider as opposed
to a hospital.
You go before a medical legal
panel.
Composed of doctors lawyers are
working on a volunteer basis to
graduate when he of a claim or
not not blind so what happens is
somebody will go in front of
them.
And I I a lawyer and their
client and present the case and
summary fashion to this panel
and they decide both I and I
decide to the wrong word.
They they reach a consensus as
to whether the position has
fallen below the standard of
care and caused injuries or
damages to the patient.
If the person.
Wins or lose it is not binding
nor admissible in a subsequent
proceeding so one of you can
still go file the case even if
you wash to the panel.
But it's designed to advise the
patient if the patient loses for
the doctor the doctor reasons
Hey we got problems here kind of
slow people down for medication
well so sure was the problem
with letting the hospitals it
works when you have physicians.
Because your limited number of
claims and we talked about that
the three claims here that's a
lot for doctor but for hospitals
true claims is nothing I mean
are you you can have multiple
claims in a month against a
hospital what that did was it
crashed that panel they couldn't
have enough lawyers and doctors
volunteer to sit on it so when
you go through this what you
will see.
Is that the hospitals do not get
the advantage of a medical legal
panel because it simply doesn't
work but the independent
providers do and that restores
the system to the way it was
originally intended as a
practical matter since the
hospitals have been what led in
the medical legal panel has
really cease to be an effective
tool because it takes so long to
getting permissions are so far
behind because you're so many
claims so that's an example of
the medical malpractice act and
how it works that should be
separated from the patient's
compensation fund that is with
in the act but the patient's
compensation fund is literally
the fund that in nineteen
seventy six the legislature set
up not with taxpayer dollars but
with position dollars put into a
fund that patients could then
apply for that's the one that is
run a deficit so as you go
through this act would you will
see is you will see reference to
the medical malpractice act
who's in it what benefits they
get depending on they are what
their status is and the
patient's compensation fund and
the new system that's being set
up by the hospitals to insure
themselves as they get to if
they want to take advantage of
this fact not every hospital is
gonna go in this act in fact
today many hospitals in New
Mexico private hospitals are not
affording themselves of the
protections the medical
malpractice act doesn't make
sense for them financially for
whatever reason and remember
public hospitals are in no way
impacted by anything we're
talking about tonight.
Hospitals aren't entirely
different act all the New Mexico
tort claims act having nothing
to do with this so as we go
through it I just saw at
Johnson's we're gonna have a
three hour discussion I might as
well give you kind of an outline
of primer if you will on the
medical malpractice staff to the
patients compensation fund at
least to make it you know
moderately more interesting this
scintillating subjects thank you
madam speaker John.
Madam speaker and gentleman I do
appreciate that and I do
appreciate you making that easy
on a freshman record three our
conversation.
Madam speaker gentleman's I'm
happy to do it I really am
welcome to the legislature.
Thank you thank you very much.
So.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
And in this section section
section two eight a one.
We we increase.
The individual provider
deductible from two hundred to
two hundred fifty thousand
dollars is that correct.
You madam speaker gentleman yeah
that's correct.
So madam speaker and gentleman
can can you explain the process
behind that change the the how
that helps the independent
provider so in other words
what's happening is if you go
back to page three you will see
that one of the requirements to
get within the frontier is that
the qualified health care
provider which we talked about a
little bit file with the
superintendent of insurance that
the health care provider is you
sure by a malpractice policy
that covers up to all on and I'm
going to page four two hundred
fifty thousand dollars for you
know they have been deposit with
the superintendent in charge
seven hundred fifty thousand
dollars that's always been the
way it is with this act just
increase the amount to kind of
keep as they say keep up with
the value of the dollar so it's
not a significant change it is
part and parcel of the
malpractice act.
So madam speaker and gentleman
As I understand it.
That value comes from the
individuals insurance would that
be correct yeah madam speaker
that's why the it's the if you
if you go through that paragraph
you will see the individual
health care provider has to
provide either proof of
insurance of two hundred fifty
thousand or the seven hundred
fifty thousand dollar deposit as
distinguished from hospitals out
and outpatient health care
facilities that have to
establish financial
responsibility through
malpractice liability insurance
policy
provided that that's provided
further than for the independent
providers so it's something
separate the idea of being you
have underlying insurance and
then the fun kicks in what I I
and madam speaker gentleman just
so I'm clear with all of you I
do not do medical malpractice
let me just check make sure I've
given an accurate answer I have
my experts dot rave artists on
the phone who you may remember
also testified in committee and
currency packed as well as
Judiciary so if you give me just
a moment.
Madam speaker gentleman's I said
it correctly I'm not that's not
always going to be the case but
I think it was the gentleman
that.
I'm sorry Madam speaker at
understood the gentleman the
state needs to corrected.
Madam speaker by said that it
maybe the late hour
I am correct in what I told you
madam speaker gentleman but that
may not always be the case as
the night goes on I will not try
to break up constantly talking
to the expert I'm gonna try to
give you my best analysis and
once in a while I'm gonna want
to make sure by acts for that
I've Senate accurately to you
upon a little unsure.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman I I may have mis read
the sections I'm gonna ask for
in different pieces clarity as I
read this section madam speaker
and gentleman.
The two hundred to two hundred
fifty thousand dollar increase
was specific to the individual.
The seven hundred to seven
hundred and fifty.
increase was an increase in the
providers cap.
In my reading the section row.
Madam speaker John.
Madam speaker John and now it is
true ways over shoring the
administrator of the fund that
you're complying with the act so
you either can go out and
purchase an insurance policy.
In the value per current truck
two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars.
instrument on the floor or you
provide to the superintendent's
office on to deposit the sum of
seven hundred fifty thousand
dollars in cash and it says or
such other like depositors and
superintendent may allow by will
and you'll see that was in the
existing act the only thing
that's really been changed are
the a match not not the concept
of that underlying security that
the position is provided Madam
speaker gentleman I hope that
helps.
Speaker and gentleman that helps
a lot and and I I completely
miss read that section so I
appreciate that clarity
So.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
What is the difference do you
know where does your Madam
speaker is your expert witness
know what the cost differences
for.
Two hundred thousand dollar
deductible verses a two hundred
fifty thousand dollar deductible
for the individual provider and
what is the typical.
Taking that one step further
maybe what is the typical policy
that an individual provider
might have.
So madam speaker and gentleman
that's the beauty of this deal I
have no idea but the people that
would be financially affected by
this other ones that approves
the independent physician.
And and I have to tell you.
Madam speaker and gentleman the
nice thing about this kind of
line by line is I am certain.
That when you are finished with
your questioning there will be
no other questions from any of
your members because you will
have covered the Graham.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman.
Madam speaker and gentle and my
goal is to ask all the questions
up front so they can be taking
notes to go back and ask and do
other Madam speaker gentleman on
just getting around I I
appreciate that but I will try
to give you the answers that you
know as the questions come up
I'll try to give you thought the
lancers managed figure John.
And I do appreciate that very
much so in the next section.
It goes in and section be under
on page four section B. there's
a specific set of language
there.
That says determining based
coverage.
Or deposit and surcharge Madam
speaker and gentleman can you.
What me through exactly what
that means in in layman's Star
sure so sure sure and there's
and you're gonna look when you
see at the end of this accession
thirteen or fourteen you're
gonna see this is flushed out.
So what's happening is.
Member if you remember back to
C. pack madam speaker
gentleman's.
The funding is running into
trouble.
Because your work we believe.
Sufficient actuarial studies.
Competent ones with no claims
information what the little bit
what what plans were still open
how much of those fighting
settle for what were the
litigation costs associated with
those plans all of those things
that go into a good actuarial
study that's done repeatedly as
you'll see in this act on an
annual basis so that the
surcharge program to work for
premiums that are being charged
to independent physicians and
hospitals and nurses and
providers.
Adequately reflects the we ask.
Of having these people within
the fund.
And so that's why that
constantly needs to be
reevaluated and the terms that
you're referring to based
coverage deposit surcharges are
insurance charge and what is
designed to do is make sure that
when the hospitals leave the
patient's compensation but
remember they will be leaving
the medical malpractice act but
they'll be leaving the patients
compensation fund when they do
that the fund will be solvent
that's the goal.
And then from then on once the
hospitals work our average we
will go back to the period of
the prior to two thousand nine
when the hospitals were not part
of the patient's compensation
fund and at that moment in time
the patient's compensation one
was actually running a surplus
that's where we wanted to be so
I should go through this you're
gonna see these insurance terms
like base coverage deposits
surcharges that are really
designed to get to let's make
sure that work after early
charging people to cover the
rest for their being within the
far Madam speaker gentleman I
hope that answers your question.
Madam speaker and gentleman that
does and and very well I might
add and I appreciate that.
So as we move on and down in the
section I don't see.
The changes provided in this
says provided the beginning Jan
July first two thousand twenty
one hospital.
Outpatient health care
facilities.
I'm not participate in the
medical review process.
Madam speaker and gentleman I'm
assuming is it safe to assume.
That the medical review process
is what's discussed starting at
section seven later on in this
bill you and your member I think
that's right let me go to
section seven to make sure that
you have the right section.
Yes never I told you about the
medical we don't have them Madam
speaker and gentleman that's
what we're talking about the
fact that the hospitals in the
the entities that are gonna get
sued a lot more we don't want
them to going from the medical
review panel we just don't have
enough lawyers and doctors are
going to do it on a volunteer
basis to staff that night after
night after night so the system
returns to its original in
Chattfield which is really to
review independent positions and
our course nurses people that
are not going to get sued on a
regular basis that three claims
here would be extraordinary so
we want to get back to that so
the medical legal panel returns
to its original function which
is for independent physicians
nurses those kind of people and
not entities like hospitals and
outpatient health care
facilities.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman I appreciate that
answer.
So as we continue on into
section three.
And the limitations of recovery
piece of the slip legislation.
The first section Madam speaker
and gentleman Hey.
Is the date January first twenty
twenty two the limit the six
hundred thousand dollars based
on the active date of this act
or where they come from Madam
speaker and gentleman.
So couple of answers that
question madam speaker John the
six hundred thousand dollars is
set to.
inside with the date of this act
actually would take affect
January one twenty twenty two.
The other interesting thing that
you asked the guy that really is
part of that question is.
What are we talking about is
when does that apply and I and I
think as of this writing again
all Mr Vargas ensuring the.
If you were in a car accident.
You have an occurrence based
policy.
So in other words what that
means is if you have insurance
at the time of the accident
that's your insurance not later
right you can't get in an
accident dangle purchased
coverage and you're covered you
gotta be covered at the time
everybody understands that you
think every insurance policies
like that but for example for
legal malpractice claims
interestingly enough it's what's
called the claims made calls
it's not at the time that the
action occurred it's the time
you became aware of the claim so
that could be several years
later these are and I want to
make a hundred percent sure I'm
right these are the important
these are are encouraging based
coverage is under the act let me
make sure I've said that right
let me check with Mr marks.
Madam speaker gentleman on now
two for two I don't think I'll
be batting a hundred percent
tonight but so far so good.
Madam speaker and gentleman I
hope you had a hundred percent
of that
Madam speaker and gentleman as
we get to section B. and I'm not
gonna read the whole section in
here but there is one piece and
here.
That I'm confused about.
Two thirds of the way down and
set it specifically states madam
speaker and gentleman in jury
cases the jury shall not be
given any instructions dealing
with the seven hundred fifty
thousand dollar limitation Madam
speaker and gentleman can you
explain to me why we do that and
not a turning top the madam
speaker John it's the same
reason that you don't do it in
the typical auto accident case
the jury when they make an
assessment of damages will do it
independent of whatever your
insurance it so let's say that
your showing someone was a
twenty five thousand dollar
policy.
And you sue them and the jury
awards fifty thousand jury does
not know.
What your insurances.
So that when that when the jury
comes back the parties know but
the jury does not it's intended
to let the jury separately
decide what the damages award
but then the limitations set in
statute that is very common both
by statute and by common law for
different situations like I just
describe auto accidents so this
is nothing out of the order that
so jury will come back let's say
the award a million dollars on
the act at least for the
compensatory portion and we're
gonna get into different kinds
of damages but for the
compensatory portion of the case
with ouch the medical expenses
that recovery would be limited
to seven hundred fifty thousand
dollars so is the protection is
there for the provider but the
jury doesn't know it because
frankly it's not relevant to the
jury's decision the jury is
making an assessment one of the
damages worth encouraging that's
all the juries your they're not
negotiating within the framework
of the act that's for the act
itself so we're saying three
words a lot of money this is
what you wanted to.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman your your answer came
needs five more questions none
of which deal with the with the
bills so we may have to take
that one offline later on.
Madam speaker and gentleman as
we continue on I don't see
through G. as I understand the
five point the fund increases
healthcare providers cap.
Beginning in twenty twenty two.
Starting at four million.
But the amount of five hundred
thousand dollars a year three
twenty twenty six ending at six
million.
At which point.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
Beginning in nineteen and two
thousand twenty seven that
adjusted to the CPR.
Please madam speaker and
gentleman tell me if I'm reading
that correct and then Madam
speaker and gentleman tell me
what.
Tell me one if you don't mind
madam speaker gentleman you know
this is we're it's it's an
excellent question because it is
something that I wish the
legislature did more often.
This is the party's remembered
that did this.
The effectively what they're
doing is is there providing
certainty reliability so that
when the cap yes six million
dollars under paragraph G.
beginning on January one twenty
twenty seven then that cap goes
up as the power of money as
inflation goes up the
legislature's in call back say
in thirty years to update the
cap as we're doing now.
Why is that so important because
it provides madam speaker
gentleman's predictability and
reliability for the providers
themselves and for the insurance
companies so they know what's
going on and most importantly
for the fund so it knows exactly
what it is to extract I mean.
Madam speaker and gentleman
little I'm just going to give
you the example of this.
Businesses are constantly saying
they need predictability and
reliability.
And yet think about what we do
is but I'm not just saying this
by way of example minimum wage.
The legislature comes are we you
know a few years or maybe three
decades incomes and updates the
minimum wage.
That is in on certain an
unreliable way to run minimum
wage Bedford workers it's bad
for business if we attach the
CBI to our everybody would know
what to expect and I think what
the parties decided to do I can
guess the intent of the parties
just.
Let's not leave it up to a bunch
of politicians to decide ten
years from now what the new
caption three we get to control
this by having an independent
index the consumer price index
to tell us what that job is
going to be in twenty twenty
eight twenty twenty nine twenty
thirty and we don't have to
exert political power one way or
the other to come back in and
set a new cap and madam speaker
gentleman's it does something
great for us we got plenty to
work on we don't need to
constantly come back and revisit
this cap.
And that's why the consumer
price index frankly in my mind
is such a good idea and why we
should be doing it more often
with other pieces of legislation
Madam speaker gentle.
Madam speaker and gentleman I
appreciate that answer
I think madam speaker and
gentleman at some point in time
we can care your conversation
with respect to the minimum wage
and and tying that potentially
to the CPI or some similar idea
later on I.
I think we differ on that one
and I I look forward to that
debate.
Madam speaker and gentleman up
on on page seven now item H..
Can you explain to me why we
went through the deletions that
we went through on that.
And
What explain to me if you wanted
them to the people listening
and.
Accrued medical care and related
benefits I now understand madam
speaker and gentleman that the
that that's not a change in the
bill but I don't think that
everybody understands what those
words mean up Madam speaker and
gentleman simply put it means
that you're going to be
evaluating in addition to the
compensatory damages those
things like you know say someone
dies the value of life lost
earnings pain and suffering the
kinds of damages the people talk
about separate from that are the
medical expenses related to the
injury that the patient has
suffered.
And will suffer in the future
and what's happened that when it
says the value of accrued
medical care and related
benefits shall not be subject to
what it did was it took out that
cap there have been a gap the
parties clearly negotiated that
there would no longer be a cap
on those specific kinds of
damages the medical bills that
are associated with the
out there and that I can't I
can't answer the in general
sales such as part of the
negotiations that goes on
between these disparate parts.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman.
So
With respect to Madam speaker
and gentleman madam chair John I
apologize I want to make sure
I've been deprivations Mr Vargas
is literally yelling into the
phone to me that there was there
was not a cap it's now different
gaps so I wanna make that clear
and I apologize madam speaker
gentleman's I'm no longer
batting a thousand percent.
Well we'll keep it at thirty
three percent hopefully by the
end of the line.
Madam speaker and gentleman then
the next paragraph below was was
struck out in in committee and
and is now in the bill we're
addressing current can you
explain to me why we struck out
the the monetary damages shall
not be awarded for future
medical expenses and malpractice
claims.
So madam speaker gentleman's I
don't remember who was in C.
pack or not so let me just see
if I can explain it.
Madam speaker gentleman's under
the.
Four under the act as it
currently exists.
Patients who are the victims of
malpractice.
Would apply for
their medical expenses as
incurred so they had to grab a
corrective surgery they were
applied for it
are they would apply for those
cost cost of that medical
treatment.
What happened was it didn't work
we just the the in the office
superintendent church would
never set up to be insurance
from and so they literally did
not have anyone staffing.
To see no insurance company
would have okay you come in
you've got these medical
expenses are they related to
what happened how much are they
are the regional none of that
was done so I think at the time
the number was incredibly low of
the hundreds of patients that
had applied for are that were
put under this act I think you
were less than our last Mr
borders but I think it will for.
Six there were six stations that
were regularly being reimbursed
medical expenses it just didn't
work so they took that all out
and as you'll see as we go
through this instead they'll be
a law some assessed of expected
medical expenses in the future
and that's what will be provided
to the patient rather than
paying as you go along and have
the offices superintendent
insurance being paid it's just
not going to be a lump sum so
again it's it's it's not just
the negotiations it's also
recognizing the reality that the
medical malpractice act in that
regard did not work and it was a
corrective action that was long
overdue.
Thank you madam speaker and
thank you gentleman.
As we got a item I on the same
page.
Okay I would appreciate madam
speaker and gentleman.
Is if I understand this we're
trying the dollar value changes
to previous parts of the bill
that we've already discussed.
The end of the item I.
It talks about.
Except as provided in subsection
KA of the section Madam speaker
and gentleman.
If you would please explain how
these to relate.
To one another thank you.
R. madam speaker gentleman's so
the way this works is that the
health care provider the
individual position member of
the seven fifty is different
from hospital.
They have to find.
Coverage up to two hundred fifty
thousand dollars there we go
back to that section you
referred to earlier so that's
part of their responsibility
under the act above two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars is
paid for through the patient's
compensation fund that
subsection K. so that's how
those work together.
Madam speaker and gentlemen that
does I understand that.
The the patient fund.
Or the the the fund that we're
talking about here
only pays out up to seven
hundred fifty thousand is that
correct so then she remembered
it's two years so you have the
first two hundred fifty is paid
for through the physicians
insurance let's say and then the
next five hundred thousand and
is paid for by the patient's
compensation.
Thank you madam speaker and
thank you gentleman so so.
Help me understand where does
after seven hundred fifty
thousand I understand that that
it's not really addressed in
this bill but I think madam
speaker and gentleman that that
would be beneficial for the
public to know I'm sorry madam
speaker John I thought I I I had
said something wrong but my
phone was yelling at me so I
need to listen and I'm speaker
John if you could repeat that.
Sure thank you madam speaker and
gentleman so we've discussed the
the the the Mr Stroman doctors
insurance of the nurses
insurance.
Policy carries them up to two
hundred fifty and then the fun
takes it from two fifty to seven
fifty what happens after seven
fifty I don't see anywhere in
this document that discusses
what happens with the claim
above seven fifty.
So madam speaker gentleman yeah
I just want to make sure as
we're going to this explaining
it in a way that secretary so.
Think about it in terms of three
different kinds of one state
damages that's not really the
correct way to say it but there
is the seven hundred fifty
thousand as a cap on damages
except for medical expenses
which are coming up.
What you're paying in excess of
the seven hundred fifty thousand
out of the funds so it's not
just capped at seven fifty but
except for those medical
expenses it's capped and as we
get to it she hundred damages
which are not paid for out of
the funds.
So no one is responsible for the
five hundred thousand.
What's the lump sum amount for
the medical expenses.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you general.
So moving on to section four of
the bill we're still on page
right now we will move them to
page nine as well.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
Can you do me a favor and for
myself and for the public
listening then.
Describe me the deletions in
section four and the additions.
Miss madam speaker gentleman
even a little lesions look at
substantial they really come
down to a simple concept they
eliminated in this act this
ammendment if this bill is now
adopted and we accept the Senate
amendment and this goes the
governor we've eliminated that
pay as you go system that I
described that's what these
programs for we go to that's
what's been the lead.
Madam speaker and gentleman the
additions.
Madam speaker John that's a lump
sum payment we're talking about.
That's the new system it's a
lump sum payment rather than
that pay issue go.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman and so in that I don't
see.
On page ten.
Does that Mary the limits of
recovery to the virgin section
for.
Madam speaker gentleman yes.
Thank you madam speaker and all
of.
Madam speaker and gentleman in
section five.
The existing statutes talk about
the district courts and then
this one with respect to the
continuing.
Jurisdiction.
Can you madam speaker and
gentleman.
Through this with respect to the
deletions of the existing
statute and the additions back
in and how each of those make
this.
piece of legislation better for.
The providers and the public so
madam speaker gentleman's so we
go back to under the act as it
currently exists because in the
actor was this notion patients
go the courts retain
jurisdiction you know the theory
was maybe over the lifetime of
the patient because that didn't
work.
And because we're talking about
lump sum payments there's no
reason to have within this act
anymore the continuing
jurisdiction of the court case
is resolved point out like any
other case that way works done
so there's no reason to have
language in here that maybe it's
somehow different from other
case basis resolved court
jurisdiction ends.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman.
Moving on to section six page
eleven.
As we go through in the US we
have several deletions and
additions to the limitations.
In addition madam speaker and
gentleman there's another.
Couple of words in here that I
don't truly understand what they
mean and the and madam speaker
and gentleman I would appreciate
understanding of the words age
of majority.
So madam speaker John I mean
this is one of those things that
has lawyers are going through
they realized to the Act doesn't
comport with current case law so
they just brought it up to date
so for example miners it is one
year after the age of majority
that they will not be able to R.
us at that's now when we're
talking about the staff
limitation and so the
extinguishment of the action or
not because the staff
limitations is now consistent
with New Mexico case law which
was antiquated in the Old Act
it's just printing the act just
caught up with where we're at.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman
So for the second part of my
question please to provide for
the layman what what is the age
of majority.
Madam speaker John and safety.
Sorry madam speaker don't did
you say eighteen madam speaker
gentleman's I did eighteen.
Madam speaker and gentleman as I
understand that's based off of
the existing case law.
Madam speaker John and I had to
check with my expert but that's
why statute.
The age of majority is actually
set up by this body in statute.
Thank you.
So madam speaker and gentleman
we get to the part of the bill
where we start creating things
and or deleting and re defining
things
a substantial basis
Madam speaker and gentleman as I
understand it.
The medical review commission
already exists is that correct
Madam speaker John that is
correct.
So madam speaker and gentleman.
This section appears to change
the commission's directives by
removing.
The definition and the the words
health care and providers as
defined in section one C..
And and look and then lose those
words.
Madam speaker and gentleman and
events are stored independent
providers as defined in section
one eighty wasn't affected date.
January first twenty twenty one.
And so madam speaker and
gentleman just the phone correct
with what I'm reading out of
section seven this would be
consistent with.
What Madam speaker and gentleman
the discussions gone well so far
with respect to no longer
providing this.
Questions listless Act.
To
the health care providers and
focusing focus specifically on
the independent providers and
Mike in my reading that right or
if not can you clarify madam
speaker John madam speaker
gentleman's I I don't mean to
make fun of you you almost give
me a heart attack because you
you read it wrong because I
thought wait a minute you can't
hear the effective date can't be
January first twenty twenty one
because we're past that so it's
July first twenty twenty one
which is correct that's okay
Madam speaker John I made plenty
of mistakes so I just I just it
was just a moment where I'm
thinking I'll we have a problem
no that is correct so we never
we go back to the reason we're
redefining years is because no
longer want hospitals and
facilities to be part of the
medical review panel because
they were literally swamping.
So that's what was worked out
they will no longer children
this is what we're gets a little
more complex.
The hospitals and facilities
will be part of the medical
malpractice sent.
And will for example receive the
benefit of the caps.
They will not be receiving the
benefit of the medical legal Pam
that'll be for the independent
providers that's to make it work
because frankly it won't work
the way it's intended to work
you have all of these claims
that are coming in from
hospitals and facilities so this
section goes to clean that up
very specifically in very nice.
I do appreciate your patience
and your time which reflects
planning this and and I do think
madam speaker and gentleman the
the this is critical for
everybody we truly understand.
Not only won the multiple
changes that have been made to
this piece of legislation from
its inception for your Sir now.
It also.
Where it takes us in the future
should this eight piece of
legislation passed.
So with that.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
The commission thank.
Is a route.
This process is to review the
malpractice claims against
independent providers.
And those independent of
providers madam speaker and
gentlemen are the independent
provider defined in section one
he of the staff.
Am I reading that correctly
Madam speaker gentleman you are.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman.
Madam speaker and gentleman on
page thirteen of the bill.
We go into section eight.
The commission decision required
application.
Madam speaker and gentleman as
as I read the this.
We make some changes and section
a.
We strike out health care when
we have the word independent
again and this is Madam speaker
and gentleman a common theme for
the bill as as we discussed in
your next line madam speaker and
gentleman.
With respect to the US it also
adds madam speaker and
gentleman.
The independent providers
employer.
Master principle based on the
theory of response.
Representative anyway so.
Madam speaker John it slapped
it's responding at superiore.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman I should look that
word up first
And lose fear or other
derivatives and derivatives
bearing of recovery can you
explain those words to me in
layman's terms Madam speaker it
basically means if you're gonna
sue of physician or any of their
employees then I I'm and I'm
already I I am sure my phone is
now blowing up with the expert
James O. more complicated than
that but it's really first for
for our purposes it is the
independent let's say position
and the people that work for
that position you can't sue that
person until you made an
application at the medical legal
down you can't filed a claim
that really hasn't changed
that's true we current case law
what I'm I'm a the current
statutes rather what is
different is again they are
trying to distinguish between
that independent provider and
the answer to use like a
hospital or facility so that you
know they've already said that
so the other cleaning up the
language to make it clear if you
wanted to see you as an employee
working for the doctor nursing
positions assistant someone like
that you would have to make an
application with the panel
before going out ensuring the
practice and I hope madam
speaker gentleman that makes
sense.
Madam speaker and gentleman and
I appreciate that that actually
answers the second part of my
question but Madam speaker and
gentleman.
If I understand the words that
you're saying there because it
does say or the independent
providers employer is there no
K. madam speaker and gentleman
where the independent providers
of border could be health care
facility an outpatient facility.
Madam speaker John and this is
why it is a real advantage to
having experts in this area why
are you know so Senate judiciary
not to Tinker with the language
because I think while I give you
a correct answer it's an
excellent question madam speaker
John I would give you a complete
answer because based on case law
we're trying to avoid is lawyers
that are acting on behalf of
patients going around the drive
in suing the practice.
To avoid the caps of the medical
malpractice.
And so this would require but
even if you're suing the
practice you're still within the
act so this is specific case you
told it to me I couldn't from my
life for member it from two
minutes ago when you told to the
but there's a case that
basically says you can't do that
so that's this language is to
clarify what's already existing
case law in it and avoid.
That kind of loophole that might
otherwise suggest and so it is
related to protective position
in their practice and put them
where they intended to be under
the medical malpractice.
Madam speaker and gentleman I
appreciate that at the end of
that same section section eight
A..
At the end of the says however
that an independent provider and
the patient may stipulate to
forego the panel process that's
a that's a new language added in
and madam speaker and gentleman
can you explain to me why that
new languages added and how it
benefits both the provider and
the patient Madam speaker and
gentleman this where I'm going
to gas as the negotiations
because much of logically make
sense to me if both the if both
the patient and the physician
malpractice in health care
provider agree there would be a
colossal waste of time to go
through the medical legal panel
they can together agree to say
we're not gonna do this we're
going to discover right to
litigation or whatever and just
avoid the panel there there's no
reason to go through a process
if both sides agree that would
be a waste of time and that just
makes sense to me and my guess
is that has happened and they
just decided Hey as long as
we're doing this act let's
address that why make the
parties go to a medical legal
panel if due to where we want to
because the whole idea of a
panel is to inform one side or
the other do they have a valid
claim or a valid defense.
And so if the other party
sitting Sir going to benefit
from that why do it why waste
everybody's time.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you speaker and thank you
gentlemen for explaining that
In both cases in that case the
fund is still available Madam
speaker and gentleman to the
patient and the provider correct
madam speaker this is we're not
talking we're no longer talking
about the fund we're really
talking about the act that's why
I want to make that distinction
in what once you're within the
act you have the protection of
the medical legal Pam the fund
has to do with the money this is
just a and I'm AT supplemental
protection that a physician has
if they're part of the act but
you have to go through this
panel before the patient can
file a lawsuit that has not
change with respect to
independent providers.
Thank you madam speaker and
thank you general of the liver
spots.
I'm learning a whole lot more
about insurance and I want to.
And so madam speaker and
gentleman.
At any point in this part of the
conversation to the three
different
Thanks recovery the three
different types malpractice the
punitive the past and future
medical and other damages from
into this conversation what
point in time in this
conversation we get into those.
So madam speaker gentleman's.
These are just different types
of damages that are available to
anyone filing a claim if the
facts support.
So for example compensatory
damages in a I want to talk
about the area I'm familiar
we're suing lawyers but it would
be similar to showing doctors in
this instance I could sue a
lawyer because they missed a
statute they didn't do enough
very isolated or dishonestly but
they blew a statute and the
claim went away I would to the
water for called compensatory
damages to compensate the person
for the damages that were
sustained as a result of lawyer
falling below the what's called
reasonable standard care that is
very different from chairman
damages were let's say a lawyer
stole clients money store where
property over so outrageously
reckless and I've had.
They they they don't necessarily
more damage the client but we
want to punish that behavior the
jury is if the judge will let
that go to a jury in it it's not
automatic judges the gatekeeper
on that.
If the factual rise to show what
is I think it's poder and
reckless disregard is I believe
the language out of what's
called the jury instruction the
court will typically have a
motion in front of him or her to
decide whether the facts would
rise to the level of the jury
could reasonably believe support
team or damages and in those
facts are presented to the jury
and the jury can award both
compensatory damages and
punitive damages but the gate
keepers always going to be the
judge this is no different in a
medical malpractice projects
that you can collect both
compensatory and punitive
damage.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman.
So as as I read the section we.
Madam speaker and gentleman we
delete the original verbiage of
how the application works and we
added one two three four.
At five different pieces that
basically takes of the latest
news and an expanded.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
Can you do me a favor and tell
me.
Why.
Those pieces are so critical to
the this as and as we've taken
healthcare providers that we put
the independent provider in.
I I'm just trying to understand
why some of these pieces are
more important now than they
were before John are you talking
about I just make sure I just
wanna make sure we're on the
same section are you talking
about page thirteen section B.
this application shall contain
the following.
Yes madam speaker and gentleman
so madam speaker John really
that's just based on experience
from the past four decades that
what the participants is again
the benefit of experience over
years what the decided is it
short short of the eight yes.
Streamline the process in that
now you're providing information
that the panel was asking for
over and over again so rather
than.
Keep repeating the exercise of
do we need this information is
for the statute because it's
just based on years of
experience this is what the
panel is going to need to see so
they just listed all so I just
literally just a pragmatic
decision on the part of the
negotiators.
Madam speaker and gentleman I
appreciate that answer and so
what we're what we're saying
this is the lessons learned over
over almost forty years we we
put in the paper.
Madam speaker and and gentleman
with respect to that.
Why at this point in time in the
application process did we not
find the the panel was.
The ability to add other
requirements as necessary.
To to the US as they've learned
that and so we're we're dialing
the stand madam speaker and
gentleman we've got some health
care providers we don't stand up
in a providers and we've learned
that well we've added five
sections over forty years so
it's just even the math that and
say every every ten years we
learned a critical lesson.
Madam speaker and gentleman why
don't we widening during this
process the
The providers out there the the
I've been part of this
negotiation in this change and
and in the in the bill why
didn't why did they ask or did
they ask madam speaker and
gentleman for some more latitude
with respect to that.
Madam speaker John I really have
no idea I mean I think this was
designed really just to respond
to what is the panel would be
asking court I can't really give
an answer that that stripper
develop
I don't want to create the
answer as I just was going back
to the beginning part of our
conversation when we were
talking about how we put numbers
in there into the into the spill
that allowed after certain
amount of time madam speaker
gentleman's for CPI to take over
it and madam speaker and
gentleman the.
Your
Your comments with respect to.
Making the legislation a little
bit easier to wear
didn't have to keep coming back
in front of this body every
time.
So moving on madam speaker and
gentleman.
No section nine and this section
nine madam speaker and gentleman
beginning on page fourteen we're
we're beginning to amend the
application procedure and again
the the the fall the developing
team here is is for moving
health care providers adding
independent providers.
But we also have.
A couple of the of the ditions
in here and.
Madam speaker and gentleman the
first one so first line and
second line and some section
subsection may section nine.
actually so line two and line
three the directors designating
and and so the director in this
case madam speaker gentleman's.
Is the commission or what we
have one now I and I believe
it's my broadcast let me just
chair.
So madam speaker and gentleman
on I was just looking for.
Madam speaker Johnston Center
the governor again to the actor
he's been the acting director
for twenty years.
Madam speaker and gentleman I
would doubt I appreciate that
answer I wasn't actually looking
for the specific name out she's
trying to understand who the
director was and madam speaker
and gentleman this director.
In the word director in this
case is not synonymous with
Madam speaker and gentleman
what's the word superintendent
used earlier this fall in this
bill all know Madam speaker John
these are entirely different
people.
Okay madam speaker don't can you
explain the differences between
those two jobs short of the
office of the superintendent of
insurance is run by the
superintendent entrance covered
a multitude of different kinds
of functions having at some
having not many most of act
nothing to do with medical
malpractice the commission
director is literally running
these pounds that's the job.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen for that answer.
So madam speaker and gentleman
now we go to section ten page
fifteen of the of the bill and
In this bill Erin this piece of
the legislation we we avid
structural different pieces can
you
please explain about the
additions and and the violations
within the so that the public
can understand me and to of the
section of the bill.
Yeah Madam speaker and gentleman
again it's the same kind of
we're making sure that entities
hospitals outpatient facilities
are not part of the medical
legal panel review process
that's paragraphs a and B. and
if you look at the bottom I
suspect this is again a matter
of experience at your your words
has the language of the
discretion of the panel chair
hearing involving multiple
defendants may include fewer
than three panelists from
independent providers profession
and fewer than three lawyer
panel members per defendant Mike
yesterday as it's just based on
experience on how difficult it
can sometimes be to establish a
panel so they want to have the
panel without the with the
flexibility of being able to
find it without strictly adhered
to the three Miller three doctor
panel it's just work when
they're.
So madam speaker and gentleman
can you give me a case.
And that an example.
Of the situation where we may
have multiple defendants.
So madam speaker gentleman let's
say that your surgery that is
for lack of a better term
botched you're both the amnesty
geologist and searching their
ordinarily you would have to
have on the panel an expert
industry knowledge just as well
as an expert general surgeon
this provides some flexibility
for that process you would need
that.
So madam speaker and gentleman
if I understand that correctly
yes the surgeon and the
anesthesiologist agreed to it
thank you reduce or not have the
three and three for both of that
both.
Those people would that be
correct madam speaker gentle.
Yeah madam speaker John that's
correct you're right.
Thank you so does and I
appreciate that so does require
them to be in agreement with
respect to that the madam
speaker and gentleman I can I
can imagine at some point in
time during it any type of
lawsuit the people that were
were best friends before hand
may not be during the lawsuit.
Madam speaker gentleman's
speaking as a lawyer to choose
worse I can confirm that that's
the case.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen.
So.
Madam speaker and gentleman we
we move on to
Sections section eleven page
seventeen.
At the end of the.
This is this is defining the
time and date of the hearing.
And madam speaker and gentleman
why.
Did we feel it necessary to add
the new language at the end of
this part.
Madam speaker gentleman's I I
again I don't think it's find it
necessary as much as provides
flexibility that is yes get the
party it to one party agrees
the hearing can be conducted the
of Video Conference and.
That you but I don't know this
that that is in part experienced
this pandemic.
That we're discovering that in
many cases you can conduct these
creditors by zoom and they work
just as a fact which I think it
is to provide that flexibility.
Thank you very much Madam
speaker and gentleman I'm sure
that.
Receive that answer in this
piece of the legislation
probably brings these to some
people because as we discussed
there are people that take the
pandemic very seriously and and
would prefer to.
Madam speaker and gentleman to
limit.
Their exposure to different
people.
Madam speaker and gentleman on
the same page.
Thank you.
On the same page at the bottom
of the page we go to section
twelve which goes through
hearing procedures.
Madam speaker and gentleman this
the.
This section confuses me a
little bit with respect to the
way that I read the language in
the L. statute verses what we're
trying to accomplish here.
And so madam speaker and
gentleman as I understand with
the LFC staff to.
The panel.
Made a recommendation.
Is that would that be a fair
statement was way that I read
the L. statute.
So madam speaker John no they
don't make a recommendation what
they're doing is is they have at
the end of the panel you present
the case are you know maybe
people the next day they get or
maybe that knowledge the pending
on how the panel works they'll
get literally a two line
decision.
The physician and I'm going to
paraphrase this as my phone will
get me yelling at me but just
for purposes this so that it's
not our stated the intent of
what's happening it'll be by a
vote of state six and nothing we
find that the position did fall
below the standard of care.
By a vote of six to nothing we
find that the then I let's say
the negligence of the position
did not cause any injuries to
the page.
What lawyers referred to as a
standard care or whether that
association was negligence
negligence and the second
question is what Moores refers
causation.
So you know I I twice a year I
will
I teach a class of the law
school.
And I will commonly say to
people
let's say a lawyer this is to
explain the difference between
those two questions.
Let's say a lawyer human hire a
lawyer and I I think this is
assumed was way to say that you
hire a lawyer for a car accident
case.
And you subtler signs of fever.
And we're blows the statue
limitations.
So we can't while the case.
So I say to law students.
Is that what you're subject to a
malpractice lawsuit has he
committed malpractice do you
know enough to know that the
lawyer should be sued and
typically what will happen is
about half the hands will go up
yes and have their hands will go
up no the answer is you don't
know or not because even though
we're made a mistake and didn't
file a case and are you don't
know if that costs the person
any money because maybe there
were on the wrong side of the
road maybe they were drunk maybe
they didn't have any injuries
maybe was terrible K. to start
that's the same way and medical
negligence that the panelists
really answer to questions.
Did the doctor screw up was the
doctor negligent to the doctor
fall below the standard of care.
But also the question is yes did
you make any diversity caused
damage.
Maybe the doctor you know.
I did operation and didn't do it
correctly state fell below the
standard of care for patients I.
In that case there's really no
malpractice case and so what's
happening is with these panels
is is designed to tell the
patient and the doctor the
provider.
This is a and for lack of a
better term this is a viable
case or it's not not it's not
binding and is not admissible
later on.
But it is to tell both sides she
we have a problem here or we
don't have a problem that has in
no way changed as a result of
this language and they didn't
change year thank you madam
speaker John.
Madam speaker and gentlemen so
as I and I appreciate that
answer.
So if if I understand correctly.
With the existing process.
For lack of a better term
settlement terms.
You could have had a hung jury
on the panel where half the
people on the panel say one
thing and the other half say the
other this change this position
to the last piece of.
Item eighteen shall deliberate
and reach a decision makes sense
that's a requirement that the
panel will decide one way or
another in the positive or the
negative on those two questions
Madam speaker and gentleman that
you just addressed madam speaker
what what really happens is
let's say the panelists what.
Three three on one of those
questions are both the chair
that bridge the time that's the
same system that is not here.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen for for clarifying
that for me.
So madam speaker and gentleman.
The bottom of page eighteen we
go in the section thirteen which
is the patient's compensation
fund that currently exists.
Madam speaker and gentleman as
third party administrator
actuarial studies surcharges
claims appropriations.
Proof of authenticity.
Madam speaker and gentleman the
first question I have with
respect to this is this why do
we need to add another layer
into the system and have the
third party administrator
because Madam speaker and
gentleman that's what I a lot of
what doctors funding to trouble
in the first place was the
statute wasn't clear as to the
protections for the spot.
So in other words if you
remember Madam speaker gentleman
from C. pack.
When we talked about one of the
reasons but one was in trouble.
Was because you didn't have.
Competent actuarial studies.
That would be performed on a
regular in this case annual
basis.
That would provide the
administrator.
Which we all information it's
credible actuarial based
information on page two charging
affect premiums to hospitals
doctors and other healthcare
providers sure all of section
thirteen goes to is making that
a more professional system.
And making sure that we don't
have the problem that we had not
with the current superintendent
over the prior superintendent so
we never get ourselves in a
situation again.
Or hospitals are let into the
fund.
Without requiring the adequate
information and the tools
necessary for the patient
compensation fund and its
administrator to make sure that
there are adequate premiums
adequate surcharges assessed
against health care providers so
we don't get ourselves in the
position that we found our shop
we are finding ourselves in
right now with the deficit to
the far and I don't know madam
speaker gentleman if you
remember that conversation but
that's really what happens is
that they didn't have you know
when you apply to I get
insurance for example for your
car your insurance company
knowledge how many accidents
have you been involved the last
five years have any claims been
paid out where the accident
shortfall what were the
litigation expenses.
Madam speaker gentleman if you
don't know I will tell you your
insurance company knows that I
promise you we assess that prove
that's the information that was
missing that same kind of
information from the general
concept was missing in terms of
charging response bills and
adequate amount and so that's
why this is now but would
clearly in statute as to what's
going to be required to have it
run frankly in the way insurance
companies should remember OSI
OSI is not insured was never
intended to be but yet they were
expected to act like in George
come that's why this is being
set up among the much more
professional line consistent
with an insurance company and I
hope madam speaker gentleman's
that that answers your question.
Speaker and gentleman does
answer part of that creates
another question for me and I
will speak to the to the
insurance the second I can speak
from from knowledge with respect
to business that our insurance
company knows everything about
every person that drives
vehicles for the company I'm
involved with and
Madam speaker and gentleman
there they're crystal clear was
was certain.
With respect to certain driving
records on what has to be done
for them to be able to drive a
company vehicle so I'm
completely aware of that.
Weaker and gentleman.
With respect to the third party
administrator.
Well this third party
administrator also be
responsible for the investments
on that fund.
No madam speaker gentle in the
state investment fund is
responsible for that that's the
top page nineteen.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman on the set piece and I
appreciate you letting me know
well there it is right there and
so I do appreciate thank you
Clarifying that for me so.
We discuss the the studies with
respect to the surcharges Madam
speaker and gentleman as I
understand it.
The provider.
pays for malpractice insurance
and on top of that insurance
there's a surcharge that these
this fund is that correct in my
in my Optum American speaker
John that's for.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
What what is the basis for those
surcharges and and I understand
we talked about the actual
actual our studies also get that
word right yet but.
I understand the we have the
studies and stuff like that so
those surcharge percentages
Madam speaker and gentleman to
they change from one type of
provider to the next general
questions but they can change if
you look at the bottom of page
nineteen and I think it's
important to review because it
probably is frankly the the most
complex portion of this act of
this amendment and it is
designed to restore solvency to
this farm it says the
superintendent shall levy an
annual surcharge on all New
Mexico health care providers
qualifying under section forty
one I I.
Surcharge shall be determined by
the superintendent this is the
language that is designed to a
ensure both professionalism and
reliability with the advice of
the advisory board and based on
the annual independent actuarial
study the fund surcharge for
healthcare providers including
hospitals and outpatient health
care facilities.
Allocations of the fund and on
January one two thousand twenty
seven shall be based.
Sound actuarial principles using
data obtained from New Mexico
claims lost then it goes on
I know that I probably put
everybody to sleep just talking
about this but the fact is is
that this is frankly from my
point of view the most critical
part of this at.
It is designed to provide
reliability in terms of the
surcharges and assessments that
are made was not percentage but
is constantly updated to make
sure it's accurate and you have
an advisory board that's coming
up in the next section it is
going to review this so you have
certain years.
Of supervision for lack of a
better term to make sure the
process is done professionally
and well and why.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman so.
The other part of this addition
the title on section thirteen as
pro weight appropriations Madam
speaker and gentleman can you go
in and to detail on what we're
pro ready.
Yeah so madam speaker gentleman
what this is intended to do
Representative fifty six million
dollars that I was talking about
in terms the deficit so as the
next five years go on and the
hospitals remained for.
The assessment will be made to
determine the pro rat out
portion of the deficit that's a
tribute uble to the hospitals
verses the independent
commission so the whole idea is
is to make people responsible
for what's been paid out on a
program at a meeting kind of
Kerr MC Gee basis for rather
than just a uniform across the
board session that's that's
that's not the way you would
cover it that's not the way it's
going to be covered here so it's
a program assessment going over
the next five years the
intention of courses as the
hospitals leave the patient's
compensation fund and set up
their own fund that they will
have paid for all of the
exposure that they contributed
to one of our.
Thank you madam speaker and
thank you John.
The last piece of the spiral
talks about proof of loss of
authenticity can can can you
madam speaker and gentleman can
you talk on that for for a
little bit for the for the
general public after.
Madam speaker gentleman you're
stuck to my experts he has no
idea where that term came from I
can't answer that question.
All right all of these people as
well.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman I
that wasn't my intent I just
couldn't find anything in here
the talked about the and so I
was I was really confuse.
So madam chair Mr Stewart go on
madam speaker government if I
could just so you know I'm sure
remember I'm getting one side of
the equation here a an insurance
expert and somebody is also
trial or I'm sure it means
something to some of the other
participants on shorts important
but my experts from does not
know whether term came from but
I'm sure it's important
partition you know again that's
why it's so important that this
deal was structured in a way
that satisfy the purchase of
to this system but I can't
answer that question are.
Madam speaker and and gentleman
I I it was assumed that probably
relates back to the a portion of
the of the beginning part of
this bill work talks about the
requirements that the both the
independent.
practitioner in and the.
Hospitals and outpatient places
as well have receive proof of
authenticity with respect
potentially their ability and
availability of funds I don't
know that moving on into the
last section of this section
fourteen.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
I'm sorry John Madam speaker
John where are you at now.
I'm trying to figure that out
myself section fourteen I'm
sorry show page twenty two yes.
This is a new section of the
medical malpractice act
according to the documentation
in this Madam speaker and
gentleman the patients
compensation advisory board
Madam speaker and gentleman.
Can you talk to the depths of
the of of yours and your expert
witnesses capability on.
The advisory board of their
intent and how we came up with
the nine member and the list of
representatives on their Madam
speaker John I'm I can explain
to you what this sport is about
but let me start with the and
how they came up with it let me
give me just a minute ask my
act.
Madam speaker gentleman yeah I I
again I appreciate the question
is I was looking at it before we
were starting I was thinking how
did they come up with it when
you look at it what they did.
Which no it is it's it's not
only to say it this way Madam
speaker John and so cool what
they did is they took all the
stakeholders they took patient
advocacy groups that's not
travelers trial lawyers
hospitals doctors health care
providers and put them all on
board because they're all
stakeholders in this just.
They all have one goal.
And that is to make sure this
fund.
The patients compensation fund
remains solar because you
remember from C. pack Madam
speaker gentleman in nineteen
seventy six when this fund was
established it was established.
Attacked independent positions
that otherwise could not secure
or adequate malpractice
insurance so that benefited both
the doctors we're now able to
afford it given the protections
they ask for also benefited
patients even though there were
affected we subsidizing these
doctors by limiting their
recovery they at least were able
to recover some money under this
fund and so it makes sense then
you would have an advisory board
that is composed of all the
stakeholders now if you go to
subsection you to answer your
other question was the advisory
board do.
What it does is is they review
what's happening to make sure
the fund remain solvent so the
reviewing process and data the
setting up of surcharges of all
the qualified health care
providers there by the
superintendent that's the
superintendent of insurance
concerning surcharges the
revising them on how it should
be said going into the future
and how they have been set and
they prepare annual reports
Legislature on the operations
and financial condition of the
car so that the legislature can
also review it and so it's it's
a great way of investing the
stakeholders.
In the security and reliability
this far.
And that's probably in my mind
well maybe not the most
substantive portion of it that
section thirteen.
This is the one that I think
provides the most of confidence
in the system on behalf of the
stakeholders of the medical
malpractice a reader.
So madam speaker and gentle of
just to clarify for for myself.
In this section.
This is the advisory board for
the compensation fund so this is
the board as you just described
madam speaker and gentleman.
That oversees the fund itself.
Madam speaker and gentleman is
there any chance with respect to
the potential members on this
board Madam speaker and
gentleman that we could have a
conflict of interest and it's so
madam speaker and gentleman in
that situation why is it not
addressed in the section.
Madam speaker John in this
context conflict of interest is
really a misnomer you could
argue that everybody on this
panel as a conflict of interest
they all have a financial stake
one or the other so there are
some times where you have boards
like the US where everybody's
going to come and so the way you
address that is you don't worry
about the conflict of interest
you worry about the balance.
Does everybody coming in with
these conflicts is the board
balanced in a way that's fair to
the entire system and that's
what this was intended to do so
that's why conflicts were
dressed would make any sense.
So madam speaker and gentleman
with respect to that.
In this building the fund
advisory board these.
The potential for these people
to.
Influence any other part of the
panel and that was created in
the prior section
doesn't exist.
Madam speaker John Madam speaker
John it I do want to spend a
couple things the this or
doesn't make any decision all it
does is make it basically it's a
advisory board get the box and
remember this a Bollinger Care
there not getting paid.
So I think the those kinds of
concerns are alleviated by the
fact they really have no power
other than to review things and
find trying to be independent
locks what's going on advise the
superintendent but they have no
independent power to do
anything.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman.
So madam speaker gentleman's
you're almost done with me page
twenty four section fifteen.
Talk about payment of medical
review commission expenses and
so as I understand this is put
some certain value dollar value
into a fund that that can be
drawn from as needed.
I'm sorry madam speaker
gentleman's I missed the
question of the was a question I
apologize.
Quite all right Madam speaker
and gentleman section fifteen.
Deals with the an existing
statute payment of medical
review commissioning Spence's.
And add some new terminology and
there we increase.
The expenses of the commission
paid by the fund.
From three hundred thousand
dollars to five hundred thousand
dollars in a single year Madam
speaker and gentleman what was
the the background in the
history with respect to.
Needing an extra two hundred
thousand dollars in the state
funds are allowable and
expenses.
Yup madam speaker John and so
what happened not surprising the
hospitals in.
Is it swamped this fund.
And so you know they they
they're spending money on office
space you'll see a more or what
we've already been through
they're in charge of grabbing
the medical records of the got
to pay money for that because
they got to make a request.
so as these panels became more
more frequent and frankly busted
the system but they were still
doing them they kept reporting
to the chief justice as it as it
is in here and they were running
deficits.
And so I remember in fact in the
middle of all of this getting a
call from a gentleman I
mentioned my correct house that
they were going to need more
money because of all the deficit
that it happened as a result
these hospitals coming in so
that's where the increased
expenses came from and hopefully
and that by the way is in the
patient's proposition Fund
budget and approved that's why
it's not before appropriation so
that money is there but if there
were questions came directly
from the commission.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen
Madam speaker and gentleman I
want to jump through section
sixteen and seventeen well with
respect to seventeen basically
what we've done is we've
repealed everything that makes
us law makes this bill is passed
work with me the correct
statement Madam speaker John
that's correct.
Thank you very much for that and
then so madam speaker and
gentleman we have an effective
date on specific provisions of
this section seven thirteen and
fourteen which were discussed in
depth all the way through as
July first of twenty twenty one
and and madam speaker and
gentleman that date seems to
work well with everything that
I've read a I have no.
on that date I just wanted the
public to know the specifics
with respect to that the other
pieces that the remaining
sections of this.
Hold off until Jan for January
first twenty twenty two Madam
speaker and gentleman as I read
statute R. as I read the the
Pete the piece of legislation in
front of us the state's match as
well so madam speaker and
gentleman hi appreciate your
indulging me today and and going
through this piece by piece of
the our public can understand
the extent of this bill and
understand why in in in your
opinion is comparing this bill
that this is important and I
appreciate that thank you madam
speaker John I appreciate you've
gone through this so thoroughly
that I'm certain there are no
other questions that we can now
get to the motion to I
appreciate very much your that
such a detailed comprehensive
and informative approach thank
you very much madam speaker and
I look forward to the body
voting on the motion to concur.
Madam speaker I yield back.
Seeing.
Seeing no further debate.
Seeing further debate the gentle
lady from Bernalillo
Representative Thomson.
Thank you madam chair well the
gentleman from Santa you'll.
Madam speaker I will gladly
yield to the gentle lady from
Bernalillo thank you speak Madam
speaker and gentleman so I am
probably one of only maybe two
people in this body that have
have carried malpractice
insurance and as a physical
therapist I am glad to say that
we never get sued essentially
and not so my malpractice
insurance it's quite reasonable
but I always have it just in
case so I was thinking back
madam chair and and gentlemen
back to last year when the
beginnings of this bill kind of
rumbled into the committee and
now we were hearing from all
sides hair on fire and you know
nobody was happy and we did hear
this bill Madam speaker and
gentleman and the essentially
what came out of that first
hearing was that that the bill
was not ready for prime time and
so I'm assuming miss madam

Mr speaker and gentleman it is
the it is created and composed
of seven members they are
pointed with due regard to
culture and geographical
diversity one members appointed

minority floor leader one member
is appointed by the president
for ten and one is appointed by
the minority floor leader of the
Senate two members are appointed
by the state ethics commission

largest or second largest
political parties of the state
and one members appointed by the
state ethics commission you
shall be related not be related

New Mexico courts of appeals who
shall chair the committee no
more than three members of the

we
it's been a long road coming to
this point work down to the last
hour but I appreciate to bring

redistricting process well about
Mr speaker dollars yes Mr
