good morning Mr president I ask

that the record show that Senate
objections in another to explain
the bill thank you Mr president
Senate bill two hundred and
twenty three comes to us after
some excellent work and
collaboration between the
renovation of the UNM
comprehensive cancer center
which provides lifesaving cancer
care services and treatments to
New Mexicans from all of our
first phase of the project those
bonds will expire in a few years
with this legislation does is
bonds that will be issued and
backed by that revenue will be
managed by the New Mexico
finance authority so we can
insured that this project will
obtain the benefits of the New
the lotus centers we're debating
Senate bill two twenty three
Senator Brandt thank you Mr
president with the sponsor yield
yes Mr president thank you Mr
bonded against is that correct
Mr president now what were
essentially is in twenty twenty
five our current dedication of
severance tax revenue which
extension a new series of bonds
can be issued by the NMFA that
may come in different forms for
example the New Mexico finance
authority may issue a bond to
for the local entities which in
this case is the cancer center.
Mister president senator so is
part of the problem that people
are smoking as much anymore as a
stream remains stable enough
that New Mexico finance
authority
has no issue with that
underlying revenue stream to
support a bond issuance at this
there was such instability in
that revenue stream to not
support the debt issuance.
Thank you Mr president thank you
senator and I'm wondering if
is paid back does that money
then come back to the state or
does it stay with the cancer
center so Mister president after
the bond is expired the revenue
will continue to stay with the
two pieces there is a portion of
cigarette tax that goes to the
cancer center right now for
operations and one source that
goes for capital.
for some purpose such as to do a
phase three or to keep up with
medical technology the bill
would dedicate that money to the
operational line Mr president.
internet.
So much president center we're
just getting rid of the sunset
so that that funding source
would be there forever
absolutely Mr president because
problem New Mexico on X.
specially low income New
Mexicans will likely need this
access to this sort of care for
decades into the future.
So much present center do you
to the cancer center a
percentage of the tax or is it a
set.
Amount is the young someone
trying to say there you Mr
guaranteed number in statute.
Thank you Mr president center so
if those other bills were passed
and become law then the cancer
center could potentially receive
This presents I don't
necessarily disagree that having
a the cancer center well funded
would would be a bad thing or a
eight times so it is one of the
things that is affected my
family greatly so thank you for
the bill I just.
Was trying to figure out exactly
Thank you Mr president and well
the Senator you'll for question
on the other deals yes Mr
president thank you Mr president
so in the past this fund has
funds for cancer centers like
healer regional and I know that
there is another hospital as
cannibalize on on the revenue
streams that otherwise be
available to other
beneficiaries.

number five on your calendar
excuse me I don't appointed
calendar Senate bill three six
seven as amended with emergency
clause constitutional revision
seven as amended on final
passage has been taken and that
it is now subject to debate
amendment or substitution no
objections Senator about this to
legislature that have been
submitted thirty one.
Of we have been in this
piecemeal approach of attacking
our constitution or evaluating
or updating our constitution as
you see it since statehood we've
that we need to think hard
about.
There are three ways to amend
our constitution and we need to
be updated the way we conduct
our business here and really
taking a step back to assess
other states do that we have a
best practices analysis that we
convene a commission that is set
forth in our constitution now to
assess our constitution and have
them study for one year and make
session alone the second way to
do it the constitutional
convention we did that once
before as predictably we might
think it because to some issue
to have a convention about the
third ways this way which is to
the governor and for them to
study our constitution make
recommendations to us which we
can put on the ballot as a
single item and re evaluate does
it really make sense for us to
be meeting thirty days and then
should be talking about and we
don't have a mechanism in place
there's nobody studying and
looking at these issues and a
macro way and so this bill would
do that for one year and and
questions Senator is remaining
Senate bill three sixty seven as
amended with emergency clause
Senator Steinborn.
All right Mr president with
Senator Sanchez please deal.
The steel okay.
So Mister president senator
And and as you say looking at
what other states are done I
want to kind of disagree with
one of how you frame it as one
when I was in the legislature
passed the tactics
constitutional amendment
limiting property taxes for
veterans us rationally chartered
That are good ideas it would not
come from this commission I
quite frankly would you agree
with that statement.
Present senator.
Yes I agree we heard percent
would you have done some
other things so many of us can
be very proud of our work with
amending the constitution but
but I would submit to you that
doing this piecemeal bit by bit
every two years on on election
Senator that's where I was just
kind of disagree with that
characterization is not one of
the other it's really felt
and what you what you are
going maybe best practices and
all that certainly have the
value I just.
I just recognize that what the
work we do on other
But but I'm sure being that it's
bipartisan and bicameral and.
It's going to be.
On the policy side somewhat
watered down to just basically
to refine number get rid of
antiquated language I just would
not necessarily look for any
cutting edge policy per se and
then that way
that'll deadlines at the end
this funds for only one year the
commission would exist for only
one year it would sunset
automatically so this is not a
permanent commission and is
funded only for that one year to
have nonvoting members ex
officio.
Okay thank you Mr president but
there's no there's no
requirement that they.
That they are.
Senator that's correct and and I
I think it's important for me to
to note again that that this
commission already exists in our
constitution that the
opportunity to do this the
existence of this commission is
Steinborn the the commission
came up with a very extensive
report I really commend members
to look at it look at that look
at the report from twenty five
years it's fascinating because
so many of the issues they were
But there's no there's no

saying well the required two
thirds we're gonna need ten
voting members.
recommendation here to come back
with positive media capital and
they're gonna say Hey the
constitutional commission to
approve this and you're gonna
get political momentum
for for discussion purposes
let's just say Republican a
Democrat now doesn't have to be
Republican Democrat but let's
just simplify the argument that
the discussion so we have six
two Democrats and one Republican
that would leave this commission
with eight Democrats and seven
Republicans okay so right now
the idea of looking into
constitutional issues I very
much support that but I just
want to try to take the politics
out of it so they could come
back and you could have a
Democrat votes in favor and
for that major it would require
at least some smidgen of
bipartisanship.
and so like I said I I'd rather
different reasons and and so you
know that that that person could
it could not really reflect
mainstream a party ideals but
anyway I think this is a
party to to get this
approval going and I I very
respectfully bring this
ammendment just mainly because I
I would just really appreciate
discussion I I would love to
you Mr president.
Thank you Senate's committee we
are debating this floor
amendment I'm gonna go first to
Senator mantas.
Thank you for the most part you
You know we look at Washington
DC And wherever they were
debating the a filibuster rule
how many votes as a take the
Democrats only have one vote
should eliminate the filibuster
rule and so forth.
They're paralyzed.
To be honest they paralyze
themselves.
rid of the the the bogeyman of
this bill all this all this bill
does is convene the commission
they make recommendations to
rid of religion this commission
would never have that authority
we would never give that to the
commission what the idea of this
ammendment.
With the fifteen member.
Now let me suggest to there's
already some bipartisanship
built into this bill because the
appointments to all of the
appointments of the fifteen come
from Legislative Council.
bipartisan.
Committee.
And working very well together
in the best interests of the
Senate I hope this year will be
no different the future will be
no different but but the fact
don't I don't think requiring at
least one vote out of a minority
party.
it is a is a bad idea I think
it's a good idea.
want to congratulate senator
smitteez for doing something
that I failed to do which is
what this is in committee I
offered an amendment to make at
two thirds.
And and Senator committees you
you managed to strike a number
that that you got Senator on
discovery with.
and the and so while I'm finding
know what whatever product comes
out of the customs revision
commission when it comes to the
legislature it's going to be you
know it's a it's under the
need at least a firm twenty two
votes in the Senate and at least
a firm thirty six votes in the
house.
That committee by one party.
those though the rest of the
constitution is is amended by
majority vote of the voters.
And so the the additional
product should be a product of
some collaboration.
one of the reasons why.
I I do endeavor to carry bills
every year.
that cross caucuses is that a
And we just take a few words it
doesn't affect what I was trying
to get at and it and it actually
satisfies concerns on the other
side and that's and that's part
values of a broader swath of our
state so
Centers metes out my hat is off
to you for this amendment and
president I rise and full
support of the amendment
sitting through the discussion
and rules I was not supportive
of the two thirds I I thought
that Mr prisms of the body that
was a little bit hi I have a
members of one party in this
just insurers that there will be
at least one other voice that
will have to be heard in order
to make a suggestion but then at
the end of the day the the
Any further debate on the
amendment.
Senator Wirth.
You Mr president I
You know I support the
discussion for sure I just
It take I think it takes to
create has to be twenty two
votes I think in this in this
chamber and we're creating a
different standard for the
commission and quite frankly you
know we're gonna have a
I hate to see the commission.
You know propose a whole bunch
of things and and and.
My understanding from history
the last time the commission met
goal so I I just I think we're
kind of.
Putting an elevated standard
here that.
I just don't think is consistent
with what's in the constitution
was done before but just trying
to think this through so we get
one vote from the other side I
mean and we feel good about that
and it comes right back down and
You know centers around is the.
The way you put together the
make up of this commission and
how that's done I think the
think it's a healthy discussion
it just seems to me though that.
You know this is probably a
direction the next thing we're
gonna have and I think actually
center pirtle may already have
resolution for three fifths that
is exactly the point so I just
think as senator Here said.
You know the the constitution.
You know it's something that we
just a philosophical issue and
Senator Monday said it's
interesting we're having such a
debate on on on a commission
bill we passed many many times
again I think it is a good
moment for.
The Senate because this is a
discussion we should have thank
you Senator Wirth further debate
on the amendment Senator Sedillo
Lopez.
Thank you Mr president so the
idea is to at least get one of
the minority party to be on
board.
And what difference do you think
Senator the as as the four years
said the last time this that
this commission type of
commission of Matt was the mid
nineties things were less
partisan at that time I think we
commission for constitution and
then if you flip that eight
eight Democrats and seven
Republicans on the other and the
results of that work.
say this is a static document
the the other is going to kind
of say this is more of a living
document just are are are very
framework of of how
constitutional law is is seen
are you an original list all
partisan thing you know we we
shouldn't really do it doesn't
mean much and so here's really
why around the amendment to
answer a question Senator is to
suggests this the minutes I may
not say what the vote is
sometimes may not say would you
know what what happened and so
here with just a straight party
line will you you we we could
potentially do some harm I think
some harm to the public because
now they think this so suppose a
just asking for one more vote
because now you at least get
that that sort of spirit of
bipartisanship to to to match
the headline that might come out
what happens here and so
like I said I think the higher
the number goes
the the more protected it gets
from the partisanship but then
once again you get worried about
going in there to say we're not
let's not start with anything
this is hyper partisan Reno's
gonna be straight party line.
There has to be some spirit of
it and it's in statute so I I
know that the if if the goal is
little bit in that direction
let's put in statute to help
them get there thank you.
Senator Sedillo Lopez.
Thank thank you Mr chair will
Senator what is your vision of
what because when I look at this
is to review the findings of the
sixty seven commission the sixty
nine commission the ninety four
commission.
commission because what you the
only thing you mentioned was
updating the language which of
course you look at it it it does
it is a.
Your question goes beyond the
amendment I believe but but all
of all the address you're queer
question and try to put in the
context of the matter before the
chamber now.
Let me give you my best example.
Right now we have a constitution
this as we meet every other year
for thirty days and every other
year for sixty days.
And in the thirty days the only
things we can consider are the
budget and matters the governor
bill into that and we meet in
our committees and we and we
manipulate.
The thirty day session so that
we can try and fit within the
constitution yes that's what we
do.
doing this year and then thirty
days every other year for only
the budget and matters the
governor puts on the call.
What was the thinking behind
that.
On on on on my on my radio.
Because I'm very concerned that
I think I think our country is
devolving I think our democracy
believe that the reason they did
that is because what the laws
change too much too quickly back
in nineteen twelve.
And I think some of that was
probably just practical they had
to re print all of our statute
And so they said maybe we should
only change the big laws and all
these laws once every every
other year and and and and
that's only practical reason I
can think of for doing that.
We live in a completely
different than the for the
founders envisioned in nineteen
twelve and we and we should
adopt that change we should
way and I think right now there
are probably places we're not
doing that.
Thank you Mr president of will
think that three fifths will
slow down what this commission
does or will help with this
commission does.
I know that you're you're
agree what that means is not
much happens.
And what I just heard from the
sponsor is that he wants this to
be.
T. once New Mexico to be more
would put this the bottom line.
If this commission meets and
makes a party line
recommendation this bill is
completely useless and a big
I want this commission to make
you know I I don't want to be a
waste and so let's outlaw this
whole thing being a waste of
time and a failure I don't want
work and all they come back with
is a straight party line vote I
want to statutorily prevent that
from happening because by
see that the Mexican people and
that's all this does in so
asking for one more I I don't
think we'll slow down.
And and it once again this is
partisanship I'm tired of it and
I think that let's just make
this commission do something of
value for this legislative body.
is very clear they want to see
us move forward they want us to
see if they want us to to do
something dramatically different
from what we've been doing
aspects of the constitution to
me like article twenty section
twenty one which Sarah is turned
out to be.
people to protect our
environment our air our water
which as you know I have a
constitutional amendment
proposal to let this people
process down and less will
happened and the people's voice
will be.
Will not be of expressed in the
robust way it will be if it's
Si no further debate on the
amendment.
Senate committee to close I
think this president I think
I've said my my piece on the
amendment I think the body
understands what it does I just
think that at this time of hyper
vote comes down to is if a yes
vote on this amendment for me
means let's let's at least
require some kind of
bipartisanship some that's going
to mean something a no vote is
well let's still LFC apos the
move sent for member number one

remove their coats the no
objection members may be may are
permitted to remove their coats.
We're back on the bill we have
Senator Brandt.
center so my understanding is
this commission would look at
our constitution.
and then bring recommendations
back to the body it says they'll
have
that they would actually be able
chamber that have to have a
sponsor
What is that recommend I think
it's as recommended propose I
think the words propose I think
is in the bill I'm working off
memory things is proposed
legislation the commission
constitution that creates this
commission the recognizes
commission allows them to do
that.
Thank you Mr president
Senator
governor have appointees on this
commission.
Well.
Again it gets back to what I
Not because it came out the way
I would have liked that would
have been fine if I had gone.
The major wishes.
So I think that it's important
that the the the governor have
some participation is process
she's been elected statewide.
she was elected strongly by the
vote of the people and and I
had an amendment on the ballot
all reforming the PRC commission
it took the membership from five
to three you all know the know
the legislative I propose that
strongly I thought that would
by admiral pain as a co sponsor
with Majority Leader worth.
If I look at the instances we
have amended the constitution in
takes so so your point center I
think having the governor having
a role in input on this
commission is invaluable.
Thank you Mr president the and I
appreciate that I'm just I was
just wondering about it because
on their then takes your account
which was six six two being now
one political party but I think
the amendment we just passed
really help with that and so
to the people and so I was just
kind of wonder what thought was
behind that appreciate the
answer that.
This presents if I if I can
Thank you Mr president and I
don't know about anybody else
but because of this.
Legislation I decided I would
ourselves does an eight hour
work the day really belong in
the constitution or can we do
that through through the
legislative body article twenty
think most of us would agree we
don't belong in there that they
don't have a place and it's not
because of cancer a cancel
cultures just language that's
really not acceptable it's it's
released within a vote of of
being unanimous with the
recommendation to the New Mexico
legislature because sitting on
rules for nine years and going
through all these piecemeal
that we have that there would be
a governor for eight years that
couldn't that wouldn't sign a
piece of legislation that would
pass out unanimously so the
glad that we didn't end up
putting that in our constitution
because that is something that
should be done through the
legislative process and so
hopefully with this we can
identify some of those things
center participate followed by
Senator Griggs.
Thank you Mr president I just
have a couple questions for the
sponsor of the deal centers
meetings of the of.
Of the constitutional commission
be open to the public at is that
an automatic in anything we pass
here do we have to say that.
open meetings act in front of me
memorized but I believe the
breadth of our open meetings act
would require this commission
like I believe just about every
other commission other than
maybe the ethics commission
meeting of the this is a the
commission that would take input
from the public or have some
means for taking input for the
public.
Would be valuable to its I I
Mistras would embrace that fully
there are things certainly that
the public would think through
that perhaps the commissioners
might not on their own and and
frankly we haven't thought of
Well I think you know we can of
well one last question Mr
president Senator our our
elected legislators somehow
prohibited from being on this
meet.
Mr president are an excellent
question the bill the bill does
not preclude provided from
serving on the commission I've
been asked several times with my
the appointments and I've got to
believe Legislative Council
would be very hesitant to
putting one of our colleagues on
this commission and the governor
open public input or that they
have a
a website for where the public
could register its concerns
things like that that would be
make those recommendations what
do you think senator.
Senator I agree I think that if
we begin to try and get too much
detail about issues like go we
in our Legislative Council the
fact the fact we have leadership
of both parties their leadership
with a lot of experience in
commissions of this kind I'm
confident they will assemble
Thank you senator this panel
Senator Griggs.
Thank you Mr president and way
back in nineteen sixty nine I
had the opportunity to come up

there's a willingness among this

represent all of New Mexicans

governor when she reviews this
and she chooses.
Her three members.
You know our society right now
he's kind of split up a little
more light that.
And so I think that would be
that would be a good suggestion
and you work hard at trying to
find some.
Some approaches it'll make New
Mexico alternately better I'm
gonna stand in support of the of

there are

Mr president hundred megawatts
of solar would produce energy
equivalent to approximately one
percent of utility retail energy

and then of course going to

Number nine insurers just in
keeping with the the intent of

to number twelve this that they
do the same thing.

the all of that that oversight

Mr president of might a co

happy to thank you Mr.
What it does is that it insurers
that the community solar.
Is truly community in nature and
so the.
this is primarily a residential
not a commercial enterprise
and and so so what we do here is
that we we insure them that that
solar are either residential
retail customers or they are
small commercial retail
customers because a Senator
Stefanics was talking about
commercial retail customers so
so what other is this would not
be a Walmart's this would not be
the big box stores.
in other words at least sixty
percent will go to residential.
within within each of the
community solar facilities not
in the area statewide within
concept and said in his bill in
committee of an example of this
I'm thinking.
You know over there between our
districts right in our
neighborhood is the whole foods
have the solar plant solar
project right there
we probably could believe over
right into your district or how
to senator Thomas district also
is that what we're envisioning
I don't know how whole foods
would be classified my guess
says Hoffman town churches pry
classified as a large community
retail Representative largely to
is a defined term in terms of
regulation with the PRC.
And so and so but but we keep it
within that defined term of the
of the of us walk commercial
what kind of what that looks
like you know.
What a community solar project

veterans business preference and
you've referred to it as what we
do in state procurement.
Is this for state procurement or
is this for the installers and
Mr president no it would be

It was it would be using these
those.
Given those preferences in the
same way that are they are given
in the procurement code that
local business or veterans
business.
Mister president senator who is
giving this preference is it a
state agency or this bill
Senator so the I think Ross was
president a Senator Moores so
this is based on if you look at
page ten line for the bill does
based on the rules the
solar there would be a five
percent of preference for New
Mexico residents or ten percent
preference for New Mexico
this president and and and
senator Morris.
it would be it would be
unconstitutional.
To to require only New Mexicans

this is this is a contractor

My concern is that we're saying
a business has to hire a certain

all support.

If they have fifty people who

kind of a scenario where where
there could be only let's say if
what would happen is that if you
have thirty bidders.

of figuring out this is what
it's cost me to track all of

still have to do the work to to
figure that out and then the

the and the attention over all
of these these two amendments is
just to make sure that those who

that's part of the bill that I
need to wait on but certainly
the connectivity how you connect

recover reasonable costs for

you also have what senator do it
that that customers not only get

means leans but that in addition
to that and this is where it's

the PRC with regard to those
disclosures that the

almost anybody is currently in a
transition phase.
But this is the work of the P.
Garcia this is the kind of work
that the PRC does every single
day in terms of recovering costs
the PRC are we we anticipate
that not only does the PRC have
the capacity to do this but that
that capacity simply going to
grow as we go forward in this

with all due respect worry about

maybe they'll go build a farm
