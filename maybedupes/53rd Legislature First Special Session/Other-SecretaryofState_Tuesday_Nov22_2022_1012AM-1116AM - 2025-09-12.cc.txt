A second twenty twenty two and
secretary of state Maggie
Toulouse Oliver this morning we
are going about the process of
randomly selecting precincts for
our post election audit or check
of our voting machines to ensure
the accuracy of the at the count
in our election and this is a
process that we go through here
in New Mexico.
After every general election
we've been doing this since the
the law requiring this was
passed into law in two thousand
eight
and so do the math this is our
however many at post election
audit that we've been going
through I'm here today with
members of my staff as well as
our independent auditor from the
CPA firm of order Slotnick in
Santa
and so I'm going to take a
little time to just go over the
process so that folks who are
out there watching on the
internet can understand what
we're doing here today and then
what the next steps in the
process will be and then our are
firmer independent audit firm
will be going through the
process of the random selection
of the precincts they'll be
speaking a little bit about what
they are doing translational Act
those precincts so first of all
I think it's important for folks
to know that the number of
voting precincts to be checked
is based on a formula that is
set out in statute and that is
in section one dash fourteen
dash thirteen point two of the
at New Mexico election code
and every post election audit
following a general election we
are required to audit always
that the top of the ticket
either the governor's race or
the presidential race that our
offices and the closest
statewide elective office.
For this year the post election
audit or machine check we'll be
examining the.
Election results for governor.
For the U. S. house of
representatives both district
one and two.
And our closest statewide race
the Supreme Court justice race
position one.
the post election audit uses a
statistical method to check the
accuracy of the vote tabulators
used during the general election
by comparing hand counts of
select precincts to the machine
tabulated results so following
today's process when the
precincts have been randomly
selected to be tracked.
And following the certification
of the election next week by the
state or Candace.
The independent auditor will be
working with county clerks in
every county where precincts
have been randomly selected to
provide them with the process
and information as to how to go
about hand counting the results
for those races reporting those
results back to the independent
auditor.
If a significant discrepancies
are found additional hand counts
may be required pursuant to
state law.
And at we've never had that
happen here in New Mexico before
but it is part of the process if
necessary zero point zero the
entirety of this process is for
the purpose of ensuring that our
voting machines are tabulators
are counting election results
accurately and the point of
selecting them randomly just to
make sure that no bad after for
anybody with any mail intent can
know beforehand which precincts
are going to be selected.
So again to these random
selection process will be
conducted independently I just
want to get Santa Fe Santa Fe
CPA firm.
And my last sort of introductory
comments if you will this
process is vital for how
election administrative years
conduct their work and it's also
extremely important for the
public at large because it is
yet another way we prove that
our elections are accurate
transparent and accountable
thanks again for joining us this
morning and with that I will
turn it over.
Thank you
My name is Rick Santa I am with
Islamic in Santa PC a local CPA
firm here in Santa Fe.
We also have Kevin Brennan of
Brennan tax and advisory was
also a local CPA assisting in
this process welcome to the
public viewing for selecting the
voter precincts in New Mexico
which will require a hand
recount of the ballots from the
November eight twenty twenty two
general election.
The hand recounts are only
required for certain federal and
statewide races based upon the
margin of victory the purpose of
the hand recount is to determine
the accuracy of the voting
machine tabulators use
throughout the state for the
November eighth twenty twenty
two general election.
As mentioned earlier for section
one dash fourteen dash thirteen
point two.
A voting system check is to be
performed after the general
election all precincts in the
state of New Mexico are subject
to selection for the voting
machine check the various county
clerks will recount the votes
from the actual paper ballots by
hand which will then be
submitted to our office for
review and a compilation of the
results will be conducted at
that time we will issue a
separate report summarizing the
results of the recount.
New Mexico has implemented a
more vigorous system for post
election random audits of voting
machines to ensure ballots are
accurately counted and which is
intended to provide
statistically reliable results
hand tallies from paper ballots
from random precincts will be
compared with machine counts to
provide evidence that the
winners of races would remain
the same.
The goal is to make certain
there's a high probability that
errors will be detected if they
could alter the outcome of the
race.
The races that will be tested
are as follows based on state
statute.
U. S. representative district
one we will select five
precincts.
US representative district two
hundred north precincts.
Governor ten precincts Supreme
Court justice position one
thirteen precincts a total of a
hundred thirties seven precincts
will be selected based on the
outcome of the various federal
and statewide contests we will
roll dice as many times as
needed for the selections we
will use seven ten sided dice
numbers zero through nine which
are color coded the callers in
order of preference have been
predetermined as follows.
Dice one is red dice to is white
dice three is blue dice forest
black dice I is gray die six
this green dye seven is purple.
This will allow for the highest
number to be nine million nine
hundred ninety nine thousand
nine hundred ninety nine each
number rolled will be normalized
to fit within the range of the
ballots cast which are seven
hundred fourteen thousand seven
hundred ninety seven for the
general election with that two
thousand one hundred and sixty
three New Mexico precincts all
ballots cast with their precinct
in the state of New Mexico will
have an equal chance of being
randomly selected for testing.
We will now proceed with
selection of the precincts to be
recounted.
