The.
Representatives more.
The.
Good morning and members
this is you.
This is actually.
Combination
but this has been something that
myself and the speaker had been
talking about
since we were freshman and that
i.
And her friend
I tend ten years ago now else we
were freshman in this body.
We all know government
assistance is kind of.
Various programs.
It we're talking about how
people.
The.
A subsist.
Living.
Because.
Over that amount.
That's the name of the term the
cliff affected you lose all of
your benefits.
And the payoff isn't.
As I was as i've been an
employer.
Um i've had folk.
I've had others who have worked
for a lesser amount.
Continue working they they want
to continue to have the job they
don't want to lose the job to
somebody else.
And and it's for the same reason
it's if they earn too much
money.
So
I believe the answer to this.
Star.
People.
Be able to earn more money and
as they do maybe they lose some
benefits but not all their
benefits where it steps down to
where they can get to we're
really were they want to be is
full employment.
No longer this.
Glass ceiling.
That exists that keeps them
from.
Expanding their c.
The reason I brought this
forward this year it's not the
first time I brought this
forward but the reason I brought
this forward this year.
Is.
Conversations with folks and and
and with folks in the government
in this adminis.
The.
New mexico and seventeen other
states are right now.
Was that currently.
There is a push.
The.
And the reality.
The.
This memorial just says and
there's no prescriptive
language.
To.
Speaker.
And it's her breaking.
So I understand the ne.
I think.
The.
I think the only way and then by
the way.
When I was first married.
Would not have made it without
the help.
Now.
That is risking that is just
risking all the benefits that
you can get.
And so the reality.
I I think.
And in the cost of living as
different throughout the countr.
But because of that I think
there has to be a stairstep.
First off I think they need.
But then there needs to be some
sort of.
I think this will allow people
to cl.
And as what's happening right
now is creating generational
poverty because.
Children.
Are learning.
Through this.
Too much then i'll lose this.
If they see that there's an
advantage.
The.
What it should have been in the
first place as you said a.
So that that when a certain
amount is.
Portion or a percentage.
Whatever whatever.
Government help is b.
And it always needs to be that
they are losing less than their
gaining.
Otherwise there's n.
As as income goes up.
Thank you for that question.
Thank you for bringing this
forward.
I think this is one of the
hardest problems that our nation
faces.
Legislators here in the in the
legislature.
We are.
We pass bills.
That make it harder on new
mexicans.
We're not going to get.
Or debate but.
I'm glad you brought it forward
I think as legislators.
Like in my dis.
A lot of communities that
struggle.
To make it
because they're so small in
their sore rule.
And there's not any jobs creat.
These people that are born in
raised there.
They don't they don't hardly
have a choice but to go on the.
The.
So.
As we go forward and as we work
in this thirty day session.
You know we have to think about.
New mexicans across the board
and property in.
And homelessness and everything.
That we do.
Even though.
We're trying to save.
The.
Are you economy and trying to
look at global warming and
everything.
There's a balance.
I really don't have any
questions for you.
That it is something that needs
to be t.
And consider.
Our poverty are people that are
p.
Thank you for bringing it
forward I look forward to
supporting th.
Thank you representative for
bringing this bill I always tell
my constituents that.
When you can see democrats.
The.
So a manager representative
the fact that I see.
Working together on this idea.
Can agree is a real problem that
is non parison that that is not
read or blue but is just
straight up.
Had more ideas like this this
makes me so happy to see you
working together
I love it when I I always tell
people that if you want a good
example of of functioning
democracy.
It's like tennessee or others
and they're legislatures are
falling apart and I think yeah
we may fight fight like cats and
dogs every now and then but.
You know we all do.
Madam chair representative I
fully support this idea anything
that I can do that help with it
please let me know
more of this in this world of
hyperpartisanship.
And all of that psychological
stuff.
Sorry matter that it was on the
list I just wanted to say thank
you also for bringing.
The.
Like to say for all of us I
think we have to consider.
Not just.
Into change our perception a
little bit about calling.
It is multiple cliffs there is a
cl.
Cliff for and food assistance
and their.
You hit them at different points
and it's all complete.
Which also adds to the feeling
of hop.
I'm gonna point to just one
child.
Is four dollars an hour so even
someone I mean if we're gonna
talk about g.
On all of those cliffs mountain
that may only.
You could freeze.
Thank you madam chair and once
again this is house memorial
twenty five you are all welcome.
I think it's important for it.
Yeah.
Good morning madam charing
committee
this was worked for
representative monthly i'm gonna
start off the same way this is a
really simple bill.
Madam chair committee.
We have as as we're all wear a
list of committees that are that
are statue based we meet for
during the inner.
One of the we have a couple of
different subcommittees or task
force published good capital
outlay tax force but we also
have transportation
infrastructure and revenue
subcommittee.
That is not a required commi.
The purpose of this bill is
single fold.
Our state transportation are DO
t.
And we have a subcomm.
And so this bill does have a an
appropriation to it.
Which will be pulled after when
we go to the house
appropriations because it's
already in the budget.
The.
As hotspot one was was fed
through the the system.
Mister
legislative council service has.
The.
Transfer.
Once again this is the largest
second largest.
Yeah.
To the chair of our trans.
Thank you representative and I
also want to let the committee
you know I am the worst at
signing on to the bills that I
am supposed to sign on to but
never get there so please know
that my name would be on this
bill if I hadn't day hawkman be
held it and the instance
that madame her members of the
committee represented a pedigree
and I have been talking about
this since we were both shocked
to find out that we had to beg
to have a transportation
subcommittee.
This past interim
it's at basically the discretion
of the speaker and mister
barcelo.
And we had not there are six
transportation districts that
are stationed all throughout the
state it had been something like
over a decade since
transportation are since the
legislature had visited each one
of those transportation
districts when I was lucky
enough to be given the
chairman ship of house
transportation that was one of
my first objectives and the
interim was to take that take
the committee on the road so to
speak so that we could visit all
six districts talk to their
engineers see their roads look
what life is like for them from
an infrastructure of
transportation in infrastructure
perspective and I I don't want
to speak for the whole community
but I can speak for myself and
that I think it was tremendously
educational for all of us and
actually helped the shape the
cheaper agenda for the
legislative session this year
and we plan to do it again next
and term but madame chairman of
the committee what this bill
will do is this insurers that
representative pedigree and I
will not have to continue to beg
to have a subcommittee so that
we can go do our charge
essentially do your t has over a
billion dollar budget.
And my opinion madame chair
members of the committee it's
insane that it does not have its
own step statutory committee at
this point
and we're really just trying to
cannot protect the function of
the committee during the
interest so that we can continue
to do what we do and put
together a budget for dealt that
reflects the needs of the state
as seen by our.
Turn it back over to.
The.
Thank you matt of chairing
committee thank you
committee chair.
Atmondy hill.
The only difference between this
piece of legislation.
Is the appropriat.
Otherwise you would have a
committee.
The.
Thank you madame chairman and I
will be quick I do promise
unlike it through in the morning
on the floor but madame chair
representative
representative so I appreciate
the the bill and i.
I guess when I first
you know when we when we run for
election this is not a h.
But in my community madame
chairman representative there
are certain projects that I
really care about and they're
all relating to transportation
right that is like the bones of
the structure that we all sit on
the roads that keep us going
ensuring that there's not a
giant part hold that's going to
cost you a weak salary because
you have to buy for new tires.
Which has happened to me minimum
chair
and representative and you know
and during these interim
committees I drive around the
entire state and i'm not on the
transportation subcommittee but
if this does go and i'll put it
as an eighth committee on my
interim checklist and now I will
try to get on that madam madame
chair and the representative so
I just want to think both of you
for the claboration and like you
said
hochmen be hill earlier on the
last bill it's good to see
republicans in democrats being
able to work together on issues
that matter to everybody in a
rose should not be.
A crazy partisan issue and I
hope that they never are but I
truly appreciate it and
especially with the larger
billion dollar budget.
Thank you madame thank you for
bringing this bill.
I'm on a passenger and to
represent apartment be hill
because
continuously not invited up
there.
Thank you madame chair
representatives and where I have
spoken with you for the staff
danish legal about our need and
our wish to expand the
transportation interim the
governor's office was very
supportive of us when we went on
the road earlier this year I had
a sit down meeting with them
after we were done after we had
our last meeting and kind of
discussed all of the findings
with them because they are very
very interested in
transportation and
infrastructure madam character
and representative block like
you said this is our backbone
and I always told people this
too it's nice is non partisan
that's why I am lucky I get to
chair one of the best committees
around because I just all of us
care a lot about transportation
and we don't make it about
partisanship and that's why I
think we have a fantastic
commit.
I'm sure if we manage her asked
the government or directly would
you support this bill I I doubt
that they would have any problem
with that I can't speak for the
governor's office they probably
just don't know that we exactly
have brought a bill that we
intend to bring the bill but
happy to make a phone call if
that would turn some.
Thank you madame charles and
representative I look forward to
support.
No it's it's it'll be I think
it'll be good for the state and
and good for our districts
there's there's issues in every
district and I see him in my
district.
And some of them are big issues
that need to be addressed.
And I don't want anybody to get
me wrong or anything deal.
They do a good job they have
their their districts cut up in
a way where they can tend to ma.
The.
Only.
For them to help.
Thank you
thank you represent.
You know the first email the
first constituent email I got.
Was from a constituent who let
me know it is actually a very
long text message you open your
phone it's like the whole screen
and you're like okay here we go
informed me that he two days in
a row.
About half hour late and the
second day the bus didn't come
at all and he had to have a
friend.
I will you know absolutely be in
touch with the transportation
interim committee about this and
there was not one so
I
i'm excited to see this you know
we talk about infrastructure and
roads and that is all very
important because we have a big
state and there is a lot of land
to cover but in my district
which is densely urban we also
have on top of part halls which
we get to as well absolutely we
also have these issues of you
know people rely on our public
transport and when it's not th.
The.
Have to have.
He allows you to be forty five
plus.
Really ex.
Address these.
Quality of the road that they
have to drive or the weight that
they have to wait just to get.
Which is why.
There.
Like all other interim.
I'm I just.
Yeah I wanted to kick.
Better
of well
that one matter in by sure
actually
I appreciate the make up its
changed a little bit since when
I first came on board
we have very different.
By the time we get to our last
meeting.
Very few of the issues that we
bring.
The.
By partisan support and or an or
tone support with.
We'll add that chair home and be
hill brings a little bit
different perspective to the
transportation committee that we
have during session in also what
she d.
What's this respect to that and
I would suspect as a full
committee.
And during session.
We are.
Yeah.
Staffing and funding to m.
Um.
And in general I would say.
Well.
Us.
That's actually what I like
about this.
And that's important.
So this is.
What is cut out.
Why is it called.
My understanding subcommittees.
Madam chair.
I wasn't part of the.
Thank you chairman vice chair
it's my understanding that a lot
of this is very loose
definitionally and so I believe
we are a subcommittee supposed
to be a subcommittee or were a
so committee at one point one
point in time for lfc.
But we don't management chairman
victor we don't we never
reported to them we never I mean
the most we ever really did is I
tried to align our schedule with
lfc
for a few of our
of our hearings just so that we
have we have so many members
that are on the transportation
so committee that also serve on
lfc manager just to make sure it
made it as easy for them to come
to our meetings as well and
because we're there such a nexus
between the work that we do
madam chair and what lfc does
I I imagine that's probably
where that came from but again
that whole interim committee
processed beneficiary I don't
know if you guys some of you
will remember damage but he he
had I mean it was like his
mission till go through and
revised the the the interim
commanding process and I
actually think that might be a
good first time so that's I I if
you want more information on it
madam chairman vice chair and we
probably should go have a
conversation with director
bursiaga and also with pim
stocks to.
Pam knows everything inter.
Thank you madame.
Crucial throughout the.
Budgetary plans that we.
And you don't want to set up a
system that's going to.
So getting lfc and else yes.
There's I will go sign on.
Thank you madame.
The.
The.
Thank you good morning cheer
members of the committee.
The.
I know that covered politicized
this issue.
Our role is an equal branch.
Reality that we are the closest
to the p.
And currently they don't have a
say when.
And that's appropriate.
Up to a certain point and so th.
That to extend beyond.
Would have us come in the
session.
Good morning madam chair larry
sintag here on behalf of the new
mexico business coalition in nbc
strongly supports htr eight
because it will provide much
needed balance of powers between
the executive and legislative
branches when the original
legislation was created
providing powers to the governor
for emergencies such as this it
was following the nine one one
attacks.
While the legislation was well
intentioned is now evident that
there are critical efficiencies
that must be corrected to allow
for legislative oversight on
extended uses of executive
emergency authority.
This is sure is a better balance
of power between the two
branches of government and gives
oversight back to you the
legislative branch.
Hr would be submitted for a vote
to the people of new mexico and
the next general election which
is this year.
This is the perfect solution to
the issue that created
unintended consequences years
ago I urge you to let the people
of new mexico have their voice
on this issue.
And pass htr thank you.
Recording madam chair members of
the committee my name's paul
gaso good president of the real
grandday foundation and I urge
you to support this resolution
the people of new mexico data
government that is balanced
this is simply good governments
and having the legislature with
a seat at the table in future
health emergencies is absolutely
necessary ninety days quite a
long period of time quite
honestly I would might say that
short but this is a good
starting plate and something
that we would be fully
supportive of as it makes its
way through the constitutional
amendment process so thank you
and I hope you'll support it.
The.
And first I want to say that.
Yeah.
Incidents.
I like this because.
I I really like that.
Thinking forward.
Politicians always have comments
to offer so.
I don't it's not so much.
In all things.
So what's assumed that this
past.
And.
The voters.
Sure.
Bodies of our government and we
need to be involved in big
decision.
Madame.
The madame termin leader lane
thank you for this I just I
thought this was interesting and
I really like this portion of
the bill and pages two and three
it talks about what kind of
votes we would need in order to
overturn this kind of thing and
madame chair leader lane I see
that is three fifths of the
members elected the senate and
then three fifths of the members
elected to the house and so
madame chair representative
since no party has three fifths
of either chamber I think this
could potentially or this would
require
by partisanship is that correct
madame chair and leader lane
made of chair no
frankly the answer is no
it requires forty two.
You could have.
All right thank you
minimum share and
leader lane and so I think it's
let's just say there's a there
is a republican governor.
And there's a democratic house
and senate let's just say the
current numbers.
So this would bring a.
A balance of power I could I
could foresee madame chair
leader lane
and vice versa whether whether
we republican legislature or a
democratic governor
I would see that these numbers
are so high it wouldn't just be
a simple majority rate so madame
to leader link is that kind of
why we we chose this larger
figure to hopefully faster
collaboration.
And discussion I guess from all
the different districts across
the state.
Man sure yeah I mean so the
idea.
Is you know I think
fundamentally.
And I think again at how I
started the dialogue was covered
unfortunate fortunately has.
Right
and so I think we need a l.
To require a bit more th.
Thank you madame chairman and
representative and then my I
guess my other point I would
just like to put out there about
this legislation is I think this
could actually
not only be a check and balance
yes but it could send a message
to future governors when this
does go into effect to be very
deliberate when it comes to
their orders and if there is an
emergency then let's ensure that
we're using this in a way that
would make us.
Proud of the decisions that
we're making so madam chair and
leaderly and I appreciate this
legislation and I find it to be
be interesting to look forward
to the rest of the conversation
this morning thank you madame
chair.
Thank you madame chair members
of the committee and thank you
leader for bringing this forward
a look forward to supporting
this.
When we had our issues.
A lot of things were shut down.
And the agriculture community.
Some people didn't know.
Yeah.
Are rolling.
The.
They just.
And we had to go.
Back and make phone calls and
and get.
The.
And.
We got things done but it it
sure was hard for everybody and
I think as as a legislature.
We're here to represent our
people and bring ideas to the t.
The.
In a way.
The way they did through through
having though.
Figure out all these issu.
Balance government statements
are exactly that is is let's get
it right let's all work together
I look forward to supporting
this bill thank you for bringing
it forward.
And that's all the comments I
have manager.
And.
Yeah.
Health crisis.
The.
And they w.
Pragmatic about this.
For lack of a better word gated.
The.
And.
The.
How.
They were the loudest voices but
there were those.
Happening get the experts advise
our leadership and make the best
decision.
Yeah.
I could see.
The.
Input.
The.
To me it means.
The beautiful the beauty.
The.
I'm happy.
And that that's part of what
resulted f.
As it relates to and i.
That's experienc.
Must be aware of that.
Going to remind them that that
can't happen but I think that
th.
Experts to be the ones to make
this decision I believe there.
The.
Everything in my power not.
The.
But.
Thank you
highly.
Aware of.
Of of issues.
Of the urgency.
In our country it is very
important.
Thank you madam chair
you know
madame chairman represented
later lane one of the beautiful
things about this country.
The.
I understand.
The most important thing we do.
The.
Informat.
The.
In us is legislators.
The.
For expert witnesses.
We get it bring those peoples
into this capital.
And have those discussions and
then we can.
The.
Debate that or have a rebuttal.
So that are people have a sa.
In what.
What this is about.
This this bill had bipartisan
suppor.
The.
The debate on the floor.
About this bill and.
Madam chairman and lead.
The.
Was involved.
Either way we look at it it had
bited by p.
Name in and represent eli and
representative.
Issues are.
That we need to take answers b.
The.
And I I believe if you're
people.
The.
They wanted to some men put they
wanted to.
The.
Let the governor or anybody else
know of their needs.
And and representing th.
Near history that we.
The.
That this bill
passes this.
Input can be put into it what's
wrong with it what's right with
it.
I hope it doesn't get kill.
Thank you.
Managers I may get on the board
to speak.
Yes.
Thank you very much monetary and
I apologize again for having to
to be zoom right now but just a
couple of.
Statements about this joint
resolution madam chair I also
remember when this was brought
by now senator neighborhood and
reformer representative day many
life
and I remember
the exact debate surrounding the
bell I agree with the bill
sponsors matter of chair that
this is that this is a balance
of powers issue this is not a
this is not it or should not be
a democrat versus republican
issue
and man chair members of the
committee I always hold
representative eli that I would
be all for this bill however
madam chair I think just the the
specific suburb the ninety day
the ninety day deadline and the
two thirds majority I believe
matter of chair if you look at
what just happened with colbed
does not installate the process
enough from politics
unfortunately
not sure if you'll if if this
had been in place
during cobid this I truly
believed that we would have
resended the state of emergency
probably well just in the summer
when some of the numbers were
the highest and as many of you
know manager are very close
member of my family I almost
died of cobited in october about
year.
And i'm sure members of
committee I would definitely be
up to to consider this but I I
just think that looking back at
the experience we just had this
bill would not have protected us
in fact I think it would have
hurt us as the state further I
do not think we would have met
the two thirds of major party
again madam chair because of
politics
and I I think that the emergency
order would have would have been
rescended and so i'm again
manager I agree with the basic
premise of the house choice
resolution the legislature is is
it's own body we need to start
our own power and process when
it comes to states of emergency
I agree with that premise of
hundred percent
however madam chair many the way
the bill the joint resolution
joint resolution is drafted now
I still think it doesn't inslate
us from that the problem with
politics and I would be very
happy now i'm chair.
Members of the committee bill
sponsors to to work with you
guys are continued to work with
you to try and find something
that you know might again but my
fear here is insulation from
partisan politics which are as
we all know madam chair does not
belong anywhere nearer issues of
life and death like a health
emergency so
as it stands on i'm sure I I
cannot support the bill
unfortunately but I would be
more than happy to continue the
dialogue and
as a democrat work with the
sponsored of the bill to
continue to maybe find just the
right balance or something like
this because the legislature
does need to assert itself and
matter such as these thinking
manager.
So to to be cl.
We're afraid.
That politics might interrupt.
We choose politics.
Especially on because we were
all.
The.
As you look at the.
And if that was the heart of
this I would have made it two
thirds and it's not this is
about getting the people of new.
Yeah.
Yes.
Representative.
Rare.
The.
Yes.
Thank you madame chair.
And members of the committee
uh before you house joint
resolution nine.
This driver resolution
is proposing an amendment
article four section five of the
constitution in mexico to
provide that each regular
session of the legislature shall
not.
It also removes restrictions on
bills that may be considered an
even number years and provides
for c.
Even during special.
Madam chair and members this
bill has there's another bill
work that is also in the works
that looks very similar to this
um and it h.
By partisan and by camera
support I actually thought it
would be heard before mine I
didn't realize.
But this is something that I
have carried for several years
now
this bill for this resolution.
What it what it will do is
remove restrictions madam chair
from things that can be entered.
During a second or an even
numbered session.
And there are many benefits of
this that I would like to i'd
like to discuss today
one of these benefits is
especially for new legislators
during a first session.
Many times new legislators don't
understand.
And that they uh that their
ability to get a bill past is
very limited during a during a
sixty day session.
They they get elected in
november they've not had the
opportunity to take part in
interim committees they've not
had the ability to get a bill
vetted and uh in and maybe get a
committee referral and so when
they get in during the session
especially if they're
representing a community.
Is looking for some help that
needs to be in the appropriation
and house bill too.
They don't have the ability to
do that then the second year
comes along and
they have a thirty day session
people who have been through
that before have a natural
advantage because legislators
who have been through that know
what they need to do and how
fast a thirty day session goes
and it put it makes four years
for a new legislat new
legislator.
To be
I hate say but almost irrelevant
during their first two years as
an elected official.
So
if we were to be able to expand.
The second year the thirty day
session to a forty five day
session.
And it were to remove
restrictions that being that it
has to be either on the
governor's call or it has to be
only a budget issue it allows
for legislators who are in their
second year of their freshman
term the ability to get
legislation past.
What this would also do is for
first for the last six years for
the previous six years
I had been in leadership in the
house.
Minority office.
And hiring staff is very
difficult during a sixty day
session it's a lot easier during
a thirty day session but from
session the session it's hard to
keep a staff
staffed
it is a sixty day session is
very hard for legislators but
it's really hard for for
analysts.
So this would even it out it
would also help us to have maybe
a consistent.
A staffing for the session.
For each session and uhm madam
chair it would remove
restrictions from all members of
both parties from having a.
And even yeared session that is
very hard to do anything at all
without approval from the
governor this in my opinion
madam chair would.
Take back to some agree
seat at the table as legislators
who are supposed to be able to
represent our communities.
It makes it very very hard.
To be able to get things done
that are important.
The.
And once again from either party
unless you're in the good favor.
Of th.
With that.
Madam chair what asking this
bill has at this resolution in
the past i've had i've been able
to get this all of the way
through our.
Through our chamber to the
senate where we've had further
discussions on this.
There is a lot of
bipartisan support.
For changing.
Things up there have been
discussions as to whether this
is the exact vehicle or not the
exa.
But
I I believe if we put this to
the public I think the public
would see this as friendly I
think the public would see this
as a
vemb being able to have
representation that is equal
every year instead of so on
equal
and I don't mean.
The.
The majority part.
Legislative authority versus the
administration's authority and
it were it would allow for us to
to be able to fully represent.
Our voters.
Continually.
So with that madam chair I stand
for que.
It's going to be one of my
questions why are we do pl.
Madam chair i'm not exactly sure
I I didn't read that one fully
through i'm not sure if it's
exactly the s.
Okay and did it pass out of here
well i'm i'm actually surprised.
That that other
build went through.
Initially or what it was
presented that I wasn't ask.
The.
What I would ask madam chair if
that's already passed out of
here i'd like to get this passed
out of here and I would talk
with the othe.
Combination of efforts already
in june.
Another resolution.
Rather than.
I think you madam chair I
actually think if I were to get.
I'm not sure why.
I'm just little surprised I
would I I if we can pass the s.
And sponsor
both of the othe.
To our.
Chambers and go to the voters.
And and the voters choose it it
would.
Before we get.
The.
This current str.
Has lasted for the la.
It is not going to see.
We have to build the structure
that will last.
We can devote.
To get in on the modif.
Madam chair and and represent
figure of
we also have before us what is.
Full time staffing.
Or not full time stepping full
time to pay legislators not full
time but pay legislators.
For their service madame chair
and representative figure out
what I
see out of that is that we could
have a much more robust interim.
Where bills are actually that it
rather than what we have
currently.
Is a series of presentations.
By folks who have concerns.
About certain issues and then
ideas are presented but not very
many bills and lancare what I
think we could do.
Is we could expand if this.
If this format were in place we
could expand during the summer
and fall in the lead up to a
session.
More
focused efforts as a as a
legislature.
That would then result in bills
that would be that it prior to
each forty five day session and
then what we would not have is
what we have right now is the
first several weeks of the
session or are I I don't mean to
say wasted but we spend a lot of
time with pump and circumstance.
And we don't really start our
real business until.
Most the time two weeks into the
session I think we can get our
work done we could be more
efficient if we did that so
thank you venture.
We just made a statement.
And I guess we should.
Yes ma'am.
Yeah.
Madam chair i'd like to make a
motion to reconc.
Now has.
Member.
And that is currently
in the legislature so we have.
Issue.
The most appropriate.
And manager can I propose maybe.
I I don't want to.
To ta.
The.
Represent hockey be hill.
Perhaps we can.
On wednesday and just port up
for a quick.
We.
Good morning mountain
committee once again
my expert with me is joyous.
And and how joint resolution
thirty.
Is pretty simple because
flashing.
In the purpose of this
legislation is.
Because of what's happened in
twenty twenty two.
Canny salaries passed both
houses.
As conversations we've had
earlier today or other
representatives sitting here
have had to day.
When you do something in in your
rookie time frame you don't
always understand all the rules
in a fight and known
what I was doing at the time
that I pat that we passed this
legislation.
That.
For a twenty plus years
legislation to allow the
counties to make their own
decisions.
Get paid.
Has passed unanimous.
House joint resolution is a.
It's life through flew through
this committee continue should
fly through.
The.
Another piece of legislation in
this jr with respect to the
stuff very same thing.
This allows the counties.
The.
We have a st.
Will determine.
Not really sure why that.
County salaries have no impact
whatsoever.
When we
we can pre empt on canada's but
we can't preempt.
I'm not sure why.
This piece of legislation
when it passes through the house
in the senate will go to the
voting members.
Voting residents in the.
They're not counting should be
able to.
Not be making that decision.
An entire legislator.
Vote unanimous.
Manager and committee with that
i'm gonna ask most misresponds
to
give her comment.
Members of many we are very
grateful that the sponsor
brought this forward this is
something for the past twenty
years that i've been at the
association of counties we come
before you roughly every three
or four years and ask for an
increase to the cap
as he mentioned in twenty twenty
two I passed the house in the
senate unanimously and was the
pocket be tote last year it
passed two house committees
unanimously and was not
scheduled on the house floor
this is something that's always
been by partisan and we clearly
think that now it may be being
politicized a bit and we find
that very disconcerting the
raise to the cap only allows the
commission to set the cap under
that it's it's something that
still relies on the county
commission to make the
determination on what they can
afford based on their budget
every time we've gone out the
fact that it wasn't approved
means that county officials have
not had an increase since twenty
eighteen when you look at the
increased costs for the health
insurance you look at inflation
this essentially means they're
making less than they did back
in twenty eighteen in fact we
have twenty seven county deputy
officials that make between
forty and fifty thousand more
than the electeds this is
becoming increasingly
problematic it means that it
makes it really difficult to get
candidates to even want to run
when they're going to see that
type of a pay cut we have
fourteen counties that are
currently at the cap and every
year we've come before the
session many legislators have
said why does this exist and we
can't answer that so we did ask
for we had companion bills in
the house and senate the house
did determine it which remain
the senate did not at that point
we decided that a resolution to
change the constitution made the
most logical sense of course
there would need to be some
statutory changes next year in
the session if it should pass
the voters but we certainly
think that it should reside with
the voters to determine whether
or not this still belongs in the
constitutional with that which.
Madam chair and.
Double finding people to run for
this kind of low pay.
We have trouble fighting people
to run for this kind of noba
we've also had the conversations
about.
The constitution gives the
legislature this.
This authority around
cannot give up legislative
power.
We can put it before the people.
And this is an example that I
agree.
One comment I think you might
have an uninte.
The.
In the research that I have done
around compensating salaries for
legislators when legislators are
in charg.
They are very very.
Perhaps even lower than what our
county folks are seeing now.
Their electorate right and I
don't want to do damage to these
future salaries right now they
can just say all of the state
sets ca.
So that that may happen.
But I still.
I think.
The statutory.
Faster way to get at this.
Representative yes ma'am.
Thank you madame chair and thank
you committee for coverners move
this forward
madame chairman before we gave
out I just had a question about
the friday meeting I looked at
the committee report on house
memorial seventeen and the one
that I looked at online it says
that I voted yes for it and
chase he voted no one which was
not accurate so I just want to
see if we could bring that to
the speaker's attention I know
we already approved it on the
floor.
It was house memorial seventeen
from representative charges.
That's correct.
Yeah.
Okay thank you manager I just
didn't want to bug you on a
sunday.
