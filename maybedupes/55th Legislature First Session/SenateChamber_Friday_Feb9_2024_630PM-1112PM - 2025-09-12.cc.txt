Thank you mister president
at the request of senator period
to get a marker i've been able
propose a council service
doesn't like to do at this way
so
that I took them into it just so
that we can really see what
changed in the interim and then
i'm going to propose so
the paid family medically vacced
creates a fun that will be
it's a secretary street and I
air from work for solution
department and trace to make
daniel from southwest women's
Oh they're they're right there
already.
Secretary welcome to the
chamber.
Center stewart thank you mister
president so
senate bill three set up the
paid family medically
available to workers who need to
take time away from the
workplace for specific cars of
leave
the fund will be financed by
every thousand dollars of wages
for employers employers with far
with fewer than five employees
Those employers that are not
paying in make up sixty six
percent of our work force
they make up only nine percent
of the work force.
Pete firmly a medical leave
legislation which is in.
reduced to turnover costs for
employers
as when you either have a baby
and want to stay home with said
or you have a seasection and you
if small businesses and large
businesses have these kinds of.
Programs they reduce turnover
not in the work force in part
because we don't have paid
family medical leave the us
department of labor their
women's bureau
Work for us participation in
rural economy is important about
one third of new mexico
insurance and working for small
employers that can't of ford
private paid family medical
leave and do not meet the
expert witnesses
for those who take that paid
family medical leave to manage
their own health condition there
are more likely to receive care
labor force altogether
access to pay leave during post
pardon period it's associated
with reduced utilization of snap
pretty high bar to get that paid
medical leave you have to have
doctors excuses you have to have
so there is a very intense
application process and you must
meet the criteria or you don't
get this it's a little easier to
have notices from your medical
providers
some issue present something
very exciting as happened over
the last three weeks and that is
that my
Both have met for the last three
weeks with representatives from
the business community
but roblack was in the earlier
discussions former repson of all
which I support so I am going to
be offering a an amendment for
that and I have been working
also with center chose of
survantes
So before I go to that cause I
think they're passing it out
right now let me talk about a
considerably last year we've
added a requirement for new
mexico department of work for
solutions to contract with it
qualified actual firm to conduct
session there will be a year
almost two years before the fund
will start collecting fees from
one twenty twenty seven in the
almost two years before then we
will have rule making and we
will have education and we will
any premium increases at point
one percent of wages per year
and we've added a requirement
We have clarified that leave
available for bereavement
following the loss for child
it's only available if that
chose under eighteen years of
employers who have a waver and
their employees are not required
to pay premium contributions
and we've added requirements
application they file an
application for leave
and there are proved if they
above minimum wage when they're
on leave this comes from the
fund not the employer who can
we have a cap and also on
contributions we want people to
take the leave to get well
ticket over having a baby to
bound with that paper and go
back to work
in time it's a thousand dollars
and fifty six forty six thousand
forty six
so mr present at this point in
Senate floor amendment number
one to senate build three as
amended amendment sponsored by
senator mimi stewart center
store to move and explain the
amendment
explain what your memories so
over this last three weeks where
I worked with representative
serado and rips chancer through
their work through the business
communities we are offering very
tell you the the biggest change
for me is that instead of twelve
weeks for both a family and
medical we have separated them
for medical for two years during
those two years we will look at
solvency of the fund and
determine if that can go up
after those two years it will
number of days the workers need
to work for company before their
offered job protection the
current bill it's ninety days
with the amendments it'll be a
and you're in the hospital it's
kind of hard to give twenty days
but if you ever heard a
technical in the hospital you're
not getting medical leave then
anyway you have to go through
the application process even
So for my amendments number one
number three number five and
number nine all deal with the
employee leasing contractor so
the employee leasing contractor
is the one that will pay the
contribution on behalf of their
My member number two adds a
definition of application year
application year means that
twelve month period beginning on
the first day of the calendar
on the bill requires that you
can't get any more than twelve
weeks in your application year
so when you apply that's when
nashville this summer to talk to
states who've already put this
in place and they made really
good administrative suggestions
which we have incorporated
Amendment number ten in eleven
change the length of leave
available for medical leave and
solved in the third year of the
program or when the fund becomes
solvent the amount of leave will
increase from nine weeks to
amendments number fourteen seven
thirteen move carrying for a
family member with a serious
metal condition from family
a family member we also have to
separate that out because now we
have two tracks we have the
family track for paternity and
maternity and we have the
solvency and then at the end of
that we will determine if we can
go to twelve or if we have to
stay at night.
this is the amount that
financially solves he will reach
if after the first year you've
got a hundred and forty percent
of what you have the first year
and running at the funds starts
paying back the state for the
thirty six million that we need
to start the program so in six
years that will be paid back to
a state.
here with calendar year with the
definition of application year
we wanted to make sure we had
two terms application year or
questions thank you center is
where debating sent a floor
remember number one.
Anyone wishing the debate.
Senator neighborhood.
Looking at paragraph e.
That would be ten e.
It says that the employee or
department determine how the
paid leave is to be
utilised.
them you know think of someone
with uh radiation or
chemotherapy they may need to
leave at three o'clock on one
day and be out the next day
application but that issue of
when the leave is taken
can be worked out through the
employer
so mister president in
that interaction that you talked
about or the finding of the
department.
Is that correct.
mister president up in paragraph
d
it says
twelve
Mister president senator this
just says that you can't get any
kind of leaves for more than
another three months at the
beginning of the next year
that's why we moved away from
calendar so this just requires a
this just stipulates that no
leave first and then there might
be medical complications so we
wanted to ensure the twelve
weeks was the maximum no matter
what they had in that
application year.
other provisions in this bill
finished or so mister president
in an application year
once we adopt the amendments if
have another three weeks that
you could use.
Mister president thank you for
their clarification that's the
questions I have.
Thank you center library we do
Thank you very much chair
i'm gonna catch up a little bit
i'm sorry I would be home.
My my problem.
Is is probably under g where it
says employee leasing contractor
had a
headquarter go around.
Oh no with workers comp.
On a.
Chili pickers.
Name a clarify if i'm wrong.
A contractor that provides ease
mister president senator
employee leasing contract to
refer to the temporary agencies
that higher people and pay them
contractor who will pay for the
employer's portion not the
employer that hired them from
the least in company that's what
this refers to.
company they were saying well we
need to figure out who has to
curious these employees on
workers comp insurance you know
you know it was are contention
worth with the worker comp when
we were talking about this that
the guy that supplied those
workers.
But at that time workers come up
and registration said oh no.
It is.
now workers compub will have
that labor contract whether to
pick and challenge or what it
madame protester stewart mister
president
mr senator
doesn't change anything having
to do with workers comp now
saying this does not relate to
this question mister president
and madame proteo is because I
thought workers comp is going I
mean work for solutions was
going to administer this program
is that not right this work for
do not administer workers comp
though workers comp commission
administration administers that
not work for solutions.
energy so the workers can't been
administration is not under work
for solution to whatsoever it's
a different agency is that right
mister president and baron
that that does use contract
labor in that way so i'm asking
this question mister
cattle now they consider as
independent contractors now
how is this going to affect them
whose it they're going to be
president and madam protempted
mister president.
Self employed workers and self
employed contractors can opt
into the program.
come to administration they they
was very selected they said well
if you work for certain percent
of the time for someone then
you're actually unemployed them
cattlemen in my area that had
that higher a lot of cowboys to
watch cattle out the past years
and that's going to help that
claim through a leasing
agreement so
explain explain that a little
bit to me I I think I get the
I need a tractor driver my
neighbors got a track to drive.
I tell him well let me
pay his wages.
would all whatever needs to be
old marine protein.
What mr president first of all.
You have to pay into the phone
Scratch that so you have to
have paid into the program
before you can apply
if you watch our protection with
an amendment that we're going to
about just a few days i'm just
not sure
what that what that means if
you're if your pan somebody for
a couple of days to common and
do your farming or run a tractor
know social security all of that
he would continue to do that.
Case he's the regular employer.
Okay so words it i'm sorry
with holding taxes on the
employee or the
required to pay this m or so and
hold for the social security
with all for the
fighter all that stuff this is
just another place you're gonna
have to was hold
is what i'm assuming mister
so that would be more like
social security taxes mister
president is is that man proteal
center store i'm mister
president it is you know it's an
people are care taking for you
who have to stay out of work or
it's for people but women who
have babies who want bond with
that babies or get over a
seasection we certainly want the
Cynerwood
thank you.
Madame pro talma I guess another
question I would have if that's
the case.
Um.
rs i've got to turn turning in
ten ninety nine so I got it if
it's AAA small employee
otherwise i've got a keep at
track of those things and turn
Um it is you know a little bit
here a little bit there and
finally you're laid here late
there and all of a certain
europe side now here you're you
able to be done without an
account or have you got any idea
on that mister president and
madame prodi.
Oh mister president senator
after talking with secretary
narrow it'll probably a
quarterly filing like everything
else and it'll kind of be a box
to check depending upon how many
you we aren't going to take time
in the next two years to make
this as easy on businesses as we
can we're going to have a small
she's committed to doing the
best job we can with this to
make this be is easy as possible
I think it's pretty easy now to
pay your five percent or so
that I agree with that
that it also costs me something
to pay the accountant or here's
services.
So it's it's going to be a cost
even above.
and I know that
best life right it would tell me
how someone will
wages go up time goes up
somewhere also but that's
that's gonna what we do in the
state.
Is is.
Burden our business man.
My business man.

be in texas oklahoma colorado.
you know we spent quite a bit of
time
with dot

A
drop you know uh drop exist all
ideas there's no when a train
comes well all commerce stops.
it looks like maybe it can
happen but
it also is going to affect the

is going to be pretty tough you
know there's a big discussion on
exactly where to put that bridge
because.
This contacts on those

but because of that progress and
business men are going to go out

And it's always a shame when we

Or.
So
am having some trouble thinking
about that and getting my head

Have you talked and state
personnel office.
I'm not sure he knows the state
each agency has an hr
representative
and that hard representative is
a one net that classifies
employees.
right off the top of my hand
two thousand classifications can
you imagine trying to put people
in two thousand classification.
I need to hire that or both
their

pretty man a bit another
classification he's got his god.
for but but the environmental
sector is.
There are his employees nated

He said they had done a study.
That they had talked to the

And the union was put in a

With trying to figure out the
classification system the the

figure out
California texas arizona are
everywhere round to try to phone
so that we can get the mid point
and redo our classification
Now you know and I know.
We're probably not one payment

But.
and I know that this is this is

know every time we turn rounder

And it's either where we can't

The.
And your pertinent this will put

the question would be
what is the income tax

as as they are off on leave like
On the amendment in apologize on
that uhm.
thank you for the opportunities
madam protein thank you for the
anters and i'll get back to you
thank you.
They said it was we are still on
the question on the amendment
really comes employee leasing
arrangement.
I know that we're talking about
attempt service here at least I
employee leasing contractor for
the contractor to provide least
what that goes around in circles
plus people lease cars and
houses in they don't lease
people.
politically correct me and I
thought somebody would come up
and say we don't really lease
people because we don't own
people I can lease a house
because I own a house I can
lease a car because I own a car
five years nobody's going to
understand that they're going to
wonder what the heck we're
doing.
The.
And I know that's the amendment
we don't know people so we can't
lease people.
Thank you mister president of
the sponsor the amendment please
yield center stereo deal of
course thank you senator hurdle
thank you miss president I had
no doubt that you would
care provider and then strike
lines nine through twelve a
strike thirteen up to the period
and then when I read that I
notice that paragraph e and b
specifically with with the
employee their self and so i'm
just curious why we don't want
to have that verification for
the family member so that the
Being a center per l center
mister president and senator so
we've we've removed this here
because it it confuses between
after individual insert or a
family member.
paragraph is for medical
understand that but I didn't
quite catch what paragraph as
for.
So missed president
are you looking on the pink
original bill I i've had found
it in the in the pink draft
spots it's going off of the
amendment
for I guess lack of confusion by
think I managed to do that
anyway so it would be page
The.
A mispresident center i'm to

put it in in the paragraph it

Seen no further debate on send a

show of hands.
Thank you senators to your seats

The reader to read the amount.
amended amendment sponsored by
senator joseph servant this in
her servant is to move and they
explain the amendment thank you
mister president members of the
senate and the second floor
private sector employers and
with concerns about
various items that they are all
encompassing this proposed
second floor amendment so the
first category of the five that
floor moment number two to
senate bill three as amended
repeatedly.
See no objection thank you if
you'll explain them as sender
thank you mister president i'm
sorry got ahead myself the for
leave a this was a leave
category as with the other leave
they would have entitled
benefits to those on active
military duty or impending call
would be eliminating an eight
hour minimum pink mental
requirement the version of the
bill as it exists without the
amendment would require that
anybody who takes leave has to
to meet the required leave so as
opposed to requiring they do so
in eight hour increments this
amendment would eliminate that
the third category of of the
those circumstances aware that
such notice would not be
required but again this is
intended to benefit employers so
they have that twenty eight
notice in advance
at least six months of
employment before that job
position would be guaranteed
it's called job protection I
think is the term that's being
used to describe this but under
this would require an employee
to be employed for at least a
hundred and eighty days with an
employer before that job
protection would apply.
And the fifth category was will
all that advisory committee this
would take that down to eight a
smaller number and simply
prescribe that four of the of
advisory committee members would
be selected by representatives
committee in having equal
representation of employees and
employers in that process and so
mass mispresent members the
senate all sent for questions on
I think mr president this is
another set of amendments that
uh
represent channel and represent
serato worked out with rob black
out park other members of the
business community.
the amendment would yield center
savantus dear yield yes
so mister president arm I
appreciate on on the bottom of
their sudden item number twelve
representatives of employees
where do these who decide to the
four r.
Senator surrounded miss
president in center is a is in
deferred to the sponsor about
the sponsor wants me to deferred
her senators to a deal thank you
mister president so the
secretary work for solutions
will pick these for her advise
street committee.
or by the governor's own
personal little self
he see whatever is the soul
arbiter on who's an employee er
and who's an employee
now we've said the executive
gets to pick and decide who's an
employer representative and
who's an employee representative
Without any oversight from us is
that correct.
Simply share that to the moment
change or it was the same as
this amendment in terms of who
would make the selection so the
original bill still has the
secretary of work for a solution
making the appointments the
amendment doesn't change that
representing adoptive and foster
parents or had to be a member
representing unpaid family
caregivers etc there's not do
the little of of a specified
second is that there is equal
effort and effort to show equal
representation of employers and
employees where the original
bill without this amendment
ultimately the secretary would
have that discretion under
either the amendment or the
original bill.
Senator share so mister
president in and i've i've
no longer on it now that mean.
We bring it back to life mister
president.
that advocates for women and
girls at representative that
advocates for individuals fifty
years of age or older state
certainly I believe the medical
society
how would they fall in that
would they be
if if if the government are
decided to know I really want to
want a medical provider on this
and employee representative or
an employee err representative.
Thank you center survived in
center city two missed president
and senator
so the secretary
e representative without is that
how that could work or would
work.
Senator servant mispresents
their occurred and and again I
think we can all think of
examples where a medical
so an individual could be one of
the other and again that'll be a
case specific decision made by
the secretary okay so then
mister president if I noticed on
then then what can we do to
correct that as the legislature
or I is an individual
how how would I bring that up
and see this doesn't appear fair
on there
really appears to me to be an
advocate for employees.
And
how how would we how would we
address that.
Either in this body or in court
or
however
thank you
enumerated representatives
you'll see really what their
authority is in the the point of
the advisory committee is to
provide input so uh the
implementation and problemation
identify an individual is
associated with one category of
representation of the other in
any one individual could
represent various interests out
somebody could argue that I
favor one of those professions
over the other but I I hold all
those titles.
They get centers around the
center so mister president so
efficient and timely development
implementation prologation of
rules in educational materials
to carry out the provisions of
the paper.
So we have another let me of
things they're supposed to do
This program in other parts of
the world of the country yet
there's nothing in here to say
that a promulgation of rules
which I think is I think that's
are not really in the in the
insurance business or in any of
that kind of business ends I e-
the way the way it's in the
original bill
knowledge or expertise on what
to do here
so the
so all of them.
But that somebody's gonna live
on the fourth floor or in the
governor's mansion everybody
down below will do what they're
in so I would I would like to
see
Ideally somebody in the
insurance world that knows how
right now we have a little of
people that may or may not know
what's going on and now we've
got
two set of people that may or
may not know what's going on so
that it thank you thank you
center chair.
Any further debate on center
floor amendment number two.
do so as a business man probably
most important really is
amendment number ten for a
business owner which would
provide that before an employee
for quite some time because of
what it may cost me I think any
employers going to be worried
about what it may cost them and
there's a great deal of unknown
there but i'll tell you as a
business owner the more
small business owner to leave a
position open guaranteed to do
so this amendment assures that
the employee has to have worked
for the business for six months
before they can be guaranteed
taking care of a new morning or
family members something else
they've worked for me while
they've invested in me and i've
invested in them and yes i'll
hold that job open for the for
them because they work for me
two senate bill number said bell
three as amended do now pass and
ask for a short house thank you
senators where voting tears
seats
if you wish to vote no please
raise your hand.
But I have a would affording the
affirmative zero the negative
senate floor amendment number
two as passed the senate
presenting that you must make I
remain with I contact with the
chair.
This reminder to all members
singer
request or jack is to be
removed.
Seen no objection.
You may remove your jackets they
just said it was others thank
you.
You are on the bill
okay now.
So
maybe I need some explanation
Centered center justice her
answers to you yield yes mister
president sorry center would
thank you very much mister
president I know you were in a
the well it read into this
amendment
that was put on before the
essentially the one I have in
context here.
griggs who would suggest that
the advisory commission may need
to get predium and I think he's
looking for something to do
after the senate so
mister president we we can get
maybe one of those I don't know
moment so they they were all
worked out together again this
was a great deal of work put in
by the sponsor and others in the
house with representatives of
various business associations
senator woods will that's that's
good
I assume that that was a gaze
but sometimes we amend at one
time one way and then we mend it
Okay thank you sir so I guess my
question
will be uh
I do like the part about foreign
for
mister president if you've ever
been in a labor negotiation but
i've happened to said in two
hundred two
uhm
down to a pretty good certain
rules here
but
there are still some things some
things like
you know.
as.
You know where was it I saw the
just a minute ago while I was
reading this about what is
to notify employer and
then that some of that kind of
stuff mister president uh madame
notify your employer that uh you
need some time off
center store mister president
senator you know that's an easy
question to answer if you're
it sees section is happening
but for the medical it's just
harder
I think it was last year that
that if you're pregnant
uh it's hard to do it a few had
a huge medical issue but we want
the employer and the employee to
Seller would think he's
interested in center woods I
guess the other question I have
uh in it brought it up as silty
and became a guaranteed employee
what what right would a employee
er have in dismissing an
There are still so mr president
you can far them for any reason
except for taking leave.
Senator woods
because nearly anything you do
you they could say well you did
this because I was off.
So
to be asked to to look ahead
for an employer.
That.
You know.
we're going to have a reduction
enforce
you know we don't have materials
to do this job who can actually
slam down the workforce.
And our worry about that concept
right there
under this bill.
And I don't know what
guy heard
uh a labor he hired a milk or if
he was a derryman he hired
was cutting down his workforce
so
tell me tell me how you envision
this to work if he is if an
to go home and tell my employers
because.
There's many jobs that not less
reserve.
my problem here.
Thank you center word center
stewart mister president yes I
see it
one of the reasons for i'm
but if you have a company that
has to do to mass lay offs that
has nothing to do with someone
taking leave you can't fire them
if they take leave but you can
I don't know missed president a.
Look at the room that I see that
Yeah they can't lose your job
then yet it may very well be the
circumstance you're no longer
need.
And so there's one pouring a
As to how he may be maybe that
is what the rules are going to
show a never thought of that
mister brezed in maybe that's
what these eight people are
liability to leave someone off
do you think do you think that
might be possible one of the
things that these advisor groups
might do mister president
produce thank you center would
center stewart.
make you single stewart center
words with the secretaries here
mister president.
Would she have any ideas on that
president center woods my
answers to you are coming
directly from the secretary on
this issue if you'll notice I
let pretty neat.
Am
And the the
the mini concerns that I have
for my employers.
That.
madam protemp says
sixty eighty percent of the
employers they won't affect them
at all.
and we want to protect those
employees.

The employee part.
he'd pay the employee part so
thank you thank you centre with.
I have a think
It may be progress it may be
progress but it's gonna be a
very hard learning curve and
we're going to have a a lot of
employers.
The.
My my guys you know they were
there wives have had some babies
and sometimes I even bring those
kids out on the job we are in
this we just have a family term
out there so.
It's going to be a hard
Thank you mister president.
The.
First whoever is up there you

attacked by big government.
And we've not done anything
wrong.
and i'm just talking to people
here who own businesses.
That blood relation but they're
they're part of the family we
work with each other.
Then there's a couple of things
that were there were were really
concerned about here in one of
those is the unintended
consequences.
it's just a little bit of a text
yeah but a little bit a little
bit a little bit a little bit a
lot eventually and we pay a lot
but I don't think for most of
So
so a question mister president
if if the sponsor the bill will
yield
thank you senator share center
stewart dealed.
wonder to help me out here you
know so I don't use up my voice
all at once
in in all seriousness though
in new mexico where even sure
who the employer is unless we
hired senators of aunt disappear
a lot of money to get out for
but the employees still work
there might be imployed
technically.
By a company in farmington
but they spent a lot of time
working in texas.
But they also do work in new
mexico sometimes.
Do they qualify for this.
employee means person working
within the state who performs a
surface for wages or other
immuneration under contract of
state it does not mean well
that's what it does mean
and I think that's that's one of
those questions mister which
president in exactly so
so
But I didn't work in new mexico
for a hundred and eighty days
this year I worked in new mexico
for seventy days.
it is so my employee is a new
mexican i'm a new mexican I just
didn't work for a hundred and
eighty days in the state this
year because I was in texas or
somewhere else does it cover me.
So mister president it covers
you from day one but if you're
working in other states we
we probably would have to
the minefield issues that were
concerned about.
It's not it's not that I don't
want to take care of somebody
that's part of my my business
family.
take care of yourself but I
don't go through all of the
hoops.
I just do like I would with my
family like all of the business
that into all of this they know
all of a sudden because that
person they were talking about
we're not sure if they if they
worked in new mexico for a
hundred and eighty days or not
most small businesses new mexico
some like ninety percent are too
small to have a an h r section
we don't have an hour
I fear that what's going to
happen is I didn't do the right
thing for the bureaucracy.
The.
To defend myself because I
didn't fill out a form but I
took care of the the actual
human being that needed needed
help.
Even no because we don't have
most of us a professional p h
team.
don't have those we have the big
box stores do.
The big box stores were the
owner is not in in in new
mexico.
or ten or twenty it's a lot
harder to do that.
And that's why the small new
mexico businesses.
Act like a family.
We can take care of people in
help each other.
Without one more
overwhelming bureaucracy.
If you want to beat up the big
box store have at it
let's bring back the small store
i'm good with that.
This is beaten up main street
that's what this does and that's
and that's what our concern.
And for us to be portrayed over
We're not interested more
bureaucracy
smashing our businesses.
They're kind of a specialty
group.
If you have somebody that leaves
carry it care for those kids and
do all that stuff but twelve
weeks.
That's a quarter of the year.
That is a daycare center do that
license or they have to send ten
kids home.
And now you've got ten moms.
Mister president senator I want
to answer the first thing you
talked about before US that
question and that is
while nothing says you can't do
that the whole idea behind the
changes we made today is to ease
that employee employer
situations where people can not
work it's designed to help
employ
get over the hump when some
kidding their full paycheck it's
designed to help employers a pay
for some temporary workers
because they're not paying the
up no there's not a car voucher
for for day care centers day

are
our problematic and some ways

get pregnant
there are usually younger women
and twenty's thirties and
forties and they want to have a
Don't ruin those ratios and come
on back because right now they
just quit they just quit and
then it costs about twenty one
Thank you center stewart center
so mister president I think
that's that's exactly right the
difference is
without this bill.
know that your child's in the
hospital goal take care of your
child and we'll take care of
you.
Go
we'll do that
in so then III meet with you and
I think.
I know that this is going on in
your world is there any way you
can come to work for two days
the week that george is gone
family too and so you want to be
part of the family one help in
so now you saying nope I can't
do tuesday and thursday but
maybe I can do thursday and
friday does that help then now
And in the meantime i'm still
going to pay you.
But that's a negotiation when
this comes in the place there's
no negotiation you tell me
And so you don't have to be part
of the family anymore this this
bill rips the family a park the
May I ask who a health care
provider is mister mister
president and senator thank you
center share center store.
in the ordinary course of
business and let me just say you
can do everything you just
Thank you center stewart center
for sure mister president
someone it's licensed to provide
health care in the normal court
is a nurser health care provider
mister president.
A medical provider healthcare
provider.
I guess in a share.
Finished to it missed president
it would probably would be
Well mr president it could be I
mean if someone is
false and break their jar
whole mouth was wired for three
months.
So mister president can a
denise.
you can't he's got all search
whatever he can't go to work for
twelve weeks can a dentist sign
off on that.
But missed president of course
not.
But it doesn't say that mr
hearts it says a health care
provider which could be the
midwife
could be the dentist
it could be the
minefield things
we don't know who health care
provider is it's going to sign
off on this
then I think that's problem.
So the share was there a
question director there
I was hoping that she would
answer telling me why I denise
shouldn't sign off on it in in
condition is my denise could be
my brother
and we just want to go home
so he signs are finding so okay
well his heart's not going to be
come up with if I can think of
that just off the top of my head
right here right now
some smart guys going to figure
that out.
So.
if the senator will repeat the
questions not all the stuff just
the question
thank you mister president how
reach you part of the bill has
on page seven but that's the
market
serious health condition means
residential medical facility or
continuing treatment by a
healthcare provider in addition
we have all kinds of fraud
issues we have
years the department will verify
employment and wages
the department will require
third party verification of the
qualifying then
violations at the act so
generally paid family medically
frog much more difficult to
commit so nationally they're
just very little fraud uh in
for economic and policy research
report call business as usual
new jersey employers experiences
with family leave insurance no
fraud report.
back to that a minute so mister
president and senator who is the
third party auditor.
Make a center share center store
he's the he's the third party
it's going to verify that I have
a heart condition.
So much present now he's just
being silly.
So silly or not if we honestly
think that something like that
won't happen then we are naive.
Because something like that will
happen.
But they don't say this another
part of this is the safe or
weight words of their.
but in there it says that an
advocate
can be the person so it does
off on that not a doctor not an
attorney not a judge
and advocate and again I think
that there's plenty of room in
Then i'm an advocate cause then
anyone said what any quote of
any qualifications for the
advocate just an advocate my
next door neighbor could be the
advocate
let me first say that a this
last year connecticut heard
about fifty thousand
applications for medical or
family leave and they had
department shall require an
employee or self employed
individuals who six safely
compensation to provide an
accordance with rules a police
the people that protect mostly
women who are victims of
domestic violence and if they're
not protected they are often
sometimes it won't be used very
much but it's important part.
So mister president had she read
just a little bit further a
and unqualified and undefined
not maybe not on qualified and
undefined advocate and so
happens thirteen percent of the
for protection
I absolutely think that we need
to to take care.
Of the people in our business
family.
that our business family.
Gets this big spike driven
through the middle of it.
The now all the same you've
opened the door.
Business family looks after it
that's what new mexico
that's going to take advantage
of this
not all business families are
good in not all advocates are
honest either
and I think part of the depth of
these laws in this bill is that
we absolutely refuse to send it
to a committee that's got a
bunch of attorneys on it to look
certainly don't want to legal
legislate the attorneys in the
room to look at it because wow
if we did that we might have to
amend it
stories over here about new
mexico families the business
family and so mister president
mister president i'm gonna yield
to senator birth
appreciate the opportunity talk
a little bit about this because
when we get into discussions
about bills like this we're
looking at face value where
they're not we're going to pass
And from there it is applied and
we don't think about those
things.
But we need to look at the back
end of this mister president.
and talk about this so I didn't
care about new mexico
and my time in business i'm on
the business for thirty five
years.
experiences with people
personalities policies what you
can can't do should shouldn't do
and I just want to share some of
these experiences with you
about spending a day at a
conference talking about
millennials baby boomers and
genzers.
Because like even small
services.
And so I went to a bank convince
the natural a few years ago when
they talked about genziers they
talked about millennials
millennials will be about sixty
to seventy percent of our
customers
in our employees
and so why is that important
because.
they don't feel that they need
in someone you have.
Customers and our employees who
Conference that I went to these
people spent tons of money
researching all of this and
bringing us to the four front of
country needs to be aware of
these issues so that we can
appeal to these people and be
able to make them our customers
up until about two thousand and
five
gen zeros are of the age group
of that two thousand and five
customers are employees and who
will be using.
This bill if it should pass
will they use this bill well
to most of us on this floor and
people behind us
but a younger generation is very
interesting in doing a good job
interested in and retirement and
i'm not interested in buying a
home.
They are living for today and
they probably live paycheck to
pay check.
The.
it is proven that those folks
will take advantage of
everything that they are
entitled to
so they will be using this and
they will probably be using this
because it will make an impact.
The other thing i'd like to
share mr president and man
You know I think center to share
shared with us the fact that
most employees employers excuse
me
possibly can we give them all
the tools that they need and
then we allow them to do their
jobs and if you get off the
rails we tried getting back.
productivity out of people who
may take advantage of this
particular act
i'm gonna give an example of the
protein knows this we've talked
about in in committee.
she was out of the station for
the better part of six months
and in and out probably for
another two.
Because she was a valued
employee.
covered for her basically
because that's what you do is an
employer of the small coverage
who you have good employees
He never missed a paycheck and
people inside my organization
we're able to cover for him any
both were back working for us
surgery he thought he was going
to be out for five to seven days
well he was out three weeks
never missed paycheck and we
took care of him until he got
back and he's actually back
unlimited terms because he still
I had a lady call me not one but
two days in a row she couldn't
come to work because you had a
headache second day I ask what's
wrong why do you have a headache
or you being exposed to
pulling on her scalp was giving
her a headache.
That is a true story from bert
broadcasting incorporated.
And he he can get better.
So she was gone about ten days
came back and went back to work
and that was fine
year later.
Sorry isn't my mother
these are two story is that you
can't make the stuff up.
for me but these are excuses
that you're going to hear and it
is the mission of people it i'm
trying to pay a picture of
people who will take advantage.
Of this opportunity when we're
telling you they're going to be
people who are really going to
take advantage of it and I
believe from my research that
the more younger people we have
in.
conventions and things of this
nature
so
who covers for these people on
the garden light I told you.
And that made our days much
longer than they normally are.
Because I can't go to a
employment agency and in today's
Process that
requires you to have certain
skills and capabilities that you
must bring inherently to us as
email and expect them to buy
advertising from you you have to
build a relationship with
people.
I know that
mister bridy a cell robertier
We covered for them because we
couldn't just go out and hire a
part time sales person to come
in in and do what we needed to
What kind of relationships we
missed because I couldn't go to
functions because we were
dealing with covering the other
person sales list.
And that's just sales.
probably so you've had the
experience but you know and you
will appreciate what i'm going
say
it is.
with your listening audience and
how do you deal with promotions
when you go out in the public
and what is the best way to draw
more people into you and why is
people why is that important
every county in the united
states and race radio stations
and if there's a t v station
that rate the t v station and if
you are not in the top three
positions especially in a market
so you have to be very good at
what you do that's why we pay
good people and we take care of
good people.
So.
station called traffic this is
when it sells person sells a
client schedule and we're going
to produce.
A commercial for them or
And those schedules will be very
involved in intricate because
different parts of the day
charge different rates and if we
don't put that schedule in
client there so we consistently
have to have quality hi paid
people in these eh positions to
that that takes months of
training that's why you find
good people in you keep good
people because you're going to
spend so much more time in money
and lose money if you don't have
good people on staff.
broadcast association who do
exactly the same thing and I
know people in banking who do
the same thing and they will pay
premium rates to find the right
managers for those different
departments in a bank.
this this law this this bill
I know work for solution is
going to be involved in madame
secretary I hope you're very
very successful you have taken
Which is gonna require them to
hire more people we're going to
build another bureaucracy.
But it seems as though we're
doing all of this when we pass
the bill and they were going to
create the department.
do to make a department or
business run before you actually
buy the business to me that's
practical service that common
sense in yeah we're gonna do
there's infrastructure built
into that but we all know.
Their especially when it comes
to government the way we intend
they didn't get their money they
don't get the right about the
work extra hours
and so there are a lot of things
if you have it worked he charged
before I really
to deal with every day every
month with hr.
There is a specialized field as
well you better know what you're
doing there especially in
today's world with security
I think the last thing that I
could tell you mister president
guarantee it's not it is not
going to be easy to apply
because there's a human element
in this.
It is not that work for solution
you that this is going to be
devastating for small business
i'm gonna repeat that statement
and you can believe me or not
it's going to be devastating for
small business because we don't
have
have to add yet another person
or
pay more people more time to
track all of this because we
have to do it right for work for
solutions.
or we're not going to we're
gonna miss a day or something
like this mistakes are going to
be made
and it's just going to be an
absolute nightmare in somewhere
If you're in the private public
sector if you work for the
government or you work for the
military or you will evor for a
to make as much money as we
possibly can to make sure our
employees are taking care of not
only by their payroll but their
protest great great great
concerns about the application
of this bill I think you're
really trying to do something
good but I think we're doing it
government is involved in
setting up an operation like
this
we're gonna be in trouble and
secondly
I guess I would ask the question
why is government doing this in
the first place.
from being in business for
thirty five years
so i'm willing to help.
But i'm just telling you this is
signs of and we don't see it
again i'm talking about the back
in where we as employers are
going to see an absolute
nightmare of keeping up with
The employee to get their money.
And of course we have had
several discussions about DFA
another bureaucracy on top of
all that that they're going to
have to
be able to provide pay for
thousands of people every month
businesses and in mexico
employees before we ever pass
this bill thank you mister
president I like to differ back
to senator share thank you
senator
what really happens in real life
not what happens in the
committee room or in a backroom
where a couple people are trying
to figure out how to have a get
a bill that will get enough
votes.
here is that this bill takes us
out.
Once we do this we're out.
They now of a burok received the
So mister president earlier I
talked about a uh health care
provider a medical provider in
question whether the medical
provider would be on the on the
doctor in soul I would like to
yield to senator doctors
meetings for his input on on
this
thank you senator share senior
smith deal.
been speaking about this I mean
it's just
really really hits the now on
the head I i'm just so honored
to serve with with all of you
it's that relationship peace
between the employer and the
employee and it's the employers
that are doing a good job now
the ones are doing a good job
convince anyone to my left
to vote against this bill or
that it's not
ninety good and the reason is
because number one you believe
they're a a kind of a favored
group
and I I think you'll your
sometimes
can can can just be a little too
and and your policies
the other problem
is that
believe people are inherently
good.
And I I don't believe that
and so beat because the you you
generally believe they believe
abuse this and you can sometimes
gloss over that and I think
having this conversation I am on
the opposite side of that I will
generally look
absolutely this bill is going to
help some people in some
situations absolutely but I
don't want to gloss over the
fact
of a kind of employer employee
bill or policy that I think
represents something good and
was a very good compromise and I
and I believe was
I don't know a few years ago
what a great bill really great
by partisan bill supported
relationships between employers
And I was so happy to to vote in
favor of that bill
but I don't think that this bill
is is shaped in that way.
And it was very interesting
pattern it seems that his
employees after that only got
sick on mondays or fridays
president what are the chances
that people just get sick in
those certain days i'm i'm not
aware that there is a a none
contract illnesses the day after
the superbowl of the day after
history he showed me the chart
so that's
It's actually worse for the
employee.
In the import we tend to think
about the other way around like
oh the employer they're they're
enabling that simpleness that I
think is in all of us to turn to
be lazy or not work hard enough
to steal whatever it is whatever
you're taking a day off to work
when you're not really sick the
day after super bowl that don't
tell me that's a coincidence
it's not if you just decide to
do that you are stealing from
that's the ultimate loser is is
the character of new mexico in
bringing and making policies
that are exploiting that
a couple of other things i'd
like to say.
Number one just this is just a
point maybe for as this bill
goes over to the house
company to give us data and we
can say okay this survey
supports my policy but in in
committee
this has been said hey eighty
detailed I gave details about
you know point five percent and
point four percent all these
other things but it didn't say
anything about safe leave miss
president it talked about the
evidence in our studies and if
we claim eighty five percent of
the support this it's really not
supporting what's in the bill
necessarily it's it's you know
they are really understanding
the safe leave part of this bill
so I did want to point that out
mister president uhm
this is this is the biggest
problem that I have with this
about employers that are already
doing a good job.
And how they're going to be her
by this bill how that
relationship is going to be hurt
and in that is really what
common pattern i'd like to make
analogies to other
areas of politics that bother me
about the common thread of
we bring people that are
succeeding and doing well
we bring them down
and the reason is because you
know I I value merit
sameness and I like that word
generally the left use the word
equity but it's a it's a forced
so you can't succeeds who can't
you know rise above and recruit
the better workers and entry
your workers well and keep them
our our kind of cookie cutter
benefit thing across the board
if you're doing a great job as
an employer then you don't earn
have the best employees you're
things medical practices are
calling me you're talking to me
because they they normal
physician and they're like this
is going to be crushing to our
practice we want to be here we
want to take care of new
this where there's a government
program established you're
already you're already have
mandating this over them and
then then it's like what are
what are we going to do now and
and it just doesn't let people
succeed it doesn't like people
compete
and I I just I just think it's
so damaging to our society
programs because it's you know
people are are having too much
success and it's not fair to the
lower sup- you know performing
students I mean that's what's
frustrating to me same thing
with the cliff effect you know
are our welfare program we we
subsidise poverty that's what we
You know it is is that once
again that same mindset that
keeps people down.
Mister president energy policy
you know let's not get people
You know I could kind of go on
and I
progressive
or I am sorry rip regressive
that comes out here and this is
just it's just the same sort of
thing
and so mister mister president I
think the one the one reason
and that's that's what i'm
hearing from the business
community.
And it's a mister president
especially when I hear from from
health care groups that that
they have major concerns it's
care work for us even more and
hit a swallow down
and so III hope I have made my
point clear
I I have I have a lot of other
view a world view issue here and
so i'm not going to change
anybody's world do you I I don't
think tonight with my debate
and that's not the purpose of my
to be
damaging for that employee
employer relationship when it's
doing well and allow in on a
positive you know once again I
do want to reiterate that I have
no doubt that there will be some
center share thank you mister
president so we've heard some
very compelling stories here
from farmers from radio stations
mister president I yield to
senator garages.
Thank you senator share center

the business community is very
scared to this I had one
gentleman that doesn't trust
government mandated change it is
to when we had covered we had
businesses all across the state
the closer doors we had
restaurants with some long
fault of this chamber.
But today when this chamber
we leave the session we go home
and we take no blame with us.
I didn't want to talk about
incredible family that I was

We're talking and at that time
though it's a fifth generation

it will affect them
tomorrow I know there's a delay
on this and we have to

really think through
who are decisions help or hurt.

I appreciate this option in just
to the businesses that believe
they can handle their job
without government mandate and
construction company that has
similar similar story similar
problems similar fears about
what's going to happen out there
if we change another piece of
Then it responses that I was
going to talk to him but no it's
senator neighbor.
Make you send a share for moment
there that you are going to
yield to me.
before get to the legal part of
it to have i'd like to talk
about a couple things and number
one we were handed piece of
communications from the new
mexico business coalition and
others that reflect quite the
their membership or no ninety
four percent of its membership
animately opposed three percent
mostly opposed so that's ninety
businesses but certainly it's an
important aspect and I I kind of
wonder uh where they came up
with without figure
Senator gagas uh pointed out
we've had employees that have
found themselves in.
Unusual
And I can tell you in every
instance
there is an effort made.
By our law firm to try to
going to be less willingness on
the part of employers to do
exactly what you said in the
first instance matters work with
the employees and try to
process and so i'm concerned
about the impact that that will
have on our businesses not only
the three that you mention that
the impact it's going to have on
uh.
Frankly my voice counts.
this applies to the part time
positions or summer time
positions I know we have the six
month uh provision in there now
face the challenges that may be
imposed in this and also
a view sense or a few dollars
out of every paycheck to
those that are trying to turn a
little bit of money while
they're in school and trying to
uh gain some experience and
whether or not uh
correctly uh senator share is
that it applies to both part
time and full time the employees
I don't see any exception there
so
i'm also wondering from a legal
stamp point
there is an appeal process but
uh the appeal process is multi
to speak what is the ultimate
recourse for the employer
I don't see that spelled out
you know get the some other
forum of uh uh punishment that
regard and then finally
From one employer to the next
employer to the next employer if
there's a track record of of
mister president and
senator share
those are the concerns I have
with the bill now you'll back my
time.
sponsor would yield to try to
answer some of senator
neighborhoods questions if I ask
them to hear directly.
Senator stewart yield why not
it says a hundred and eighty
days but is that a hundred and
eighty one hour days.
Senator stewart.
The.
year it's based on your wage so
you make lot fewer wages part
time so you would pay less in
and you would also get less in
center stewart so mister
president so
so the bureaucracy gets to to
pay that but the business still
has to hire more hour people
Mel seasons are something if if
if if they're somebody that's
done this wrong what is what are
the consequences.
The.

related to fragile obtaining
fraud so although we said that
there is very little fraud in
any of the states for a family
medical leave acts we take it
years that employee could also
be charged on any of those other
categories that I just mentioned
on page seventeen department
then that's where all those
medical professional
professionals are involved.
Section page twenty two employer
has the right to appeal the
to seventeen department can
bring its own action to pursue
violations of the act and this
would include going after for a
chile climates.
people in new mexico have
actually been charged with with
fraud against an employer
thank you center shares in the
very few um just the the process
of going through that to have
the d a or the attorney general
or whoever to pursue this that's
a very low
there's a reason why there's no
fried like that reported because
it has a high peter factor for
the for the district attorney
and if you'll remember peter
factors pain in the rear factor
I would now like to work to get
the female perspective on what
happens here
to businesses and what's going
mister president center bandy
thank you senator share mr
president I too have some
concerns with a spell first of I
created in new mexico and
continue to create do we want to
live in a state of of poverty do
we want to live in a state where
in a bill like this that is open
wide open for so much fraud and
abuse you can almost not blame
those that take advantage of
Who I and cheat and steel and we
create a government that lets
them do a way do do do it they
become so dependant on us that
they can't get out of a broken
bill it's wide open work for
solutions right now has a
vacancy of six percent already
they are overrun with
unemployment insurance claims so
the local santander company and
truth or consequences.
A drunk seaman truck driver
carrying a scene metruc racks
scene of the crime within days
they received an unemployment
claim
and by the time they could
actually return that to the
mailbox the claim had been
granted and he continued to
to pay any of that back but
because it created a major
accident and was a problem on
the road and it's not just work
for solutions they're in indated
There's a transparency issue or
should I say lack of
transparency as well
detailed information isn't it
who is taking advantage of this
I want names and the amount of
money and I say it's no
different than posting pp money
use public funds it should be
public record and yet that
transparency in the friday abuse
will continue to fester because
we're going to cover that
especially in roll districts.
This fire here says that a
number of small businesses were
consulted and the creation of
couldn't even find any from the
corolla catcher and county ruled
in mexico seems to be completely
left out of this conversation
and we've had many conversations
I will tell you a story about a
friend of mine who has a as the
great six success story there
and truth are consequential she
comes in from when standards
worker and she is a smart woman
and of course she begins to
flourish this big this business
as insurance businesses continue
to grow and grow she hired
our largest supporters as we
know small businesses big donors
at the county fair they support
every sports team it's always
the same businesses and in small
towns and she is right in there
she wants to because this this
exact program will now impact if
she does or is she better off
not doing it and every dollar
she's got a number of women in
the office depending on her and
one right on the edge who
depending on if this goes
through she's not sure she could
Sherren paid them while they
were gone could bring your
babies into the office if you
were sick she creates this work
respect because we're going to
have to mandate the states going
to tell her instead how they
will receive leave and when they
will receive leave instead of
she is one of the losers in this
bill there's a lot of losers in
his bill agencies and industries
that are already experiencing
subject to paid family medical
leave means the dws like all
agencies will need to staff in
staff up in it in preparation
anticipating coverage shortages
they're right there's a problem
coming
invested in those employees so
through this program with one of
her agents were to leave
she would bring on her temporary
or her replacement and by the
off and there's already a
financial investment that would
have to be made and the
temporary employee so by the
time the twelve weeks is of
schools hospitals any industry
that has skilled the laborers
will lose.
But perhaps the most
of the largest labor forces and
rolling mexico as you know I
represent the us mexico border
of her dog on luna into dodiana
county and a large number of our
work force our migrant labors
and they're not it's an unfair
tax being placed on a large work
force population in my district
who will never see a return on
the most vulnerable population
who will be discriminated
against is a population that has
worked for generations to
pro woman bill women of child
bearing age like myself
if it comes to hiring decision
between a man
and either a child bearing women
because inherently I am a care
give her and my family
inherently if there's a child I
am more than likely to one.
Are there than the father to
To take off and need to take off
and that that invisible
discrimination will take place I
promise you that the unintended
consequence of a bill that means
assumed that someone has a
health condition in comparison
to a man who doesn't I promise
you will be considered never
taking new mexico backwards.
Think there's a discrimination
issue too that we've given
business owners know it rule new
mexico so it's completely left
out of the process.
And the unintended victims.
president so again will the
sponsor of the bill yield for
for a question center share
center still deal yield yes
so
mister president senator
not federal employees count in
decent include lab employees who
are also federal employees.
The.
Thanks in her share center
cyfd can't take
a responsibility or care of a
child if the if the parents are
federal employees even though
they live here.
Senator
mister president I I almost sort
of get that but it does seem a
little strange to me because
to abide by well every law
except this one
this doesn't quite seem right so
so if that's the answer I I am
Mister president it's the
employer that we don't have
state jurisdiction over.
two yield to senator nevil
because I don't think you've
heard enough from the northwest
corner of the state yet so so
let's hear from somebody that
me to the microphone and I
didn't get on the on the list so
if you don't mind indulging me
for a minute senator that
sponsor if you deal to have just
a few things I wanted to clear.
first off if a person is on
leave through this program who
pays for the benefits that would
normally come out of the wages
paid and i'm talking about
things how does that get handled
if a person takes off their
twelve weeks make you send
available centers so mister
president that's why we yield it
they're not earning certain
things and so how does it how do
those things pay role taxes and
so security taxes and all of
that come how was all that
handled make a center share
provided that if if the
employer's on insurance the
employee has to pay their part
when they're on leave and the
employer has to pay their part.
Thank you center center share
president if the sponsor could
could answer that mister
president they are not earning
wages so they don't earn social
security.
Senator bill thank you mister
president a senator share maybe
if you could tell me
that's the case but the wording
from the sponsor earlier was
that the employee was
responsible and I wanted to
clarify to make sure who
actually had managed that
administrative duty.
the bill answer that question
makes sense here similar store.
Am I being asked to yield a yes
for the answer to answer a
So sure mister president I will
I will yield to senator never to
ask me the question out loud so
that the sponsor of the build
doesn't have to interpret my
didn't quite catch all of it
sooner to share
I was asking
does the employee have to admit
do the administration of their
own point o five percent from
Senator so mister president I
believe that senator nevil has
to senator novel to ask his
questions about thank you mister
president I wanted to clarify as
I read the bill
weeks is about twelve thousand
dollars or so give her take
at point oh nine percent
formula thank you very much
mister president would be
sponsored the bill yield to that
question center store dealed.
makes minimum wage that employee
is paid their entire wage anyone
who makes over minimum wage they
state main wage and the cap on a
leave wage leave payment is a
president and I believe her the
smart senator from san want
county still has more questions
to a yield senator novel again
available mister president
were I I can't answer that yeah
I believe it is but years.
Any center share okay senator
shares mister president center
if you would normally get twelve
thousand dollars and you take
the forty eight let's say five
thousand for round numbers five
thousand off of the twelve that
gives you seven left that you
mrperiod president I think I
think it's more than that but I
will I will ask but it's if you
get minimum wage you get minimum
wage.
It's if you get above minimum
twelve week period
if you do the minimum wage it's
a bit little over it's around
five thousand dollars for round
numbers so that leaves seven
thousand dollars that that
to share mister president if the
sponsor would give us a an
answer if she would yield to
give us an answer on that thank
you center store.
replacement is sixty seven
percent over the minimum wage so
they're weekly replacement would
be eight hundred and fifty nine
dollars the minimum wage is
replacement at a hundred percent
of minimum wage.
thank you mister president I
think i'm pretty well out of
questions except for one thing
the employer loses income from
the lack of having this employee
on
Thank you center will center
share mister president again a
brilliant question if the
sponsor would yield finance
centers to it mister president
workers they can give higher
wages to the workers that are
taking their load so that is the
benefit for the employer.
president once again I yield
center number the only thing I
would I would concur with the
bill sponsor to some degree
that's an are benefit but if
that fifty thousand dollars
mister president and senator
share I appreciate the
discussion and i'll yield the
floor back to senator share
thank you senator ville center
share thank you mister president
and uh that senator gricks thank
you center share senator greek
deal I do mispresident.
Thank you center greg's nice job
senator kitchen.
absolutely have a business for
awhile that we were we're able
to grow and then ultimately
shell for a for a profit which
was a which was a good thing but
bill was the fact that we had we
had a bill that had
had thirty two thirty three
pages in that bill had thirty
talking about the fact that that
bill had never had never seen
the judiciary committee and I
think it's it's part it's
important to point out then when
we talk on page twenty five we
talk about things as soon as
practicable and or again on
twenty five we talk about
reasonable effort and nowhere
on work for solutions to
in room making to identify what
those things mean but I believe
president those things certainly
through the bill i'm just just
trying to put some numbers
together and some ideas about
what things are
a chose to use a fifteen dollars
an hour employee.
will pay about a hundred and
fifty six dollars a year and
employer pay about a hundred and
twenty four dollars a year so
they'll pay that two hundred and
pay for fifty two weeks I don't
know in the bill whether or not
they're going to pay for a full
fifty two weeks or they'll get
is a whole show but usually
going back in using those
numbers I think you come up with
a little over fifty five hundred
dollars a year that get paid
into the fund based on a fifteen
But then I did some other.
Extrapolations on some staff and
we have in the FIR we talk about
this program and if you use a
seventy five thousand dollars a
year
cautious per employee that's
sixteen million two hundred
just the portion of it that
handles this particular fish
particular program
sure it's going to take your
center share
and a hole I don't see sinner
munios in other years
but it looks to me like he's
going to have to come up with
to pay for itself and I think
you do have a a portion of the
the bill on page twelve were
allowed to secretary to increase
also when we're we're looking at
dish
you know I was I just mayor of
alama gordo and I I believe that
is also meaning paladision
for solution when they talk
about they need two hundred and
sixteen new employees that mean
they really need two hundred and
sixteen or they're going to need
a whole lot more because so many
concern me when we when we're
looking at the the issues it
come about in this bill
especially in especially in
community like alamo gordow
title insurge company who might
be a a loan all for sure at a
bank who might be concrete
finishers who might be a plumber
might be electricians might be a
nation sharely find those those
shoves to two people
just out there readily to
to assume that the job did
intentioned and I believe
they're that's true I believe it
is but I believe it's fright
with problems senator bert
Before we make it try to work uh
and I believe that's a better
way to go about it as well
because I know I know if you
were to go tomorrow down to your
government trying to put this
thing together so with that I
will I will leave back to you
shutter thank you center grade
sender to share thank you mister
president
Center period and and thank you
mister president thank you
senator i'm gonna keep it brief
I know I know we've been here
quite a while and
senator munios or senator share
sending reburn
myself senator mccatch in and I
know that in the private sector
we we take care of our employees
we do they're their extensions
of the children of of employees
of mine to where it does become
family and I can tell you
probably more than a dozen
burial or anything along those
lines where the one thing they
didn't have to worry about was
where the money was going to
come from for the for the
paycheck that they were missing.
the bit the worst employer in
the state of new mexico is the
state of new mexico.
And that's the issue that's the
root that's why
employer when it comes to taking
another
serial number at the end of the
day that a check gets cut to
your not a member of the family
and when you don't show up to
Public sector employees are the
worst treated
in the private sector their
family.
So that needs to just hit home
and understand that we're in a
punish or basically vilify.
do as you take away my ability
to attract imployees
by bringing up the worst of the
worst the bad actors that really
senator share wants to go
but when you go home just
realize that's the issue here.
The issue is the state of new
mexico is probably the worst
Aps is the worst school district
in new mexico
yeah I said it we all know it.
It's time to shoot straight we
so then we put rules and things
in place that affect rals will
they affect tade on the effect
roy cliff school district
because APS can't handle their
business.
mistreat their employees and
what's the first thing we want
to do just at another level of
bureaucracy
is the five cents going to put
my farmer dairy out of business
little bit because my family
takes pride in ensuring that
that are employees don't have to
worry about these things when
they come up
and you're essentially gonna
that you get left over at the
target into the into the red
bucket with the person dressed
as santa clause jingling the
bell.
They feel scared it was
pretty good about yourself and
then all the set and all those
deductions come down and then
what you're left with it doesn't
feel like charity anymore it
feels like somebody stole
something from you.
charitable and be a good family
member with its employees.
The other thing that i've.
The other thing that I have
mister president is you know
Went through are the process the
entire hiring process shows up
to work day one and happens to
be
pregnant.
Because you can't fire somebody
for that but the position can
magically disappear
so if that's the world you want
I know she's only six but some
days she's gonna
get a job in if she wants to
work on the farm then more power
to her.
a farmer but if she doesn't.
There's going to be bad players
and it's not going to be the
businesses of the people within
this building or small
That's regretion mister
president that's going
backwards.
And if you want a regress will
continue to put policies like
this in place but that's what's
businesses like mine or
businesses like senator shares
it's going to come from the bad
actors that are already not
taking care of their employees.
And so I think they need to hit
home with a few people tonight
that these are the unintended
consequences of this type of
legislation that I think we
really should think through.
Feel that the sponsor is coming
from a good place and I really
appreciate that I really do.
I really do.
And and I think we all agree
can go home knowing that we
maintain decoral maintained
respect and no matter how the
vote comes out we're just gonna
agree to disagree.
With that or you'll back to
nobody used that term on me.
But appreciate so mister
president I now want to yield to
the the man of all times and the
forward to going for a month
senator share to senator
mccatchen senator mccutching are
you ready
mister president yesterday are
you ready
There is an institution in carls
at its famous there and and
throughout the state it was
created in nineteen seventy
that was born with down syndrome
and they need a lot of they need
a lot of help in in raising him
and trying to get him in the
education that you needed so
they started cark in nineteen
members this sometimes it was
just enough for her to go to the
grocery store and take a few
moments to herself and but
without that kind of support she
didn't know what she would have
they have about a hundred and
seventy employees.
And they have about seventy or
seventy five full time residents
and take another five to eight.
but they have federally mandated
staffing levels that they have
to that they have to maintain
and without this federally
mandated staffing levels than
week to try to make sure the
staffy levels or met they staff
twenty four hours a day.
Now this is not only.
Something that's positive for
the.
it but they also have jobs and
they also earn money and because
there are medicaid fund its
facility they can only earn so
much money and only keep so much
money
so with that.
They actually earn money and
it's earned at a deficit
because the way they figure
their taxes they do so.
special needs employees earn the
more they have to pay out.
Now I I haven't seen any
exemptions and I I guess we
could ask the sponsor to
special needs and maybe that's a
question that we should ask i'm
not really sure the process of
asking that right now
but is there any exemption for
you were she can go ahead and
ask the sponsor the piece of
legislation to yield so so
mostly that is senator I don't
think I can yield I don't think
he can yield after he's been
yes mister pres okay well then
center my my cution and essence
what we're going to do is we're
gonna go ahead and go back then
to send it your share senator
share so thank you mister
interest senator mccurtchan's
question.
Well mister president he didn't
ask me one so you can ask me a
question if you like and i'll
that synergy cution was
describing who can only earn so
much money who certainly have
other disabilities in their life
are there any exceptions for
no carphones but you know if
that is a state funded program
we certainly need ourselves to
increase reimbursement to that.
Center stewart for the answer to
the question there the problem
is and in claiming that these
special needs people would
take advantage of the paid
family medical leave because
they are
part of the institution their
they're able to they're able to
understand more about money
they're able to buy a few things
that they that they that they
need and they consider this or
how now they that they they
going to be paying into a system
as well that they get that they
can not benefit out of in the
purpose and in in bringing this
up is just to say we are going
to put an awful strain.
mothers of children they have
special needs we put an undo
strain on them and
actually risk some of those
responses as well there that is
not a state program that is a
federally mandated program and
sponsored through medicaid and
Of the paid family medical leave
act will be the special needs
community throughout the state
and with that a yeal thank you
thank you very much and in my
particularly to go and keep the
decorum if they would be that
opportunity to yield but I know
exactly what you're doing is
we're going forward to your holy
decoram it's very admirable but
at the same time
we continue to go ahead and
bell trust and so that was the
purpose of me asking if they
would be their yield but i'm
going back to you senator share
here and currently she works for
me.
I would hate to do anything
That senator mccurchan's story
is very close to home from me
and very close to my heart and I
do believe that this does not
thank you very much center share
we're going to as senator baca
send your bucket please they
give mister president I won't be
yielding to anybody who accept
back to sender share so let's be
Because that's what happened to
recovered.

and now create another working
group.
president I think they were even
considering this just based on
that fact is ludicrous why would
we do that
maybe we should gather back or
find that missing two hundred
five years that this bill has
been passed through there and I
I guess you know as we continue
to move it again I don't know if
it's going to go through this
year mister president maybe it
will maybe won't you know maybe
And then if it's short again
with that because this body
repeatedly.
Has rejected this measure.
prides and ego's sake we are
going to get this measure and
shove it forward again the
business community the employee.
this measure over and over and
over again
i'm a let everybody on a little
secret mister president
new mexico doesn't want this.
room don't understand that and
so they keep bringing it back
again and again exercising
authority over each other and
this legislature mister
president.
The intended use to this
legislature is to bring fourth
measures and to new negotiating

the middle of the night passing
these things to enslave you

We're not talking about a lot of
people here twenty twenty

do they have to pay for the time

That is blind.
That has no experience in
business.
upon the public a message of
sympathy there is full of false
hope.
steadfastness of small business
to be able to employ people.
This country is not based on
taking care of us just like
private business has been doing
for decades in this statements

issues that they have.
San magel county another small
county you might be familiar
with mister president twenty
eight thousand dollars.
county would prefer to do and
for the small county's thirteen
thousand dollars is a lot but
even for burner leo seven
hundred thousand dollars is a
lot and so with that mister
president.
yielding to center on yours
center on yours please thank you
mister president in you know I I
kind of believe in the concept
businesses and employees watch
their paychecks every single
time you write a paycheck if
you're short by five dollars
they will let you know
you'll add another deduction in
the line in the same way to this
come from and what's it for and
you'll explain to me you're
eligible for for paid leave if
do y it may be for bread it may
be for alcohol but they will
look deeply at those checks and
they're spending and they'll see
what can I cut in my household
Either insurance or any other
area if you have a sep like we
do for employees that we match
fifteen percent of their
line is that they make for the
hours they put in an and do that
and if you take their overtime
on top of the small propire and
we run a lot over time because
If you remember a couple of
years ago in the martinis

but people inhabit will kill
more things and hurt more people

they're going to look at all the
research behind before they
start higher and employees are
going to see everything before
they even call them in for a
background check.

normally understand the

time and didn't pay them they

very becoming I can pay my
mother passed away this year and
I was at her house four or five
And if I had had that to take
the time off to do that well
that would have been my choice
to do that because we didn't

business here's my family which

But we should do that we should
figure out a way to make this a
so for those of you that
schedule pooler than come into
my last three hours of closing.
But there are some things that I
think are very important here
police officer that actually
lives on campus and some high
schools and more and more
talking about that so in this
case they get paid but they also
get a house because they're
vehicle so they get fuel to get
a car to get a house.
And I don't think anywhere in
here we talk about how that wage
is calculated in here it's not
cash.
handle this and this is a big
deal.
And in new york they actually
have a private uh insurance
program that does this people
have and how much to expect to
go out all those kind of things
new york a pretty progressive
state are the private company to
run it as opposed to state
going to do it ourselves.
When we talk about doing it
ourselves
with this bill does is cut us
out no longer does the house
where the senate have any
control of this.
And were the appropriating body
and we've done that a lot
and I notice that there's not
much the
legislative finance committee
can do because some of its so
much of it has already been
turned over to the executive.
strangest things that I see here
is that
when when we do this in the
government uh increases when the
government is responsible for
What's the private business
going to do the privace business
just has to eat it.
But all of the government

And so the taxpayer is going to

the employers going to pay for
No
was it yesterday or day before
now things have started to run
together here we talked about
financial literacy.
But rarely do we take an active
effort in training our brain.
Events that happen around us
train our brain.
And if we're talking financial
literacy you gotta get it's not
the math.
You have to train your brain
first and that's what we have to
The small new because businesses
are the businesses that are
gonna suffer from this not the
big box stores.
the people that support this or
the organizations.
They're all advocacy groups.
The people that pose this or all
And here's what I think is going
to happen because we've already
seen it.
because of their age or sex or
whatever about them aren't going
to be hired and I think that's
true no you can't say it out
loud of course.
I don't have to worry about this
cause the computer is not going
to get sick and if it does get
sick I thought by a new
computer.
And I think that's a bad plan
all the way around.
We need to find economic base
businesses.
any other economic
businesses coming in here but I
want more economic businesses
coming here and if we are going
Mister president we all know
where this is going.
It's going right down the
throats of the businesses the
new mexico own businesses.
the pitfalls that are here.
It's not that we don't love our
business families we do love our
business families.
But the small new mexico
businesses do in that who's
going to take this hit.
The small new mexico business
and the new mexicans that work
there.

Thank you mister president but I
usually don't talk more but it's
been a little lonely standing
so first of all last year was
the first time we ever had a
paid family medical leave bill
in the senate and we passed it.
businesses in the state and we
got the small business majority
whose executive director lives
in rear rancho uh they started
sixty small businesses ninety
nine employees orth smaller
eighty five percent of them.
Supported creating that's paid
has state administered paid
family medical leave would allow
them to compete with the larger
why paid family medically will
help small businesses and i'm
going to go through these.
So one very important one that I
discrimination it's probably
already here
those states that have a paid
family medically program have a
much larger percentage of women
said that if we had paid family
medical leave we would have
forty seven thousand more
workers and one point four
billion more and wages women go
public schools we have vacancies
we need to start having
friendlier policies so that we
keep people in the work force
participation and insuring
families have financial
resources during periods of
disruption means more money
flows into the local economy
businesses in new mexico have
fewer than five employees those
employers don't pay once in time
their employees pay so that they
people who take paid family
medical leave are more likely to
be employed by the same employer
two years later I talked about
my constituent whose daughter

in reports and statistics and
than fifty percent increase in
measures of productivity there's
also reduced labor cost one
study finds up fourteen decrease
our businesses help their
employees I mean i'm proud of
that i'm proud that some
businesses try to make this
happen on their own they tend to
injuries and deaths when workers
were serious health conditions
take paid leave there more
likely to be fully recovered and
ready for work
and of course you've heard it
helps simple compete with big
businesses you heard about my
constituent who looked for a
state with paid family medical
leave
With low unemployment how
turnover new mexico small
businesses are struggling to
find workers while fewer than
half of new mexican women are
much more quickly and
comprehensively certainly then
we did at the start of the
pandemic took the burden off
small business owners who are
often trying to figure out how
to support their employees.
Having this kind of an insurance
program takes the burden off all
business owners
companies adopted paid leave
policies I am not making this up
this is from the small business
majority and from the
documentation of the other
worker earnings across to all
workers not just those who took
the leave then did businesses
when no workers took the leap
there's more financial stability
more the benefit is spell
available for business owners
too they can option or opt out
sometimes they need to get away
track with this I hope we can
join the fourteen other states
that are far ahead of us you
know the united states it's the
five other countries tongue over
that is uh a few others that you
you can barely hear her here of

answer a lot of the issues that
are economically disadvantaging
the mexico now we don't all
agree.
my backhauds from standing for
five hours but i'll get over it
but i'm telling you it's time
for us to join the modern world
children when they're born it's
important unicef suggests that
we give new mother's six months

loans so we could bond with that
baby.
So
changes hard
six months for the work for a
solution to do education we want
to work with businesses and we
