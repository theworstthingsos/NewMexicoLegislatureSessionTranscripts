Here.
Thank you chair and and members
of the committee i'm here to
present house bill eight it is
very similar to a bill that you
passed a last session in house
bill five
of some with improvements and so
I see house will eight amends
the government contact contact
act it provides a new section
defining its intent and provide
specific guidance to public
officers and employees about
prohibited acts including
engaging in political activities
while on duty in a government
office while wearing a uniform
or official insignia or while
using a government vehicle
except when state law
enforcement officers are
provided security in an elected
state office so the the governor
would be exempt from that and
the ages office as well
additionally a clarifies
provisions prohibiting abuse of
office would prodashquote
corruption acquisition of
financial interests resulting
for a minute official act and
misuse a public property the
also makes private employer of a
former officer or employee
liable for a prohibited asked of
that employee if the employer
knowingly caused the violation
to occur including liability of
any civil liberties or other
remedies under the acts and then
finally hb eight subsequently
increases the civil penalty used
for the violation the act from a
flat two hundred and fifty
dollars per violation to now
it's up to a ten thousand
dollars per violation it can be
a dollar to ten thousand dollars
and i'd like to get this moment
to introduce my expert witness.
Good morning madame.
Representative I introduced this
bill very well I just want to
see that the the cover.
What this bill is it reflects
the wor.
For years.
And what this bill is just
really reflects what.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Additionally
activities are also changes
with understand.
Yeah.
The league.
The.
Thank you madame chair.
The.
In the guitar.
A man of chair representatives I
i'm not sure what you're
referring to I will see that
this bill is house built eight
we did house bill five in it
passed the house.
So i'm not really sure what the
questions but I might not have
heard it completely cause
of medium chairs and represent.
Is if you charge wars to me but
the correct charge was in their
sort of.
Specific charges.
And maybe we.
That is my memory.
I think you think you
representative and thinking
madam chair all of different in
my expert witness.
Yeah.
Part of what this built.
Thank you madame chair and
expert when a when I look at
this act it was initially dr.
If we go to page two and one in
three we see that we.
I don't know what thousand
dollars
but if it was put in in sixty
seven.
Thank you so much madam sharing
think you represented a frame
you are correct it also required
a minimum penalty of two hundred
and fifty dollars up to and so
the current bill in front of you
says that the penalty is up to
ten thousand dollars but there
is no mini.
And medicare representative
have you thought about raising
this part of a thousand dollars
up
to the days you know what it
would be equal today so thank
you madam chair thank you
representatives of yes we've
raised it to ten thousand
dollars
up to ten thousand dollars.
That's what the bill states but
there is no minimal so used to
have a minimum of two fifty up
to a thousand dollars now it
just says up to ten thousand
dollars
manager and represent categories
and page two warning too
contract means in agreement or
transactions have been a value
of more than one thousand
dollars with a state or local
government.
This is what i'm talking about
that is behind.
From the inflation.
Madam chair representative i'll
i'll defer to my expert witness
on the
dollar mount um I will just
state that.
The.
I can't flict it interested any
dollar amount is something we
want to avoid.
Representative.
Mm.
Medicare and representative i'm
not opposing the bill okay.
You know the real problem is how
do you mandate.
Or require it.
I mean either the person has it
or they don't you know and and
you know what the sheriff's.
When I left it was like this and
you could go to sections and
almost go well this is deputy so
and so.
I mean I think that's why you
see.
Let me go to another section of
your and when we go to page five
and we go to wine thirteen
we say any other elected.
The.
Thank you madame chair and
representative yet this statute
is for state employees and
elected officials.
The the local such as your
sheriff's department would have
their own standard of ethics.
So
madam chair and representative
when we go to page six and we
start looking in.
From what I eat on down and what
i.
Employee t.
The think you madam chair and
representative I this is not a a
criminal accident
representative
the penalties reflect that there
are no minimal vile penalties
they're up to ten thousand
dollars so if there is an ethics
violation that the commission
deems deserves a penalty of five
dollars they have the ability to
do that.
You look at that so you know we
have.
Man of chair.
That's.
Thank you madame chairman thank
you representative thank you
mister being here and all the
good folks in the audience
pursuits you all.
So.
Mr madam chair and uh
representative first of all I
just wanted to go through what I
start here on page.
Three
so the language on lines eighth
or ten politic.
So it's as directed toward the
successor failure of a political
party.
Candidate or partisan
partisan political office or.
A political group that's
partisan so uh madam chair
representative would this not
apply to a was to see a c four
organization that is a nonprofit
they're technically not partisan
but they do endorse candidates
for office madam.
Thank you madame chair I think
you representative I will defer
to my expert witness but I will
see that this is for imstate
employee and elected official
zam but I will differ to my
expert witness to speak
specifically honest li.
The.
This definition.
State employees from us.
Thank you madame chairman thank
you for that representative and
mister so I appreciate the
clarification it's already
covered in the s.
So i'm then just wondering why
do we need this additional
adden if there's already
a provision covering misuse of
these funds madam chair
thank you matt madame share and
represent allow my expert
witness.
Representative block the the
definition of political activity
and the.
Thank you madam chair and think
you representative and mrperiod
farres so with this then with
this applied to.
A cabinet secretary.
A madam.
Thank you madame thank you
representative because I know
there there are a lot of
political issues that we deal
with as legislators and we have
cabinet secretaries we have the
department of justice here who
is a state why it elected office
and these folks
they they advocate for bills and
that's you could think of that
as political to further a
political party's goals.
That would that be covered in
this legislation would we have
some kind of stop gap for folks
to be able to come to the
legislature and give testimony
that may be partisan and be
covered.
Madame chair representative i'll
let my expert witness address
that but I will see that bills
A judged individually as part
of.
There trying to weak a certain
madame
i'll just go to my expert with
that.
Yeah.
Thank you madame chair thank you
representative I
I appreciate that answer mister
so just to clarify if I was a
cabinet secretary it wouldn't be
under this administration i'm
sure but if I was a cabinet
secretary and I said I like this
party vote for this guy this
would then cover me and
currently in the life if they
did that now there would be no
provision specifically in the
law to hold me account that
correct manager.
Presentative in your scenario
here are the scenarios in this
current conduct that would not
be allowed if you were a a
theoretical cabinet secretary
and you used your cabinet
secretary letterhead to say
please vote for this candidate
that would be a violation if you
i'll use a representative of
reams if you took all the
pencils and papers out of your
offices that were that were
purchased by the state and used
them for another campaign that
may be a violation I
for you as a personally I don't
believe that that would be a
violation.
Okay thank you madame chair
thank you representative and
thank you mister ferrer's for
the answer and so my
I remember a case from last
election cycle I believe it was
it was the former state
treasure I believe used
letterhead
to a pose at canada he didn't
like
and I believe the ethics
commission ruled again.
And so are we trying to say that
that penalty for whatever that
ruling was was not going far
enough I know that currently
it's up to five thousand this
would make that ten thousand is
that what i'm understanding with
this provision madam chair
representative manager
represented block on this
conduct act is not a dressing
that specific scenario it is our
penalties have not been adjusted
since nineteen ninety three
which I believe we have some
elected officials that were born
after the last penalty
of adjustment and so we we need
to keep up with that and that's
what why that.
Thank you thank you
representative I I think i'm one
of those elected officials.
I appreciate that that
clarification so i'm just going
to keep on going on the bill I
just think that that political
activity I mean it's good that
we're putting it in there I just
don't see white white we have.
Next year on page four.
This is new material.
And it says.
Underline for it says resources
of state and local public office
should only be.
Madame termine representative
mister ferraris do we have a
definition in the statute
somewhere that says public
interest I want to be crystal
clear that we ensure that that
is being followed
and thank you madame chair
representative.
Representative.
Representative mister
that kind of clears it up for me
I I like definitions I guess i'm
one of those people who need the
definition and there are just
cover our basis so I hope with
whatever the authorities of the
ethics commission york and.
Can uh
work out some case law in the
next few years once this is pass
so
I will go to the next page here.
Madame chair representative uh
this these are prohibitions I
believe using a vehicle owned or
lease by the state agency local
government and it says it does
not apply to the governor the
attorney general or any elected
state official so madam chair
representative mister
fares so this prohibits
I guess it it says the governor
the age and any state elected
official don't have to follow
this provision
is that what i'm understanding.
Thank you madame chair and
representative it is clear find
that it.
Your position requires such as
security detail or specialize
vehicle because of s.
The.
Madame think you representative
and I know currently I don't I
don't get a security detail I
would love one but I don't get
one based on the amount of
threats I get daily but
state elected officials that
would include us that correct
madame chair representative.
Madame chair thank you
representative.
So manamentary representative
we're state elected officials
should we clarify this to say
state wide elected officials
since we'll mention the ag but
then we don't mention every
other state wide elected
official in this new language so
it's kind of vague I could
potentially make a case in front
of the ethics commission saying
I need detail and security
because i'm getting death and
that could potentially
be covering me cause it says a
state.
Is that correct member.
Manager representative now
that's not cra.
Thank you madame chair thank you
represent can I get some more
detail on that from mr
just regarding the verbal why we
put the word
or attorney general and we
didn't wish the other statewide
elected officers.
Their jobs are a little.
Yeah.
Distinct from the other state
right elected officials
okay thank you madame chair
thank you representative mister
first so.
Then why did we put any other
elect.
If they're distinct and they
deserve this recognition this
specific.
I guess you could call it
compartm.
What other state elected
official would then qualify.
Representative.
Thank you madame chair thank you
representative so this could
include a cabinet sector you're.
A manager representative I I
hesitate to answer hypothetical
questions by as the stated any
state elected official that
requires the state providing
secur.
Okay thank you madame chair
thank you representative thank
you for those those answers i'm
gonna just move on a little
quickly here to the fifth.
Manager representative
it says indeterminate but
minimum minimally positive
amount of revenue do we know
what the department said back to
us how much this could
potentially cost us with these
extra fees that we're adding to
this and and certain other
changes in the provisions in
this legislation.
The representative
that the f fire you're asking me
if there's
information outside the fire as
medium to represent i'm asking
regarding
your conversations with the
departments I i'm guessing you
worked with the age's office and
the governor's office since they
are directly impacted by this do
we know if they said any kind of
changes to the wa would make a
fiscal impact to their
organization.
And now.
Thank you representative and
then
I appreciate that I just want to
make sure recovering the basis
when it comes to what this is
going to cost is this going to
be factored into the budget and
all that ones are so madam to
representative with this ten
thousand dollars i'm just
wondering why didn't we when we
tie this with c p I so that we
don't have to keep coming back
redoing the statute why did we
put a set ten thousand dollars
amount madam chair
and employment presented about
deferred to my expert witness.
The.
Okay thank you madame chair
thank you representative and
are we talking about the
department of justice that the
federal level or the newly
created department I believe
it's a department is that c.
Okay thank you madame chairman
thank you representative and
then lastly can we just can you
guide me through just in the
provisions in the bill which
mirror the hatch act to ensure
that we are.
Mirroring whatever that
legislation federally is madam
chair thank you madame chairman
representative it's on page five
from line three to line twelve
or thirteen
okay thank you madame sir thank
you represent so this brand new
language this is pretty much a
very beat him copy pasted from.
Yes manager yes representative
okay thank you madam churc.
The.
Yeah.
The.
Pass.
Representative ye.
The.
Yes
manager.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you madame did you just
say for me to start
thank you thank you madame chair
in representatives of members
i'm here to present HB twenty
two to my left is my expert
witness tick mason from the
legal women voters
I just like to say that the
league women voters in new
mexico believe that
responsibility for county
redistricting should be vested
and an independent redistrict in
commission with members ships
that reflect the diversity of
its opinion
currently county redistricting
is done.
Uh by
the very elected officials that
are affected and.
I come from a am now
happy to
serving my community is an
elected official but for many
decades i've served as a non for
profit so once again
public trust and III believe
that.
Ethics is not just being ethical
but also understanding that the
appearance of ethics and so by
having an independent task force
the bill before you is just a
very simple appropriations to
put together a task force to
create independent redistricting
processes so that is individuals
who are directly impacted are
not the ones making that
decision.
The.
I I will.
I will defer for questions.
My expert witness can make a
statement yes.
Okay
you know the secretary of state
league met with the secretary of
state she graciously agreed to
convene this test which if we
were able to obtain
an appropriation so i'd like
congressional and stayed off as
redistricting
in ca-
we just encountered
redistricting is not in the new
mexico constitution and that
means how he redistricting could
be standardized through
legislation.
And I just want to side coast a
couple of people vast me in
twenty twenty two this
legislature passed our elements
and everything for county
official.
In which the governor occurred
very I don't know exactly why a
dis in this session send the
composite as submitted
sb one seventy seven which does
exactly the same thing so this
is clear that the that
legislature can affect you know
there are behaviour of counties
uhm.
So.
Really going boundaries and back
your beliefs is inherent
conflict of interest with
elected officials drawing your
own district.
Just in the last redistrict in
cycle
county county registration
generated a lawsuits and send
one county and in sound of our
county uhm.
Initially the tip of the iceberg
the league has received
complaints from countries from
member from benefit voters in
throughout the state um of what
they consider unfair county
redistricting.
And so in twenty twenty one the
legislature passed the
redistrict in act that provided
standards for congressional and
state officers redistricting.
Some of those same standards
could be established for county
redistrict
so in closing I just want to
raise month it's just you know
the f I was just published this
morning
in this section here that that.
As a reference to uh state
athletes commission first of all
they weren't survey for this
particular legislation it does
say that all federal and state
regulations also apply to
counties well if people know the
US supreme court has punted on
state or anything other than
redistricting other than on
racial discrimination that's why
sound like sam one county's.
Was it was actually bright under
the voting rights act because of
just what what eight.
The voice was discrimination
against the nabonation that is
true but that is about the only
standard that stands.
So
it is necessary and we we we we
think uhm the secretary will do
a good job convenience to.
Making recommendations for you
to the counties are to this
party for how we could
standardize county reduced.
Yeah.
Hi my name's elaine summer hill
I am I am for the bill but i'm
also against the bill if that
makes sense he sends
the reason i'm against it it is
because there is no guidance as
to an end date for the for the
task forced no guidance as to
whom they report no guiding says
to home participates in the fact
task force
no mention of public meetings
and it sounds underfunded for
the work required and possibly
somewhat rushed
I think the ideas a good one I
just would like to see as a
taxpayer in voda.
Um
some guidance in the bill
that's all.
You're welcome.
Yeah.
Situation.
Was needed.
Sixty.
Tribal
adult but yeah we only have one
representation.
You know
I I think it's seat off of a
five.
I just want to urge support for
this bill.
Significant issues we see that
the.
Representative i'll defer to my
experience
um
did meet with the secretary of
state last april and she agreed
to do this I think what you say
in this she would it again I if
I are only come up this morning
so I didn't the opportunity to I
had to read it online uhm
I think what she's saying
delay on this
this will allow her between the
twenty four and twenty five
election it can be in this taste
wars
I think that was her statement
as I read it on the f I but we
did meet with her and she did
agree to you know convene in you
know and say that she can do
this and again given given the
appropriate you know given the
appropriation
again as you know secretary
state makes this she doesn't
stand in supporter opposition to
the legislation that she might
have what issues saying is that
she can
she can perform the function
it's given to her by the
legislation.
When we look at the FIR again
and other stand.
Locally jurors dictions are
subject to the same.
In.
I'm.
What.
I also you know.
It is it is a duty of the state
ledges.
Should.
And
you know.
Yeah.
Madam chair that was perf.
This task worth would be.
In.
Thank you manager and thank you
representative that's a great
other question this task force
is only for counties and it is
to create a task force that
would come up with a process of
how each county will be
redistricted and in that process
they may I am not going to be
member of the task force but
they may
come up with a process of using
local but not the individuals
that actually are going to be
representing the districts and
works they're creating.
Thank you
so I see that the appropriation
here is for fiscal years twenty
four and twenty five so it's
sensibly this task force would
begin at some point during this
year.
Like at a rough idea of start
with the task for.
Thank you manager and thank you
representative right it is it is
over this these fiscal years so
depending on this bills
implemented and then at the
process per se to get the task
force together but that they
have that leeway in leave way in
which to create this process
even after an electrician
that that's hopeful and then
what happens.
After the um.
Madame chair in representative
of members of the committee the
task force will be bringing back
information to our secretariat
state and recommendations on how
county why not state night
federal county wide
redistricting should be
accomplished
thinking.
Yeah.
Thank you thank you
representative.
Answers so far it's kind of.
But
i'm wondering two hundred fifty
thousand dollars
can you tell me where you got
the figure and
with previous tasks forces that
have been mandated to do certain
works such as this have they
been flended in the same
ballpark is this pretty much a
standardized number or did we
get this from a specific source
madam chair thank you madame
chair and representatives of
this very good question I will
defer.
We reactually reached out to uhm
consultant who have done this
type of work and in the past
mexico based
okay and um.
So they came up with an area
estimate to do a survey
and to gather all the data about
how count the various countries
do it of about two hundred
thousand dollars and so the
secretary thinking of
in other things she thought this
was a reasonable.
Okay thank you madame chair
think you representative and
can mister mason is that correct
okay I remember due from last
year and all the committees were
in there so thank you mister
mason so madame chair
representative mister mason.
So we said we spoke with the
secretary state on the figure
did we work with her on the bill
itself madame chair
representative.
A madam chair representatives of
the first my expert witness
madame chair representative
block.
She chitches seen the
slegislation and we we we passed
it by our by her office and she
had no.
She was fine with it matt madame
chair represented me and I
further is that this legislation
was developed through a
community efforts under the
leadership of the legal way
which is a non partisan group
women's they had the structure
they wanted to get input from
the secretary of state which
also advised them and what sort
of fiscal impact it would cause
under her department to be able
to oversee such a tax force does
that answer question
representative it does thank you
madame chairman and think you
represent mister mason so my my
big concern is regarding the FIR
she says she doesn't have enough
time with the implementation of
this so many material
representative I guess I would
suggest we change the the fiscal
years
to twenty twenty four through
twenty twenty six as suggested
by the secretary state on the
far.
And
madame to represent I went I
wonder could I move that forward
as an amendment to the
legislation to strike the word
and on line seventeen
and insert through strike the
word twenty twenty five.
So that would now read secretary
of state for expenditure in
fiscal years twenty twenty four
through twenty twenty sixth
madam chair.
Yes it is.
And the amendment madam chair I
actually don't think we should
change the
fiscal years here when it's
going to h.
Because.
I think it's pretty clear that.
Would not.
And.
Yeah.
We need to.
Yeah.
The amendment.
After the word twenty twenty
four.
Strike and twenty twenty five.
And then just because of how it.
Through twenty twenty six.
The.
I'm sorry about this we're going
to have to.
The.
The.
The.
Yeah.
Yeah.
