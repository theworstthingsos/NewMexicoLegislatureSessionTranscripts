Jeez thank you will bring to the
discussion today
we're going to start off with our
host we're very grateful here
to be on the campus of Central New
Mexico university
we have Tracy Hartzler who is
the president of CNM
and thank you
president for
brief for allowing us to
be here today and
we're grateful to learn more about
your campus and so
we will give you the floor
and thank you again all you
have to do is press that little you see
the little person with a little to
see that's what you have to do you'll see the
red light and will be
good.
There was no threat.
Same so use of its read we do not
speak so that's how
that's how we trained us I'm
sure that's how they trained me.
That might my team is in
our board so thank you well
I just wanna say with good morning to
all of you I'm so pleased
to host you here at our
campus one of many
campuses but certainly
it's a pleasure
to
help you all kick off
maybe your second meeting any of
your in terms of I know
how important your time is I
know how important public services
to our state certainly to
and our entire state given this
complicity really
thank you for being here we are so
pleased to welcome you here
chart comparte to our
campus.
I want to also take the
moment that there many of you who
are direct supporters of
CNM so thank you
for your time
for allocating your resources to
us for placing
your.
Face and I would say
your strong
encouragement and
support for our programs but
meticulously for particularly
for students are learners of
all ages
I we couldn't be as
successful as the
state's largest undergraduate
institution without your
support your leadership and your
guidance on
a not only during
the legislative session but most
importantly here during the hard work
in the summer that that you
do during the interim.
So for many of you you may not be
familiar with the NM
on I just want to give you some
highlights here but as I
did mention seeing them serves the
largest number of undergraduate
students in the state of New
Mexico so
what does that mean in 2023
this past academic year
we served more than 20
7000 undergraduate
students so those students who are in their
freshman or sophomore years including
dual credit students.
We also serve more than
4000 individuals
in our non credit or workforce
training programs as anything
from our CDL or commercial
driver's license programs
to a number of other
technology or training
programs.
We also serve more than
1400
individuals are dealt basic
education program which
is you know can be such an
important
transition for so many
of our working learners are
working adults.
So I know that you are here
to talk about for the next 2 days
to hear talk about learn
about trades in
particular also want
to focus on what we
do here and I know you'll hear from us
tomorrow morning and some of my
colleagues but
as many of you know it see them we've always
been committed to the trades
education and training we were
founded in 1965
as Albuquerque technical
vocational institute in
2000.
9 we changed our
name to central New Mexico community
college but make no mistake that
does not
impact or dilute
the emphasis of career
technical education here at this
college we have about
40 percent of our students
take career technical
education
courses so again we are
committed and doubling down if you
will on our trades history
here. We
offer associate degrees certificates
and workforce training and 16
fields that are related
again skilled trades manufacturing
transportation.
Our trade programs range
from carpentry and
welding off to
mechatronics in machine tool
technology to aviation
training as I mentioned CDL
or commercial driver's license
training.
Many of you may know for our vote
for our traits programs we
have advisory committees
so we work closely
with our employer
partners with our
K. 12 partners
are business owners
and our faculty and
students to really
analyze and make sure that
we are offering quality
relevant programming to
those students in those
programs we want to make sure that
what when our students
are are in the
program that they are learning
skills that are relevant that they can
go out to the work force and
again have workforce
experiences
whether that's an apprenticeships or
internships but that they can
be immediately
productive and see that connection
to what they learn in the classroom or
lab actually makes a
difference on the shop floor or
in a and manufacturing
facility like General Mills or
somewhere else so we're very
proud of the community
work that we are
undertaking with our advisory
committees we have them
certainly for those of
programs that have licensure
requirements.
Whether it's H. back or some others
but also we're branching out to make sure
we have advisory committees on number
programs they don't really
require licensure number of our high
tech programs
don't again don't necessarily have industry
specific credential but we want to make
sure that our local employers are
getting the skills and the
programming they need from
our from our
learners.
Many of you may know and when I mentioned
we're we're doubling
down on trades many of you may know
the last week and
really for last couple months
we've been able to highlight
our partnerships throughout this
region and
again thanks to many of you who
have committed
State Capitol
to our projects last week we
broke ground on the 61000
square foot
trades facility on
our main campus
that is in partnership with our
unions are employers that
came out of the community
based planning
session that we called reimagine the
trades that experience
3 years ago we
were all wearing masks
some online but really most
of the Center room as
spread out as this with our masks
walking around talking
about and and hearing what was
most important to our
employers are students that we're going
to make trades relevant and
meaningful and inspiring
to our to our
community.
That experience has resulted
in 3
distinct
efforts and partnerships and
facilities
one is our traceability that
are I mentioned last week
we also have a partnership with the
city the state
and C. N. M.
to
move our film programs
to the railyards here
downtown
as a mentioned earlier that's
also in partnership with
and similar to I'd say
furthering the the state's
interest in film throughout the
state so again it's similar
to the hub and spoke model
that I don't have a community
college and the state
are also partnering
on there and certainly with other work in
Santa Fe.
I think the other exciting
way we're partnering is that
third event
that is not quite ready to break
ground yet but I think we'll
the next couple of months
is our partnership with Rio Rancho
public schools
what's most exciting for us
and I would say Dr Cleveland was at
our ground breaking last week
here in Maine campus what's what's most
exciting for our governing
board my governing board of 7 elected
officials and
also the Rio
Rancho public schools board
last February
agreed to a really
revolutionary partnership
that.
The 2 of us
will work
together meeting we have joint
agreements both for facilities
construction for programming
for staffing.
And for running
a new traits facility
and trade center in
Rio Rancho and Santa Fe County
so as I mentioned we had a multi
year or a multi
partner planning session
C. N. M. we'll be moving
our automotive diesel
mechanic electric vehicle
programs from main
campus to
that site in Sandoval
county just across state
lines not Canada
still in central New Mexico
in our in our voting
district
in our geographic your responsibility
but we're really excited to have that
partnership we're building a
facility on Rio Rancho
public schools property
we are helping them with their
construction of the renovation
of a call center that will
provide many of the traditional
traits programs we
are committed together to
make sure that learners whether
they are high school learners or
adults who are learning in the
same building
same time of day same
instructors similar
curriculum or
same curriculum in some instances
but that partnership really focuses
on making sure high school
students are getting their hired their
high school diploma or their high
school equivalency
degree or
certificate but
certainly making sure that our adult
learners have the
opportunities
to access the same kind of training
program so we're really excited
about that partnership because it
really is
helping us better manage our
resources of time
of talent
we only have so many
instructors
and really are ever treasurer in terms
of our capital so it's a
tremendous
opportunity for
both
that I think others again
as I was mentioning with
Center hamlet I think there are other
opportunities for
colleges and and high and
high school districts or school districts
to really work together in this
way. Last I want
to recognize if you haven't
visited yet is our
our beverage and catering
program so again
because of local voters we
were able to renovate
and expand our
beverage our
beverage are both our wine
distilling
program and brewery
program here on main campus
it's a great place to
host events we couldn't
host a group this
large in that event but in
that space but it's really spectacular
learning experience
again it's a way for
individuals as again I
mentioned earlier it's a way for
individuals and our learners
to partner with industry
to learn how to not only make beer
or spirits
but to then how do you run a
bar how do you run
your own restaurant how do you
how do you work one of our hotel
industry there are so many
opportunities for people to expand
their skills or so please
that again with state
local support we're able to really
provide I would say inspiring
facilities that
no one else can find
but but community
colleges so I really
appreciate the fact that you are here
at our workforce training
center be glad
to answer any questions I am wanna
make sure I'm keeping you on time
as well but I just want to say
thank you for being here leading and
letting us host you and I look forward
to sharing more about what
we're doing specifically
in our partnerships with our
inner traits programs and
serving so many of our
underrepresented individuals in the
trade.
Thank you so much
we we do have an
opportunity so I know
Representative a copy at
all
let's go ahead and we
will ask questions and say
let's get until about
10451015
at 1050
so that we can trying get
close that but
I I think it's fascinating
that we this
is the thing that I noticed that our
community colleges
that are in our areas in our rural
areas with the branch campuses is
that they're recognizing
the needs of the community has
not just doing this cut
cookie cutter
approach to
providing education and
training
and you know
we we we I've already talked
with you about Kristin who's in the
audience and and the
restaurant program that we're
hoping to see in Deming
and the thing that I noticed
and community colleges throughout the
state is this willingness
to go ahead and partner because
you know the resources that you
have and
we know that those resources are
kind of thing at some point so let's
maximize what we've
got so thank you
for for doing what you're doing
and
you know I'm I'm excited that
learning a little bit more than
next time we'll have a committee
meeting and maybe
like a reception and and learn
more about the brewing and distillery
and distilling and
so I'm gonna go to representative
about coming out of first and then
Representative Lujan
anybody else want to ask any questions
Representative
denture. Thank
you madam chair and thank you for
your statement you
said a lot of what I wanted to
say so thank you very
much as the president
knows and others
I'm a huge fan of
us CNN but all community
colleges I
was I'm proud to say it
was one of the founders
of el Paso
community college
back in the early
sixties
I mean late sixties and
early seventies we finally got
a passed after several
bond.
Proposals failed but
we finally got it passed but
anyway I
am I'm also
very proud of
your introduction
of ethnic
studies
to get into going to studies in
particular at
CNM and I just want
you to briefly talk
about
how you're
integrating
the challenge gonna studies
into all of
the programs
such as the trades
and others but
we're here to talk about trade
so if you would
just give us a
little briefing about that thank
you. Sure thank
you Center and
and Representative I
appreciate your comments and your question
about some of
our.
To kind of to come studies
native American studies we have
other so we have other
that's a specialties or
focuses
to meet again are student demand
so I'm really proud that our governing
board again I mentioned we have
7 member elected governing
board it they
prove all of our
programs. And
that's very important
and so when they prove that program
a number of years ago again was
based on study on
research
on and
research not only what
students are seeking but
also what our university partners
also saw which
was if we want to have
a diverse workforce and that includes
a diverse workforce at our community
college but also at the university
level we really want to make
sure we are brought in who we are
inviting into liberal
arts.
And so when we started
these programs with very clear
partnerships and transfer
pathways because again we want
to make sure that anybody in these
programs
has that the
program is relevant that there's a clear
transfer pathway to a for your
partner because often times that's where
students will go and as for
your track with a bachelor's
degree and then off and on the
masters and graduate
programs so I'm
very proud of our partnership
funded by the mail and foundation
with U and M. and others
on that kind of pro on that program
such as the high level about
the growth of the program
and again what that means
to helping us I guess to diversify
our workforce at the college
level because we know how
important it is and research
shows that
individuals achieve what they
see right so
I appreciate our partnerships again that
we can work on
and again we've continued
to focus on
including all individuals
in our traits programs in
particular because again we received
Perkins federal funds or freeze
receive state funding to help make
sure that we support and are
attracting
recruiting
in addition some of those support the
some of the members here Representative
here have had given it
has given to us
so we have events like women in
trades we have a women
in trades conference every year
I'm so proud
how broad
the programming is the students who are
there participating
not only women but certainly
many.
Is students of color are
present and engaged
and again see
that. See
that event as a would be
part of a larger community that says
I can own my own business
I can go to I can get
a partnership right get an internship
or a paid
job while I'm in
school with many of the members who
are in that community so again we'll talk a
little bit more about that but
I appreciate the.
The the run what you
gave me a little bit so thank
you thank you
madam chair and thank you president
I am I am
particularly.
Excited about the
easy
transfer process
that has been
worked out between
in particular CNM and
UNM because I hear that from
the students over and over again that
they had very little
issues and the credits
were approved in transferred
so thank you very much thank you
madam chair thank you
representative Representative
Lujan.
Thank you thank you madam
chair.
And the representative for being
here and the
be part of this conversation as we
know we are looking to
figure out some of the
the ways we are going to increase
our workforce in our
state as we
have
a lot of capacity to
one build and a lot of
empty seats so to speak
in many of our
across the board and all of our
industry so
one particular we're at
work can be on the agenda for tomorrow
but I I wanna know how you
are integrating
incorporating our
population of
disabled youth
and adults in
your your focus
for the program here.
So thank you Senator
members the committee representative for your
question of
seeing them does have one
of the larger.
Accessibility
services.
A state department but
range of services in the state
given our given our
communities we
serve we have
thousands of individuals
learners who are engaged
across all of our programs
including the
trades.
Who need a types
of assistance special
services to
help them excel in their
programming so we
have made a
consistent.
We made a consistent effort
over the last number of years to
expand services to hire
more also
counselors or advisors
to hire more individuals who are able
to provide specialized services
whether it's in tutoring or
other accessibility services in the
classroom and certainly to work with
our faculty in our
instructors across all programs
and disciplines tell
make sure they are providing
the appropriate services and
access needed
to help our learners excel
it's a very broad.
Also a general answer
in terms of how we are allocating
resources to X. we're
allocating funds
to expand the number staff we
have to serve the
growing number of students who
have who
require.
Services and other ways
of it that requires to adapt
our programming
again it doesn't matter if it's a
liberal arts or trans we call
economic transfer or in the
traits we do that across the
board. Thank you
madam chair so I'm
gonna get a little more specific with you
because I want to know what are those numbers
of those populations in the students
particularly if you want traffic here
Mike as a thank
you
what are those numbers I'd like you to
really get focused in on this
as this is a demographic that is
that is essential to
how we're going to grow and our
workforce and it's been really
neglected and we're really
trying to to
acquire that access for
them and what you're partnerships
who are you partnerships how
integrated are they in
how you are transferring
jobs and
and making sure that they have the
information and
providing those
opportunities for
this demographic of our
our far disable demographic
really working with our youth and
starting their I
feel like
madam chair I did have
been attended the talks a task
force on our youth and and and
disability in our
workforce and so these are
the things as
I'm looking at policies across our
our our
state's
I'm honing in on New York New
York City particularly in the
programs that they have and
how they are creating that that
capacity by this
partnerships really
integrating them into the program the
educational
programming
and you're talking a lot about our trades
but it's not just our trades
it's all across the board with all
of our education our studies and
I really appreciate that you're talking about
the accessibility for
students that need
with testing and all those other
things because as a
as a parent with a child with
special needs we are
missing there that there's
a silent population
right many of
them are silent
population but how are
we facilitating that how are
you
recruiting
particularly as
you're bringing in
students from high
school into your
purpose here I really would like you
to focus in on that you may
not have the answers as you gave me your
a broad generalization
but I really need to start looking
at that and focusing in on that
thank you madam chair and
I'll see what I can prepare and
bring tomorrow so I appreciate your specific
questions and.
See we can what what kind of thing we
can run that tomorrow.
Thank you Representative
Herrerra and then Representative
Garrett.
Thank you madam chair thank
you president
I'm curious what salaries
are here at check faculty
getting these days
and
would what
salaries are here faculty
year tenured faculty getting
status sure so
thank you for the question center and
representative
our average salary
for faculty is in
the upper sixties.
And I apologize it's now
July
6
and so I'm trying so
and I say that because for the next fiscal
year. And we
have a we're in the middle of our
negotiations with our faculty
you so you may know that
we have 3 unions
on our campus one
for security one for maintenance
operations and the other for
our of this
central Mexico employ
you representative are full
time faculty are part time faculty
in our Inspiron
instructional technicians and
tutors all 3
of those
groups in
the central New
Mexico employees you
are undergoing negotiations
for that's 6
percent right now
so I will so
having said that when those
negotiations are concluded which is
part of our normal course of
business
the increase is up in the upper
sixties and I'll be
glad to get you specific information about
where they are today
and what
what that 6 percent look like going
forward I will tell you
the challenges with instructors
and so not
surprising
is that in state and we do have a
different to pay for nursing
faculty part time
or full time
again we don't have a tenured
faculty all of our faculty
our contract we don't relate
adjective Achal to part time
instructor part time instructors
are part time faculty so
different than the university
system.
So I can scribble
mortgages salary numbers
to Morrow
specifically because I'm on the
cusp.
I.
Looking for.
Now it's hard to say thank you
madam chair and and thank you for
that now look forward to that tomorrow I
know I know one of the big
problems is hiring people
in as instructors
in the technical
traits where they would make
90000 as a
welder
and and
that and part time
instructors so it's
it's a problem when
we're talking about really
expanding technical
positions and giving faculty
for that so I'm very curious
about how you're handling
this because I know this is a problem
statewide and
and they're really struggling
I know in the north
you know a guy working is
that beginning Wilder at the lab
makes 90000 a year plus
benefits plus
retirement plus everything
else and then our colleges
are competing for the same kind of
people and they can't they just
can't I don't know if that's your experience
here. I would
say Senator
members the committee representative that
that's precisely why we have
the agreement we have with Rio Rancho public
schools because we
couldn't possibly hire
the same number of auto
mechanic instructors Ortiz
mechanic instructors or
carpenters so we
really and the
provisions of that agreement and
our agreement between the 2
the school district in the governing
and seeing them the
college is that we
will we will hire
those instructors for traits because
our frankly our pay scale
is better than it was
in the K. 12 in that district
and how they're negotiating so
we're trying to find ways
within our
restraints to be
able to partner to do that
again either way it's competitive
it's very competitive and that's why we're
also working with employers
about a release program for how
do they really some of their
employees
and I think there might be
a. Some
incentives there is a tax
incentives there might be incentives
to employers to help them
release
employees to help
teach for some
period of time in the
trades in trades
areas and again we have them provide
professional development so
those individuals
are coming from the floor or
from a shop can actually be
effective instructors right because we
want to make sure they're still some call
that there is that they are able
to teach
effectively and be able to
make sure that those students who they're teaching
have the skills on
the oil and the outcomes that
they
the program should have so
it is complicated but I can tell
you were piloting some options
because of what.
Is what you articulately
stated.
Thank you madam chair thank you
president. Thank
you representative will finish up with
Representative Garrett.
Thank you madam chair thank you
president of my question
pertains to the there's many
short term excellent
programs one
week 40 hours that students
pay for sometimes up to
$10000 is
there any way that those can
be transferred into credit
bearing programs so they
qualify for the
opportunity scholarship
just sure so thank
you for that question Senator members the
committee Representative Garrett
of currently we
have we are able to use
unlike other community colleges are
able to access funds
the legislature we also
had appropriated
in FY 20 to re
authorize in FY
23 re
authorized for FY 20
for a broad use of
a $20000000 fund for
workforce training and
programming we're meeting with the
secretary tomorrow it's
been hard secretary of higher education
tomorrow it's been difficult to get
those funds to
institutions so I appreciate
that.
The legislature's able to broaden
the scope for how we can use those funds
but that's one way that we
will help individuals whether it's
through through that $20000000
fund that it
colleges of access to
to provide scholarships to students
in these high demand
high wage jobs
like commercial driver's
license
programs in
addition we have we of funds
or other federal funds that can be used
to support student scholarships we
work closely with our central New Mexico
workforce board to all
to provide those that those funding
opportunities.
We make sure it's the NM
and this isn't caught I don't think
it's as common but we make sure it's C.
N. M. that whatever we look at
a program and we evaluate
all of our programs every year
we identify them as fix grow
or sunset
we we eliminate 12
programs and you a year on
average we look at those
programs to say should they be offered
is not as a training opportunity
quickly and as a credit
program possibly
and we try to make sure that were
affording
we make sure that any training program
has what we call a credit for
prior learning opportunity
they can transfer into
our Kerry those credits are
competencies into
the degree program
and so that there isn't a loss
of.
We try to minimize the loss of
time for someone who's trying to
get a degree because
we know how important that is so we
have a pretty robust credit for
prior learning program
and that's what allows students to take
those training programs in
coding or some of the I.
T. programs to be able to get a
jump start on their
on their degree because we certainly
know that individuals who gain a
degree
over time generally are
promoted faster
are have a more
stable.
Employment pathway than those who
don't so again I don't we don't
look at this is an either or we look at
this is an item in the continuing
so we we try to make
sure providing the best
quality and best opportunities
first for learners to meet
them where they are but make sure that they're
always on a on a path that
allows them to
get that degree when they're
ready.
So. Thank
you madam chair and thank you present
if you could send the prior
learning information
to be leader I appreciate
it.
Great thank you so much I'm and
we'll get to hear more from you
tomorrow and I'm very excited about
that because you've you've kind of got a preview
of what the committee is interested
in and I do have to say I
was mentioning to Erin
how I think attendance by committee
members we're we're getting close to
rivalling if not surpassing
LFC so
what.
That's our goal
thank you so much
and you know I think what
we'll see really are
opportunities that you're already
taking but also we're going
to hear this and when you talk about
entrepreneurship
our next panel
we'll be talking about those business
owners and so I'm very excited
about that and it just kind of
worked out that they blend into
each other so I look forward
to to more what we hear from you
tomorrow thank
you very much president we appreciate
you and and we'll we'll
let you turn loose
and we'll make room we've got a
couple of our panelists are here very
excited about that
so move in so thank you and we'll
and again thank you for hosting
us here at CNN
we're very grateful
well our panel about
diversity in business comes
up we've got
for folks that are here
for at least 4
folks
and very excited about
that thank you very much
I would like to remind committee
members if you want to
get your per diem fill out your forms
to make sure you give those to Erin
or Martin or
Nicole.
Thank
you.
And Ernie
Aaron said that you needed to leave
at like 1130.
Level 40 would be
the latest time
okay well
another of local
elected official to
push her back 30
minutes well I'm I'm grateful for that
other elected official to
to to to be
accommodating
so we are working on diversity
in business and I have to say I think result
was you when you were
speaking
at the
Asian American Pacific
Islander Hawaiian
American day you push a little button
with the little person on it
that it was your speaking
that inspired me to think about
this panel
for this committee and so thank
you for that
what we have is of
you know we we often talk about
businesses
and we know that
and and I talk about this a
lot that small businesses and locally
owned businesses are the backbone of our
community but we
often don't actually look
at the different
groups that are representative
of our business community
and yet those are powerful
voices that are showing
entrepreneurship
innovation and
risk
that folks are taking
when it comes down to starting a
business but we also know that
there are challenges that these
businesses basin so that's why I
wanted to bring this panel

joint session does me high
you need to run for office
and I said absolutely
not so commend all
of you for

representing our state in our various
communities.
I want to tell the story
of myself just really really
briefly to kind of
show how
the Asian business collaborative came
in 2001
there was a little non profit
called Albuquerque
economic development
and Albuquerque economic development
had recruited a company
by the name of the gap
incorporated might
wear their shirts there and where
the socks whatever that may be
and when the
gap was looking to
recruit
individuals to start their
corporate services office
in 2001
my mom and my dad and
I my mom
and dad made the sacrifice
I hesitated
to come to New Mexico from San
Francisco California and this is in
2001 I
started high school here.
And lo and behold
what I didn't realize is that
I'm giving back to economic
development through
the economic development
teams that brought me here
I'm proof that
economic development
thoughtful economic
development works
so I've been a business
owner for 90 years now
work with all of
the folks here in some way
shape or form very grateful for the
experiences
but in in
2020
in March I have the panic
moment just like every other business
owner did and the
panic moment was what I'm gonna do
my employees because the
world is shutting down.
I was able to get my first
round of PPP funding in
15 days
thanks to dreams rang and other
organizations that helped
me be successful
in in receiving
aid and whether New Mexico finance
authority as well as B. A.
X. etcetera I knew how to go
through all the motions.
And then I saw the Asian
community.
In the position that they are
and many
our our sister organization the
New Mexico Asian families
had said we don't know where
to send Asian
business owners during the
pandemic they got
a they got a lot of phone calls and we
told them about the PPP
dollars we don't really know
what to do
so from there the Asian
business collaborative was
born but
we what I want to take a quick
moment if you want to go to
the second page
our board chair just recently
did a presentation along
with the black
chamber of commerce as well as
with the animal
BA
we we do recently did a presentation
to the Economic
Forum and
he put some really
fantastic
data together to kind of talk
about which actually segments
it's a great segue into the
entirety of the panel
what is the national projection
of racial diversity
in in our
country as we move
forward so by 2050
people of color really represent
half of the total population
more than half of the working
age population as you can
see here you've got
roughly my
glasses 29 percent
across the country Hispanic and
Latino roughly
4 of 14 percent
according the Kellogg foundation
is what I racial diversity
would look like and then
that the the
American Indian
at 1 percent obviously those numbers
are higher in New Mexico and 10
percent the Asian community
on the second slide I also
wanted to kind of paint the picture what
does the Asian community look
like in certain parts
of the country in as you can see
majority of
us are on the
west more than 40 percent
on the west coast
I'm so that's advantageous for our
general area.
We'll move quickly to the next slide
we're we see 2.7 to
1 in
addition to being racially ethnic
and more diverse as the years
come the
population is also aging
or approximately 2.7
to 1
we're sorry currently 3.9
we think in
2052.71
people are going to
be of the elderly age
would that mean Gen
Z. and
the millennials
are going to be taking jobs
in be predominant part of the work
force if that might make you
nervous especially
with my 15 year old son that
can't get off to
talk.
So what do the statistics we
were painting the picture that
shows.
That advancing
racial equity
especially in
economic development in
our rural communities
in wherever we might
be is incredibly
helpful and and we
all need to be thoughtful of
it especially
as the work
force is going to be changing
dramatically they're gonna be a more
diverse workforce
they're gonna be more open minded
they're gonna be more conscious
of pronouns
in respectful use of
awards in language
they're gonna be looking for
companies that are going
to be more
ethnically welcoming
into their various communities
and I'm not just talking about the API
community so that's
why we think it's
really important what does
racial equity mean
it means the that
we as a community
in society all groups have the
ability to participate
prosper and reach their full
potential especially
in economic development
and education but that's a story
for another day let's not talk about
Scotus state right.
And we see that there's a major
economic upside
right where we
reduce we have the
opportunity from
communities of color that we stand
in front of you today we have
the ability to reduce the skills
gap trillions of
dollars in greater economic
impact billions of dollars
increasing consumer spending
accelerated long term
substantial benefits
many of our organizations except
for us can actually show
like the Hispanic they can show
the economic impact
numbers of the
Hispanic community the reason
why the Asian community can't show it
yet is because we've
been underserved
and not given enough opportunities
in funding to put economic
impact reports together
that might be a force out of
but.
Seizure business collaborative
supports that right we
are 1 of the only
few states that don't have
an Asian chamber of commerce
until 2020.
And the Asian business collaborative
has helped and touched
over 300 businesses
in the Albuquerque area
also in various different
states however
the Asian business collaborative is
really committed
to helping business owners
with the cultural competency
lands.
Economic development
and social justice
racial equity finally
has it has a has
a intersection
that has never been seen before
for the Asian community
and I think today if if
we were in business 10 years ago
I'm sure Ernie
here
Kathy can say this like
we we
didn't see
the opportunity to
speak about
racial diversity and economic
development until
20232020
for moving forward
so we're
very proud that the Asian business
collaborative has been around since 2020
what we do
we help with
as a local and state resource
we have strong connections
with New Mexico taxation and
revenue
economic economic
development environment to health on
the state level we
also have been introduced to
local chambers of commerce to the
SBA they have rural
development committees so
we are aware of some of the challenges
that Asian business owners might have
in Clovis per
Tallis
or even in Deming
wherever they might be
we also supply case
management right
now we're funding has been
cut
unfortunately so we are
out of staff it's just myself
but when the funding comes
back the business case met
management will come back
and business case to case
management means we sit down with a
client and we walk them
through any situation that they
might be in but with
the cultural competency land
so for example 1 of my proudest
basis is
an Asian gentleman
who's of a Korean
adoptee.
He is a very
proficient on a third
black belt in
taekwondo
it looking your in your
communities how many taekwondo
schools are there
a lot but how many
of them are Asian
owned.
Not many of them so
we're lucky enough to have this
Korean adoptee
really harnessing the opportunities
to work with ABC and progresses
business forward
realizing that you
know there is that there is a
support team that's out there but we
don't replicate
what has been a does if we
can send people to his then we
will we've sent multiple
people to west we sent multiple
people to during spring we partner
the resources together
rather than recreate it
let's just build links the hub
and spoke model
right also provide
mentorship in that case management
but language access is really
key and I challenge
all of you to think about the municipalities
that you're in and think about what
favorite Asian restaurant might
be in Torrance
County or what
what what
Japanese business owner
might be opening up a
to a sushi shop of some
sort how great is
there English.
How how often can they
passed their health
inspections as a
what we found even in the City of
Albuquerque and they they made
monumental changes
is that about 25
percent of the people that were
failing
the health inspections
were actually Asian
and so once we started to
translate the
documentation and they started
to be more culturally conscious
of the conversations of Asian
owned businesses the
rate had changed they have a more
favorable impression
whenever they're out in
in whenever they're on
the field.
But of course what do we
need a from the state of New
Mexico.
I was gonna come up here and say that
I have a laundry list of
what we with the Asian community
specifically the business community
is a couple things.
Number one the API in H. cultural
center some of you are
aware and might have spoken
to former Representative
Kate a
bunker or
former city councilor land
Santa or even such
a my counterpart that spoke at the
legislature
we're we are looking
very aggressively
for funding for cultural center
we've asked our national delegation
for it about the cultural
center has
programming
specifically to the Asian
community
cultural competency
programming for us
at ABC we're looking for
opportunities for commercial
kitchen in classrooms
so we can teach our business
owners I've had to
personally front the bill for
ABC for offices
at the moment. I'm
so cultural center is also gathering
place depending on where it's put it
could be potentially the hub
in the hub for
further Asian
commerce if
it's near strip mall Asians
will typically follow
if it's in we
strongly suggest it for it to be in the
international district we know
that from the rural
towns people
come to the temple in
Albuquerque to prate
to worship to grieve
during funerals to get
married so Albuquerque is the
right place for
it.
While my counterparts are are
graciously working with their various
different commissions on the state
level how can the Asian community
doesn't have a commission of its
own.
An Asian commission
will be very beneficial to
advise the
governor on Asian American
related resources
advise the governor
on what are
the issues that the Asian community
faces that maybe not the
Hispanic or black community might
not be facing
most importantly the immigrant
population right the
8 the immigrant population the
refugee crisis that happened in
Afghanistan
our current resources
were flooded and didn't
have the capacity but a
commission would been
helpful so we can start
directing them to various different
towns and communities not just
here in Albuquerque
I'm obviously funding for our
organizations New Mexico
Asian families and
ABC but most
importantly spreading awareness if
you know of a business that
needs our help we're
here we're here to help
or have a help
here to lend a
hand no
judgment
right
and most importantly
coming from a lens of
the Asian communities on the model
minority myth now
doctors are not all
nurses were not
all
wealthy we're
here
to really support
the economy of New Mexico
and multiple different ways
breaker Syria types and make a
difference so
I think for questions at the end but thank
you so much for the opportunity to
talk speak
and I look forward to collaborating
with you on the future
thanks.
Thank you so much.
Earning your
next.
Well again thank you
madam chair and members of the
committee I'm honored to be
here
the monitor serving the role
of the presidency of the Albuquerque
small chamber just
kind like with Chris does a little
bit about herself little
bit myself you know I.
Work for PNM for 37
years last
15 is the vice president
government affairs
for PNM had a really good
staff you know some of them
yes I are in Matt
Carlos he did work for me
at the time but I know he's
here.
And let me just tell you
this
working for a
utility is a lot different
than small
business what I
gained when I
I was a granted
the opportunity from PNM
to work at this
point chamber for 18
months for free they pay
my salary they paid everything
for me so Alex
Romero the president of the
chamber at that time was very
grateful that you have
another person working there
but what I got to learn
is you know
the small business community
up it's blood sweat and
tears.
You know I hadn't seen it
before with retail the we get
paid every 2 weeks right
you have layoffs would have tough times
but for the most part every
2 weeks you get
paid a small
business the case
right I
remember one
particular auto
mechanical
outfit he had to
sell to his own personal cars
to make payroll right
those are the sacrifices people have
to make to
help their
employees
to keep their staff
it's it's not a piece of
cake and I tell you what
I don't know I'd love to
be able to own a business
but I think I'm I'm
too scared I think it's
rough so
if we go to my
presentation a couple
things I want to
mention.
Unfortunate
in my role up to
be with this
policy were we
are the largest
a chamber in New
Mexico
in the largest Hispanic
chamber in the United
States
that means a lot because
New Mexico is the first
of. Scott
middle of
states of minority
might major
state.
It's so you know we're 50 percent
Hispanic pretty much in
New Mexico pretty
much the same in Albuquerque
and so it's
it's great that we have a great
and thriving Hispano chamber
and a great board
and I'm honored to serve in that
role
so what happen
though was back in
1975.
There was 14 people that said you
know what we want to get
better representation the
other chamber that there at
just wasn't serving their
needs.
And so they decided to start
a Hispano chamber they had no
idea that all of a
sudden 48
years they have a
22000 square foot campus
in over 20 employees
and and have the reach
that we have it
was through their hard work and
dedication that got us
there. Of
we're fortunate on our
campus to
have.
The small business development
center located there
the procurement technical assistance
center located there
the minority business development
agency business center located
there and recently
a new addition is office of
international trade of the
from the commerce.
From the commerce department
that's all over campus so
we're kind of.
The the small business center
of at least central New
Mexico the New Mexico
of we
have a
convention and tourism
contract we had with the city
for 40 some
years.
We focus on the Hispanic and
minority
businesses bring in
tourism and
conventions
but proud to say that
in a month or so we're less than a
month Lujan lack will be here
there's gonna be thousands and
thousands of folks here downtown
Albuquerque because
of that really
cool
of conference
we're going to host the
2024 is a
world indigenous business
forum they're
coming currently they're going to
be an papel New
Guinea last year there
in Columbia and they're going to be in
Albuquerque we're very
proud of that
we're also working on
Malayo you all some of you
might be as familiar with
the layout of
right now we're Roberto Ricci
and another member of my staff
is going to New York I think delay
as a conference going on
we are working hard to
get them here 2025 or
2026.
And we also have the Latin
X. games coming here
2024 which
is kind of cool because
of stuff I don't do it
has to do with technology
and all that digital stuff
that's going to be really cool so we're very
excited for that because that's
generally in
California.
I'm really proud to say I'm in the United States
Hispanic chamber board
of the 21 members
6 are presidents
of chambers from around the
country
and because of my
involvement on the board for
the first time ever the
United States Hispanic
chamber. Partnered
with a local chamber of
Albuquerque chambers Boller
chamber and we hosted
energy summits the
last 2 years in Santa
Fe and we brought
speakers from all over the
country and
believe it or not and
this is something you all I
think about if you have a
chance and you want to understand more
about energy so
I contacted my former
lobbyist in
DC when we're
first having the first
Energy summit and
us to do that I need
somebody who's
not biased
one way or another I want somebody that
just really understands
energy set the
energy in the United
States in the world.
I need somebody like that
Representative because I I
really want that kind of a.
Key note speaker and
you said you already
she lives in Albuquerque.
Her name is melody
Canada and
so if you ever have an opportunity
to have her
speak in front of the legislative
body she will
talk to you about
everything that's going on about
energy from nuclear to
natural gas to
renewables some
of the pros and the cons
some of the real
difficulties of
how much how many
trends miles of
transmission lines are
needed to get to
the net 0 by
2045 how many
towers are
needed.
To me that's you know there's
a lot of things going on how
some of the men minerals and some of
the batteries are in
countries that are not friendly to the
United States how we gonna money
that I mean there's a lot of
things when we think about energy
so I would
really.
Of. You
know urge you all to do
that so the focus
of the chambers to grow and
scale small
business.
The next couple slides
are based on Salter hero
and you have with
you a present
article the soldier
Hugh wrote and
it was published in business weekly
in Albuquerque journal
last Monday soldier
Hughes a former
CEO of 3 major
companies throughout the world
and he started at a
conference called latitude
Latin slash attitude
and it focuses on
the Latino conte
and every year he puts on a
conference this year it's in Miami
then if you have a chance to go you should
go he
brings and presidents of
all the major
corporations and has fire
side chats with them.
Robin of Barack
Obama last year who
spoke it's a
great a conference
but if you
just kind of go through these
slides you might be
amazed and if you actually please
take the time to read the
article you'll be
amazed that the
fact that if we'll
Latino academy were
separate country would
be the fifth largest country in
the world that
if that
the highest populated the
most populated age of
a Hispanic is
11 the
most at highly
populated age of a non
Hispanic is
58 so
those those demographics
are changing the economy's
changed everything we've been
coming here in about it's
happening of
and I think so this
conference I'm talking about
is about the high
it's about good business sense
because what we find is
that Hispanics are
not in C. suite jobs are
not in boards and are
very under represented
in of
rules in the entertainment
industry in high level
roles so please
take it opportunity
to read that another funny
the fact that you might not care
about but for some of us we
do the number one
beer in the United States
is no longer but light
smoke hello.
Yep and
5 of the 10
imported beers are
Mexico the best selling beers
things are changing folks
so it
makes me especially proud
but it also makes be disheartened
in a way to think that we
still have to fight to get
folks in import rules I was
fortunate that PNM to be an
officer as a
Hispanic.
Of.
Anyway the other thing
that's a problem as you see
in 1 of these slides is
less less than 1 percent of
capital invested by the top
25 venture capital
and private equity firms of
2021 was
invested Latino Latino
owned companies.
Thanks to the change in
order that regard
so what about New Mexico
you know.
As I mentioned we account for 50
percent of the population
pretty much the same in
Albuquerque.
Of the 2020
to study the same study on talk
about so this latitude
conference puts out a report
every year every year
you can get this report that
shows what what the
Latino economy is is
kind of funny because I don't know
but people that are Hispanic or
Latinos or
he bottles are pretty regions
you know we've had all that discussion
for so I talked to solve
gun to come to our gala last year
I talked with the
order. What
do you call Latinos
the Hispanic or whatever
this is part.
He said I had this conversation with that
so you know San about
7172 years
old so I had this
conversation with that
many many many years ago
because he was you know what is proud
Hispanic right there from
space proud
Hispanic he
said. But
these that is father of
that do you realize
most of the people that came on the
boat were
then.
So.
What do you think happened
right so
we are populated with the
natives and the
Mexicans so he
says really he said the
easiest way to say we're all
looking
anyway
anyway we're the number one of
the state
of for Latino
dependent economy of all the states
and in the United States
22 percent
but also C.
N. B. C. study
right New Mexico 46
in America's top states for
business. So
there's kind of a.
I don't know what you call it the economy
on what it is we
have the
the best state for
Hispanic businesses and we're
driving the economy in the
United States and you
would think that New Mexico
we're still 46
in the state of New Mexico
sums wrong.
What I'd like to do is going to figure
that out so
we really are a test case
for the rest of the country for the next
3050 years we really
are in New
Mexico.
So.
You know back to it what crystal
said what what can we do a
wrote some notes here I'm gonna
kind of go through them.
So I kind of wrote this down a little while
ago so it is critical
that we diversify our
economy over
the next 10 years well revenue from
oil and gas is high we
need to really take a budget that we would say
that forever I had dark
here when we said we really
need to diversify our economy
we still haven't done we've got
to find a way to do it better
and we can take advantage of the out
flight the people from the east
and west coast to the southwest
southwest and also to keep
our kids here
we need to bring businesses
here we need to be able to have
businesses here to keep our
kids for moving out of
state we need to be
reasonable
in the way we regulate
business by not subjecting
them to burdensome
mandates that are
enacted in the piecemeal
manner.
Of we can get into that that we
could we also need to
break down barriers that are
currently make it difficult to
do business New Mexico
streamlined rules
and regulations that affect
businesses and get rid of unnecessary
red tape you wouldn't believe
how many board members I have that
say I have my
projects on delay
because the permitting process
is taking so long
they don't have enough inspectors
it takes forever
takes months and months and months
and all should do is take that I
mean everything is all the
paperwork filed.
We need to improve our regulators
interact with businesses from the
state and local level
so they have a predictable and
uniform regulatory environment
across the board.
We need to increase access to
tax incentives to streamline our
tax system so that it
is easier to navigate
expand programs like need
to up and leave the that help
encourage growth in investment in
New Mexico.
I really
wish
and I said this at
the
family medical leave
act when I had you
know like I think we had a
minute to
speak.
I would love to host
some help the
collaboration between
the legislature and
business community
to really care about what
needs to be done and
what the when we talk about
piecemeal legislation.
You know when we do I
know it's minimum wage
and then we do paid sick
leave and then we do
of family medical
leave all these things
it's almost like in a way to
death of 1000
cuts to small business
people. We
just need to do things
holistically and
figure out what help small
businesses and helps
employees because I
believe. Believe
you me business
owners want employees
that are happy
because they will be more successful
as business owners
we just need to figure out a way
to do it
collaboratively
before we're out there with
opposition and
people for in front of you
all and you all of
the judge and jury I mean we need
to figure that out for
and I'd love to host it
I'll be happy to do that
if we could figure out a way to do
that thank
you.
Thank you very.
Catherine.
The to hear from you madam
chair and committee
members thank you so much
for having me here
I have a like to start off
my presentations with the
quote that I'm gonna
leave you guys with from
James Baldwin
when he said he was in a
writer during the Harlem
Renaissance and
he said that not everything
that
is faced can be
changed but
nothing can be face
nothing can be changed until
it is faced and
up to date when we we
sit in these kinds of
panels where we're
talking about diversity in
business I was want to
put in the center of the room
that what we really want
to make sure that we
remember is that there is no
hierarchy of
oppression
I need the lord said that
that we don't want to
devolve our have
diversity devolve into
one of each philosophy
I'm hoping that
as we move forward in
as my counterparts have
talked about the changing
face of the work force
that we would move
beyond diversity equity
and inclusion to
humanism so that might
need to Representative
whether I'm in the room or not
so when I go into the room
I take all of
my my brothers and sisters
in with me
in those rooms so that what we can
do is see New Mexico at the
top of all the good
this we know that's not the case right
now so
what we wanted to talk about
today
from the New Mexico black
leadership council lands
is motivators to
support social
and for profit businesses
in New Mexico
that are black owned
so we want to faster economic
growth obviously that's
why we're sitting here in front of
this Committee
and black entrepreneurs
experience
discrimination
at higher rates than
than others of our
counterparts in
fact in the
hi is reason that that black
women say that they have decided to
become entrepreneurs
is because of this. Every nation
in the workplace
we also want to overcome
inequities we gonna talk about some
of those inequities we know
that they exist they don't define
us we want to overcome
them and we believe that there's a
path forward and we want to talk about
that a little bit more today
and with the specifically related
to New Mexico is
that we want to promote through multi
culturalism in New Mexico
the pledged
to our state flags is
that we are creating
perfect friendship
among United cultures
and I think it's very important
for us to think about how we
Lincoln leverage our resources
to see New Mexico be at the
top of all the given this we can't
do that without all
of us present at the
table to talk
about the things that
elicit that that try
cultural myth
that is been prevalent in New
Mexico for so long
that historically excludes
communities and people that look like
me I think it's something that
we need to face
as James Weiland said so
that we can change
it
so who is the New
Mexico black leadership
council.
Back in
2010
to 2010 I
think I
started The New Mexico Black issue
organizing committee
I had worked in
the public sector for
a lot of years I worked in
the nonprofit sector
and then I decided that the
leadership in the service that was
required of me was
to go out and see what I could
do to build and strengthen
the black communities from the
inside out so we started
this coalition
of like minded
organizations and individuals
who came together to say what is
it that we need to do to
advance the
conversation about
how black communities in New
Mexico could thrive
that we didn't just want to talk about it we
want to be about it how
we come together to do that
so fast forward a few
years later when the Kellogg
foundation came to New
Mexico they said they'd be here for
a generation they were going
to be supporting
the Hispanic community in the
native American Community
we have to once again knock on the door
and say what about us
we like to be included
in that conversation we
don't want to exclude anyone
else will we want to be included
in the conversation so
about 2014
we did a community based
participatory research study
called the asset study
and it was intentionally
a play on the words
assets a SS C.
T. S. but our city was
the us American Community
economic transformation
study assets
and it can we came out of
that study with 3
recommendations
1 was to create a non
governmental organization
the second 1 was to create a
leadership development institute
and the third 1 was
to create a
communications
network infrastructure so that
we would know how to
mobilize our communities in
times of joy and sorrow
as additional talked about 1 of
the big things and the
reasons why we have
some of the disparities that
continue is because
people don't know where to find
us we need to figure
out how we. Making
the invisible visible
in New Mexico and I think that there's
some really tried and
proven strategies to be able
to do that so
as we move forward
we created the theory of
change for the New Mexico black
leadership council that you see
there that that
talks about what we
could do to catalyze the blacks
of social profit sector
and this is our initial iteration
of how we're going to
operationalize
the recommendations from
the asset
study
in so once
we we got into it
what we thought is that
most of the what we
found was that most of the
organizations within the
the black communities were
primarily volunteer
led that most
of the businesses were
solopreneurs
they were not large
businesses and many of
them did not survive their
founders and
so you know we look at the
that to say that how
could an organization
like New Mexico black leadership
council help to
build and strengthen the communities
by complimenting
within easy the work
of those small businesses
and the work of those
volunteer led organizations
that have been historically
significant in our communities
so we we came
up with this theory of change and
that was our initial approach
we thought we had 3
recommendations that came from
assets and as we
move forward we
realize that it was
really only 1
recommendation which was to create
a non governmental
organization and that there were 2
set points and so New
Mexico black leadership council
changes mission to
read New Mexico black
leadership council is in Albuquerque
base 501 C.
3 nonprofit
working to foster sustainable
leadership and that's an
important word sustainable
create inclusive
opportunities develop
multi cultural capacity
and cultivate progressive
partnerships that support
black communities and
benefits all New Mexicans
we have 5 areas of
impact advocacy
and civic engagement positive
youth development cultural
vibrancy. Leadership
and workforce development
health mental physical and
financial and in the
center where
we discover that we didn't really
have 3 recommendations we
had actually won would to
some point with that
we have to have a collective impact
organizing strategies so
that we can continue
that we need to figure out how
we we bring
together those
individuals and organizations
and small businesses within
the black communities to build and
strengthen from the inside
out and we also
had to have a very
strong
communications network
infrastructure to be able to
mobilize our communities
in times of joy and
sorrow and that we have to
have those things in order for
any of these 5
areas of impact to
work so how does
that that affect our
businesses so if you
look at the black and social profit
businesses footprint in New
Mexico according to
a 2020 few research
center data of
black businesses comprise
less than 1 percent
of the businesses in the state
now we know that the information
that we get coming out of
census data and from
those surveys they get
sent out to businesses if
they know where
people are are
very very
inaccurate and
blacks comprise
according to the 2020
senses of approximately
2.7 percent
of the state's population but that
does not take into account
2 or more races or
people who identify
as black also
if you continue on the historic
in equities like in the work
force of black
an African Americans
labor force participation in
unemployment rates by race and
ethnicity 2018
data shows
hi disparities in the black
communities and other communities
of color and those things
have been asked exacerbated by
the pandemic
and then if you go on
information where people get information
from the New Mexico
business first has a book of
lists if you go to their book
of lists historically they have
less than 10 black.
Businesses in the entire
state listed in their
book of lists so we talk to them
about that and why that is
they want our help
but there's a
song that I'm a vocalist
also and there was
a song that was a parity
awhile back this is we
don't work for free you
know we have to
be funded
to go out and do this kind of
work to be able to
get the information
out into the communities
of so that we can be
better and that we can see New
Mexico at the top
of all the good list so we
know that the challenges
for black businesses in Mexico
are the challenges that every
other businesses face
every the business space
access to financing
access to business education
access to mentors and
supports as it
says and then there's another
thing that I think is really important
is that we really need to focus on our
young people
that there are 63
percent of black
millennials who want to start
their own businesses and they
need to be able to overcome
those barriers
of the person that you see on the
next slide is madam CJ
Walker
Sarah Breedlove she actually has a
connection in New Mexico and she was
one of the first black
African American
millionaires and she works
in the
cosmetic industry
and see have this quote
about what we need to do to level
the playing field she said
I had to make my own living
and my own opportunity
but I made it don't
sit down and wait for the opportunities
to come get up and
make them and so that's what we're
trying to do I
what we are doing in
the black communities
there's a couple of other slides there the
talk about the workforce development
ecosystem I think you guys
all have seen those you
know what that is
and there's a whole big
ecosystem that we have
start have historically not been
part of that we want
to be included
within and
also crystal talked
about the fact that education
was a
a topic for another day
I think it's a topic every
day that we have to talk
about education. And
the fact that we have to create pipeline
so that we have people to work in
jobs and we have people
who are equipped
at to start their own businesses
I just giving you
some of the proficiency rates
from schools in the having
cluster in the
international district in Albuquerque
where our offices
are that
our prices level that we have
to always remember
Cathrynn hold on just a second
RT and a you have to go
if there are any questions from
the the the
committee if you will
jot them down you can email them
to Erin she will
get them from Ernie she'll
send that to that and we'll get those
responses.
Along with a few more
no no no no I don't want
to catch up I want you to finish I just
I know he has to leave really quickly
so thank you for being here we appreciate
that all right thank
you so much yeah and thank
you.
So I'm you know I'm I'm really
excited to be here sometime to get
it all in in this
in these few minutes but I hope that
this will be the last time
that you bring it in the room as
are any said I hope that we can all
come together and
lock ourselves in a room and
that leave until we come up with some
solutions about what
needs to be done
there is a New Mexico
black chamber of commerce
kamikaze
from the
it's it would have been called the
greater African American
greater Albuquerque chamber of
commerce is now The New
Mexico black chamber of
commerce and and
what we want to do is to
be able to work directly
with these organizations
and for you to know that they
exist and the work that they're
doing around
the communities
so in in terms of next
steps ensuring diversity
in business we need
data development we need to be
able to share out that
information
in your packet I included
the black owned business directory
that we host of the New
Mexico black leadership council
site there are more than
10 black businesses in
the state of New Mexico
we need to do something about that
so that people understand it
we also need to understand
that the
organizations like New Mexico black
leadership council it is
also a business
we are a social
profit business and
we work to build and
strengthen the black communities
from the inside out to
better
Services and and
the the state of the
state for all New
Mexicans so thank you very much for
having me thank you
so much Kevin you can totally tell
your passion as I
think of all of you it's you know
when you when you you do what
you do to do to
get excited about it we can all be so
fortunate to be really that
enthusiastic about
what we do for a living so thank you
very much Marvis
love to hear from you as well
Sir.
Thank
you.
Thank you madam chair
and members of the committee
for your time today
and especially for your
interest in
convening us here
as representatives of the
different
business organizations were
part of but also
a part of the different
populations in New
Mexico
as the executive
director to the American
Indian chamber of commerce
one of our initiatives
is of the native
economic advancement
development initiative
so
in your in your packet
so I'll be speaking to
those slides
part of that
initiative
so.
The I'll refer to the slight
numbers which are in the bottom
left hand side of each
slide
so just like
to just gives an
overview to
the chamber our vision is
native business success
our mission are
to achieve
successful economic development
initiatives one Corporation
strengthening and building on community
and tribal values
so as indigenous and I'll
be using indigenous and native
interchangeably throughout the
presentation
we what we've come this
find in
our
theory of change model
as was referred to
earlier we
have businesses
at different levels in different
areas different
sectors so
we're pretty diverse
but they're still a
central
business or economy
that centers around cultural
tourism of course
here in New Mexico
as I
guess what later became New
Mexico as as
the first inhabitants of the area
and with this mindset
of always welcoming
people in
and that really ties back
to of the
purpose and and
also Kathy up in
saying I'm not here speaking
on behalf of any particular
tribe or
tribal nation
certainly the tribes nations and
publish have their governments
and they have their leadership
having served in that capacity
for money tribe
of Aqaba
years ago I I've I've
learned to just be able
to yield to that
perspective
as sovereigns in the state of
New Mexico
each have their own
way of viewing things and
again I'm not speaking on behalf
of any particular one
so in this fulfillment
of purpose in modern
times gosh global
pandemic
affects everyone on
the planet and
affects environment
affects animals
affects many
different things
and just like everyone else
you know we're working to move
beyond that
and our businesses
our child. Engine to for ways
in different forms
and yet still holding true
to their purpose their
mission whatever
those businesses
and nonprofits as
well make up our
chamber the in
serving their purpose
it ties back to
the culture and heritage
purposes
of each individual
and again those
communities of
that that are that are
served so we work
to find balance in that and the
need initiative is one of those
ways we work to provide
balance on the next
page on slide
3
represents the areas of
focus we is the
chamber have centered
on and these
items or these areas of
focus came about I mean
speaking with our
membership businesses
I help many one on
one conversations
and this was sort of our needs
assessment if you will
so the areas of
focus business development
is about bringing buyers and
sellers together I mean it's
very basically that's
that's what we do
capacity building there's 3
areas of capacity building
help the business owner to
scale help the
organization be
ready for increased
opportunity and
3 is access to
capital so
capacity building centers
around those 3
workforce development I've
centered much of this presentation
on that particular
efforts all come back to
that one.
Education as
was stated earlier how
can we not have a good conversation
without involving education
and economic aging
thank you to of president
a CNM for
hosting us today or one
of our partners that we
up want to
continue working with moving
forward along with all the other
educational institutions
including our
public school system
which I'll speak to here in a little
bit and finally
a research and policy
as we look at
the.
Leveraging the experiences
of others as far as
best practices
of the research
component has
mostly been led by our
interns
to look at different aspects
of economic development and
economic opportunity
as well as different
policy that has been
helpful to better
positioning economic
events been an opportunity
for indigenous
peoples certainly the
state tribal collaboration
act which is
one of those I'm proud to have
been part of back in the day
I served at the
department of Indian affairs
in Santa Fe and
thank you for many of you
your support in that
and as
the. Governor
and leadership of the
state convene annually
for that meeting that's mandated
under the act of we
want to continue to see economic
development as part of that
conversation
moving forward
so the need initiative
on slide 4
of the intent is to build
capacity in tribal areas
statewide to foster economic
growth create jobs
and support the community
so this concept really
comes from a
thinking within our
communities how are we supporting
each other and
as so for the most
part tribes nations
pueblos in New Mexico
being matriarchal matrilineal
societies right
in our story
one of our stories
of all people of the
planet
are indeed related as was
shared earlier and
we each come from a mother
and the mother's in the
beginning we're sisters
and so all
faces and peoples of the
planet have that
connection and
that's our belief and
it is conveyed
much in our house
hospitality to
welcoming people to feast
days or other gatherings in our
community because we
are family and
so in progressing
the need initiative we focused
on workforce development
entrepreneurship and
business development
there were 4 goals identified
as part of that needs
assessment I referred to
earlier so the goals
are on on page
3 slide I
there's 2 goals their support
workforce development
and I just included
3 different ways we're doing
that currently S.
the American Indian
chamber of commerce
preparing for job success
is our training for job
seekers it's a 5
session series again
I'll dig into that a little bit
deeper further in the
presentation skills
for succession planning
this comes from business owners
looking especially soft
skills how do
we relate
in our work center in our
workplaces
just people's. Individuals
how do we manage
differences conflict
how do we effectively
communicate how do we
problem solve so
these are
attributes of workers that
business owners have identified
needing especially
moving be
on the COVID.
Supporting our workforce
training is for employers
we're this is under
development currently
we're anticipating so 4
sessions series
and it really spins off
of our
workforce readiness
wraparound support model
that we've developed
and we'll get to that in a
second but
how can employers
also be part of
employee retention
and ensuring employees
are to
empowered self
empowered and really
performing to their potential
well keeping families
happy back on the home
front Xcerra
go to is improving access
to capital in
our
of better
understanding of the subject
area we've
acknowledged that financial
literacy training at
a basic level is
probably where much of our
constituency is
that
what's our relationship with
money how do
we build
assets and for
much of that conversation the
question is what what our
assets
so it's it's breaking
it down to a basic
level and then building up
to access
to capital be a traditional
lending or other different
types of sources that are out
there spending and
savings plans establishing
credit worthiness and borrowing
money are part of
those
training topics that that we've
included. All
3 on slide 6
is develop business leadership
and organizational
capacity so we
do that one of the ways we do
that is through business growth in a
changing economy training
for business owners and
leadership.
This was a little bit longer it's a
10 session series
we took this out we pilot
the training out in Zuni
pueblo and
we partnered with their main
street a
program out there and
and it was a great
conversation to have
with many artisans
and individuals
involved in current cultural
tourism as you know is
any public so it'll bit off
the beaten path so
but never the less the they
capitalize on their strengths
and that was much of the
conversation that we
had with those business
owners so
the business owners
themselves identify areas
that they could use more training
in so it was very
much also a needs
assessment of sorts
go for us promote business
growth of federal contracting
another national business
opportunities
so 2 of our sessions
that I mention in in this
presentation our business
growth through contracting
and this is really the
introduction to government
contracting agency specially at
the federal level something
known as the body
Indian act and perhaps some
of you are familiar with
that and
if you're not don't be
too
of you're not you're not
alone of the many
of our business owners
native business owners didn't
know about the by Indian
at so in our
research again
identifying some of these
federal policies that
can be helpful
to better preparing
businesses to participate
in federal government
contracting so this
was one of our trainings
well a couple of our trainings
preparing individuals
to take of those
opportunities and
again position themselves in
the position their businesses for
long term success
there are other
types of
policy driven
initiatives such
as the small business
administration's 8 a
program that probably many of
you are familiar with
how do we ensure that
businesses will become
a certified are
successful for the long
term so
much of that. Conversation and
content is included in our
training so those are the
4 goals of one of the
initiatives of that I'm
focusing on in
today's
conversation.
So the next slide slide
9 digs
in.
I'm sorry slide
7 digs into
workforce development training a
little bit deeper so
again this is a a 3
series
training.
The 5 sessions in series
one are
are listed there the titles
for each of the sessions
we we dig
into
worker reading this a
little deep and wide
of for example we do a
mini visioning session
asking participants
to create a life
vision where do they
see themselves in the future
what kind of work are they
doing why is
that important to them
we're connecting them
with their passion
with their talent
power we introduce the
notion of talent power
everyone's got a talent power
right so we loosely
defined talent this knowledge
plus skills plus
added to.
So participants
connect with their talent power
how was my talent power
helping me attain
employment so
for the
beginning training
of how do I take my talent
power on to job
applications
onto my cover letter
in to keep in
in on to my
resume and
articulated during the
interview so I Sir
Keir employment but
I'm also able to
demonstrate performance
as I'm selected for
employment so worker
rating agency has been
around that
idea of preparing
our workforce currently
and preparing the workforce
of the future we
talk a little bit about
the continuous
improvement and
a brief introduction to
personal financial management
we don't actually do a personal
of of budget in
the session what we talk
about analyzing our
spend so
our need to have
some verses are want to
have of course my money
going and we
talk a little bit about so
the we put in a -
of life skills we
talk a little bit about
this idea of
work and
what my compensation
targets might be
relative to the quality
of life that I'd like to
have and the way
of life that I currently
have so we work to make
that connection so participants
can see
that their
choices now
especially with the high school
demographic
their choices now affect
their future and their
livelihood could in their
their life
vision so we
we incorporate that as
part of the training
and lots of all
Hall experiences and light
bulbs going off it's a wonderful
experience especially
with high schoolers which
up I'll speak more
about that in a minute.
The second series
again of the soft skills
and I won't do
again I mentioned a lot of the
topics already in the third
series is the wraparound
support model which is
slide 8
and so
are our
worker readiness model is
is shown their
talent power we feel as
a connect helping
people connect with their talent
power is part of that
work for rating as were
does my knowledge
center on what are my
skills like what's my
attitude toward
work because work
ethic has changed is
what we're hearing from many
of our business owners some
of them very frustrated
some of them even to the extent
of being upset
that work
ethic has changed
and so we empathize with
that certainly well how do we
affect that and
so having
this part of our training
people I can knowledge in what
what is my work ethic
how do I value
work and
deciding for themselves
what their work ethic
can be like in
identifying themselves
as part of the economy
big picture
so knowing industry and employer
needs so we also
acknowledge that to be part of
the formula or what's out there
what employers need
we did a little a few
enquiries now mind you
we're a team of 2 people in
our chamber it's
myself and my colleague
so we feel like the little engine
that could sometimes
but we we're we're still
making an effort here
so it understanding employer
needs moving
beyond COVID lot
of remote workers out
there right hold
for organizational culture
has changed many
of them just this described that
change many of them have been
fearful of that change
hello my managing performance
now of remote
workers when they're
not at their desks
or their cubicles were I
can see and
knowing that work is getting
done so how has
a leadership and management
chain. Change as well
so we're digging into those
increased
development education
and training being part of worker
reading this again hence our training
that we have our partnerships
with U and M. and M. S.
use Sippy
hi in the list goes
on with the
institute higher education
institutions are post high
school institutions out
there job coaching
and mentoring employers
how can we help employees
be successful how
can your leadership
specially frontline
supervisors
ensure that every
employee who's been selected
for employment is
successful with the
unemployment
so that's part
of our training.
The idea behind wholistic
wellness and we know
there's this foundation
that everyone has a person
has to have been feeling
well
physically mentally
spiritually
socially and Senator
is this Moscow's hierarchy
that we subscribe to
hello my progressing myself
to self actualization
hello my preparing
myself to be the best that
I can be so
incorporate that in as part
of our training as well
involving other
organizations
and finally support services
and for lack of a
better description
this these are identifying
hurdles that workers
must overcome to be
successful with their
employment such
as access to
childcare
especially in tribal
communities they
may have a early childhood
development program they may
have a head start program
but it's not often to
have day care
services as a
business opportunity
perhaps for some people
so how can we
create that
opportunity for would
be but business owners
and service the need of workers
as well is
one of the the
needs were working to address
moving forward another
example of support services
transportation
there's not much public
transportation and tribal
communities especially
they may have a shuttle
service to
move people around or take
people to a grocery
store to the pharmacy
perhaps but as
far as public
transportation
there's not much
many of times in my
throughout my work career
I picked up people hitchhiking
to work
so they could get their own
time and show their
talents as part of the
organization they're
employed with
so those are a
couple of examples of support
services that we've
identified to be a part
of our work worker
wraparound support
model that we're just
flushing out the system.
Thing you for us is the
chamber so it's a
model that's.
You could continue to be
refined.
The next slide to support
supporting worker rating agency
so we're we
going is the chamber
moving for we want to continue
collaboration with tribal
education departments
and the we owe a programs
we've been asked by many of
the tests to use that
group to provide
our workforce development training
that I described earlier to
their high school students
we started out in Zuni
and we were in bay we
just last week finished up
at St for leafy staff
really people below we've been
the heinous we got Santa
Anas and you're coming up
here pretty soon
so they've reached out
we've heard about your workforce
development training we
wanted for our high school
students so we want to
continue
that but we also
want to reach there will a
programs and other we will
programs throughout the state
of national Indian youth
council has a we all
program that we're also
in partnership with how
can we create these job
opportunities for
individuals collaboration
with the New Mexico education
and higher education
departments of
community colleges
are part of our next steps
as well we were
invited to the New
Mexico higher education
conference over at buffalo
thunder as part
of the gear up program
which you know is somewhat
funding you all approved
we were there to
share a little bit more of our
workforce development training
and there's a little one page
that I'll refer to here
in a minute a develop
effective strategies to intersect
indigenous culture with target
social economic
outcomes in areas
like business start
ups educational
outcomes and holistic
wellness so we want
to be that
conduit.
To tie together
indigenous culture
our way of life our
beliefs our
values our
principles
and how do those affect
social economic
outcomes
results
impact how do we address
poverty for those
individuals who want
a different quality of
life how do we
address education.
What's the
secret.
Is there a secret.
So we're about
discovery as
the chamber and we're looking
for partners to
make those discoveries
with. Funding
support for talent
capacity in areas like
research curriculum development
indigenous training
facilitation are
some of our needs
development of worker rating
agency wraparound support model
that I described earlier
paid
internships.
Strategic planning
strategies to achieve
readiness or our
starters initiative
which is up and coming
other need initiative
goals
so our target
participants for much of our
training currently have
been high school students
and current workers and
employers
and workers seeking
employment.
Slide 10 is a disk
brief description of
creating opportunity amongst
change through our strategies
to achieve reading
this.
The global pandemic
surprised
many.
I heard from folks
this will blow over in a couple
of
months.
But we
remembered.
The words from our
elders
and those who've gone
before.
There can be global
challenges
that no matter what color we
might be no
matter what.
Economic social status
we might have
it's going to affect everyone.
And madam chair.
Members of the committee
it did.
And so how do we
collaborate moving
forward how are you
ready.
You got scary not finding
meat but the meat I'll.
Or toilet
paper.
You got scary.
When we saw children
outside their community
libraries.
Hoping for
an internet signal.
So they can go to
school.
You got scary
when there was no more water
we turned on the
faucet.
And so
infrastructure.
And certainly part of the effort
moving forward.
And we work to
take advantage of the
grant opportunities that are
in but
even.
Grants and contracts
management is a
capacity area
many of our tribal
constituents
need support in.
How do I write
an effective grant
applications
and once I receive the funding
how do I manage that
grant and write
those reports
and demonstrate
impact.
And have an effective evaluation
system. So
I can show funders
and in many cases taxpayer
monies from the
philanthropist money's
this is how
your support the impact
to our people
our communities.
So contracts and grants management
is certainly part of
the stars
initiative.
So as we work to sustain
our ancient economies
are trade
economies
that center around
the creative for a guess what's
become known more so
in mainstream as the creative
economies are
arts and crafts
part of the attraction that
brings people to New Mexico
to experience.
Santa Fe Indian market
probably one of the most
economic impacting
activities in the
state and
people coming to
see indigenous
people experience
their culture.
Cultural tourism
the gathering of nations
the balloon fiesta
and the pre New Mexico true
experience the
emerging economies
broadband infrastructure
renewable energy
the stem and steam
economies.
The buy local and buy native
initiatives
the support that we received
from many of you
to be able to
acknowledge.
Native owned businesses in New
Mexico
as New Mexico
businesses when
that wasn't the case
before so
thank you for your support
in that effort.
So in closing
the.
Last a reference making
and will speak too much to
this is
our one pager
on the
the impact that we've
had so far with our
workforce development
training it's been
very well received by
the tribal communities
and ultimately by the
participants the high school
students who are
engaged and
fulfilled in
economic aging their
potential and
working in that direction
to be the best they can
be so madam
chairs members of the
committee thank you for your time
and attention.
Thank you all so much for spending your
morning here with us
today I'm
incredibly grateful and humbled
by what
you are doing in the community
and and
no really kind
of what you all have to go through I'm
the CEO and president of the Los
crucis green chamber of commerce
and we talked about the importance of
locally owned businesses
we talk about the importance of people
planet and profit.
And during the pandemic
you know we saw the
small business development center
we saw the Economic
Development Department of our communities
we saw our chambers of commerce
our business serving organizations
really rally together to
try and find ways to help
support our businesses in the time of
panic because
not only were they worried about keeping
their doors open they were
also worried about supporting their
employees
and we all felt the brunt
of when the supply chain is
interrupted and
these folks on the front line of
that of trying to make sure
that they provided and what we
found was that
our small businesses
are local businesses became
very flexible
very creative
we had many restaurants were offering
family packs to go curve
side service remote
working but we are now also
working with a new
normal.
In terms of how do we support
our workforce when
a pandemic a global
pandemic brought
us challenges and
ways to work
differently and in some
cases work
better.
And we have to have says flex
time we have to understand that there are
people that are working better from
home and they are working in the
office and
Mars you mentioned like how do
we gauge that how do we
gauge that productivity and
I think that's an exciting
even though it seems like it might be creating
a little bit more work it's an exciting
area for us to be in because
we have the opportunity to not
only is is
is earning was talking about
is like supporting our P. a supporting
our employees but also
making sure that our our
our businesses thrive
and that's where we are we're on the
precipice of what we
can do as
not only business owners
and community members but how
can we do that to where we are
literally up lifting
both of those right so that
we are businesses can thrive
and our employees can stick with us
because we know what locally owned
businesses we know that
if we can keep an employee
that is a family
member it's not just
an employee it's a family
member and
so. The
grateful for our local businesses
community and especially
those communities of color because you
also have extra
challenges
because of of
systemic issues
that often
put communities
of color at the bottom
and so
I think we have a lot to learn
from each other
and allowed to benefit from
those with that resiliency
that our small businesses
provided so I just wanted
to to make that comment we do
have some questions we have Representative
Lujan you want remind you
all that we've got 1 coming in at
about 1230 but we can go ahead
and extend that just a little bit but I do
want to be respectful of your time
I appreciate you being
here Representative
Lujan to
increase.
Yes.
Hold on a second if you need to say
something yes I'm so sorry I just
wanted to know the invitation
also went out to the New Mexico
out business alliance
they want to recognize them in the
conversation because there is
a coalition among
the black chamber myself in
the invitation has been opened for
the Indy chamber Hispanic chamber
we created it a
coalition called the New Mexico
business diversity
coalition and and the purpose
of it is that we can all show
the power numbers I'm
so I just want to make sure you you brought
up you know the New Mexico Los crucis
being chamber New Mexico
out of course is very busy with
pride and I
while I can't speak for their organization
it is important to note that
they even have their challenges
with the transgender community
being incredibly
I'm discriminated and
LGBTQ chamber or the
L. T. G. G. L.
G. T. L. G. B.
T. Q..
As a raging lesbian
I I and I know
that.
Philadelphia veteran and and I I
say this because
the
the purposes only have
studies on the R.
Y. of their
community and they're one of the
largest spying
powers in the
nation including in New Mexico
is also that's important to note
but.
Yeah I just want to make sure it
happens I thank you
I I appreciate that I was
trying to to navigate that
is is an out queer
person and also a business
member so Representative
Lujan then Representative
Martinez
Representative about coming
at here the first 3
up so again
I'd like to remind committee to keep
your questions on track
and be aware of time.
Thank you thank you madam chair trying
to keep my everything on track
here I and I so
my questions really we're going to go
towards the Spano
chambers and I was really
intrigued with the
the data and statistics that were
given through the article I think
that this is one of the
you know
alerting
pieces of information we we
have as far as as the
statistics for data
and just knowing where we are and how we're
navigating the other thing I wanted to
really just kind of dropped since
he's not here I will say my questions
directly for for the
chamber.
But also being from Santa Fe
are are Santa Fe Hispano
chamber making sure
I really wanna appreciate you
you
created a coalition but
please make sure that it's not
just Albuquerque that
it's all of
yeah.
Yeah it's difficult The New Mexico
all diversity
yes thank you madam chair really
appreciate that
we're working on a lot of things to
in in no
and
just addressing how we need
to come together on policy so
I guess my general question before the
panel right now is what
are the what are the
specifics on policy
initiatives that you're looking at from your
community from your
experience or where we need to be moving
in of
14 towards here
in New Mexico because we heard from the
Spanish chamber
really specific Lee Alcon
policies involving tax
changes
navigating the red tape no such
things as like to get their perspectives
chair New Mexico
first.
Specifically the Asian business
community we actually are
register I want to do so we don't
lobby on purpose
anything The New Mexico Asian
families that will bring to our
table that prioritizes
the Asian communities is it
understood policy
that will will be behind
however I would say
that what we because right
advocacy organization
most of our work is always
after the law or after
the policy has been
implemented I just
and it goes back to what relief
had said being very
mindful of
business practices are
business policies that
hinder the
opportunities for
us to be successful
especially from the Asian
American lands
also specifically
with
language access we're very proud
of that bill being
passed
but I know that
was very small
at the time
but that made major
waves for the Asian community
because now
I can't tell you how many
times that language
access policy
has actually helped more
businesses be successful
so from the API communities
perspective language access
immigrant relations
those are really important
on the federal level level
our communities actually very closely
tied to the president here in New
Mexico because
of the at W.
adviser to
Asian American affairs in the W.
adviser to the president
is a of has ties to
New Mexico and some of
her federal policy
challenges that
some of you may see
is the definition of a hate
crime is actually
very impactful for
us if a business
we we seen for example
businesses that are specifically
targeted in one strip
mall and the only ones that have their
windows broken are actually Asian
owned businesses
APD is actually great
communication with us especially if
there after the Asian murders
and so their issue was
the fact that
the a lot of business Asian owned
businesses are keeping cash very
heavy in
so.
What we were that on the national
level is we could still
prosecute
those particular crimes
the hate crime it
it coincidentally
had Asian Americans
be the target but they
can't prove
it the burden of proof
wasn't there
this. As
as areas that makes these
like feel
however.
If you have influence on the federal
level policies
that's the biggest
problem that we run into the
API in each
community I
see if I was to
to madam chair
Representative Lujan
was really critical for us is actually
just more meaningful
connections
meaningful connections into your
communities that
have a police departments
law enforcement
counties that have
environmental health
economic don't we have a very strong
relationship with Santa Fe economic
development
we with that that's what
we need the most obviously funding
but the resources are actually
more what we need more so than the policy
but I can't speak for the the rest of the
team
so.
Thank you I would to save
it
my counterpart talked about
masses hierarchy of needs
I think
that we have to sort of get
back to the basic
needs
of housing in digital
inclusion those
are 2 of our major
priorities and I think
that of New Mexico
back leadership council you're just able
to purchase a building
being able to have a place
based strategy is really
important and a lot
of our business owners need
access to capital to be able
to
purchased their properties
and have
some timing
and then digital
inclusion
the.
Is no longer a nice
to have access to the
internet it's a must
have both for individuals and
businesses and digital
inclusion includes not
only access
to the internet but the savvy
to use it and one of the things
that we find and maybe
one of the reasons why you can't find
as many black owned
businesses as you would like
is because of
that and that's an
area where I think
we can partner
and I know that the New Mexico back
chamber is doing
work in terms of
trying to find those businesses
having them understand access
to capital
Committee development finance
financial institutions that
help people
become credit
worthy and
qualify for loans
to be able to operate their businesses
some of the things that we're interested
in.
Madam chair members of the
committee.
Appreciate the question
Representative Lujan
so for the American in the
chamber of commerce
state policy is an
area that we're just
getting started in
exploring how state
policy can affect we
mostly rely
upon the
of policy analyst over
at the Indian Affairs Department
this new policy
is introduced and
how it's vetted and and sorted
out again we don't
have the capacity in the
chamber of it
would be great to have a policy
analyst or a policy
person on board
and just mention earlier as
well we we do
not lobby
as a 501 C.
6 we're
also limited in our
funding our access
to funding
so separate from the C.
3
you know which is more common
out there we
actually are
disqualified from some
funding our access
to funding that may be
available so
those are just some things that
I have learned over
the the past couple
years as
more funding opportunities
have have been made
available I think
the other thing around policy
is centered
a room on the.
Premise of of
equal access
so
just we
develop increase
capacity around
grants management
to be an
effective
candidate for for
funding opportunities
I think that
that's an area that
that maybe policy
can can lend itself
to.
Thank you madam chair I really do appreciate
that I'm writing these things down as
and I'm sure all those are paying attention
some of things that we we keep
hearing and I I it's just to
have the presence and
and you hear
representing
our diverse communities
I would like to get offline talks
more about what education
and training and you know
with it with
with some of the things that I mentioned I
just want to say that to
Mr are going
up to we're about that pick it
up there is
a I would like
to refer you
to the right we have somebody that
works for state government seems Patrick
Schaefer over DFA
he did a tribal nations in trade
a history and outlook for New
Mexico and it
is a C. C. L.
E..
Trying to get in it's a whole outlook
and on economic
development and and our
tribal nations here in New
Mexico.
Incredible incredibly done so I
just wanted to put that out there
today really can at
how we are moving ahead
and what we need to specially in our
tribal tribes and
nations please
those are the things that are that are going
on and I like to talk more offline
a lot of things thank you madam chair
create the time
thank you Representative Aaron's gonna
write that down and share that
with the committee
so I appreciate that
Representative Martinez than
Representative about coming out
and then representative
Armstrong.
Thank you madam chair
and I appreciate
the the information
that all of you again
it led me to
some
questions
each of
you.
We talked about
about issues with
funding for your
organization.
Where does the funding come
from.
Specifically
for
the Asian business
collaborative
it's
Inc individual
contributions
we have pursued multiple
different requests across the
community a
nationwide for
example
companies that
match are big
donors towards us
so for example a
PNM is a large
donors com
cast a Wells
Fargo
but then we also have the City
of Albuquerque as
a major in fact the
PP drive
that they did with
$1000000 worth of
PP and the distribution
was actually our seed
money
the the more broke
the news that ABC before I was
even ready for it
and I see that
now that granted
again we were born of the pandemic that
was our first funding source what has
happened is that
the criteria is a lot of our
local governments while we
appreciate you know when
economic development from Santa Fe
can give us a donation or
Los crucis might will
put us in the challenges that
now we're contractually obligated
for services like
language access like translation
support
like
contracts with like in Ernie's
K.
convention tourism
anything that we can do to find
to be that direct resource
for the city government they
just put this in the challenge because a
were all limited resources
and the and the
Fund and I see that
incredibly sarcastically
the fund of
contracts
sometimes actually prevents us
which is how we actually ran out of
funding
so that's part of the reason
why that's how we get
funded and
just general you know I
I I'm a business owner
7 funding the project
myself you know
so.
At the.
So as a 501 see
3 we
are
working very hard to
diversify our funding
matrix we
write grants and
to
private and
public
corporations philanthropy
organizations
we also have some government
contracts
and
we.
Have private donors and that
said another
area of development
for us to develop
our I've done a list so
that's primarily how we're
funded.
Madam chair representative
of Martinez thank you for the
question the
American Indian chamber of commerce's
is funded through our
membership
we we have work to
to keep our membership
fees the
same as they were before
COVID it has
been a challenge
quite frankly
and we've had
to resort to grant
opportunities so
the need initiative which I spoke
to in the presentation
was funded for
the most part through the
Kellogg
foundation
and in their
effort to also enhance
capacity
so for the after pic
of funders we're
looking at federal funding
opportunities
and we have not
dug into state funding
opportunities just
yet. I I
do madam chair and
the rest of the county Representative
Martinez you one thing you
didn't ask was how
could we gain additional more
funding down the road
so ABC's actually not a
membership organization agents
don't want to pay for help and I don't
blame them I don't want to either so
we're not actually structure like a
chamber which is the acting
central business
location so
sometimes and and I can't
begin for the rest the organization
sometimes you actually can go
out to a company
actually inform them of education
resources we can be a service
provider for them
ultimately to the City of Albuquerque
that's where we where we'd like to open
up opportunities economic
development where we
can be an extension
of their team or be an
extension of
any government
entity that's looking
for
ways to reach the Asian
community in some way shape or
that's actually how New Mexico Asian
families there's a lot of their work
so thank you for the
question.
Thank you for that
this question is more
for Chris still
and
Catherine.
What what is what
is the outreach
I know that it's easier to
do outreach for
your communities and urban
setting. A
lot of them are centered
in Albuquerque but
what about the rural
population what are
you doing to do outreach
to the rural population
it's a great question so
originally in
Albuquerque and partially
in Santa Fe we would do I
I will get to the real question how
you do that we have outreach
missions and what we
found specifically in the Asian
community you have to have
community navigators
that not only trust the
organization but also can
speak the language
of the organization
so for the rural
communities it's the
only way we have been
somewhat successful
is through a New
Mexico SBA
offices
community navigator
program or their small
rural I'm
directors that actually
do that type of direct work
we've worked even with the New Mexico
as state as society
because cessation executives
Essie and
it's a challenge
because
they're hiding right
the Asian communities not purposefully
I think that is very hard
to find and then
depending on what the intentions
are or the cultural competency
of what culture they might be coming
from they've you know
Vietnamese people might not trust
Filipino people or
Phil Chinese
folks depending on if they're
Cantonese or Mandarin
or if there even Taiwanese
or from Hong Kong you never know
what that political implications could
be so that it's a trusted
navigator system that is
how we're
working through also places
of worship have been really
helpful Kwame
and the
100 temples that are in the
international district
having conduits for us
especially for the rural
communities or not doing
enough to just sit simply
because
as it all starts from somewhere
and we're we're barely watering the seat
at this
point.
So for
you know trying to to build
infrastructure in
a community that has been
historically excluded
it requires building
as I've talked about before
communications network
infrastructure in a collective impact
organizing strategy
so being able to
figure out ways that people get
information finding out where
individuals are we
know that 60 percent
of the blacks in New Mexico
live in central New Mexico
and the others in the outlying
areas and so
we need to develop communication
strategies to be able
to get information
out to people one
of the things that I handed out to you
today is the up of
chronicles that we created
with New Mexico black leadership
council they goes out
in Albuquerque
and we
also for the printed copies
but we also have the ability
to distributed electronically
to let people know
what we're trying to do was created
at a dialogue as
opposed to a
monologue we're we're just
sending out information but we're
developing ways that people
can get back to us
with the information and then
fostering collaboration
among other
black led organizations
like the New Mexico black chamber
and the office
of African American affairs for the state
of New Mexico so it
is a work in
progress it's been a
long time coming but
there's no better time than
now.
Madam chair my last
questions for
Mavis.
I was very
impressed.
With the fact that you're
keen
on
establishing credit
worthiness.
When we started working
I used to work for department of Veterans
Services when we started our veteran
business opportunity
center. One
of the first questions
was can you help
me get capital.
But to educate that
prospective business owner
on what it
takes.
To get that capital
they would come in thinking
what you're just going to give it to
me.
That's not the way this
works.
So all I really
appreciate the fact that
that's one of the things that you're
keen on.
Because I think that
will go a long way
to making that small
business.
Survive.
Because when you're teaching
them this is
how you.
This is how you budget
this is needs
and wants
I think that's a key
element in making
a business survive that
not a lot of people
understand.
They have a passion for what they
do.
They have an idea of how
to market it
but they don't have an idea
of the budget
process.
And that's when
you see businesses.
Struggling because they're not
making payroll but
they're buying brand new
vehicles
or they're paying
exorbitant amounts in
advertising.
So I really appreciate
that my question
for you
is.
You talked about
about doing this in the
different in the
different
communities.
How important do you think it
is that.
Financial literacy be
taught in the
schools
before the that
way they have that skill before the
county.
Can you can you kind of talk
about how important that still
would be.
And getting them a little bit
ahead.
Thank you madam
chair and representative
Martinez thanks for the
question. In
our experience
of establishing
an understanding.
The a
relationship if you will
with money
is has been part of those
conversations
with the the participants
in the training and many
of them have expressed
they've had no conversations
relative to financial
management
so they
have responded
to your question and
saying financial
literacy is such a
core competency
it should be taught more
in our schools
and it's really
a life skill I mean
big picture
if I'm preparing myself
for my future and whatever
it is that I'm doing how
financially stable
am I just
stability.
Get a loan this ambition
to launch a business
or to use what
financial resources I have
available to me to
go and move
something progress
something move
toward life vision as a
as we say that in in the
training and so
it's it's it's essential
and the feedback that
we receive as part
of our evaluation
process in
these trainings
that's probably the number
one
takeaway
that participates
have identified
to be impacted.
We talked about money
today and we've
not talked about money
any other time
including
often in the
household.
Madam chair thank you very much for the
time. Thank you
Representative we've got
Representative Rebecca yet
next and then
Representative Armstrong and
Representative Montoya
I do want to be respectful and
and very appreciative of the
time we have kept you
over so
I would ask that the committee kind of keep
their questions to the to
the point and also we
will start back up again 130
so it's up to you
to decide how long you want your lunch break
to be so
I do but I do appreciate all of
your thoughtful answers and
so Representative
Roybal Caballero.
Thank you madam chair
and thank you
to the
panel as you
all have articulated
and as you
well aware the
populations of color
that you Representative
are actually the population
vast majority of
our populations in our state
so it's important that
you were here today and I think the
chairs for
having no invite
you I also
want to commend you on the fact
that you're modeling your
successes in
partnerships with each
other and in
collaboration which really
solidifies your
solidarity
which means that we have
unity and
progress and
because as we up lift
each one of our own
particular communities
through this modeling were
up lifting all
of our communities and that's
what we need in order
to on
overcome the
historical disparities
that have existed for our
community so you're
to be commended
I also want to
make sure that your commended
on the fact that
you're not only the face
of our stab wish businesses
that are emerging
businesses
and that's also
critical for our
successes and our communities
throughout and I do want
to mention just
because struggle is
here I had the
privilege of
being that development director
for state city cultural
center and economic business
development and
I worked in personally
experienced
how
not just this
model but all
of our indigenous
models in the
state center
workforce.
The center
workforce and everything that
they do I saw that process
first hand and by
centering the work force
and employees
it meant business
success because
that's how the businesses
succeeded and that's
really really
important
at least from my perspective
and my mindset and I think
that's why you're valued
throughout our state
empowering and
centering a healthy workforce
is actually empowering
the business and
building it and that's why
it has to be the
center of all
business development
and I won't recommend this to
everyone but if
I had a small business
I had a jewelry store
if you're gonna go on business and you
love jewelry don't do
jewelery because
you'll want to buy one or
2 for the business and 3
or 4 for you.
And that's what I did my
husband system meant to
trying to put controls on
that but anyway
having said all that it's
important for me to
understand
and kinda dispels some
notions that we've heard over the
past few years
on one we've attempted
as a state
legislature but also
as the state
in general to
improve the conditions
for
workforce.
And we've had a lot
of pushback.
And the notion
that if we are going
to provide
employees
with
thing such as living
wages such
as
leave policies
such as you know the list
can go on childcare
that it will lead to
the demise of Business
us I think
contrary obviously
and you are testament
today to the contrary
of that so I the
question I have for all of you
is in all
of your.
Business networks have you
phoned.
Any
or have you found that
providing
employees with
this with.
Health benefits living
wages leave
policies
transportation
assistance
childcare and other
type of
support.
In the workplace has
that been an
impediment
to thriving
businesses and business
growth.
I can.
Madam chair and
Representative not coming
here thank you so much for that
question I would say
that you know there's a reason why
dinosaurs are extinct
right if you don't
keep up with the times and
and do things
that need to be done
you're not going to be able to compete
in this workforce
especially for
black owned businesses of
the businesses of color
in order for us to be able to
compete for
staff and and talent
we have to be able to
provide benefits
and we need
to be looking towards
wait selfsufficiency
which in New Mexico the
department of labor says is
upwards of $28 an
hour so instead
of just looking at living
wage I think that we have to
be having our
goal is fire to be
providing people with weight
selfsufficiency.
Thank you madam chair Representative
career
so.
I'll speak from 2 lenses
so from the ABC
lands we actually represent the
employer not the
employee that
puts us in a position where
we can't say yes
or no for what
is the benefit for the employee
and ABC gets that
question a lot
right we don't
why haven't you raise supported
paid sick leave why haven't
you supported
healthy workplaces Act X.
cetera our goal is
actually to educate the
employers so they know
what's ahead
or what's to be
found down the road
but we have a
population
that needs to understand what it
is in the first place
meaning a lot of communities
especially in like for example take
the Philippines is a perfect example
the Philippines doesn't
have pay
roll in a way that
we do you have to be a
contractor for
12 months first
and if you're in a
payroll employee
what's your let go you have to
be paid mandatory 12
months'severance
if you're let go so the cultural
competencies of running
the business is we actually
have to educators or or basically
with some folks have said
ABC needs to teach some
of our Asian counterparts
are Asian
population how do you
business in America that's what we
focus on first.
However as a business
owner I've
consciously made the decision
to to add that but
I don't dictate what my
counterparts can do because
like Kathy said best
sizes are extinct for a
reason. It
created a competitive advantage
for my a public
relations advertising agency
being women of colour
Filipino or
Asian
or not or and an
Asian and
also offering paid
benefits sick leave Exeter
for and
our youngest team member for
a long time was 36
and to me
so it's it's a different
dynamic for a
business owners nowadays for in
terms of what their understanding
but I think that there I
think it's
becoming more
and more agencies is well
known to be one of the more progressive
in terms of our budget or
more
generous
and we've seen that young
people are looking for companies
like that if they decide not to go
solo
themselves.
Madam chair representative
arroba of Google
letter of thank you for the
question
so
the response that
we have as the chamber's
economic showing the value
of supports for workers
centers around the
really financial
situation condition
of even with the minimum
wage of $12 an
hour
right
annually it's just
shy of
$25000
per year.
And.
When we think about
rent
in some of our cities and
towns being a
one bedroom I think we did
a up in court here
recently I think this
anything from 1500 to
$1800 per
month well
that $25
$0
annually divided by 12
this little over $2000
per month
so.
Can a person survive you
know on even the minimum
salary
so the support
from businesses
in health
care you know
even vision
dental
B. A. P. programs
except for a I
think it's becoming
more of
a tractor to
workers when
businesses have that available
to them
and I think
it can put businesses in
a in a great position
to
expect
hi a top
performing
individuals in to
be part of their teams
because they're offering that so
finding that balance you
know as organizations
S. S. businesses
with this is what we're providing
in addition to compensation
or base compensation
as far as other supports
this is what we have available
to you even if it is
transportation you
know can or a voucher
for you know a bus
pass it could be
it could be maybe something
small but
to the employee it
could be the difference
of.
Working or not
and unfortunately some
people.
Run the numbers and it
doesn't make sense I should
work
because I would
arrive.
So
that some of the
observations were
at.
Okay if I may I'd like to go ahead thank
you we've got 6 I was
just gonna say thank you very
much for each of of
your responses state
actually
really address the
direction that we need to be going
into thank
you. Thank
you Representative Roybal
Caballero if I can ask for we
still that 6 people so we have Representative
Armstrong Representative
Montoya Representative
had at a Representative Representative
Matthews Representative
turned in and then Representative
guy goes we'll wrap it up
can all keep it please to one
question so
that we can move forward so representative
Armstrong you're next.
Thank you madam chair and thank you all for
your presentation I'm gonna
be quick and to the point I
I love
Mr ever gone this
analogy of we're all
brothers and sisters
and we're all people.
And so
knowing you know my husband
I started a business 35 years
ago. And
I now have over 1000
employees 11
businesses.
We did that on
nothing.
We did that with no help
and so the
fact
that
you know I just like the all
people part of
it all
people
I would encourage you all to be
in the high schools and middle
schools and
and and create a pipeline
to feed our businesses
and financial literacy
Representative Martinez took
that one but just
dental on that we need
that in our schools we cannot
get it passed in the
legislature
of.
Child care right now
the state is competing
with the private
industry.
We're putting private industry out of
business because we're allowing
the state to come in and just take
it over. Those are
businesses those are
women most of those businesses
are women of color
that we're putting out of business
so just keep that in mind
during the legislature
also when we create
mandates on
business.
That hinders businesses from
opening.
And and it does not help
when we.
As a free market in a free market
if we can offer.
Paid family medical leave if we
can offer our
New Mexico work and save if we
can offer different things to our
employees that is an
attraction for employees
when we mandated across for
all businesses it's not
an attraction for individual
employers.
Let us have it as an
attraction so that we
can compete and
not mandate that type of
thing the biggest thing
I just want to make asked
Mr added on a question
if you had been in touch with
the Alamo Navajo school
and if not I would love to
to help you get
there we
have some real issues up there I don't
represent them but they are my friends
and my neighbors.
And and my
family.
So I didn't really have a question
just have to say that thank you madam
chair thank you representative
Armstrong Representative
Montoya.
Thank you madam chair
I do have just a one quick
question is for Mr gone
and.
It.
Once in my my wife is
native American and
I have worked on the
Navajo reservation for most of
my life.
There's some real problems that
exist for native Americans that
I think are different
than a of all the other
presenters.
This morning and
that is.
Private property.
If you live on tribal
lands the the
tribal lands.
Are owned by the tribe
and.
When you're when you're trying to start a business
especially if you're looking for a
loan.
Access to
capital.
Obviously you mentioned credit
worthiness and
you briefly mention
assets.
But collateral
a lot of times is something that
is needed to start a
business.
Unless you're able to start
something literally out of
your garage
and the the the jobs that I've
seen madam
chair.
On the Navajo reservation
that have
opened a lot of more
garage type of
businesses you know somebody who
had a skill like being
a mechanic
and they were able to just open it right
there in their home and
but
how how
how.
Do tribal
communities.
What can they do
to try and
and
allow for more private
property.
I I've seen some free enterprise
zones and the Navajo
Nation
but this is a big
problem lenders
want to be able to lend money
but when they do
even on a home it's almost
impossible on tribal lands
to get a home built
because the home cannot
be repossessed by
the mortgage lender
so
how what are some of the
things that can be done on tribal
lands to help.
To be able to build collateral and
assets.
Thank you madam
chair Representative
Montoya for their for the
question it is
in the unique challenge for
sure and I appreciate
your
understanding and awareness of
that of when when
lands are held in
trust
certainly the federal
government you know has
involvement in that
and so that
distinction between lance
and trust versus
lands held in fee
simple of
status
I think it's one of the ways some
tribes are exploring
how to be able
to the canal
which
a lan assignee
versus land owner
of you know
to
establish their either home
or their business you know on those
lands so
I think the lending
community has become more
familiar or
become more
flexible
and we're
of those circumstances
and I think one
in a group that particularly
the CDFI
especially native CDFI
these have
become more aware
of the situation
and and you
know in light of
collateral
madam chair representative Montoya
some lenders will
lend based off
of the
purchase were
or or or
other forms of
collateral
that that might be
available to to
to folks but it's
still I think for I feel
and still roots back
to establishing
myself as credit
worthy.
If I'm going
to borrow
other people's money
at some point.
How am I a positioning
collateral of
for that and
how my fund raising tort
collateral
to be able to springboard
my business you know forward
so it's
methodologies I think like
that through training
and again preparing
business owners for that unique
circumstance
as well M.
the tribes I think our
our.
Open to exploring
ideas but again
it's still centers around
the land status
and again I I I can't
speak for any particular tribe
in particular
but I think
there direct knowledge of the
situation that you're you're
asking about.
Thank you venture thank
you Representative
Representative Matthews and Representative
Herndon vice chair Gallegos
is going to finish this off after you
to ask your questions I would
like this to be done by one
just out of respect because these folks have
been here for over 2.5
hours.
I used to work in public radio I'm always
about the time so just to give you
background data so
Representative Matthews you're next
thank you and thank you all for a
presentation on is
very interesting
and excellent
my question is
how could our
state agencies that focus
on business such as the department
of economic development
and organizations
like the bigger chambers in New
Mexico chamber of commerce the
Albuquerque chamber of
commerce course the
chambers in various cities
how could they be more
supportive and
helpful to
your communities and
what you're trying to
do.
Madam chair representative
Matthews knowing that
we're not competition
I think is the number one
piece and I say this
because sometimes
Ernie and I have white boarded
in his office and said how can
we work together the fact
that he opened his office and said we're
not in competition with you
we understand that you've got funding
here and crystal your team
has funding here we're not
in competition with the chose are
realizing that we can complement
each other actually
means more I used to
work for the Albuquerque chamber of commerce
and you know the dynamic is very
different at the
time so that's
it's our number one is is knowing that
we're not competition to
each other number
2.
I would say that the the
another way that they all
could work together is
efficiency
we're very think of it is this
way when a small business owner
decides the gonna contract
out work as a
vendor of the
know that it's going to get done because
they're paying for that service is not an
employee it's a
subcontractor we can guarantee that
it's gonna be that because that's our
specialty I think it
was in that fashion so the
departments like the state
various different state departments could
think of it that way right
they could think of us as an
extension to better
serve the state of New
Mexico
because the state of New Mexico
has a 5 percent population of
Asian Americans Asian
impregnated Moines Pacific
Islander
so.
Working with us
as an extension of the department
would be the best way for them to work with
us.
Madam chair representative Matthews
that thank you for the question I think that
M. I'll echo
collaboration versus competition
is very important
also that
those state
agencies
often have
need
support in terms of
education and outreach there
many great programs
and you know people
are challenged to find out about them
they need to partner with us
to get the word out
in our
communities.
Yes madam chair
Representative Matthews thank you for
the question
so
for the American Indian chamber
of commerce of our
obligation of course is to
our membership so
we we center to that
constituency but
we also acknowledge the 23
tribes nations and Publicis
part of that focus constituency
so so we work to support
that and
in conversations
with the the nature of
commerce for example
how can we collaborate with
you to support your
a constituency more
effectively with our programs
and outreach and in this
time and date of
of virtual meetings
and and training we're able
to reach a wider audience
but but specifically to
your question I I
think the.
The strategies that are
being developed that at the
state level
we have many economic
development strategies
or economic recovery
strategies
of the economic
development department has
one tourism
has one
the the company
levels they have won the
city has one
and how
are the all of
line
this part of the
question
are we
strategizing in
silos or are
we going different directions
and then comes the question
how are
our businesses that we
represent part of
those strategies
engaged in involved in
setting those strategies
and prioritizing what the
goals and ambitions and obviously
if the funding so long to the goals
that you know we all
benefit in that
collaboration so really
looking I guess at the process
and methodologies
around setting strategy
and funding strategy
and involving our
populations in that
I think would be
tremendously helpful
we we have reached out
as the chamber to the City of
Albuquerque so
for us it's engaging
the different areas of
government the federal
government the state government
and and the
local government
inclusive of the tribal
government so
in our chamber we do have
the tribal government
membership
level and the
many of the tribes are
involved in that way and supportive
of our efforts in that way as
well.
Thank you thank you that's my
on question thank you
Representative and I remember even
prior to me becoming a Senator
one of the biggest frustrations was
having local and state
governments
going and replicating what we already
have the capacity to do as the
chamber of commerce and
it's really the important
thing is is to support those
agencies that are already on the
ground boots on the ground to already
invested in communities
to support them in doing that instead
of trying to route to reinvent the
wheel so and
am grateful for that question and
and your responses
Representative turned in and then
vice chair guy goes we'll finish this
up thank you madam
chair my My one
question focuses around
something that was a theme
by all 4 of you when
you began is that that had
not been the convening of all
of the small businesses
to talk about your needs
so my question is
have you asked a state
agency to can make that
convening and if you
haven't this is the budget
here so this would be the time
for you to make that request
so I just present that to you
and as you do that I just want
you to remember that with
respect to this paid family
leave that.
Small businesses always than what
we can't do that because we're small
business C. N. emit
is putting together groups
of people who have who
have retired and they would be
able to step in
to help those small
businesses when your
employees have to leave
on on paid family leave
and it wouldn't cost you any
additional money and also
just wanted to add to say one
last thing with with specter
that as you answer my first
and one of the only question
is that with respect to these
internships that we
talked about we heard
about there being deficits
in places like inspectors
but why aren't we focusing
O. R. is that way for you to focus
on making those
I'm out but
looks like ideal
internship that nobody ever
thinks about Michael I'm going to be
an inspector and
intern so you could do
that so that we could grow our
own in those areas where we have
deficits so first
of all have you asked
for a bit a state
agency to convene
all of the small businesses
and if so and if not
who would you like to have convene
that and will you make that
**** this
year.
I'll go first and
madam chair
Representative Matthews and
and 0 I'm sorry yes
we will do that
and it is just a matter of
people getting together to talk about
it we're doing that now and so
I think that momentum is been
developed.
I'll quickly answer the question
to madam chair and
representative her date of if
you're in corporate America
right now we're having larger conversations
about economic
social
social worker at
employees groups as well
as diversity equity inclusion
strategies.
I might be wrong it's really
difficult for us to have a larger
conversation with neck New Mexico
economic development is New
Mexico economic development
doesn't prioritize
D. as part of economic
development. I
don't feel welcome at the table I could
be at least at
as a secretary Keyes was
incredible and
welcoming but it didn't seem
like it was a priority so it's it's
difficult to open that
door if they're not publicly
addressing that is a
priority.
I will madam
chair and Representative
Lujan and thank you for the question
I I all echo in
the sense of
it including
inclusion and
and how we convene a
small businesses
as the breaking in the chamber
of commerce we have an annual
summit
and
we look for speakers at
all different areas federal
government state government
so it in
involvement in in
those summits
with.
Engaging
meaningful of
participation
of sharing
opportunities
sharing success stories
of I think could go a
long way in in other
in being aware of other types
of supports that are
available to
employers as well as
employees
in in seeking
services you know from the
state I think to
the the
interest with
internships and
developing
meaningful
internship
opportunities
by design
and we look
to
of future focused education
for example is one of the
entities we we become
aware of in their
service model in
helping businesses
design internship
programs so
the it's not such a burden
on the business
to to institute
internship program and
then funding that you know
of so the business
benefits by having
an individual who's learned
in different areas of
business but engaged
and motivated to be there
and being compensated
by an entity outside
of the business I think
it is another so
designing more of those kinds
of opportunities I think
will go a long
way.
Thank you so much and vice chair Vegas
officials off.
And thank you I want
to really thank all of
you for being here today
you know I started having to go
make presentations
20 years ago chamber of
commerce's and I
would show up as a woman and
as a brown woman and I would
just feel out of place
and so by
your words today some of the things
that you talk about use the
word journey use the we're
telling our story
I think those are very impactful
for people like me
people of color people
who are not used to
walking into that
room you talked about not
feeling welcome not
feeling not
being invited to the table so
I think what you are
doing is bringing people
to the table to hear the
stories to understand
that there's a different plate
that maybe
mainstream doesn't always
recognize and here
and so I think your voices
today are so very
important
you talked about
grants and for in
my role I work with grants
and is understanding the
language to be able to talk
about to be able to get the
grant and to be able to
talk about
how to help what you did
with that money for the grant
and so just being able to teach
people that process
and I that's what I'm hearing that you
all are doing you talk about navigators
you talked about
different things that you are
doing being the
experts
cultural experts
and I think that that's a
piece that New
Mexico should really be
uplifting and talking about
because that's what this
what are what our
state is about is different
cultures and for
so long maybe we
didn't always recognize
and
acknowledge
those cultures but I think
that not only can
we see how
it benefits us in
in just so many
ways but even
financially we were
able to to tap in on some
of that people want to come to New
Mexico I've been I was
sitting in an airport not too long ago
and it's like come to you know
it's our big
true of
marketing and it's.
It to its has the restrictions
and the Chiles and you know you
hear people around they're going to cut it
looks beautiful and
distributing gauge our
culture and to show off our
culture right and
so I want to make sure that
that I think you I and I want
to express gratitude
and hommage for you
all being here because
I think together our
voices are stronger
and you all have definitely
made sure that those are voices are
heard today and so thank you for
doing that in your
respective cultures
and bring that to us today so thank
you.
Thank you madam vice chair I appreciated
you know this is a final final
note you know
we all items are used to
make me a respond or
just comment briefly 2
yes I fully please madam chair
thank you and
vice chair of the
the eagles thank you for for the
observations of the
committee
just even your reflection is
beneficial to me and I
supposed to us
in that you acknowledge
in your hearing and understanding
the perspective that we're coming
from in front of this
committee and we again
appreciate the invitation
as we look
to involve
ourselves at least
the for our
constituents in in
mainstream
society
how we fill our place how
we demonstrate our talents
it could be something
like just
maybe simple as
we have some businesses looking
for forcing stirs
and seamstresses right
now you know I
I I've got these orders
to fill these
gallons and these
these you know a
native inspired
dresses and a
tire but I need
sewers I I need
and and they may not be technical
workers but there
are folks who are out there with
that interest
and and that's especially
the who we're working
to support are
those individuals
so as we work to
engage the small business
development centers
and the state economic
development department
we're encouraging let's not
forget about those
industries as
simple as they may
be but to
acknowledge their part of our
rural economy as well
thank you.
Thank you so much and
of you know there been so many points
I always think that whenever we're
looking at an issue or
concern in our state we look at
it is like the wheel of a
bicycle that their
spokes off of that we'll
in there many things and that's through
this conversation today
when we talk about economic development
we talk about small businesses we
realize there are a lot of
spokes to that
issue and
you know we we need to uplift
and respect and
and and
hold close those folks
who are representing those different
spokes of that issue
so I'm grateful for your
time and your willingness
and obviously this committee was very
excited about this panel in this
discussion and
so I'm grateful for
your time committee thank
you so much for your insight and
insightful and thoughtful
questions
if you have other questions
that come to you in the middle of the night
which I'm sure they will
you can email
and don't call her in the middle of the
night that you can email
Erin and she will
respond and connect you with
our panelists today
and so thank you
all for being here
lunch is it across the
hall in room
106
we will reconvene
for lunch
I'm gonna give it a little push
about 13135
but will come back at around that
time if you will thank you again panel
for being here we're gonna go ahead
and recess for about 30 minutes.
