Representative ring
representative zamora.
Madame vice chair
madame chair.
Military code I was at close
sponsor on the original sj are
one which is why i'm sitting
here today it doesn't show as my
cosponsorship doesn't show any
longer because.
So you know how that
that plays out but we have heard
about this particular
colundrum in the court's
corrections in justice interim
committee numerous times what
has happened as we have a really
I think effective system.
I've judicial selection with
the.
Appointment of a judicial
selection committee for every
single judge ship at a certain
level not.
And
I have with me this morning
professor indeed canal carry of
the UNM school lot and she's not
the first day to have
had to deal with other
constitutional limit that
created the judicial selection
commission because it required
that the deal chair the
commission what happens is the
deal spends all of the dances
time doing that because there
are so many and I I witnesses
when I was in law school and I
actually was appointed by
speaker lohan
to one of the commissions and my
dinner the time swell in the
scardinakia.
Who's now the dinner at the
university of michigan
was let me know how much time it
was taking for her to do this
and so this is not with your um
what you see before you now is a
very simple amount of the
constitution which is on page
two lines for through seven it's
the last the mexican school of
law the dean of the university
in mexico school of or the dense
design and then there's some
specifics about whose
eligible and associated backlay
member retired faculty member or
former dean and or the dean of
the day in this design so that's
what.
Because I probably didn't
give enough about the pain that
you did a wonderful job madam
chair representatives.
On behalf of the union.
As representative chase you
mention it is a w.
The.
But it i.
When I have spoken with the
folks who have been and who were
involved in the initial am.
They have said that it was a big
oversight to not provide for a
designing so if I am sir or we
have a crisis at the last score
or we have some important
initiative that we.
And in fact the number of
commissions has wrong.
Originally put in the country.
I have one here.
And in the following few weeks
after that we will be in grants
so we have a lot of concerns at
the law school a.
So I really.
For helping me.
Of new mexico.
We're expecting an enrollment.
So it would be very helpful to
have a design.
And for questions.
Thank you madam churn thank you
presenters for bringing this
for.
Give you less than.
An infact.
So the function of the chair.
That the commissions are equal.
So then.
Will these.
Well all that information.
Or will you be completely out of
it I will still be very madam
chair representative I will s.
My.
So I will still be in char.
The manager unless anyone else
had anything I just was gonna
move a.
Thank you
so much thank you madame.
The.
Thank you senate bill one twenty
six deals with the per deal
rates that we all get and as I
was looking into some of this it
there are multiple places that
perdiums is set some of it is
set by following the I r s
requirements but there also is
some instant law that is not
been updated since two thousand
and four and thus does not match
with inflation and the other
predium rates of that sort what
this bill does is it moves all
of it to the night believe it's
called the gas
system and so yes a system so
that all of the predium
escalates whenever that changes
that the federal rate whether
you're going to meetings by car
by airplane by motorcycle
the people doing it and filling
out our forms don't have to look
multiple places and it's
consistent across the board
that.
And I got through two committees
in five minutes totally
while I appreciate.
If you've been in senator we run
things pretty on time.
When we need to ride.

twenty nineteen task force and

support this memorial because
it's important to have the
appropriate data to begin to

problem if we don't fully

futures and we support this we
