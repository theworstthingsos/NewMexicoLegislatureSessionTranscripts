lente had just started at the

Thank you madame chair
this isn't being the best
committee to be
you don't get praised like that
I am anthony alice I represent
district for which is in the
northwest corner of new mexico
a majority of my constituents
are from the navigal nation
I also grew up.
I went to school in gallop where
we had to write the bus thirty
three miles one way and we had
to leave real early in the
morning for the suncorner so we
could make it school and then we
came home.
But even then we didn't have
time for homework we had your
home tours first with the
homework and we did not have
electricity or running water
mother and for the were situated
so we had to do our homework by
land.
Not even the curse and it was
the the old type where it.
In my district we have the same
one river that runs through our
my text and a lot of my
constituents are farmers and
ranchers so I thought it would
be a good fit for me to serve on
the water committee and I have
enjoyed every second of it I
have learned so much from all
the members here I think my
first.
She shares and which would mean
my first year's
shared so much.
And in our culture we value
everything
when we used to go on on travel
after.
Younger man late teens I used to
travel.
River my mother and father would
stop make a start and we would
make a sacrifice to the running
water because we we still
believe that it is a living.
Through the creator.
Or fruits or anything that are
lives depended on and to this
day
seventy four years later I still
practi.
When I cross the river I make a
second.
So
when we say who order his life
and the indigenous they say it
true.
Serving as your bicycle thank
you I think the committee for
making me a part of the team
thank you
that's thank you in my need of.
Yeah.
Not as large as this district of
representative of armstrong but
it's about the size of
massachusetts I cover most of.
Two and a half hours over.

It takes a lot.

friend through my district.

I always do.
It really doesn't matter.
We want to.
Mine of defense.
We don't think the language is
quite right.
The.
That's that's what we care about
how do we help members get their
ideas fashioned in a way that
will have a posit.
So that's how I I see our rule
as.
Will operate under the.
That means if you have a if you
have an amendment that really
kind of.
Somebody got a word wrong or
this misspelling we can take
care of that.
Yeah.
That will only happen for the
first two and a half weeks when
we get to about a week and a
half out and you know how it
gets around here in a thirty day
session things applying our job
is to help these bills from the
s.
And and I have seen members on
this committee all of us go
over.
And we support each other when
we get good legislation.
Limits.
I think that's fair to everybody

lot.

incidents as sixty five
qualified projects.
And I will deferts my expert
witness to introduce herself and
to
be able.
Good morning madam chair thank
you very much for hearing the
spill this morning and thank you
to the sponsors I would not that
this is an annual authorization
bill the water project fund
which the finance authority has
been overseeing since two
thousand and one requires that
the project's first received
legislative authorization before
we can make a grant we're alone
so this process is necessary in
order for us to actually
distribute the funds that have
been made available to the water
project fund the water project
fund receives two sources of
funding one is from the
severance tax bond.
When we started the application
process in august we expected to
have about.
That money.
Projections have changed and so
we now expected the about
fifteen million d.
The projects.
At two hundred and seventy five
m.
Part of which has happened
because there's been over the
last several years a larger
amount of money made available
and that's garnered so.
That are represented here are
for me n.
So a much larger percentage of
these projects.
Seeing projects from.
Trustport is the.
The.
Yeah.
I should go to the audience for
so do we have.
Good morning that in chair of
the next ball not though the
registered lobbies from the
mexico gas association we
support this bill because it
allowed communities but keeping
up today increasing necessary
water structure projects.
Like water conservation
prevention water storage and.
Anybody else.
I'm here support of this bill
obviously
are our community community
suffers greatly
water out of community
water water recent twenty twenty
two three hundred and eighty and
twenty twenty three we've had
cruise working day night nothing
but it's.
We appreciate the mother for
road project that major but we
can't six road you can't go
underneath the picture whatever

lobby new mexico association so
water contribution districts and
just
things that were charged.
Thank you madame chairman
members of the community.
For what you're doing
can you tuck a little bit about
I believe there was ten that
they.
Either g.
Grant.
Can you talk a little bit about
that what what where they
applied and didn't qualify or
what what reasons do we see for
that.
The manager the projects before
they.
They look at every applica.
As well as.
Projects to.
To.
So there's only two hour.
That are not represented.
Larger than the expected.
If they're ununable to meet the

get bypassed in.
The me.

It's a sixty five qualified
projects.
So some of the p.
Thank you for that answer in i'm
so sorry I just wanted also.
In this eighty three percent
were granted and only seventeen
percent were alone after after
the the project said.
Thank you.
I know
i'm i'll change m.
Misit represent.
Where does.
But where does that money come
from.
And that's very important matter
material does come from.
The drilling we are sitting
number two in the nation as far
as oil exploration.
What.
Drinking.
All sorts of water projects.
Have to keep that money that it
does come from oil and guess
revenues
madame chair and representative
gates I have carried this bill
before.
I understand.
Madame chair percentage cater
miss rus.
What is the procedure that an
interest he has to make.
August we asked for letters of
interest.
To the water trustport that
letter of interest grants them
access to the app online
application system they need to
have.
That an online application that
application is reviewed.
Given the opportunity to make.
Yeah.
That project is the list is then
pr.
The recommendation from that.
Projects.
The rise if they're authorized
it goes back to that project
management team there we.
Or in their readiness submitted
their audits whether they've got
their zoning done whether
they've got their of water
rights in order and our
compliant.
In the order w.
Then recommend it.
Thank you very much for that
response it was very.
And madame chair miss russell
you you can also offer
assistance to the sm.
Madame share the.
Uhm critical data.
Documents that they can use to
apply here and other places and
madame chair and miss russell
where can they go to get help
with getting these cramps in.
Madam chair I wouldn't be asking
this que.
So one of the question that i'm
you mentioned.
That you could help in the
purchase.
Sure we look to see the.
Under project that they.
If there is an entity and need.
Madame chier miss russell have
representative gates against.
So with the
price that's out there it it is
difficult for these small teams
to do you said that there is two
days of hearing
so you had sick of fifty five
fifty seven actual entities that
were interested in.
There's a service.
This is all done electronically
is that.
We're both done in person.
So are they allowed to
certainly.
That's a lot of pro.
Yeah.
Sure that there's a little bit
of
glad it's over with madame chair
I do support this but there was.
Now and I would.
For m.
Thank the member.
Um.
And and no but.
Updated on.
And I want to.
Exactly what you're doing.
Representative.
Representative ca.
Yeah.
Yes.
Thank you madame chair and
representative for that and we
have seen
where things align well
where I used to farm in in
current county and in so called
torrents counties to are used to
rent
when the things align
nature has a way of doing that
doing that and in keeping those
eggs where they won't.
I hope it doesn't happen again
for you if it if it does happen
this will help the ranchers in a
i'm in support of that part i'm
sorry made the mistake again
madame chair that I thought it
was just for one part of the
state thank you manager that
concludes my c.
Thank you madame chair.
Confirm and clarify that an mda
is in fact in support of this
project and how those
collaborations are expected to
run.
Madam chair representative
are you talking about the
department of agriculture
yes.
Yes
permanent of agriculture is in
favor of this in fact prior to
working in here we did visit
with the secretary of
and they they are on board
thank you madam chair.
Thank you very much.
And.
But it wouldn't just.
From one extra.
Also be used for a devastating
the dep.
Get a part on conditions madam
chair representative it does
talk about pest mitigation so
the language is pretty open.
A certain focus area but it it
is brought enough for I think it
would have like.
Yes I I just wanted to follow up
that
we put past mitigation because
in our area i'm getting an echo
you got tried that
in our area it wasn't listed
beaters but this past summer we
had range lamb caterpillars.
I'm seeing the any unexpenditure
and inc.
Madame chair representative not
really but you know how it is to
pass these types of bill.
And we just want to get this
program started to see if the if
it's successful and if it is a
we'd like to expand it later
and madame chair and
representative I must all
looking at
it the analysis that was resumed
by doctor jeff witty with the
india
and then his
analysis on page two of the
the one to the three four
the fifth paragraph from the
bottom
it said that timing issues
previously usda.
I thought in him da was going to
be a chart to.
What what we were referring to
them that issue when we did go
to the control project this
summer the neighbor had not been
in place and so whenever I
started to work with the federal
delegation to s.
Sometime extended period of time
so that's why we mention that so
if if it does come to a case
where that is the police that
these land owners could still
potentially do a project that
control project and still get
some comp.
Okay and madame cheer and
representative.
Oh.
If it's three.
Set up organization.
I did get three different
companies one from colorado when
the.
The twelve this area was.
And obviously within a mexico
comp.
Competing with those area
applicators that are receiving
in the fire project area at the
burns car areas so it is limited
like you mention but they they
have been pretty.
Aware of that it's a short.
And madam chair that was a great
leader to my next question
whenever there is a problem if
this nature we have seen total
pastures wiped out because of
the.
So whenever we experience a
certain
infant.
Are you starting out at the
county level or the go straight.
And how fast is this response
because you write there is not a
very large window we have to.
For my experience to summarise
my first pro.
A county level.
Representatives from the new
explicit date land office we
invite it
and
we did invite representative
from the gr.
To attend the meeting to see
what we all needed to do to
accomplish this week.
Okay it mattered cheered that's
another good lead into my very
last question whenever you're
talking about this this outbreak
happened on approximately twenty
five thousand acres of new
mexico's state federal.
Did the state land office offer
any assistance and did the
federal to offer any assistance
no man
that's all.
My question is whether.
Long term approach to it.
Another kind.
Start to see how this program
goes and I if it's a.
Economy so.
In order to restore the balance.
Yeah.
But I know that there's been.
So so the goal ultimately is
tonight
this is our last resort whenever
it gets over threshold on the
usda has a spotters how many
dress up per square foot
she trigger that it is an
infestition the grass upper
population reoccurs annually and
we tried to live alongside with
them it's just when they get to
a point that it so much we're
trying to protect soil health
range land health cattle health
and an ultimately for.
Yeah.
I'm if we had not done a control
project this summer on my did
calculate the numbers of
eighteen hundred cows would have
had to have been removed and
similar number
and it would have been a
reduction of about three million
dolla.
Something like this but in uh
finalized my response we tried
to have long term effects as far
as a rotational grazing grades
in management plans in place to
wear we can live with the grass
uppers and that they can be
coincidental equal system that
we manage wildlife.
And thank you represent and
present her i.
Let's go here I I absolutely
support this bill and
understand.
And I have the utmost trust in
our state university that the
country really looks too.
And you don't reducing the
environmental impact.
Because they understand that's
that's their land.
But can you explain
what are the appr.
Of.
We know the impact.
Yeah.
For example this project that we
did this summer the the label
recommended a gallon parent or
we used.
Made sure that we were
after we did our first three
what it was it was in implied
that it was going to in impact
the fly population and mosquito
population are all of that kind
of stuff that when they straight
around at five thirty in the
morning I came out of five forty
and the mosquitoes were back in
full floors the flies were four
fours and we even monitored on
the cattle to see if it was
going to remove some of the you
know the bugs that are on the
cattle and we didn't get any of
those the cattle had the normal
numbers so we tried to be as
responsible as we can I can't
speak to what chemical.
They're continually changing
with
the companies and.
Takes place on that level as far
as trade names and active
ingredients or when that does
comma I mean we will be
responsible
as far as picking the one that
has the.
It's going to be applied
I think you share and and thank
you very much I I know that was
maybe an.
When you say we will be making
the dis.
No matter.
I don't really have anything to
do with the making decisions of
that that will be between the
land owner and the entities
involved including the new
mexico state land office and.
Thank you very much.
We have a second.
Representative.
Representative because.
Representative.
Representative is on
represe.
Representative matthews.
Yeah.
Mister

playing back and forth with.
Representative

these comfort in that put your
bill.
Thank you matter
i'm here today to present
house bill one thirty
n n
it's an impropriation relating
to the environment creating a
cloud seating weather
modification
project in the new mexico
department of agriculture
requiring reporting and making a
an appropriation I have with
returning mark as a my expert
witness and and we have an
expert witnesses that on zoom so
I don't know.
George bomar.
Chair I know pretty much nothing
about cloud cd but when these
guys came to me and ask if I
would be interested in carrying
a bill that would.
Less debit gone to the east
coast will I said I was ali and
I think we need more water and
we so we got together somebody
that does know about crowd
clouds eating and.
On zoom uh the
rather works on water.
The.
I think we have a month if you
want him to test make
presentation back.
Able to speak mister bromark and
you can you be hurt
and they need to yes can you
hear me
we needed a little louder
yes me a madam chair money in
his george bombard i'm happy to

work.
Can you talk a little bit later
maybe it'll help
yes my name is george bomar can
you hear me all right
yeah I think that's okay keep
speaking louder.
Go ahead mister belmark
yes madam chair representatives
i'm happy to be with you today
i'm calling you from austin I am
the texas state meteorologist
but retired recently
i've been involved in helping
the texas legislature establish
a rain enhancement program some
twenty five years ago
and that legislature put in
about fifteen million dollars
over eight years matching money
that was raised by local water
conservation districts to
essentially cover about a third
of the land area of texas with
cloud seating activities and
we've been doing cloud seating
now for over twenty five years
in much of west southwest in
south texas and i've been
fortunate to work with the rise
of outsoul and what are
conservation district in the
last few years now there's been
a limited amount of seating down
along the
texas border in eastern new
mexico
and it's very obvious that
during the summer time you have
a lot of thunderstorms that are
any patient is rain producers
and they would be very aminible
to seeding using aircraft
dispersing a material such as
silver eye died
we've seen very
compelling results from the work
that we've done in texas and the
climate of eastern new mexico is
quite similar to that of west
texas.
Do you want to introduce.
I'm sure I have with me charlie
marcus and he's been involved
with this for question.
Madame chairman members of the
committee
we have been working on this
cloud center they should for
about the last five years and
there's been.
Mr
media ar.
Actually what happens in the
cloud they use planes.
Efficacy we alr.
So that.
Or display that africa see in
new mexico.
We've asked for engag.
In close to mexico.
Conclusions was regards.
Record of.
And.
With.
There.
Thank you madame chair medicare
I think anything that keeps
water in new mexico is a is a
good thing
i've been working at it most of
my life strategy so I had to
keep it from run down health and
leave our state in if we.
Jim berlier was in new mexico
so.
Work business rosaville.
Yeah.
These clouds.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh we need to h.
You need clouds in the order to
see them.
Soil.
Yeah.
The.
I don't live in this.
Plants.
It's completely different.
About three hours later with the
cloud creation the cloud
creation.
A lot.
And this.
Thank you thank you very much
yes two minutes is up thank you.
Marine b eight
members of the committee my name
is learning vegas I don't
represent an organization but
i'm here to speak on behalf of
the animals in the plants and
the working class who was not
able to follow along with these
meetings because we are show the
same sky
and for a long time
the men talking about whether
modification was considered a
conspiracy will now it's out in
the open and now it's no longer
conspiracy now it's to save the
planet and some mitigate climate
change well i'm no scientists
but my concerns are what are the
elements that are used to see
the clouds
and how does it affect people
and what i'll be long term
effects.
And
I I would really like to know
what would happen if we stop
spring this guy because just
because this is a new proposed
bill doesn't mean that it hasn't
been occurring because our
industrial military complex has
been doing this for a very long
time and also private companies
that we don't know
so I
I do not consent to this and I
think we we should all learn
a lot more about what's going on
here.
So thank you for your time.
Camilla romero
good morning madam chair
committee members can learn with
the new mexico state land office
the land office stands and
supported this bill thank you.
The.
Jennifer rubbins
good morning madam chair members
of the committee i'm speaking to
you today as a long time new
mexico resident of over eighteen
years and a college educator I
was actually a first looking
this morning about increased
wages for part timers and found
out that this bill was on the
table so I don't want to be
redundant and I want to respect
your time but i'm highly
concerned about whether
modification programs being
deployed like what are proposed
with this bill one thirty in a
case you're not aware in organic
compounds like silver eye died
are actually used to cause this
artificial participant
precipitation into the
environment we have no doubt a
long term of what that does and
that's to humans as well what
concerned me when I started to
look over this are on your
website is that it says that it
would be considered part of the
natural water source and this is
being made by artificial means
would the public be told that
these methods are in place and
that they are actually modifying
climatic patterns to me this is
very concerning and once you
release this into the atmosphere
there's no way to control it so
there has been devastating
flooding and other parts of the
world that have used these types
of systems so I really do oppose
this bill and I ask that you
really take time to consider
what this would mean thank you.
I think you chair and thank you
for your presentation I
can see the.
Um I I will i've just been
doing.
Stay that one of the things i'm
finding is like wyomings been
doing this for ten years.
Percent.
And and it does.
Yeah.
If it the cloud seeming is a.
So that is where.
A no where here says.
Manager i'd like to ref.
Oh yes madam chair george
bombard again.
It is true that you need clouds
in order to be successful
exceeding and you need clouds
that have sufficient debt to
them namely young thunderstorms
in order to treat them
I have a very detailed
comprehensive technical study
that i'm happy to provide the
committee it's entitled g o
chemistry and impacts of silver
eye died use in cloud seating
and if I may just read one
sentence from this
report that was deserved
published in twenty eleven.
A based upon a fifty year period
of cloud seating in california.
And the study says comprehensive
studies and data reviews of the
environmental effect of the use
of silver eye died for cloud
seating all concur that there is
no evidence for adverse effects
to human health are the
environment from the use of
subaru I died for cloud seating
and i'm happy to provide this
report to the committee and
anyone else that would like to
take a look at it so thank you
very much this is representative
caters again and and i'd have
found some more
information on my google search
as well but i'm going to go back
to really.
Which is that the success
fifteen percent which is you
know any person is a success in
new mexico we need the water
um is that this is a cream over
mountain ranges.
That's what I am not hearing
what the processes and that
creating that snow pack is
really why we.
Positive.
Who is maki.
Representative
representative t.
Over the mountain in the winter
it is and that's the best close
scene that we can do because
what it does is it creates a
game we don't create a cloud a
crowd clo.
And it has to have a storm with
we then seed that cloud and we
can do that in the winter
especially because it creates
the snowball which then creates
the run off and that then also
recharges the op.
During the summer it can be done
over open.
The media all.
The.
Were deceived at so they can get
it to rain where.
Thank you very much
and an and I would just
respectfully ask a manager in
committee is that I would if if
we.
I would like them.
I wish something like that I
always want an audit.
Actually if you're going to ever
admin the spill please put that
in this bill but otherwise they
just respectfully ask the chair
to keep in mind.
I think you representative.
Those go through AP.
But we support the process of
deciding.
This.
Go through that like.
I think the interest and support
for those bills for us to gather
some more data to exactly your
point to understand better.
So hopefully that's how boring.
The.
Thank you madame here
to refer my question to the.
In there it says why is this
pilot project necessary there.
In new mexico and much study has
already been complete.
What new informatio.
Manager.
I don't know of any activity
regarding clouds in new mexico
other than what's been done
through this effort we have only
conducted.
Because of the rest that limited
funding that we had and so there
is not
adequate data
that I know
in ido.
This is the first to try to get
it going.
Push back that we have from
individuals that perceive that
there's a an unnegative impact
we've limited the license and it
it literally outlines the
geographic area that can be
covered and it's not quite all
the way to the north.
From.
And so it's really the dry as
part of the state so we want.
So I I don't know.
If you think through that
mentioner
now I wished you here with you a
note that I got from my
constituent special
okay they stayed with strongly
opposed to cloudsetting pilot
project and the use of taxpayer
funds for such a venture the
substance utilised for a cloud
seating legs the overall day
those significant threats to a
quarter life.
As has the substances under the
clean water acc allocate nearly
two million dollars towards a
program that could potentially
contaminate our ground water and
land is deeply concerning.
Uh several.
So many chair like my expert on
zoom just.
Yes madam chair representatives
this is george bombard
the other had been the extensive
studies done where silver eye
died is used as a seating agent
california australia
in other western states
this report that I cited just a
moment ago is the most recent
comprehensive study
indicating that the amount of
silver that showing up in water
for human our livestock
insumption is less than one one
hundred of the exceptible level
that's established by the US
public health service.
Years ago when the texas
legislature was spending loud
seating in texas we took water
samples from storms that we knew
had been seated
and the amount of silver that
was showing up in the rain water
evidence that the seeding was
having some success
was.
Less than one two hundred and
fiftieth of the acceptable level
established by the public health
service so there's just been a
mountain of evidence showing
that the seating materials that
we customarily use in urging
thunderstorms along to shed more
rain water
is not any sort of an
environmental threat.
Thank you
representative for bringing this
bill for.
But it also brings.
It's about the potential.
So I just wanted to give us out
out besides the.
We also have incredible range
lane range land scientists.
And I know that is not
necessary.
Certainly like others have a.
A to be really thoughtful and
how the further.
Do additional measures.
Mse.
Of course there's the well known
and well regarded water
resource.
But also is really proud when
concerning mexicans brought
reasonable questions about.
I raise my hand quickly with
secretary king to s.
I want more than heard from
other.
To be part.
Where the science is coming from
so that they.
Technical information and their
products but so that we could
have new mexico grown science to
really help us flash out what.
Representative chat build as
this project progresses and
should you secure the spending I
would love to f.
And resources really about.
Yeah.
That was.
Yeah.
Yes okay so
I didn't realize that we were
already
offering.
That we were already.
Madam chair and representative
matthews most of the cloud
seating that has been licensed
to new mexico in my ten years.
Both of those
either were not licensed in time
for the funding period.
Collected.
My comment earlier was at the.
Closely with an.
I'm aware of another western
states.
Quite frequently and then.
Other states are d.
Automatic turn representative
matthews the licensing process
requires that the applicant.
Proof of ability to address
any claims of damages that could
be brought against them
associated with the clouds.
And that would mean.
Rules for managing weather
enhancement do state that if an
activity is going to be.
Activities I think have been
conducted that way historically
but this provides for a longer
period of study and therefore w.
Through our office and that goes
through a very public process
with the h.
This would go through that.
How long.
Madam chair representatives this
is george bomorag in
the studies that had been done
show
such an interminent testimony
small amount of silver
showing up in the water that
might be consumed
is such that over many many
years they would not be an
accumulation of enough.
Oh of of silver to be any sort
of an environmental thread
the study that I cited earlier
it goes back to when cloud
seating started in california
and the early nineteen fifties
up until the present time so
that's three quarters of the
century in the
summary from that report is the
amount of silver is
inconsequentially small.
If we approved this pile of
pride.
Madame chair I think silver
occurs n.
In the ground.
Yeah.
Yes madam chair representatives
george bummer again
much of the seeding that's being
done now in the western states
is hygriscopic in nature and not
glacy agentic and by that I mean
silver eye died is still the
conventional method of ceding
but we're finding a lot of
success using salts er the
cloribs and so over in texas for
example most seating events now
use a hybrid flare that's
carried on an aircraft er some
of which is silver in some of
which is chlorides and so as we
move into the future with more
extensive seating I think we're
going to see a greater reliance
upon the clorides is effective
seeding materials and less so
with metals like silver.
Madame to th.
Yeah.
The issue clouding this you.
And it's very important because
what they.
Dry eyes councilm chloride which
is.
Calcium chloride.
Although all the.
Madame.
Madam chair affected by.
Yes matter.
Been used.
Oh.
For clarificatio.
Yes madam chair representatives
the bloud that is most a minimal
to the seeding that we've been
talking about today is the
towering cumulas or a
thunderstorm scale a camel own
numbers clown it it turns out
that that cloud is responsible
for eighty to eighty five
percent of all of the rainfall
that occurs in a western state
such as new mexico
and so we're looking at
candidate clouds that are by
nature any fisher
they live for forty five minutes
or an hour and they process a
certain amount of
atmosphere in moisture but the
only deliver about a third of
that in the form of rainfall the
cloud then dissipates when we
add artificial ice crestos.
Using silver eye died or the
chlorides
we grow more rain drops in the
short life span of a ploud which
leads to a greater rain mass the
falls out of the cloud reaching
the ground as additional
rainfall.
Thank you very much for your
response here.
You're.
But this would be advantage.
I know th.
But the rop.
The book account
with the rotation of the earth
does that have the potential.
Share representative
that actually is a question that
comes off very often and what
they do is they calculate it in
such a way they ca.
Rain production so that it lands
with.
Primarily
madame cheer that that is
concerned of mind the only.
Madame cheer whenever this was
done guys staying over.
Roseville county I think it was
yes
how many
applica.
It's current time
the rosebook are sold and water
conservation district.
All right but I do want to
stress that there are no.
All of these are found natural
so the fear is unfound.
That are used.
Adam to that's all I have.
We are going to stay and.
Thank you madame chairs as we
move this built through this
committee today we hear all the
test.
Interesting and
I would like to
reinerate
about the same
that has progressed over the
years.
Not only here in texas or
neighbor to the east but in
other countries around the world
they have been doing this for
years and have collect.
Been there there's their
smariest in the world where they
have been persistent in doing it
and have seen increases in their
ring.
I would like to
mexico do this
have this bill
succeeds and.
Yeah there's some data
or we can help the residents of
the state of new mexico.
Till we see it on our own lan.
We probably will have a hard
time accepting
the here say about it but the
data is out there that it works
that it helps improve rainfall.
If we get it started here
we stand a chance to gather data
as to how it works here in new
mexico and and we know we're
narrowed state we don't we know
we don't.
As other states do.
Oranges when there we compare it
to eastern texas
but western texas has also had
some s.
Central western te.
I'd like to see this committee
support this bill
so that we can go forward with
data for the state in the mexico
and I believe i'll s.
The data shows it does.
After a few years.
We can look at it different but
i'd like to see this bill sta.
Help the clouds it in and and
gather some data
for not only the ad community in
the state any mexico but.
The more am in this committee.
Because really it is the
science.
The.
Yeah.
Representative armstrong.
Representative case yes
representative case b.
Yes.
Yes in all.
The.
And.
Where the natural defined
make sure water
representative.
I I apologize for referring to
naturally occurring elements as
chemicals but there are many
naturally.
The.
They can manage here I too I
believe in s.
You don't see the next year
thank you
congratula.
Thanks charlie and okay
representative
time to quote your bill.
The.
Eight humanity chair i'll be as
quick and consistent possible um
I would like to introduce my
expert witness tom patterson i'm
pattern in his family own and
operate the spurt ranch cattle
company between loon and albine
catron county new mexico they
started their calcaf operation
more than twenty five years ago
tom is the president elected
mexico capital where's
association he is a lifestock
industry representative
to the county livestock loss
authority where he serves as
vice chair tom the tom is the
wildlife committee chair for the
new mexican calibers association
and a long time member of the
board of directors
his
he recently retired after thirty
nine years as a trial attorney
life.
Practice was in natural
resources.
Repeatedly recognized
his commitment to environmental
stewart ship stewart ship in
their ranching operation
so out madame chair with
house bill.
I what this does.
Like I stated madam chair in my
opening statement my
introduction
is a lot of rural new mexico
people live where they live and
do what they do for whatever
reason the same reason people
live in urban.
I was raised on a ranch over by
data new mexico and I remember
adam chair on that long bus ride
the very first time I saw count
account
my mom and dad around the cattle
operation
small one
and I didn't know what it was I
had never seen one before and
and I was in elementary school
and so my m.
Then we talked about the
migration of the elk into new
mexico and what was happening
with that and and then we saw
the meal dear population kind of
go away a little bit night as
present.
While I was long gone in
nineteen ninety eight when the
mexican gray w.
Raising a family and starting
businesses in an urban new
mexico
and
what I have learned from my
friends and my neighbors that
still ranched by our family
ranch is what was going on and
and how it was affecting their
lively.
The economics when I was in high
school that I remember I really
didn't pay at.
But in in high school the
economics and our area was
logging.
Guide out
fitting
that was really the industries
that kept people in rural new
mexico and that was their
economic thrive drivers in that
area cabin ranching up.
And so looking at that and and
hearing the stories on how it
was affecting my friends in my
neighbors and now my
constituents are years later
almost thirty years later now
that I mistake representative
which was never in my.
I i'm proud to represent those
people.
This bill is about fair.
Conflict avoidance and this bill
is about knowing that the
mexican grey wolf is not going
away
and and trying to find a way.
Live with them instead of
fighting it all the time
we know they're here to stay so
that's what this bill is about
so house but when six.
Appropriate to nine million
dollars to the new mexico
department of agricu.
It's existing livestock ma.
Contract with the.
Contract with the county life
socklord loss authority acronym
c l LA
for fiscal years twenty five.
Constructed of secoral sierra
and cattering counties where the
majority of the mexican gray
wolfs are um I do have a map
that I just printed out it's
very hard to see but if you see
the little black dots you can
see that the mexican gray w.
Map that I receive madame
chairman.
Maybe by weekly
um
and these are only of the
colored ones we know madam chair
that there are a lot of
uncolored
um
so with that madam chair i'd
like.
Thank you madame thank you
madame chair and committee
members tom patterson i'd be
remiss to start without first
saying how grateful the li.
To the pipe bite tartison group
of legislators all the
legislators.
In the senate as well as here in
the house it's every legisla.
They have heard
as of this time last year there
at least two forty one mexican
w.
A hundred and thirty six.
Population numbers are rapidly
increasing worth dependations
are now outside th.
During twenty twenty three they
were confirmed.
Mexican wolves are also now
going north.
That a particular mexican worth
is made too very well publicized
trips the northern.
That was a work with the
tracking caller approximately
sixty percent of.
Lifestyle producers experience
two forms of damages from
mexican wars direct damages
which are the kills in the
injuries and indirect damages
which are the reduced conception
rates on her.
Weights when it comes time to s.
The missing cattle the counter
that we never find we put him
out in the past year went we
record their irreta.
Two months three months later we
go to bring him back in an often
it's a case we don't bring them
back in we ga.
And they're nowhere to be found
sometimes we find a carcass
often we don't interact damages
are those and also
the costs that ranchers incur
simply to manage their live
stock around the wools and
specific.
Re.
The mexican department of
agriculture estimates that the
cost of those damages that the
direct damages and the indirect
damages is three mil.
It's for the direct damages two
and a half million is for
indirect damage.
The seal as mandate sealey was.
Is to fairly and timely for the
first time ever compensate live
stock producers across across
new mexico
were there would related damages
catch in sierra and saquora
counties.
Grant from the federal
government were less than two
hundred thousand dollars simp.
Operation agreement have been
amended to listen to it.
Burned stride.
To make sure that ranches don't
do better with a compensation
program.
So are compensate amended by
laws and reading agreement
specify how compensation will be
paid for direct and indirect
damages payments are made within
fourteen.
With an investigation report
finding that the wolf was either
the con.
Federal funds will be exhausted.
Payments on dependations are
based on schedule that doctor
gifford be cattle extension
specialist new mexico state
repairs and consultation with
two are leading industry lie
stock.
This this appropriation will
faster conflict avoidance and
coexistence it's a new model
between it's a new model between
lies.
Compensation for damages will
disagree decrease the intensity
of the disagreements and lower
the volume on the acrimony it's
simply in present.
And thank you madame chair there
there's a lot
that goes into telling the story
about why we ranch and why we do
what we do but we do love to
feed new mexico.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hello.
Yes.
Well.
We are convinced.
Yeah.
These are catalan that we can't.
We find that car.
When.
When worked.
Yeah.
Yeah.
For some.
We've always ha.
In the area we have to go.
Age we have.
Yeah.
Right.
Are there.
This program director for that
life depends why they can
minister a live stock lost.
Yeah.
However I want to know that the
losses to the walls are very
small for action of all loss.
The.
I hear your hesitant
as i.
We believe it's really important
forward.
Support.
Around the world is proven to
work the problem with this bill
as written right now is that
there's not accountability in
the language yeah it doesn't
definition doesn't.
We would like to see this bill
include language guarantees they
branches are being health to
offset the costs
of loss
so extra range writers I scare
devices why start guarding those
whatever it might cost we'd like
to see that these funds help
them offset that.
We also think there's great
amount of really
use
no words paying for calls it
just don't come back for me put
out a passion that seems like
that's right so we do think
there are things done in this
bill and we stand ready to work
at the sponsors to amend it or
to work the graduation.
Yeah.
Thank you madame chair committee
members can you live with the
new mexico state land office the
state land office stands and
supported this bill thank you.
Madame chairman this is tracy
drummond
thank you
committee member for the
opportunity speak a rational
book or new mexico and i'm the
twenty seven year county
extension agent for catching
county so my ten year predate
the introduction of the world as
a whole number have increased we
see
dependations that increase
exponentially with those numbers
i've worked countless hours with
the ranchers a captain county to
to address and try to develop
management practices to
alleviate impacts from super
wood to date we found nothing
that eliminates that dependation
what we have found as if worked
our present there will be losses
as mentioned the other things
associate with that conception
rates lost weight and terms of
weening in etc that comes from
that presence of works
to date this process is the
closest thing we've come to
making of these individuals hole
and in conclusion i'd like to
state that there's no the live
stop producers of the southwest
part of the state and eventually
other parts of the state should
have to carry this program on
their back thank you madame
chairman.
Adam cheer th.
Madam chair I did.
Madame cheer whenever mrperiod
panson the expert.
Medicine.
Here in thirty six were
estimated.
Our estimate is it only
forty.
We don't know of that hundred.
We don't know how many of those
are colored or thank you ver.
Can you also and if you.
Crossed.
And.
All the way from.
Several of the that were calling
me to report the progress.
Yeah.
Response from the mexico.
What's your talk.
Madame I big to differ with the
director.
This female world for those.
So we're teaching bed.
We're talking about these.
The.
So.
Madame.
As far as protecting their
livelihood protecting their
children.
We're in close.
There was lots of lots of
discussion on l.
Then representative peter wor.
L.
Director of slow.
Here it is
and this is.
Is your analysis that states
lost determination would be made
by the US.
Yeah.
The US vision while.
Yeah.
And I believe that that would
you guys.
Madame.
You are following si.
Madame chair.
Represe.
This has been an ongoing problem
for eight.
There have been a.
County and tribal qualify.
Management.
Second.
Over in luna new mexico.
What this will do.
Through his training.
The training that will go
forward is being undertaken now
with saquora county for example
and the trainers.
From catching county.
Who has over.
In fact mister k.
Invest.
So we're we're drawing on all
those.
Footing.
Thank you madame chairman thank
you.
Somebody that hasn't been in the
r.
Agriculture business and
trying to produce food
for the state of new mexico and
the rest of the world.
May not understand what
indirect.
When when you're in the cattle
business you're looking at cast
of gain her pound
when you have a wharf out on
your ranch run in your cattle
off the water or
a wharf is one of the most.
Savage predators that we h.
These wolves
will go by.
To damage.
Get around and they won't
look to eat that cow.
But they will damage that cow in
a sense
where they can come back days
later and find her crippled up
and then
take her down for a ki.
When the counselor
you tend to lose cabs
because they will wait.
Till that cows push in that calf
out the birth canal and go up
there and kill that cash
before he ever stands a chance
to take his first breath
when we talk about worlds
we need to understand.
How vicious they are
and how they work.
When we see a bill like this
and then we see testimony here
to festivally and committee
about
we need to confirm these kills
the terrain that new mexico
that were blessed within the
state and new mexico doesn't
give us the opportunity
to have those cows looked at
every day on a daily basis
and be able to tell and count
all these kills and damages that
the wolves do.
I appreciate this bill c.
I don't know if this is enough
money.
For to cover these ranchers
for their losses
I look forward to learning more
and seen more data.
But as we go forward this is a
good peace of the puzzle
so many times we have been
infringed upon in the state of
new mexico as fa.
Yeah word work told that we have
to live with it
and if we're gonna have to live
with it
we ought to have the
understanding
as a whole
of the cast
not only to the farm.
And this pertains more than
ranchers and farmers but it also
involves
the the farmers that in the ad
community
but to the people of the new
mexico and what it cost to put
but food on the table
at the end of the day it's the
consumer that pays for these
costs
when it cost us more to pro.
The stores today everybody knows
what AP.
Presenters thank you for
bringing this bill forward and
look forward to supporting it.
And I look forward to learning
more.
The populations of the world's
increase I think we'll see
bigger problems with this in the
future manager.
Advocacy leading up to today's
committee hearing madam chair
representative I was trying it
was shared with me that these
nine million dollars.
I'm assuming that might be part
of existing lifestock mexican
with compensation program.
Madame chair representative.
We'll be used for.
And that should be clear.
Anna expert i've i've confirmed
those two things but i'm asking
specifically about conflict
mitigation costs things like the
range rover range writers drove
the range writers and other
things is that also in the
language here manager
representative yes where is that
madame chair and it's part of
our losses it's in our interest.
To go out and avoid con.
Madame chair and and
representative that would be
part of the indirect costs um
for that so we.
Pay for possible range writers
in the area dogs if they have
dark.
Sipically is not named in here
but it would be part of.
Under that information and also
for the direct damages and the
kills they have to be.
Thank you madame chair and
sponsor
if if I might suggest I see
unpage two here you have the
point.
Legislation moves forward to
name directly that it's also
conflict mitigation when I hear
inter.
I i've heard and and been
compelled to what that means but
that's still to me sounds like
it's.
It'll be run off the water based
on other things so it sounds
like after there's been harm
that there's compensation for
the harm that was less so than
the additional resources to
prevent.
Considered a friendly amendment
beyond this committee and as you
move forward to just at another
point to clarify that I think as
they understand it also is
within the existing lifestyle
program today but because it's
not n.
Humanity chair we will consider
that and.
Representative
I think you chair and and and
thank you
representative for bringing this
bill forward I know that this
committee last year heard many
stories about how the increase
of compensation is so needed
we didn't even talk about just
certain it instead of um dollars
per pound.
That is essential to your herd's
dna and and there are many other
things that medicating expenses
and I very much appreciate you
bring it forward I do want to
say that I have some concerns
about
such as what will bring it then
that is only
for a certain.
Just talked about a wolf going
outside those counties and I am
concerned that it is only in
those counties if we're gonna do
an amendment i'm going to hit
some ideas I would like to see
it state wide I understand that
the fond is being managed
through the livestock mexican
world compensation fine but I
would.
Language in here that said like
protective predators
because I would hate for a
clever attorney to say I don't
there's a lack of evidence from
this specific predictor and I
would like to be able for the
re.
Protective predators in the
future
and then the increase I I
understand that you're covering
interact and that's really what
it is it's not that it's more
money port per cattle it's that
you've expand the death.
And chairman representative case
yes and and thank you and I do
think I did have one other
concern that I think you've
already answered it about who
how are you
are you monetarising these
indirect losses obviously ran it
is monetaries you come every day
so I mean they know they know
when they have.
Weights and things like that but
I will say that in your next
round
to be able to say what are the
processes of conf.
I will see that I i'm very happy
that you brought this forward
but.
And I want to support it on the
floor but
i'm gonna need representative
arms strong to talk to me
through it or in amendment to
make these things more specific
and more state w.
Look forward to supporting the
floor.
Thank you madame thank you for
those concerns right now the
where the mexican grey world
wolf the reason it's in those
three counties is because that's
where it's all started and has.
Room to expand across the state
you know colorado's introduced
the timber wolf and so i'm sure
we'll be getting more and then
they'll be crossed reading or
whatever happens so there is
room for expansion the reason
it's in those three is because
that's where they are right now
known by the mexico game and
fish that's the that's the area
where they're at i'm also there
is a lot of reporting done some
of the interact would be you
know you're your breed back
would be less you would have to
prove there's al.
Your breed back spent ninety
eight percent for the last ten
years.
On your land and game camera
pictures range riders have seen
them on on your ranch our
particular ranch we do hire a
range writer when we cave our
halfers
because they are some other
multiple.
Cow that's happened their first.
Really closely but we do higher
arrange writer
to do that in a lot of.
So there are a lot of
protections in there and a lot
of rules and regulations it's
not just paying because a cat a
ranch.
Just one more thing madam chair
a confirm kill with the wolf
there they have certain k
ninetieth there's different
teeth and and were concerned
about you know if if it's a kyot
I can shoot a kyle
if it's a wolf.
And so we're concerned about the
mexican grey wolf right now and
that's why the.
Kind of a wrap up of your bill
okay and then.
Representative armstrong
yes.
Representative because they
know.
And now with the previous
reasons why.
Representative.
Representative.
