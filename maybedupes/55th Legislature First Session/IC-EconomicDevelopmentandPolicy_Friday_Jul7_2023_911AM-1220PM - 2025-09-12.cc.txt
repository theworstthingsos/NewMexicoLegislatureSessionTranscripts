Good morning everybody.
It is actually Friday
just for money because sometimes we forget
and especially with a holiday in the middle of the
week it's a little
bizarre to remember what day it
is.
I'm senator Kerry Hammon
and honored to be serving as chair
of the economic and rural development
and policy committee
also very excited to have state
representative during Vegas
also from southern New Mexico to serve
as vice chair.
Today we are going to learn more about
under represented populations
in trades and apprenticeships
understand the challenges experienced
in The New Mexico's real
estate development process and finish
up with supporting employees with
disabilities what
if we have folks wanna make public
comment will have that at the end of the
day today at around
230 for those
watching on the webcast thank you so
much for tuning in
reminded committee members
we are wanting to be respectful
of the folks who are here speaking with
us today they are here
at our request and many
giving up their day sometimes their
pay invaluable time away from work
to come talk to us so I'd like
us to be respectful
of their time and keep our questions
to the topic at hand
certainly do my best to keep us on
track and on time
and and
also make
sure that we
respect those
folks who are here and
trying get them out on time
although I I do want to warn you
this committee is very
curious and
has a a lot of questions
and a lot of thought full
Committee on on
things and so I'm grateful for
that. And
so we're going to start
off with under
represented populations in
trades and apprenticeships
and you
know I I was talking with John
before this and and
it. Might
escape from
the stressors that is life is watching
television that I don't have to
think a whole lot about
but that I enjoy and one of those
is a is a show that just started
called tough
as nails and it highlights people
in the trades
and it is a reality
show
however what I found in there
was the the immediate
sense of family.
Up by people who are in the trades
in these are folks who are doing
tasks
the inner like last night it
was bagging
fertiliser and loading
it up on a truck
and then pulling
side and then
send setting in
a sprinkler an
aerator system into an ounce
upon no this is taking
place up and Canada
but it's a
lovely way of showing how
important the folks who are
doing the hard work and
in our trades how valuable they
are to our communities and so I'm
grateful that we have this
opportunity here to talk about
this under represented populations
and so we have the president of C. N.
M. once again thank you for being
our host Tracy
and your crew you've been absolutely
fabulous and accommodating and we're
very grateful
for having the space
we also have a share
in Gordon Moffit who is the associate
dean of the skilled trades and arts at
C. N. M. thank you for
being here Erin
Johnson craft to is the senior
director employer and
industry management at C. N.
M.. Thank you for
being here and then we have
joined a Baker who is the director
and political affairs and outreach
of the United association local
union for 12
so thank you for being here so I'm not
let you go ahead we have
until about 1030
ishe so
I know Aaron kind of gave you
the kind of the the parameters
of the presentation
I know the I say
that because I know this committee will have
questions and it's not like
a grilling it's it's
it's really wanting to learn more
and the thing that we always ask
is as legislators is what
is it that you need from the
legislature to make it
easier for you
and the folks to do their jobs
so I'm gonna go ahead
and the to start will if you want to
go ahead and if you've already like
rock paper scissors how you're going

more committees
and legislators here on this campus
and and again many others
across the state
so I'm gonna keep you on time but not
saying anything more just to say thank
you for your time
and we really look for your questions this
morning.
Good morning chairwoman Hamlin
members of the committee it
is a pleasure
and a privilege to be presenting
this morning and sharing
a presentation on under
represented populations
in trades and apprenticeships
we will be highlighting our women
in trades
opportunities and
challenges.
This morning my name
as mentioned earlier my name is Sharon
Gordon Moffit I'm currently the
interim dean
of the school of skilled trades
and arts as of last
Monday
working with central New Mexico
community college it's a pleasure
for me to be working with my
colleague Aaron Johnson
press she is a senior
director of employer
and in industry
engagement through our
workforce and community
success at central
New Mexico community
college.
So just a few highlights of what
this presentation will be
about we're going to be
focusing on our initiative
with women in trades
I'm gonna share a little bit some
national trends
I'm gonna be sharing some
snapshot snapshot
of program data
from C. N. M..
I'm gonna talk about our women's
in trade with women in
trade summit.
When I share a few inspirational
stories with you from some of
our amazing students
will discuss funding.
And then we will be talking
about workforce success
and work based learning and
C. N.
M..
So to start off with I just wanted
to share a brief
definition of what skilled
trades is and and then
that salads jobs in
construction and related building
industry manufacturing
and transportation
requiring specialized
skills at
C. N. M. we have
10
skilled trades
programs the study you'll see
them listed there from carpentry
to electrical
photovoltaic
industrial technology
is a new one mechatronics
we also have these really quick then
technology along
with aviation
maintenance.
So with women in trades
it's really difficult
to pin down the
data
after looking based on
the U. S. bureau of labor
statistics I found that
it is estimated
that approximately 10.9
percent of the direct
skilled trades
workforce
in the United States is
female.
We are moving the needle here at
CNM with
approximately 14
percent of our skilled trades
students being
female.
Our growth we've had
significant growth in this
area since
2013.
So a little bit of the data from
seeing them going back to
2013 just
showing
the enrollment numbers in the school
or skilled trades in
arts you'll notice
that our female population
has been creeping
upward
since fall of 2013
this is good news in the
skilled trades
while our enrollment dropped in
2020 to the
pandemic we
continue to
trend upwards
at C. N. M. R. team from
enrollment management and student
services are working hard in
the community to
connect to help students get
started at CNM
in skilled trades
we continue to
reach potential
new students through
events such as organized
community informational
sessions summer
boot camps C.
N. M. open house
and participation in
CTE even so cross
the
college.
So here's a snapshot just
a basic snapshot
of our enrollment numbers by
gender and 5
of our skilled trades
programs at
CNM it's
important to note that our female
enrollment has and has
constant consistently
increased
and it looks like our automotive
technology and welding
programs continue to see
an increase of females
and we hope to see that
increase across the
board.
So now I want to talk a little bit about
the women in trade summit
hopefully all received a sticker
at your seat so
the woman a trade summit is the
brain child of
Representative Herndon
I'm sorry she's not here yet
but back in 2022
she reached out to our former
dean Dr Amy
Ballard with
this idea
so a steering committee was
launched and the
first summit was
held in
2022
with approximately
100 attendees
and 17
employer booths
the support for business and
injury industry partners
for this event has been
incredible.
This is an opportunity to bring
together local industry leaders
to address topics of interest
to trades women
and just firing trades
women. There were
hands on demonstrations
well attendees were able
to learn more about the
trades this event
focused on current and
potential new
students
and tunings were able to meet with
employers and
visit a variety of industries but
with earlier this
year we celebrate the
second annual women in
trade some act
with approximately
400 attendees
and 32
employer booths
so a big thank you
to Representative Herndon for
reaching out to as with her
idea and her
continued support women in
trades will be
planning next
year's summit
soon.
So as mentioned our target
audience for women in trades
as potential new students
and current students
women looking to change
their careers
we saw that with the great
resignation with the
pandemic women
are pivoting and changing their
jobs they want to
pursue more money
make a higher
income.
Many women especially single
mothers are they
need a more flexible work
schedule and
many simply are
unhappy in
their current job experiencing
burnout
and they're no longer enjoying the work
they do. So
at this point I want to show a
quick video is
Peter. We're gonna
show just a short video
of one of our amazing CNN
welding students Alyssa
Copeland.
So if you don't mind you can turn you'll
see the
scale.
We have to limit
my a bit.
The job before and
I see it as
something a little bit more I
would appreciate
it my
and.
This is a serious thing I've
ever but I'm so
glad it is now I'm
working in an industry
that studying for school
and by that
I raise
the pre clean
replacement
I can be part of
something
that hospital
bills may I have a little
bit more for this I
graduated
spring of next year and I'm
not 100 percent sure what my
question is hi this
is a welder and work
somewhere right I had
used by for someone
considering coming to
seeing it
is the best decision I
made my higher
life it's scary
but it's worth
it.
All.
So the next slide in your
packet shows a
few photos of some of our
inspirational CNM
students you'll notice
on the upper left we've got
Christina Horton construction
technology in the top
middle and bottom right
is a list of who we just saw on the
video bottom
left is Esperanza
Martinez she's a welding student
and then in the bottom metal
we have actually Simpson
in the electrical trades
each of these students have
a story to tell
and I have a similar
story.
Early in
1980
in the early eighties I enrolled
at what was TV online completed
the nursing program
after working for more than 20
years the last
10 of those years I was in the our
nurse. And
then in the early 2000 my
son was
young wanted a go
kart so I
enrolled at TV I in the
welding program learned
about machining
completed the program and was
recruited from Sandia
national by Sandia national
labs and served
as an intern machinist
and that photo in the operate
is me working as a machinist
at St at
Sandia.
With the my internship
was up I was recruited
by TV I
when I started work almost 20
years ago with the
best college in the country
so we all have a
story.
We need to change the
story now as to
why women
why now the
potential appeal for
4 trades for female
is as high as it's ever
been there is
high pay
highincome.
Folks are looking to find
meaning in their work
meaning and value.
Many are pursuing their passion
you heard a little bit about a list of the
student that was he just
saw they like to
have a hands on learning
they want to build
something and
the and many of them are looking
for that flexible
schedule.
Again why women why
now some
of our largest shortage areas
we're looking at on
in your presentation
you'll see automotive
we have very few women
working in these these different
fields the information
that I provided is
from the
beer of label labor
statistics women in the labor
force and it really
demonstrates
how women are largely under
represented in many of the
skilled labor labor
positions automotive
repair and maintenance only
9.7
percent come to
see and then we have a great
automotive technology
program offering certificates
and degree
once again electronic and
precision equipment
there is a need their CNM
Office of robust
electrical trades
program.
Manufacturing
there's a high need for that seeing
them recently launched our
industrial automation
technology program are
mechatronics
and then metal working
machinery CNM
offers a great
machine tool technology
program offering certificates
stackable certificates
and a degree
program.
So once again why women
why now the
societal needs are out
there.
It is with that
with folks retiring
older workers in the skilled
trades are retiring and
seen is doing our
best to help
train people to fill
those positions
every business analysts and
industry partner.
Keep us CNM
for more students to
hire.
Is a great time for women for
all students
because the return on
investment is
remarkable with low cost
of tuition and depending on
the program training can
be received in just
one or 2 years one
or 2 terms or
one to 2
years.
So unfortunately there is a
negative connotation
there's a trade stigmatization
for for
females often
times.
Skilled trades work
suffers because
there's a lack of interest or
formal training many
of our middle school high school
students do not have the opportunity
to the school to explore the
pathway of skilled
trades.
We have often found
that many of the folks going
to trade the specially
women do it because they
had a family member that was in the
trades their dad their
uncle.
A lot of folks think
some of the old stories or
that. Rates
are for kids that
don't have to have
academics
they don't need to be smart
in reality they have to be
very smart with some of our high
tech equipment.
There are folks think
it's dirty work
when in reality some of our
state of the art equipment is
it's it's hi tech
working
with.
Lot of folks feel that
if you go into the trades you're
gonna lose some of your
femininity when
I was a welding and machinist and I
made sure to wear earrings and lipstick
every single day.
And a lot of the boys are
worried that the girls are gonna
just show them up.
And they usually do.
So some of this actual
problems old school
attitudes we need to work on
changing
there's a real lack of female
mentors and trainers that
we're working on trying to
change.
Lot of these folks have family
responsibilities
so the flexible schedule
is a necessity
and then a lack of exposure
and training at the
secondary
level.
At this time I want to show one more
quick video
did Pedro if
this is our welding
student Marie I'm
sorry H. back
H. fax it.
Go ahead. As
in all dominated
field that
it would be nice to see other women
actually pursuing it is
possible but a
little
cardboard.
It is thank you for
your.
And I just
started doing as a halter
and. No
with an
important.
Yes
I always get that
windfall bureau as it is
level on that
girl.
12 year old so it's
loading.
21 thing actually
makes it when everyone around
you says
no no
I just
wanna Office.
As a group
option.
I wanted to
kind of falling
under women's
insurance.
It is
that.
Very.
And just saying over
the.
Okay good morning
I'm Aaron Johnson Croft
chair Hamlin and members of
the committee and glad to be presenting
the remainder of
this presentation for
for you today on behalf of
C. N. M. so I'm gonna talk
a little bit about some of the funding
of course one of
our main sources of funding is I.
Angie funding and we
actually rely on that in addition
to mill
levies and bonds but
the Perkins grant is
one of those
largest funding
sources for career technical
education and for
trades
C. N. M. as
repeat.
40 of Perkins
and we are good stewards of those
funds
from the Perkins funding really
pays for the majority of
professional development
for career technical
and trades faculty
as well as professional development
for us as administrators
to be able to keep
abreast of best practices
and state
of the art technologies and things
that are going on in
industry it
also helps pay for
equipment expansion
of existing programs
and funding for
new career technical
our traits programs
curriculum development
and
equipment the one
thing that it doesn't cover though
is capital projects
so any time we have a new
program of course we
have advanced skills
labs right and sometimes there's
a remodeling that needs to happen
with that and so that's just
one of the areas that is a
need for any type of
institution that's going to be
in parking on
career technical education
or trades education because we have
to have a dedicated
lab space that
is current I'm an
example was for our sonography
program we expanded that
and we got new machines
but because of the electrical power
needed for those new machines
we had a remodel and redo
all the electrical in the space
right and the Perkins grant
doesn't pay for that part
of the investments
that institution might need to do
so I just wanted to mention
that.
And then of course is part of Perkins we
are required to work with our K. 12
partners and
in our region into work to
foster those pathways
into post secondary so I just
wanted to make sure that that was
mentioned.
And then
of course we
are so grateful and thankful
for the probation
that will be receiving here now this
fiscal year there's a
list of their in your
packet and so
we want to say thank
you.
Representative Herndon has
been a strong supporter of
women in the trades and so we're
receiving additional money for that
so we want to say thank you to
her as well
as the
other representatives and
senators listed on this
list.
We are working
to.
The very
and thanks to Representative
Matthews for the
recruitment of under
represented populations
dollars so I
think we're going to have a dedicated
position it's going to help us
with that
recruitment and support
of under represented
populations in the
tree.
I'm moving on to workforce
success so
under president Carter's leadership
we have undergone a large
re organization of college this
past year so and we
have a new division called workforce
and community success that's the area
that I'm working in my
position is new for the college
my position is pretty rare
employer and industry engagement
maybe some large other metro
kind of colleges and other parts
of the country have a position similar
to mine but it's really
to help funnel
and have a more centralized point
of contact for our
employer partners and industry
partners so we can kind
of have a one stop shop for
them and to support their needs
for workforce training
hiring recruitment
and kind of creating those job
matches for our students
so we couldn't do what we do
without our employer partners
we also work closely with the
economic development organizations
in our area several
of us are
on boards of
some of these organizations
others from the college
attend events
for these
organizations and then we
also do joint event so
a recent one that we just did with the
state economic development
department is
supporting all the employers
to receive J. took funds
doing a large hiring event
specifically for those
companies who are
needing to hire
to meet their goals
related to the need to
requirements so that
was a big success and something that
we're happy to partner
and help support and
then of course we have advisory
committees we
couldn't do what we do without
that input and
support of our programs the
advisory committees are requirement
of the Perkins grant but
we would be doing those anyways just
because it's such a huge and
crucial part to
informing our curriculum
ensuring that we have up to date
equipment or technology in our
programs and
providing that opportunity
for those partners to provide
input to us
as programs
in the college.
And
and then of course are
you partners and the
chambers and they often
some of the other
organizations working to
promote economic development in
our
region.
Work based learning opportunities is
another area within our
workforce and community success
division that we
are scaling
and growing with
investment of having some dedicated
person to work
on this support
so work based learning could be everything
from apprenticeships internships
to service learning to
practicals to clinicals
right there's a lot of different categories
of work based learning
job shadowing is another one that we're going
to be launching here pretty
soon just
depending on the industry
sector but
in the skilled trades we
definitely have lots of
internships and other
relationships with our
partners to
help students earn
while they're learning right
I think that's the key to give them
that
opportunity to receive some
funding while they're in
school but then also that
connection right having
a research shows that the more
work based learning experiences
an individual or student has
that gives them more
opportunity to
be placed in a job then
after they're done with their
education
many students go on to continue
their education after they leave C.
N. M. but having that
direct connection to an employer
for an internship or apprenticeship
type of opportunity really
increases their social capital
or social networks and
create some of those relationships
to help them
land that full time job
and then many of those employers will
continue to pay
their education expenses
as they continue on their journey
so that's something
that we are
really excited about we're working much
more closely with our
industry partners and then
even helping support some
of those employers who don't have
an internship job
category or an internship
opportunity that currently
exists helping them create
that and providing that
resource and support to help
and kind of figure out how to navigate
that internally within their
organizational structure
so super exciting work
that we're doing you should
have also have a more detailed
handout if it's
not in your packet it's going. Be over on
the side table.
So then the next
one is.
Now is the time right
why females why
now skilled
trades right we know
there's a. Major
workforce shortages going on
in specific trades
of course pretty much every industry right
now in the tight labor market that
we're in
we're super excited that just
last week we broke ground on
our new traits facility
in some of those videos use
on the background or touch this
call which is I think the oldest
building on our whole campus
at me and so
we're super excited to be able
to.
Have that investments and working
with our community and our partners
to do the building something that
is state of the art
hi tech that's going to be a fabulous
space for students to
learn.
So that is our last
slides so thank you for your
attention and we are
now open for
questions unless you want
to go to the next
presentation.
Thank you chair Hamblen
members the committee
for having me here today
I don't know if
my presentation
comes up or
sorry.
Okay.
Okay
so skilled trades
and apprenticeship
and rural New Mexico my
name is John Baker
on the political affairs director
and outreach director
at the UA local for
12 K. committee you do
have this in front of you this is the
presentation
that the plumbers and
pipefitters
union.
So just a short
introduction of of who
we are in case you don't know
to a local for 12 representative
plumbers pipefitters
welders and H. back
technicians and
we're an affiliation with the southwest
piping Institute which
services are registered
apprenticeship
program.
And then I can
all.
Here we are thank you so
much hi
quicker. Our
membership is just over
2000 strong
cross the state line counties
in West Texas
we have 54 signatory
contractors who use our
labor were of sole source
hiring hall.
And we just reached over
450 apprentices
this is double the
amount that we had a
year point 5 ago
so the growth in
all apprenticeships right now is
on president
we have 4 training locations
around New Mexico that is
Farmington.
Los Alamos
Albuquerque and
Los crucis
we are getting ready to open
one in
Espanola
20 percent of our
apprentices are located
outside of the metro area
so according to the
USDA
it's not just Albuquerque considered
metro but lost the
actual city Los crucis
and the city of Farmington are
both considered metro so I'm talking
outside of those metro areas
outside of Santa Fe metro
area.
We have the highest
enrollment.
Of rural
apprentices.
Our efforts in rural New
Mexico so we
are getting ready to take training
to them you'll see a
picture in the works of
our 38 foot mobile
classroom
this will be training and rural
and tribal communities
in northern New Mexico the
first 2 years because this
was given to us on the good
jobs grant
it'll be launched October 23
after the first 2 years it'll
be free to do to go
across the
state
we have partnerships with the Navajo
tech Zuni
pueblo in northern New Mexico
college and northern New
Mexico economic development
which was our partner and good jobs
grant.
Did I go to.
So it challenges
that we see in rural New
Mexico for apprenticeship is
access funding
available work and
enforcement.
So when we talk
about access I want to make
sure that everyone knows here
madam chair that
department of workforce solutions
and the apprenticeships themselves
are making valiant
efforts to get into
rural New Mexico I just want to
make sure that everybody knows
how much hard work is going
in but
most registered apprenticeships
are in Albuquerque
I have identified 5
that are active apprenticeships
outside of a metro
area right
so we have some in
Farmington and and things
like that but I'm not considering
those up
rural.
And just to the best
of our calculations and
working with apartment of workforce
solutions
because it's hard to tell like
where they were recruited
from and and things
like that but to the best of our calculations
we believe 9 percent of
registered apprentices
are
are from rural New Mexico
and to address these issues
we need to look at the
root causes and that
is
to increase access we must
address all 3
of the other items.
So one of those is funding
and I want to take a quick moment
to talk about funding when I was
in the legislature with you all
last year and and
we had to bill's going right
we had one to
4 P. what and we had
one for the friendship assistance
act in there was a lot of confusion
as to is this the same
bill and it absolutely is not
so the apprenticeship assistants
Act funding goes
to any
type of apprenticeship
there are some for Barbary there's
some for health care there's even
one at Santa Fe community college
for early childhood education
so this isn't just
skilled trades this is
any body who wants to do a
registered apprenticeship.
Currently it is reimbursing
at $1
95 per hour
per apprentice.
Last year it was
$2.47
because of the
expansion of how
many apprentices
are in registered apprenticeship
without increase in
funding
it it created a
a cut
the other set of state funding
is is the P. want the public
works apprenticeship
training so
this funding depends
it depends on
how much money was paid
in to the P. what
fund and
how many apprentices
qualify so
the apprentices have to have so
many hours on public
works projects
to qualify for their funding
to help pay for their
for their schooling
and then there's the third bucket which
is other private fundings
grants fees
tuition
of and then we
get ours through our collective
bargaining agreement and then
respond
95 percent plus
of the funding is in this
bucket.
So my provided
recommendations
is to increase the
apprenticeship assistants Act
funding from
600000 of
an inter agency
transfer right
so what they do is they
take
workers comp funds
and they do inter agency
transfer to get over to
apprenticeship I would like
to see dedicated funding
not an interagency transfer
what if one here that doesn't happen
right then there's no
funding
I would like to see the appropriation
to be no less than 3000000
or $660
per
$6.60
per print just for
our
and this act
only pays for
220
hours a year
of training so if
training goes beyond that
220 hours
it it doesn't cover
that.
Secondly
remove hi way
contractors exemption
exemption from paying into
people.
14 percent of all
capital outlay is used
for roads
billions of dollars
are coming through the bipartisan
infrastructure loft
for our roads
we will miss an
opportunity of
taking.
Those federal funds
and re investing them
into workforce
development
this is a quote from the US
department of commerce dollar
for dollar no
workforce training method
packs a better punch
as a permission
on average employers
were realize a
return on investment of
$1 47 for
every dollar invested
additionally every dollar
invested in apprenticeship
leads to a public return
of approximately $28
and benefit
that's a higher return than early
childhood education from
the secondary
almost double
so
this is a good
investment for
business and this
is a good investment for
the
state.
The other challenge we have is
available work
so.
There's there's state
buildings right
that and
and capital outlay
there's municipal buildings
that's the small county
building
is city hall
the courthouses those types
of things we
have quite a bit of federal here
in the state of New Mexico
103 federal
buildings and then
private so that these are
either residential or
private
commercial.
Of buildings
now you say well we have a ton of
that in Los crucis
yet you a local for 12
only has 10 apprentices and
Maastricht's
why is
that.
It's due to available
work and
how do we look at available
work and
put the scales where
we are putting our money
where our mouth is and
saying we value workforce
development therefore
the state should spend its
money the way
that it off holds its
values we
need to address issues
within the state procurement
law currently state
procurement law
requires
lowest bidder
lowest bidder is always
bad for the worker
we need to ensure
that state projects capital
outlay projects
require workforce
development so that you
know your state dollars
spent are being put
back into the
community
one of the ways to do that
again is registered
apprenticeship we
need to encourage the smaller
municipalities
to use project labor
agreements
those do have a you
component maybe you don't want to
go there you could encourage
community benefit agreements
or responsible contractor
language when there
is use of capital outlay funds
in those municipalities.
We have an opportunity
right now a huge
one with the chips
Act the bipartisan
infrastructure long
and the inflation reduction
act all
require registered
apprenticeship to do
those jobs to do that
work. Now
the inflation reduction act
is going to bring in heat pumps
in the residential area
okay
very very
few
I'm talking like maybe
3
of contractors
do residential work
and have it registered
apprenticeship so we
have a huge opportunity to
really expand
here.
And to back up the
NM to get this
work done now how
is the time more than ever
to get women into the trades
to to book building need
to get this work
done.
The other thing we need to
look at is enforcement
so on license contracting
is an epidemic in New Mexico
in the building trades
and it is the most common in
rural areas
under licensed or misclassified
skilled trades work is
rampant in New Mexico as
well so we
have
one journeyman plumber on
the job according to
see ID there are
2.
On registered
apprentices.
Could be as of a
tradesman
or.
An apprentice that isn't through register
depression program or registered
apprentice.
We have jobs that
there may be one licensed
journeyman on the job to
say 7 on
nice. Sorry
excuse
me.
This is costing the state
budget
millions.
I did a.
Study.
About 4 years
ago.
It.
I believe that the state
is losing
$19000000
a year in gross
receipts.
Just on residential
water heaters being
installed by on
licensed
contractors.
That was the only information
I could gather because it's
so hard to tell what
work was done licensed and what
one was done on
license.
We are costing jobs and
we are creating a race to the
bottom in the
industry.
My recommendations is to
provide the construction
industry division or the
authority having jurisdiction
proper budgets for
enforcement
launch public service
announcements to inform
consumers and small
municipalities
on the dangers of using
unlicensed work how to protect
themselves and how to find out if the
person or company
is properly licensed to do
that work I want to I want to share
a small story
here.
So in Valencia County
this ties to enforcement
and it ties to
state procurement.
In 20 County they needed
a new package unit on the
tail. And
because they had to go with the lowest
bidder.
The company and
and I can't even
necessarily say if they were
if they were licensed
because they didn't pull a
permit.
They did
$800
less.
Then the other company
and they got the
project.
When that
package unit was later
seen it
was missing an
economizer
economizer is bring in
fresh air turnover which we
all learn the importance of during
the COVID
and they're required on commercial
buildings it was missing that
economizer guess how much
economizer costs.
$800
and
so.
They wouldn't have passed
a permit or inspection
without that economizer
so now.
There's this units
the minister Palicki paid
for that
is not up to
standards.
And we need to increase fines
and punishments for doing on
licensed are on light
under license to miss classified
work.
And with that I'll.
Make sure we have plenty of time to questions
thank you okay I don't know
if present if you wanted to
make any other comments I know that there
were some questions that were asked of you
yesterday
I do want to be respectful
of time so I don't know if you
want and then if you want
to address those questions that were
brought up and then we'll open it up
for questions from the committee
actually so thank you very much
Center thank you for the
incredible insight and
presentation
material so number of the
members yesterday asked a very
specific questions about credit for
prior learning asked
about our faculty salaries
and asked about accessibility
services I'm really
proud of my staff and
colleagues were able to generate
a lot of information
however it is not really
easily digestible to
most people so
I would like to say that we will follow up
after today to make sure
that we're responsive to the request so
I we are not I don't
consider what just unresponsive I
would say we were so
eager to be responsive.
It was really going to be quite a bit of material
for you all to sit there so
I'll I'll respond to that I mean
look at that after after
today so with that
but I do want to I really appreciate
that the chair's comments to
say what can legislators
do what how can you help
us do good work
and I you certainly heard
funding but
I would start with hold us
accountable you give
us a great deal of
funding may not always
be enough in the right buckets.
Are we may say that but I would say
that holds accountable
first again
you all and and and your
and the members the legislature
very clear about our
projects
about the
expectations for
the funds that you set aside
not only for scene but for all
I'd say all of institutions
and we want to make sure that we're responsive
to that we show you
the with your your support
your confidence in us to do good
work that we actually do
it so I think first is
hold us accountable for the money
that you're you're directing
to us and again I think
them and let Representative
her to join us and certainly
others have supported C. N.
M. I think we
showed some of that progress today
in our presentation
where their support here's
here's measures we increased
attendance we increased participation
we're showing how we're
going to expand work based learning I
think there's no question of
my colleague here noted that with
more money we can get more premises
out because they're such a great demand
so I'm excited
that we can show you
results for for how
you're supporting us and
I think that's number one and then I
think you heard other requests for
funds that that are important
and I would say for us
continuing support
for mentorship
for your role modeling
not only at night saying the
traces as
dean of
Moffit that it
shared with us earlier
but I do think there are some elements there
and I think yesterday we really I
also raised the point of how can
we help our employers.
With all state
incentives.
To help us get the
instructors we need
create the work based learning
or the partnership opportunities
because we know that takes time
for them to set up an apprenticeship
program or
some work based learning it
had it takes time for them to
bring instructor or
employee to take them off the
floor or off the job
to do certain work to mentor
others but I also
had the benefit of.
Meeting one of our
faculty yesterday who is
also running room brewery
and doing some other work but she's about
part of faculty members she
absolutely knows the
commitment of what it meant
to step into our
classrooms to
basically recruit
employees.
She's done that with great
success
and so I can see but again
that comes at a cost right that's a
sacrifice for
employer to step in and say
here's how we can not only train the next
generation identify individuals
frankly commented own own
the business take on that business at
small business that we all known
want here not only
in central New Mexico but across the
state particularly
so we know that these kinds of
experiences are beneficial
so I'd really appreciate
the legislature and you
and others help us think way
about ways to help
really incentivize employers
who are already at the table and see a
great need but who may
need some assistance because it means
our productivity
frankly
perhaps goes down in the short term
but we know in the long term is what's
great for New Mexico so
I'd I'd say with that I really
appreciate again the opportunity and I know
will stand well I guess
was that was.
Any questions this
morning
antiseptic you so much
I do have one quick question and then
we'll go to Representative Martinez
and then Representative Montoya
Representative Matthews
Representative Armstrong and Representative
Lujan the
house and then Representative
Rehm and the Senate
kicks in with senator Ron
Griggs said.
I just
quickly
how have you see you don't have to
necessarily give numbers but have you
seen the opportunity scholarship
impact because I know that doing in
a community college has seen increased
by their attendance increase
enrollment increased by 200
percent already.
So great question the question was
about the options
scholarship and how that's
benefited our
students are learners are and see
NM we know that
last year we saw an increase of
thousands of students from about
3000.
In 2122
to about 7000 plus
students last
fall and we're
still calculator numbers from last
year we see a dramatic increase so
we know that matters
I do think we are now challenge
to make sure that
we make this program a little bit simpler
to administer it's it's pretty
challenging make it
standardized across all institutions
as well and also
make sure there seems to be retained
right getting them in the door is 1
element but we certainly know that it takes
more than just getting students in the
door they need that continued
support and so we're
expanding that as well so making
sure students continue to be
eligible is critical
and of course we've seen
incredible growth in our adult
learners and releases
returning students who I think are
a great benefit that was the initial
intent intent of that
scholarship opportunity so
we're it's definitely helped our
enrollment we want to make sure we're
seeing that growth year over year
not just in that 1 year
fortunately our fall is looking pretty
good. On
July 7.
Noted
thank you thank you very much
Representative
Martinez.
Thank you madam chair I I have
just a couple
questions.
I love this
program
I think it's a commonsense fix
to through the
workforce issues
that we're seeing but
what are some of the strategies you're
using to
attract
high school age
young ladies to get in to
the trades
programs
in Santa Fe County
we're investing a lot of money in
the CTE program
through Rancho public
schools.
But I don't see the increase
of Grohl's
being.
Kind of directed to
these trade
so what is CNN
doing to recruit
young women into the
program.
I'm just be very broadly but I
also others may
so again I want to highlight
that I really
wanna appreciate and recognize
Dr Cleveland and the
school board for their commitment
to expanding
career technical education in
Sandoval county I think that's been a
long it's been a long time
coming to make such a
significant
investment
and you will
see you won't see it next
year and trace we'll see
it in the next 2 years is
that call centers
renovated for skilled trades
and I've seen them moves our
facility for main campus
for auto mechanic
diesel mechanic and electric
vehicle a program
to Sandoval County.
Now that will lead to more
expense eggs
high school students.
In the trades
and again be able to take advantage of
many more programs are currently
offered so I want to note that's
where we're headed.
And I'm sure that the
you have some comments and
my colleagues may as
well.
Sure thank
you
chairman Hamlin members of the
committee I'll just share a few
updates Erin
mentioned the Perkins federal
funding that we receive
one of the requirements of that funding
is to have secondary and
postsecondary
pathways and
so yesterday I believe you had a
presentation by Tory
shower child
with APS we
are continuing to
work with her and her
team to align those
pathways from APS
to see NM we do
other recruit recruiting
efforts we invite
schools to our college we
give towards we hold the
CTE date we have
open house we have
college day we
have incredible all reach
we offer community informational
sessions
so those are a few of the
other ways we're trying to
reach you high school
students and
we know there is
that.
Thank you for that.
11 of the
question.
John Representative if you don't mind I
think so
I if I could just jump in a
minute they've been very
modest so there's also
a program called generation
justice okay you and them
but there's discussions about
this and it's also important
that girls the that
only of themselves of these
work clothes but then they can also be
as beautiful as they want when they don't
wear so that that
shaped and
and public marketing is
also going on with girls in
high school so that they
will look upon this profession is
something that they really want to be
part of so they've been
very time but they
are being highly involved in
what's going
on.
In Madam chair
representative
so we're very involved in
partnership with C. N.
M. on the
women in the trade
summit
we are currently actively
recruiting women
of who were previously
incarcerated through crossroads
for women The New Mexico reentry
center
and we have
a women in the trades
council that
focuses on the extra
supports that women need
when they're in the traits
and and that peer
mentorship.
Thank you for that I I actually
love that you're reaching out
with crossroads
program.
You know because.
We want to make that
transition as smooth as
possible and it's
hard especially for women
to get released.
Find a solid
job.
You know with a criminal
record giving them
this opportunity gives them
that that
opportunity to just
go out on their own
so I think that's a great
idea my
my second question
of the P. what
bonding who
administers
that.
Madam chair representative
at the department of workforce
solutions.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you Representative Representative
Montoya I thank
you madam
chair.
My first question actually
have a couple of questions I could
for monsieur
Hartzler.
The.
Certificate programs
they're at the
chairwoman briefly mention
this about the opportunity
scholarship but also lottery
scholarship there there's
no.
Are all of the certificate programs
that are offered
in trades at
at your school and at the
other can
at the community colleges across the
state are are the certificate
programs all
of economic participate
in both of those scholarship
programs.
So I the so thank
you chairman and
Representative Montoya our
scholarship program are
so the option a scholarship
for funds
certificates and
degrees many
of our certificates in high demand
areas one are
stackable so
there is right so an individual
can or wants to get us
to the accounts for delivery but
we often know many of our students
particularly adult learners
step out go to
work they may come back
we want to make sure that the individuals
who are earning a certificate
frankly state in
perhaps work and learn at same time
because to make sure that they're
able to receive the fullest
budget I'd say the opportunity
scholarship in addition
to other funds that that are
available so
again the state funds legislative
lottery scholarship and the entry
scholarship there are many other
funds that are our students
get both 8 federal
institutional Aid and also
public funding through we and
some other funds for
some of our training programs that are not
only in our the college but
also are upskilling
programs
that are offered by ingenuity
since our square the one we're talking
about the need for funding we're
talking specifically an
advertising
for women and
traits okay but there
is no.
That the money is
there.
44
at New Mexico
student whether it's an
adult or a.
Somebody just leaving high school
to be able to get the
funding to pay for the
education.
Yes it
chair and representative
yes Sir we'll get funding
and if you look at the
average cost and you will see
the cost of attendance.
And that you may have at your seat
it shows Health
portable
I say all of our community college
tuitions are because
of the generous support of the
state directly to our
institutions but also because the
general aid available
again we want to make sure that our
students are
borrowing.
Closer to 80 percent of our students
graduate without any debt
right there really so
and it might be higher than that
so because of the opportunity
scholarship but I would just
note I think affordability
has is 6
is large our state
addressed.
There are number of resources that are
for that are helping to
get in the door it's helping to make
sure that we knock out all the other
barriers including the ones the
ones we may set up
unintentionally to make
sure that students can continue on
their journey pretty seamlessly
part of that building if they took
a job
that if
they were temporarily out of
school that they can return is that
sport or find a way to
continue.
Is is that what you're saying
yes and many of our
students I'm sorry about madam
chair and and Representative
and many of our students for our
they are returning
adult students a third
of our students already have degrees
hours have
earned credentials prior
to returning to
school so and I'm
sorry yes Madam
chair representative
and said I
8 I understand your
question was directed
towards the president
here
so there's
a few different educational
paths here
that the path I'm talking
about is solely
privately funded
a production yes madam
chair I have some questions for you at
the end about apprenticeships but
it's the amendment specifically asking
about the community colleges that we have
a big community college in San
Juan County that does this
so
there's a big increase you said and
and and roll meant
how job placement
for your
kids that are graduating
and what kind of
success.
I always wanted to but it's you
know I'd say more detail
than I do
so madam chair and
representative our students
on average
stay in the community over 8
percent of our students stay in the committee our
graduates are program complete our state
in our community
so placement in that sense is
high again our goal
is to make sure that 100
percent of our students have a
relevant work experience when
they are in their program and
what and the so they're employable when they get
out or that they do transfer
on 2 or 4 year colleges which
many do as they continue
to work so again it's
number 80 percent who stay in
this community or who
are transferring on
to
pursue their backside we
provide all across the state
with the certificate programs is
the the the the people
who participate state
their work there
live there very
big proponent
of of
promoting the traits I think this
is a the the
wages for
that cost of a
certificate of
the wages at the end of that
and and the entrepreneurs
that come out of that as well the
small business owners
plumbing welding
but as was mentioned
earlier
machining
these are these
are at this point
these are $0 a year job
these are economic based
jobs and we're
talking
many of them are in 18
months certificate
program so that so the
cost to the state
is. Is
not much and then they stay
here which and
they feel rules that the
state needs I I think
this is a great use of our
funds I just I did want to make sure
that that there was
no barrier for
that I do believe
there is one very that we've
created I
think it was mentioned earlier that
we we might create some barriers
ourselves I
think there is a very we've created
which is. We
used to have these
programs
in the high schools
and it was it was an
opportunity without
cost without extra
cost.
For kids in high
school to
see if they wanted to work with their
hands and really that's what
this is this is
people who want to work with their hands
not just their
brains and I think that's
a you kind of
pointed to that earlier but
it's a it's a combination
of the 2 it's how do I do
we have Raytheon
great corporation and
and San Juan County
on the Navajo
Nation.
And other once again
those jobs those are
$50000 a
year job does a terrific job
so but I
I think that's something madam chair that
that we should
look at I don't know why we took that
out of schools and it was
if we're gonna offer electives
why not offer electives
that give this path
and then it also gives
women gives girls the
opportunity to try this in high
school to see if it's
something. They
like and if we did in high schools
as well I think
there be less of
this.
Okay now a woman is looking
to come into a field dominated
by men I think if this happened in the
schools I I think that
takes that a lot of that barrier
way Representative
think in Hobbs though C.
tech is one
of those programs because it's so
close to these the high school
campus that there's really
that's something that we saw
last year
in the interim and I think that's
an incredible model of
of what's going on and and
connecting those 2 I agree
chair just I do have a couple
questions but the for
Joan
so
this is about the
apprenticeship.
Path
I I'm a product
of the apprenticeship protests
I work for a coal mine
hi in a very
specialized area of
explosives
and the only way you
learn that it's through apprenticeship
somebody else has to pass that on
so
once again I think
this is a great pass but I do have a
question in here
talking about challenges
in rural New Mexico.
Item for you
mentioned enforcement 20 state
enforcement
what are you referring
to.
So the construction industry
division has a
set of
regulations
on.
How things should be
built what
standards they need to
go to in
cold
as well as
staffing right
or licensing
like.
Somebody could
have
license adjournment
places to do carpentry
but they should not be touching
refrigeration.
You need to have a PA and
refrigeration license to
do that and so
making sure that not
that that the rules
in place are being
enforced and and
follow.
What does that have to
mentorship.
So
Enforcement goes
to the availability
of work
and expression
the rural New Mexico
so.
It Madam chair
representative.
I've been working on this for quite
some time being a
previous contractor
and running
into
what we call truck in the
truck
it's.
Somebody with no license
no bonding no insurance
they take cash so they don't
pay in their G. R.
tease
and if the work is not
available in those small
communities then
the company is
and the programs who are
investing in the work force
development
don't have the work and
they can't be competitive in that
market
so that
that is a huge thing especially
in rural New Mexico our
our lieutenant governor
has worked with me on this quite a
bit and he reached
out to me due
to a older gentleman in
there who would 0
hired a non licensed
contractor to do his
route and when the
lieutenant governor sent me
pictures of this
house I
wasn't concerned about Ruth
I was concerned the
fact that there was a
vent piping going
through an area that
created a fire hazard
so there was obviously
multiple on licensed in
code violations happening on this
house this has to go
with apprenticeship because if we
really want
especially in rural New
Mexico to
create the jobs
and the need
for those jobs
we have to address
enforcement and
make sure
Madam chair representative
that the available work
is there for concrete
companies so
madam chair and
and miss a
day
Baker.
I don't believe that we
there's any requirement
for.
General contractors
to build homes to
have an apprenticeship
program.
Madam chair representative
there is not a
requirement.
And.
So they
like AGC and
ABC both
do a lot of home
building
and they do have registered
apprenticeship programs
so.
We
have.
Did a lot
of. I'm sorry
madam chair representative
there there's residential
work there's commercial
work
either way and for some it
is lacking in
a very large
weight that it
is hurting
companies who are working
really hard to do the right
thing and make those
reinvestments into our
communities no a
partnership isn't
required but if those
companies.
Up that are doing that
and doing that workforce
development just
can't be competitive
because any old
body can no
I I don't disagree at all
with if you
have that this is this whole
underground economy that's been
created across the
state
I just I had
to meet you the list of
these is for.
Barriers and
I I just wasn't saying how
enforcement.
As a barrier and whatever degree there's
enforcement this is
needed this is supposed to be enforced
at the local level
if there's somebody out there are working
without a business license
that's a local issue if they're
working and they're not
licensed in the state then
that's a state issue
I I'm just I'm I
just saw the enforcement there
it didn't make sense to me I know that we passed
some legislation as last year
concerning some of the
other traits
and I wasn't sure if
if enforcement was related to
that but those
bills just now went into
law I can I could imagine that
enforcement would be an
issue.
4 days after 5
days after the laws going
into effect
so
one last question chair
and this is about the
apprenticeship programs
in some of the rural areas
or in the.
It's funny that Farmington is is
considered a metropolitan area but
we do consider ourselves
that we feel very
rural
but
in that state outside of the
Albuquerque metro
area
and Los crucis metro
area.
How are we
using.
Our community
colleges
and trade schools.
To administer.
Apprenticeship programs
for.
Companies that that
are now
required.
Temperature program.
Yes so madam chair
representative so San
Juan community college actually
has 3 programs that are
registered apprenticeships and
receive money through the apprenticeship
assistance act for
those.
I believe Santa Fe community
college has the early childhood
education
registered apprenticeship
CNN has a registered
apprenticeship
so
any community college
can go through
and submit their standards
and and utilize
their space we
have on
great relationships with
Luna community college
northern New Mexico community
college where we're actually
going in and consulting them
on how to build their traits
programs thank
you madam chair a misstatement ram
I'm gonna be very curious
going forward to
as to how we are.
Hoping that the legislature
pass legislation to help you with
enforcement going forward
thank you madam chair thank you representative
Representative Matthews the
representative Armstrong
Lujan room and then Senator
cakes grex
thank you madam chair
I think that I am probably
the only.
Legislators here
certainly maybe legislator
at all who
is my third major
career was as an instructor
in the business department at
C. N. M..
And so I I want to
start just by saying I
think it's just one
of our most incredible
organizations
in the state and
I'm sure other community
colleges
are important to
but this is the one I'm familiar
with and it just made
a huge difference in so many
lives having
said that and I'm gonna try
to ask a few tough
questions
my first question has to do
with what are
based on my experience
teaching in
the business department particularly
entrepreneurship which
was of course I taught
for a number of years
for
and in my mic
subtitle here is sort
of do we do
we silo things a little
bit and let
me explain what I'm talking
about
it was not
unusual for me
to have in my
entrepreneurship classes
of for example the
wife of
somebody
it is usually a wife not usually
husband of someone
who is in the H. fact
program for example
and she was in my
class to learn how to run
the business.
And there were many
times when I see and
then I had lots
of you
talked about the
culinary program but
there were lots of
people who were
coming into the
program
and they
would be taking the
whatever the skill
wise
courses and
then they were trying to
also figure out this whole
business side of it
and I felt
as I was teaching these
classes that
that.
It it
would be possible to
develop a more supportive
system for those 2
pieces of
creating a business
than we currently have because
it was really sort
of so separated
that it
didn't
it didn't mesh as well as I thought
it could so I I
share that with you
because I think that's a great
opportunity
and something
that CNM could
probably improve
on how
it structures so that it's
more
supported.
And this
the.
And the second part of
that is
I do tour recently of
a Ford dealership
which turned out to be far more
interesting than I ever thought it
would be and I got to drive a
$40000 Mustang
around
oxygen.
That's why we don't get paid we have
all the side
benefits.
Anyway
it one of the
things they reporting our the number
women they had a management
in for dealership
and and they were so
proud of the fact that for
example their
parts manager which is a
very important
position and those kinds
of businesses
of was a woman
and that she had tried
they were telling the story and I may
have some of the details wrong
but she had tried to come
over and at
least auditors
sit through some of the
auto mechanic
classes at
C. N. M. and was told
well you can't do
that unless you're
training to be an auto
mechanic and so
again I'm looking
at these I don't
know what to call auxiliary
professions
that are really good
jobs and
that need some
of the same kind of
speak background and
skills as
the auto mechanic for
example or the H. back
people
and I I
again I would just encourage
you to think about how
you can the community
college could be more
receptive to providing
that of
the 2 men and 2 women
but one of the jobs were held by
women
and we good
jobs well paying
jobs.
R. and and they were very valued
employees
this second
madam chair the second
question I'd like to
focus on
and our president
Hartzler kind
always hates it when I asked
this but
particularly when we're
talking she looks
scared.
Particularly particularly when
we're talking about
women in the
workforce and women
training we need to
talk about childcare
and.
I'm wondering I
it you and I have talked
about this before
about why doesn't C.
N. M. have on
site at its major campuses
some childcare facilities
you have early childhood
programs I would think you could even
do apprenticeships
with all of that
so I'm gonna let you
talk now for second about
that question.
Well I certainly don't hit
some madam chair and
Representative Matthews I don't hate that question
it's amazing I'm growing to
respond to that question
and as we speak about early
childhood I want to go back and say I really
appreciate
you you building on the
COVID that sometimes
we get our own way and I will
say one of the great efforts of the
state in the last decade is
to make sure that we are is
institutions are focused on
degrees and certificates and helping to
increase our educational attainment
to the point where we shut people out
for frankly
because they're curious
I'm. So
it so it's a really interesting dynamic
that it's like you know what in lesser degree
seeking students we have the
seats and
you know I hate pre audit
something so I appreciate our
focus sometimes gets in our
way of us
helping everybody achieve what they
want and and so
I I I had that
conversation with
a.
A full tenured professor at
Purdue wanted to take a brush
up math class who
clearly.
Have the skills and engineering to
be able to do that and we were
able to let him in because
he wasn't a degree seeking student
and I thought my goodness we have
really got to change what we do
so we are on
we're working on some of those
elements I really appreciate
you you raising
that.
I will say on the the point
about in
entrepreneurship.
When we talk about
businesses we know
that it's important for us to build
our we know what the
college support enough to
table the richness is there's a reason why we
have a division of workforce community
success because we
knew.
We have like 6
to 10 different efforts
including small business development
centers including entrepreneurship
programs
including what we have a we have
our xcelerated program
we have a hyperspace challenge we're
building up.
Businesses and support in the
space industry we have a
number of
efforts I
can't frankly keep track of them all
and why do we have so many and why don't
we hold them together to
say here's how we're going to help small
business we're gonna do it
in these 5 ways
and we're gonna let
others do a great
job on business development
whether it's west or
during spring or others
where we're than we're going to focus on
something different that they can't
do so I will
say that that 0 effort
those coming out of the pandemic
that in the workforce
development area that we are lining
those efforts.
Because again having a variety
doesn't help people quickly
takeover of Business
assume a business so
I know that we are.
I would say we don't really move as fast
as I would always like but I know that
we're working on making it simpler
because we want
individuals.
Just as they are learning
perhaps there and
gaining their high school or
high school equivalency or GED
as their learning a trade
we know those same individuals are in
the building is the same
times we want to make sure that those
skills at least
exposure to what it's like to
have a business plan and run a balance
sheet what that looks like
so I know that we're doing a better job
incorporating their learning
can always do better but I think we're in that
space and then we get to early
childhood education where we're
at
I'm excited that our new
school of education and
learning
it includes our
early childhood program and
so we are exploring the
conversation.
We we talk a lot higher ed
we are having this conversation.
With Santa Fe community college
about their partnership program and
about growing that
service we actually know that
housing and child care
based on the state's recent
data from their of basics you
need or the basic needs survey
around homelessness around food
and security child
care is right up there as well here that
for employers and I hear from our
learners. And
so I know that that's.
We are looking at ways that I know
Dr Nye re seals who is
our director of
enrollment and student
success is looking for
ways to use
are all state excess
space right now at some
of our campuses including
main campus to
provide I
was a drop in child care but
a way to help individuals who are
going to class who are taking
an exam to be able to do
that frankly people use
our library now or libraries
now for that service
frequently
but really trying to make it a little bit
safer for everybody including our
children who are on
campus in addition
to the
to building our lab
school
with are to be
operating in building a lab school
with explorer here in
Albuquerque
that will be able
with that will be a place we can
find.
Quality early child
care with
our student teachers are student
learners and many
of our students will be able to have
that child care at that
cited Explora so I'm
excited about our our partnership
with Brianti and I Bronte
and I think that will come
to fruition probably the next 2
years again not soon enough
for anybody I appreciate
that so we have to
we're making games where we can't
but but I appreciate the
conversation your focus
that you consistently raises other
members raise that with us
and and
I'm I'm proud that we're making
progress.
And there's so many more of us who
need to do that so again I appreciate the
legislature's support
for supporting early
childhood education for rate
work raising the wages
for individuals providing that care
because that's critical
matter how many schools I built or how
many day cares I built
if the wages are high it's not
going to work so I
appreciate that there are there are
many components to
answering that really
thorny
question.
Madam chair of
president are slower I
really appreciate that answer
and the fact that you really
are making some real progress in
that area and it looks like
that that
important support system
may be come to
fruition at
the community college
level and I think that would be
an incredible
benefit.
Just a couple more
questions
Representative I do want to go ahead
and point out there are
4 in front of you and I am going to
ask that we be
respectful of time in trying
to wrap this up by
11.
I would ask one more question
than of.
I do not till 8 I
don't really totally understand
the connection between the
apprenticeship program
and.
Of.
And C. N. M. and community
colleges and I I
I don't really have a question about
that but what I did want
to say
is I wanted to
underscore what
ms Baker said
which And
when I practice law I used to
do these kinds of cases and
as it as a legislator
I get calls not
just certainly not from rural
New Mexico is from Albuquerque
and that unlicensed
contractors and at
some point madam
chair I would
think that maybe this committee
should be looking at that
issue at C.
N. and C. ID and
what know what we can
do
to and as a
consumer protection matter
but also as an economic
development matter that
we require that
people required to be licensed
to do these important jobs
that we have a strong enforcement
piece of that
because this is a real
problem throughout the state
and it's an economic
development problem and it's a
consumer protection problem and the
losses on some of
these are in the hundreds of thousands
of dollars so with
that I will
madam chair.
Stop asking questions
thank you Representative appreciate
representative Armstrong and
Representative Lujan
Representative Rehm and then Senator
Griggs to she's off
thank you madam chair and thank you for The
presentation
first of all like to shout out to
Morgan who
was a small tools
mechanic
Nicole who is a heavy
equipment mechanic
and Schardin who is a commercial
HVAC HVAC
tech. That I
know of personally
and so shout out to them shut out
to you C. N. M. for trying to
recruit more women in the in the
trades and anyone
you know we're trying to grow the
trades in the state of New
Mexico basically flat
line.
One of the questions that I
have madam
chair is.
I was
curious.
On.
How the highway
contractors were exempt
from paying into P. want
to begin
with.
So Madam chair
representative
there was
a
federal law or
regulation
that did not
allow them
to
breeze.
To be able to pay and that
funding with the
bipartisan infrastructure
bill that restriction was
removed.
Thank you madam chair and
and thank you ma'am and
so I
believe that also part of
that that they were exempt because
of a deal that was made when
all of this was being set
up and so
one of the the the
comments that I want to make is
that.
You know things change
we we pass laws
we do things
and everyone thinks everything's
okay and then it comes back and and
it and it changes again and
so I just
want to to to make that statement the
other part of it is
I wondered.
How hard is it to register
an apprenticeship
program.
What's the process of
Madam chair representative
so
there's an application
process through department of
workforce solutions
where you outline your standards
and and you submit that
application
it's free to submit
the application and that
they have people over there who
can find technical
assistance in
submitting your
application
you have to have
from what I understand you have to
have registered apprentices
on the books for
one year before
you start receiving
apprenticeship assistants Act
funding I don't believe
it's the same for P. want
funding but
again those are special
apprentices that have so
many hours on public
works jobs that
qualify
in those 2 pots
so it is a it is a bit
of a process
but there is technical
assistance from workforce solutions
and they're they're great and then
thank you so much for that I
also I am
a little disappointed to see to
not C. H. U.
C. N. A. B. C. sitting at the
table along
with everyone else
because they are a huge
part in helping
grow the trades industry here in
the state in New Mexico
so just
if everyone would know that I
think that there's a lot of options
and I know for a
fact that one of
the those
entities it took them
almost 2 years
to have an apprenticeship
program
registered and so it
doesn't it's not as easy as
it sounds and so I just want
everyone to be aware of that
also when
when
home depot sells water
heaters.
How are you gonna control who's
installing that.
Stir Smith is going to go by
waters water heater at home
depot when he needs a water heater
and he thinks he can do it himself
he's not going to get a permit
so I don't know how that gets
controlled but
just just another little
statement there the
other part
of of the
issue of
miss of Joe
or Joan I'm
on the
the.
The legislative
recommendations.
To not take the lowest
bidder on public
works.
Is a real issue I
think that we would get into
preferential treatment.
I think that it would
be.
Something that is horrible
for the state of New Mexico.
And
I'm. Just
on a side note I'm really
curious how
did you know that that bid
was the $800
lower than the original
bid if it's a sealed
bid.
Of Madam chair representative
so
it was a micro purchase
therefore it was not
a sealed bid it
was under a
$10000
item the
information
was shared directly from
the municipality probably
not understanding rules
and regulations that they actually
should be following
and Madam chair
representative I'd like to somewhat
address the the lowest bidder
so I recommend from
lowest bidder to best value
the federal government actually
uses best
market value versus
lowest better
there are states such
as Oklahoma
of the
main.
And and others
that already use what's
called best value
procurement versus
lowest bidder there
are other best
practices
across the nation and
across the world
of the whole
country of Australia the whole
country of Canada use
best value procurement
and so I think that we can just
look at a better
strategy to to
invest our state dollars
thank you madam chair thank
you madam chair and and I
would agree that the best value
is always the best thing to
do.
But I still think that it would
be our
start some preferential
treatment and
unless that is
very
transparent.
I I really can't
support that but thank you thank
you madam chair.
Thank you Representative really quick
really quick madam chair
also we have a real issue in New
Mexico with these solar companies
that are coming into town I
get more calls on those and so I've
been talking to regulations and
licensing on how do
you. Get
the solar companies to follow the
rules and it is
also up to the consumer
to make sure that their contractor
whoever they hire is
licensed and
unfortunately we can't hold the hand
of every consumer in the state of New
Mexico thank you madam chair
thank you Representative and and
regarding the outside
of predatory solar companies
that's why I always encourage people to go
local and
to. Support
their local we have plenty
of solar companies that are
locally owned.
Thank you Representative
Lujan.
Thank you madam chair for that.
20 minutes yes Sir I'm gonna go
right into it and there's a lot
of things I can go into and
and you know so the laws that we
have in place and what we're having a
discussion and
really quickly to address the funding
I I see we've got the $3000000
I would ask I would say
to ask for some more because
you're basing it upon the form
50
and employees that we
apprenticeships that we already have
in place I would I would
recommend you go a little bit higher than
that just anticipate more
workers
the the thing that I really want to
kind of zone in here is we're
talking about disparity here that
has been mentioned and
that is
housing. And our
workforce housing and
we're creating all these jobs in
on these opportunities
and
what can you tell me what the average
pay is for trades or the
highest or maybe lowest
madam chair.
So Madam chair
representative
of course I currently
can really only speak to
my collective bargaining
agreement in my
wage
my wage tiers
but my journey men
make $43.07
an hour
which is
is much higher than the
state regular median
income almost
double so
this skilled trades and it
can it depends I mean electricians
are very high
rate
insulators are a little
lower than us but
almost every skill trade
pays well above
the state median income
entity time ensure where those
jobs are.
Madam chair representative
most of those jobs are
in Albuquerque
so this is Madam chair
representative this is one of the things
I was talking about with available
work so I
can recruit 3
students from
Silvercity
but I must explain to them
that they're
likely to have to go
to Albuquerque
Intel Rio Rancho
Facebook Los
Alamos
to to to
work I can tell my manager
were the fastest growing communities
are New Mexico.
Madam chair representative
I know that of when C.
County is a very
fast growing at Rio Rancho
is very fast
growing
those are 2 off the top of my
head Madam can you also tell
me what the price of housing
is in these areas.
Madam chair representative
at so I
live in told
me and
I could afford a house in
2019 thank heavens
I bought before
now
the housing
is
out of
control
I mean a 3 bedroom
home.
You're not going to get for
less than $400000
thank you to have a rents we train
and these
apprenticeships and
trades
workers after where
they go.
Are they staying in state I guess
to be
madam chair representative
so
right now we
have a lot
stay in state but
not not
everybody for
certain
if they're in a rural community
and they have to leave home to
work anyways the
main pick up a travel
card in
my you we have a travel
card and so they
might say well
and I traveled to California
instead
because they can't work
close to home anyway madam
chair representative
and so this
is that this is a huge challenge
when we're talking about the bipartisan
infrastructure law the inflation
reduction act in the chips Act
and all this need that we're gonna
needs for skilled
workforce because what could
happen if we we
at local for 12
and and the other friendships
don't get these people trained
were going to be bringing
in a work force from out of
state Madam chair representative
where the chance chair of us
actually doing that we can't
afford to house them
or pay for the
rent. Yeah
Madam chair representative I
think I really
appreciate you bringing up
housing in the other connectivity
issues such
as Representative Matthews
bringing up a
child care
much of our partnership
is in after
hours we're much not child
it not much child care is
available there's not
a whole lot of housing and
so
housing also relies
on the skilled trades and
construction industries
and if we aren't
having apprenticeships
in the residential
area unfortunately
we're going to continue to see the
shortage and my
last question and use in this
regard is what does that do to
our communities how we building our
communities how we building
wealth for a
generational help of wealth
and creating
livelihoods for
our state yeah
Madam chair representative I
think it's
that systemic inequality
and and I think that's what we're here
to talk about today is
that we have the haves and have
nots we have
programs in Albuquerque we
have work in
Albuquerque
and the access
that I was talking about in
the smaller rural in under
represented communities
there are some policy changes
that need to be made
and many of which I I
talked about here today
in order to start balancing
those scales and
ensuring
that we are seeing a better
distribution of of wealth
in underserved communities
with great paying
high
skilled
skilled trades jobs
and and the training is
the training is free.
Thank you madam chair and I
all in my question there but I
just want to make comment that you know I'm
from a a labor
family.
And historically and traditionally
labor
argue over unions are what kept our
families together and created
an affordability and a
generational wealth
were we
could.
We could work and live in the places
in our communities and
unfortunately and as we are
as I've broken this down
to the school line of questioning
that is not happening anymore
in order to your default is
to your
encouragement is
to you to me saying
thank you Charles you from even
being able to be a representative
here and my own count from
Santa Fe and
we don't have
the workforce there and we
can that is one of the most
expensive places to live
and I've been told by
friends and family to move to
California and cut moving
back that it's even
more expensive in other places in
New Mexico is you
know expensive and not that
expensive for families
and for the wealth and population that we
have it's not
affordable so we need to look at
that those solutions
that that that that would that level
of child care and
housing affordability thank you
Matt. Thank
you now we get to move our necks
over to this side of the room
so that we can get some
flexibility we have
Representative remained then Senator
Griggs will finish top yes
Representative thank you
madam chair and this
first question is for
C. N. M. can
you
tell me how
many APS
high school students
are attending your trade
classes
are you as
part of their high school
curriculum
and what classes they're
attending and kind of the
number of
them.
If you have that
data.
Madam chair and this
Representative I do not have that that
off the top of my head
but I can
certainly get that information for
you it there is no
question that we partner
with our with
APS
Albuquerque public schools we have
roughly 4003
to 4000 of
our.
25 plus 0 students
who are dual credit
students many
of those students are
in a skilled
trades
particularly with some of those
of charter schools
that are I see trades
focused and
I'd be glad to get you that information but I
don't have that information right
now. Madam chair
if you would supply that
to the committee we would appreciate
it and I'd like to know
what schools are coming
from thank you
then one of madam
chair my last question
deals with
the unlicensed
contractor how
many investigators
does.
Does the state have
to investigate
unlicensed
contractors.
Madam chair representative
I do not have that
information
I definitely know it's
not and it's not enough
they don't have
people dedicated just
for that and for cemex
so
they have the state
inspectors
and state inspectors
which we already don't have enough to
to go see
the things that actually pulled
licenses and
permits
so we definitely don't
have enough
again in my
recommendations I want to see
construction industries division
requires a
request the proper
budget to
get an off and to actually
have people
who solely focused on
enforcement Madam chair
representative.
Madam chair
this is the
problem they don't
have the investigators
if you go to a regulation
licensing
up they
don't have investigators
for many
of the different licenses
that are required.
And the legislature
should be looking at
funding
investigators for
that I'm actually a
licensed private
investigator
if you look in the phone book you
can find
security companies
that are listed that
part licensed
with New Mexico I mean it
would be very hard
to to
investigate or prepare
that case but
thank you.
Thank you Representative learn something new
every day.
Licensed private investigator
now I do know that as we
have Senator Griggs will finish off
today there
are probably some things that you
that will occur to you that you'll
want to follow up
and that the committee has requested
and I appreciate you providing that
information you'll send that
to Erin and then Erin will send that
to the rest of the committee so I have a
feeling with some of the questions that have been
asked today
you'll have that as well so Senator
bricks and is
down to you
Mr.
Thank you madam chair in Yemen
try not to ask too many
questions I was going to make some
show comments because I
know we were in our
Ford kind of rush at the
moment but I'm I'm
proud of you guys
for
working with women
to get more women
trade.
And I'm I'm just thankful that we're
getting more people in
trade because ultimately
we're gonna we're gonna
faced those challenges
down the road so we we
need to we
need to do that but
for the for the
college one of the
things that I think gets
left out
when you do when
we
train people
for trait
which is a lot of these
guys when they get they get out of
school they want to go to work for
somebody but then they want to start
their own based.
And we
don't give
them a basic
understanding
of business skills
or just who he
hired me
who handles your books what
do you what do you do and
I think it would be important
to have that
as just it didn't have to
be super
detailed but it needs
to be there
so when they get out
whenever they move down
the road.
They're gonna at least know
that they need to go see
somebody. The
cares Act
listen how many
people
do you know that you've
met that started their
own business and
failed.
Because they
didn't reporter
she or just want to
work they didn't they
didn't do their workman's comp I
mean how many individual
actual show
you want to be sure that they
understand how to do that
up. We
talk sometimes about
like build like go
that trades in
school is something that should
New.
And when I was in
school course we had auto mechanics
we have a lot else
but in in
1971
in Alamogordo my
dad. She
started a building
trades program and
Alamogordo that mo
or into
a vocational education
program and in
Alamogordo back in
1971
these guys they get out there and they
build a house
every year
and some of the challenges
with that stuff goes
how do you ensure.
The the kids
out on the job site what would
you do and show there's there's
things we need to work around
but those give
us give those guys you know
you can be in the classroom
welding you could be in the
classroom putting
together
hi.
But out on the job site to
different the and it's
important I think that they have
the opportunity to
to see
that.
You representative Armstrong
hit on some
some things about
your the apprentice program
and and stuff in
your I don't know
when Alamogordo if we have
hardly anybody that she got
into your registered
or whatever we call it
apprentice program but I
know
almost every plumbing
shop every
elektrische and they have
helpers and
those helpers are basically
apprentices because
they're learning how to
do that particular
job and then
ultimately
if they want to be
a licensed
electrician
madam chair I guess the
delays you take the test
and you become
licensed to
our. To be
able to do whatever
show on I'm not
sure
that we're actually
you know absent
qualified people
even though we don't
have.
Qualified people in
apprentice programs
and so we need to look
at is it too much
of a challenge
you need to to
difficult and
I don't know whether it is or it isn't
but I just.
I would have to
imagine that
either these guys or or
non union shops
for the judicial they
just don't want to go
through the hassle
to set up an
apprentice program
and they would just train
their helpers
to become
plumbers electricians
or whatever it might
be.
Well you know we ran through a
lot on this
particular on the
staff we we
were talking about the procurement
coat there real
issues with the procurement
co and is far
as lowest bidder
Representative Armstrong absolutely
right the low bid
has got to be a
major part
of any short
of.
Process because
we're.
We're allocating the
taxpayer
money.
To show more.
And.
It's got to be it's
got to be part
when when you look
at certain things were schools
have been built and and other
stuff happened
they've had.
3 qualifications
one of the most price
one of them was the experience
of the contractor
and the other one was
presentation.
Now let's laugh at that for
then it because it didn't have
anything to do with
building the building.
Or doing some of that
stuff. So
what I think
everybody in this room in this
room everybody at that
table we need to
work on page
3 right process
for the state of New Mexico the
use in
procurement
for construction
primarily and if it needs to
be different for
Roach in
different for
ray.
Buildings how you set
that up we need to
debate that we need to talk
about it because
it's the taxpayer
dollar that we're
spending and we're
either we do spend
it wisely or
we're not
in.
I know what had and that
my friends in Alamogordo
come talk to me about
buildings built in
hobs.
Not gonna talk about Los crucis
madam chair of them talk about how
are permitted
were that the cost
of the building which
$2000000
higher than
his
bit.
No one in that
deal.
$2000000 more so
those are those are real
issues that exist and
we just need to figure out
madam chair how do we how do we
do with that image
all of you guys
at the table working
together to come up with
a with a
solution
Representative Rehm in the
and the unlicensed
contractors.
The underground economy is alive
and well it's always going to be
there.
One of the things emissions let's
let's even step away from that
permanent let's
talk about
within.
President trump was elected
he wanted to bring jobs
back to America.
That was one of his things that he
talked about age lots of
presidential talk about
that.
Challenge with bring in a whole
bunch of jobs back to
America and America
building these products
instead of the
Taiwanese or
Japanese or whoever
might be.
The price goes up.
Sure you have these 58
among the consumers
and manufacturers
we want to have these good
paying manufacturing
jobs but we won't
pay much for
when when Representative
Armstrong talks about
Brian water heater
at home depot
and install
an 8 year shelf
possibly
you know that show we because we
don't want to pay somebody
else to do it because
it cost efficient
and we're cheat
everything 1 of which we don't
want to pay any more than we have
to and and
so those
are those are things we
getting we got to get right
now
and.
And we can't sometimes and
maybe we can I don't know
we can't pay
top dollar.
And expect
everybody
to warn.
To pay that price
we can't just talk dollar get
everybody want to pay that
price.
Yeah we can't quite
honestly
good and bad work
with unlicensed
contractors because
I'm license guys
can do pretty good work
of a lot of them have
been licensed in the past
in the. They
decided when they need good part
time now they can't they won't
do it full time and they
want to just let you handle cash
and you can can be happy and
they can be happy
we have a challenge statewide
with code enforcement
in each and every
community we live
in.
The state of New
Mexico wants to be
the has
in the past wanted to be the
overall comment for
for.
And.
Arguably that doesn't
work.
But we need to look at how
those things are
done
show if we
want to
koju force in Las
Cruces and Alamogordo
that we can have some
Representative. They
did it we can have
Alamogordo be able to go to
Los crucis in Los crucis
be able to go to Alamogordo
if Alamogordo select
Christian inspector
is out
for down
we we need to be
able to do some of that stuff
and we have for
whatever
reason.
The state and
the community usually
can't seem to figure
out what that right approach
is we need to
find.
Because we're lacking
enforcement we're
lacking making
sure that
you're protected by
somebody who is licensed
in your in your community
show.
I don't know which you know I would
need to I just making
notes as we went along about
out everybody comments
and concerns that they've got
and.
I think we're on the right
track education
one but I certainly
believe that you can
add some things which may
be beneficial
to the students who were
instructed
because they're going to be important
to all of which.
And I look
forward to
to she and what comes
out of some of the
stuff
figures.
We had presentations
yesterday and this
is a good one today and then
what we talk about realtors
and we I. But
to you guys thank you
for being here thank you
Mr.
Madam chair
Senator I I
appreciate all that and I
think I just want to hit
quick like 40
seconds on 3 of your
points one
of them is the the
item that went to $0
over the original bid happens
because a change orders change
orders happened because
the lowest bidder takes out
pieces of the scope the other
contractors did not
so best value
you just gave me a great
example as to why best
value is better at limits
change orders because the scope
for scope apples for apples
are evaluated
Madam chair Senators
I also
understand that good to get into
the construction industry there are
multiple career pathways
and I have always been a
strong
probe.
Advocate for
supporting all of the pathways
is the post secondary education
the registered apprenticeship
and of there
is a partnership that is
considered non registered
and that is that is
accepted but how do we
ensure that we uphold standards
as well when we consider
it
education workforce development
and then finally madam chair
representative
in regards to somebody
installing their own
water heater or non
licensed person doing it
it is not inspected or
permitted and a
homeowner's insurance if
that water heater blows up or
leaks will deny
their claim which is
one of the reasons why
I say that we need
a public service
announcement to let
homeowners and consumers
know the risks
that they take when they
do this if they don't put the
team P. line at the
right angle
that that water
heater is actually an
explosive in it if it
explodes inside their
house and was not
inspected
and permitted their
homeowner's insurance will deny
any claim thank you madam
chair Senator.
Thank you so much I have to think about
of kind of my point pride
and how I insist on installing
my own dishwasher clothes washer
now I know I will
never install a water
heater or tankless water heater
for that very reason
so I do appreciate
that ladies
thank you so much there was a
quick question and and I hope
that there's maybe just for now
the way that do is there any
way to leverage the
money that you get for federal
funding are there things ID
like I don't know if the unions
can do but maybe the community colleges
can do.
I think when you talk
about so we talk about
Perkins
funding.
Yes we can leverage funds will
be glad to look at ways we
leverage funds C. N.
M. I think is known for through
our partnerships
leveraging institutional
state and federal funds
for programming and for
capital
it would without a doubt it's one
of our it's just who we are
so we always look at that
well thank you so much ladies for being
here and for all the work that you're
doing and very
exciting as as I I
warned you and I Warner next panel
and thank you panel for for
sitting around and and we seem to be
running like a little bit about 30 minutes
over civil will keep that
in mind in future
scheduling but thank you ladies
for being here Preciado all that you're
doing that and that we
appreciate all the work that you're
doing in terms of our communities thank
you.
Are our
next.
The panel
is and I'm really
curious about this in terms
of.
Real estate
and.
What's the challenges
are that this community is is
experiencing real estate
development.
Because we're talking about housing
for talking about affordable housing
we're talking about availability of
housing for employees and
workers and communities and
so we'll have
that X. that the
conversation next
we have Rhiannon
Samuel who's the executive
director of the New Mexico
chapter
of and A. I.
O. P.
which is a research foundation
correct or is a
nonprofit.
Okay and then we have to
be Burke who's the associate my
present vice president of state
local affairs of NAIOP
and then more the show to as a lobbyist
and by the way Marla thank you very much for
helping coordinate
our state here to at C. N.
M. for this meeting so
thank you very much so we're
gonna let you go at
it and and give us
the the
rundown.
There we
go.
That.
Chair Hamlin members of the
committee thank you very much more
shots again registered lobbyists
for now New
Mexico and
that may opposite
commercial real estate development
industry association
we serve developers
owners investors in
commercial real
estate professionals throughout
New Mexico thank
you for allowing us to update
the economic in rural development
policy committee on our
perspective how the commercial
real estate development process
is working in our state
I members are comprised of
all the professionals who are
responsible for the bill
community including
bankers architects
subcontractors
developers engineers
planners and everything in
between are so
ciation is eager to
continue advocating for
a streamlined permitting
process which will
foster economic
development while
maintaining the balance
of environmental
protections.
To date now New
Mexico's executive
director and the New Mexico
chapter of NAIOP
is New Mexico native
Rhiannon Samuel we
will highlight some of our
key initiatives
that we are promoting to
improve
our competitive standing
in attracting business and
economic development to New
Mexico also
presenting today's Toby
Burke associate
vice president of state and
local affairs for
now so we will
highlight what permitting
reforms are
trending nationally and
regionally
lastly Naot New
Mexico would like to thank
the legislature for keeping
permit reform and
streamlining a focus
throughout New Mexico
we want to be part of the
solution and keep
collaboration alive
so we can attract
a thriving population to
move to New Mexico
and keep our children from
leaving the state to start their
futures elsewhere
with that I'd like to turn to
and Samuels who is going
to discuss our initiatives
here in New
Mexico.
I think
I got it thank you chair
Hamlin thank you for the invitation
thank you more love for
helping
facilitate this we're really excited
to talk to all of you about what
the challenges and bottlenecks
are to
development in New Mexico
and they op
I think of it as a proper down
but again it's the commercial
real estate development
association and
while many of our members are the
folks who are building multi
family mixed use
industrial and office
properties are board
also has many home
builders on it which are a
vital piece of this
conversation as
already discussed in the previous
panel
something that I'm often
asked why isn't
New Mexico getting the
level of of development
or activity that
our peer states are
Texas Arizona
called Colorado
all of them seem to have
more going on
and when you travel
there it just seems denser
more vibrant more people
walking why
is that not the case
here and don't get me wrong
I absolutely adore
this state I think we have
so much to offer I
love hiking around the
state I love
traveling
but I can't help but also
wonder why
can't we have that level of
activity that they
have because not only
does that help the people who live
here it helps people
who are
visiting here have more things
to do and it also
helps us have a broader
tax base that we
can invest in
ourselves that much more
and so some of the
challenges and bottlenecks
that we're currently
experiencing or
just the sheer
amount of time
it takes to develop in New
Mexico
as an example
we've been working very
well with the local state
agency the DOT
district here the engineer
Justin Gibson is
wonderful to work
with but he
said it was not
any surprise
to him when. My members
told me and I shared with him
it's taking about 8
months for an approval
from his staff in one
of the most dense areas of
the state we're seeing
some of the most activity
some of the other corresponding
issues are
local issues which I
fully understand that you don't
have any purview over
but they complement one
another so while the
City of Albuquerque has D.
O. T. taking first
position on
all approvals and permitting
that they have to do
if D. O. T. is taking 8
months that is 8
months we cannot be going through
the same process with the City of
Albuquerque now we're
working with the city to perhaps
do things concurrently or
in parallel and
they're very receptive
but the fact remains it's
taking a long time
for the state to get things
out the door now
compare that to other states
that are members do business
and if it's only taking
them 3 months from
concept to implementation
are breaking ground and
for us it's
8 months to even get an approval
let alone breaking round which
realistically looks like
18 when salt
when everything is said and done
we've got a problem
in one of my members as it
pretty well
that. What
he says capital
will follow the path of
least resistance
I hear from him every single
day because he's one of our
member companies that is
locally homegrown
but when it takes
them 3 times the amount of
time 3 times
the amount of time working
effort here to
do some work in New Mexico
he's gonna take his capital
elsewhere
so there are certainly
things that we can be doing as a
state to incentivize
that growth in that investment
in ourselves and making sure that our
local companies can do
so I think it's
also important to note
that
we're most of our events
here are here in Albuquerque
our member companies are
based mostly out of
Albuquerque but we are the
ones that are also doing work in
all of your rural communities
Goro is a great example of
it there's hotels
that are being built by our members
things that are being re have even
that are historic buildings and we
want to preserve because that's
always going to be the best option
for us to preserve what we have in
place and
it's less of an economic
or an environmental
impact on that
community
and so in those instances
where we are in rural New Mexico in
your guises next neck of the
woods we are going
through construction
industries division that's the
idea right that's what it stands
for because they don't have
home rule where they have their own
planners reviewers
or anything like that and
that's where you're going to be able to step
in today and we're we're hoping we can
offer you some solutions
what can you do at the state
level to expedite
your process to show
that there's predictability
transparency and efficiency
at all levels so
that way when somebody wants
to invest in ourselves or
do business or develop
here they know what they're
getting into now
if it's gonna take
3 months 6 months
accolade in the state the 9
months as long as it's
defined we can
work with what's predictable
but the unpredictability is
what's killing us and killing
our opportunities to
keep money here in New.
Echo so
that is really the importance
of streamlining to the
development
and the economic
implications which I think you all
can arrive at on your
own that means
proud of the companies that
want to come here are
probably going to want to to somewhere
else for their big chain
because they can define
how long it's going to take on the amount
of collateral the steps
and process these they're gonna have to
go through we
don't even have that
in the state of New Mexico
so I think we have a lot of opportunity
there and later on in our
presentation I'll share
specific examples of
where I think we can we
can.
Perhaps not legislate
our way out of it this issue although
that is a solution but
perhaps just change the culture
to be more welcoming
and being more supportive
of our own to invest
in ourselves with that I
will toss it over to my
colleague Toby he's
with me op national and
you can share what's going on in other
states.
Thank you just Senator
him Hamlin
chairman thank you for the opportunity come
visit with you today
like to provide you with a little bit of
background and perspective of
what some other states are doing
in this area and
really is to bring
advantis said more
predictability
consistencies to the process
so again when someone is
developing a project here in the state they
know what the process is and
and what the details
of our to that
in the state of Texas in
2019 they've
passed legislation
called the shot clock
respectively and
basically it provided
a
every local government within the
state at once
the application was
submitted they had
30 days to
make a determination on
that
application
if not it automatically
was approved they
could also up to 3 times
ask for additional information
so that would extend the 30 day
would restart that 30 day
shot clock
there was some challenges with
that and
the challenge was really there was no
mechanism to
enforce the measure after the 30
P. they period
last so this
past session the
past HB 14
which in theory
would reduce that
amount from 30 days to 15
days and after
the 15 day period with
the ability for
additional information
they could go to a certified
licensed third party for
approval and so
that's how that we've approached it
in Texas
we also are very active in
the state of North
Carolina
it is was introduced
last year it was passed the
house on a bipartisan
basis a
79
to 33 an
opposition and
basically in North Carolina
the legislation would
establish a 21 day
period for the
local permanent
entity to
make a determination on
a completed
application if a
dish. Law information was
required
and once they receive that additional
information they would have an additional
15 days to make a
determination
on that
request and again
different states will set different
time frames and I'm not
here to suggest what it should be here
in New Mexico
I'm just giving you perspective
of what some of these other states
have done
and
it also
it also we leases
the locality from any
liability associated
with that permit that is
issued under
the legislation as well
I think that's an important
point to make in
addition
once the local
permanent the TV sees
a
certified
permit approval from a third
party they have 3
business days from which to
issue the permit and
so just to give it would try to
give again we're trying to get predictability
certainty to the process
and provide a time
frame because when is managing
the many these projects they
don't just start when you get the permit
there's a lot of issues that go into
it from the
financing and of
it from
retaining contractors
important insurance
from getting the resources just
to break start breaking ground
so there's a lot of elements that
extend past this
point and
so it actually passed
the house this
year it was
105
to 11
so the only Levin in
opposition yes they were
all Democrats
but also 33 Democrats
voted for it so I think if
there's a very reflected very
bipartisan approach to
this it's
really is mimicked after
a Georgia which I just want to briefly
mention because it's slightly
different the
sponsor did take the George
legislation modified it to
fit what occurs
in North
Carolina but in Georgia
though we spent
3 session 6 years
in moving this
discussion through the
legislative process
and finally we got to.
The 6 year and
we've been working with the Georgia
municipal league who have
concerns and we sat
down with them we actually at the
end they were supportive
of it and in the state of
Georgia it
establishes the
requirement the locality
a Coast the
requirements for what it
is items need to be
in a completed
application it
includes what the processes
the stage is that it goes
through a creek creek
also includes
a
fee calculator
so you know what the
perspective of what the fee will
be and once
the the look local permitting
anti in the state of Georgia receives
that they have 5
days from which to tell the
applicant whether it's complete or
not. And if it's
not then you have to provide the additional
information and go through it
then a 30 day period
starts if the locality
is not able to do it
you're able to go to a third
party for
certification of that
approval that.
A permit
application
if you do go through a
third party the
locality keeps half
the fee for
the permanent and the other half
goes to the third
party
but that's how they've done it in Georgia
as well
I also wanted to provide you
because it is a very important issue
for our industry and and for
commercial and residential
development is is obtaining
that permit to to begin
the project so
I also have provided you with
our research foundation
he's conduct they've conducted
a study a similar
to what I mentioned a moment
ago it looks that
transparency
what a you know what does the
locality post
online again of what is
required to have a
permit to
completed
what the fee is and things of that
nature it also
includes accountability what
steps to localities
take
to move that process for do
they have enough staff
to meet the demand
do they find other alternatives
such as third
party.
Going to a third party if if
needed in fort
is is really
consistency
what steps to the take
to a fact
of the permit moving
forward and that
case in in the in the case
here that's highlighted in the
the document that it provided
you
looks at Georgetown
Texas which
includes a
K.
manager to
help shepherd and manage
that
permanent patients through the
process and so that's
why they got a high high ranking
and and and work noted in the
document as well
it's 100 localities
that we looked at
it is
very
objective it is not
subject Chubb that
subjective it
really is looking at the
local permitting ordinance
looking at what's on their website
with their time frames are
it is not objective
all it was not us
going to any of our members are
developers and asking them what they
thought it was purely
a objective
by the numbers academic
exercise and that's
what the other documents
included just for background
for you all as well
so
chairman thank you very much and
will protect
your.
So.
To highlight some of the things
you may have heard
in what Toby has
shared I'm gonna just break it
down pretty succinctly and what
we think would be successful
for the state and a great
example as again
the state influencing
local decisions but then in
coordination with one
another the all of
them are lists are and
outlined in this letter you should have
received
but to take it off
the utilization of third party
vendors we
understand that the
state is
struggling to hire folks
just like our industry
and this is a great
opportunity to
ease the burden on state
employees by
using licensed
third party reviewers
to look application submit
a report back to them
and send the state can have
more information that saves them
time energy
resources
I had heard some concerns
before that it
may
be like some sort of pay to
play situation or
favoritism
but the fact remains that if
somebody's stamping something
they put their license on it
they are going to do it with the utmost
integrity at the risk
of losing their license
so we know that third party
vendors work elsewhere
and we believe that they can work
here as well
the next is establishing
turnaround times for
permit and approval
approved an
application
approvals
we've seen it where
it's 3 days it's
30 days there's
any scenario
in which this can work out
we don't have anything
so we can start
somewhere let's just say
90 days let's say
something
and we can make we
that would be better than what we've
got
I will say that there was a bill that
was introduced by Representative
Castellano and Representative
Sanchez
last session and
it was overly broad
it said it looks to
any state
agency that does like.
Syncing and asks
them to declare how
long it takes them and do an
annual report out to the
provided to a
legislative body
that went as far
as hunting licenses
to drivers licenses
and it was just
introduced too late in the
session we didn't do our
due diligence ahead of time to make
sure it had those Pat pit
bulls but we think it has
an opportunity for revival
going forward
just being more targeted
towards the development
side of things
we like to that as an
opportunity and allowing
state agencies to declare
how long it's taking first
because again we
understand state employees are
strapped for time
put to put a mandate
immediately upon
maybe not well
received and so we were
trying to figure out what's a good
middle ground
if you choose to do
anymore time frame that
is your prerogative but
we want to make sure that we're reasonable
partners in this
too.
I'm pre application
review teams
so I don't know how many
of you have ever gone through the
permitting process with the
state or the city
I know I haven't but I've been
told by my
members it
is an
interesting a
needle to thread
because are you being really
like clever and saying
interesting.
Yes I am being a bit
clever. Just
checking.
I'll say it's perhaps more
challenging and very
nuanced because
sometimes you don't know you need
certain permits for certain
things you don't know the
right person to go through
in certain departments the
same can be said in the
state and so by
having these teams
be there and
say here's all
the things that you need to
set yourself up for success
think it's folks on the right
foot and again
it's it's having more of a
customer servicemen
ality to
let's see this opportunity
and growth happen here
in that same breath in that same
vein having perhaps a
project in budgets men or
navigator
so let's say
after you have your pre
application review team you know
all the things you need to have
done this person would
be your advocate within
state government to
shepherd your projects
through the
process this
came through with the
City of Albuquerque we thought was
helpful because they also have
their interesting
things about them
but also
the fact that
it the that it's
tough for the reviewers themselves
who perhaps our engineers
to have to deal with the
review and then the
customer service side of
things that takes
a special person to deal
with some calling you every day
trying to figure out what the status
is and then get through
your workload
this could help
them. And
then finally leveraging
the op as a resource
Marla had mentioned at the top
of our remarks our
membership is extremely
broad yes
we have developers proper in
our membership but I also
have planners
bankers architects
engineers
brokers nearly
every business
industry is represented
in our name in our
membership and Eileen
on them constantly
because chances are I
don't have the answer but I
know someone who does and
I can get that to you
in any regards to business
or development so
everyone of you should have gotten one of my
business cards you can
scan that QR code on
it and asked me right to your
cell phone I text
all the time I email all
the time I'm a digital natal
native as a millennial
so I'm hyper
accessible and I'm happy
to help
you.
With that let's talk
about implementation
strategies and
challenges
iready foreshadowed
one of them the bill that
we help we introduced
last session
with Representative Castellano
and Representative Sanchez
for 19 that's an
opportunity that's a vehicle
to get things done at least
having some sort
of definition
however Marla
is working with Representative
Dixon to perhaps
go about getting that information on
how long it's taking in a different
way now let you share.
Thank you.
Chair.
We are
asking.
Legislative finance
committee Representative
Dixon is for a
directive to get some
of that information so that we
can get a better
understanding
again from the agencies
the departments some
of our
concern is they may not know
how long their turn
around time is we
found as we've been
working with some of our local
agencies that if
we work in collaboration
and and they start to
understand what they're
turnaround time is
we can also come in and say
okay what can we
do to make
things to streamline that on our
side so we are
working currently
on getting that
information to
LFC
to start that
process with
Representative
Dixon.
Sure Hamlin with great then maybe
just make one comment as well in this
and the challenges of a
execution and implementation because
that is a big challenge at the state
level and
I'll just referenced the state
of California
recently govern
New some
leasing executive board and
approach towards
streamlining infrastructure
projects and
projects and I had to write this down
environmental leadership
development
projects related
to those projects
whether it's retail commercial
residential
that our
lead cold
are projects
that are over $100000000
at high they pay high
on paying
jobs
they get an expedited process
through the
state legislative permitting
processes
it goes into a number of different areas
and trains streamlining
import infrastructure projects
whether it's roads utility
lines water
infrastructure but I
think it's interesting because
I understand the complexity of
it and I met read the
report and very often in
includes establishing the
strike teams
and the strike teams are intended
to work between the
agencies that have multiple
disciplines in these areas
to help coordinate that and
manage that process
and through all of that
the governor mentioned that
they could reduce the time on some
of the projects by 3 years
which is a fairly
significant amount of time and
that's kind of the approach a
taken he needed
legislation just 2 days
ago we reported some of the
streamlining legislation reform
legislations which
passed the the assembly
there in California sent to the
governor so.
Thank you.
I have a few more thoughts before I turn
it over to Marla to
close for us
but addressing
your development process
concerns are the concerns that
the industry is facing
is a rural economic
development initiative
where you're going to see these
roads built the infrastructure
I think of Los Lunas and having
the data centers out there
that's in the hearts
that didn't historically have
investment so
by leading the charge in setting
the example for the state
by implementing the strategies
I think that you will I
know that you were
welcome companies and show that
the state is
leading with
action
additionally as we're
facing a housing crisis
something else that New York is working
on we have to
thoughtfully consider
what are the barriers in place
to putting more houses on the
market if
they're in these rural
communities that have to go through
C. ID if it's taking
too long
why would a home builder goes
there what's
incentivizing them to
help add to the supply
which the private sector
is eager to do
so and to help be part of the
solution.
It is also important as you
consider the implementation
of the bill that better
and we have so much money for
infrastructure.
It's all for not if we can't get
the money out the door you see
it all the time with your
capital outlay
you allocate the money
how long does it take to like
it's done for
ever I know LFC
is still studying that and I'm sure
you still are calling
on the state to
state Hey I put money
aside for this what's happening
these are some of the challenges
that they're facing to at the
state level.
And then this will also
help with our
growth in
New Mexico of course because will welcome
it but we need to
think about in
migration
our population growth was
nearly stagnant right
with the last segment the US
Census I came out
we are not growing like our peer
states part of the
reason is because we don't
have the job opportunities
which this industry
provides we don't have
the houses we don't
have the amenities that others
do like the
entertainment toward
day cares all these things
that development half of
that development
requires our hopes lend
itself to and it's
because the process is getting
in the way and becoming a
major barrier
so because of that
again it being a major
barrier thank you
for listening I know that this
is a
very
at it might not be as
exciting as your other
topics you
probably don't see the
process the developers have
to go through but it
is something that spurs
all the other things that you're
interested in growing the
trades wealth we
love to employ them
if we had this jobs
to employ them
and house them all
of these things I really
feel that it comes back to
development and what we
doing to welcome it so
thank you more let let you
close yes
that.
Forgetting that chairman
members of the committee I just
want to thank you for allowing us
to speak today about
some of the best practices
that we would like to incorporate
into the state
how we can streamline
development so that we can address
many of these
issues that Rhiannon
has just raised
we have a very strong
commitment to
development in the state
but also the
balance of
making sure that we're taking care of
our environment
and all the in
particularly that sometimes
comes with that so
with that we stand for questions
thank you.
Thank you so much and you know I think
this is indicative of
the conversations that we've been
having in the so
far in this committee but also what
we have coming up
is.
You know I I look at us as
the legislature's kind of a board of
directors and
I've I've I've mentioned this
before in that we've got
all these different groups and agencies
and organizations who are doing
things in the state that
we don't have the capacity to
do but
our responsibilities to help
support them and when we
when we continue to put up
roadblocks or we
don't have things to
where it's practical for the
industry
that we're we're doing a
disservice to those different
areas of development
and and and
progress in our state
and so I'm I'm grateful for this
we talked about housing of
employees were going to
be some of those conversations
are going to continue but as I've mentioned
about the spoke of the wheel
and how whenever we talk about something
they're all these different elements and what we're
finding is there overlapping
and they all relate and so
grateful for the conversation and
the thing that frustrates me the most
is when we we continue to
put up your credit
roadblocks
that I
will be a little bit more Frank because you're
being a lot more diplomatic and
I have very little
diplomacy when it comes to stuff
like this is like that
that we're we're really
making ourselves walk through
my and taking
you along with it.
And so I appreciate
those efforts and I and I
I'm I'm grateful for those
conversations in the continuation
of those relationships
and presents Marlins always at our
committee meetings and really grateful
for that and and
so we do have a
committee that has
there couple folks we have Representative
Matthews Representative Lujan
Senator Tallman
Representative
little.
Senator
Lopez.
Senator you Mr because we're talking
about some of the the hotel tax
the hotel and mall renovation
tax that might actually part of this
conversation
so I think
I'll bring it up for you since you were
Europe is doing something
but I figured that this might be just because this
is along those lines of the conversation
we brought up yes you Senator
X. about
that about
making it a little bit like the
hotels that were in Alamogordo
and really helping that and
so we've got Representative Herndon
anybody
else.
All right Representative
Matthews.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you presenters.
I just had some
clarifications if you don't
mind I hope these are kind of simple
questions
but
what kind of projects are we
talking about we're we're not
are we talking about an individual
seeking of
a permit to build a home
are we talking about
subdivisions.
And it was a scope of
what you all
are talking
about here.
It's quite broad I'm not
necessarily the individual
having a home although that would be
impacted by this
most of my folks are doing master
planned developments whether it's
housing mixed use
or other things
additionally we have
solar companies within our
membership who have found
that the permitting process is
near impossible
despite all of the state's
focus on efforts to incentivize
the industry.
Thank you and then I'm
sure that that's an interesting
answer about the solar
companies that's very
interesting.
Are you suggesting
that there are no
time periods
established by government
in the state
for approval
of these plans.
Chair Hamlin Representative
Matthews not to
our knowledge perhaps there's
something going around internally
but nothing has been posted that
says here's how much
time you can expect
the closest we can get to it is
somebody who submits an
application will
then perhaps
get on the phone with someone from that
department and they can give a
rough estimate but nothing
is clear or predictable about
that.
Madam chair
Rhiannon.
It Albuquerque
is a home rule city
and I'm just curious
is it in some
kind of a different
status in
terms of this issue
than the
non home rule
cities and.
Governmental entities in the
state chair
Hamlin Representative Matthews
great question.
Wrecked Albuquerque is a home rule
and so what that means
when it comes to zoning
or individual
approvals whether it be
hydrology
or
goodness some of their
traffic engineering
it's done in house
however they still must
work with state agencies
like DOT if a
project is within a mile
radius of where
it's going to be so that's where
the state comes into play
additionally we have another
commenting agency
what the water utility
authority that's a Albuquerque
Bernalillo county
hybrid
so they still
have touch points with
the state but
where are folks are also
seeing just primarily the
state input on their
projects are in rural
New Mexico which is why we're before
you today because they
must go through construction
industries division in
our LD to get their
approvals.
Thank you Rhiannon and madam
chair.
I just wanna be sure I'm
understanding what you're suggesting
is basically what you're suggesting
is a
state.
The wall
that
establishes time
limits for
the processing
of.
Permit. Building
plans approval
building plants right
permitting.
And that
then would establish it on some
kind of a statewide basis
and are you
thinking that
it would be the same time
limit for
every area of the state every
size project I mean do
you have some.
Fleshing out of what
something like this might look
like.
I'll talk to you either if you
want to okay
taken.
Okay I just want to make sure
my other panelists didn't want to take the
question chair Hamlin Representative
Matthews
W. would you like to.
So I'm
we're not suggesting
necessarily a time line
even right now as mentioned
in house bill 419
that was introduced this past session
it was just clarity
on how long it's
taking I think once
we can establish how
long each agency or
each.
Apartment is taking
then we can figure out what is a
realistic timeline
perhaps its statewide
perhaps it's
area based although
I would imagine that being
challenging to drafting
legislation but you all
are the experts not
me.
All it takes I will
say in a place the country we
aren't looking at a
time frame at the state
level we're
we focus more at the
local level establishing
timings at the local level
then have a license 30
certified we certainly
would like to see better
coordination with local
entities and local divisions of
government and districts
and also with the federal government
because they
probably play a role in the state
as much as a lot of states
in this area no
maybe you know improving
coordination would also be I think
assistance as well but
we have an you know with other
states ask for the
state lotus that time frame
our time frame again is at the local
level.
For that.
Madam
chair.
The.
It seems to me that if you're waiting
for a study to see how long it's
taking.
That we're gonna be looking at
legislation
several years from
now actuates damaging
a time limit and
I'm wondering.
If that's the most efficient way to
proceed but more than
that I'm sort of
thinking.
And I don't know how other states do
this but I would assume that
we could
set some kind of an outside
time limit was some ability
to extend
that under appropriate
circumstances and get this
thing. I mean if
this is as critical as you're
suggesting
that waiting
for a study
for.
The New Mexico it seems
to me that the maybe
slowing down the
caboose a little bit
here
and then my madam
chair my and
when work but 2 more questions
certified third party
could you give an example
of.
What kind of a
entity or
individual would
be who.
To whom it would be delegated
the authority to approve
the
plants.
Chair Hanley.
We in other states are looking
at those
engineers and architects
that are certified and
licensed within the state
that meet all the qualifications
that we now they're
not associated they would be associate
with our projects
the maybe certified with Act
locality it's only
a conflict of interest so would be an
independent third party
and I will say in in some
local jurisdiction I was just looking
at the the city of Richmond
Virginia we
do have third party
certification of
inspections and
apartments and I was
visiting their inspection websites in
on there's page
they said if we cannot to
inspect your property within 2
days a list for
different
independent farms
or services to call
to go to in place of
one of the city inspectors
that has contracted
with the city
so.
Madam chair
of.
Do you have an estimate
of the cost
to the localities
and to the state
if we were to
impose
or enact a
requirement that required
the permitting to look
occur within.
I mean you were talking at
1.15 days 30
days I mean that's it's ME
is pretty quick
on a major project
but any anyway do you have
any kind of
estimate of the cost to
the state and or the
localities
to expedite the
process.
No I I don't see
mia chair Hamlin
members of any
we do not have a cost as many
again the time frame is
for the state to decide
what is appropriate I'm not here
to advocate shorter
longer you know
with ever is in agreement
with you know in speaking with localities
and that they think they can do it as
well I
will say and only speaking
with some of our members
in North
Carolina you know you
could take out Raleigh
Charlotte and
Greensboro triad
area blue in the restive States pretty
world and they were telling
me a lot of the the counties
in rural areas
already contract with
licensed third parties because they
don't have qualified individuals
within those counties
to do the to to
prove Department and
so that's you know
again an alternative
for them which
then in Jerry's also
save them a little bit of money from
having to hire
staff person.
Madam chair at have you
all had any conversation
with our L. date about
how they might feel about
this.
Chair Hamlin Representative
Matthews yes we
have.
It was last year it
wasn't recent
but it. Didn't
go much further than that
first conversation
although they were we're
really grateful that they were receptive to
a meeting and we brought home builders
involved too
I think some of their has it most of
their hesitation is where around there
staffing challenges
and if
forced to have a tight
turnaround time how
that would impact
the morale of their staff or if they
could even keep up
they also were
considering how large of the
state we have and if they
do send inspectors
out
how long that takes and how
much manpower
that take so they
had some of their own
concerns but.
We're it's an ongoing
conversation.
Madam chair and presenters I'm
just curious it it need for
see that this is a more
complicated issue than
legalizing marijuana
or.
You don't really have to answer that
question correct
it will stand
up.
Thank you for
your for your information
thank you madam chair thank
you Representative Lujan and
then Senator Tom and Representative
little Senator
Lopez Representative
turned in and Senator Griggs
thank you madam chairman I'm gonna keep
on the same vein of of what
Representative
Matthews was was going
for it kind of just getting to the
efficiency in the big picture of
everything you're doing which is a big
picture conversation
so what is your working relationship
and and this conversation directly
with the governor's office as
she these are her
agencies so let's
cut to the chase I'm
sure. Madam
chair members of the committee
we have been doing
outreach
to a number of
of her
agencies
R. L. DEC
IDE D. O.
T. we
are beginning those
conversations
with the governor's office
as we have begun those
conversations with the
legislature legislators
and how we can proceed
forward so all
of those are just in
the beginning the process
just as we are now
also trying to get
distracted directive
from LFC so it's
an ongoing we consider a
parallel track
it is it may not be
received.
It is well
as it could because it
is a stressor
it is going to be perceived as a
stressor for the agencies
and the departments but
at the same time
there's a stressor occurring
around the state with the
lack of development
so we are
engaging in every
level that we need to
to get the support and
collaboration to
try to solve some of these
issues yes
I mean I commend you and all that but I
think that the directive here
is to.
To work both with
the well
first of all the governor's office as
these are her agencies
as we know chichi regular you
know.
Cabinets under her
jurisdiction so
I would I would like to know more
about that and how those conversations
are going and where we are how
we are and she's working with the
Legislature I guess you know
you're working with Representative
Dixon and LESC what they're just gonna
give you information and what
is already known right
and you already have that information
from this conversation
of 8 months or more
no on those sorts of things
it's it's quite quite a bit
no so I think
that. I
really am appreciative
that you're taking a responsible
approach to what you're doing working
with environmental
and the
use of buildings
and and such I'd like to see more of
that have more information from you
and how you're doing that
because as
the cost is gone up for
a construction and everything
else I think that that is very
responsible so thank you for
for showcasing that with us
today.
And look you know we are this is
about the barriers in development
and and process and I I think
you're really on top of that and I think this
is really really important
conversation
and leading with action I think
this the stops this is
in your arm
the governor's office and
provided branches
working together alongside
with you to really put this together
and look at some policy and how we do
that so my next question
as what is the bill number
from from California
or was that an executive decision
you mentioned but wasn't effective
decision and little
I got an email yesterday from
California business properties
association they
gave me a link to the site that
had all the bills there
are like 6 of
them
and I can send that
to tomorrow
or Erin
and she can find that link
to where it is on their website because of
the whole and I'll send a link as
well to Care
Act madam
chair
service
and I
will do that again
also.
The executive order.
Ashley said governor data
may.
Thank you and I I do
I
do.
I do appreciate that and I I am thank
you madam chair would like to get that information
on those bills and what they've been
doing there I think that that
is that is a a
place we can work from as
far as like what is it was been
doing you know I
mean I'm looking at your list here there's
2 counties in New
Mexico that major list
MFA County into Indiana
county
I have some other questions about the opt
off.
Off the set after
you're done with the pandemic
but.
When you're talking about
construction us you mentioned
utility lines
as part of an issue can you
can you. Talk a little
bit more about that manager.
Last year.
What I'm talking about
that.
Madam chair representative
when I was talking about the utilities
what California's doing it is
part of the series
of legislation that
Legislature enacted
on Wednesday on
a given an analysis of of
those bills.
Okay so thank you madam chair so do you
think in within looking
at how we are partnering
together that we
need a facilitative
office to
really manage all these
different agencies as long as
well as local government federal
government madam chair and does any
of that exist or was
that
demonstrated in any of this
legislation other
states.
Chair Hamlin Representative
Lujan it's not
an legislation are in
other states but as mentioned in
our letter we were
interested in having either a
pre application review team
and or
project navigator because
we've seen that work very well
with the City of Albuquerque and we
know we can apply
it at the state
level
whether or not it's a whole
office
I'm.
I'm unsure if you need
that many
folks
perhaps it's a single person
but it to shepherd's
applications
through.
Madam chair representative
I will say I spoke to
our lobbyists in
Ohio because they've been very
active and they have jobs
Ohio whose role is
to help and assist companies
in navigating the state
system
not only permitting but also
the resources
that are available I
also was looking
at Arizona because I know they are very
close to New
Mexico
and they actually are developing
a portal and it's a
dashboard that will
help companies navigate with
apartments apartments are
for whatever their project
is
it's still a coming
soon so I
think there's probably still working out
the.
The resources that are going into it in
any technological glitches
but it's the website is up and
running issues
could has message coming
soon and I can certainly
send that to current as well which
would like thank you madam
chair thank yet just navigating
our own procurement
code there are
there are different levels of it right there
different.
Application.
Parts of it so to speak by
business type of business impact
type and what the need is for
that procurement
so for us to do
to look at some kind of legislation
late legislation like that for
reforms actually something
would be I would think would be very
useful and I just want to last comment
on the capital outlay reform
I can't.
Say enough about the
waste of money that we have in
the state due to capital outlay
projects that are incomplete
and means for $0
plus right so if
we can look at and read the
address that how that reform
looks in
initiating and
are incentivizing
what the the federal funding
that we have right now you can't miss
we've heard over and over the
IRA
as well as other the
infrastructure
money that could come to our state
in our state is really
poised for this type
of funding and we are
not.
We are not there yet
in that the reform for capital
outlay and I think that we need to
prioritize that and I think we need
to really work together
along with the governor's office
and and looking at how we
do that and I think we've had
a number of of policies
of. But before
so look at how we can do that but we
really haven't
invested in that and often I
think that we are in
a very poise position if
we do not move on this
this is this of
billions of dollars that are going
to waste it yet again so
thank you madam chair appreciate the
time thank you for your work
poorly. Thank you
Representative Lujan senator Tom
and then Representative little and
Senator love this.
Thank you madam chair
and thank you panel for being
here.
So.
This chart
top 100 ranked
100.
Cities as far
as.
As the speed
of permitting is that
correct so we
rank a number 3500
what's so bad about
that.
Madam chair
Senator
I will know town
this we measure
transparency
accountability and consistency
and with a weighted score
they set of 120
so when you look at the
weighted overall score
it was 40 want to add a
which again you just
a score of 34
percent which
and most schools is not
a passing grade and
so that just putting in
perspective what you're reading it's not
so much the rank
as it is
the the percentage thank you
now move on from that would end
as far put a plug in for city
management form a government.
I highlighted every
city in the southwest
that is doing better than
we.
Everyone of except
under. The
city manager form of government
so that put a plug in for
city manager form of government
which study after
study shows
cities with that form of government
are more efficient.
So is this
is permitting would you see
classify that as your biggest
problem madam
chair. I
don't.
Chair Hamblen senator Clemente
yes permitting in the process
to get through permitting
or the timeline to get through the process
welcome to disagree with the more you
go I wish that was your
biggest problem because it's a profit
probably easy to stop
you know your organization and
several other economic go on we're
getting they bring in experts
over here to
say why is
Albuquerque this one of the
slowest growing
depositors southwest
and they all have the same feat
given for reasons high
crime poor
schools not
enough skilled workforce
and poor leadership.
So. How
can you say that.
This is your biggest problem
what if there's a
lot.
We could have the.
The fastest person
process permit processing
system in the country
and they're still not going to come here before
the reason I just gave
you.
Madam chair and senator
Tom and I don't disagree with
you those challenges around
crime and education
are certainly barriers
to attracting business
however I think it's important to note
that nay this the commercial real estate
development association
and while all
those things impact our
business we have partner
organizations that work
on those issues directly with
you and what we were asked
to do today was talk about the permitting
process and so
I could talk about crime and education
with you all day but I
think it's more beneficial for you to
show for us to share
our expertise on the
development side of things
so agree
but.
I don't know if madam chair would like
us to go off on that
trail
today.
Okay so we can avoid
the problem
so.
Joseph of senators of
artists whose probably.
On the fourth smartest
persons in the Senate stood
up.
This year is
set.
And said New Mexico
doesn't like change
and we don't take risk.
Well you show me a state or a
city or county that doesn't take
risks and that's like chains are probably
not doing very well it's
just a comment I'm glad you brought
up capital outlay
is according to governing
magazine the second we're system
in the country every year
I've faster legislation
to change that.
And if you think I've got any
made any progress should be
wrong. This
year I sponsored a bill with
the rules they
said Senator common we
realize we got a problem we
appreciate all your work
and in a table it's
a horrible
system.
And
as
Representative Lujan pointed out we
got $4000000000
sitting there on spent
why because.
Yes for 0 Bucks you get
$100000 the first year
is such that the 0
sits there.
For years
it's not no
state does that this is just
is just laughable
almost it's so bad.
So if you had a different system we
wouldn't have $4000000000
we might have a 0.$5000000000
sitting there but you wouldn't have
$4000000000 sitting
there and then also
I'm glad you brought up about
amenities.
That's another reason
why.
It's the frosting on the cake for these
kids that we.
My son is a good
example.
His wife went to law
school in Phoenix did want
to come back because
she. They liked all
that stuff you can do
in Phoenix a lot of a lot
more stuff more
recreational
cultural.
And the educational
opportunities.
And so I'm the big
proponent of building
a.
I did some research I can't
find another metropolitan area
in the country that doesn't
have the has
1000000 more people we have 1000000
more people within 50 miles of downtown
Albuquerque that doesn't
have a modern multipurpose
arena. We
can't count the pet because
it's single purpose should.
Thank you is a barn that was
65 years ago you would take
out of town guests to.
And the thing they build on the middle of
nowhere Rio Rancho.
Is undersized only 8000
I gonna get big name
entertainment.
And so you can
well anyway that would.
If you had something a facility
like that we would be able
to to
have a lot more amenities
that would keep
people
here. So
that's my.
Thank you for listening sounds
like you agree with
me.
That's all I have
chairman thank you
thank you senator Tom
and Representative little and then
Senator Lopez Representative
turned and Senator
creeks.
Thank you madam chair so
good to be back with all of
you.
I am
I represent the northwest
corner of the City of
Albuquerque and Bernalillo
county and
one of the issues that
being faced right
now is the
development in the
surrounding area of petroglyph
national monument to may be aware
of that and so
in the state money and
like New Mexico New Mexico
is quite unique
but we do have
the historical and
cultural.
Locations and sites
that are discovered
sometimes known
about most often that
are discovered as construction
and groundbreaking takes
place.
So my question is
about
would introduction
to you have and the reason I'll get
to my well let
me put up
front is that
often when those issues come
up either on a cultural
historical site that's and
covered their
I'm very
aware of
a tribes coming
into registered
their concern about
development in those areas
and those must be
considered in the
state of New Mexico
and it much in the greater southwest
and probably the
country
those issues are faced but how
you deal with them especially
since we have such
a.
Of large
current indigenous population
of which I am I
I am come for the publicists
amply penthouse.
And so my question
is.
How is there
an introduction
to this area for
real estate agents and
agents and developers
those in the
industry
about what happens and I'm
not talking specifically
to those federal
lands that have been identified
but those that surround
them at such as
the area around the
petroglyphs where we're
now dealing with the
city and land at the
zoning and planning
department or dealing with
to concerns
being raised about heights
requirements about
expansions
and so on
in
in a way
that's being presented
as a way to deal with the housing
crisis
and
I live in that area I'm
not in the
petroglyph area those are
quite expensive
homes and that's not
in my mind affordable housing
for many people
but that's how it's being presented
so my issue that
was a side note
but I'm wondering.
How do you
introduce
what is in
place to introduce people
in the industry to
the issues of cultural and
sacred sites such as
that and
how finding
them.
Actually can do late
approach a project moving
forward that's a very real
issue and
often when
these concerns are raised
by indigenous
court
entities
there's a backlash
against them and it comes out we
don't want to be pitting people
against each other but
what can we do what is being
done to introduce them
to these
issues.
Chair Hamlin Representative
little so
being a representative in
Albuquerque then you're probably well
familiar with the integrated
development ordinance which
is the one that is dealing with the
few protection overlay that you
referenced also
known as the PO
Albuquerque has one of the most
robust community
engagement
process sees that
require far
reaching
outreach to neighborhoods
and protected groups
indigenous folk of the in
indigenous peoples as
well I a
great example of our latest
collaboration with
folks from the indigenous
community is with the
housing forward plan on me
up was a partner with mayor
Keller to pass
that legislation or that ordinance
are the changes to the
zoning and
they were in
consultation with native
American groups
throughout trying to figure out
what are the needs within that
community how is it impacting
of certain areas like
the petroglyphs
and that's where your zoning
changes are and we
are
compelled to follow
what is happened within
zoning however I'll say
that many of my members go above and
beyond to do outreach
because they want to make sure that
what they're developing
is community responsive
so they want to make sure that
if it's housing the houses are
purchased if it's multi family
it is least and that
includes engaging with the
community early
and often and my members
do
that.
Thank you madam chair thank you
madam
at one of the things that we
discovered is that
in in this issue was
that the formal level of
consultation with tribes was
not.
Conducted in the fashion that
it should have been so there still
may be some missing gaps and
I don't want to speak on this
too
any.
There's some information that I'm
I'm not aware of it all of the
pieces that are
are were involved
but my my
concern is because
it's not just in this site
but recall
that many years ago the Santa
Fe convention center was
also discovered to be
sitting on top of tribal
lands a at
old historical
sites so
that delayed progress
and I think as we on
no now it was resolved
but I'm just wondering as a
team it's good to
know that you're
that those in your industry and
real estate are
going beyond
just
the.
The checking boxes
to make sure things can happen
but reaching out to different
communities but I'd
encourage
I'd encourage that to continue
to be a very strong
part of the
working with the Ford of
development moving forward because
nobody wants to see delays
no not I don't no
one does and those
challenges that can be
avoided I would hope
would be avoided by that
especially conversations so
thank you madam chair
thank you very
much.
Thank you Representative Senator
Lopez.
I thank you madam chair and some of
my questions have
been indirectly asked by some
of our previous
questioners colleagues
but I what I wanted to mention is to
say I appreciate the
presentation
and I I believe over the
years we have seen
help processes need to
be approved
and I believe that
especially when we look at the state
level how we can
work with our own ideas
Representative Matthews did mention
just to see what we can do to help
streamline the process
is and madam chair
I believe even with the prior
discussion I'm talking about
inspectors I
believe that the state really needs
to look as to how we can
invest and
encouraged out your construction
industries division really
needs work has
for a long time
and I think COVID kinda
had
another.
Added to the problem
but I think that's just
area that doesn't
affect just there's a
greater hi in larger
communities that effects everybody
statewide cell
I just want to mention that thank you
madam chair thank you Senator
Lopez Representative
turned and then Senator Griggs
if we can shoot for finishing
this up at 1230.
All right.
My quest thank you madam chair
members of the panel might my
question is very simple
looking at what may have does
and and what we might need within
this state
we talked before with
the trades people
about individuals who are
in the trades they come in here they
really don't have anywhere to
stay so my
question is would you
all be invested
in trying to put together
this housing developments
and a lack of another word
that would focus on this
those people who are transient
coming in to do skill
work and then they would be
leaving and
the and that's also
would go for professionals who are
coming in looking for housing
and they need a place to stay
we really need to address that
so I'm looking for your answer
to my question Madam
chair of
presenters.
Chair Hamlin Representative
Hernan thank you for the question
as already mentioned nap
was of very key
piece with the mayor's housing
forward plan a few pieces
that I think are relevant to what you're
asking about that
were amended out
are seizing the building
height restrictions for multi
family so if folks
are transient in nature for
the purpose of a job multi
family is often times
their best option
but something that did pass that
we are excited about is
what they're calling motel
conversions but truthfully
if it extends beyond
that and what it should actually
be called is adaptive
reuse so
business office
properties or motels and
hotels that
are not in their highest and best
use what this did was
allow private sector money
to come in and
be able to
renovate and do tenant improvements
for people to live there
it is a lesser kitchen requirement
they do have their own
bathroom they have their own
sinks both bathroom and
kitchen but
the less requirement is an
induction stove as a pro
opposed to a proper
gas stove and so I
think that may be a possible
solution to your specific
scenario but
we are eagerly involved
in trying to solve this housing
crisis along with many others
like the home builders association
but I think it we all
need to be cautious
and thinking about homes
as a singular thing
and a singular family
home we need to work
on the full spectrum
of housing from
section 8 and low income
to the higher income single
family homes because as we
attract businesses here
oftentimes those
executives will not be
going into these multi family
units were building out but
would like that higher in
product and we in
talking with residential
realtors we don't
have it and
we know that if by
increasing the housing supply
again across the entire
spectrum people will
graduate either up
or go down on.
Where they're feeling right in their life
so if somebody has already
raised their family in a red
in retirement age may
choose to go
into
a multi family kind of
situation or if it's
somebody who is out of college
in a an apartment
now and then once a
single family home we
have to make sure there's options
for everyone and
we're very much part of that
conversation I want to be part of
the solution.
Thank you madam chair thank you for the
results yes.
Madam chair.
Representative maybe make one comment
because you mentioned that the reviews
and that something at the federal
level we are pushing
at for tax
incentive for conversion of
under utilized properties
nap is at the forefront of that debate
in DC and I've been
talking to many of
our
chapters and
and states
that about replicating
that program at the state and
local level because when I
look at opportunities
owns
in many states they've been under
utilized and high
was one of those states a to pick
on Ohio but they developed a
state program that mimic that
federal program
and opportunities most successful
state I seen
to utilize opportunities and
to return some of these fighting
areas to productive economic
use again and so we
are having a discussion about adaptive
re use informal
housing
as well and
something to consider maybe at the state
level things that are similar
program to assist and
conversion of the some of these properties
to productive use again and
housing.
Thank you that's a great idea
thank you madam chair thank you
representative senator grace finishes
up.
Thank you madam chair and thank you guys
for for being here when you
when you selected
your
pillars
and you selected to
consistency is being
the most important
because it's the it's the
most heavily
weighted
did you actually run any of
this
if you change
the weighting
factors to
where
shade
transparency
would have been
more
heavily weighted
because I would I would think
possibly on this
stuff for different
developers.
The different pillar
might be more important
to them you know if
you're coming in madam chair
to to the community and you're
just going to be in that
community maybe.
Want you know it's
possible condition she's
not all that
important to you
but no one we're
the project share
at which your
transparency
pillar
might be might be more
important show
a community like Albuquerque
might do
better.
If the evaluation criteria
which weighted
differently
a community like
Dona Ana County I don't
know if anybody lives in Dona ana
county
might be better
off without I don't know it's no
way to do it it's not doing
to get on your deal but I've
I want to I want to
defend down for just a
minute
because most
counties.
Don't have
Prosch issues
like this
the the state
handle
most county
inspections and
approval
not to County
themselves.
And if each in the E. T.
J. exposure toward
your restriction
often needs a mix
of county and
city show
you when you when you look
at them
I thank you be
it it probably better not
to even look at all
until you knew
exactly what was what
was what and how they
how they might have stayed in
the cares when we're
talking in the last
the we're talking about
inspections and code
enforcement and
those sort of things.
And some of the issues right
here the
cares.
When a project
being the
house or be
a commercial project
would come to a
shady they
would bring the plans they would
bring everything in delay
amount and they're going to
evaluate.
Some of those cities
don't have code
enforcement.
Any longer or
have never had a
shave Alamogordo had its
own code enforcement for
years until
the state felt like
they do in like certain things
that Alamogordo was trying to
do and so they
felt like what we need to pressure
Alamogordo.
To quit doing the H.
owned code
enforcement
we don't want them usually
international building code
we want to use the
modification code that
the state had we
don't want to let them
have a inspector
come over from Los
crucis
to fill in if Alamogordo
is inspectors or go
on of
their. There's
things in the in the
process
the need to be
understood.
Maybe even before you bring
your rank a
community in
the way but
I I understand
what you're doing because you need to
have something.
But.
We need to be consistent
in New Mexico on what
we want
as forage
Enforcement and
processors in
each community don't they we
don't need to be different
we needed it.
When you come to Shadian al
in New Mexico
you know that this is going to be
processed for
valuation and
if we wanted to be just the
state of al Ewing
stuff. The
we need to decide that but I
I kind of doubt that's what we
want.
But it's it's interesting
I I appreciate what
what you've
done
IBM.
How are we to talk more
my colleague shared Coleman
about capital outlay
because or some things about
that that we're gonna be
we different on
but.
This is this is a good
start I
think that I think
you'll need to need to
look at some show more
detail for
dapps
because it
stands when you when you have
this if you're not
sure of what some of these
other is.
You may be doing
Dona Ana County
additional research
by having them in there
and they may be
actually way
more responsive
to a developer then
disappears for them
to be shown
thank you madam chair and thank
all of you.
Thank you senator.
Madam chair.
Senator I will say
with this report
it is very objective
in the sense that
we didn't have any and
I'm on on the legislative policy
side we were totally separate
from and there was a firewall between
us there was a firewall
between talking to
developers about what should
go into this because they
really wanted to be in
an academic exercise and
what was done with a professor
at George Mason University
so I just put that in
context yes it's
slightly
above
transparency and
see receiving a transparency
accountability
you know 35
to.
Up to 40 percent
so I know are
are a.
Chief of the lead person
on this is in
discussions with our chapter to
make a visit out here and I'm
sure she would invite you to attend
his presentation
given that detail for you
so chair thank you
madam madam chair and and
usually you guys know if we waited
2 things differently it's
quite possible I could have
a higher rating
with conservation
voters of New Mexico and
then Senator Hamlin that
but we
don't do
that.
Thank you all for your time committee
thank you for your thoughtful questions
and participation we appreciate
that thank you for staying a
little bit longer than
expected
and we
I I do appreciate it
mention this to the vice
chair
thank you for being very clear one of the
things we always are wondering is when
when when you come
to us then we ask you to present
to us is like what is it that you need
us to do. And
I appreciate your clarity and
very directors that you're like these
are the things because
as I mentioned about kind
of being like a board of directors it's
like we.
We have all have interests
certain degrees of interest in
what all of our committee presentations
are but obviously
we're not all incredible
experts like we're asking
you to be and and to come
here and talk to us so
thank you very much for the
inside and the conversation
and if you have any
other things that pop
up that you'd like to make sure
that the committee gets you're
certainly welcome to share those with Erin
and she will share this with the
committee.
Thank you all for your service
to the state.
All right committee so we have
lunch is available across the
way again a big thank you
to our crew here at seeing it
C. N. M. for being
wonderful hosts for
us this afternoon we will
finish off this
week this month of
of meetings with
understanding how to accommodate
employees with disabilities
and and then we will
adjourn for the
month and then I'll
give a little bit of a preview of what's coming
up in August
so we will
recess
until
our next panel supposed to begin at
1:00 we'll push
it a little bit to about
115
well let's say 1:00 you've
got 40 minutes I think that's decent
enough time now.
All right so let's recessed until
one lunches across the hall
thank you very much.
