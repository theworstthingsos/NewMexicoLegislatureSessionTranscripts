things that we ways we can
partner
and so I Representative Armstrong
I'm gonna talk with you afterwards
because the
the thing that we were talking about in
Sapporo I want to try and
bring that up in a caucus
meeting soon and
so we are starting off
first on an update on New
Mexico's cannabis
industry
we when the
legislation was brought in
a couple of years ago we
knew that that was something that had to
be addressed every year
because the initial
provided an was not
perfect but we knew
that we wanted to go ahead and start
working on that and making sure
that our communities
were able to thrive in
that we were
also able to stop criminalizing
people for less than 2
ounces of possession
and every year we keep
addressing that either be water
issues or licensing issues which
I think are things we're gonna be talking
about. Today in
in the upcoming session
and so we have Todd Stephens
who is the director of the cannabis control
division the regulation
licensing department
welcome you've
been on the job for how
long.
Thank you madam chair committee
members of 47
days I believe so right
on camping right on
okay we also have
been Lewin Jr who's executive
director of the New Mexico Canada chamber
of commerce full transparency Ben and
I've worked on other projects
together in terms of
public lands but I also
am very grateful
for

what he's doing for
the cannabis industry Dylan gross

task ending cannabis company
and Tony Martinez
but we've also
got.
Yes madam chair
committee members this is Nick morning
he's my compliance manager
I wanted to bring him along as we buy
really ramped up for compliance
initiative to recently
fantastic
so we are going to just
let you do your
thing and
when the committee as questions will go
ahead and open that up but I'll let you
all I do that I do
want to not cut what
you're going to say short but just
will recognize the
time that we're on so we'll
let you go ahead and go first.
Thank you madam chair committee members thank
you for having us today it's
always a great opportunity to
to speak in front of you folks and
get a chance to answer questions
especially about the emerging cannabis
industry
in the presentation
we kind of mention our mission there
to kind of help with time I
won't read that word for word I
think we're all right
there.
But truly our mission is to
to to serve on the mac
New Mexicans.
Ensure health and safety that we're
complying
ensuring compliant businesses and
really working with community
members
shareholders
to formulate the best plan going
forward for cannabis in New
Mexico our
largest job is just to enforce
compliance
and ensure these folks get the fair
business practices that they deserve
as well so
kind of moving on to the next
page
that priorities for for the
division currently
when I took over I really wanted to
focus on a few things number
1 compliance if we have a
compliant industry in a
compliant market
a lot of these
challenges that other industries
face
or other state to face kind of
88 early
be aided
so really ramping up our
compliance initiatives
working with my
team and we'll give
an update in that and just a few
moments
protection of public health and safety
again making sure that New Mexicans
are getting quality cannabis
products we
find that is very important
keeps the industry safe and I think again
it is part of why we have legalization
to ensure that this is safe
tested products for New Mexican
citizens
fair business practices
again
this cannabis industry
unlike a lot of other states
are created lower very of
entries we have folks
at the cannabis industry
table that would not have a
seat in other states
and I'm really proud to be
part of that it's very
exciting because folks are getting
literally to chase their dream
of doing this
and then last is limited to removing
the illicit market from New
Mexico
this is probably the largest
challenge that all
legal cannabis states
faced a matter how
mature
we can't haven't figured out a
way to keep folks from
breaking the law I think that that
people are going to do that regardless
it's our job to really help
provide those illicit actors
work with good faith
actors and really
limit the amount of illicit
drugs and illicit actors that are
in the cannabis
industry and make it
difficult for them to
thrive and
exist.
Moving on to the next
page.
We can look at some sales data to
give you folks an idea of how well
the cannabis market is
doing
so between April
first twenty twenty two which is the
day that we launched
legalization for first legal
sale to September
30 we've
had more than 700000000
in adult use and medical cannabis
combined that's a massive
revenue and industry
that breaks it down there just over
270000000 a medical
about 500000000
adult use and we get that total
of over 700000000
in our since date
of first legal
sale.
I'm moving right along
you can see the top
10 cities
in the cannabis industry
some of the should be no
surprise
Albuquerque Santa Fe
Los crucis I
know I'm newer to the state I believe
Rio Rancho is on there as well I think those
are our top 4 largest
cities in terms of population
so no surprises there
also as someone Parke Hobbs
Carlsbad Clovis
they're a little smaller communities but it
really have a thriving
cannabis market there as
well.
Moving along to
total cannabis revenue for
this year really
illustrates the the continued
success
you know from January
1 to September
30 we're looking at over
$410000000
in total revenue we're
not even to the end of the year
yet so again the market
is very alive it's
thriving and we're
seeing good numbers come
from this we're seeing
about you know 2 to one
adult use to what we would consider
medical sales I do
also like to remind
folks that just because people are
purchasing adult use doesn't
necessarily mean that they're not using
these drugs for medicinal
purposes
may just be that they don't have the
card and
they choose local topical
or are I got me to help
with their you know could be a small circle
swing.
And then we got top 10
cities this looks
very similar to what
we see from
date of first legal
sale again
Albuquerque Los crucis
Santa Fe no surprise
that those are probably our top 3 a
largest communities
and then you got someone Parke Hobbs
Rio Rancho Clovis
Farmington Alamogordo
Carlsbad there as well
again very similar to
what we're seeing from
the early days of legalization
we're not seen any the city's
really left off so
again it really shows that the market is
stable on and that
we're we're we're producing
a good amount and people are still
purchasing.
Flipping on over we can get semi
demographic background
these are on license holders
currently so these would be what
we would consider licensees
and we see
the demographic breakdown is changed
slightly again I'm only
about 47 days and looking at
some historical data we 17
any massive changes in
this data maybe a few
points here there
we presented at this you were
the
C. rec Committee here recently which
is the cannabis regulation advisory
committee
and they kind of
confirm that these have changed
slightly but nothing
major we're looking
at about 73 percent
Y. with 48
percent being Hispanic or Latino
and then 51 B. non
Hispanic African
American ownership about
4.4 Asian
American Pacific Islander
3.4
native American American Indian or
Alaskan native
3.one
multi race 6.one and the
other races at 9.3
so haven't
seen those change too
much.
And then some updates we'd like to
provide the committee
that we are currently working on
again very early in my
tenure one of the things
I continue to
really echo is
I am I've taken
over businesses work for a
cannabis company in Colorado
is where my experience comes from I was a
teacher prior to that
this is by far the best hand I've
ever been dealt in terms of personnel
we have folks that want to work
we have folks who are talented and
passionate we
have a nice mix of former law
enforcement former military
and also cannabis
industry workers
we've really got some great cross
training going on where some of these
former law enforcement
military can really help within the
investigatory process of
compliance officers and
then our cannabis people can really
help some of these folks understand what
they're looking at in terms of
cannabis with cannabis
being
and not legal in the
an adult use it a lot of folks
are still learning kind of the ropes
with something compliant should look
like and I think that we have a very
nice mix of folks who are
are working
hard but also can bring some
information and share that's we get a lot
of cross training on that which is very
nice.
Currently we've got
finished our RFP requirements
for seed to sale tracing system
that'll be finalized with the
help of the department of health
the department of health is overseen the
medical side we oversee the adult
use sites were working together to provide
a seed to sale tracing system
that will work for both of us and serve
the community if
you're not familiar with the C. additional
tracing system is
basically this is where we track
cannabis from the time it's
planted in the ground whether it's what
a seed or what
is called a clone which is
essentially the same thing it's a tiny
plant this way we
can ensure that it's tested it's
grown it's gone in New Mexico soil
with New Mexico water in New Mexican
air and we can
ensure that this is tested and tracked
the life cycle of this plant
for that safety that we mentioned a little
earlier.
We're working collaboratively I've been
taking meetings with taxed
Rav the
to office
the state engineers
the department of public safety
and other agencies to build
relationships and learn how
we can AT each other in enforcement
recently we
attended a illicit market
task force in Colorado
and we got to meet some of the folks who
were in the beginning early
stages of of the Colorado
adult use market
not who they have and
and those
rules today and
just like Colorado
Oregon those those first couple of
states were facing similar challenges
so it's really nice
to be able to talk to some of those folks
pick their brains
and find out their experience with
a new industry and a new
market
probably the message I took
away from that was communication
and cooperation
that we work with other
agencies
with the cannabis
compliance or the the V.
D. is what the Colorado calls
at we can really
build these relationships to work
and help one another
and help each other in each
compliance with a meeting with tax
town sure how we're getting
our tax
and how they're able to track
it offices
state engineers very interested in
water how we do that
and like why so working with
a lot of agencies recently to
build relationships that we can continue
this thriving
market.
With the sales force update that's
our licensing
software
we are hopeful by
December
most definitely by the beginning of
the year we will have an online
system for licensees
to go when applied
to their initial applications
do all renewals
in any amendments to those
licenses will all be
online and tracked through an
online system eliminating
any kind of humid air
having better time stance
this will also make it easier for
license to navigate the
application process which can
be a little
cumbersome.
And then the change the license
process that we're
looking at right now.
Currently we
do not require
certain
documentation
to get out of a cannabis
license
we are going to be going for us
for those documentations
to be up front
in to be part of the application
in the beginning we
really feel that this is a good show of
cooperation with the other agencies
and departments but as
well our application
and license is the most
expensive if you're not able to
get a business license and let's say
Albuquerque for $100
I want to give you a license for 10000
knowing that you won't be able to operate
so this will also make sure that the
licensees are being able
to operate as soon as
they get our license because they've checked
all the other boxes
and again we'll all be online we're
excited for this to go we are
hopeful early
November but I am a
under promise
and over deliver type of person
so January would be a great
day for us to be out as
well.
With that being said with licensing
we want to move on to
a compliance and then
we'll kind of move into some licensing
numbers currently
for the year we've
completed 572
inspections
409 net retail
29 producer and
about 34
manufacturing
when you look at these numbers
keep in mind that there are a
significant amount of retail
operations and then from
there there's a little
less producer and then
manufacture and we some of the
more limited license not that there's
not
enough but that's what you
see in a gross difference in
those retail
having a much larger footprint
again production build smaller
manufacturing be even smaller than
that Act
we found
2700
violations in those
572
inspections
those can be for minor things like
not having a floor plan
for your business posted or
could be even more severe
as not storing product or
having miss
packaged product or non compliant
packaging as well
so not
to say that industry is not doing well
some of these violations are are
mitigated in fixed
within a matter of
days.
The total notice
of contemplated action issued
as of September is
10
we also have a couple more that will be
coming out
currently we have 4 settlements
to pending hearings
we've revoked 3 licenses
and were granted one preliminary
injunction
one of my gender are councils actually
at another hearing today as why
he wasn't able to join so we are
out doing as much as we can and
forcing as well as we
can.
And then if you flip
kind of give you an update on where we're
headed with compliance
in July we added 7
additional compliance officers
doubling our total to
13.
We are looking at me in
NYC I compliance manager
here looking at efficiencies in geo
mapping how can we can be smarter
and they the facilities and
premises we are
and
inspecting you know we're not just going
here we're gonna go here and hit I
along the way and then hit 3 on the way
home
realization of
officers
we are looking at ways to it be more
efficient in closing out
compliance violations
working with the licensees
and so we're compartmentalized in a little
bit more where we've actually
created a team
that is is specifically
closing out these
investigations and working
with the licensees to rectify
those so that they're speaking to the
same folks every time
it can be a little frustrating to get 13
different messages now the have a
consistent person they can reach out
to.
We continue to focus on learning and
development as I stated earlier we've got a
nice mix of folks training
really works well with the cross
training
daily tracking of statistics we
currently are tracking
licenses
my compliance manager Nick
has been tasked with completing
something very similar that we can get to
the public so we know how many plants are
growing on a daily basis
what sales are for the daily basis
transactions what's being
destroyed our
top
top categories for
sales
in a list of other things that will give more
transparency to the vision and show
our compliance efforts and what we're
doing
following up with complaints is something
that's huge for us we urge
the community to anytime they see
non compliant action or something that just
doesn't seem right please follow
complaint we look into those
very agree
justly we look hard to
find those and we rely on the
community to help
us
we also will be working a little bit
more in our bio track which is our C.
additional tracing
and conducting investigations through
their we don't
always have to be a facility would
always have to be at a premise
to see that someone is
leaving a digital footprint that looks
odd we're looking
into those 2 and growing that area
2 and doing a lot of training
there are folks in cannabis
who worked in the industry
really help us with seen
those oddities there
and those are just large digital
footprints we know something is going
on and we want to follow
some bread crumbs in New follow that
kind of traditional idea of
investigations and then
lastly like I mentioned earlier
really working with those departments
to see what we can
do to help them and
likewise whether that's what tax
this state engineers D. P.
S. and a myriad of
other departments that
we overlap
with.
Currently for the
licenses we
have about 2700
premises this means that this is
a location
where
can is either being sold
manufactured or
produced
with that you get a
break down of a vertically
integrated licenses these are
licenses that have the ability
to have one
license but had manufacturing
production and retail
hi the micro integrated
there are 299 of those
on these are a little bit smaller
operations
that are given
some breaks at the
licensing and they're also
limited in how many plants they can
grow compared to
a vertically integrated
this is that
ability for folks to come to
the cannabis industry that would have
never had a part
in other legal
states I don't know
of another program similar to this
in another legal state so
it is amazing that the the folks
of New Mexico get to chase their
dream of owning these
operations working
compliantly
and the C. about 1218
individual licenses and we've
got the numbers listed
out there retailers again you see
is kind of the bulk
than manufacturing
producer
producer micro businesses just
again it's a micro
producer they have a limited number of
plants that they can
grow but they do get
some license cuts
and allows them to not have
to have large capital
to get a foot in this
industry.
And then lastly
we have some legislative
ideas
as the madam chair
spoke about some of the committee members
this was
legislative process and
we need to look at this every year
you're just some ideas that might
help or a the
department the division
a couple of these are something
we've seen a lot of and in
requests the first
1 is the requirement of a bio
metric federal background
check we think this is
is very important
to see who is in our industry
are they following
the law and other states
do they have a background in other states
currently we rented DPS report
that would only have the state
of New Mexico
to eliminate the revocation of the
plant count limits which is set to
expire in
2025
this is just going to keep bringing this back
to the table at this point to to
to keep pushing this
sunset on this would allow us to kind of get
to newer business.
The the limitations on
medical cannabis
licensing
to allow persons license
pursuant to the liquor control act
also I have a
license pursuant to the cannabis
regulation Act
this was probably just an
unfortunate kind of
consequence where you're
not able to own a liquor license
and a cannabis license we
don't see a conflict of interest in that
as long as the 2 are being sold in the same
premise.
Definitions to clarify
with a micro business retail products
manufactured from other
integrated microsd again
I think this is just an unintended
consequence some of these micro
businesses are not able to do business
with other microbicides
and this is something we really want
to
faster encourage I
hope some micro producers sell to
each other and get again gets those
folks in New Mexico ceded
the table that would have
elsewhere.
And then lastly the
authority for my division
to seize and
destroy unlawfully
possessed cannabis and cannabis
products we currently don't have
anything like that
however the
bye bye Division getting
this power would also require some
funding to be able to do
this
to be able to destroy the house
these kind of it
unlawful grow so
on these are just some of the
legislative ideas we
have
specially an agenda for us or
anything
and then just thank you
again Todd Stephens on
that cannabis control division
3 answer questions folks thank
you thank you so much
then you want to go ahead and
go.
Chair.
Senators and representatives my name is Ben
Lewin Jr on the executive director
of New Mexico campus chamber of
commerce I'm
gonna keep my comments pretty brief
because we have to
exemplary operators here with
us today and my hope is that we can have a
very vibrant a queue
in a and
questions from the
committee directed
to folks who are actually
in the industry to add some contacts
to
Todd and and my presentation
right now
I I organize this the way that my
brain is organized so apologies
in advance for that I will say
that this document is pretty dense
so please I'm gonna go
over just a few sections
but I do encourage everybody
if they're interested in this industry
to to go through it
pull up the articles that are linked in the
references and
that there's a lot of really wonderful
things happening in the cannabis industry
New Mexico but there are
some things that we need to address
to ensure that
we continue to experience
the industry and that a
mature is the way that it
should.
I did include a timeline here at the
beginning and I just want to
point out to parts in the the
first 1 is the second point on the
timeline that in 1978
New Mexico had the very first
medical cannabis program
in the country less
than a decade after president
Nixon made cannabis
a schedule 1 drug
and then our medical cannabis program
which ran
from 2009
in till be legalized for
adult use was
really a model of how
medical cannabis program should operate
in other states and I I bring this up
because New
Mexico has a special relationship
in a special history with cannabis
nobody at this table is gonna say
recreational you'll notice that everybody
says adult use and that's
because
operators and our
regulators and people in the industry
recognize the
inherent
value in cannabis is
medicine and we
just you know want to
share an acknowledge that
every use of cannabis is is
medical cannabis is not the same
as alcohol and
even if you don't have a medical
cannabis card you're
still using cannabis in a
different way than you use alcohol
and that differences recreational
verses and all use.
I also want to point out the last part
in the time line that's 2024
and beyond and I I point
this out because
this is exactly the
mission of of our
organization which is the
the industry association for the
cannabis industry it's
for the long term health and viability
of this industry
it's for 10
or 15 years down the road
when somebody decides that
they want to retire
or whatever brings
them the to this industry that there are
still pathways for people
to enter into the
cannabis industry well
into the future and I think
that's a hallmark of a
healthy healthy
industry whatever the industry
is and and certainly so for
cannabis.
I want to share an industry snapshot
so these are are just bullet points
that I think are kind of the most important
bullet points but they start to tell a
story about what's
happening in the industry right
now and why we need to
take legislative action and
rulemaking action
to
make corrections or
double down on places where we know
the industry working so
as I bring these up please keep
these in mind for your your
questions for Tony and
Dylan
next and
then if I can interrupt for those on
the on the web your hand out
is available online right
now and will be getting the
departments up there shortly
great thank you
the total adult use of sales of
cannabis has basically
increased month
over month it's
basically increased
from the same month of the previous
year and we have now
18 months 19 months in the
industry so we have a track
record of
months that are months later peaks
in months that are valleys but
overall the cannabis industry
continues to grow and I'll explain
the basically here in a
second
while the revenue the total revenue
for the industry continues to
grow the average cart
size and the average monthly
revenue per licensed
retailer continues
to decrease and
at some points at an alarming
rate and that's because
as as Todd mentioned we have
2700 licensed
premises
300 micros and we still
have more people coming into
the industry every day
New Mexico is very
likely over producing
cannabis and the
the main documents that I
reference in the reference
section is
this New Mexico cannabis
demand modeling
which came
from
a cannabis public policy
consulting firm contracted by
CCD and
then before
we legalized for adult use
the New Mexico legalization
cultivation capacity
analysis and this was
prepared by one
of the L. NPP's from the medical
program but these 2
documents combined have a lot
of good information pry the best
information about what
we actually understand is
that. To demand for adult
use cannabis in New
Mexico.
So even from
the you know CC's
document we
are very likely over
producing cannabis right
now and this is not
new for the industry 2
for the industry New Mexico because the
industry New but
California
Washington
Colorado certainly
Oklahoma other
states are also over producing
cannabis and we
have the opportunity from
those states to see what New
Mexico is going to look like
in 12 months and 18
months and you know several
years down the road and
and that's why
you know taking legislative
action is is so
important
as of January the top 10
highest producing cultivation
licenses accounted for half
of the estimated total supply for
New Mexico so
you have 10 producers
out of
however many licensed producers
there are who are cultivating
more than half of what's
needed for New
Mexico
and.
When our industry when when our
organization decided to
really lean into legalization
because when we started
you know we started with the medical program
and as as
an association we weren't
ready to to legalize
when we first started it took us a
couple years to get there and
when we we did decide to
do that we said okay what we're gonna
do is we want
unlimited licensing we want
everybody who wants an opportunity
to be in the industry to be in
the industry but that means
that you have to manage the production
you can have over
production you can have
limited by a limited plan
counts because then
you're in an over production
situation like we're in right
now and the
the fact that there are so few
operators producing so
much cannabis I think it's something
that we can address of your
rulemaking but that's
part of the the situation
that we were in
and this kind of over
production you don't
start to see the ramifications
of that for 2 or 3 years down
the road as we've learned from
from other states.
The presence of eliciting grey market
cannabis continues to greatly
exacerbate
oversupply when I see
green market I'm talking about cannabis
that is probably legally
produced in Oklahoma legally
produced in California
there is an oversupply
in those states as well so those
products come into New Mexico
and either the the
slap in New Mexico label on
it or in some
instances they don't just
leave the California label on it and
I'm very grateful that CCD has
really ramped up
enforcement efforts because
they've started to close down some
of those bad operators who really
had no intention of
operating within the legal
regulatory framework of our
state but we still
have a lot of product that is just
coming across the borders and
being introduced
into our state traceability
software as if it was grown in New
Mexico and that is going
to take continued effort from
CCD
to.
Well that problem that that's not going
away anytime soon but
we're we're finally starting to
see some some
movement
movement there.
As of August twenty twenty three
there were 100
1000 21
cannabis retailers
to give you an idea Colorado
which is a state almost 3 times
Mexico's population has
roughly the same
amount of licensed retailers
and there is a Texas affects
where if you go you
know 50 miles into
Texas across the entire
Texas New Mexico border
that almost doubles
the The New Mexico consumer base
so I I do want to be clear that even
though we have vastly
different populations are
proximity to Texas does
make a difference but you can
see
Colorado which is probably the
most mature market
in our country in in lots
of ways
they have basically the same number of
retailers that New Mexico
has.
40 percent of
reported sales
these are 603 operators
who reported sales in August
40 percent of those sales
had less than
$25000
a month in revenue the average was
11660
and that's 8 percent of the total
adult use market a
cannabis business cannot
survive on $25000
a month in revenue and
the built Lubin
who is the the CEO
of dynamic Jack and
he has a a
can company called data
heard and he does a really good
job using the
publicly available CCD
information which by the way no
other states has this level
of transparency in
the amount of data that CCT
posts their website every
month with by I think is
another one of the hallmarks the
industry he does a really
good job of using that data
to find
information on what's happening in a lot
of the information here
is from a presentation that he gave
to our members and
August
and he's actually updated
that survival threshold
and this is what in California
the survival threshold is
is $50000 in
revenue a month so
what this means is
the majority of the mom and
pop businesses
are not gonna be able to
survive I think
that same data also
tells that the way
that we went about legalizing cannabis
there's a success story in there
because 40 percent of the operating
storefronts are small
and medium sized home
grown New Mexico businesses
which is exactly what the promise
was when
our state decided to legalize cannabis
so you know it's kind
of a double edged sword that we
have a
diversity in
different people different
operators of licenses
but it's
the operators who we
want to to survive
who are having the biggest struggle
right now because of oversupply because
of the illicit
market.
As of September so this
gentleman bill sloop and again if you're
interested in cannabis please follow him
on link then he gives
his monthly analysis
one CCD posts
their their publicly
available data
so I said
basically continues to increase
because this is the first
time September
is the first time that total
sales decreased
just by 2 percentage points
bigger for the medical cannabis
market so I think what that
means is that the
industry is starting to
to level out perhaps I I think
that will continue to grow in total
revenue but I I don't
expect us to experience
as dramatic a growth
as we have over the last 18
months.
60.7 percent of
New Mexicans who use cannabis
indicated that it is very
easy or easy to
access illicit
drugs.
63 percent reported
that they obtain their
cannabis via regulated
legal sources which
again means that the way that we would
about legalizing with
a moderate tax rate
is successful we
are under cutting the
illicit market that's grown
here and we're starting to
undercut the the grey market
or the illicit market that's coming in
from other states which.
Another hallmark of success for
cannabis
industry.
I want to talk about the legislative
priorities I told
Todd call them ideas I don't
know if priorities is a a
stronger statement
but chair
Hamblin mentioned at the
beginning
when Representative Martinez
now speaker Martinez
was the original sponsor the
Kandace regulation Act he made it
very clear that this is a living
document that it's
incumbent on the legislature to
come back and revisit the cannabis
regulation Act every year
we have had bills the
last 2 years
endorsed by CCD and
endorsed by the industry that have
not gone the distance
so I I plead
with with committee members
and the Legislature hole that
some of these things
desperately need to packs
we have some desperately
needed fixes to the cannabis
regulation act that have
to pass during this 30 day
session to ensure the
overall health of the industry
and I if
if you want to toward
a facility whatever it the
industry can do
and and wherever you're coming
from in New Mexico I know
that we've had
Representative little I think was at a
manufacturing tort that we did
in Santa Fe.
Please come and and
see what operators are doing
see the the maturity
and
and and what this industry
is doing in New Mexico and
whatever we can do to help
legislators feel more empowered
to help us and
help the the the
division to pass a bill
not now is the time to do
that.
So our legislative priorities I'll go
through this quickly I will say
that we enjoy very good working
relationship with the cannabis
control division and other state
agencies and
everything but
CCD is pushing
forward this legislative
session we fully agree
with and then we have a couple other
things that we are discussing
with CCD
I I don't want to speak
for superintendent
tricky or for Todd
but everything
in here.
I think that we're working with
CCD and some
version of this will end up
being the official
legislative agenda for
the cannabis chamber.
The first big bucket is
we need to enhance the ability for
CCD to sufficiently
regulate the
industry
right now the cannabis control division
in New Mexico does not have
parity with other regulators
in other states
there is a lot of a
lot of things that are Division
needs a
lot of it is related to funding
a lot of it is related
to.
Starting up a a brand new
industry in a brand new division
and such a tort short time
frame that we know now a lot
more than we did at the time
but CCD
needs the ability to
regulate the industry
and that means
removing the sunset of plant
count limits so in
the camps rigid regulation
act we had sunset
the plant count
which means the total production
any single producer can
produce the the maximum
plants that the
cultivation cultivator could
produce
right now the the plant
count limit is
set to sunset at
the end of 2025
the only other state that has
unlimited licensing
unlimited productions Oklahoma
and the reason that we have so much
product coming in from Oklahoma
is that state
did not do enough to curb
that frankly the crisis that
they're in right now that we're experiencing
because of that
crisis.
When we were initially pushing
for legislation
again we wanted
large diversity of license
holders producing
a moderate amount of plants
and what the industry was pushing for
was 5000 plants
the the. The
the medical cannabis program we had
34 license nonprofit
producers they were producing
700 1000
700 501750
plants and that
satisfied the entire medical
program and I don't want to be
poly Anish but
people who had a medical card
were also providing cannabis
for people who did not have a medical
card so that was
that was providing cannabis
for a lot more than
150000
registered medical cannabis
people so
the association the the
canvas chamber was pushing for
an upper tier of 5000
plants maximum to
start what we
agreed on or what the the
legislation and the building was
10000 and then there
was a big concern that there was
not going to be enough supply on day
1 so through emergency
rule that plant count was
increased to 20000
and that's where it stands
so we have a small number of
producers that are producing
20000 plants
that is too much
and if we do not
do anything to address the
the plant count limit
then those producers will be able to
produce an unlimited amount of
plants and what
we want is we want opportunity
for small and medium sized
home grown businesses to be
successful we want an
opportunity for businesses to be able
to come into this industry
10 years down the road
and still be able to carve out a
line. And right
now that over production
is going to be a challenge
for
that.
There was language
in house bill 12
which was the bill
in the regular session that
went through 2 house committees
was voted off the house floor
when 3 Senate tax with the Senate
Judiciary and was
sitting on the Senate floor
ready to be voted off when we ran
out of time and then as
house bill 12 became house
bill 2 in the special session
this section
on.
H. 3 and I just copied and
pasted the whole thing
this disappeared
from the bill
and this is the language that
allows our campus
control division to have the authority
that every other
cannabis regulatory
agency and every other state
has and that's the
ability to pa's
new licenses that the ability
to add plant count that's
the ability to reduce
plank out that's the ability
to really help the industry
to maintain equal to
equilibrium maintain
balance which is critically
important at the beginning and
this was one of the things that our
organization fought
really hard for in the
cannabis regulation Act especially
for the first few years in the of
this industry and
this is probably our biggest
priority is to add that language
back into the C. R. A.
to empower our
legislature are to empower
regulators to be
able to do their job and regulate the
industry.
The second bucket is to
enhance the ability
to sufficiently enforce rules
and regulations
and Mr
morning and Mr
Stevens
deserve a lot of applies
because CCD in the last
2 months has really ramped
up enforcement ramped up
compliance we
need to do more we need
to do better
and this we haven't
worked out the details but
suffice it to say that CCD
needs more authority
on their own to prove to
to do enforcement
activities.
Todd mentioned the destruction of
illegal drugs we
had of one story
where in out of
state
distributor I guess.
They got caught bringing in
leaders of distillate
from other states
they were finds the
were
you know everything within the full
power of CCD based
on the canvas regulation
act but
that product was
probably introduced
into the illicit market that product
could have been reintroduced
into the regulated market
and that's because again C. C. doesn't
have the ability to do their job which
includes destruction
of illegal
drugs.
The next bill and under that is a
typo it's not remove plant
count it's remove the micro plant
count from statute
plant count limitations
are done via rulemaking
except for microlights
senses which is the
the entry point the pathway for
people mostly New
Mexico businesses who want to get into
the industry and right
now that plant count limit is
in statute in
last year's house bill
313 from
Representative Romero
her suggestion was to
index the micro plant
counts to the highest
commercial level so if
it's 10 percent of
20000 plants that means the
microplate count would be 2000
and that had a lot of support for
microlights and holders
I would love to see that language
inserted back into the C.
R. A. nonprofit
conversion language
when we had our medical
program operators
who were vertically integrated
were required to
register as a state chartered
nonprofit not a federal
nonprofit but a state chartered
nonprofit that's whether called
Ellen P. P.'s license
nonprofit producers
right now there is not
language
to do
a conversion from a nonprofit
to a for profit entity
this is a 1 time
conversion that makes
it possible for those assets
to go along with
a new for profit
organization that makes it possible
for things like
employee owns
a cannabis businesses
and this just needs to be a
1 time change
and I think for that
when I put the exact language
that was in house bill 313
last year
into the reference section
so you can see exactly what it
was and again this
is 1 of those fixes that's
desperately needed right
now.
There was a lot of excitement as we
were passing that the
cannabis regulation act news
gonna pass and I think
it was in one of the the
last committees at
the end
legislator
added a piece
increasing the excise
tax by one percentage point
every year this is
a mistake there was a lot
of work done in the governor's working
group and that
12 percent
excise tax
is.
Very informed on
what is going to undercut the
illicit market and actually you
know in discussions
with
with Dylan
we've seen that other states
have actually reduce that tax and
that just helps to further undercut
the illicit market so
our organization is pushing
to remove that
escalation of one percentage
point on the excise tax
every year because
as we continue to increase the
tax people are going
to find
cannabis elsewhere that isn't
safe that is
untested.
This is probably one
of the enhancement pieces
more than a fix but a picnic
license.
There is a lot of tourism
activities happening right now in New
Mexico and we are very
happy to see
Texas license plates not
only at dispensaries
but also in Reno
so in places
like angel fire we know
that people are coming
to you
know come for New
Mexico's wonderful natural
landscapes are balloon fiestas
and they're staying
because of our
wonderful sun
kissed cannabis
and the ability to have a picnic
license which would be
you know like a a liquor picnic
picnic license where you could have
an event and you get a
one time license
to have consumption
at the event
whether it be a concert
or whether it be one
of our our merry Jane
mingles which is the canvas that working
events that are organization
hosts every few months
where people could enjoy cannabis
I think the the
biggest obstacle
to this is still the stigma
of cannabis because when you think
about a liquor
license when you think
about getting you know an
alcohol license for a wedding or
something that's
right in your brain that's no problem
at all and we want to see the same thing
for for cannabis
and then the the
fixes to the
C. R. A. these are exactly the
things that Mr
Stevens mentioned
adjusting the federal background check
language fixing
the unintended consequence of
the C. R. A. that disallowed
micro micro wholesale
transactions which is
hugely important
and
you know again the intention was not to
ever co locate liquor and
cannabis and the way it was
written was if you have a liquor
license you can never
participate in the cannabis industry
and that needs to be fixed.
And that's really it I I do
want to again please just go
through this future policy
considerations right
now we have hemp
derived can be no
aids available at gas
stations so this is
intoxicating
teach the substances
that are derived from hemp
not regulated by the cannabis
industry not
any of the testing that the
cannabis operators who have to face
and this is a national
thing other states have taken
wildly different approaches but
this is one of the things that our state
is going to have to
really take on in in future
sessions
Interstate cannabis
commerce.
Places like California and Washington
this is one of their big solutions
to deal with their over supplies
to legally send it to New
Mexico I
would love if there was a
future where New Mexico
is
exporting our cannabis
alongside our green Chile to
other legal states
and I I think that's the
conversation we need to have
federal snapshot safer
banking passed through
the the
house and Congress several times
it looks like it's finally gonna pass through
the Senate this allows financial
institutions to
do cannabis banking and
we have I think 3
or 4 banks
in New Mexico now that will
open a cannabis account but there's
no Lente there's no
traditional banking
services that exist in this
industry.
And those accounts
charge you know a
hefty fee in New Mexico upwards
of $700 a month just to
have an account
plus 7
to 10 to 15 percent of all
transactions.
And then rescheduling federally
this is the biggest thing
to happen with cannabis
policy at the national
level and we
we actually have a call it at
noon today to talk
about rescheduling
cannabis from schedule 1 to
schedule 3 which I think
looks really good because it would
remove the tax implications
for 280 E. which
makes it impossible for cannabis
businesses to write off
regular tax expenses that every
business is able to
but it also opens up cannabis
to big pharma and
there's just a lot of unknowns
for what that would look like at the
state level if cannabis
were rescheduled from schedule
1 to schedule
3 and then you
know finally in the references
if you're looking at the PDF I
went all these documents
and I did.
Have I did put
in one entire article in
this is just a a very recent
article where I was interviewed
about the state of cannabis New Mexico
so you can again see
kind of a lot in that article that
hopefully came across and
and this presentation
right now and
what I like to do right now
is you know
have a doing in Tony
introduce themselves and then
again really just have as much time
for Q. NA as possible
thank
you.
Hi I'm dealing
gross thank you guys
for being here and
for listening.
I think this is really helpful for us to
kind of directly speak to you
guys from our experience
I think that
the perspective of these 2 is
fantastic
and I
I really appreciate you know hearing
from Todd directly I think
that
empowering CCD
is a huge thing which
I think that.
You know it would be
somewhat intuitive to think that businesses
might be scared of
empowering and enforcement
division
but at the same time
clarity on rules
enforcement on bad
actors these
are things that we we desperately
need but
I own yes can in cannabis
along with my partner
Shane back here as
well
we are retail only operation
we're only base-t or not a
chain
and thankfully we're
able to maintain being
pretty successful
in this
in this market
basically due to both
our local ownership
and the fact
that.
I have been in this industry
for
a little over or roughly
10 years and across
several different states
and so
I'm.
Somewhat on a lot of
friends I'm pretty overjoyed about
how New Mexico has
set this up I
think the
priority on
micro business licenses
is an
absolutely
fantastic
kind of the repeat thing that I've
seen over and over and over again
in other states and that
includes Colorado
Illinois Missouri
and a little bit
of sort of consulting
work in
places like Massachusetts
and Vermont is well
is that the kind
of constant over
arching fear for
cannabis businesses is
that large
corporate and conglomerate
chains stores come in
and they gobble up
licenses
they.
Basically can artificially
drive up the value of those
licenses such
that.
Once you get to a point where license
cost 3 to $500000
just enter the industry because
they're artificially capped
in different
ways
you know we we
see.
Basically the the barrier to
entry become so high
that no middle
income person could ever enter
the industry I
am a person of you know
a blue collar background as
is my partner we did not come
from you know
families with lots of capital
the fact that we could succeed
and become you
know owners in this business
is kind of a testament to how
it can operate
and to touch
on you know some of his
specific points
you know we've heard a lot
about some of the multi state
operators coming in
and
looking to set immediate
caps on licensing and
moratoriums on
licensing
oversaturation is a
problem and it should be
dealt with in some capacity
but we think that CCD should
be able to do that
with a great
level of analysis
and a really careful
attention to detail about how
you do that and
remembering that
a solution for Albuquerque
is not a solution for tasks
is not a solution for Red
River these blanket
state wide
solutions just don't
work across rural
areas and smaller
cities and larger
cities
and so.
Yeah yeah and
my my only other thing
I'll just try to finish
is mentioning
that taxation
is one of our biggest problems
the people that pay the sales tax
which is about roughly
4 times the sales tax
of alcohol which seems fairly
obscene to me
are the customers often
very low income customers
and we would like to see some amount
of relief we are
proud of the tax revenue that we
generate however
we'd like to see that coming
from
it not out of pockets of low
income people but
out of the folks
who have 20000 plants
in their warehouse who are
diluting the market and kind
of creating the conditions
that there are so
I would hope that the escalation
of sales taxes a priority
is something that does not
go on continuing to increase
that over time
and
that we kind of
reimagined tax policy
going forward in some of
the future sessions but I'll
pass it over to Tony from
here thank you
Tony I just want to we do want to go
ahead and have an opportunity
for questions and so
I'll I'll let you
do your thing real quickly if you don't
mind we'll keep it brief
thank you madam chair and the
committee for being here
today
so we are a small
producer we
grew about
2400 plants last
year and this year we
retracted and grew about
1400
because we saw such
immediate saturation
that we didn't see any point in continuing
to grow at the scale
my father took early
retirement to start this
business my brother
sold medical document storage
company this business I left
a really good job at
one of the most successful
NPP's to give
this a shot for
ourself.
The fact that we
saw so
much has happened so
quickly I feel
like being the first license
in the state you can use us as
sort of a Canary in the coal
mine we have a very
respected brand
we sell out the high
median level
price wise for the products that we
produce and
that's very steadily because
the brand is respected
but if we're struggling
to pay these taxes
to move this product
then I can only
imagine some of the struggles that
some of these mom and pop that
this whole movement
was crafted
for I can only
imagine the the troubles
that they're going to be up against
because you have your embedded costs
but if you don't move that product you're
literally holding
the back and we
do have an opportunity I'm very
inspired by what I've heard
from Todd in NYC that priorities
being
that we see them Forsman
actions page growing and
and we really need a well
regulated market
to eliminate a few
of the bad actors that are
creating massive
problems for everyone I don't
think that problems are sometimes
as widespread as they can
seem you know
the dispensaries that are
operating.
Do know selling illicit drugs seem
to get a lot of the attention but I do
believe more of the problem
is on producers that
are misusing their licenses
as pass throughs for
out of state product to move into
the state
and and so we
just I I strongly
encourage you to look through these
documents that Bennett
shared and
to you know help
taught in his role as leaders
CCD to really
start to bring their relationships
and conversations together so
that way we can get to
commonsense regulation
that protects the farmers
protects the the need to meet
retailers
but given the CCD
the teeth that it needs to
carry out these actions just
paramount because just
for example the dispensary
that dominates our town
I don't know what their
moral and ethical
stance on things is or how
much research they did but what I
can say is one of our first
wholesale deals
was with Dylan and his partner
Shane they drove from here
inTaos they came to our farm
the verified that we were growing
everything on site they
checked references
that I gave them like they asked really
good questions they did due
diligence and that's
why there dispensary
is being respected locally
is they really did
make sure that they had a
safe supply chain
a lot of the retailers that
are probably being used a
shining stars for their
successes
have not done so they
moved a lot of
products that was very
questionable and
these morals and ethics of really hurt
us as a retailer we also have a
retail store but because
we don't carry products that we
knew well before the CCT
enforcement action page came
out that these
the prices are too good to be true
it's like been said we went into
emergency rule making to
get 20000 plant count
because every single
conversation dealt
with shortages we spend a
huge amount of time with
the committees and different things talking
about how are we gonna protect medical
patients because every
other state had a
shortage that was
serious that affected medical
patients like for instance Colorado
I believe went
through its supplies and
3 days of
recreational being passed so the
medical patients could not access
medicine we came up it
took so much back and forth
is a 5050 is a
7030 but in the beginning
of rack you couldn't do more than
70 percent
adult use
sales
to your medical cells
because you had to protect some of
your supply for those medical
people to my knowledge
that mechanism was
never utilized
so from day 1 of
this product project being
launched the illicit
market stepped in
and has
taken the lion's share
of the
proceeds and so
if I families like
minor struggling to
make ends meet a month
admits the
the you know the
regulations that we deal with
that are hurting us are the
280. E. and things like this
that that really stifle
they would stifle any business if you put
a construction company
under our tax regime
even some of the most successful
companies that you can think
of would probably instantly
go out of business within 6 months
you know they would plead their cash right
would bleed they would not be able
to make it because those write offs
are what allow
the difference between success
and failure and so we're up against
a very high
bar in some
ways but very low
bar and others and
so have
that C. R. AC Committee
have the power was supposed to
have when it was house
bill 1412
when it was house bill 12
I don't believe any of this would have
happened you know but that
language alone being
stripped completely
threw everything into a tailspin
because it allowed these bad actors
to take advantage of the
fact that the department was
new take
advantage of the fact the names and
the faces kept changing
and and they were allowed to carry
out you know
a lot of illegal
activity in a clause I
legal way and it's her
retailers it's hard
farmers and
it continues to
permeate the environment but
like been said we have a chance
now to not become
Oklahoma
and that's why you know I
see the recommendations
that have been made on both sides of the table
being so important
and there's nothing that I've heard today
from either of them that I'd
I don't agree with there's maybe questions
that I have lectured micros
go to 2000 we
don't even have 2000 plants anymore
we're we're by license
so I don't know the answer to some
of those I think that's worth having all
the conversations but I
haven't heard anything today
that I would say you know that's crazy
or that doesn't make any sense
this is common sense things
and these are
things that I think could simply
be addressed in the
legislature having participate in
the past I think
we can build a lot of
you know momentum around
the ideas that have been presented
today and
and go from there so thank you for
your time and I will stand. For
questions great thank you so
much I appreciate that I
know we do have
representative Armstrong Representative
Ortez representative
Gallegos representative
Duncan Representative
Zamora Senator
Ortiz C.
Pino.
And Representative
little.
Almost the whole committee
here today
I know that
we also in Senate
Intelisys well
I we do have our speakers to
our speakers are here just let you know
about 30 to 40 minutes
behind schedule.
Okay so thank you for your patience
I appreciate that
I do want to make just a quick
comment I think
many of us are seen in a specially
in our communities that there are
some dispensaries that are shutting
down.
From an economic development perspective
as somebody who runs a green chamber of
commerce who has made a lot
of cannabis dispensaries as
businesses part of the
challenges that
there are folks who are investing
their life
savings their
mortgages and they're not
approaching these like businesses they
are businesses
if you don't run it like a business
you will fail
and so I'm
I'm.
Very interested in the idea
of as much as it I hate
the idea of stifling
entrepreneurship of
putting a pause on
licenses just so that we
can work with those businesses
to get their
foundation a lot
more solid in
Los crucis is K. R. city
economic development department does
provide classes for
dispensaries to help them
develop a business plan and
understand what their projections are
and what profit and loss are
where is this SPDC
and west any of the agencies that
receive funding from the federal government
cannot provide that
guidance and
so in our case our
economic development department is taking
that on understanding what is
happening so I
do appreciate that I do also
like the idea of an op canna
tourism.
With a picnic license that is going
to and in my
capacity with the green
chamber those conversations
this have happened
also I think I've dropped to you
been about how
we can recycle the
containers that
pre rolls come in because
it just absolutely
send me off the
edge when I see those
different containers just lying
around so
you know you but you know that that's
my my focus as well
so I will go ahead
and go to representative
Armstrong than Representative
Ortez representative guy goes
committee if we can
keep our questions release
specific and if
you all can make sure that you keep your answers
very specific if there any follow
ups we will certainly do that so
Representative Armstrong
thank you madam chair
and
thank you for The presentation I
have so many questions
so many questions but
one thing I can tell you is that we
cannot legislate morals
or ethics.
Do that.
So or
right off the bat you know
can't with the
licensing
control cannot
be contained at the
local level through
the
counties county commissions
city councils didn't
they are they able to put in their
own regulations
on how many
dispensaries they can have
in in their
towns or villages
is is that a sort of
control
would that be helpful is
it helpful as far as
over licensing.
Madam chair
representative there
are some time place and
manner restrictions but I
don't believe there is an ability
for a municipality
or county to cap the
number of licensees are
premises but there are some
restrictions on operating
times
where some zoning
but nothing in the lines of the
numbers okay
thank you for that and and
thank you madam chair and I I also
heard you say you want
to put.
Getting a business license in
front of getting a cannabis
license because right
now it's not they to apply for the
cannabis license and then they get
and then they decide where they're going to
put it Madam
chair representative correct
to that there's a little bit in my
opinion of of putting a little bit of
the cart before the horse if
our license is the most expensive
and and I I don't
used the word controversial
but are should probably be the last
issued after you've had got
gotten guidance from the O. S.
C. your business
and again treating these as madam chair
said like a business rather than
just I want to jump in and get
going love the passion
but we are going to
put up the those kind
of
documentations to be placed
forward in our new licensing system
that should launch in the
December.
Thank you madam chair I'm glad to hear
that I I do have a
a lot of constituents complain
about the farms
I Representative Valencia
County had some
issues down there
where you know cannabis
farm comes in and
and the neighbor
who's right next to it
the smell that had a
lot of complaints about the smell
and and what that
does to some people some
people it doesn't do anything
to
I'm curious if you've
asked or been working
with the governor to make sure
that this type
of legislation that you're
requesting legislative
priorities is going to be on the
call.
So for us in the CCTVs
are more just ideas rather than
priorities are suggestions
we hope to work with the governor's office
we hope to work with other constituents
representatives
shareholders from large
vertically integrated to
some of the gentleman that are here today
to take in those accounts but
at this point these are just ideas
from our division
unnecessarily
suggestions our priorities.
I I will say that we've had several
conversations with the governor's
office and the
governor's aware
of some of the
urgency of this of these
issues and
I I can't imagine that she
wouldn't put
give give some cannabis
bill message at this
point. Thank you for
that I I think if there's if
something needs to be fixed we need to
get it fixed
and and I agree with you I think she
would put it on the call but I was just
curious if you'd have those
conversations one
question I have is
on the first presentation
where it says the total
sales
the in the adult use
its tax to differently than
the medical is is that
correct.
Madam chair representative yes
that is correct okay
I would I I assume
to that and I remember that from
hearing the bill but
you know I I come
to
the the consensus
of.
Cigarette
tax.
Alcohol tax liquor
tax and then cannabis
tax I mean the reason we tax
it in a lot of the reasons that it
passed
people that some of the people voted
for it because we're hoping to get some
kind of revenue I
understand that it could
be a hindrance but it's
also a hindrance when
we talk every
single year about raising
the cigarette tax
when who smoking the
most of the people who
probably can't afford
to be smoking and
spending money on cigarettes and
alcohol are possibly Candace
when they possibly should be spending
money somewhere else
so like I said we
cannot legislate morals or
ethics.
And I believe
that we taxed
it this way in
the we do this
almost on every piece of
legislation madam chair
we get it passed and
then we want to come back and change it
one of the problems we had with
the liquor licenses
you know we only have so
many and so
what did that do it made it
really high I mean to get a
liquor license was you know
$350000.
And if we
allow.
The regulation Department which I am
all I mean I support
you guys 110 percent
and I try my best to always
try to.
The state you know streamline
regulations getting a license
whatever it is I want that
streamlined but I also
don't want to give up legislative
power
to.
Another entity when
it could be you
know the part that was taken
out of Senate of
house bill 12
I'm curious how that
got taken out I mean apparently
at it passed the
house without
language in there and got taken out
on the Senate floor so I'm
curious.
You know there was some kind of deal
maybe obviously that would
have been that what
happened and
so I really
have a problem
letting
rulemaking
happen.
Instead of legislation
and so I'm I'm
I'm
interested to hear other people's questions
and I'll let it go at that
but.
The
over.
The over production
worries
me.
You know I am a.
And I want the regulation
and licensing department to have the
teeth to destroy
and we're fine or
whatever.
But we.
Being a business person
myself.
Starting a business
from the ground up I knew
what I was getting into
I knew when I
if I open to cannabis
business if I open a
dispensary I know
the tax rates I know
everything it's all
pre pre
you know pre done but I do believe
you should be able to get the tax
rebates on
in on on your whatever
you you know whatever
you want to do with that I think it should be the
same as any other
business.
But I also know until they
legalize it at the federal
level it's going to be an
issue for New
Mexico so
thank you madam chair thank
you representative Representative Ortez
than Representative Davis
and representative Duncan thank
you madam chair and welcome to
task for those of you who aren't from here
Representative this district I wanted
thank you inTaos
for hosting us.
Present I'm sure actually acts past
many of my question so
thank you for that
I do have a question about the number
of producers
dispensaries in yes
County do you
have that information.
I I don't currently but I can get those
numbers for you very easily thank
you that's very helpful
I know that the number of retailers
is I believe 10
at this point in time
which is a
fairly excessive
number in the town of
Taos
and I think just
to touch on one thing she asked
earlier
giving sort
of.
Local governments control I
think is helpful but has he
set the time place and manner
somewhat restrictive
the problem with that though is that
I don't know that our town governments
have a
fantastic understanding
of how the industry works
and what sort
of those limits should
be
but point being
that especially in
the retail sector
some of these issues
will sort of work themselves out
in time it is unfortunate
that some businesses
we'll have to go out
of business task cannot stay
in 10 dispensaries
Farmington cannot stand
33
dispensaries
it's it's absurd
frankly but
the retail side I think
is most likely
to work itself out in time
just by the fact of
these markets so just be nice to
see that
it doesn't all consolidate
into large chain stores
while sort of the
smaller mom and pop businesses
die I don't have a
number in terms of how many
producers are inTaos
it's pretty substantial however
a lot of them are micro
businesses and outdoor
producers
and we don't
really have the same
sort of like
20000 plant count
limit massive
producers and I think that that is
by far the
problem you can
have an enormous number of micro
business licenses without
problems but
when you know I
6 companies are producing
20000 plants at a
time that is
where we see the major
problems coming thank you mentioned
is really helpful Dylan I I
appreciate that mean my daughter's
mention the
new the newest store it
feels like a lot more than 10
it feels more like 20
if there were some like
blending of you
know dispensary
and groceries
or ready made food that would
make life a lot
easier for lots of.
Parents and so
Madam I have a couple more
questions
I'm gonna talk a little bit about this
over production and
product coming in from other
states you how is
it possible
that
the producer of state
gummies like wild
for instance you know that
they can dispense
in various states
you know and they're being all over
the New Mexico market is
that that's allowed by
CCD
and of this and I hope she dances
question. Madam
chair representative of the
this is the question that they can
bring product from outside
that is not allowed so
any product it's created by
wild would be created in New
Mexico
Graham with New Mexico
cannabis.
Infused with New Mexican oil
and with New Mexican water and it
was Colorado would be the same way
there's no ability for
these states to
have Interstate Commerce and
is it bring produce madam
chair by New
Mexican
producers.
I would say
on a whole it is
there's there's some bad actors
and and now you know I don't
want to be to dead horse and
and I can see CCD
is taking action things
are happening but what
has traditionally happen
we've we've been in this for almost 2
years now
until.
2 months ago
no licenses has been
taken so there was
no signs
that there was any reason
not to do this because you could look
and see this dispensaries operating
without a license this
companies bringing in product
and I have to compete against them
and how my supposed to
compete when they're not paying taxes
that are just importing product
making what they want what I see
that could be done now without any
further is and I
think it is happening we just haven't
seen the headlines yet and things are going
to move but
when you look at the C. city enforcement
action page which most of these actions
are taken before tauter
Nick were in that that
capacity but the
fines are way too low the I'll
take the example of JBS
technologies got in trouble
for bringing into leaders out of state
additional it their fines
didn't even
compare to the profits that
they made just on that
one shipment of illegal drugs
and if you're buying illegal drugs
3 months ago you
probably been doing it since the very beginning
because we're selling additional
it at $4000
a kilo which is less than
half of what it was under medical
so there's distally around
if you're shopping
with legitimate buyers and you
do with this gentleman did you go
find suppliers
that have sources.
Then there is no problem it's
the people that are
continually
skirting the law and then
they're paying fines that are
fractional compared to the profits
they made so it's
incentivized and then the
fee schedules really where
it got out aligning when I took
serious issue and got mad and
wanted to participate in things like this
is they not only were
issued a one time find they were
given a schedule for it
again it's
30000 if they do it
again it's 50000
and if they do it again it's
100000 they lose their
license so that means you can
commit 4 felonies and pay
$195000
in one calendar year
and still move forward
that to me is the
problems are sending the wrong message
there should have been a no questions
asked hands down you have your
license revoked no pay
to play 15 grand
that's a slap on the
wrist needs a lot to a tiny business
like me but to a
California company that's already made
millions there and is here
I guarantee you they budget
for.
Chair representative
kind of the nuts and bolts of
how this is working is
product can come in from
California state that's already
packaged label for California
and one of the 2 businesses that
CCD has shut
down the
word just selling
product that was
directly you know package
products from California
labeled as California
and that group didn't even show
up to their hearing which makes me
think that was the plan all
along but the other
born Afaria sway
is you have truckloads
of cannabis
flower and cannabis trim
coming into the state
that can be introduced
into our state traceability
software through a couple of
loopholes there's a couple
of places where you could
introduce cannabis
that wasn't grown at your
facility and then it
looks like it's being sold
legally it has a bio track
number and it looks like it's being sold
legally and like it was produced
in New Mexico.
If I if I may before and I do
want to just be cognisant
of time in our our
as some of the.
Limit questions to
3 maximum of 3
if you have any others to please
write those down in here and we'll get
those to the people
just because we are still way
behind schedule we still
have another presentation before
lunch so I'll remove
you representative little thank you very
much I have one
here and so I just wanted to ask
about the revenues in the taxes
at Representative Armstrong mentioned
that do we have
numbers to so I have given
have an understanding of
how much the
state is able
to
generate.
What the revenues look like but
the taxes on those
revenues.
Madam chair representative
I don't have those
numbers I think based
on the revenue that we have
and the excise tax you can get a
pretty good idea
however you know one of our rules
is to
you know make sure complaint actors
taxes is something that I I'm
sure folks are interested in the
little outside our jurisdiction
but I can get those numbers
for you thank you so
much. Thank you
and and any
answers or anything that you'd like to
provide more further information you can
go ahead and send it to Erin and then Aaron
will send it to the entire committee
so I do appreciate that
Representative Gallegos David
Representative
Duncan.
Thank you
madam chair and thank you panel
this is been excellent
information in fact they have
tons of notes here
and the tons of questions
but I will I will respect
everybody's time
here.
And I guess you know I'm hearing a
cut some
scenes
and and part of the team
is you know we were in
a we were working
towards opening up this
industry and
are happy that it's working in so
many areas
but I but I think
here and when we were
in in Clemente Los
crucis we we had the opportunity
to to our one of the
biggest facilities
in our district
and that we're very proud of and
watch how at
what a top
level does
right and then we're
hearing some of of what are the
bad actors are doing and
so I guess there's a lot in between
there and so part
of.
What I'm really hearing
is we
have oversaturation.
And we don't have the
compliance piece
to stop
the bad actors and
so I'm a little concerned when I hear
that well we have some
suggestions over
what needs to
happen
because.
In in my brain I if if
we don't get our arms around
that we're going to hurt the whole
industry.
And so I think
that.
And and trying to get to a
question.
She limited me to 3
so now I got these all floating
in my head but so
I guess I'm I'm
so if we don't
have the teeth
to stop bad actors
doesn't that then just
put the small business people
that we were trying to help in the
first place out of
business you know
I hear that you
use your life savings you
left your good paying job
people are are doing
all these things to make sure the
industry works
but if we don't put up
legislation.
So number one maybe put a
pause
on
licenses
I think that we really need to
look at that and so we can get our
arms around it because and I think
that puts the whole industry
at risk
can you respond to
that.
So I guess
from an industry perspective
I see
that issue in
some of the like the
course CCD related issues
in terms of sort of empowering them
I see those is needing
to be a lot stronger than
just simple
suggestions things
need to happen with
that. Granted
though I do think it is like
deeply deeply
important
that any sort
of moratorium on
licensure
is extremely
carefully considered
and that see see
these able to do a really
in depth analysis
on market by
market where
exactly the saturation
exists and then make
decisions in an informed
way if we just
tomorrow put a moratorium
up I think that that fails
to consider the
deeply different realities
in these different towns as I
said you know there are
places like Red River that
have 0 dispensaries the
testy valley has 0
dispensaries angelfire as
one if
we.
Cancel out those opportunities
immediately without sort
of considering the
fact that these places are not
Albuquerque in the market is
not yet developed
I think we have this market is
existed for roughly
not even 18 months I
think it or about 18
months this point it is
not settled everywhere
it is not like
completely developed and
at some sort
of
maturity across
the state it may be in
places like Albuquerque to
house Los crucis some of the
bigger population centers
in may if I can hit
a threshold but
there are still tons of small
communities around the
state
where there will be
no access to product whatsoever
if you just shut it down
tomorrow so I
might my feeling is
that we really need
someone knowledgeable
to complete that analysis
before we just close this off
and we need to consider the idea that
these moratoriums are definitely
temporary
so that once again it
doesn't cost $500000
to buy a license a year from
now. And
thank you madam chair I appreciate that
the response
at any rate we don't want to have
a knee jerk reaction to that
but I also think that there needs
to be the ability
for the for.
For the regulators to be
able to say okay we
have an over saturation in
Albuquerque and so
the being able to
decide where those
licenses then
go and
also are
we looking
at.
Those businesses
if if they're gonna be re
issued licenses
are we looking to make sure they
pay those taxes are we
making sure that they're good actors
I mean that's part of making sure
that we have the
the good the
good actors rise to the top
and you know being able to say we're
not going to be issued to people that have
been a bad actors
thank you
Madam.
Madam chair representative
yes we currently checks tax
status to ensure
these folks are are in good
standing during the renewal
process at application
they have to register as a
cannabis business
agriculture's we do work
with TRD to ensure
that they are
registered and then from the tax
ID TRD handles
that thank you
and.
Madam chair
representative and
I'm very thankful so this
round we just renewed our
license we had to submit
a letter of good standing with tax
revenue department I was
overjoyed some people are super
bug because they have been
trying to you know that's one
P. 6 kept the cash
flow up by not paying their taxes
and so I was thankful
that that was reintroduced
in those are examples of things
that the CCD could
choose or choose not to do and
thankfully under
the new leadership
that due diligence is being
done and so I think in
addition to adding some of the teeth
it's you know using the teeth that are already
there it was probably
staffing the reason that they
stopped and so keeping their
staffing up making sure that money
doesn't just going to the general fund
but that the department gets
what it needs to do it needs to
do is going to be
huge so I do
see a lot of these things as you know
possibly even fixed you know even
some of the worst issues
there are you know
that Department powers
that can limit that like revoking
licenses you know it's like you
may not be able to go destroy the product
yourself but that
we as producers have SO
peas for quarantining
ensuring product we
also have recall
processes so
like some of these bad actors in Missouri
they got issued statewide
recall and these
products are made out of state additional
it had to be brought back that
punish the retailers
financially and so
now that give them incentive to do
the due diligence that this
gentleman myself do
with our retail stores we don't
shelf this type of product because
it puts us at a
liability as long
as the liabilities worth it
the risk to reward ratio then
that's going to continue to be
incentivized but
even with the powers they have now I think
we continue to Whittle
away since
in spirit we're all committed to the same
goal and I think
you mentioned I appreciate that
and I
want to ask another question but what I
will say is I would
really push you all
as the industry
and as the
regulatory
arm to come up
with legislation that
really needs to happen because
and I know if you've if you're in
conversations with the governor
and you know we need
to move things forward because
I think another year
this will only hurt the industry
some more so
when I hear you know these
are our recommendations I
think we got to be a lot stronger than
that so thank
you madam chair thank you
panel. Great
thank you representative Duncan
and Representative Zamora
and by the way as
Representative Eli and gets ready to
ask if there
are comments that you're not able to get
to our responses you are
always welcome to send that to
Erin and she will distributed to the
committee representative
Duncan. Thank you madam
chair thank you
for The presentation I'm not in your
camp the state that right
up front as a former
county commissioner when
Colorado opened
up there's I saw what
happened.
One of the biggest things we don't have right
now is I don't have the ability
to give to my
share of the
breathalyzer and say that guy
just killed 2 people
what caused.
We really put the cart before the
horse in my opinion on
this until we can
offer our law enforcement what
they need to make this
right we
are way before our so
having said that I'm
not ready to pick winners and losers
in this fight.
There there are contractors
they're plumbers or electricians
they're tile years there's
also to folks who don't
operate with a license out
there right now currently.
And what and we don't offer them the
same protection you're asking for
us.
Today so I'm not
ready to legislate
protection for you and I'm
not willing to do for anybody else in the
state thank you madam
chair thank you representative
Duncan representatives more than
Senator Ortiz Y. Pino and then
Senator
Gonzales.
Thank you madam chair and
I'd like to ask the panel how many of
your producers up there or
have have a cannabis
business
that are yes
fine.
To show
support okay I did I
just wanted to get that
straight.
Do we have
any.
Fax servers
yr's information as to
how much
when we know how much we're selling
but we don't do we know how much
sales how much
each person on an average
spending the the
buyers how
much they're spending on on
cannabis.
Maybe per month or something
like that I know I know you said
you had some lot
information sitting in
your.
Stuff papers there
but do we break it
down on a per person
how much are using
to so
we as new Mexicans and
legislators can go
back and
and you know
we've faced.
Problems in the past with
with gambling
and responsible
gambling.
We have it with liquor we
have it with
other things are we
looking at that for the health of our
community.
So you can get general
per capita numbers and I could
find those
on
you know at a later date you
cannot however
specifically say
this person has
spent this amount of money on a
product you get
into you know
the.
Privacy rights of someone
to be able to
purchase cannabis especially as
a medical patient without
being able to disclose how
much exactly they're using
so you can get a top line
per capita number and that's
about the best you could
do because otherwise it would
be quite an invasion of
someone's privacy 10
and madam chair and and thank you
for that would not
I think that would be very helpful
to the state in New Mexico and us
as even the
regulators so that we can see
if we have an issue we have an
addiction issue if
somebody's using it for medical
purposes are they
getting are they getting
addicted and then over using
that we've had that and in
other medications happened in the
past and not I'll
get off that our and I'll go
to another.
I carried a bill this past
session to put
cannabis backed
on the contraband
list.
And it's.
Probably not your problem
but it's a problem a problem that the
cannabis industry has
created within our
jails
it was.
Whether accidentally
or or
whatever taken off the the
contraband
list.
And it needs to be put back on the
contraband list
because we
and I'll give you an example
in
what you in the Baca
County we
had a person
smuggle
cannabis into the jail
and highlighted in the in
the bench seat
there in the front and
then. Her
boyfriend or husband or
whatever.
Was given duty to clean the
jail stuff because he was such a
good in may but
then he knew she had
placed it there and and he got
it got a hold of it so they
were getting high in the jail.
And then it goes
to it goes to court and
the DA
couldn't prosecute this
person.
Because it wasn't on the contraband
list.
So it's just like having bubble
gum in jail
so.
I don't know if it's any of your concern
I think it ought to be are
the concern of our
legislators
and the people here in
the sit in this committee.
That we need that back on the
contraband list.
We can have it in our jails
and and expect our
jailers and.
Our people the the take care
the jails to
to have some kind
of control on the on
the inmates
so madam
chair of I'll finish up with
that even though I have 100
questions and then
thank you thank you
presenters.
Committee thank you for understanding
about our time constrained I certainly
would encourage you to write your
questions down you can either item
on the pieces of paper just make sure
your your handwriting
is legible and Erin will make
sure to get those answers for
you so I do
appreciate that Senator Ortiz Y.
Pino then Senator Gonzales
and then representative Allison will finish
it up thank you very
much madam
chairman and and thank you
for especially for the legislative
recommendations I think
all of them are absolutely
defensible and I would hope they get
into some
kind of a
legislation
that we can act on this year
because this is important
we get ahead of the
2 things that you didn't mention
though that I wanted to ask about
one.
We shouldn't we also be reducing
the tax to make
it much
more
difficult for the illicit
market to to
be
a continuing and the
second thing is shouldn't we also
be reducing that
emergency
20000 plant
limit that
you didn't ask for read
reducing that and it
seems to me that those big those
10 big providers
those 10 big producers of the
ones that are that
are.
Basically controlling the market
in making it very difficult
for these a small
smaller businesses
to survive a
committee chair
Senator short
answers yes we should be
reducing the tax the
baby step is reducing the
escalation for this 30 day
session and to
answer your second question
the emergency rule that
upgraded the plant count limit from
10 to 20000
plants I just rolled
into the the regular rulemaking
so that can be changed
via rulemaking and
doesn't need legislative action
and that's something that we
are discussing and the
the industry will work
on. Good
thank you madam chairman.
Thank you senator Ortiz Pino
Senator Gonzales and then
representative
Allison.
Thank you madam chairman
of I I
won't have any questions I just have
a short comment
enough where I'm coming from
is some I'll be
starting my 20 ninth year
and the legislature this
year and of
this are the things that
are. You know
I have seen
happen.
And one of the things
that I'll I just like to mention
is so probably one
of the best presentation so we
had was a couple years ago when
we're doing a lot of the liquor
part.
And it's
very interesting
that when you say the high
price you know
if we limit
and he goes into a very high
price and selling license
or transferring.
Is. A
license is not
an entitlement it's a
privilege.
And as he was mentioned
at that presentation.
Every single license
including your driver's license
and. Fishing
licenses and any
license that is out there belongs
to the state.
You know and we always should
keep that perspective the you
know it doesn't turn into
a property right which
wants to put that high
value that's
the interpretation is I paid
300000 so it's
mine no it's never
years that's an entitlement
you know so it is a
privilege the other
part that I want to mention
is set on listening to our
conversation and this is not
a one of my regular
committee some attending
here today just
being from towers.
Is
so.
You have just entered the hardest
part.
Into what is going to be going
into this
part.
And where what
I mention on this is
so.
In 1995
we did a repeal of
$0.6 on the gas
tax we could never
get it back.
I mean it's it's just really really
hard
after that you know there
was legislation to
introduce charter schools
and this is not for
against charter schools
the same same problem
happened was there
was no limit to the
number of charter schools that
could go into a
certain area
and so you start facing
were everyone is fighting for
the same students and for the
same dollars in
competition is
you know you welcome
that but at what
expense when it starts hurting
the other program
and I'll give you an example
is when I was superintendent here
Intel's we're close
to 4000 students
the district today is a
2200
you know and then it's the rest
of them are into charter
schools so now
you compete for capital outlay
you compete for everything but
you still have to pay the bills
for lights and the
utilities and everything that goes
with the building
now.
Just going
into the legislation
part and you mentioned the bad
actors
you better believe that those bad
actors will be out there lobbying
very very very hard
you know and this is what I mean
is just it's just starting
now so you
know with the recommendations that you
brought up and you mentioned
today the
sooner the to work on those
the better because as a
lag on from one year to
another year he just
almost becomes very very
hard and this is one
of the things that I have seen you
know through my experience
is that once we pass
legislation
it becomes really
very tough to
correct you know
because then you're working with
both chambers plus you still
have to work with the administration
so you know again thank
you for your work that you're doing that
I'll at the same
time this is the time to
correct it the sooner the better
thank you madam chair if if
I could just really briefly madam
chair representative
for clarity sake you are not
able to transfer or
sell cannabis license
it's not like orphan alcohol
licenses you can
transfer or sell a
business page with the need to
reapply for new
license.
Madam chair I understand that
perfectly the other part is
that this
people would end up purchasing
in the eventually don't
feel that way and you'll end up
in litigation.
You know and just from the very
beginning you know it's that
we need to work with that us
on an understanding that
it's not theirs it belongs to the
state.
Thank you thank you
Senator Gonzales Representative
Allison here the last
question
today thank you madam
chair thanks to the panel
for the presentation
I have a lot of questions as well
but some of them have been answer
but one question that hasn't been
answered is
madam chair is
since since
you control cannabis
sale statewide.
Shouldn't you be required
to contest to control
untested products
that are available in the gas
stations.
Chairperson Representative that's
a great question
in 2018 the
farm bill made it
possible for the hemp industry
to sell
to sell products that
have a higher potency
of THC so hemp and
cannabis are the same plant
the only differences hemp is
bred to have less
THC cannabis is bred to
have a higher level of THC
so in order to
be have it has to
yes I think below
point 03 percent so
what happens is if you
get a bunch of hemp
and if you
the squeeze it together and
extract that you can get
high percentages
of different types of
cannabinoids that have intoxicating
effects this is a
federal issue the way
that some states are responding
is by outlawing
hemp derived Canemah noise
and that's been faced with a bunch
of different lawsuits
of the way that other states are dealing
with it is there bringing in
hemp derived
teach the drugs into
their their cannabis program
so we absolutely
should deal with that there is
not a mechanism right
now because
we're talking about something that
was made possible through the
federal farm
bill.
Just as a
side note to that I
spent years and years and
years in the hemp
industry kind
of in between
different cannabis
ventures and
I would say that
I very very much support the
idea that
CCD
had that kind of rolled into their
jurisdiction or that
there were some legislation
about it because
those very very untested
drugs as someone who's in
the industry and did a lot of
testing that I did not have to
do
our.
They can be
absolutely
terribly diluted and
safe mode the
full of
harsh chemicals from
extraction
and I
I would absolutely recommend
that those things are
provided I don't think
that since the city's power
at the moment though.
Okay thanks for that answer
madam chair I would think
that because anything
that sold
under the title of cannabis and
gas stations
is presumed to be under
the jurisdiction of the
CCD so
I would think that you should have control
over that thank you madam
chair. Thank you
Representative and thank you committee
for honoring
the the time that we
are
presenters thank you very much for being
here and I know that we will continue
to have conversations with
you about this because
you can tell this
committee is very invested in this
and we all
want this to be a success
will most of us I don't want to
speak for representative Duncan he's been very
clear about his stance on that
but I I think
recognize the opportunities that
we have here and wanting to make sure that
they do right by New Mexicans
so thank you very much for being here we
appreciate in committee thank you very
much I'm gonna go ahead let
you go because we want to make
sure that we have our
next panel up just
as we're trying to catch up on
time
we have an hour set aside
for this panel
and then we will have
lunch but we
will work through lunch
just because of the time that we
are sitting I do see
questions coming so if you do
have questions for this
panel make sure you
give those to Aaron
she might have to
have you clarify your
handwriting but if I can go
ahead and have Ramona Kelly
Jeff and Peter come on
up.
And so we are
going to now have a panel on
indigenous filmmaking
and I do have to
confess that I'm I'm kind
of fan Girling right now over
Ramona because I did
hear your interview on
NPR and then I
downloaded your book and listen to
that and my wife also listen to
it so we're very excited
about that
and and so thank you
for indulging me I
do have to be very clear about
that panel I was just like
we can talk to
her
but also I think
what we are seeing
is a
long overdue
a rise
in indigenous present
representation in our
media and
you know we're we're seeing in New
Mexico with dark
winds
we're seeing with reservation
dogs we're seeing
a lot
more.
Legitimate
representation of our indigenous
communities in our media and
so we have
Ramona Emerson who is the co
owner of real Indian pictures
Kelly buyers also co owner
of real Indian pictures
and we have from the gonna pueblo
Jeff key my saying that
correctly hi
okay names are important so I do want
to make sure I get that Jeff
hi owner of Jeff CHI
productions also you receive
the pencil word my correct on that
congratulations and
then P. Romero who is the stage
manager at camel rock
studios and
so thank you all for being
here today and thank you
for being
able to to help our
indigenous communities
get those faces out there that
need to be out there so I'm gonna
turn it over to you I don't know
if you're gonna rock paper scissors who gets
to speak
first.
Okay.
Jeff if you want to go first
you're ready to go you need
to push a little talking person
there.
What's the madam chair and members
of the committee and I'm
just so the A. out on those the
quick then
greens my name is difficult I
come from
gonna pubblico bitcoin
clan little turquoise plan.
I have my master's degree from northern
Arizona university
I'm a filmmaker
small business owner
in the state of New Mexico
with the help of the Senator
Pinto filming
filmmaking award I
have achieved these
milestones
since 2020
receiving the award
I film feeding propane
which is part of my master's thesis
film has been
selected for film festivals
won the horizon award at the native
American media awards
I helped a local organizations
such as table women
United the native
American food sovereignty alliance
traditional native American
foods farmers
association
of also been The Washington DC with
the young farmers coalition
and also working with public
excellence.
This year my film was also selected
for a culinary diplomacy
program.
Now with the James beard
foundation
so as a representative of
us I was one of 2 chefs
that went to
France and we
worked with the US state
department and French government
right. Serve the
whole dinner with them ambassador
friends Denise Bauer
in that ambassador's residence
in France
so that was an amazing
opportunity.
Also work with the James beard
foundation with other chefs
and policy programs advocating
for the farm bill
that's because I submitted my film
for your the James beard foundation
as a as an ode to
food and they really accepted
that.
That message and
then it inviting to the
programs.
Despite these made major
accolades there are still
major barriers that limit my
contributions
to the
economy is
public in a government does not
have adequate resources
at for graduate small business
owners and our regular
citizens we
also need more capable governing
institutions
to help our citizens as well
in that sense I'm trying
to break the cycle of poverty
this includes getting access
to land which also would
be.
Creating those other businesses
that would go along
production
equitable systemic changes
and also economic
opportunities my
next milestones would be operating
a major production studio
are creating innovative projects
includes our indigenous youth
and elders.
Creating an immersive culinary
experience highlights are PED in
reference for the New Mexico
lands all of these
me so many economic
criteria such as agro
tourism cultural
to tourism film opportunities
and sustainability which
I think is very important
with my international diplomatic
travels I'm ready to bring all of those
experiences
to the state of New Mexico
overalls and indigenous small
business owner I like to advocate
for more programs
that bring our indigenous
scholars
home many of
do not have the networks of
support that I had
when coming back to my
my home the
village.
And also as we as
we saw with the WGA
and SAG
strikes in the entertainment
business we see
the external factors can
put a halt to the New Mexico
film production so
diversifying and creating independent
production studio houses
and investing in and
indigenous production
houses can keep
production moving without having the
Holtz of a major
Hollywood in New
Mexico native
a native of filmmaking money
is also leaving our communities
to because you don't have
access and resources available
and are sometimes not
affordable and we have to go
to either Albuquerque or Santa
Fe.
A couple things I learn a
month my travels as
that are indigenous
cultures are being welcomed in
Europe and that creates a lot of cultural
exchanges that leads to more culturally
Representative tourism
I think would be
very.
Intangible I've
visited one of the largest international
markets that could be an example
of how we manage the Mexico based
foods and share with the world.
Much to that
sharing our our goods
with the the world
I have participated in in as
international discussions on food
security New
Mexico can turn
from food desert's to food
force and we think we have
the potential to do
that. As you
can see a multifaceted
individual yes I'm a
filmmaker of amounts of a
chef entrepreneur
and that's the story for many of
our public people in business
people and I
support
as many native businesses as I
can and I'm looking forward
to visiting by since our
the Lucian store here in PTA's when I
get a chance to I
really thankful I'm really thankful
for the the chair
chairman and members committee
for inviting me to
speak and uh
Clemente thank
you.
Thank you so much I'm going
to Google you and look up your
stuff.
Of thank you Ramona you
wanna go ahead go next.
Sure.
Something is going on out
there thank you
madam chair thank you Representative
for having us
I really do appreciate that
and thank you
for enjoying Center
I appreciate that
I am here as
0.5 of real Indian
pictures we
are in need of own production
company in Albuquerque New
Mexico and we've been in
business for almost 30
years we
mostly make documentaries
I'm I'm that I'm gonna
have you pause just for
second
Representative Ortez that's a
funeral that's going on outside
okay.
Of for fallen firefighters
okay so.
Oil oil just so that
folks can hear you as
well.
Seems like the sirens have passed
so if you don't mind going
forward thank you I'm my apologies
for interrupting please
go.
I am on 0.5
of really Indian pictures
we are able native own
production company in Albuquerque
New Mexico we
work closely in documentary
films but we
also run a production
company and so we
have a lot of clients here
in New Mexico that we work
for you know we work
for I a
I a the state of New
Mexico the Navajo Nation
Navajo tech
just a we have a lot of different clients
here in New Mexico and also around
the nation a
lot of our work
has been
really the bit begin
by funding through the state
of New Mexico
we were one of the first recipients
recipients of the the governor's
Cup when that was
began by governor bill
Richardson
and because of
that funding and because of that
support we were able to
make a film what one of our
first funded films
everything to that point had been are
self funded films
so as a member
of the governor's
council which I am I've been
a member for the last
4 years I
advocate for native
communities to be
included in the film industry I
think there's a real lack of
connection between
a pueblos the
Navajo Navajo tribe in
the Apache tribes about how we
can afford them the opportunities
that are afforded to the rest of the
state when it comes to
bringing productions into
New Mexico
there's no real
need for
funding
for support
and on our tribal communities
to get them involved in like they're
having a new screen it's
being brought in and built
in Albuquerque at the train
at the old train yards
and there has been
no discussion between that
that's entity
item like Navajo tech
for is the San Juan
college people who
educate native
peoples and that
community around the Navajo
Nation that's why there's no
opportunities for jobs
there's no opportunities for
educational
outreach to get them
involved in
filmmaking there's. A lot
of jobs that could be done by people
in the local community like in
Shiprock when there was a production
there but instead
productions bring outsiders
into our communities and
they are the ones that are afforded the
opportunities and the
jobs and so as part of
the governor's council that's really been
a huge thing that I advocate for
is like why are we having these
discussions with tribes
and why are these tribal communities
being part of this not
only in the educational part but
also the job opportunities in the
job training that they're they're really
touting and so I feel
like there's a needs
to be a better balance between
the fact that we're representing
or that we're giving so many
tax breaks and opportunities
to the production companies
and the big productions that are coming into
New Mexico but
we've almost lost every
single bit of independent
filmmaking support that has
existed in the state of New Mexico
there is no more governor's Cup
there is no more
there there used to be and an individual
loan requests a different things that you
get through the Film Office to fund
your films those don't exist
anymore and as of
last year we also
lost the since the Senator John
Pinto memorial
fund which
I I really hard
alongside Senator Pinto to get
that money and we only
it was only $10000
or $100000 excuse
me but it afforded
10 filmmakers or 20
filmmakers to
make their films
and that is a huge
impact with just that little bit
of money and so when we went back to
the legislative legislature the
next year and we
asked for more funding to continue
this program they
acted like they were gonna give us
$3000000 and that we were
going to expand the program to not
only indigenous filmmakers
but also makers of color in the state
of New Mexico the under represented
communities around New Mexico
and it just never happened
it just felt the ball was
dropped
and I would have
been there if Jeff's been
there those those meetings
we would have been there to speak up
for us to speak up for the
local filmmakers
because I think there's a real lack
of opportunities for
the the home grown people who
live here not the big studios
they're getting all kinds of stuff they're getting
a. Kinds of taxes and
tax breaks and subsidies
but they have seem to forgot
that they're supposed to give
back to our
community we give them those
tax breaks so that they can
help fund things like the
John Senator Senator John Pinto
grant so they can
afford a new governor's
Cup a new way
to give support to
to independence
so far for me
that is what I think
it really needs to be
addressed.
Thank you for money create
the.
Okay here we go.
Start spreading the
news.
Okay I'm gonna kind of
I'm just going to give you a point of view
of the as a observer
because I'm not from here
I'm from Oklahoma originally my
my tribe I'm
talk to offer mobile home
and I got here I'm
I'm I'm kind
of the outcast
if you will I I
the public to do Navajos but
again you know
precedence over over over me
because I'm I'm an outsider
so anytime I
get funding and what have you for my
filmmaking aspect I have to do
it from the outside
mash the
National
but for here just as
a as an observer
there is a lack of connection
between the tribes and
the film industry there's a
big lack
connection
and unfortunately
yeah what Senator John Pinto
grant that was available
a lot of these little
filmmakers flourished.
But then they kind
of painted because
there's no more support for
them. And
to be surprised
how do these kids with
the women when we come out of
school
the only mothers looking for this
this this break in the
industry and is not
available.
Mainly
because.
There's nothing out there for them
and and the and the native community
really it there's a
beautiful studio over that
camel rock but
I don't think they have like a
school set up
there for
native
youth but
that's kind of where I you know I
I I am with our company is
I I enjoyed teaching
you how to make
films and documentary
in particular
and we
we we use our own
funding to do this
and we've been doing it for years
and but you
know there are times where you do we can
do it as a job like
we work for
I I I ask
and we made films with children
with youth and we were
paid for that but
other than that we do it on our
own and
that's what I would like to see is more
you know opportunities for
these need kids coming out of it
because it in a lot of
the mainstream they do
when they come out of your Academy
of whatever what the
what the film degree they get they
get pushed right into the
industry right into the honest
that but a
graduate from like I a I
a for example.
They come out they they don't have
anything available there's
nothing further.
So I I there's a there's a
connection that needs to be made
and and then you know
championed and and
faster and
if you guys could
you know make something
for that that would be
beautiful.
Thank you.
Thank you
computer research center
yes madam chair and
thank you for inviting me
I feel their pain
I felt their pain for
years prior
to being with to Sookie Pueblo
and building the stage manager of cal
rock studios
I hit the ground running
with universities SantaFe
university of art design to prior
college Santa Fe
did a $20000000 renovation
Garson studios
well there the department
chair Chris Harris who's
a very
well known actor and
producer with dark
winds of smoke
signals and some other
products hospitals and work
with Robert Redford.
Listen I've been beat really good
friends for many many
years we parted
ways hi on my way
to I I worked there for
6 years
and speaking to these guys I've
seen the struggles of the
students
from Navajo tech
from San Juan college
and I I a their film
production it started out with photo
ID 6 weeks in its
expanding now to
film. But
that's where it stops.
I think a lot of the students
don't realize what they're worth
this
from any trade
art is art and every
very medium
but just their
cultural they're not so
what we're going to kind of
our reserves
and it's it's
it's a shame because the students
when they do crack that shell and they
get out of the industry they
have a story to tell and a unique
way that I don't think anybody
understands is less who are
native and this you are from
these lands and
it it really
really hurts
me
as the stage manager
at council rock you know
we've had 2 major productions we have
paramount and we current have
AMC.
We've had were the world's
most recently dark
wins we do have
a lot of American and Americans
employed either
as.
Behind the scenes from the Cameron
for back of the camera
contractors and so
forth but I think
what hurts us as an
industry especially the
first native American owned and
operated film
studio.
People to render facility are not
eligible for the tax
incentive.
Which really hurts
us the reason why it hurts us
is that we have to price
ourselves so much
lower
to be in line.
With other
studios.
So were
I'm just these are just for profit
years I'm not quoting any
pricing Garson studios
friends their facility
$0 a month
I'm gonna do for
35001.
Because the people running
it are going to get that incentive the
tax break they
can get incentives on building
materials a
lot of these people the
industry is focused
and built in Albuquerque.
So they're paying the money to come
up to our
studio they got to
pay for rooms
guests all of
that's. They
can get reimbursed
but the facility itself
which serves the
public to suki
which then
gets back into the wild and
routes that are systems of they can
help their people with their
health care with the
internet the senior
center programs they have
transportation feeding
the seniors
helping them with heating
bills.
Water relocations just
everything that happens there
it just really
puts it back down why
are we a bill to get the
tax incentives
it was never written the legislation
any read about speaking
to our our panel
here we get this
money and it goes
away.
I've seen the producers a flan on
Monday to flat on
Friday. The
people that actually live here are
the ones are we're making
this movies on their back
but that money doesn't stay
here it's not routed
here. And
it's concerning it
really is an industry
my earning power
at the studios really
limited because of the tax
breaks.
I bring students and
from the to suki
day school Oaxaca is
a lot of tribal schools I
I
Dr Philippa Cologne for
my I am but the
students come over we give studio
tours you see there
on ice.
While one day I could be here
John McLendon who is the
second producer one of the main
actors I work with him
first when he was on
Longmire at
Garson studios
he is a huge proponent
I mean I taken over the day
school these kids
can't believe what they're seeing with their own
toolbox and
just to see them incentivized
to be able to come in and
say I could work your tail
I just had a young gentleman that
worked at the.
Plant.
Northwest he got laid
off because the vote
closing the well
he's literature I
tried. His
trade segue to ride
into the film industry.
Because electricity is a big
part and kids are putting the
correlation between
blue collar and what to be done in
film everything's you're an actor you're
making the keep film in the camera
there realize it takes months
of construction
painting
so much post production after
the fact these
people understand that but the
thing about it there's no school
or outlook for this to get
to the native communities to
get that voice out to on
and in kids in general
I mean that's our
future Senator she's going to die
unless we re
stock are used
in a segue to an industry that's
here is rooted here and it's going to
stay here.
You know Oklahoma
the nation there I think is a broken
over this is going to build a
huge I think it was
$35000000
soundstages.
Their incentive from their state
then delineate between
sovereign nations native American
or other to
them they're all citizens of the
state they all get the tax
incentive so
for me being you know a
resident in Mexico within the film
industry working with native Americans
every day it's concerning
why are we.
Limiting the
earning power the
fact that we can reach out to
New Mexicans native
Americans across the country
I had a gentleman from
northern Wisconsin
come through he wanted to use the
soundstage for one day
for documentary
and basically only wanted to do
was just put 3 chairs
and do a Q. and a with some
lighting.
And he said you're the only one who talked to
me you actually answer the phone
and call me back.
Because right now with
every stage unless you're making
huge money they don't want
to talk to you.
Armada's different I
don't think a lot of people realize for
me to come here today and talk to everybody
in this room I had
asked permission from the general
manager.
Chairman my board and
more importantly my governor
without that I can still
work out of respect to the people
into everybody and Representative
so when Erin you know I
emailed me I said I
gotta ask permission
that permission could take a
day an hour it could
take a month I'm just
glad I was able to come here because there
is a story need to be told
not everything's you know
glamour and grit
on a film stage and
these people work amazing
hours there's no 8 to
5 I mean when they're filming
Darklands I know some
other night scenes they start at
dark and they run to 3 in the
morning and they don't care if it's hot
cold snowing or not
that's our job they
get paid for the
job they do not by the
hour. And it's
it's really concerning is really
concerned that we're not able
to benefit from
the same benefits
everyone else's and I
realize you know
we're the public helical
for capital outlay
I really don't see a difference
between a tax incentive for
film.
Using.
A film studio on sovereign
nation.
Then we getting capital outlay money
to replace here
to me it's the same thing and
it's not just more so for the Pueblo it's
more so for the production companies,nd
because I can raise
the money rent and we're generating
revenue for the public
and that's my job and
you know it is to take care of
that
and then you know the
everything right now with the
strikes independent
filmmakers works at if
I cannot rent it to a major
production because of you
independence where the money
is and it's not even about
the money it's about
native Americans helping native
Americans and at this
point you know us being the first
and the only one actually production right
now this speaks volumes
and I think we need to look
at that and get the incentives in
line so it's equal
playing field for everybody because
right now we're starting out with 2
strikes.
And if we don't.
Do that it's it's
it's it's detrimental
to the the amount
of money that I can generate to
sustain the business.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you so much and I
have to admit that I'm I'm on
the very last episode of Darklands and
I don't want to and so I'm kind of
like slowly going through
it.
It got picked up for season 3
with some
I do appreciate.
That what you're sharing with us
and and to give you a little bit of
history this
committee is already we're going to be
hearing some
legislation
to see about this committee endorsing
recognizing that
on the Navajo Nation for the DNA
people that there's
no real roads
that were are allowed are
servicing the community
solar shortline
railroads
are not able to bring products and
goods and services in an off
and so we
want to help make that happen and
and I've I've so share this with
this this committee before that I feel
that are our job is the
legislature's kind of like a board of
directors is like to support you
in what you're doing
and to get out of your way so you
can continue doing what you're
doing and
then if there are issues that we
can help with that that's our
job and
so
I am going to
make a formal request from you
if I may
2 if I just if
you could give us kind of top
priorities of
this because I think those are
things that this committee is
demonstrated and and recognizing
that there are been barriers systemically
put in for tribal
communities for.
Many many years
and it is
it is time to to remove those
barriers I think
and so I
would really like to see what we can
do and especially
you know it's unfortunate because
there's been a great deal of work
done by our indigenous
people for many many years but it's
just the recent things you know
with Chriss with with our
plans and the partnership
that he had with Robert
Redford.
And so I I think we we
really need to kind of capitalize on that
now because more
more people are not paying
attention. And
and I'm sorry the people haven't
before.
So I do have
Representative Duncan
and if I have any other folks
who want to ask questions.
I'll be more happy to entertain
that
but representative
Duncan Europe
thank you madam chair
I wholeheartedly agree with the
panel and thank you for
presenting we
should be giving breaks
to our local folks that
we're giving to California companies
or anybody else for that
matter.
I'm not in their camp is
that a nice way of saying it madam
chair all right I'm
not in their camp I mean your
camp and you should get
every break that that locals
to I'm I'm for
that can
you. And
I don't know who can answer this question but
can you tell me why you're not allowed
to get those tax
breaks.
Yes because once over
land.
So if you want to Garcia studios
and rented Garson studios.
You would get in tax incentives
and rebates
because I'm a council rock and I'm on
summer landed to secure
pueblo you're not
eligible.
Madam chair is that just because you're in
the state of New Mexico.
With federal I believe
federal but you're in the state
of New Mexico and we're we're
we're right on for 3
miles north of Santa Fe
in Santa Fe County
okay. Yeah and
and what's so amazing that
I I couldn't believe
is that the no matter what
you do to your house that you supposedly
own are you thank you own
on on the reservations that
sovereign that
belongs to the federal government
and whatever you do there's
no equity ever
so no matter what you do to your
house there E.
never develop equity
and I found that
astonishing and so when
you ask these questions about how
why is that that way
this the federal government that has
hurt them upon us.
And we're smothered
by.
Literally and
and then there's also
the as a
small business
you industries as a
small business as well
as running a production
company you don't have
time to
write to get the paperwork to
get it together to get your tax
break for that 25
percent of the tax incentive
that you get back for expenditures
in the state of New Mexico it's
impossible the things
that you have to do the hoops you have to
jump through and the things that you
have to do in 30
years of make of us
to making films in the state
of New Mexico we have
never filed for the tax
break incentives not one
time because we don't
have the resources it's
the 2 of us running
camera and editing the film
and doing everything and then they give
you the stack of paper they
say oh if you want
25 percent back of
the rental cars and
hotels and whatever else
expenditures that you did in the
state then you have to fill this
huge stack of paper out and
then you have to wait 2 years probably
down the road before you even get them
because there's more all
the all the juice goes
to the big studios in their tax
breaks and they get everything first and
then we get everything later
we tried that we were
denied yeah they
just they just keep
that there were so many paperwork
issues but I was just like
okay just keep it
because it was just too
much and so just as a
small business owner
and then on the if you're if you're
a business owner on the tribal
lands I don't know how it is in the going to
but I'm and the Navajo Nation
it's hard to get a business it
takes years
so by the time you get a business
you've given up on it already
you know it's like why so
you end up moving you have to move to
Gallup we have to move to Albuquerque or
Santa Fe just to run your
business you can even be
home can be
home and and run your business
and on your tribal land
because it's they don't give
you the tools to do it
neither the tribe's nor the
state.
Madam chair
representative.
All rescue for in the
tax incentive is just an
even playing field
that's it nothing not nothing
special just the same
tax break that anybody
else gets that's on
rentals building materials
fuel
lodging I'm in all
of that they get incentive
to get tax breaks
if you rent outside of a
sovereign nation since we're the only
native American owns
of some stage for studio
in New Mexico
we don't it's not a point even
playing field all rights case for the
same rules and I
think that's fair.
And there's a there's a
real need for more sound
studios in the state
there's if we we have
way more productions here
in New Mexico if we had like
10 more production studios
and why are they
putting production studios on the Navajo
Nation why are they putting a
big big productions
studio that the public can run
on this site on the west side of our
state or down south like
there's so many areas and so many
different
the server the different communities rural
communities could they could get
jobs that could really have some
development if they built some
stages in their communities it
doesn't all have to be in Albuquerque and
Santa Fe there's no reason
for that to be limited
but you know that's that's another
thing we talk about of the governor's
council is why isn't that
half and even he
even in Albuquerque and Santa Fe
they're not building more sound stages
so we're losing productions
everyday because there's
not enough space for these people to
film that.
Thank you madam chair.
Madam speaker and committee
as I mentioned before I I
feel like I'm living like a real life case
study my sense because I
went to college I got my masters
I returned to my public so
and I've been
met with a lot of backlash
because of all the things I'm trying to introduce
to the public so not
in terms of like advancement but these
job opportunities and
economic opportunities
that I tried
to.
You know it give advice to my
my tribal elders
and tribal leaders
but again there because
I'm not in good standing with the
tribe
for whatever reason even though I left
my committee to get my
degree
they say I have no input our
state in what the matters are
diligent till they deem
myself
in good standing with the village
and so that's what I mean there's no capable
governing institutions
and and also
my professors is
in the fight and indigenous studies
8 and so I mean it's like a real
life case study of like
as a young person coming back into
my community there's no resources
for those there's no avenues even
if and be really
great to have like a state
supported system to bring
our indigenous scholars that
come is it and
not just in film but like our
doctors are are
professionals are sciences
you know like everybody that we need
to have in
our economies
of those they're
not being supported by our and
tribal
introduce our our our
leadership and there's
multiple instances within my own
government and we're gonna Pueblo
that they.
They cannot are not
capable of running these
institutions
in progressing them at the state
that at the rate that we need
to and that's what I'm trying
to give my a
real life
story and and
and also it's it's in
it's in our community of filmmakers that
we keep supporting each other that we
keep
fostering that creativity in
instance putting each other so
that's it's it's it's
coming together as a community to advocate
for ourselves as as a as
a person in
in our creative study
so that I just wanted to
echo that because
it we need capable governing
institutions and
and sometimes
it.
The different tribal
leadership in different facets
not just the immediate tribal council
or the governorship but just within
the community there's no
avenues for our
tribal citizens.
To make it a really large impact
that they feel is is necessary for
them.
Thank you madam chair so
there's a couple things.
I'm a small business owner been
a small business owner for 40
years
is there help with the
film film industry
office madam chair
that that they can go and get
help with tax prep is my
first question and that's probably a question
that we can answer today and
second.
As far as federal government we can do
a lot about that are you
asking the federal government
for help in this
matter.
Have you reached
out. Oh
no.
We have no I have not reached out at
all of that just to try
believe have tried to reach out
but what was the I'm sorry
what was the first part of that
question tax
preparation hello yeah as
a small business owner
though I've
I've gone to great lengths
to to find people could
answer my questions and help me with
the stacks papers right
and and so
there is no such person at than
at the New Mexico Film Office there
used to be The New Mexico film
office right now is super
understaffed
and part of
our advocating to the
governor this past year was
advocating for at least 3
more staff members for them
one of them being a tribal
outreach person who
works with tribes and the film
the film office and then
another person that was going
to be helping people
with the the
tax break incentive with
helping with paperwork with helping
with incoming productions
because basically they have 3 staff
members in there that just to
everything from running the
everyday of the office too
lobbying to doing all the
committee meetings whatever they
do and
there it's just it's ridiculous
so you can't.
And there's a very
few
accountants that you can
talk to who do film industry
specific accounting
that know the ins and outs
of that particular tax
incentives and how it applies
to your production so there's
a there's a lack of people that know
have that knowledge but there's also
there's also not a staff member
in the New Mexico film office that
does that specifically.
Madam chair representative I
think the misconception is there a
film offices in every community
state city
county there's lots
of film offices out there Santo
has their own the state
of Mexico has one in Albuquerque
has one
but those film
offices primarily
are to get big
industries
into the studio.
The outreach to independent
filmmakers and
others does not
exist I've seen
that first hand we
actually had Santa Fe we actually
had to Mexico Film Office on the campus
and if you diversity of our
design for several
years right across the street from
our studios
but their primary legal
was to bring economic
development into the state
and that federal all too
large studios
so Santa Fe Film
Office Gen
works there she's been
very helpful
with getting us
at the studio to come
rock in
touch with different production
companies and
its stock but that's
the exception not the
rule. Thank
you madam chair thank you madam
chair I know this committee
works very hard at at
removing barriers to help
folks and so maybe that's something
we could work on
thank you can thank you
representative Representative
little.
Thank you madam chair and
thank you members of the
panel for this information
and I'm very happy to hear about
this a
2 year your
story today and
your experience that you've
been that you've had
over time
it's been my pleasure to work with
Ramona on different
projects and I'm
very happy to hear that you
know if you're looking
to in large to grow
your business to grow
the film industry not just for you
but for
others in the state of New Mexico
especially the tribe's
and madam chair
one of
the.
One of the questions that I had initially
was.
Whether whether
there were restrictions
against and acting
tax exemptions on tribal
land with filmmaking I
didn't know about it
I'm rather new
to this arena so
if there were
it could it possibly
have been that
there were no tribes that
have were in the industry
at the time that this was
create legislation was
created and if
so it may be time
to revisit this and
I'm very encouraged by
the idea that
Oklahoma for you gave the
example
did not
chose to apply this
just across the board to
anyone with
that in mind though I
want to
took a look at the process
but it's also with
keeping in mind that tribes
are sovereign governments that they are
going to choose to decide
they do have
the
final say in determining
what's going to come on their
lands the exciting
part is that more tribes
that I'm aware of
have been used
to have been their
tribal lands have been utilized
for filming
for
consumption says of
construction
for
workforce to come
in to help them
help the studios and
help
the industry in this
process
so
I
would.
Like to
check and see I'm
not quite certain about the
process to do this
but.
To see kids seems madam
chair
and
Mr.
Romero.
Has taken that first
step it would
be very
important for our to
seek you to have a voice
in.
Examining what
other states are doing that
have
filmmaking on the
industry on their tribal lands
are they getting exit
exemptions if
so what were
the barriers
that might have existed before
what are those challenges that
we might anticipate moving
forward and
I'm hopeful that it's not going to
be as hard as it was there
but
the other certainly is not
to impose this
also on tribal
leaders for tribal governments
but to make it
available as an
opportunity it's an
opportunity and I think
over time
as a problem
myself I am
very familiar
with
the.
Perspective
of
of
of.
The taboos against photography
I will say maybe that's a better way to say
it that existed
and there were reasons for that
and there still are very good
reasons for that but as
time is moving on as
things are evolving as
opportunities
are
created.
I think that there
are.
Opportunities for
jobs for training
for all of these pieces that
I think that it would be
of.
Something worthwhile to
pursue
and.
I'm sure I'm not exactly
certain.
What my quick how to
formulate my question but I think
my colleagues have already started what
can we do how
can we
work
to.
To address this and
equity.
Is for did a
I'd be willing
to lend a
hand. Thank you
madam chair not sure what's quite
a question is it was a
statement.
Representative thank
you for that I think
you are correct when this
was designed there were
no native American
owns some stages.
I think this is an oversight on
stickers look at in the Ford
but the vision of the Pueblo
is also not
just for
the studio itself
so much economic development
it could happen
within custodial
needs
security
landscaping
of the tribal
lands themselves
and the part of the highway
if you've ever driven through Pojoaque
to suki the
west side of the road is
tribal the
east side of the road is that the
development corporation
that's how the delineated
so for me to
actually get permission to film on
the Pueblo itself.
On the tribal
lands.
The process could take
months the reason being
is as you well know
I've got to get tribal council
like at the governor I have
to have the president trouble
preservation officer go check the
lands for sovereignty for
for spiritual and and different
types of of properties
so you know when they should
delineated the
actual
development corporation
side it really
loosened up to taboo she
spoke up because it's
a designated piece of
property that has been
cleared.
And and that's really
helped and we have standing
sits there for dark wins
with the permission the blessing
of everybody
involved so
those those those barriers have
been taken down this is
the biggest concern is
that we are
unable to compete.
With the same rules the
rules are different for us
and that's all we're asking for the
same incentive because
you have a production company
that. Given the
same square footage
yes the same price will here
again incentive in here I
don't I think
we'll know the answer
and we have to
lower that price
significantly which is
earning power of the
Pueblo.
To be competitive and I think
that's that's that for me it's
for it's very disheartening.
Thank you madam chair Representative
thank you madam Mr
Romero madam
chair the only
other.
As.
Concern that I would have
would be is
taking a look at the
Film Office
to establish
it appear at
it's clear that there needs
to be some support additional
staff members there
what will it
take
in order to do to
have that happen I think this or have
been some groundwork laid
for that but
staff that's a
support staff
tribal outreach and
at least one technical
support which could be used
I'm sure and the
same type of position
an increased number of
them to
support the
the rest of the communities that
are getting into this industry
as well
I think that the opportunity
finally closed madam chair
with I
think that the opportunity
for
Economic Development is great
on tribal communities
I was at a
forum earlier this
week.
Gosh that was Monday
and talking
about the
opportunities for
those that remain in our tribal
communities we do
want them there they play an
important role there's no
reason why they should if you choose
to stay there that you
shouldn't but to also
have needs that are
far different now than they
were 50 years
ago.
Even when I was a child you know
and so
the opportunities are
coming around
we're.
Gaining experience I think
tribe I will say we
as tribal communities are gaining
experience and and now's the
time to come at I
appreciate the
presentations this morning
and the thoughts that
you've also given me to consider
so madam chair with
that thank you very much.
Thank you so much Representative
Allison. Thank
you madam chair.
As I listen to the
panel I don't
think I really
understood.
What you're asking of this
committee was
or if you're even asking us for
help so
I agree with the recommendation
of madam chair or
if you would be right at
what. You
think we could help
you with that with
would really help so
of I'm all
for economic
development especially on the
Navajo Nation yes
that's why we're working on the railroad
together so
if we could bring feel make
and as an
economic development
on the nation
we would generally support
that.
My only familiarity
with the
few Macon is
working with a gentleman by the name
of Rosie hi.
It does is
make Senator fumes and
introduce she'll make an
into the high schools
and the students there are making their
own short films
so I have
given him some junior money
but I'm willing to
work with the Senator
Pinto and
you of
of this person if
we can help you in anyway I
just need to understand
where and what I can help
you with. Thank you
for that madam chair.
Thank you Representative and and I
think you know we'll have a
great deal of respect for
Representative for Senator
Pinto and let
her spirit and her fire
and so I think you're
continuing to have those conversations
but I I do feel
that there is a genuine
desire to help
remove the roadblocks we've
we've had those conversations in
this committee before
specially for tribal communities
in recognizing that there
been systemic roadblocks put
up for
many times and some of those that will
we're gonna have to figure out a way to navigate
around.
That I think we have a
creative people and passionate people
in the state who want to do
that and
understanding the frustrations
also that you
know I I wanted to say a couple of
expletives when you were talking
about just some of the things
that the federal
government.
Prohibits from
happening.
Yes please something madam chair
yes
yeah I would
also.
I have to really really ask
that you voice
the the
exclusion or
inclusion if I may
of the the
school the native schools
the colleges because
there are wonderful programs going
on for that main street
but there's no
inclusion of any of the
native colleges
well I appreciate that because I'm thinking
you in southern New Mexico
we have the creative media institute
and there's the the next
generation Film
Institute.
And I'm wondering why
we can't have
something like that that is
recognizing the
culture and the
history
and the customs of our
tribal communities why we
can't have something like
that.
That would be working with our
studios that would be working
with filmmakers that I know
that you are just like
yes I want to continue working
with our young people and sharing
with them what we
can do in the state and
and I commend you for being
able to do to make
magic with such
minimal
resources
that you have been provided so
thank you for that remote
I think you want to say something
yeah thank you madam
chair as
far as the opportunities
to go go and I'm I'm
I am still
very
upset about the whole tax
thing but I really think when he's
talking about this education
more important for me then the tax
stuff is the fact
that there's just though
the lack and I think a
good example of that especially
for representative Allison
is the fact that we had
a Jew Manji filmed
up there in Shiprock
and
there were no natives on that
set there were no Navajo is working
on that set we could have
had Navajo drivers we could
have had a Navajo
carpenters we could have had
all kinds of different Navajos
employed on that set and to be
part of the industry
but they weren't they all came
from Los Angeles or they came
from other places and
so the Navajo Nation
lost out on that but
what what worries me
is that place like
San Juan college where they have a
film program and there are
there are probably more Denis
of filmmakers than any other
tribe up there there's so
many did the filmmakers
and why are and there's
a bunch at San Juan college
why are we getting
them involved in the and a set
like that how come they were given
an opportunity to be a production
assistant or to be a writers
assistant or to work
with the camera or to do
whatever it is that interest them at
that they dream of doing
this because there's a lack of
communication
there needs to be a thread of
communication between
sits between
colleges there's a
whole room of
computers and
editing software in
a dusty room
at Navajo technical you.
Diversity that has not
even been set up for use
because the students
don't know how to do they don't
know how to use it because there's no
one to teach them
there's no studio there there's
no film department there
they had there's probably
10 film students who are
majoring in film at
Navajo technical university
and they're basically on their own and they
share like to
cameras.
That's the problem for me
that I see and that's
why you see these
these big productions getting
all the tax incentives they
should be giving back the film on
the Navajo Nation they should
be giving back money
to run a training program for
Navajo students to come from
Navajo tech or to come from San
Juan and be on
that set and to learn hands
on how to work on the sets in New
Mexico.
But that conversation just isn't
happening and I think so
I think really
one of the things I am asking you
guys to do is to think figure
out how we
can communicate
with tribes educate
them on how all the different
implications that are involved it's
not just taxes and so just
making money it's
educating and
giving all
our dreams back to our young
people. Because
that's what it is if you don't film
if you don't act we show
them that it can be done
the bill just forget about
it and they'll forget about their
dream of doing whatever story
telling they wanted to do
so that's where goals
ultimately more than just
the tax incentives it's like
you want all those tax incentives
and you want to come to our communities
and and our communities
of giving so much attention
to you it's your
turn to say Hey
we've been filming in New Mexico
and using all of these communities
and all of our all of our
workforce let's get back
to these tribal communities that
we that we film
on by supporting their
young people by
supporting their communities
by hiring by
hiring people who are doing
catering on in Shiprock
instead of bringing in an outside
per firm
that's the kind of stuff that we're
asking for so more
than just the tax incentives is
really getting them involved
and and giving young
people something to look forward
to and giving not just young
people but a community
something to have
something to be something
tangible to be part of
internet to earn money
you know and to be part of that
that economy of the film
industry that's all
it's it's.
I just address me crazy I think
of that computer room
being used and I think for
many of us that's like that's a
disgrace that that that's
not being used and I
think
you know I I appreciate
that the the really
the encouragement of conversation
and communication
because
you know we've had the Navajo
Nation president at the
capitol
and I think those are conversations
that I think many of us who are
not members of tribal
communities would like to be support
staff to
help support
the desire that the
tribal communities have
and so that those voices are front and
center
and so I I do appreciate
that and and I don't mean to
put more on your plate but if
if there is an opportunity
to kind of like
what is your wish list
yeah you know and I don't and I'm not
I'm not you know speaking
empty words because
I do feel that this can this committee
is genuinely wanting
to support those opportunities
to remove those barriers
and so I'm not just talking out of both
sides of my mouth
here on behalf of this committee I think
we all are and so if if
you don't mind
to do that and then send that
to Erin and I think you know
representative Allison and
Representative little as members
tribal communities here
you know how can we help
support you.
In getting these things
done and I think making
sure that those connections are made
because we're all still working in
silos right
and that doesn't help anybody
when resources become thinner
and thinner.
And so if if we
can help pull that together and
from a government perspective of
making sure that money
the conversations now or that that
money needs to be
sustainable.
You know that we need to make sure that
the programs that are invested in
our long term and sustainable
and for me when we invest in our
own and we keep money in our
state that sustainable
and that is you know keeping
people from leaving their homes
which we know for many of
us and small communities
having our young people leave our
communities is
heartbreaking.
And when we have young folks
who cannot make a living
where they grew up
that's a failure I think
on our part.
And so I think we
we need to do better and
I think that the people on
this committee are are committed
to doing better
so thank you so
much for your time I would
love to like come up and shake your hand
and just then I need to do a little bit of housekeeping
really quickly.
We do have because
I totally I'm fan Girling so I
hope that's okay I don't mean to make you feel
uncomfortable
but but.
