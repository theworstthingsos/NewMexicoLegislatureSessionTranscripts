Thank you ma'am chair members of
the community good morning
house bill once in the four is a
one hundred thousand dollar
preparation to do a feasibility
study for a national museum of
new deal art i'm joined today by
michelle galger roberts dc a
deputy cabinet secretary so let
me give you a little bit
background about this in twenty
nineteen the house passed a
memorial there's a copy on your
desk there should be
asking the congressional
delegation.
To look into a national museum
of new yard located in santa fe
and I am says national so i'm
not proposing a new state museum
the new deal was an incredibly
productive time for art.
And it was a national program
this idea is that this is being
national federal museum we
passed this memorial i've had
individual meetings with number
of the members of our
congressional delegation they
all express uh great interest in
enthusiasm and then nothing
happened.
So here we are
for five years later and in
order to move this idea forward
what we need to do is there's a
feasibility.
With secretary or see great and
she a dca
basically agreed to shepherd
this study.
The.
The new deal in was a big deal
in new mexico this is public art
in architecture in new mexico
this whole book is about new
mexico published fire our own.
This is when art worked the new
deal.
By roger kennedy
roger candy was a.
This is something that.
Hugely important in the art and
archdictor rural when it
happened but they had a really
big impact on new mexico.
And what I envision why would
like to see happen.
Stop my background this to me is
economic development.
This kind of museum would bring
in new visitors to new mexico in
which you could do if you if you
look at this list of where some
of these buildings are.
Wherever the museum was located.
People could come in they could
see the art
they could learn learn about the
programs.
And you could send them on
driving tours of new mexico you
could you could give them a map
of where all these buildings are
looking at it and maybe in the
rest of their visit or maybe the
single purpose of their visit
would be you know to go visit
other places in new mexico.
And it's just so it impacts the
entire state.
The the memorial specifically
called out the park serious
building on museum hill.
And i'll know if you're familiar
with that museum that the same
museum with that bill.
The.
It's a jungle mean building.
It's got you know five foot wide
walls.
One museum.
It would be perfect.
But also belongs to the person
service
and they might not want to part
with it so one of the things
them.
One of the things came up in my
conversation with the secretary
was we should evaluate as other
locations.
Both in safe and outside the
campaign because this museum
doesn't necessar.
That's why the feasibilities.
Take them.
The.
Members of the committee i.
Um.
I am the art person so.
I will give you a little bit of
background about the new deal so
new deal is a generic term for a
variety of programs administered
by the US government from
nineteen thirty three to
nineteen forty three for artists
in new mexico and throughout out
the country these programs
include the treasury section of
painting sculpture the public
works of art project the works
progress administration which is
the most well known program the
federal art project and the
treasury relief art project by
nineteen thirty six more than
thirteen thousand people in new
mexico alone had found jobs
through these programs artists
created works of art in a wide
variety of forms murals theater
fine arts music writing and
design while others worked for
the w k built schools and other
public buildings you'll see a
lot in post offices
in including the library and
administration buildings at the
university of new mexico in
nineteen thirty four the federal
government began loaning or
allocating the movable artworks
created under the new deal art
programs to public agencies and
nonprofit profits throughout
the.
Largest new deal.
The general services
administration is the federal
agency that is responsible for
inventorying these loans are
works
most of the movement will art
that was created during this.
Conducting a.
For embarking on the creation of
a new museum these studies often
include reviewing pet.
Building.
And donor and fundraising
landscape.
No manager.
The.
The.
Yeah.
And uh it's not currently in the
budget I had have had
conversations with
german small about it
and I am working on trying to
find it through the enough
junior money
so that that might happen as
well
chairman's small suggested it
would be a good idea to run the
standalone bill to get it on
their rater as he put it
so i'm hoping that to send this
bill to appropriations and then
we'll figure out whether it has
a place in the budget or if if I
can get it done through the not
junior money that I will p.
Chairs.
I see that you know put the
would put them.
That you said it was.
Memters and trusses the merle
was in twenty nineteen uh the
sponsors were myself then
represented if you golf and
senator worth in the reason the
three of us sponsored it was the
moment calls out the parks of
his building which is in uh
their district work worth in
so they correspond through it
with me.
Manager.
Uhm.
We don't see this manager mister
chair.
So not sure represent it really.
Um.
The.
And so
you know I know that you're
considering work to places.
The bakery.
You know really.
It is a definitely a.
Anyway who's going to do the
study replacement
memters and trust us for suffer
on your location idea I love it
you know
I mean the person was building
is his unique but as I said it's
belongs to the park service.
Initial indications are they're
not willing to give it so we're
looking for another location i'd
be happy to take suggestions I
have a couple.
Um in who would do the study
presumably and r p would be let
you know and they would hire.
Present.
A federal.
What is what value.
Yeah.
Like.
I didn't.
That is the cultural
department they had this process
you know so many packs.
The.
The.
The.
It is a good idea
I have no problems.
Then slow the process.
The.
The.
The artwork the movable artwork
is owned by the federal
government they are they have
positories or they have loans it
out to
public institutions or
nonprofits across the state.
Managers
one of the things I want
emphasis is that the proposal is
for a national museum a federal
institution so to the extent
that there's millions of dollars
in you know whether you're
building a building or restoring
historic building it can be
expensive I you know it's very
clear to me and I mean it
cleared to the sector i'm not
proposing that.
Wanted to federal
institution that the art is
owned by the government so we're
not gonna take it away from them
so much as we're going to
provide them a place to display
it.
Yeah.
Why.
That's like.
Reps
chairmans had me one the terms
the
roberts has used movable art so
there's a lot of this
they're painted on buildings you
can't move it so so I actually
have them
have maps.
New deal are in mexico and
there.
There are three maps because
there there's three different
regions and there's there's your
already information where if you
want to see this art in the
local community it will tell you
what post office has or what
school building attack and that
art obviously no one's moving
so so like that sort of to me
what really appealing about this
not only as the economic
development aspect was that they
would impact the whole.
The.
Hi horse you know in the needs
of the state.
Museums that that sh.
Member service and cross is not
the.
Really l.
Who would it then.
Ma'am tear ribs and throws us I
think with a study in hand.
We could go back to her
congressional delegation and if
it was if it was promising and
feasible locations and
visitation and economic impact
you know to me this is this is
an investment in.
His lead tourism
then we could go back to her
congressional delegation and I
think we would have more.
Success in getting them to to
look into this as a possible
federal project.
Ma'am chair like I said the
beginning i'm not in arca I mean
I like her to but
at yo I I feel the constant need
in the legislature to work on
economic development.
Thank you ma'am chair thank you
members of the committee.
We are on.
We're good yep.
Representative.
Good morning madame chair and
members of the committee I am
representative pamela heard it
and i'm actually standing
conspirace of the legislation
house bill eighty two but today
representative gale armstrong
was not able to be here so I am
standing in for her and see
that's a good thing you can see
that this is a bipartisan effort
and it's one that's going on
really well so the new mexico
historical women's market
program this bill focuses on
that program it has come a long
way since an initial
appropriation in twenty in two
thousand and six which funded a
process for identifying women
whose important role in history
has been overlooked so historic
women markets began appearing in
two thousand and seven and now
nearly a hundred of those
markets are throughout the state
legislative funding in twenty
twenty two helped establish the
tools and partnerships to move
the program into a new phase
where we educate inspire and
empower people of our lagest by
promoting the united unique
accomplishments of women in new
mexico history and the phone
establishing the program is
needed now to expand it more
there will be a great
promotional and marketing
campaign preservation and
archiving of the things that are
already in place and then a
primary and secondary education
program to make sure that people
around the state not about all
the great things that women did
things that I know that each one
of you are looking forward to
learn about in your libraries in
your schools and in your
community centers and so madam
chair with that I would like to
introduce my expert witness i'll
let him introduce themselves.
I don't give me madame chair
members of the committee i'm
patrick moron the chair of
history and heritage for the new
mexico department of cultural
affairs.
No matter I would just say we
would stand for questions now.
Yeah.
Opposition.
Not so much a question just.
You know it started.
Madam chair representative mason
that is absolutely correct thank
you represent.
Quick question the.
The market about.
Where are they installed are
there buildings or they are.
I will it madame chair
representative to roses i'll let
my expert explain that manage
our representative yes you
probably have seen these new
mexico has a very dynamic
historic roadside marker they're
the ones that are are put in by
the department of transportation
and actually they're all
overseen by the closer resources
historic preservati.
Identify they research them and
they put them there so if you've
done the road and you see them
on the side and run from what
the historic marker was those
are the markets that they're
doing so many chair
representative I was.
The.
So which ones.
Madam chair representative these
would be updated and so one
going to see or not so much the
bronze ones like you might see
on a building but the ones that
are are laminated in their metal
sometimes you see them and
different are if you see one and
disrepair you can always report
that to the department of
transportation or let the
historic preservation to.
And they also update them
there's arison with the use of
the ones that are the large
wooden w.
I'm chair that those while where
I was going with my question is
so is any of this money.
Or is it for new mor.
Madam chair representative I
believe these are offering new
markers there's other.
So these would be updated ones
that are continuation on the
proje.
The.
So the
always ask if it's on the budget
and i'm just gonna both and
then.
So is it in the budget.
Madame chair representative to
rises I am taking the position
that it is if we look at the
fiscal impact reported says
their dca department of cultural
affairs does not see a a
impact in moving forward with
requests with request of the
appropriation as but for a.
Deserve.
More than others.
Manager representative they've
been very aggressive on
identifying statewide markers
and and highlighting where
those.
Executive to r.
We highlight.
Women who have played such
important roles across the
entire state of the mexico s.
Medanter representative
we have sixteen and that they
include against morely cleveland
either make fierce and morally
so that so example and I can
give you the whole list but I
wanted to hear.
Thank you madame chair and thank
you members of the committee.
The.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think you matter chair and
committee house joint memorial
one
essentially is asking for a
federal delegation to help the
nab honation and sound on county
to be able to create
a real
system
in san want county on the nab
reservation
over the last couple of years
madam chair we have uhm
seen a number of uh
very good paying naba who.
And part due to
the eta
uh the with the closure of a
call mine and a power plant
around the nab honation prior to
that a couple of other power
plants and call mines have shut
down and so it's had a directive
and then over an arizona as well
on the nab honation there have
been a couple of other
call mines and another power
plan that have shut down all
within the last five years
those were all
economic based jobs and uh
frankly the
if you listen to arbitrary heal
reference who works for the.
Uh
navigation president and the
office of the vice president in
economic development he's he's
coin the term that the
comments in power plants built
the naba whole middle class
those jobs were down to one
power plant one call mine and
san on county and that's all
that's left on the nab who
reservation
so uh in coordination with an
abonation
the
trying to identify.
A new economy that would provide
economic based jobs on the nab
who reservation which would be
nable preference.
What what has been identified is
uh in someone county if you look
at a map of the nation.
There is a great big hole.
In on that map where there is no
rail no interstate and no
commercial air.
And that is in that greater area
between in new mexico and
arizona.
And the nab honation right in
the nab honation is the center
of that.
And so it's hard to
build industry without that in
our connection so in connect and
coordination with an abhornation
we came up with this memorial
we're having local investments
going into this
i'm asking a state to get
involved with the effort.
And what this memorial is doing
is asking our federal delegation
who.
Interconnection with interstates
and rail is a is a commerce
issue
that the the nation should
be interested in and what we're
asking him to do is to help us
with the building of this
infrastructure
representative allison who is
one of our co sponsors cannot be
here is in another committee
today.
And the nabonation president
will be here on the first and
he'll be making the rounds to
both the house in the senate are
there a couple of bills this one
in this joint memorial and th.
Another bill that's going to be
in place.
We have something that hasn't
happened in a long time and that
is
the the aligning of the stars
between the abhonation president
the delegation and the local
community and uhm.
Uh.
This
house memorial joint memorial
has
the economic rule development
committee during the interim
heard this and it gave it the
committee.
With that matter chair I have a
representative dunkin here and
he'd like sick.
And good morning matter of
chairman committee as the mayor
of the local community
and as those at power plant was
my mind shut down the amount of
people a left art community was
tremendous most of those being
native americans are schools
have seen a tremendous uptake in
grandparents raising.
Ccs.
This is a
this would be a great shot in
the arm for the middle class for
the native ameri.
Thank you matt.
You need to be out in the.
And this c.
Yeah.
Real road.
Yes good morning madame chair
members of the committee
my name is heel and i'm
one of the senior advisors for a
president hybrid
here in the office and the
present vice president I do want
to stress that this project is a
very important project as
indicated by representative on
toya.
Tremendous economic drivers are
beginning to be shut down on the
malcolmic.
And right now we're looking at
how we can begin to diversify
our economy
and how we can begin to look at
revitalising our ability to
bring people back to the nation
the railroad here would be a
tremendous foundation from which
we could build not only within
the new mexico portions of the
reservation but also in the
arizona and you top portions
given that that the railroad
would terminate in the
forecorner to regions giving
access to colorado arizona and
utah
so again I would urge the
committee to to support this
we will be providing more
more formal support before this
ford is endeavour but again I
just want to think the committee
for hearing this
representative montoya for
moving forward with this effort
along with that representative
thank you venture.
I.
Thank you.
Thank you representatives of
being at this point a statement
also because.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not that i'm a free guy but.
This.
Really good for your.
Thank you madame chair
the reality is
all products so we have right
now and so in county we are a
regional distributor we have
people that come into farming to
the shop that's the only thing
that has saved the entire c.
Our regional distribution
centers so madam chair are just
a bit of indulgence on this this
is how this is why the nab who
nation has gotten on board with
this in particular not just the
jobs themselves but the reality
is if the transloading facility
is on the nab nation all
products coming into the
community and all products going
out.
Would be then transloaded and
the nab who nation would make
money on that so the reality is
all vehicles.
That are coming in to our
are on our car lots those are
coming in on undiesel trucks
being hold in trailers all of
those products we have a we have
two super walmarts in
informington we have a sams club
in farmington
all the products that are coming
there now are coming by diesel
truck and it's very hard on our
roads actually that is another
thing I have we have talked
about the environmental aspect
of this but this will cut down
on diesel being used in san juan
county for all of our products
going in and out to the rail and
at the anything that goes to
rail in that I believe it was a
twenty four to one reduction of
diesel that is what saves money
as well the cost of fuel the
cost of all that so all products
everything that's distributed
sound on county would be coming
in on the way out besides
the nappy in the past we've had
industry there when it when the
cost of fuel wasn't so
expensive.
Lays has looked to be there that
is one of the partners of
nappy because they provide
they've they provide a awesome
big spired potatoes but we could
then bring in industry.
That would be that would be
manufacturing jobs to go.
That's fantastic.
That is already in the works we
have this has been a a process
to try and get this project to
find we've we had a study that
was done about five years ago it
was a feasibility study now
we're at the beginning stage of
putting gather a and
environmental impact study.
And those studies are are
required for this to go forward
so really the timing of this now
it's taken as well to get here
and we believe we've done
everything up to this point that
is needed that study will be
provided to the feds.
And everything that they're
requiri.
Yes.
Thanks committee.
I'm looking at about.
Thank you thank you.
Good morning madam ch.
Presented a bill here some very
much looking forward to
this morning I am pleased to
present a house bill one seventy
seven the new mexico match fund
cosponsors of this bill include
representative scale arm strong
and susan here as well as
senators pete compost and pat
woods so you can see that we
have great by partisan and vik.
For decades and for a variety of
reasons new mexico is lagged or
neighboring states in securing
competitive federal grant
dollars whether it's a lack of
bund capacity for grant writing
or a lack of funding to provide
is a federal match these things
have held us back but over the
past several years the
legislature in the governor have
worked to break down these
barriers first we set up a
federal grandspiro at DFA then
we directed funds to cards to
build grant writing capacity to
help our towns villa.
Two years ago we appropriated
one million for our communities
to use as match funds
then one year ago we
appropriated ten million.
And we have seen the results.
Eighty five million dollars.
Returned on that ten million
dollars investment we have solid
data that shows the return on
investment and how these match
opportunities can be
transformational for counties
across new mexico not our urban
areas but our smaller rural and
frontier communities
now with the dated worth these
efforts are which is
in front of you and I handed the
map of new members
but I don't have the ten where
those funds have gone to each of
your counties
i'm in a record amount of
federal competitive grants
available now is the time that
we must ensure that our
communities have the resources
to compete and achieve a
tremendous return on investment.
At this point in time I would
like to introduce my expert
witness reback arouse rebecca
serves as the infrastructure
adviser for governor lou hung
grisham and she's going to walk
us through are the key
mechanisms of the bill.
And I will also introduce wesley
with dfa who is also an expert
witness here on hand from the
department of financial.
Thinking out of chair members of
the committee thank you
representative dickson for
leading the way on this bell I
just want to emphasize a couple
of additional points about this.
And the idea that we hold
together many ideas that we've
pulled together including
lessons learned from past
experi.
I'm so couple of you thinks
about how funds
available in the new mexico
match fund would be able to get
out into communities across new
mexico at least three ways that
these dollars would flow from
DFA managing the fund out to
entities across new mexico one
is matching federal grants so
simply when a federal agency
makes grant funding available to
enter to use your new mexico and
there is a match requirement for
that sometimes it's a wonder one
match sometimes it's ten percent
or twenty percent it ranges
greatly
by in in many instances that
requirement for that entity here
in new mexico to put up matching
dollars is a barrier that keeps
them from going after those
dollars it's not necessarily the
only barriers for a lot of our
communities but it is one key
barrier that we're addressing
directly in this bell the second
way that this fund would enable
dollars to flow from tfa to
communities and state agencies
and tribal governments is throw
a providing project
administration funds to the
entities so in addition to
availing themselves of the match
dollars needed to go after that
federal grant and entered you
that also applied to dfa for an
administration grant
supplemental to their match to
help them manage the project
this is very directly intended
to help communities get projects
completed so that they aren't
just pulling in funds getting on
a ward from the federal agency
and the match money from dfa but
they actually have the ability
to hire staff I are a project
manager hire a grand.
Those federal and state dollars
effectively and that they get
their project done the third way
that funds in this bill would be
able to flow to communities is
to offset higher project costs
that can sometimes come along
with using federal dollars and
many federal agencies and and
federal programs require
entities using federal dollars
to buy american made products
particularly for construction
projects based on the fact that
we're still building up our
domestic manufacturing a
rebuilding and growing our
domestic manufacturing here in
the us sometimes the bolts and
screws and steel there you need
for a project costs more from us
manufacturers so the project
overall project cost using
federal dollars can be more and
one provision in this bill
that's unique um to what we are
produce proposing here new
mexico unique compared to what
we've seen other states doing is
that entities could apply to the
fay for to offset that higher
total cost of a project that
comes along with using those
federal dollars on these are
three different and distinct
ways that communities and
entities could use the smatch
find to leverage more federal
dollars into the state of new
mexico which is really our
ultimate goal
and what also just a couple of
more points on how it would work
and one of the ways in which
this makes our communities in
new mexico more competitive for
federal funding is by setting up
a fund at the fay that would be
managed on a rolling basis
throughout the year this makes
our communities more competitive
for federal dollars cause they
can apply for the match dollars
exactly when they need it if
federal grants deadlines come
all your round not just on our
legislative cycle and so
communities that have a federal
grant deadline of august first
they could apply in june or july
two dfa.
Have a quick and nimble process
to get that award and be well
positioned to compete for those
federal dollars by having a
grant commitment from dfa in
hand for those match dollars
when they apply for their
federal funds
and the last point then I want
to know as
representative dickson mentioned
we passed out information about
how the ten million dollar
appropriation DFA has been
managing this year and how many
entities that I have benefit
from that forty different
entities benefiting from that
across the entities is two
hundred and text
hundred million dollars and
imagine the ground period do you
have any opinions out this
question.
So as I was saying the average a
match grant a word that dfa has
administered over the past six
months or so is two hundred and
fifty thousand I am so well that
we expect there to be a
significant amount of demand for
these matching dollars we are
also expect with the initial
infusion we're seeking of a
hundred million dollars that we
would be able to support many
deverse entities across the
state of new mexico and all
thirty three count.
Yeah.
Manager wesley billingsly the
local government division
director just add on to the
thirty three counties
recommendation you know we have
administered
lots of different application
based on appropriations in the
past and I think one of our
goals is to always make sure
that these awards and he's
appropriations get to all the
communities throughout the state
so i'm that is something that we
will definitely look at i'm with
this funds to make sure that all
three all thirty three counties
are representative receiving
these funds just wanted to add
that.
Thank you madame chair.
You got micro
great thinking members of the
committee my name is michael the
young.
First of all I want to think
representative.
Because.
This bill
starts to address some of the
fundamental areas that
particularly world communities
are facing and being able to
act.
As has already been said there
are tremendous opportunities and
a lot of resources that are
there.
I've spent the last couple of
months talking to council
government directors.
About just some of these buries
and they're they're really
tremendous communities around
the state of really swimming
upstream.
So I just want to also.
Folks in the local government
division like.
Leadership not to mention the
local leadership communities
about the state and their
administrators hertz that are
really doing a credible work to
get as many resources
communities and management of
interest it really is a huge
challenge so really just want to
encourage your support of this
bill we think it is a critical
step.
And and really just.
He mexico oil gas association we
support his bill because this
investment of state funds will
unlock several friends.
The act will help me.
Can you go.
Good morning
my name is come which you know.
And act.
And also the funny that's
contained in the bill.
But also increase access.
The leaders great.
Projects.
So.
Leave the.
And the percentage of serv.
Why.
Yeah.
Yeah.
State.
Many of our people you know are
very concerned about a
diversified con.
And th.
We don't have the capacity.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You have a lot of different.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You are forestry division the
community well part of things
grant program which does require
a match from communities and
that is one of the re.
Fired.
Knocked down dragon line
for the albu.
On both my sports legislation in
time you can leverage federal.
It's important uh this is roads
to energy and pick frankly
economic development and
diversification or something you
really need to worry about
especially over the next ten
years well guys prevented the
great but leveraging well I
guess.
From the feds is a no brainer.
Yeah.
We never.
Not enough matching.
Yeah.
Carmen.
Foundations.
Requirement.
Lovely second director for the
office broadband.
The office brought in has been
tracking about three billion
dollars.
Find that as all of these
programs that come out I j
or are
the inflation reduction acts
yeah come come to you to bear in
the state that more and more

in twenty twenty two twenty
twenty three we were a coport of
justice forty part of the bited
administration's effort to make
sure that low income and
communities of color get forty
percent of federal resources and
although we were given much a
support to be to increase our
access to federal funding one of
our challenges became in twenty
twenty three when we worked with
bernaldio county to apply for a
two million dollar US DO t grant
how we would be able to help
support matching funds house
bill one seventy seven would
help to address in support this
to make sure that most impacted
communities like boincoming

able to work with local entities
like our counties and
municipalities to be able to
apply for justice but forty and
other federal funds please

supports this people legislation
in twenty twenty two the office
of the state engineer can be in
a water policy task force with
fate agencies and water experts
across the state and one of the
recommendations from that report
was that the state create a fund
that could be used for federal
matching dollars we think that
this will go a long way at
hopping mobile communities build
up projects for water resiliency
which is something that we know
our state desperately needs so

Here for all the work.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The.
Thank you madame chair think you
representative i'm gonna go
ahead and have our expert.
Manager representative lewin and
then the gold tent of the
administration fee is to and how
higher potential f t
help administer some of this
funding as well as to put
appropriate systems and place to
be able to track the funding and
make sure that we get all the
data and reporting to the
legislature into the governor's
office that's needed you know I
think this is going to bring
lots of funding to the state and
so we want to ensure that we are
be able to report that to
everyone in appropriate.
Adam chair representative lewin
I think you know we have to see
how how much of an impact this
is going to have to the
communities I think i'm seeing
how many requests we get
throughout the year what kind of
help dictate and how many you
have to ease we will need to
hire throughout the year I think
the start of obviously we would
need one to get the program
going into the program off the
ground and as as we get more
funding into hopefully this fund
in future years and it might
require more and more fte help
track and and get the funding
out and and help administer the
program so I know that doesn't
give the exact answer to your
question represent everyone but
I think like it want to start at
least and then you know going
there at fifty after fiscal
year.
Madam chair representative we we
actually have four fte requests
for local government division in
our budget and those for fd's
are to help administer the
couple out they grants i'm in
our community i'll make euro to
possibly on hire a new budget in
finance bureau analyst to help
with our nine one one program
who hopefully will be overseeing
firefighter funds or some
correction funds and also for
rural and equity ombudsman
position who is also requested
some f t throughout the course
of the last couple years so and
we actually have four in there
and we we actually need six
you know I think for this
particular program and I think
we need someone to help start
this program up and I think
trying to pull from other
bureaus within our division and
could be difficult with all of a
capital funding and all the
other funds were administered.
Yeah.
And I watch.
I don't watch this into
appropriations committee but I
just wanted I want to point that
out.
Investment.
Why is it.
Um madam chair representative
yes this is a.
You are looking at these great.
Many representatives behind
thinking for that question and I
a couple of a couple of reasons
for that for a wanting to start
this off with an initial
infusion of a hundred million
dollars but when they we want to
prove the concept we have
already seen great success
through dfa's administration of
a special appropriation that
expires at the end of this
fiscal year
and still in spite of that rate
success but we also want to
prove the concept at a larger
scale demonstrate and better
understand for ourselves and for
all of the.
Exactly how to do this most
effectively and how much demand
is out there um as we continue
on to learn about many many many
additional federal programs that
are unfolding almost on a daily
basis so that's one reason and
we envision that uh my hope in
our hope and putting this
together is that in future years
we can show the balance sheet
weekend show you how much uhm
how many more dollars we've
leveraged with this particular
appropriation attached to the
spell for the initial infusion
and a wall be able to make
really well informed decisions
fiscally going forward about how
much more money to put into this
fund in terms of why it's not
set up as an interest earning
fund
and part because as you are.
And there's a many many
priorities out there for our
revenue surplus this year and
many many priorities are
competing for this same sort of
less dollars and we wanted to
make sure that we got
the match fund set up with
funding and moving in that
direction well also meeting
many.
So okay that would go to the
expertise.
The problem.
Chair representative.
I wouldn't necessarily call it a
pilot program since we you know
two years ago started with one
million then one year ago did
ten million and so I would say
that a hundred million is the
first round.
Madame chair representative I
certainly think that that's
something one could discuss with
legislative finance committee
the one of the things that is
important about this and is
flexibility and nimbleness and I
might want to
have a rebecca add to this but
because there are so many
federal grand opportunities
available it might be difficult
and counterproductive to tie up
funds in a way where we couldn't
access them
so I certainly think that that
is you know your point is well
taken and
worse further discussions but
there may be some unintended
consequences.
Perhaps.
The.
More.
On your.
You have eighty five million
five.
And then
ten million zero twenty nine
seventy three was that a whi.
Thank you madame.
So the ten million dollars uhm
of the amount awarded is from
the ten million the eleven
million infusion
that went to awards to arrow in
front here.
And then you'll see the eighty
five point five million is the
amount um in total that the
projects themselves
brought in.
With the federal so ten million
was state money and eighty five
million includes the federal
money that came in as a result
thank you I think it's a.
It's very.
I kind of you don't have
similar.
Questions are reservations for
how it's done and we're all
there i'm add i'm sure this is a
mean that we're right doesn't
mean.
What I mean is
although I agree with
representative we want to have a
professional fund right as the
whole idea I understand.
Yeah.
Or.
At the same time if you put this
fund in there by the time we
earn.
Some of these.
Gone we won't meet the time
period so you can't between that
right we're caught between
taking care of business today.
The.
And so I you know.
And so this is I mean I I kind
of get.
We're a hundred billion dollars.
As up.
Is a lot of money.
But it's not a lot of money.
If that makes any sense it's a
lot of money in the sense of for
one individual for us right.
But as a state in the need in
the massive need of our state
it's really nothing.
And so i'm almost in all.
As it.
As a business person looking at
the future i'm going you know is
a hundred million enough.
Some of it I say we should have.
A hybrid what we say maybe we
use a hundred million.
And then we've bound and hold a
hundred million.
To get o.
And i'll be younger might be
sounds.
But in my district and the
districts in the place.
And that I have.
Worked in I see little places
like williamsburg and other
little meaning other political
subdivisions other water.
About the need that we have.
The.
And so I managed here I you know
you know this and this is a
beautiful thing about committee
and we need to do.
But everyone coming together.
You make this better idea.
And.
And so I mean I you know I think
that's something that.
Needs to.
I know that I i'll tell you this
I would.
Be very
nervous about.
I was being able to.
Economic environment that we're
in.
We know it's pulling.
And that being said we're we're
we're seeing
that it may be th.
The.
One shot we did great and then
it ends so it's just a thought
that I have now on the other
side I I just want to make sure
and and you can answer.
Prior to this committee manager
representative of where the
money went and where those ten
million went.
And i'm still.
What I was afraid of is it gets
gobbled up coming really less be
honest manager representative
one huge solar project could
take all this the hundred
million bucks so i'm gonna drop
several questions are just
ordered my mind one of them what
is the max what is the m.
Contribution that people want
you know that the entity can get
so that we don't get it
swallowed up by larger entities
and and this is what i'm trying
to stay with what I don't want
to see as I don't want to see.
The bigger enti.
The.
Alberturchy sanity those more
established.
Urban places get you know take
the the line share of this and I
don't see anything that.
Rule for sure I mean this is
great.
But will this continue as
well we did.
That.
Are our most needy.
Across the state.
That we're going to.
All this going to rule.
Chair representative also.
That your thoughts and that
question what we don't have a
cap on an individual award built
into the belt as as you may have
seen what we've intended to do
what we've discussed with our
sponsors with department of
finance and administration is
certainly there is a very clear
need and our world communities
that we fully intend to meet and
that is the large driver.
I'm on the implementation what
were intending is once the
legislation is enacted
department of finance
administration is.
Share those draft with the
public with all the perspective
entities invite them into the
conversation and explore whether
or not it's appropriate and
prudent for all the the possible
entities out there to take
advantage of this funding in the
near term in particular whether
it's prudent to include any
thresholds i'm I think what
we've talked about is at the
very least i'm set a percentage
of the overall funds available
that we want to
insure there are rural frontier
and and tribal communities take
advantage of
and but intentionally that isn't
in the bell to allow the
flexibility in implementation
engaged with other communities
that are eligible
engagement in ongoing.
And identify the best way to get
these fines out across the
entire state of new mexico as
possible.
So better chair
representative we've seen what
happens.
And i'm not going to get into
specifics but bills and.
The.
And then when they become when
they have passed.
They don't follow that intent.
And so I I strongly at.
And i'm gonna firmly say that
we.
In this bill that either uses a
percentage.
So that we can actually know
that was one of my questions
you.
But madam chair in all in all
seriousness I mean
we have to have that because
these larger.
Larger urban areas can swallow
up a hundred million dollars
and we need it
they have a lot more commerce
they have a lot.
Yeah.
The.
Flexibility.
To match the ones themselves
whereas when you get your little
williamsburg.
You're beared early um hatch.
When you start looking at those
and I could go on and on.
They don't have that ability.
And so I I really feel that that
is a huge.
Anything that is sure us.
That that is is for sure thing
and in this a great idea
manager.
I just I need that insurance it
for for.
Definitely gone through for so
many as you travel I think one
of these.
What is the alternative allows
us to see what's going on in our
state all over the sta.
Would you guys
give me manager would you.
Consider representative all.
A fair.
Um.
Thank you.
I'm concerned that you raise an
actually it's a double edged
sword because for the
opportunity enterprise fund we
did put in a priority for rural
and frontier communities and we
also did put percentage caps and
we are coming back this year to
amend that are because it turns
out that that is a problem in
some cases and so you know I
think that there are there are
certainly to approaches
and perhaps.
Rebecca and westley would like
to to talk about their
experiences but I think that it
can also
work in a way that you do not
desire.
Madam chair representative
you know in implementing lots of
application based awards over
the years on the recreational
grant being one again we we made
sure that we got this funding
out to all of the communities to
all of the counties and the
states and
you you have our commitment that
we're going to do that with this
funding as well you know one way
we can do that is to kind of
look at the budgets of these
communities of these local
governments and see you know if
they have the capability to
match the funds themselves and
will put that possibly and our
policy the procedures and make
sure that that is also in there
so I think we we can do things
like that internally to help use
your mind but I I do know that
you know again we have done this
i'm for multiple programs and it
For applications for those big
dollar amounts and that's one
way that we can look at them and
and make sure that we you'll
give the information that we
need to to kind of help them
through that because one way to
do it is to maybe give partial
funding for some of those big
projects i'm so we can still
help support it but not give
them before batch of money
that's available.
The.
The.
Manager representative.
I'm not trying to stay for the.
I'm sure the point of the.
And we think of yourself as an
entity why use my money when I
can use theirs and so we gotta
be careful when there's.
The.
How a high need for a certain
particular project whether it's
more.
I think those are that those are
th.
You know the the little guys the
little guys are being serviced
and when there's no cap is still
although it may start.
Um.
Great project
for for the state and this is
what we decided to use as money
for delivery.
Massive.
Yeah.
Or maybe solar panel project.
Whereas you know I I still have
to go back it's not that I want
to stay for that but I still
would love to see the money
spread around the state in all
these tiny little.
I see that manager
representative that the you know
we were willing.
In gr.
A black fire and flood for
flooding and so that that really
interested me and that's why i'm
going to go back and ask this
question in section three of an
emergency.
The.
Thank you madame chair think you
representative transfers the
emergency class simply means it
goes into effect after.
Think is very important
is the.
And please crept me from wrong
sometimes reports in
some of these agencies.
That are understaffed how huge
vacancy r.
To get.
There funding out.
And that's a con.
Understand that we can see rate.
Adds more staff there I heard
that the percentage is.
Thank you madam chair think you
representative in terms of the
vacancy rates and
and process i'm gonna ask
rebecca and westley to to answer
that but before before I turn it
to them i'd like to drive.
Or the awards this might
relieve your mind somewhat in
the sense that
the way the process works is
that a community.
The application and the award is
continge.
If they you know there is a a
lag time between when you
applied to say we'd like the
matching funds and then you
secure the federal ground but
rebecca and wesley.
I'm chair representatives
and so what we're doing planning
on doing is once they have
applied for the federal funds
they will also apply for our
state matching funds and so when
they apply for that re will give
them an award letter that award
that it will allow them to apply
for those federal funds and then
once they receive word that they
have been aware of those federal
funds they will get that
information to us and then we
will issue the grant at that
time to give them those funds
that's how the process will
work.
Thank you madame sure thank you
representative again you know
this is a.
A dollar and get.
And then the other the last
thing i'm gonna ask.
The.
Is there any per **** is earning
priority to one ti.
Water conservation three minutes
apply water said protect.
One could ta.
The.
Like that and that's why this
way.
Are members of the committee
representative of a very
intentionally there is not any
priorities.
Funded through the match fund if
an entity is eligible to apply
for a federal funding and that
federal funding has a match
requirement.
They can apply to dfa for the
matching funds and there
wouldn't be any protestation
based on types of project and
believe me we've heard from
people who wish that there was
by what we want to drive the
decisions about where these
dollars go is based on the
people who need it we want that
to be the driver and and then in
terms of
your comment without question
and earlier comments about the
potential for individual
projects to and have significant
dollar amounts associated with
their match requirements I will
note that i'm of that entities
that applied to dep.
That's reflected on your hand
out and I believe the largest
request was for an a community
that needed eight million
dollars for a rail project or it
was among the largest probably
and ultimately because there was
only ten million available dfa
made the decision to partially
contribute to the match for that
particular project i'm
encouraging that entity to
continue looking to other places
for that match the last thing I
want to say which kind of came
up in the conversa.
To find our point on it is that
we do expect
applicants for two dfa four
match fines to demonstrate that
they've exhausted other
opportunities to get their match
from other sources and that's
something that we will make
these dollars go farther for
more entities across new mexico
to make sure that we're using
all of the funds available and
that people don't always under
this find because it's easy and
it's obvious and we want to make
sure we're not distance and
advising other sources of fundi.
In manager so again you don't
thank you for.
I'm going to stay you know you
did forty one projects with ten.
Forty.
I hope to see four hundred
projects out of this I hope to
see madame ch.
We have.
The.
The.
With parameters around it where
we only use.
The.
Representative.
The.
The.
And.
And I don't want to I think it's
a.
I have some bigger towns maybe
th.
The.
The record.
The.
Then hopefully when.
Reference to arpa funding.
And.
Yeah.
The.
You know we.
Water system.
So I think there is a balance.
You can have my support
obviously in this committee.
Representative lumon one thing
that I would note is that you
know of the the five sponsors I
am the only one from an urban
area I represent part of alba
kirky and the co sponsors of
this bill represent our frontier
and rural communities so any
discussion would really need to
involve them and the
administration thank you manager
thank you that's what.
Anywhere.
The.
I'm sure thank you for that
question for that clarification
it is a part of this fund in the
bill it says that of the total
balance of the fund one of the
ways one of the authorities the
f a would have to administer
dollars out of the fund would be
in response to requests from
entity is that our recipients of
a match grant through the fund
if they want to apply for a
supplemental grant up to five
percent of the total amount of
their federal award combined
with their state match so i'm
five percent of whatever that
amount is they could come back
to dfa and and ask for
supplemental administration.
Yes.
Then came out of chair is thank
you for everybody members.
This committee house rule
develop.
