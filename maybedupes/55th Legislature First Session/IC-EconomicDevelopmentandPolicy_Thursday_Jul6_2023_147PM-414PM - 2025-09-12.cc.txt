50
on we are still
on the first day of the
economic and rural
development and policy
committee
meeting.
I thank you again
to see the NM for
providing us with lunch
from New Mexico
restaurant Dion's we're very
grateful for that we
do have 2
more presentations
today
and
again I would like to remind our
committee please make sure
your questions are to the point
also reminding our
speakers we do want to be cognizant
of your time as well as the time of the
committee so I know that
Aaron has shared with you
time constraints and so if you
can honor that that would be
fabulous
we are here
now committee we
are talking we will continue to
bring this topic up throughout
our inner
of talking about career and technical
education.
And how many
of us if we're
older we were told
colleges you're only
Avenue. But
we know that college isn't the only
Avenue. We
know that there are other opportunities
for people to be successful
in to thrive
and especially since we know that
these jobs actually at the moment
have a higher return on
investment.
And these are jobs that we found
specially during the pandemic how
is central they were
and how important it is that we
continue to support
career tech ed
up throughout the up throughout
the the area and
so today we have Tory
shocker who is the director of the
career tech education
correct connected learning with the Albuquerque
public school districts she's taking
time out of her day
to be with us and talk about career
and tech ed in Albuquerque public
schools and
one of the things for you that I don't know if you
saw before and we're talking about these
opportunities in this committee is made
that about connections
and about working with each other
and.
Taking
taking the opportunity to
have students in our
school systems work up
into the college level
and into the work force
and so I think that's
kind of continuing the theme without
us actually really knowing it
and so it's working
out well so Torren to go ahead and give
you the floor
and thank you for being here today
you will need to turn your your
Mike on to the little red toward
the red there you
go.
Thank you madam chair.
Members of the committee I I just
want to let you all know how much I
appreciate the opportunity
to to
be here and
share the strategic
work at that
happening
at Albuquerque public
schools from my
perspective from my role
as the director of career connected
learning which
is
includes career technical
education
I first I just want to
point I think there was a
my talking points going
around
so hopefully
I've.
Maybe it shorten
suite.
But I do want to start out
with a talking about a
language shift
that based
on the.
Excuse me based on the
current research and
literature
and it based on
just thinking about how change
happens and and what is
needed to make a shift in
or help us shift in mind
set we've really
started to re branded creating
technical education within
APS as
creating connected learning.
For a couple of reasons
one it's more
it's more
encompassing
when we think about career
connected learning we're thinking
about
the the ultimate and
game right we're talk about
college you might be talking about
that's part of a journey
towards towards
an end game of having a career
but hopefully you
know we're really working with our students
to understand what careers are
available to them
and how to
to ensure those careers and the
various pathways that can get
their and most importantly
one of the careers that
are going to be you you know
rock and in
their communities
so it you
know if it's if it's
not at the really interested in
something that's not necessarily
going to have a lot of
opportunity within the state or
even in their local
community they they
should know that you
know. So
we really just kind of in a shifting
that language a little
bit again
want to see more if it's more increases
because of it includes it
is.
Increases the role
that fine arts please and
purpose of studies
and and languages
for example
and kind of the you know
8 having multiple languages
is an asset in
being career ready
so so again
just really thinking about a much
more inclusive mindset when we're talking
about programs of study
for students in high
school.
I'm.
We're thinking about it much
broader than just high
school we're thinking about it K.
12
and as it connects to
post secondary learning whatever
that post secondary learning needs to
be for that
students at career
path so we're
really thinking about
exposure in
the kindergarten through
through fifth grade
what what
what it what all these what do
all these careers look like
what if you like who
who who does these
careers where they
added our state where they and their
community really
it letting kids know what
what is out there and
and I don't mean by the one
off maybe you
know career fair
or or guest
guest speaker at a class I mean
it's a really
deliberate touch
point through
line through the
entire school year
and the entire
set of elementary grades what is
that career exposure really look
like.
And making no assumptions about
what a student
might be interested in
just making sure they know what the
opportunities are in front
of them and then really
thinking about career
exploration
in grade 6628
eighth grade.
A lot of times
career exploration
really serious career
conversations
do not start start
until ninth grade and they
really need to start sooner
especially because
we. Why do we
want to go to 6 grade why we want to
go seventh grade you know there's no
credits you're not keeping track of
credits yes we're
really starting to lose some
of those middle school grades
and
and helping them kind of see
the the their
trajectory and where they're
going so really giving
them a chance to explore
careers
with in their 60
with great again with the continuum
a through line that lasts all
year not a one off
experience or
one off
presentation.
Then in high school we
we have the more
the kind of specific programs
of study or
pathway so a
sequence of courses
that leads to a particular
career group
and I think that's really important to
understand about
programs of study is there
not so
rigid that
programs of study lock a kid
into being in that career
research actually shows a lot of
kids go into
a totally different career
then they explored in
their program of study in high school
which is just
fine because they were
career ready they knew
what it meant to explore
career to understand the expectations
in the career and to figure
out what is the pathway to
get to that career
so those skills
are are transferable
I'm in can you see that a lot of
different places
around the country who have moved
to have more kind of career
academy a
model.
I just wanna make sure I don't miss
anything.
So.
One of the
one of the it's a big opportunity
that we have APS
is that me
coming into this
position
we're really be launching
what career connected learning looks
like APS it's
it's no longer that
career technical education
and everything else
for college
and I know we put the ad in there but
really the worst the system
is college and
career.
Really trying to eliminate that
bifurcation and really
trying to say this is
about being
career ready and that doesn't
preclude being college
ready that
includes being college ready
if that's part of your
path and that's okay
but you need to know
why he would be going to
college and becoming college ready in the
first
place.
So we're really you know career
connected learning is really the why
why do we go to school every day
why do we show up it's
not enough for that diploma
it's not enough because our mom
and dad or whoever told us to
be there we
really the kids really want a
reason to be
there.
One of the things
that
when I came in to look at
the re launch
really looking
at
what should be driving
the types of programs of
study we're offering
in the district the size of
ours.
Smaller districts understand this
much better than the larger district they
understand we
need to look at what
they call what is the economic outlook
for our our students and let's
just put some energy into
those programs of
study APS's
been trying to be everything to everybody
and all 18 cover
coverage of high schools
and that's impossible and is not
sustainable and it's definitely
not equitable.
One of the problems
is is you spend
a whole bunch of money setting
up a
great
infrastructure maybe
it's
class at a classrooms
recruiting teachers getting the
right equipment in place
technology in place
for particular career pathway
and then that teacher
leaves.
And you don't replace that teacher
and all of that is
now wasted
funding.
Or you have
a principal come in
and values
something different
and so changes
the process some of the processes that
might now.
Cut off the stream
of recruitment to a particular
pathway that's a really
reality that happens
that's that's going to shift I I
feel the
other thing is
what what was
kind of being offered
wasn't necessarily
balance between economic
priorities and student
interest it really
was what what teachers do
I have that that meet
the licensure requirements to could
teach the class which is
not a way to offer programs
of study and what
we've always been doing
we've always offered this class
or what what is
you know what is a small group of students
for this this tier really want
to teach and so is this one
off course that isn't
really connected to anything
it's just as important
but we can't
be everything to
everyone.
Not and not anymore not
about the size that we are
so we're really
trying to focus on building
equitable sustainable
and efficient.
And we're looking I've
I've been in creating
technical education for connected
learning for most
of my career 20 so my
career your career
and I've seen schools all around the
country so I
really understand what best
practice looks like and
can look like
I'm also founder of a career
technical education
charter school here in Albuquerque
so
so Billy understand what
the possibilities are
and what the whole continuing
can look like in in
in implementation.
So one of the things were really going to
look at as we re launches the
quality of our programs of
study.
And we're really we're really
leveraging some best practice
tools out there
through a C. T.
E. which is
a professional attainment critical
or education
organization
and they have a rubric that helps
us guide or
guide are are kind of have the
same mental
model of what a strong
quality programs study should look
like.
That includes career
guidance and
includes
collaboration with the business
community.
The other thing that
again we're really
thinking about how can we deliver
it you deliver it about
career education K.
12.
And how it
connects to post secondary
so it's not enough to end with
graduation we
want to make sure kids have a
plan and have the
knowledge the skills
experiences the professional
network to make that plan a
reality.
So what we're finding
in APS's we have these
spattering so
I've only been there a year this
position so we have this batteries
of offerings
but again they they were deficient
and what might be offered at this
school is
great but only
it's only available to the kids
at that school.
And that's not equitable
it doesn't aim and we can't
necessarily take this program and
offered at all 18 high
schools so
we have most of our kids missing
out on this really high quality
experience.
So our
strategy
and mmhm mind
you also I have
decide load for
connected learning at a
piece
so I started
by collaborating in meeting
with every single department I
could get my foot in the door
with and saying Hey what is
your work what
what would you do what school
do you work with what is your
strategic work and
then with the strategic
developments
that APS's board has been
going through that has been
very helpful
in finding
the finding the right
leverage points for
creating connected experiences and
program adding up programmatic
changes within the district
so we're being very strategic
and very collaborative and very
deliberate in
a non silos
space which to
me is very
new. At
at a district this
large.
So I think that's a very a
big
positive.
So when we look at
our strategies
again we're looking at
really evaluating
high quality what is out
there what's our high quality programs
of study how
are they linked to our economic
outlook for high wage
high growth of jobs
in our our students communities
both our local
you know area of town
communities but also the
larger Albuquerque community
in the
state.
And then and then really
thinking about
how we take
something that has worked for
50 years the career management
center at Albuquerque public
schools and is
a beautiful model
of best practices
increase in crude connected learning
and programs of study how do
we take that after 50
years and begin to
build that
out so that it's available
to more students.
Now the the
fantastic thing about being in New
Mexico is
that APS doesn't doesn't
just have a CC to look
at but we can look
at other school districts that are
doing great things
with in our state Rio
Rancho Hobbs
a Los crucis they've
all got these things that they're doing
really well that we can go
and learn from and that's
fantastic because I really
believe that we have the talent
and expertise
in the state to solve
you know to really make
the best of this really relaunch
and solve our our
challenges.
So one of the
big movements
or strategies
is
to
we're I move forward
opening a we're
calling it a professional
have it
could be similar to
a technique that tax center
or an academy
if you're familiar with different terms
terminology in
CTE
and it's similar to what Rio
Rancho public schools is doing
with their
careers CTE
building and
with CNM
so what I'm proposing
really isn't new in terms
of best practice but is
new and
APS's wait that work
best systemic way of
work. So
we started moving forward
building out the
first professional have
that focuses on to
pathways or
career clusters
particularly.
The first one is the as
logistics transportation
and distribution which
houses are
automotives.
That hasn't houses it
can house some civil
engineering pathways
or programs of study
so it's it's pretty
diverse
and and
so that
that.
Set of
courses.
Would I delete move to this
have.
And the second
pathway would be the manufacturing
pathway so
and manufacturing we're talking
everything
from
some auto CAD and
design to
computer programming
to
the skilled trades
woods has
welding and
so on but we're thinking
about them and a much more
collaborative and connected
way as opposed to the side
of elective
courses that
happen to to meet
the the requirements of the sequence
but really thinking about if we put them
all in the same
location.
The teachers see them
as much more
integrated and
see them as much
more like the
real world you know you
might be an auto mechanic
that also needs to
machine part
and or weld part
for this
automotive project
that you're working on or
you need to understand how
this vehicle is going to be
used with in
a transportation system
and how does that work in one of
the moving components of
that so it's at
the the teachers and
and honestly
I see it also as a
much more dynamic
and innovative way
of preparing kids
for careers in these
pathways.
So we're hoping by
kind of expanding on
that C. C.
model
through the professional have
that we can centralize
some of those highly
highly specialized high
price high
priced
equipment
and we can kind of
concentrate some
of
some of the specialized
skill set that is
needed to run some of that equipment
into one or
2 hubs of this
nature but
also allow
for some help us
some professional learning communities
amongst those
teachers right now you might
have one
autos teacher or one culinary
arts teacher or or one
business management
teacher at a high school
and they don't have any other thought
partners the teacher
common curriculum
in their building so the
pretty isolated
this this concept
would kind of break some of that
down
and then our job would be to get
kids to the hub
from anywhere in the district much
like we get kids to CDC
from anywhere in the
district.
I think the other the
other component is
that we
can.
Narrow the
the I guess
the targets for business
and community members a set
of business and community members
trying to target 18 high
schools they can maybe
target 2 hubs
in their professional
as a professional kind of
connection to high school
students so
hopeful hoping that that might
make it a little bit more
accessible for
for our
business partners to talk about
okay it's it's job fair
month we're gonna get 100
requests for job fair you
know participation that takes a
lot
so you know we're there's
lots of details to work out
but I think the point
and ensuring
this.
Big strategy is
that we're
thinking about the
way.
People work professionally
now and even
if they're working you
know from home they're still
working as part of a team.
So that ability to
really collaborate and understand
what the other person
on your team really does
and how what you have
to. How what
you're doing leads
to the next person
and ultimately the the
high quality product that you're
producing that is a
career skill that is
and and we don't think about that we think that
it's like being able to work as
a group but that's
really that's really
a career a
career
asset.
So let's
see and if you need to
do the other the
other component
of the this main
strategy or swimming
strategy but this big one that I'm
sharing is
that
we're hoping that
if someone in the professions
sees
this level of
professionalism
for these programs city
teachers and the students
who are taking these courses
we're hoping and we think
that that might help
recruitment so
if if I'm
in if I'm a welder
and I and you know I
want to go teach
but I don't want to teach in a regular
building that might not even have a
quick meant that works or might not be
set up correctly for
welding.
And I'm probably going to take a pay
cut because you
know that you
know is that really a
way to recruit people probably
not so or we know
it's not so we're we're
definitely hoping
that that would play a role in
helping to recruit future
future
instructors
so you know
I think that's just that's just one
big strategy
but ultimately
we want to really help
all.
Our high schools
rethink
how career connected
learning.
Looks and feels
in their high
schools and
what are the right
programs of study to be
offering at their high
schools that we
can offer everything
to everybody but if we
are going to offer something
specific how do
we offer that to any student
throughout the entire
district and how do we get
kids there and I do
believe that we would have
to think differently about how we
budget our funding
but I do believe that we can figure
it out
and that you know.
Just just looking at
how many middle schools I've been able
to pull into our
Perkins I and next
Gen funding
this year I've been able to pull
half of our middle schools and
and that's never happened
but that's because we're starting
that conversation about what is career
connected learning look like
6 to 12
and how can we really
support support
the schools and changing
the way they do that not dictate
how they do that I think the
business community can can
inform that really
supporting them in doing
that
so
that's kind of big
picture some of
our change in the re
launch one big project
I want to share with you
and there's so
much more I
could go on and on and on but
I would love to answer questions
and again I really
appreciate this opportunity
and hope that this leads
to further conversations
going forward
thank you so much story
we have Representative remains going
to be the first one is our
Senator so let and take
that Senator
Stefanics.
Representative
Herndon.
Senator Lopez.
Senator
Tallman.
May be Representative
Lujan.
Hi with that money
love it okay
so Representative
right. Thank
you madam chair
and.
The vote to give you a compound
question just try to
speed stuff up
so
APS is working
with C. N. M.
to get
students who are in the
AP program
to take like English
and you know
classes such as that
or you working to
go ahead and
get.
Our high school students
to see and them
so that they could
go ahead and take like
welding electrical
plumbing.
Thank you madam chair
Representative
absolutely
I think when you look at
what a what a quality
program of study
includes
absolutely includes
a dual credit
opportunities work based
learning opportunity
AP opportunity where
appropriate
and we have
started working with C.
N. M. much more closely
this year and and actually
have started attending all
of their program
of study advisory
boards or advisory
meetings so that we
can understand
what the business community is telling
them understand how they're
responding to that so that then we
can respond
and
and create that pipeline in that
connection.
And madam chair
expert how many
children are going
to C. N. M. in the
trade
section.
Madam chair representative
I don't have that
number and
getting the right data has
been in my
12 months be in this
position has been very
difficult
and that's the you know
as we re launch really
ensuring that I have access
to the data that
I need to be
informed about what's
happening and where we need
to address gaps
is definitely is been
part of my strategic work
both with the PED but also
within the district
my guess is going to
be that it is
less than 100
students.
Madam chair the expert what
I'd like for you to do is get
the number
and give it to the
committee so that we can
included in the equipment
here and I'd like
it broken down by
a
trade.
Thank you madam
chair.
Thank you Representative look forward to this
details as well
half.
Are you ready for the next question
right Max
officials.
Satisfaction messing
thank you madam chair and
thank you and director
for coming today.
I'm assuming that these
communities these learning
communities cannot all be
done by zoom so
is there is not
an added expense
to your
new.
Concept and
structure.
Madam chair
Senator there
is.
Yeah they're definitely not submit differently
in person if
we're for referring to the
professional up
definitely in person
experiences
what it's going to
require and
what other districts have
done is
thinking about scheduling
help students are scheduled
differently what
their weekly schedule and daily
schedule can help how about
can accommodate a more
extended time
face to face in those
spaces with
instructors
I think it
also
is going to require us to think differently
about how we fund
sites.
Programs in
addition to our
professional have programs
so you know maybe it's
that we offer just the higher level
courses at the professional
hub.
And keep maybe some of
the the intro courses
at school sites
you we haven't figured that out
yet but I think the
cost.
Long term is
going to be less
because we're not trying to
quit every high
school with
with standard you know
industry standard equipment
every single year
ends we're going to
we're going to be able to get
access to kids
who you know for kids who
don't have it currently
in their own high school there comprehensive
high school in the neighborhood
so I think.
I think
it's I also think
this will be less waste
which is going to you
know equity into
a savings I think ultimately
also.
So madam chair
my question
was.
Lee to tease out whether or
not this is more
amenable to a very
large school district
or whether or not smaller
school districts that
have.
More budgetary concerns
would have a problem with it or whether
it would be easier to do it
and in a
smaller.
Thank you so I
I just think it's something
to tease out I like the
model madam
chair and just trying to tease
out doesn't work
everywhere that's all
thank you thank you senator
I think there's there are always opportunities
when we look at these model programs
because we all know that are are
different areas are so unique
and have different needs and challenges
and you know one
of the the point of the conversation
is to see what little nuggets we can
pull and that
would work in our communities and then
the other ones that might be more appropriate
for bigger school district
but there might be some some
stuff in there that we can we
can also use but I do appreciate
the conversation starting
that. Thank
you Representative
0.
Thank you madam chair
so my question to you
is in terms of this plan
that you laid out to us today
what is your expected
launch
date.
Madam chair representative
our.
Goal expected
launch date would be
2 school years from now
so that would be a school
year 26
so the the fall of
2025.
We figure because
the the current
we're we're looking at
renovating one of our
existing buildings the
transportation hub for
the district had half
that building is currently not being
used we're going
we're going to be
renovating that
so we figure a year of
design and renovation
and programmatic
program programmatic build
out both
both.
Arket in architectural
terms but also
in
in the
curricular.
Terms and then
launch
so
and we also want to begin
thoughtfully recruiting and how
do we do you know
how do we have that correct
and deliberate
career guidance in place
for all of our students so
that when the time comes
they all have the opportunity
to say Hey I I want to pursue
that
option thank
you Madam expert
madam chair
with respect to the
putting together this entire
process who's a
part of your team do you
have parents do have
you members please tell
us a little bit about who's with
you. Madam
chair representative
right now we're in the very early
stages so
we just started
moving this forward
in maybe
June
or sorry April may of
this last last
spring.
We are leaning
on the community
and parent and student
feedback of that was
solicited by the board during
their strategic
their strategic.
Planned development
and their community listening
sessions
so we're definitely cleaning
information from that
initially because it's ultimately
informing that the
strategic plan that we need to be
aligned to
and we currently
the summer we have student
interns who are
helping us think about what
we're the right places
to start to tap into
to get the most voice we
can from our parents and our
students
so we're we're making those plans
for next school year
and then
in terms of the teachers the teachers
have been the teachers
of courses in these programs
of study have been
in the conversation since I
got the thumbs up so
in April I brought
them all together and
started the the
conversation the design
conversation about what
what what could this look
like what could this
mean for our
students
so they've been on the
ground since the very beginning
with in that
there are
Representative there are
are you members in that Representative
in that in that group
but I think ultimately as we
go forward there will be a
series of very formal
deliberate conversations
we have with various stakeholders
including our business
community
with in those
pathways
so it's very early plants
yes there's there will
be.
There will be those those
spaces for that voice to
be continued thank you
and madam chair.
Madam expert just one final
question with respect
to
the.
Utilizing the past this gonna
take you toward
CTE.
You have talked about
continue with the justification
at CNN which I think is
wonderful I
don't want to go any further
are you is this program
also going to be designed
in such a way
that a student can be
ready to work
ready when they graduate
from high school I'm
assuming you're talking about 2 different
paths one for college
and one that is going to take you down
to work at and
would you please explain
that because
in the last presentation
by the school board
members graduation
rates were down and
people were leaving
because one of the things they needed
to do was get a job and
now you gonna be helping them so would you
please explain that.
Madam chair representative those
are great questions
first
first
the the
any any high
quality or Getty quality
program of study has
several options at the end
of a program of study
so it can be a 2
year could be a 4 year
college but it could
be for the ship
program pre apprenticeship
program it could be just
earning a certification
or going right into
a a a career
of entry level career
position
so it doesn't have to be in
and I think that's why state post
secondary training as
opposed to
college because
that post secondary training could
be offered by your
business that hires you
and provides that
that very
specific training in
your position or
it could be that that the
company that hires you put you into an
apprenticeship program
or you know there's lots of
ways to for that
post secondary education to
continue
and I think it's very dependent
upon how you
enter your career
field
so I definitely
do not feel that
there are 2
paths I
feel that there
are it
you know here's a career
group.
And you know here's
a per cluster career
cluster and hear some
pathways.
To that career cluster
and some of these pathways
include.
For your college to your
college apprenticeship
whatever whatever the
cases and
educating them
about what that means
and what what research
is showing us is
that strong career
guidance and
access to high quality programs
of study like I've
had like I've been
yes talking
about in
the prepares
kids just
as well for
college.
The as a college
track
would.
The differences is that it
also prepares them for career
readiness
that as a purely
college track or pathway
may not or will
we're seeing that now right we've
spent the last couple
decades just doing college
readiness college for all
and our kids aren't
aren't prepared right for
for for
career so
so I think it's it's a both
and it's not an either or
it's completely dependent
upon how
that student wants to into
that that career
opportunity
one of the things I love about that
trades is
there are several
ways to enter a
trades career
and and it's just it's very
dynamic and
my son in law who
went to a college prep high
school started in college
now has college debt and
finished his degree his
apprenticeship as an
electrician
that's really what he wanted to
do
and
and he's about to make more money than
I am.
So that
to me it
speaks to your point
about you know making
sure that people
know.
Whatever your path it's
a valuable.
As long as it's a path to
something and I think
that's that's the kind of education
and guidance we need to be
providing for
kids I think I answered
all your questions thank you madam
chair thank
you.
Thank you Representative
Senator Lopez and then Senator
Tallman.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you very much for your
presentation
you the career in Richmond center
I attended.
Years ago.
And of course back in those days
it was the hub for
Albuquerque public
schools
for those high schools
that didn't have the
expertise.
And I know it's still being utilized
that same way.
Except back in my day it was to
train girls
to be secretaries
so go figure I'm not
a secretary right now know how to
type very
well.
But what I believe
is and
I'm very glad to hear that you're
looking at hubs
around the city
within APS because it's not
just the city is also in the
county.
I attended some of the listening
sessions that
the board I did
held
and at the
Rio Grande High
School
I know there is a request
for career
technical add
CTE.
Those are some parents who are very
I think kept up to speed as
to what value this
brings
and I
I.
I I liked what I was hearing
because I think it adds so much
value to what we talk about
education.
And in light of what
different school districts can
do
the LFC
visited hops
and I know that Representative
Lujan was there too and we
had a great presentation for
what they're doing with their with
their big huge new
building school
of what they're doing for can to
career technical at
I think just phenomenal so that's just
in a much smaller school
district but they're
geared towards oil
going to oil field
and all of the expertise that
they need for the
workers to be.
And I think madam chair
what this I think adds
value for
us
in talking about what affects the
state of New Mexico
for our young people.
They're gonna be taking care
of us in whatever field they
choose and I
I get it.
But I also believe that we have to
have that conversation with our
young people and not in high school
but in middle
school.
Because all they see
is what's on here.
And I think to to
be making money is such
as glamour
but that's not the reality.
And I believe it that's still part
of what needs to be a conversation
between our public school
system our business
community of such as to really
reach out and try
to give our young people of
perspective and maybe not just
talking but really
utilizing this
stuff.
On how to present it to
them because this is the mode
that they also learn
from much more than just
just sitting here just talking heads
and such and and
school.
I have it as a sixth
grader of coming.
And for what her
valuation wanted to be a veterinarian
and kids to
change.
But I think it's also that
expertise that you can
bring and I'm hoping
not just with yours but others
just to have those who
work to come in
and talk and actually have an
internship.
Not paid volunteer
they can put on their resume
as the field and that's part
of talking for
future
career building
but for them to actually
see.
Actual application.
We talked about this madam chair for
years what
you're education
provides
we can keep throwing more and
more for those who
teach to teach
our kids but it with
now in day if you don't
actually I think have a
personal
experience
to see what's going
on. If
there's no relation.
Part of that madam chair I think it's
because of this thing
it's all on here
and you don't see the reality of
what a veterinarian
what they have to do
or somebody who has
a a gift working
with their hands and our young
people do it how
do you add value for that
tinkering there
that's value to it
right and for any
of our career and I think that's part of
a message that we have to
get out.
If you're gonna be a plumber
electrician you still have to
know your mouth
I mean those are all the things that we have
to remind the next
generation.
I just wanted to add that madam chair
I just I appreciate to hear the
hubs
there's some schools are being closed
in Albuquerque public schools I'm
hoping some of those buildings
can be utilized we
don't have to go back and build something
you right thank you madam
chair.
Thank you Senator
Lopez Senator
Tallman.
Then Representative Lujan
Representative Garrett Representative
Martinez.
Thank you. Madam
chair.
Thank you
expert press
with the give the impression
that you're very dedicated and committed
to a career energy
career technical.
Education so my question is do
you have any plans to ask
the state legislature
first specific
funding and so what might that
be.
Share
madam chair as
senator that
is a very good
question
I I
can.
I can imagine that
at some point in
the future there could
be an
ask.
I think if I had to
ask.
The the legislature
for anything
right now it would
be to
Senator Lopez as
point.
This is a way to
very deliberately
support work based learning
opportunities
right now we're starting to
expand paid
internships our students need
to work we know that's a
challenge
we know they need that real
that real experience of not just
a job shadow or
volunteer for a week a
real job
experience to
understand.
You know understand that
world
in there are some
barriers there's definitely
has have been some opportunity
that's opened up this
year might
Department.
Well with received one of
the innovations owned
grants to expand
our work based learning
throughout the district
and have pay and
and part of that work based learning
is paid internships and I think
that's really really
important
so I think it might
ask
now would be how can
we support and I just
I don't have it necessary and ask
maybe a question
how can we support
businesses
and freeing up
there.
Employees to
provide that
mentorship
that is.
Rusu is
crucial
and you know and make because
it is a cost to them
to to give up time to do
that
other than that I think
moving forward I can imagine
that there be
requests.
Perhaps
around.
Problem solving transportation
for students so that we can get
kids to these hubs
but but right now
I don't.
Feel I have a
of and ask
beyond that right
now. I I
feel like I have
the resources I need
to to begin
and get started
thank you for the answer thank you for
being here that's all I have of
madam chair. Thank
you senator Thoman
Representative
Lujan.
Thank you madam
chair.
So.
A couple things
I guess I would continue
to mentor to
have a discussion
and.
Center and we're going to talk about with
disabilities and opportunities and
and kind of get into that conversation
see what we're
doing.
To the your of all that
for APS involvement as far
as like.
What are the career
development
opportunities that you're
providing a
you're talking from grade 6 all
the way to through high school
so as a as a parent
with a child that had an
IEP when
it came to high school he was able
to sign
off and not have to participate
or have an IEP so
what are you implementing
when they get to high
school.
And even by law age
14.
To assure that they
are still going to get the services how
are you how are you
providing
resources and
accessibility for those students
madam
chair.
Madam chair representative
I think that's a really
really important
question.
Within the
we were designing
the the schools
that we
launched.
Some of our
8. Kind
of key
learners that
informed are designed were
learners who receive special
education services
and it was because the access
to learning and demonstrated
proficiency differently.
And. So that
really have pushed us to
think outside the
box as much as the
industry average
required us to think outside the
box. I
think. One
of the things that
program of study courses has to
offer students
who engage in learning
differently
is
the.
Practice a project based
learning you have a reason
from beginning to end
you have different ways
of of
accessing your
learning of different ways of showing
that you've learned
and I think that really opens up a lot of
doors for
students.
Traditionally.
Don't access learning in
the same way.
One of the things that we did this
last year was connect
with transition services
at it APS and those
are our students those of the students
in APS who
have met all the
graduation requirements
but maybe not
all of their IEP
goals were met
or they had they need a
little more support
transitioning to adulthood
and they had never
worked with CTE
or career connected learning
and.
That was so
surprising to me I'm I'm I
have a I was a special education
teacher when a classroom and
a science teacher so I have kind of
those those
worlds in my
head all the time
but it
was.
To bring our
resources to them and when
I see resources I mean funding
but also programmatic
resources
near peer tutoring was
the program we brought to them
and their first response was
will so we
that appears will be
tutoring our students and
I said no no your
students would be that.
Years to do it tutoring
there near appears
they would be the teachers they would be
getting paid as the tutors
and that just
totally flips
the way that they would normally
were interacted with
and I think you just
the way in which.
My team has
worked is
to appreciate assets
and think about what what
is this group of people have to
offer and how can
we provide them those
experiences
in terms of special education
services there's not much
I can incorporate or
or required other
than
emphasize
the value in program
of study
courses
in allowing for
practice of court academic
skills them
in the context
of a space where they can
make mistakes and have revision
because that's real life.
And again
be able to show what
they're with their
learning has been
through various
means
so I think opportunity
and flexibility
is what I could
offer offer them
in terms of that
specific need thank
you madam chair I liked how we build
that out because we knew and
you know Committee did
attend to.
It's called Cape which the center for
advancing policy unemployment for
use.
And you know it's
just and this with a quote
during their transition
to the work force force
youth and young adults with
disabilities can
experience considerable challenges
that can affect employment
outcomes
with additional intersecting
identities such as belonging to the
LGBTQ I plus community
or being involved in the
just justice system we
which we haven't even touched on right
may experience additional barriers
that limit workforce development
opportunities and
long term employment
so these are the things that we can catch
at this time at this age in
our schools
and I mean I've
read through what you print you gave
us today and I want to say thank you
for focusing on
career
learning career technical
education
looking at K. to twelfth
grade with transition to post
secondary learning I did house memorial
on that the
report from
PED H. E. D. workforce
solutions will be coming up September
1 so I would
just.
Ask you to look at that report when it
comes out to for further
information on what you're doing
here thank you madam chair appreciate
it. Thank
you representative Representative Garrett
and then Representative
Martinez.
Thank you madam chairwoman
and thank you for being here
Tory.
If you've presented to a committee
before I
have we have
okay
my first question madam chair
is about the eighth grade next steps
plans I'm
a former eighth grade teacher in the
south valley here some middle
school
and I
don't know if it's still
only on paper or
has been transferred to
online.
Madam chair representative
that is a
huge project for
me is
the next step planning
process
tools.
And what does that
mean.
How do we use it
who does it where does it
live
and it right
now in that
this in our
district
every school
instructional council gets
to make the decision how that
is completed.
And it is it it
is an issue
it is an issue it's not being
done systemically.
District wide it's not being done
while it's not being done
consistently.
And interestingly
enough I would say the only
students who have
any consistent
thoughtful transition planning
or next at planning our students
with special education
services
so
that is
on
on my strategic plan
next steps for this coming
year
and one of the
things we're looking as Ross
will ros
will schools is
looking at an automated
or a digital
next at planning
tool. That
tracks everything
and so we're really looking
at that to see how
that's working for them what does that
look like is that
scalable you know we've talked about
different sizes
being able to use different tools
that you know in different
ways.
But I would like to see
that become
much
more.
Important and
valuable and it's
not just something to do
to be in compliance or to do
a transcript Act
it's really something to do
to help kids understand
what their opportunities are
and that requires a lot of
systemic change you
you know you
know what when does that happen
where does that happen you know
so that
was a conversation we're having today
as a matter of fact around
our districts school
3 which is
how do we begin to
leverage
the adult
relationship spaces like
an advisory.
To really do that
work because it's
crucial. And
madam chair and try can you explain
I think many people here probably
don't know what the next steps
plan is just
the basics what's
required Madam
chair representative the
next step plan
is
in the theory.
A document
that captures
some strengths the student
has some
goals the student might
have and
some.
Not only academic
courses that they should be
taking but
also the fair
some program
of study courses that they should
be taking that complement each
other and ultimately
to reach a post secondary
goals so the goal for after
after
graduation
they can look a lot of different
ways.
At me at
the school that I
I co founded and
started it
was a more
narrative a
document
where it included
some quantitative data like
test scores or attendance
and stuff like that just for the students to
be able to talk about their quantitative
data but it
really have them exploring
what who they are and
what they want to be doing as
adults and how
that might change depending on the
experiences are having or
want to have
some some forms
are simply a checklist
of did you do these did you
meet these graduation requirements
and so on
but it is intended to
capture the plan
for students to move
through starting in eighth
grade and move through high school
graduation.
Thank you madam chair and
Tory this is a statewide
requirement
and unfortunately the
bipartisan high school
requirement bill crafted
by
leisure lane
and Education
Committee chair
Romero didn't pass
because it asked that I was the
statewide level that this be
reviewed so thank you I'm glad that
APS is doing that.
The next thing I have
madam chair Tories
you know there's tremendous emphasis now
on traits
and so I noted
APS we had a
wonderful rock and roll band
that was in the woodshop
terrific in a space
for a band but it wasn't for
the traits alright alright
my concern is I I took 4
years of journalism
that was my career path
in high school
I did courses in
broadcast journalism the
local.
Attention your callers that were
excellent my concern
is it's wonderful to
recognize all the trees
looked fissions all these
things but
how do you also
incorporate things like
journalism graphic design
of someone who graduated from
data charter school
Albuquerque at
the age of 18 got
$80000 a
year of web
design job was Ford
motors so
I just how are you
ensuring
that.
We do the broad
comprehensive career
paths.
And don't just swing
back the other
direction.
Madam chair representative I
think that's a another
really really good question
that the
some recent a
recent white paper I think could be
leased by more
DC talked
about how do we make sure
that we are not just swinging
back to old folk at
mindset and I
think
that's another reason why
I use career connected
learning because if I
looked at just C. T.
E..
Journalism
film.
Those things are not
tagged
as C. T. but
they're very much
program of study
courses
so they
are included when we talk when
I talk about the
story
of of APS's
programs of study I will be
including those
programs of study
it's it truly
is to me I'm
I'm very very driven
by
adults not making
decisions for kids
but just saying Hey
here's the options
within our community
here's how you get to those
options
and not not making
the decisions
for them based on
whatever
but I I do I I think that's
been a huge issue
and
when I've met with
I started meeting with the finance
department.
At at
APS and again
they had never collaborated
with creating connected
learning your CTE
but stagecraft
is an application
of woods
or or even
our our our
culinary arts
you know I mean there's there's just so
much that connects
I could go on and on but
for time
thank you just my final
question madam chair
and Tory is
part of the bill does high school
studies passed the
house and Senate it was vetoed
by the governor
but one of the inclusions
was entrepreneurial
studies business
development I know programs like
Dick I have done that for
decades
but it was important
to the ducation Committee that that
entrepreneurial
people learn that that
a career path is growing a
business I would just ask
you to make sure you click
that. Thank
you.
Thank you Representative
gear we have Representative Martinez
and then finishing off vice chair
guide us.
Thank you madam chair
just 11
question that I'm kind of curious
about you made
mention of trying to get away
from the 1 offs
you know career days somebody coming
in and talking to 1
class.
Can you kind of get a little bit
deeper on what your concept
is it's going to get away
from the one
offs.
Madam chair representative
so one of a couple of
things that we
have
seen
at the match
at the metro Nashville
Nashville metro schools in
Nashville Tennessee
and they do for all of
their coverage of high schools
are set up in academies
and they
have
regular convening
this at the high
schools.
With the business
partners of those industries
working with the teachers
and developing
curriculum
end of those business
partners come
in on
a regular basis
to either you know co
teach or
provide feedback and mentorship
to students on a particular
project
on a so it's an on
going
relationship
depending on
what what's happening in the
classroom at the time so that's
one model I I
think another model
is allowing
it.
For
on site is in for
some professions it's
hard to get kids
on site as much as
possible but for
them to be in those spaces
in a real way so
a job shadow is great
but what about a job shadow
we're we actually complete a
task that
one of the employees
has to complete for that
week or whatever there's different
ways you can really
elevate
the kind of past
experiences
that requires a lot of support for
employers to know
okay I'm gonna have a bunch
of kids in my space hat what
do I do that
also
requires.
A thinking about how
what is the right group size to
engage with
for for different
experiences.
Another thing that we have
thought about
is
having
not only like not
only a trades
fair
or.
Or
at a solution they do a
heavy equipment rodeo
but perhaps tying
that directly to
some career guidance
mentorship but the on the
that this on going through
maybe advisory
so I think
there's lots of different
ways it can look
and.
I think that goes back to my ask
about how do we
support businesses and
freeing up a person or
some people for
certain amount of time
temporarily to
engage in mentor our young
young people one
of the very
successful
events that that
I supported through
our resources
was New Mexico 5 film
prize junior this last
year and
one of the fantastic
things about that is it
started out
with.
Professional development
by the experts
by of the
professionals with their
teachers
then those experts
continued on a monthly
basis with that
in person or virtual
mentorship.
To that group of students and
that profession that that
teacher and then
when their scripts were
ready they were sent
to that professional that professional
gave them feedback and send them
back and then
they produce their
film and and it
was public at
the at the Film
Festival so
that kind of very
beginning to
end
from professional development to the
teacher to evaluation
of the students learning
all of I mean that's
really I think the
magic where the magic happens
and where that that
professional network
begins to develop for students
who not be who may not normally
have access to some of the
film industry industry
but now they do.
Right and that could be the set for any
any industry but that that's an
example of what
what we just did this
last year.
As.
Thank you madam
chair.
Representative guys.
Thank you madam chair and thank you
presenter
just wanted to tell
you of it an experience I
had a couple weeks
ago this
speaker was down in down
in the county we were doing a listening
tour with many of
our business leaders and
when you were talking about
paid internships
I found that many of
the business leaders were
very.
They like the idea they want
to do it they talk about
it but the
reluctance is is
these are entry level positions
where they're really having to teach
the students
you know one in particular
who made an impact that
was a business leader who
ran a movie theater
says I'm I'm teaching you
know young adults how
to you know give
out
you know money how to
how to take orders
how to make popcorn is
is is a very into a
positions and I
can't afford
to be pain you know
for internship
where I wanna if I have the
opportunity I'm gonna take on
somebody who has a little bit more
experience and
probably will be a little bit more
reliable so
what are you all doing
to either change
some of that maybe
narrative for the dialogue
so business
owners will be more receptive
to having our young
kids
in in the workplace Madam
chair representative
that is also a great
question thank you all for asking
such good ones
one of the things
of that we know about
paid internships one
is you can't just place
a kid you've got to
develop that relationship
with that employer
so that you understand the needs
and their fears
and you can help begin to address
that with pre
learning whatever the cases
job coaching whatever it could look
like
the the biggest
piece
that
that makes this work
is that we're not asking them
players to pay
interns.
We're using grant
funds to pay the
interns
we're asking employers to
mentor them as an
intern.
So it's costing them
player in kinds
but not actual
paid out you know paying the
intern
and I and I think it's really
important
to think about
capacity and
do we have are we going to
place an intern in that
particular situation
that is a quick learner can figure
that stuff that really
quickly or
are we are we gonna play someone in
there who might need a lot
more
you know development and
coaching and if that's the
case then how we
gonna find that support
instead of relying on the on
the Business
to provide that so I
I call it like a continuum
of high touch and low touch
and we collaborate
with future focused education on
some really high touch
paid internship programs that
are are really
really effective but
you also have some more low
touch for example the interns
that are in my office this
summer. We have
in 1010 in terms
of the city
center this year
and we do
have them doing some entry
level work but they
all came in with some
kind of their older kids so
they all came in with some kind of
basic.
The skill sets that we could
just have them apply
to whatever
project we needed
so that's kind of an example of a
low touch you know
but I think it's very important
not just to have a one
size fits all but
to make sure that we're building the
internship around a
relationship and understanding
needs and then making
sure we have the supports
and again you
know.
Paying our interns
but not out of the
business's pocket
but through grant funding
through I can pay in
turns out of Perkins I you
know there's there's ways
to do that
so
that sometimes doesn't
deviate.
Some of the some of the stress
but it is it's just it's
stressful to think what am I gonna do with
this kid all day I mean
if you don't you're not around kids all the
time it's a normal
normal conversation so
thank.
I appreciate the the
clarification and
I think it's important to
give special
young adults that
opportunity to be in
a work
environment
because that's where they're learning how to
interact and really
it gets a prepared to
say this you know might be a career
opportunity or
I need to make sure to go back
to school to make sure I
I I do something different
thanks I think that there's
there's teachable moments in both
places so appreciate your
presentation thank you
Madam.
Thank you so
much I I'm
it's we're we're actually
on time.
That that may have planned it
that way and I appreciate the committee
be respectful of that if
you if there are other opportunities
for questions you're welcome to email
Aaron and she will follow up
over the monitory
to ask any other
further questions but thank you
so much for that I think
there's certainly a little bit
some pieces there that we're all
thinking about how we can bring those
back to our communities and
and you know I
always appreciate the
offering of of being able
to brainstorm because many of us
are starting to be creative and
and think about these things and like
how we can make it work in our community
because we recognize the
importance of being
able to make sure that our young people
have a career to go
into but then
there's also our job to make sure
that there are jobs for them to
take and to use
and so you know we've got
this again using the
reference of a a tire
wheel in the spokes
to go to with that so thank
you very much for appreciate you being
here in your time and I know that you've
got another presentation
to go to so you're all warmed up
I'm I'm warmed up yes thank
you madam chair thank you committee I
really appreciate that this
opportunity and the questions
thank you so much for being here
we've got our last subject
of the day talking
about the local news fellowship
program but I would like to remind the
committee staff
is giving you a folder if you
haven't filled out your per
diem and your
meeting being here make sure you do
so and given that either
Nicole or
Aaron

us access
to 1 of the many food
trucks that are there
at the sawmill
and so
if you will would love to see you that
starts at 530 you all have

that so thank you to

thank you so much for being here we
appreciate you being here
and we have now
with this Rashad
Mahmood the executive director
of the New Mexico local news fund
and mark more cut is
that more **** or
Makati.
Right for costs Mike
Marcotte okay
up the copy your name
so professor practice at the school
of communication and journalism at
UNM so
you know full transparency I was a
journalist for 20 years were the
NPR station in Las Cruces New
Mexico and taught
future journalists so I'm really
grateful for this
and and what we're seeing
now many of us are
seen in our communities that are
local papers are being bought out by
big news corporations and
then what they're doing is they're
wiping out those local news
coverage that local news coverage
altogether and it's
becoming diluted
with national coverage
rather than the local stories that we
all know are happening in our
community so
I'm that was just a little
editorial comment on my
part just in case
you couldn't tell that
but what we're seeing is
really you know for those of us
who are in the legislature
some of us have a love hate relationship
with our local news
mediums but we
recognize the importance of
that being
available to
people in the community as
well mainly in some cases their
only source of news
so really grateful for
you to be here and
and turn the floor over to you
to to tell us about
the local news initiative and
and all that good stuff thank you for being
here.
I think you're wrong yes
okay sounds
good.
It's my first time doing this so
apologies if there any
breaches of decorum or
anything like that I will share
with you go you always go through the chair
first and that's
just so that you're not like personally
attacking anybody yeah
no parent practice
well so I I think I'm good
and I'm just just
getting ready.
So thank you madam chair
so much
committee thank you for taking the time
to listen to this
important topic
wireless
nice
my name is retirement maybe I'm the
executive director of the New
Mexico local news fund
our organization is dedicated
to creating a sustainable
ecosystem of local news
to serve the information needs
of all New
Mexicans as
many of you know there's a crisis
in local news in America in
New Mexico and
especially in towns that have only
one or no local news
sources as at
chairwoman Hamblin alluded
to earlier
I'm in those places news is
spread by word of mouth over
social media and
disinformation
flourishes
many came newspapers are
owned by hedge funds and of clothes
are hollowed out ghost
newspapers whether no
local employees are reporters
left for example
newspapers owned by Gannett in
Alamogordo and Regis
really does so have
no local staff
on the ground in those
communities
while the problems may seem
intractable there are
solutions being pursued all
over the country and right
here in New Mexico
innovation is flourishing in
local news and nonprofit
and other new start ups are striving
to fill the gaps left by traditional
media. As
chains retreat local
independent newspapers are
springing up for example
there new newspapers just in
the last year in Deming and
Farmington.
In addition our work with the
support of national and local
foundations such as the democracy
fund Thornburgh foundation
thank you and as much,
comma solutions
journalism network and others
has strengthened connections and
brought resources and opportunities
to local news organizations
throughout the state.
Southern New Mexico is a particular
focus for our work
so many communities in the region
don't have access to high quality
local news and
because of the media market boundaries
they don't even get New Mexico based
television at rely
on the occasional coverage from
el Paso
our southern New Mexico journalism
collaborative strengthening the
ecosystem there but
more support is obviously
needed. Well
it's easy to focus on the challenges
that we're all familiar with I'd like to
spend more time talking about
opportunities and
solutions
in just one quick note in that
packet that you
received there's the
first map is a
map of but
called news deserts
which is a relatively new
term
there's Center for the study
of journalism that
has let down its sort of a nation
wide data analysis looking
at on a county by county
level and as
you can see on that map New
Mexico has many counties
that have literally no sources
of local news anymore
many that just have
one
and that understates the
problem to an extent right
because
some of those that's that low
that one source of news is just
in one town so if you live
outside that town somewhere else in
that county
than.
You know. You're
basically out of luck you just
word of mouth is how you find
out what's going on right.
I'm.
So all around the country local and
state governments have seen the disastrous
consequences of the decline
of local news and ask
themselves what can we
do New
Jersey was the first to launch
an initiative
it's called the civic information
consortium and
that program provides direct
grants from the state legislature
to support civic engagement
projects
New York City was the next big
initiative they
director decided to direct
half of their marketing and
advertising budget
toward community and ethnic
media as opposed
to channeling it towards
larger chains and
TV stations and things like
that I'm
inspired by those efforts
we at the local news fund began
reaching out to legislators
my colleague mark
laser
whose on a well deserved
vacation at the
moment has
spoken to several members
of the committee sent back
chairman him when I know he's spoken
to you
are a we have a southern New
Mexico project coordinator Diana
alba solare former
journalist was also
spoken to some of you from
southern New Mexico and
now I'm
and I'm.
We start talking about what would
make the most sense for potential
state support here in New
Mexico and
the overwhelming consensus was
that we should ask for
support of our fellowship
program
and so that is the focus of my
comments today but I'd be
happy to talk in more detail
about our other work
later
the fellowship program places
diverse journalism students and
graduates from UNM in
New Mexico state eastern
and any graduate
from public universities in New Mexico
is eligible to apply for
this program
this helps keep young graduates working
in our state for the long term
of the first 16 fellows in
the program that have completed
at 12 of them are now
working full time in New
Mexico newsrooms
although actually I'm counting el Paso
which is just over the border
but.
And the new and has grown we had
33 newsrooms apply
to host follows this last
year
which is basically almost
every local news are
in the state so
it's the program is definitely
working
and
news organization the benefiting
communities are benefiting
are providing opportunities for diverse
New Mexicans to enter journalism is
another important goal of this
program starting
a career in journalism often required
unpaid internships or
connections that were out of reach for
many and 7
over 2 thirds of the project
participants in this program
are people of
color. In
addition our local news fellowship is
inspired other states to
consider funding similar
programs there's a
loose network of organ it
organizations around the country
similar to us
supporting local news
ecosystems and
through those discussions so we
helped inspire fellowship program
in California that
ultimately received $25000000
in funding which
is obviously
slightly different scale
what we're talking about
today it's
administered by the university of
California Berkeley so similar
to the model that we have with you
and I'm administering the
program
Washington state recently
passed a similar program
Oregon is also considering
one
I provided a handout
by there's a national coalition
called the rebuild local news
coalition that were part of
that focuses on how
policy can support local
news and that has a
few highlights from
all around the country of different
programs.
Today I have with me professor Mike
Marcotte of the university of New
Mexico
and he's gonna talk a little more
in detail about the
implementation of the program
and things like that.
Thanks for shut.
At the madam chair thanks
for having me and and by the way
I'm a career journalist
and most of my career was
and public media.
Public radio and public TV
like we have
here
my name is Mike Marcotte professor
of practice in journalism at
UNM
on behalf of UNM
the communication journalism
department are chair
Dr Iliev Rodriguez
on behalf of my pop a colleague
in running this program
somebody may know from her
reporting professor Glynis
Doland
on behalf of our partner schools
and I miss you and he and
and you especially
on behalf of the 35 young
people who have
come through or are in
our program
now
I thank you we thank you for
having us and for hearing
us I'll
briefly describe how our program
works on its
budget to students
and to newsrooms
and then just a little bit about our
goals and our challenges going
forward.
So we recruit in the winter
we promote our program to
all stakeholders in
particular we're looking for
applicants
undergraduate students
for internships
recent graduates for
fellowships and
local news rooms to host
them. And so
the students and grads we currently
target tend to be at
UNM NMSU
and E. N. M. U.
because of those 3 journalism
programs there
so we do outreach there
we adopted I reached
all the newsrooms in
New Mexico they can be
and
on any platform radio
TV newspaper
magazine
digital
and then a committee of
educators and practitioners
get together and review all these
applications
and we go through a selection
process matching
candidates with newsrooms
looking at their preferences
many factors always
mindful of providing opportunities
for minority and underprivileged
students and
very mindful to help rural
and underserved
communities.
That we announced those matches
in March and
we begin arranging
the agreements
between the news rooms and
the fellow or the intern
and usually those are done by
April that we run a
boot camp
for our fellows and interns
in June
to get them ramped up to
meet their
their supervisors
go over ethics lot of
skills training and that sort of
thing it's a week long program.
And then they get placed and
they start work in
local newsrooms in
June the fellows
go out for 9 months
they're paid for all 9
months and the interns
go out for 8 weeks
8 weeks from June
to July and their rate as
well to
run this
we get a grant
from the local news
fund.
Thank you I don't choose
to pay me I'm on faculty
at UNM so
mostly I'm doing this part my
faculty work
we use about 50 percent of the
grant to cover administrative
costs travel
supplies and the boot
camp but all the rest
of passes through us
to the local newsrooms
who employ
these people
and.
In many cases they will
add money to the
mix so
the money basically comes from
the funder through
us directly
to the working
expiring young
people out
there
this year as the
payments coming directly from
you guys this year or.
Part of that.
No you're talking about us employing them
yeah I know that's a future
possibility if you can.
We're considering that model we see
that that's what California is
doing we think there might be some
advantages in that
it be a little more expensive
but that's on the table for for
discussion.
So yes so that's basically how
it works we monitor them
while they're in the field
they keep track of what
they those stories are
doing we just got there
June reports we've got front
page stories all over
New Mexico newspapers
by our young people it's very
exciting to see them you know
published.
We
and and then we do a
full
assessment at the end
basically it's survey
base we surveyed the newsroom
so we survey the the
fellows and on
a scale of one to 5 with 5
being the highest of this
most recent crop
of both the newsrooms and the
fellows gave
us very high
marks we average about
4.9 on
the so assessment
scales.
Up so I mentioned we've got
35 that have come
through the program 15 are out
there right now
we started with pilot project
of 35
years ago so we scaled
up you know pretty
rapidly
again thanks to the the
funding that were shot and
his crew has has brought
in I think that the
the benefits are obvious
to me the
other graduates of course are getting
internships we've always done that
right but now this is
much more
supervised
they're paid they're
paid at a you know
$4000 for 8 weeks
which is a you know very
nice amount so they don't have to
worry about working
part time while they're trying to
learn
the fellows get paid 20
6000
500 for
their 9 months
which is not a lot
but then again the
newsrooms are paying that much
so we kind of have to
you know sort
of adjusted that the scale
itself there
we turned over $1500
for costs and expenses to
the news from that's hosting
so they could take care of computers
or some other hard costs or they can
put that right back into the
the money that goes to the the
fellows.
So you know
the gross is
tremendous
you know we know.
We know from just
data over many
many years that internships
lead to jobs okay it's
a very high
hiring right for insurance
well the same is true for
fellows
we've been very
successful
keeping those
people not only in journalism
but doing local journalism in New
Mexico which is our
ultimate you know
yes of success
and we have about a 75 percent
success rate I
can't believe some of
someone on to law school
another one on to P. R. that
pay so much more
you know but 75
percent is pretty
good. And
of course the newsrooms
benefit
not only by just having
you know a
worker
you know because these
newsrooms.
You know they're
struggling
you know their business model is
disrupted is you know
they are.
You know they lose their talent
quickly to other
states
you know the treading water in a lot of
cases so you know we're buying
them some time to re
tool to get their digital
came on and that sort of
thing and
these young people stepping
stepping in is really
you know oppressive Energy in
fresh air not to mention
fresh perspective
and sort of youthful
you points that
help inform the culture of those
missions so
newsrooms benefit our fellows
benefit and our insurance
benefit greatly and our school
budget because
it's not enough just to
put together a class
and say bye bye
we touch everything we know
we're we've got the
so much more than that if we're going to
help journalism go well
in New Mexico
we've got to reach out to the
high school so
we are
helping.
High school students and high
school administrators
understand that
there is a pathway to
college into
journalism and
then once they leave the
college classroom door
what can we do to
create a little more of a bridge into the
work force and that's what this program
does
so I'll leave it at
that and happy to take any
questions when it's
my turn. Thank
you.
Thank you so much Mike
I'm so
until this year
the program was supported
entirely through requests
that we received at the New Mexico
local news fund and then we
would you know grant those
funds to UNM for
implementation of the
program
but
in this last budget legislative
session we were extremely
fortunate to receive
$125000
in the junior bill
courtesy of the leadership of senator
Wirth
so thank you Senator
Wirth if you're out there
observing.
R. and we at that
point we became only the second state
in the entire country to
direct to fund a fellowship
program in California beat
us
in the third to receive
direct public support for
local news
the funding allowed us to nearly double
the size the program this year reaching
more rural and underserved
communities
secretary more of the
workforce solutions department has been
a tremendous partner and the
program she
agreed to oversee the state
funding for the program as obviously
it is workforce
training and development
initiative
and
we're just waiting on final
signature to but the funding
is pretty much ready to be
transferred
from
door for solutions department
at sea UNM
and we've also talked with her
about the potential for the
pre pandemic pre
apprenticeship program
that they run
which sounds like it could potentially
be a really powerful tool
to supplement perhaps
internships or even
fellowships because it
funds up to 400
hours of
like early career
work so we're
we're still in the process of exploring
exactly how that could
how we could work together on
that. I'm
madam chairman and members
of the committee today I'm asking
for an expansion of the support
the receive we received last
year if
at all possible
and for the legislature to make
supporting this fellowship program
a recurring expenditure
that'll help young journalists get their
career started for years to
come.
With an appropriation of
$250000 from
the legislature and
$25000 from
us we could
really grow this public private
partnership on
several fronts
terms could be extended to 12
months from the current 9 months
which would be a real
source of stability for these
young people
perhaps most importantly it would
allow us to recruit to
stem follows in addition
to the standard journalism
follows that we have
that could help with journalism
innovation
as Mike said
you know just having young people in
some of the smaller more rural
newsrooms has proven
to be a tremendous benefit
on the technology front
on you know helping
organizations grapple with social
media and just their digital
presence overall
and if we had some dedicated
stem fellows to
really work on back and
on data journalism
on
research
multimedia journalism it
would be really
really great for the New Mexico
local news
ecosystem.
That funding will also support 12
summer internships to create a
pathway towards the
fellowship for students.
The majority of the newsrooms that
host fellows are locally owned
small businesses and they range
from public media to TV
stations to community
newspapers we've
already placed follows in rural
towns such as Carlsbad
Gallup Roswell Silver
City eggs
would
and during the last session you may have
seen some of the fellowship program
in action there were 2
fellows dedicated
to the session Gen
at the
DOCCS
WS from K. U. N.
M. and came to me
and have your guy goes from the
Santa Fe New Mexican
we've already either
mark or my colleague Dan
are myself have spoken to
many legislators and
some of you on this committee
I'm grateful for your bipartisan
support of this important
work in the last
session
and.
Madam chairman happy to answer
any questions about this
program about our work more
generally about the local
news ecosystem in New
Mexico and
lastly I'd like to extend an
invitation to all of you
and attendance we're gonna
have our very first
summit on local news in New
Mexico on September
30 at
UNM's look
technology and innovation
park
but it's the first time we're doing
something like this the
knight foundation is going to be the lead
sponsor actually sore really excited
to bring their support
to New Mexico
and our goal is to bring together
policymakers journalists
members of the public community
organizations
and create a shared
vision for how we can all step
up and support local news
New Mexico we don't
have a registration page up
for that because quite yet but
I'll I'll send information
to Erin as soon as we have
that she can distribute
it I'm
cert I thank you so much
and I look forward to answer your
questions.
Great thank you so
much
I'm gonna go ahead with the committee just questions
first and then see if maybe
my questions have
been answered in the meantime
so first we have Representative
Garrett and senator Correa
Hemphill and then
Representative Matthews but we've got
other folks who've lined up so those are the
first 3 so Representative
Garrett you go first.
Thank you thank you so
much for what you're doing
it was teaching our journalism
and teaching one out for
me however
I use journalism to
teach
madam chair just have a few
questions
a you don't have your contact
information on.
A good journalists that are
I will I
will I'm I actually
haven't sent Erin a a
digital copy of all these things
yet so I will send that and
include my contact
information and I I
welcome any
direct increases
my for the record my
email as recived R. A.
S. H. A. D. at and I'm
local news.orgy
thank you
madam chair and and our
team
can you say roughly the 35
people how did they spread out now
we've applied for a a little
online new services that do
great job the local
media
how did those 35 people
roughly can you say who
what wear like broadcast
local news
digital
platforms
it's a pretty good
spread just as an
example for
this year of
well you should have
there's a press release that
lists where
everyone went this year
do you have the breakdown
candy my sorry
yes it's sort of a
message list but I
do
I would say
on balance we have
privileged
newspapers
because we have
found that need to be
greater there
so in general
probably more newspapers
than any other
outlet
that said
if somebody New Mexico magazine
right now which is not
necessarily a you know
a troubled outlet
it's a great opportunity for that
particular fellow
we have of broadcast
media ko B. TV has been
a really great partner
they just been really really
helpful you know they just
they put him in there the training
real well and they
and they put on the air.
So the committee now who
just concluded
her fellowship I just
saw her do report
last night from Albuquerque
she's going to deployed
Roswell
starting next
week should be a
bureau reporter down
there
for the first time you've got care
Q. ETV
working with us
cable T. 7
hasn't applied yet
but you know we keep working on
that so you
know the television experience
is very important to
us
but not everybody wants TV
don't get the impression in how
you know. Students
got have that reputation wanting
to go right to the network right
be be an
anchor
but.
We also
talked them into
things that they
didn't know they may want to
do
did you ever think about doing
radio because we've got a great
radio station
kiss part Santa Fe or
K. U. N. M.
KRWG
so you know in a
couple of cases
we had a young man
who we kind
of talked into the program because
he's very talented
and he didn't know it but he
ended up loving gal
we sent him to Gallup
independent
so you know everyone
the story
in the match making is kind of the
part of
this
and we just try to spread the
love and we have
had a couple people at the Albuquerque
journal they've been very consistent
but again it's not like we want
to privilege the
more like well in
doubt meeting state we really
want to try to
you know see what we can do to
reach rural
areas eastern New
Mexico has been a really tough
one
just you kind of asking about sort of the
patterns right we have
yet to get eastern New
Mexico university
to give us a fellow
okay they're trying
I'm sure they'll do it next
year we we did a road trip
out there we're doing everything
we can to you know
you know creek methadone
but by not getting students
out of you know the Clovis
area
Tallas
therefore we've had trouble
placing students
in that region and
we lucked out this last time we
we did get a fellow
returning student to it
actually graduated about 3
years ago maybe
4
happen to be
married to a
man based account and therefore
space so we placed
her at the eastern New Mexico
news and they were so
delighted they think they were ever going to
get a fellow but we we made it
happen so
thanks a little lock a little
magic
I.
I did some really quick
rough math and I think about 80
percent have been
newspapers with the RAF
well maybe like 75
percent with the rest
you know TV radio and
now online.
Online only news outlets
thank you just one more question madam
chair for so
thank you for doing this
the first amendment rights to free
press so vital
to our democracy so thank
you and there
several people here who sit
on the finance
committees of the Senate and the
house. So
you're speaking to people
that are interested in
where we put our money
and if you need your money please
contact me.
Thank you so
much.
Senator prehensile
thank you madam chair thank you
for the information
newspaper
how I grew up that's part of my
childhood my
dad was there for
suspend editor for the
Silvercity daily process
he grew up in
north early Spanish
with this first language she
spoke learn to speak
English in elementary
school and I'll
never forget the smile of the
newspaper coming home every
every evening
so it's near and dear to my heart
and I know whoever
tells the stories
rules the world.
So it's so incredibly important
to and there are some
unique challenges
to journalism in
rural New Mexico certainly
because you don't have a lot
of opportunities
for advertising
and so although
I love
the fellowship program
I see some challenges
with that in a rural
community like we don't have any
housing and solar
city and
just so getting students there
and getting them housed and everything
can be the unique
challenge right
now to to
the housing market
so
one of the challenges
that I see for the local
newspaper is if
there's an important
story that
needs to
be
written about state
corruption in the community
or something like that and
not is somebody
who
invests a lot in advertising
that can be a disincentive
for writing
of the really transparent
story and
so what how
would you recommend
you know navigating
that in addition
to you know navigating
the anti donation clause
and how can we as a
legislature
help to support our
our news outlets
newsrooms
across New Mexico so
that they can really
the that voice for
democracy.
So sure it's just a little
piece of metal let you just get
really to make Madam
chairman.
I I just wanna speak to the housing
in particular Silver City
because Micaela for hall
the was that fellow of
ours and we deployed her
to Silver City
fixable the
editor down there
rates to
help maker Michael
cyberattacks sorry
arranged to provide
housing for hers of
you know he sort of had to you
know lean in
and
help.
But we did discover that these
9 month fellowships
do kind of make it a
bit difficult to sign a lease
right where is 12 months would
definitely be a nicer
fit so it's not
the only reason we're thinking about 12
months you know stepping up to a 12
month fellowship model
that that's one of the reasons
it helps with housing
Nick also is
now
publishing the Deming
headlight and
we have on your lawyer
right now
deployed there and so
she's doing a fellowship in
Deming
housing wasn't easy
but.
Somehow she figured it out
and I think working with the elder
non Tomasz us down there
they stay figure that out
too so
up by
having you
know somebody like witness
who's managing this program
who really cares
about you know these young
people getting
involved and
sometimes Gwen Ifill kind of
work on the the newsroom
supervisor to make sure that
news from supervisors kind
of doing what they can
to to be a
facilitative
you know like I say everyone
is sort of a different situation
but we manage it you know
pretty hands on up close
and and the
adaptive
the ethical considerations
about
in order re advertiser
all I can say that that
is
that's the nice thing about
going to college you
get the ethics you get
the law okay
I have nothing to get somebody going
straight from high school
into journalism
got bless some you know
good storytellers
you know they can quickly learn on
the job
but I feel strongly that the
university has a place in
this so that they're taught
you know the
ideal model if you
will and that's also
having sort of a strong
court of ethics
so you
know you tell the
truth to be accurate.
And you know if an
advertiser is going to take
revenge it may not be anything
you can do about that but the
citizen right theoretically
would be better off having known
what the truth is.
I'm in addition to that
so stepping
back to our broader
work. Out of
our mission is
connecting
journalists with each other across
the state and creating a sense of
community in we're
extremely fortunate
that we have an incredibly
collaborative mindset
among most journalists in
New Mexico alright you
know partly it's because there's a
little competition right
everyone has their with their one
town right and so they
get along
and so one strategy
that we've actually helped
in the past on very
similar issues is
because we have some of
the statewide nonprofit
investigative news outlets
the the social connections that
we've helped create among
journalists a
publisher in that exact same
situation said to
one of the nonprofit statewide
nonprofits like
guys there's this story
that I'd love to report on
but they're one of my biggest average
I mean they literally said this you know they're
one of my biggest advertisers
and I'm in a bind
but I'd be happy to you know off
the record share what I know
and get you started the
story and
it worked and so we've
had stories
published by you know it's
either I think in that
specific case I think it was our
New Mexico which is that one of the newer
ones but the same
phenomenon could work with
searchlight New Mexico or New
Mexico in depth or New Mexico
political report and
so you know
we're very fortunate have the strong
sort of dual level
infrastructure for news in the
state where we have the statewide
organizations focus that
can sort of parachute and
resources as needed
to do local stories
as well as of on the
ground smaller local
news outlets.
You also brought up anti donation
clause.
And
so
until state money entered the
picture we didn't really have to wrestle
with that.
And and just so you
know you know a year
ago we also put
forth a proposal through
the research and
public service project
process at UNM
the R. P. S. P. process
sure many of you know about that
I did until last
year
and we
were kind of ripped on
our funding model
because we
didn't.
You know it looked like we were you
know sort of taking state money
and handing it over to a
private enterprise to employer
people up
so California
got around that we're
the university of California sensually
is the employer
they provide their
fellows they recruit them
they hire them
and then they place them
and then they have a working
agreement with the local news
room to train
them and you know
kind of put that to good use
and so.
In our.
Future
modeling.
I mean. You
know somebody just to sort of help me figure
this out because
right now we're sort of you know
alright Elena funding and
part he WS
funding
and at present
it doesn't seem to be a problem
the way it's set up I don't
know why
you're. But
but
that. We're
mindful of that and we're willing to
go to this you know we
employ the model it's
just we'll drive the cost up
because employee
at even a
temporary 1 year employee
at UNM still
is going to receive
40 percent budget in
on top of you know just the
base salary
so you know 4030
$5000 1
year
fellowship will actually
cost is closer to
$50000
we were okay
with that if we can basically
raise the money.
Thank you madam chair thank you for
your responses that one
last question
where does
the salary for
journalism sering
a journalist range right
now.
So.
It varies a lot by the
medium
but for entry level
newspaper journalists in the state
unfortunately are
making very little
especially in more rural
areas it can
be as low as like 25
to $30000 for entry
level journalist in a small
town paper or something like
that obviously
the bigger newspapers pay
more
that would be more like 35
to 40 is
a 40 might be high actually for
starting journalist's
job
public media you know because
they're part of Italy's
hacking UNM came to me because
they're part of the university they pay a
little more and obviously they have great
benefits so that's
and then
TV you know
the producer the entry level
producers that you
know these files would often start out
as
I'm not sure exactly their salary
I would wager it's in the
like 30 to $40000
range as well
but you
know one thing that I'm super
appreciative of source New Mexico
doing which recently started
is they made a you know
they're funded from national
sources they made a
serious commitment to
rate their
reporters but they need to be
paid and so I believe
they start around 60 or
$65000 a
year which is you
know frankly what it should
pay to for the you
know knowledge intensive work
that that people are
doing yeah
what quick anecdote
anecdote is we sent a
fellow out to
Edgewood
and you know we're
only paying $26000
for that 9 month experience
and the editor there says well
that's more than I'm making.
How my supposed to think about
this we said well
you know we're paying it
and.
And but when all was said
and done the editor
made an offer to keep
that fellow
on on staff
it didn't work out but at least
the offer was made so
that's what we're up against
you know thank you
thank you madam chair it is more
than what we make as well
so. Well given
that it
anything is
worth.
Thank you senator Correa Hemphill
Representative Matthews and
representative Armstrong and
Sierra.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you presenters for
the information
I do have a background in
journalism I worked my way through
college
of as the
college newspaper editor
and working for
the local newspaper my
hometown and
then when we came to New
Mexico I work
as of
a reporter and editor
at the Alamogordo Daily
News
and I think that there
I managed to make $1000
a year so
which is more than I'm making
now so I've gone the wrong
direction.
I I have a
couple questions and let
me first ask a
of.
An ethical question
somewhat different than
what was closed
before.
One of the things I learned in
my years as a journalist
isn't there is often
tension if you will
between the press
and government and
politicians.
And.
It's the model
that you're describing sounds
to me a little bit
lied.
This program using
government money to
subsidize an
employee of a local
news outlet.
And is.
And does that in your
mind or could
that there has it
caused any ethical
issues is it the
kind of thing
where the newspaper
takes a position.
That the government doesn't
like.
Could you talk about that a little bit
because this is kind of an unusual
arrangement it seems to me it's a
major concern.
You know who have a
long history rate
of you
know. For the
state right we're
we're our job is to pull
government accountable
we don't
want to be seen as
you know. Getting a
favor.
I come from public media
and we have a
history
of
having money
go from Congress
through the independent corporation
for public broadcasting
which administers the money
and then goes to the
local public
radio public TV
station
and so the public radio TV
station which
are all trending toward local
news now
I mean the the only.
Point of having public media today
really is to
supplant the
loss in the erosion of local
journalism.
So so
many many many many years
of you know being in the
space and arguing
for independence
of the local
news room.
And so there's just
there's no.
There's no quid pro
quo right
when we agreed
to take money from department
of workforce solutions
and I was shown the contractors
that you know we need to
have language in
there that makes it absolutely
clear to anybody who reads
this that
our independence
is a short and
respected.
And. You know
workforce solutions had no problem
with that and so
we created what
I think is some prototype
language going
forward
to assure that we
are independent.
And
yeah basically independent
respected and
our independence is is
respected because that's
what's necessary to
do the public service that we
do. So
it's a built in tension I think
it's always going to be
there
but I think you know lawmakers
understand you know
how that works and journalists
understand how that's work how that
works you know Dan void
just announced his departure from
the Albuquerque journal I'm sure
many if you notice
that
and
I didn't see of
a bunch of notes like
good riddance
you know in
state reg now is
you know from lawmakers like
thank you for doing
you know strong
necessary
fair and accurate
you know report for
us so.
That's the that's the answer I've
got.
Go ahead.
I'm sorry did you want to add something
sorry then
there
I'm I yeah
I would just add that we also
you know as Mike said that
it's written into the memorandum of
understanding
but also there's years
between the funding
and the actual journalists doing
the work right first of
all.
The editorial control is
at the you know the editor
of of that fellow right
and so you know there
salary is
obviously completely
independent and not directly
impacted by the
state
and then the funding is
you know from the perspective
of the news organization and the fellow the
funding is coming from the
communications and journalism Department
right and so
obviously.
Mike has no agenda
about what that what
those fellows cover or anything
like that and
so I'm
confident
that.
There's enough layers of
insulation to to prevent
from that concern
you know if it became
a situation where
I don't know like a third of the
newspapers budget
was coming from you know a
program like this you know then
obviously it would start
to to be a serious
concern and we have to think really
deeply about it but with the
current fellowship
structure
I'm personally just very
confident and from talking
to journalists and editors they're
also confident that they
can handle that.
Madam chair presenters
thank you for those answers to
the problem might be more
some politician
upset finding
that the public money was
used in other words a
editorial or something
bashing that
person
and then realizing that there was
public money going
to the to the newspaper
but thankfully nothing
like that's happened and I'm sure
that that
nobody in the current legislature
would ever do
that.
They would rather not be
here.
We appreciate the audience
and it really
is sort of the state of things
had. You know
I mean I'm steep
in the
literature of the conversation
about journalism today
and we have
been tiptoeing up to
this conversation more and
more and more over the years
because of
and that is why a
lot of commercial like Salt
Lake Tribune you know
went to a non commercial
model so more
and more receiving our journalism
last as a commercial
enterprise perhaps as
it once was
and more and more as a
public service
that we need for our communities
to go well and I think
in there is the
justification you know
for this this arrangement
thank you madam chair I just
couple other quick questions
first of all I'm I was
clear how many
local how many journalists
through your program are currently
working
in the state.
How many people are involved
in this
program.
Okay let me ask you
asking those that have
gone through the program how many
remain in
employed in
journalism now
I'm asking how many
is excuse me
Madam chair of
presenter I what I'm
asking is right
now today.
What is the number
of the
subsidized.
Employees who have
participating in the program
as well as 15
this 7 fellows
and 8 in terms
and madam chair
presenters is that sort
of the the normal number
roughly 15 at that it
was that was doubled
thanks to the
legislature's allocation
of $125000
we spliced it
into we went
from a selection process
where we're picking for
fellows and
I don't know like 3 in terms
and
basically
added the money and we able
to almost
double the
the the number of
deployed
students thank you thank
you madam chair
and are
are all the
participating.
Press.
People local news on the
local news rooms what whether
their TV radio or whatever
are they all locally
owned or.
A focused on New
Mexico like a
peak at NPR
station in New Mexico
they're all definitely focused
on New Mexico a few of
them you know the Las Cruces sun
news has had fellows in the
past they're owned by Gannett
and for unfortunately.
But remember Gannett
owns what 7 papers in
New Mexico so
you know we don't discriminate
against going out because they're not
locally
owned.
And madam
chair
it. In
my last 2 questions
are it seems to
me that one of the
problems
with.
The lack of individuals
going into journalism
is that the industry
is particularly as new
newspapers
and local journalism has
really just shrug so
much.
It's and so my
question
is.
Is a problem really that
we we don't have enough
people who are willing to go
into the profession
of local news or
is the problem
really that local
news as a
focus is shrinking
and being replaced
by
basically kind of national
models.
And IT I'm
kind of really asking
you what's
the future for
local.
Journalism where
we it's it is
radio or TV or whatever
what's the future for local
journalism
in the
world as we see it
moving and the
industry.
Yeah I'd be happy to talk more
about the so this touches on the rest of
our work beyond the
fellowship program at the New
Mexico local news
fund
you know for a long
time.
People saw the decline of
local journalism
and you know really
throughout the late
nineties 2 thousands
it was just sort of seen as this
inevitability right that
like so you know
Facebook and
Google are going to just take the place
of local news and all the great
technology will solve all of our
problems
and then you know there were
a few voices in the wilderness you
know I think really like shouting
out that like you know this this
is a serious problem for our
country
and you know I'm gonna be
Frank that really was the
2016
election that shined a huge
spotlight on this
obviously we've had support
from Democrats and Republicans
for this particular program and realize
that on the local level
the access to local
news information is a completely
bipartisan
issue
but it the election
really shined a light on
wait what is going on in
local news how are communities
getting the news and information they
need and so we've
increasingly
seen.
Interest from foundations
and funders all
across the country
in stepping up and supporting
local news you know we are
actually a project of the Santa Fe
community foundation
we're not our own nonprofit
just as an
example.
And you know
R. support comes
from making foundation,
comma health foundation sees the
importance of local news
nationally we have you
know the knight foundation that's investing
in the macarthur foundation is a
huge investor
and there's a currently a national
initiative that's just getting off the
ground called press forward
where the macarthur foundation
is seeking to raise
$500000000 to
support on the ground
local news throughout the
country
and you know we've been in talks with them
about how big of a priority
New Mexico is
and so you
know ultimately as as Mike
hinted at earlier I think we're
going to transform to a society
where local news is
seen as a public
service similar
to you know like the
library or
you know your local homeless shelter
or food bank and
that you know there will
still be obviously there's always gonna
be a place for for profit
local news outlets
but I think increasingly we'll
see nonprofit models
or or models that sort
of blur the line
between nonprofit and for
profit
in that.
Fundamentally money
from the
communities that have resources
are gonna need to flow
to communities
with less access to
local news and information for the
sake of equity I
mean that's frankly that's the mission of our
work that's why so much of
our focus is on
supporting rural
local news outlets as
because that's where it's needed
and I think if you have an
equity focused
mindset then you
need to look at you know where
is the need the most and
then you know channel the
funding
there
and it's going to be a fundamentally
different situation than what local
news looks like right now but what
we're already seeing
it.
Yeah I just add
on just a little bit thank you
for the question it's
it's essential
existential
questions.
I wake up with
and ask every day and it's been
sort of a slow moving
crisis but
now when we talk about the local news
crisis most
people understand exactly what we're
talking about we've got to the point
where you know there's sort of that critical
mass I mean use really
start to see the loss of
content
you know for a long time reader the
Albuquerque journal you know you see
that the news you
know shrink
I just wanted to add
I mean if you don't mind my just
let's we've got 6 more people
and I do want to be cognisant of
time and I also know
as fellow journalists we could talk
for a long time one
right all of us going to and was
that the journalism
schools are
kind of reflecting this crisis
by stepping into the space
with kind of innovation and
new projects and new ways
of approaching at
and you and Jim is one of those
journalism schools that's trying to be
proactive
and not just look back the
way we used to do things but figure
out new ways
to approach the
problem thank
you. Thank you
thank you madam chair for the
opportunity to ask questions
thank you very much Representative
Armstrong thank you madam
chair I just have
a few questions I thank you
for The presentation we I think
we all see the
the problem
I in my I live in
this big red
County
close to it anyway catching
County that has no news
media there was a local person
there that did it weekly
and you know the cost just
was.
And too much for them to keep
going it
other how do you
see the difference
between.
Digital compared
to actual
paper compared
to radio
and and do you cover all
those aspects.
I'm we at the local news
fund we we support
local news in any
form
and so you
know separate from this program
we are actually in the process of
launching an incubator program for
local news start ups
we're not seeking public funding for
that.
But we
we order some incredible
applicants actually like
we saw someone in order that want to
start a local news outlet
there
mountaineer has a new
online news
outlet so
I I'm in all of the
above percent
whatever is best for that
community I think is the way
that we would work with encourage
someone for
a lot of people print is still
you know it's how they've been used to getting their
news and so that's great for a lot of
other people you know
online is
great
and.
Yes if if you know of anyone
that's interested in getting
started
in net
County you know please send them
my way I'm happy to
talk with them brainstorm
potato try to put together some
resources that that's what we do
so thank you thank you for that
I was also curious
on on how
the 2 of you match
with the New Mexico local news
fund and then
with Mike
doing the perfect food from from
in a UNM so
how does that work how does that
work.
Well you know it's a
partnership
really
and I I think I indicated I think
local news fund really has kind of
brought the money
and we bring the mission
and you know and
and we've got the
students and so
really
and but you
know the sort of a
tangled story that kind of goes
back quite a ways I mean I was
involved at this as a consultant
in doing some of the scoping
of the problem in the state
that got me sort of into the
conversation with some
funders
then.
Your predecessor
really got the local news fund
started that I sort of stepped away
from that is that will let me put on
my university happened see
now how you know we can work
together
so
so it's a great that our nurse it it's a great
partnership
and.
You know we could arrange a different
ways to me they could run a
fellowship if they really wanted
to but I heard you have the
people that you have access to
the gap so it's closer
aligned with our mission so
where did
the
how did how do you sell yourselves
how do people know
about the local news fund
how how do people find out
about this.
We try to be pretty proactive
you know we
we read well at this
point pretty much every local
news organization in the
state I think is pretty familiar
with our work you
know there is a trust building process we
got started in 2018
and so you know the first year
2 people are like 0
we know what is this new
entity that's coming into our
state with you know money
from national funders understandably
so
but I think you know through
our efforts like the fellowship in our
other programs we've earned the
trust of local news
outlets
and so we work really well with
basically everyone I would
say there's a few
news rooms that you know we keep
reaching out to that haven't
quite. You
know participated in some of our programs
yet but I'm I'm sure that's
just a matter of time
and we encourage anyone to reach
out of again I'd be happy to
talk more about our work
with anyone one on one
thank you I look forward to
madam chair to your contact
information so I can share that
with some entities in my
area and so
coming back to the
25000
who did that go to U. N. M.
or did that go to where did that
money go to
so that money suse
General money for the
workforce solutions department
the workforce solutions
department
is in the process of
signing in and you with U and M.
and it's gonna go straight to you and
I'm so we're not gonna
taxed that
money this
year but in you
know we're open to different structures
you know like we could apply
if we could.
In the future workforce could issue an
RFP for example to
run the fellowship
program and then we
could you know week and others could
apply if anyone else wanted to run
the fellowship program thank you I was
just curious how that that
got through in mind that fee
to. Thank
you madam
chair.
Thank you Representative Senator
Tallman and then Representative
Ortez.
Representative Martinez if he
comes back in the room and then I'll finish
so.
Thank you madam chair I
have a brief.
I have a brief committee 2
quick questions this is a
very important issue to
me.
You know without a
learn important public democracy
dies in the state of
democracy is dying
because so many people are
misinformed and
uninformed a lot of door to
door it
said it's
tragic.
Home
misinformed and other
important people are even.
My district has both upper
income and lower income
the upper income people are normal
better informed in the lower
income people and
it's disheartening
and tragic
how uninformed.
People
have a long history with newspapers
starting when I was 10 years
old.
A delivering newspapers
door to door and that's that was
72 years
ago.
And one of my customers
was up
dina the Syracuse
University
school of journalism which is you know
is one of the top
5.
Journalism
schools.
In the country I'm the
only one of my call the secretary
still takes a
has the local
newspapers
delivered in one of the city
manager.
For many years I
doubt in my
smaller communities I I don't
almost on a daily basis with
newspaper reporters
but then I got the bigger cities we had
a public information officer
in more than 0 Illinois
we were covered 30
years ago were covered by 3
of daily
newspapers
it was in Connecticut we
had 2 dailies
and they still have to delays
in southeastern.
Part of of
Connecticut which is very
unusual.
So.
Yeah it's the newspapers
in a long history with the
chair the question
is.
If I don't know that you were looking
for money from
the state I
would have gladly
contribute how did you get the word
out you said that center Senator
Wirth that contributed
money.
How did you get the word out
this is the first time
we've done something like that so we
were kind of Ricky's I would
say and
we're
we we
met with of as a lot a bunch
of legislators one
on one and reached
out
and
we're we're going to do
a better job this year so I
would encourage I would be
happy to talk to you
one on one at some point and we can
talk about. Madam
chair and
that.
These said
this year you got to receive
250000.
No I was out for
us.
It.
I.
Well let me just
say for that reason
our PSP process
that UNM the
internal UNM process
we asked for $500000
right
so and we have a plan where
we could spend
$500000 on this
fellowship program it would
entail a pretty radical
growth of the program and you
know basically establishing
a center at
UNM.
We today I
was I've throughout
$250000
as a more
reasonable amount
I don't how do you decide
like what to ask for right so don't
ask for it you won't get it yeah I know this
is public radio so if you don't
ask you won't get it so don't
don't be shy yeah
and and I think I can echo
Senator common is that
you know and and all of us are
experiencing we have an
influx don't
don't shoot low.
Just to let you know thank you
thank you madam chair be
sure to ask me
make sure I give you money
thank Russian if you work for
searchlight and in New Mexico
in depth yes we
do.
They have so much you're obligating
the bios of some of the reporters
are pretty impressive
the pin that you know in
northwestern.
Rochester Syracuse
Columbia real the top what
gets a top
tier.
Let other people reported
on the top journalism
schools.
I yes No we're
super grateful that
there exists the state
level nonprofit
news outlets because
they they provide a lot of content that
the local newspapers
and things like that and run because
it's free to to run
and so it's really
making sure that we still have
a. Like sort
of a 2 layer local news
ecosystem
searchlight New Mexico in depth
find doing a lot of investigative
reporting that some
some legislators might have mixed
feelings about
and then that
lets the local news outlets really
focus on their their
communities so so you have
provided.
Under written it in turn
yes there was
to New
Mexico in depth has hosted at
least one fellow
2 fellows
certainly had an intern I
believe they
have the
found money elsewhere and
set up a fellowship
that's independent of our
program and
the we
had
of the same fellow played both
programs and he shows
searchlight which we're happy
for but
there they set a very nice
model and they
have gradually
gotten solid
they've got traction they've
got good
people
and they seem to have weathered
sort that 5 year
mark that's very difficult
for a start up to you know to
get over
but they're probably still pretty heavily
reliant on
philanthropy.
Insurance thank you
for both of you for being here and
thank providing an
interesting information thank
you.
Thank you Sierra Representative
Ortez Representative Martinez
And then all finished.
Thank you madam chair thank
you were shut and Mike
I'm looking at a job
description for the tass
news they're
looking for a
videographer they're
paying 34
to
$36000
a year which is about $10000
more than the starting
journalist that is
not a living wage I want to
continue to talk about the money I'm
so glad as senator credible
brought it up what are
we gonna do to
how how can we have these
conversations are you having
conversations with the publishers
of the editors
about how
to lift up and you
know lift up the
salaries of these journalists
who are in the field working
so hard these are these are
wages that I mean
the qualify for
public benefits and not to
mention the housing crisis that
we're also having in
house what are your
plans to.
Have these conversations
one
small answer
is every year if we
can just kind of keep inching
up what we're paying our
fellows they
go into these newsrooms
you know if they're
paying you to pay a little more
than survival wage
you know we might
be nudging
the the overall pay
scale at that local
news room so
but by not sort of
giving in to
like in a race to the bottom kind
of thing but but sort of
leading with what
we think we can afford
and we can sort of like
raise the Barr incrementally
at least through the fellowship
program we can do a little bit of
that. But
also just you know make the
point.
These are talented people
and especially our diverse
workforce is in high demand
elsewhere and
so they are but you
know.
If they can be
put pretty
readily okay by Denver
or wherever
so you can work to keep
them and I think
you know there's been this kind of increasing
awareness right just since
the pandemic you know
I mean and the the
job right of jobless
rate being so low now you've
got a valuation who you
have
and I
mean this other economic issues
obviously that are affecting this
conversation but
but I hear you loud and clear especially
in a place like house that
has a high cost of
housing. Thank
you yeah I would I would just
add that obviously publisher
is. Want
to pay their staff more
if they can but
the economics are just so brutal
right especially if you're
a smaller outlet
it's like could I have to
reporters that are poorly
paid or one that's
like you know
pay better
you know those are the margins that people
are working with right and
so that's why
part of our mission obviously we'd love
to see you know
an abundance of funding for the
entire local news
ecosystem throughout the state so that
people don't have to make those
calls
and you know I am
fairly optimistic that
this new press
forward initiative is gonna bring
in hopefully a
significant amount of money for journalism
in New Mexico from national
funders
that's partly why we're having this
conference we're gonna someone from the knight
foundation there at the conference
to sort
of really show them like look
this is what's going to challenge
these are what's this is what's going on
on the ground in a rural state like
New Mexico
we need your support
but then also raising
awareness of the cause
just among the general public you
know
we run and if you're matching
campaign
Center at Tom and
in reference to your question the both
searchlight and New Mexico in depth
participate in where we
put together $5000
of private funding
and then if they can raise up
to that amount in their
community it gets
maxed from our our
support
and obviously if you know if we
as an organization had more money we can
increase our match you know we could go up
to $10000 per news
organization or I
mean I could dream about matching
$20000 or whatever
right and so
you know there are resources out
there.
And especially like the nonprofit newsrooms
do tend to pay better
and since we are sort of heading in
that direction
that's gonna sort of lift
up. Rising
tide that's you
know.
Thank you madam chair I
think the challenge also is
that there's a huge disparity
between the newsroom
and in the avid
folks so I
mean somewhere
between you 500
percent of your salary
differentials so I
think that something that we need to
address as well I'm not sure if
your organization can
have those conversations but I
hope that you can
talk about that at
this upcoming conferences the
that's the biggest that's
a huge challenge
you know I was married to
a newspaper editor and
it was always a challenge
you know they're right there just there's not
a ton of movie financially
and and and that's
really terrible given
the importance of
a free press
to our democracy
and that's why philanthropy
and unfortunately
the government funding
might be sort of now
part of the mix where before it
was pretty much the advertising
revenue.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much for being here
today you know I I think back
to my career I started in
journalism in the nineties
but actually in the third grade I was the
editor of my school paper
in high school of course I was
right in high school I
was the editor of my school paper and
had a column called carry
on and then
decided in
college when I kept falling asleep
in my mechanical engineering
classes that I was in the wrong field
and I need to go into something that I was
good at. And
I gave the announcements
over the the PA
system in high school
and ran the band
and and I'm just the band
around the pep assemblies and so
radio is kind of where I went but
I I think of
back.
Journalism is a different creature
now and
when I started you know
we were in radio and and
I still remember when there was the
conversation about satellite
radio and how
that was going to affect public
radio.
And what we
found
was you know and this
even happens with radio
and the
advent of television
and the first video by the way on
MTV was video killed the radio
star my focus
to bit of trivia today flashing
back to the eighties.
But I I think of you know how we
have to evolve and how
like all of us have had to
involve businesses ahead of all
we've of the conversation today
the conversation about media having
to involve and
how.
I wonder where I would be
if I was if I was starting
and in media
now.
You know because we're
now thinking about all
the the multi levels of
of what
we can do on the internet
and the
misinformation
disinformation
manipulated information
correct information I mean it's all
out there and
so what it's it's
prompting us to be is not
only be dependent on people who were
going to report the stories
and as unbiased manner
as possible although we
all know that there are media outlets
that have certain biases and will report
certain things we know that
that's locally that's
federally Nash
probably but I
think what also
our commitment here as a
committee is
also to recognize that
it's a 2 way street that
we want to support
access to fair and
correct information
but also that we as a committee
need to be informed as
well.
And that's where we start
moving forward
when it comes down to instead
of I think all of us find that we're
in this this market of
disinformation and like
what is real and what isn't
it doesn't matter what political the
political party route we're finding that
all over the place and
so I appreciate the efforts of local
news because I think if anything
what it allows us to do is
consumers is to hold you
accountable.
And make sure that that information
is correct and make sure that information
is fair and impartial
and so I am I am
I always talk about how important it
is to think local first
and
how you know it it
triggers in in so many ways
it trickles down in so many ways
and I find as a journalist I use my
skills that I've learned you know back
in the nineties and used for 20
years I used
today not only as a state
legislator but also in my
job and I'm grateful
for the skills and grateful for what
it will teach young
people but
I also feel that those young people
are future and
if they are this energetic
about getting into
telling.
Unbiased factual
information regardless
of whatever slant is or
whatever whatever's driving
I I feel hopeful
and so supporting a
program like this is important to
me I think
you know with your presentation
today you've got a lot more people
who are now understanding
and interested in your program
so that's certainly something
that should not deter you
to talk to we continue to
nurture those relationships from
this point on not just
during the legislative session because
we all know how
nuts it is during the
session and how we just can't
keep track of things
because we're not a
legislature and we have staff for
just a short period of
time.
With that said there for a minute
of. And
so I would encourage that
but I do appreciate the thoughtful
questions that all of you
brought today and
then I also know will
come from tomorrow and
I'm really grateful for the
attendance
also thankful to
our folks here at CNN who
have hosted US the
staff Martin Nicole
and Erin Bob the
I. T. guy who's making sure that
we're
online.
Also to Scott
in his will prove I do
hope to see as many of you as possible to
some the market tonight at
530 thank
you to taking Scott
and all you're you're creating
for taking care of
us
and the dinner space will be
donated by Jim long heritage
hotels and resorts and
so we get to sample local food
vendors tonight.
And so I'm grateful for that
and Scott thank you very much
of Madam vice chair I don't know if there's
anything that you want to finish off
with
you're welcome to do so.
Thank you madam chair and thank you
for Senators I I think
today was a great day
I think that we got a lot of
the information that
we didn't have so thank
you for the presentation
thank you to the committee
this is always this is
extension of my committee
at during the session and
so very pleased to
see so many of us here
together in this wonderful
space I do want to
add that tonight
for the dinner it's it's kind
of an interactive dinner you will
meet up up
top
and then we'll get
our what is called a hall
pass the HSA
passed within allow is to
go and I think it's
$25
and you can go to
any of the vendor vendors
try different things that you wouldn't
normally try and then
go back upstairs because
this small presentation
they'll be some libations
and we'll all get to have
some some of the more
conversations there so
I think it'll be a fun evening
something kind of different
and I think it really
will highlights
small business
and what can be
done when they all
pull together and
working in one direction so
I look forward to seeing you all there
tonight thank you
all right. Are
already on that note thank you very much
we are actually recessing of
415 I will see you all
of 530 looking forward
to it thank you again thank you very
much John for being here.
