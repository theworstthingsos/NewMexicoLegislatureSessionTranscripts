everybody.
Hopefully this will be our
relatively short
the.
The adoption
of the open meetings act resolution
is what we do every year
it is the same resolution
as has been adopted in
previous
years.
I hope we will
have a chance to to look
at it the
only change on that
and I'm sharing my screen out
the only change on that
I think should
be the the
date which is January third
twenty twenty four so this
opens the open meetings act
resolution is
just to ensure that this
commission
which is not a legislative
committee it's actually
represents all 3 branches
are that it abides by
the open meetings act
without all stand for
questions.
Thank you Raul
Mr Burciaga is
there.
Are there any questions
or.
I'll make a motion to adopt
the vote using
resolution.
I'll second that
motion.
Right that was a motion
by justice Bacon.
And a
second.
We're.
Is there any
objection.
You see none the open
meetings policy is
adopted.
Okay. We
go to the next agenda
item
please.
Thank you madam chair of
the next item is
approval.
To issue an RFP
for master planning and statewide
inventory
services
our little background
quickly we issued
in our P. and 2020
we selected architectural and
research consultants was
not as part.
The contract was issued
June of 2020 it
was renewed in
202122
and 23.
Are you recall
requires the contract what
to bid after the third
renewal. And
so what we are requesting
is approval for the council
service to issue
and you are P. probably
this spring
after session
we will review it in house
but we would take it back to
the commission will bring it back to
this commission with
recommendations on the
bidders and then
allow us to enter into a new
contract for the current
contract ends in June
twenty twenty three
so we're just looking for
approval to issue the R.
P. in the spring
but we will bring
back the respondents
and the recommendations to this
commission.
Well the
fortune.
Thank you Mr
Burciaga.
Questions or comments
from the
committee.
Senator please go ahead
I move that we
approve the
R. S. P.
as laid out by
Representative by a Mr
Burciaga.
I'll second the
motion.
Thank you we have a
motion
to approve the RFP
offered by Senator
Stewart
second by justice
Bacon.
Is there any
discussion.
Scene 9 is there
any
objection.
To the adoption of the
motion.
Scene 9 you've
got an approved.
Motion Mr
Burciaga.
Thank you madam chair
the last
item
on the agenda today
is.
Requesting.
Are the commission to allow
us to use that contract the
current
contract.
For a
school master planning space
use and furnishings
for the state capital and capital
more.
Specifically most of the
work that art has
done has been for
GSD or
mostly
executive agency properties
and buildings throughout the
state but
it is actually open to
all state
governments
and then we the
request basically is
is again for the
commission to allow us to use that
contract I'm gonna share my screen
again just so you can see what we're
going to request.
R. as part of the
contract.
I hope you can see it
now
and.
There should be a a page
here with a
section 2.4.4
that's
identified.
And what this says is
that.
Our will do research
and studies related to state
facilities
specifically this price
here our space
use assessment and
planning.
That's what we would like our
to do for the
legislature
we want to be able
to have our could look
at literally every square
foot of the state capital
and capital north
and make recommendations
on lay out
furnishings
offices are
making better use of
offices especially
in shared spaces
that
they would do that assessment and then we would
bring it back
to the legislature to
decide what they want to do
with that available
space so this is
not something that the
commission
would review after the fact
it would the commission would only be
allowing us to use
the existing contract so that
the legislature can
use those services
are to make
that assessment
R. and the
costs for this will
be paid out of the
appropriation
that was are funded
by the
legislature for
capital upgrades every
year we have
money set aside
specifically for the
Legislative Council Service
to contract
with construction
companies and
the equipment
and
all others that
were we do any
upgrades to for example
H. back equipment
moving offices around
and the like that's always
approved by leadership
speaker pro tem
and the 4
leaders also
anything done
beyond that would be up to the
legislature because it's
legislature's building
again the commission is only
would only be a program if you
agree to let us use
the contract.
But it does not take any of the
money allocated to
capital builders Planning
Commission the money would
be paid out of the council
service
funding are that's
appropriated by the legislature
for capital upgrades
and with that I stand for
questions.
Is there discussion.
From the
committee.
I have a question
Mr Burciaga do we have a
sense for the the scope of the
cost.
Yes we
do
and I want to defer to John
petronas and and
the I do
are
because I think they gave us a
preliminary.
Ballpark figure but I'm gonna do
for them a case that has
changed.
Yes
hi.
Chairman and members the
commission.
This is John Petron us
we we have discussed the
in general the scope
with the.
With the Legislative Council
Service and
preliminary.
The cost
estimate is probably
in the 70 to
$80000
range.
We we would
kind of come
to a very specific
cost based on you know
finally go she Asians and
scope.
Thank you for that answer
that's.
Consistent with my understanding
of what space needs
assessments
should hover around
largely based on conversations
with Mister
Billingsley.
Thank you is there are there
any further comments
or discussion.
If I have a question.
Mr Burciaga and would this
include
give furnishings
plan
for.
Of the for the
capital in the capitol
north.
Is that one of the
the outcomes
that would be expected.
Madam chair when
I believe that was included in
the into discussions
with
our
we have we have
furniture but we we run
out of certain items I think
we're pretty much done with
yes the
this one of the things that
we're looking to consider is that
the.
So that we have now in the
capitol well it
is large the still
functional it
has to be big.
Okay difficult to
move not very
flexible and
doesn't allow the best
use of space
when we have shared offices
so that's one of the things that aren't
would look at to see
what might
what could be used to do
that all the
great thing about art is that
while we went out and
looked for
space planners who could help us
with that most if not
all the space planners we
spoke with so
furniture and we weren't looking
for somebody to try to sell us
their furniture we
just wanted a space
and furnishings assessment
and then there are number
of furniture
vendors in the
statewide price agreement that we could
use to
purchase furniture
again all that would come back to
leadership specifically the
facilities review subcommittee
to decide what direction going
I'll quickly to change furniture a
lot.
Thank you Mr Burciaga
I'm and is there a
time line for
completion of the
study.
Of the space
testament.
I'm gonna defer to John
and and the again I can't
remember what was in
the.
Madam
chairman.
Members of the commission.
We we have not done
is a
specific estimate
but usually
studies of this nature
take from 6 to 9
months.
So we would
anticipate that
work would be
you know within that
framework.
Thank
you.
Right I don't see any further
discussion
so Mr Burciaga
you're looking for a motion
for.
Approval
of.
Would you would you state
the motion that you
need approval of the use of
this contract.
For this
this.
So the request is
for.
Approval by the capitol
buildings Planning Commission to allow
Legislature
namely the Legislative Council
Service to use the
existing contract with
our board
space use assessment
and planning
our for for
space and furniture
specifically.
I move approval of what he
just
said.
Is there a
second.
Thank you have a motion from Senator
Stewart and a
second from Mr
Stewart.
Is there any objection to the
motion.
Okay
seeing none that
motion is approved as
stated by Mr
Burciaga.
Thank you madam chair I one
thing I will add
specifically for
legislators and legislative
staff on on this
meeting is I've I've
invited.
John Andy and his
staff
to be here during the session so
they have an idea of what it
looks like when people are sitting
on top of one another
in all the different shared
offices or even the was they're
not sure
so they'll be around recession
doing an assessment of what it
looks like and then we'll continue
that after session
get a.
Get that done
on.
This
year.
That is great to see I
thank you all will
get a real glimpse
at how you can
cram a maximum number of
people in.
All are working
spots
so
we'll look forward to that
hopefully I'll start in that
house Majority
office.
I could recommend
that
well with that
at is that does that
conclude all of our business
Mr Burciaga mistrust
gate.
It does thank
you.
Well happy new year everyone
and we'll be seeing some of
you very soon in the
building
the meeting is adjourned
do I need a motion to
adjourn.
Okay meeting.
House position
so

Thank you New Year need
everybody's help.
