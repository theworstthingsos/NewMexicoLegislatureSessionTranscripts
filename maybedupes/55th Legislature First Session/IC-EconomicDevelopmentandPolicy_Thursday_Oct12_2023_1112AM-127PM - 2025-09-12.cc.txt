All right we're back from a short
recess
we are online and ready
to go we
are at the
segment in today's
Thursday October 12 here in Los
Alamos we are now at paid family
and medical leave
we have Tracy McDaniel
whose policy advocate with the south was
wins Law Center we
have street and I are the secretary
we've got her back for round
2 very
excited about that we have Representative
Christine Chandler and
representative Linda Serrato
here to talk about paid family
medical leave and continuing on with
that conversation and
so I'm gonna turn
it over to you
Tracy yours looks like it's on
all the time but it is not your
microphone it's just
weird little green button the green
light on their you will need
to push a little talking person on
your microphone
so I'm gonna let you go
ahead and take it over
representatives want to start
this this
conversation and thank you all
for being here today
I think you chair vice chair and committee
it's wonderful to be back and talking
about paid family leave and what it means
for our state what this
policy would do for so many
Wirth New Mexicans today
I will begin with the general
overview of what the bill
is
chairwoman Chandler is working on
this far longer than I have
we'll be talking about some of the
amendments we've been looking at and changes
we've been discussing to
continue to work with the business and
all stakeholders on they're
interested in this and then
Tracy Daniels a selfless Law
Center we'll talk about
the economics at large and some of the
things we learned from the
United States department of labor
and their research they've
done both nationally and
first the state of New Mexico
on but first I want to keep
3 things in mind
and we're gonna come back I hope again and
again on its
solvent like
the national and I'll go in the reverse
order nationally speaking
we're seeing paid family leave
medical leave being passed across
the nation and they have a lot
of the same tenants that we're
proposing in this bill
on that we discussed in the past
upwards of 12 weeks
the requirement of a health care
provider to.
To to approve that
Lee are expanded
view of what family include so
not just parent and child but
grandparent like in
the domestic partner cetera
a lot of these tenants that we're
discussing today
remain the same across the
nation and so we're looking at
consistency that is a consistent
element it's like
they had pulled businesses
before it was passed in after
10 states where it was passed
and like you Mexico there
was a lot of fear in a lot of concern
about the no what they
found in survey after
survey is that businesses
either have a favorable
opinion of this public policy
afterwards or they have
a neutral don't even think about it
opinion that it is it is that
in the regular for them
in addition they also found that
it does not cause any
significant or
any
losses and small businesses people
are not losing because of the
the cost or anything they're
not losing their businesses because
of this policy that
is just not happened anywhere that's
the evidence we have and
finally it remains
solvent in every
single state we're paid
family leave is law
it has remained the fund itself
has remained solvent at
a cost of a contribution of
upwards of 1.one
percent combined
between the employer and employee
are pro the one that we're proposing is
point 9 percent
which is less but again it is
consistently remains all that we
talk about solvency a
lot and it the evidence
shows that it remains
good in that sense
so we understand
a lot of the concerns to come forward
chairwoman everyone as you know I've
carried a number of bipartisan
business friendly bills to increase
the amount of capital our state and
supporter businesses in these trying
times and
it's why we've included businesses
every step from initial task
force that included chambers
of commerce included labor
unions advocates
that was underneath the the
secretary's Department workforce
solutions at every step they've
included and continuing onward
as we continue to look forward to the
future. But I want
to take you through what this bill is because
last session we saw there was a lot of
confusion about what this
would cost of the spit so
join a vision workers
New Mexico Tina
and Tina works for Chandler Inc
wonderful company to work there
for about 3 months but she's
been a worker for 6 months so she's been
paying and paid family leave for about
6 months she suddenly
gets a call from her dad and finds out
that her mom had a stroke
and in this moment should
unexpected Chandler ink is a
very friendly employers she
gives her a few hours ago and
check on him on and in
talking with her mom and and
heard in our government's Care her
mom's doctor her dad
and she realizes she needs to take
some time off and the immediacy
to help her family get through
these initials of moments of
this so
right away she then submits
a a paid family medical
leave important
to the department of workforce
solutions and it has
a doctor's note from her mom's doctor
that says in this time Tina
will be doing these things for her mother
should be actively helping and
she doesn't need 12 weeks
23 weeks what we get through the
initial of physical
therapy in these initial times
her job is protected and
she gets to take this time
now Tina so she lets Taylor
no challenge no and and she
gets the time off Tina earns
$25 an hour
and so for the past 6 months
she's been paying per month
$20 into the PMLA
Fund if you ever go to
McDonald's that is a big
mac. Kids
menu happy
meal and that's it $20
once a month and that's which is paying
into it for this
she never thought she was going to use it you
never expected everything else
is much never expected she needed to do
this but in this moment that she
needs it that happy meal
big mac cost is now
ensuring that you will still
earn around 2350
while she's out because she
earns the full minimum wage
which in New Mexico's $12 an
hour and then 2
thirds of for the rest of her paycheck
which ends up being around
2350 her
employer on the other hand isn't
paying her a dime during
her 3 weeks off
or 3 for 3 weeks out I
should say that's
$3000
Chandler ink would be paying her
while she took time off and families a
good employer they would have given it to are they want
to they want help but
they don't have to pay that $3000
anymore in fact they've been paying
$16 per month
into the fund less than every
who but we just talked to this
it's very it's a it's a formal peace
for them and and instead of that
they have $3000 what
is challenging to that it's up to
Chandler Inc they're not paying the
state she's getting paid directly from the
state she now the
internet cannot as side
instead to
save some of that money use
it for having employees cover
other costs for that money
various different things
they could even say we're gonna give you more
time off if each if Chandler and
decides to it's entirely up to
them. And at the
end.
The and and by the
way if they have less employees for
less employees like 2 out
of every 3 businesses in the state of
New Mexico they're not even paying into
it this cost them
$0 but
instead they still have that
that secure $3000
they would have used
otherwise.
childhood experiences
overall but really it
affects a wide
number of
of.
Factors and a young child's
life it really creates
stability allows time
for bonding and attachment
and provides
economic
security for that family
during this really critical
first few months
that then play
into reduced
abuse rates even further
Otten still.
In California they were
able to see
a.
Decrease in tight
end abusive head
trauma hospitalization in the
first second year of life so
well after everyone had returned
to work we're seeing
the impacts of that bonding and
attachment
that happen in those first few
weeks few weeks and
months of life and so
that's why I came in in
in in passionate about working
on this issue but now I
see so
many other impacts
and I
I'm part of that sandwich generation
I was just on the phone with my mom
who is preparing for a major
abdominal surgery
in 2 weeks and
was asking me you know can you
be there with your with your
father while I'm and surgeries
can be 6:00 hours
so you know these are real
issues for not just
for young children but for
those of us who
have
aging family members
who we need to take care
of
so
that's how I came to this
role have
gotten
really involved have and
for done
and have been involved in
the task force as well
as lots of
other aspects
of the policy development
and so we have
recently did started
been doing I.
series of town hall listening
sessions around the state
and I've heard a lot of
misinformation about this
bill that I am in my
presentation
slides
intending to sort
of
dispel some of the myths
around this and and
so on in the
packet that you have in front of
you the first 1
is 1 of those
so in
2021 the
healthy workplaces Act was
passed in New Mexico
and people at
the time thought that this was an
either or either and sick
leave or paid family and medical
leave and 1 of the
the pieces
that I've heard a lot is you
know. We
have that already widely need
paid family and medical leave and
so the first point that I
wanted to point out is
that this is really a
complimentary
policy to the the
healthy workplaces Act
so for
myself and if my
my mother
I can take sick leave
to care for her and to be there
for my father during her
surgery.
She's going to have 6 weeks of
of care giving
respond that will need to
happen at home after
the surgery my
father is there if you
weren't I would need this
so that I could be there to be
her primary care giver she
lives thousands of miles
away from the rest of our family
so
that the states that
have earned sick leave
laws there
are 16
of those I believe
and
of those that have paid family
and medical leave all
but 1 also had
earned sick leave and
most of the time those
policies the earned
sick leave was passed prior
to the paid family medical leave
act being
passed
in Colorado these
were both done by ballot measure
on the same day
in November of
2020 they both
passed
and passed
overwhelmingly as
a valid measure you know
regardless of
whether
there was that mostly
Republican or democratic this is
really a bipartisan
issue
and and I think that's an
important thing to point
out. I think
that the Representative
said covered
on this the
third slide here
well what the
proposal that we have
so Senate bill 11
and
2023.
We have 3.
I merry causes for leave
that are
across the board in every
state those are bonding with the new
child through birth or
adoption caring
for a family member with a serious
medical condition or
managing an employee's own
serious medical condition
the task force in
2022
took a look at other causes
for Lee causes
for Lee that have been considered or
have been passed in other states
include Lee necessary
due to domestic violence sexual
assault or stalking
that 1 is important
to me I I previously
worked as a
crisis interventionist
long ago and far
away
in domestic violence
and actually lost 2
of my clients to
homicide in their work places
because they were in
our domestic violence shelter
but they had to continue going to their
workplace everyday so
there was 1 place that there
is abuser new
that they are going to be and they
lost their lives at their work
place so that was not just
an impact for them and for their
family but also for their co
workers for their
employer in for any
clients or patients
or customers
that happened to be there at that
time so
that's 1 that
it's a very very small
percentage of
I think in
Connecticut in
2021 I looked
at the data they were
1010
applications for leave in their
entire program for
that but it's it's
critically important for those people
who who need to
access that
the other is very meant following
the loss of a child.
So it provides a
percentage of income to
employees father on P.
FMLA leave.
And this is a
second
piece of misinformation that I'd
like to dispel
so
where it it's paid
through small
contributions from employers
and employees as Representative
Chandler pointed out those
that have fewer than 5 employees
would have that
contribution way for the
employer and the employee would
still be paying in and still have
access to that
fund.
When a person is taking
leave they
are applying to the department of
workforce solutions and they're
receiving their
wage replacement from
the fund in the
employer does not have any
responsibility for paying
that
I'd have been
surprised that everyone of
these town halls that there's been
at least one person who
came and really upset that
we expected them to pay to
people during this person's
Lee and said how do I I
the contribution
rate not a problem how do
you expect me to pay
this wage replacement as well
and my answer was we
don't that's that's
the entire purpose behind
that the fund
and so I just want
to make that crystal clear
that that's the how
this works and it's structured
so that the employer has that
wage savings to
that's freed up
to.
Pay over time
re invest in other ways into
the business
and if it's appropriate or if
it works for the business model to
hire a temp
what we see in other
states and the US
department of labor spoke to
this
recently when they presented to
the legislative finance committee
is that most
just
figured out and we're already
figuring it out right I've had
a co workers who have had to take
leave and what we do
we.
You know still work
as a team and and figure
out how to make how to make get
the work done anyway
what this does is just
provide that safety net so
that people are coming
back to the workplace after
those those leaves
happened.
C.. So
the next slide slide
for
shows the
contribution and
benefits again
important to to keep
in mind that these wage
replacements here that we
have so 0 percent of
minimum wage of $480
a week up to the
maximum of
$997
as the weekly rate wage
replacement is coming from the
fund not from the employer
and what the employer is paying
instead
is.
If they have more than 4
employees they're
paying for that minimum
wage $99 per
year and
272
I'm sorry
$207.44
for the state average wage
for the employee it's
a it's slightly higher Stewart
point 5 percent for the
employee.
And point 4 percent or
4 tenths of a percent for the
employer.
I'm I I this is
just and Representative
Taylor pointed out
the first time this was
brought up for study
by the legislature
was by at the time
Representative Mimi Stewart
in 2002 that
was white house joint memorial
51
and since then there have been
lots of studies and
task forces
and work that's
happened to the first time that
a full comprehensive bill
was considered by the legislature
was in 2019
and it was
considered again and 2021
and 2023
and 2022 and
that inner in the short
session there we
said it memorial 1
was the first sponsor on that
was president pro tem
of the Senate Mimi
Stewart
and that was the paid family medical
leave task force and I just
wanted to talk a little bit about the
process of the task
force.
On slide 7
you'll see the task force
composition and as
Representative Taylor pointed out we
had I chambers of commerce
a small business owner
as well as to
representatives representing
labor
and 6
advocacy organizations
as well as the U. N. M. pure
of Business and Economic Research
which is been doing our actuarial
and economic
analysis
for I think since
2016 at
least
on paid family
and medical leave the
acequia association and the
department of workforce solutions
came to the table we were able to
have some really good
conversations about what
administration looks like
what the staffing needs
will would
be
and what the I. T.
system
infrastructure build would
look like and
so we have a really clearer picture
of what this would look like
bait from that the task
force and the decision
making I
think.
And that process was
intentional
and
considered so we
started with
H. B. 38 which
was the 2021 version
of paid family medical leave
and you know that the task
force was established
because we had heard the same
concerns the same questions
the same
issues coming up over
and over in committee hearings we
were saying okay great come to the
table and let's have conversations
about this and
no 1 did until we
put them into a
a memorial and got them at
the table and so we had these really
good conversations about those
issues that have come up multiple
times
and we worked to the extent
possible to to
to develop
consensus which we defined as
80 percent concurrence our
neutrality
there were some issues that came
up that we brought
up and that
were of.
Quickly we were able to
reach consensus that we set those
aside and went deeper
on those issues where there was
still disagreement and so
some consternation
and so.
The for those
issues there was a
of my vote that
was done electronically
and there's a task force
report that
that is available
publicly if you just
Google
2022
P. FML task force report
New Mexico you'll find it
it's on our website as well
at the law
center
so that slide
9 and this is just
an example of the
the some of the considerations
that we had this was around the
maximum length of
leave
for the state programs
across the
the country in that the states that
have these so
we took a look at those and
this was
before I think Delaware
Minnesota and Maine where
passed
so but we had the rest of
these
and you know we took a look at the
maximum length of leaf we also
took a look at those minimum increments
of Lee but
we you know look
at what the range
of options were and said you know what's
reasonable what's reasonable
for New Mexico what will work
for us and
you know in this
example.
Most of the state you know you
can see
12 weeks is really that the
floor
for what these have
some of them you know California
has 52 weeks for the
someone's
own disability
as well as 8 weeks that family
leave many have 6
in as a bird island
6 weeks for family 30
weeks for the your own disability
no more than 30 weeks
combined so
12 weeks is
really the floor of what
we could
expected in to be clear
that 12 weeks is for
all causes of leave
so if my mother
had this surgery coming up
6 weeks
of care giving
their and something
else happened I would only
have 6 weeks remaining
for that the
year
for mice myself to take that
leap. So
you know that that's
really that the foundation
of how we were making decisions
and really made sure
that everyone felt
heard so the
recommendations
like I said we had those 2
additional causes for leave for
remote following the loss of a
child only necessary due to
domestic violence sexual assault
or stalking the
task force recommended there
too Asterix here those are
both things that have been changed
since the task force
but the task
force recommended a minimum
increments of leave of 4:00
hours which FMLA
leave can be taken in increments
as short as 15 minutes
which
might make sense for unpaid
leave but if you're thinking
about the department
of workforce solutions cutting a
check for 15 minutes at
minimum wage probably
not worth worth
that so
you know Wheatley said that
minimum increment of 4:00
hours that
was later amended during the
legislative session at
the request of a
business interests to
8:00 hours to
again minimize
the administrative burden both
for the department of workforce solutions
and for employers
they created a solvency
adjustment formula that will be
done annually
that.
Well ensure that the
the funder main solvent over
time again those
funds have been
remarkably
solvent
across
states
the end including during
COVID which I think was probably
the biggest stress test we could
imagine for
these and
what actually happened in
Rhode Island in California that
have these well
established programs
they had executive
orders that said that
folks could take advantage
of the paid
family medical leave program if
they needed to stay home
to care for children
who can't be in school
because of school closures
etcetera and that
took the burden off of their
unemployment insurance systems
and actually decreased the
impacts of to those
funds while
also remaining solvent
as paid family medical leave
funds so I think that's an important
point to point at important
point.
And so we really feel confident
in the solvency
of the fund based on the
actuarial analysis done
by UNM bureau
and was more recently through the
US department of
labor.
And another change that
has been made to the 2024
version of this bill
again because we feel so
confident in that
solvency and we can
say
we can cap in any
increases that we might
expect that might happen
on contributions
at 1 tenth
of 1 percent of wages per
year so that would be $1
for every $0 of
wages is the
highest that the increase
could be
and so to lessen
the concerned for
business owners in in to really
ensure that this is a
stable consistent
anticipated expense
that they can see quarterly
that isn't going to
suddenly ballooned are suddenly
you'd need to pay somebody
who has this
situation because this fund
is in place and and that
takes the burden off of
this individual business
owner.
The read the
waiver of the Inc the
contribution for those with
fewer than 5 employees
which is 66 percent of our
businesses in the state
that won't have to pay into this fund
at all
but their employers
employees would still be
paying and
and.
It would also that waiver
would also include those
who are self employed or self
employed people
as well as tribal governments can
choose to opt in
to paying into the program to
have access to the
benefit
and the self employed folks
would also only be paying a half
percent rather than a full point
9 percent.
The minimum of 90
days of employment before job
protection is required
for employers
and then extending
the implementation
timeline to allow for 6
additional months
from
implementation
from the.
Rulemaking being complete
and then that would be 6 months
for public education
employer education technical
assistance support
all of those things before
contributions would begin to be
received and that's really
something that we heard
it as a concern
from the healthy workplaces Act
implementation that people needed
more time to be
able to understand
what their rules at their roles
and responsibilities were
through the program to be able to
get up and running confidently
and so that's
you can see here the implementation
timeline.
The.
So pay
and slide
11 if it's
passed in
2024.
An advisory committee would
be appointed in July of
2024
there would be a year
for initial
staff hiring rulemaking
the IT system build
final rules adopted July
twenty twenty five and
then we have that 6 months
to make any
tweaks to the I. T. system
get everybody up and running
understanding how the
system works what their
roles and responsibilities are before
contributions would be
received and then there would be
a full year between
contributions beginning in
the first claims
would not be received
until January of
2027.
So if we pass this
in 2024 it won't be until
2027 that anyone
can benefit from this so
you know I really feel as
a strong sense of urgency
there.
The next section of the
presentation
is really focused
on economic
development why we're
here right
but you know I I
think that that this
often gets lost
in the
debates in the concerns
but this really
is good
for overall economic
conditions in the
state. States
that have this have seen
that we've been able to see
like Representative Serrato
pointed out
that.
Employers even either
say that there hasn't been
much to change at all
or that there's a positive
impact on it by
having this this program
in place
we see
improved workforce
participation for parents
including of course
mothers unpaid
family caregivers and
individuals with chronic health
conditions
improved employee recruitment
retention morale and
productivity and that includes
for those people who are
bridging the gap when somebody
is away on the from that person
comes back there
without the
turnover they're able
to come back together as a team
and have better productivity
and and morale moving
forward.
This I
can't remember which of you pointed it
out but
the the importance of
this for our small businesses
who are competing
with places like
Netflix and Facebook
and NBCUniversal
who of who we've recruited
into the state that offered
some of the most
robust.
Los
Alamos.
The who offer some of the most
robust and and I'll talk about
that in just a minute.
The kinds of paid parental leave
benefits that
our small
businesses here just cannot
possibly
afford to pay out of
pocket and so being
able to provide this makes a big
difference.
And then like I
said
those being able
to respond to
address
disruptions like this
experience with COVID and
and I already have talked
in a bit about this
the States that
had this during COVID it
remains solvent and they were able
to take some of that the
pressure off of their unemployment
insurance systems
slide 14
is focused on women in the
workforce in this state I
actually pulled from an
interview with
US the former
US secretary of
labor
Tom Perez
who.
Late a lot of the salad
and.
That you know mothers are
40 percent less likely than
other women to for
participate in the work force
in the end.
Women in tech which
is you know a high
demand and highly
skilled kind of
industry half of
women leave by the
age of 35 and that's
because they
can't.
Care for their family
and.
Participate in this and so having
access to this kind of benefit
can really help us with
recruitment and retention of
women particularly
in high school highly skilled
fields so.
8 secretary press
pointed out in the in
the interview that I that I just
referenced is that in
2000 Canada and the
US had similarly
workforce participation among
women in
Canada they
have continued
to increase access to paid
family medical leave budget I
think total
for both parents
I think they're at 18
months for
parental leave
following the birth of a child
and but they've
seen in in
response is that they
now have a 7.5
percentage point higher
workforce participation among
women then the US
so if the US had kept
pace by 2018 they
were we would have 5.5000000
more women in the workforce
an additional $500000000000
in GDP.
And there was
a an estimate done
by a national group last year
that showed that we would have
47000 more
workers available
for work in the state of New
Mexico if we had access
to this program based
on the data that we've seen from other
places and so
secretary hired her
her last presentation
mentioned that
we have currently more
positions available than
workers to fill them
this could help to
alleviate some of that pressure
on the work on the
on the system.
So in California New
Jersey 8 they found a
20 to 50 percent reduction
in labor force attachment 5
years after a woman gives
birth in another
study has found a 7 percent
decrease in the likelihood women
leave their jobs to care giving
responsibilities related to
a spouse's
serious health concerns
so it really keeps people in the work
force the
next slide is
focused like I said on some
of these
companies that we have
recruited in and
we also have our our
state of New Mexico the
City of Albuquerque federal
government all offer 12
weeks of parental leave
UNM offers 4 weeks of
parental leave and
then Netflix offers
unlimited paid family leave
in the first year after
birth or adoption they're
doing it because they can afford
to and they're not doing it
out of the goodness of their hearts they're
doing it because it's good for the bottom
line. Tonny
Crans there's a quote
here.
Said when a
Netflix announced
this
this policy change
they said our continued
success hinges on our
competing for and keeping
the most talented individuals
in their field experience shows
people perform better at
work when they're not worrying
about home so
giving people that space
is good for the bottom line
they see that and we see that
more and more in industries
that can afford to do so they
are so by creating
the state system and investing
in this we're really
lifting
lifting up small businesses
is being able to compete for
for employees with
these larger businesses that we for
created an.
Next I wanted to touch
on some
of the.
It affects on health
care and social service
utilization so
access to having this
in the post partum
period is
associated with the
reduced utilization of Publix's
assistance is that budget
because people are staying at hatch
to their employer and they're
able to
have this this income
while they're away on leave
I have mentioned the decreased
it decreases in child abuse
hospitalizations and best of
violence incidents and
those improve breast feeding rates
vaccination rates
and improved parental mental
mental
health.
When folks are a through
this bill is
people would be able to stay on their
employers health insurance
during their leave period
which would reduce
burdens on Medicaid.
It also to
decreases length of hospital
stays emergency ruby
usage and nursing home
utilization among
elders when my parents moved in New
Mexico I said all I'm asking
is do you get it
House without
steps.
Was embarassing floor and we'll figure
it out
and
also I think it's important to point
out that this can alleviate
folks needing to take
permanent disability
so for
those who
have a health condition
coming up they're able to get
treatment more quickly before
it progresses
into something
that's permanently disabling
and so we're able to keep people in
the workforce to other mais
lies might have to leave because
they ignored early
signs and symptoms because they
were concerned a
Tracy before you go on I do want
to have opportunity for
questions so can you go ahead and wrap
up even touch any of the
points and want to make sure you get in
so I did I want to just
go to.
The
department of labor
came and I mentioned this
earlier to the
were on flights let's go
to slide
20.
The.
They have something called the
worker plus
simulation
tool
that and it's open source
and folks can access this
publicly
but you can plug
in.
Parameters
and so the
department of labor and put
put our SB
11 version
of this bill in
and they were able to do
some calculations so
you can see on slide
20
the.
The parameters that they
used to they
used.
The budget claiming right
similar to Washington and then
they had the higher and
lower
uptake rates
on slide 22
so I'm but I'm slide 21 I
did want to point out so based
on their estimations
they came up with
34605
workers claiming benefits in the
year which should be about 5.5
percent of eligible workers
in a total of
38235
claims approved.
And you can see here what their estimated
breakdown of that would be
and an estimate an
estimate of 10.5 weeks which
is actually a little higher than
most but they were trying to be
conservative in their estimates
a as has
you and your business and economic
research so you can
see here on slide
22
they're
expected
middle lower and
higher uptake
rates.
Listed and then the benefit
claims and again it would be a
total of 12 weeks even if a
person took more than one
claim.
And then we can do.
Of slide
2324
UNM's bureau business and economic
research
analysts Susan Ragan who
wasn't able to be here today
she's under the
weather so
any questions about act
the economic
modelling I might be able to
get back to you because I'm
not an economist
but you can see
on slide 20 for
her.
I heard parameters
that she uses for her
estimates
and she's
estimating.
30 5000 claims
per year which is within
let the US
department of labor is
estimating and
then on slide 25 you
can see
her estimate of what the
fund would look like
in years
12 and 123
and 4
of the
the.
This system being up
and running so
on slides 27 and
28
you can see the year 1
implementation costs
so that it
bill does include a
36.$5000000
appropriation request
that would be used
for primarily
as you can see
the IT system build is 30
2000000 of that as
well as planning activities
the rule making
facilities operations
and then you can see the year 1
staffing cost break down
and the.
That year to implementation
costs and the
ongoing
person right of requirements
for this for this
so thank you
thank you very much
we do have questions from the committee
we're gonna start off with Representative
Montoya than Representative
Ortez Senator
Rodriguez representative
Duncan vice chair
guy New Mexico senator Tom
in.
Okay.
Representative.
Some
Hey all right
I've got him behind me
all rights Representative Montoya
you're ready to
go. Thank
you I'm Madam
chair of
Representative Chandler you're gonna get
all of my questions and your partner
left actually
have more questions
for Representative Serrato
but all
of the directing to
you
I'll do my best Representative
and madam chair I'm gonna try and be
succinct so if you could be
succinct with your quick your answers
it would be very helpful because I have a lot of
questions.
I think there's some
unintended consequences
here that
are just not considered
so.
Most of the presentation
has been about
in particular women
and in particularly
pregnant women who need the time
off. A
lot of the information
that we were just given by the the last
presenter was about that
and so my question is why was this
not just limited
initially
to. The
most of the part
that the the ones that would
that
most employers would love to
have a program in place for but can't
afford instead we've expanded
it in it goes way
beyond to extended family
and other things up most
employers don't have
anything even the
really big companies don't
have
for beyond
the immediate family
husband if
it's a woman has been in children
or if of a
man at
the or the husband of
a a wife and children I
I guess I'm I'm even having a hard
time saying that anymore
from the New World
that we live in but
immediate family quieted quite a
to go beyond immediate family
it goes beyond immediate
family because that's what
New Mexicans have
and live with we
are a culture that
has
extended families
cherish extended
families we are not
a state that is
has a high percentage of
nuclear families
and so it would it would
of it would not provide
benefits to a very large
number of them of New
Mexicans who need
a program such as
this.
So thank you for that M.
madam chair and and Representative
or German
chancellor
and then fly
$23
an hour whitefly if if
this was a minimum wage employee
are they getting more
than the minimum
wage
if the in
in pay from the
state
I if I understand your
question correctly
if you're a minimum wage
employee you'll get 100
percent wage replacement
but you won't get more than what
you're earning okay
that is not what I understood from
that was a question for Representative
Serrato she was saying
$23.50
that.
Madam chair and
representative she might have
been referring to
the median age or
medium wage
that are
employees have in the state that may have
been what okay so we're just talking about
wage replacement up
to that amount
yes madam
chair I believe so and
remember it's capped
so you're not going to get it high
income employees are
not going to get full wage
replacement it stops I
believe F. madam chair
at the New Mexico
all of minimum wage
plus a
cap at
the median wage
of the state.
Thank you for that so
madam chair just because I know there's a lot of other
folks on here
I would just like to talk
briefly
about the
other consequences
to small business especially
those 4 with 4 employees
are less.
I I think the unintended
consequence here for those
small businesses as you're gonna
force them all
in the hiring
1099
employees.
And the reason
is
I if I
have let's say I
have one employee.
And that employee
ends up taking that time
off I can't
survive without that one
employee I'm gonna
have to hire somebody
which
means of
the or I'm gonna
have to have somebody else do that work
otherwise I'd be doing it myself
and if I find out that
I don't hire somebody and I just do
the additional work myself I may
not need an employee at all
and that person may not have a
job and have talked themselves out of
a job.
I'm just saying there's other on
intense attended consequences
here that
business owners are gonna look
at the specially that small
that small business owner is
not dealing with high
margins.
I think the likelihood is they're going to go the
route that nonprofits
are which are the
majority of employees are
1099
employees.
And I think that's that's the
unintended consequence you're gonna have
so whatever benefits they do
have.
The only benefit they would have is
this Lee
because if because of
because what I would do being
trying to be as compassionate as I
would be as a small business
owner I
would. Higher
that 1099 employee and
I would help them figure
out how
to.
To go file a business
plan get any I and number
and and become a small
business themselves that way there the
in business there the
employee of their own business
and then there on contract
and then if at any point that
contract is
not being fulfilled.
You're gonna just go hire
somebody else on another
contract I I'm just
saying there the this
is going to
have.
Unintended consequences
and
and Representative Serrato
mentioned that hello
or it was mentioned
that this was
bipartisan but
the reality is I
don't remember this getting any
support from Republicans
in either chamber.
In the last session
and I think some of these things could have
been talked out and if they were
limited instead
of going for the whole
enchilada if this would have been in
limited to
just
women in particular
with children that
have other responsibilities
at or or
pregnancy.
I just had a I I just
had a grandchild so I
I know very well
how my daughter
was having to handle this but
I think that would have been some input
from our side but
in in the end you're gonna end up with
a lot of opposition
because small businesses have more
than just the dollar amount
to worry about
it's it's it's the disruption of
their business and it be a major
disruption with
somebody has for employees are less so
thank you madam chair
madam chair I said
that I will not respond to the
entire but I do want to clarify
something businesses
now have employees that have
to are sick or
have long term illnesses that they
have to address and those
employers whether
there more than
5 for employees or
less than 5 employees have
to deal with the absence of
those employees and they do
so you know using
their best judgment and accommodating
in many ways this
simply provides a benefit
to the employee who would need to take
the time off anyway
because of the illness of pregnancy
a family member it's
cetera so
it's not changing
what happens in the workplace
it just at offer
support to the
employee and it
increases the likelihood
madam chair that the employee
will return to that
employer.
Thank you Representative and thank you
Representative Montoya Representative
Ortez listening Senator
Rodriguez representative
Duncan and there's more to
that list thank you madam
chair and thank you
presenters I I want
to first off by
talk about.
What my.
What my
friend here to my
right talked about
with regard to the non profits
I don't believe that the
majority of nonprofits had 10 and
employees
I mainly
because I know that you're at risk
as a nonprofit running a
nonprofit myself of losing
your status if you continue to
use 1099 employees to do
the work that a
employee that you would be providing
benefits should be should be
doing I mean that's just something that we think about
all the time I have 1099
employees of that
you know that do contract
work I'm I would love to
be able to provide them with a full time
job I can't I but I have to be very
careful about
aligning their
work with
with a contract and not
with the job description
so that's something I think about all
the time and I want
to tell the
committee about
something that I experienced this
this past year
with an employee we have
for
employees at my
nonprofit and
3 contractors
my employee full time
employee took
took leave to take care of
her newborn
I
raise additional funds
to ensure that she could
take that time off per
our new mended
HR policy for 3
months so she got
full time to full time
pay I would have really
appreciated.
Somebody else being able
to pay for her
her time off you know for
her to receive some kind of
benefit from the state
and from what I
understand
you madam chair members of
the if the day is
here
if we had this in
place.
I would not have
had to pay is an
employer with
for employees or
less I would not have had to
pay anything into
this the employee
would have had to pay that is
that the
case
you madam chair and representative
yes you would be exempt from having
to pay in the employee
would pay the point
5
percent per $0
in wages.
Okay that that is helpful I think for
a minute if 2 thirds of our
businesses here are you know in
our in the state you know we
have 4 or fewer
you know there you know we're we're
always thinking as nonprofit is a
business right it
is a where we're Corporation
so you know if if
most of the
businesses in our
state R. 4 or
fewer of those
business owners or nonprofit
leaders are not having to think about
you know having to put aside part of
their budget to pay for to
pay into this fund.
So 9 my next question is
around the
how we generate the
funds for the
fund
in this first year first
couple years will there be
there the state is
putting something
in.
Madam chair representative
yes
36 and
I have at and
$500000000
that that right 6
but 5000000
but I wanted to point out because I don't think
of the point was made originally
madam chair and Representative that's a
loan the
rates it will be paid
back over a
period of 8 or
so 7
years through these
premium so that's a loan from
the state that we pay
back madam chair in the cap
the actuarial
calculations madam chair and
representative take that
into account okay
thank you thank you for that and
madam chair
madam chair
I'm.
There's a figure I don't
know what side it is that shows
that there's at $32000000
cost for IT
can we able to set up the
program it seems
crazy but
also you know things are
expensive so communities can
someone dig into that
practice secretary yes
thank you madam chair I could defer
to the
secretary.
I thank you madam chair
Representative Ortez
it is a crazy amount of money
and things are expensive
so we would try
to capitalize on the
infrastructure of the unemployment
insurance system but it's
fundamentally different
in that we're taking contributions
from employees so
if you think about the
you know however many
businesses we have here in
New Mexico each
having an account in unemployment
insurance and unemployment
insurance to the extent that they
have employees
now you think about every employee
also needing to have an account
and then they're also confidentiality
concerns and screens
and and other states have done this
so we know it can be
done but these figures
were actually based on
looking at the other states and how much
they're built cost them an understanding
that we be able to take advantage of some
of those products
already they have to
be tailored to our system but
this was our best estimate of it
of the I. T. cost and
you know even some of the numbers I
shared in my presentation
earlier we're getting 11
you know we're getting 6000000 from the
feds and a total of 11000000
just to modernize and do
some fraud
prevention work on our existing
you I system so these things are
just super
expensive.
Thank you madam chair thank you
and secretary up
I want to go back to the states that have
both the paid
sick paid family medical leave
in the earned sick leave and they
you mentioned
for prices Representative Rado who
mentioned that that you know the really
complementary
so as we're thinking about our
own policies and should this
pass those
will be able have complementary
policies so if someone
gets sick.
You will
take time off
and it's paid
and if then their
family member gets
sick are they
bound by the 12
weeks
total or are
they. Is
it you know 12 plus
12 someone help me with math
24 weeks
that they could be tapping into
to take time off to take care of
themselves and their family
members.
Madam chair and
representative and I may ask
help from Tracy to make sure
I get this right but so
think about
sick leave as
a one off or short
period okay
so you know your your child
has the flu you take time
off it's not going to count against
paid family medical leave
paid family medical
leave requires
that a provider
medical providers say you
have a condition or
a family member has a
condition that
requires either an
extended period for
an extended period of
intermittent
leave use
so I I know it's
easy to get you know you have
to get your head around that
so sick leave is for run of
the mill you know you want offs
colds that kind of
thing these are
more longer
lasting where you actually have
to go through and
apply so I
because this is come up how come
how is this going not going to be
abuse well it's not going to
be abused because there's a
process of a
medical provider
the department having to approve
the claim there some amount of time
involved in that so for
things that are short term you're gonna take
your sick leave
because we've enacted that
ADA 8 days a sick
leave in the state now yay
but this is for longer term
situations I hope I
covered muted thank you
so much chair thank you
madam chair Representative that's that's
all right thank you
Senator Rodriguez then followed
by Representative Dunkin
vice chair guy ago senator Tom
in Europe in line thank you madam
chairman and good morning to
the presenters Representative
Chandler again
US secretary 90 or Tracy
I think us there Representative
Serrato have to go I guess right
or she's still here yeah madam
chair yes and she just
started a new job you got
some time you know how that is not
only got so much time need to be
here no worries I didn't have any
specific questions I just
wanted her to know that
Madam chairman and the
expressions of the personal
experiences that she's
had truly
resonates with many of us
who have been through this with our
kids and family
so. I want to thank
her for sharing all
that
that Madam chairman and
not show up as we
know businesses
are the employees
and employees are
businesses
without employees
we can't have anything
truly and they all we have to do is
go to a go somewhere
realize if we don't have any employees
everything shuts down
and so in the same that
way with the with the businesses
back. Yes we're
talking.
About employers
and employees
at the same time I couldn't help
but to think that we
all collectively
have a responsibility
to effectuate
these important and
crucial changes
for our families
together we have to
do it together we can
only do this by
developing and joining
in this partnership that is being
proposed.
And otherwise we
we just will not accomplish
it and
I can't
imagine that anyone
would think that keeping
employees.
Anywhere at work
during very
huge hardships
in situations would
be beneficial would behoove
anyone the business the
employee the family or
anyone involved
in so.
You know I believe madam
chairman that several
concessions have been made
already
and
you know if they have been
to accommodate I fully
so in many areas
the concerns of businesses
that have been
expressed in the last
several years this is been going
on for awhile and
so this is not about passing
laws that create a
hardship for employers
it is about positive benefits
for both employers
and employees
and ultimately
in a nutshell
it will provide a
result
in a healthier much
healthier society and
what we have now in more
robust businesses
in happier
employees more
eager to work they'll be
more energy and
more in
just more commitment and
loyalty to their
jobs into the
workplace and I
think when we see that we
see an improvement for all
of us and so I
I just wanted to make that
statement but just a final
quick question I'm gonna move on
because there are other questions were
hungry and we 28 lunch
too so I don't want to get in the way
but Representative
Chandler just clarify
did I hear something
different here you mentioned
that.
That businesses
with for fewer than
4 employees
would be exempt for
for for fewer whatever
but this document in page
I says I
employees
and and so I just want to
make sure the one I
have that was presented
on page 5 of this
one here mentions
it says it
with the key recommendations
to include a provision
waving the employer contribution for
businesses with fewer than
5 and so
is it for I I just wanted
to know
thank you madam chair and representative
of thanks for that question because
it's confusing fewer
than 5 or
4 and fewer
so you can blame us
Madam chair of the house and
we use it we say
it in different ways so it's
fewer than 5 or
4 in
fewer. You
see where I'm going with that it's
it's for an fewer
okay for a few later
manager non 34
I do wants reform
answer. Thank
you very much for clarifying
that madam chairman I
don't have anything else because of
time great thank you Senator
Rodriguez that might be a good point of
clarification if there's that much
conversation about absolutely
pandemic we use different
terminology just
confusing
representative Duncan and vice
chair guy goes senator Tom and
Representative Mason Representative
Herndon Representative little
anybody
else.
We have those all right
Representative Eli
thank you madam
chair.
We heard this in committee in
and.
So I'm gonna I'm gonna
look at it from the
same kind of the same
lands I have
a plaque in my home
this is nor the success
can compensate for failure in
the home.
And as a
father of 4 daughters I
certainly
understand.
The dilemma.
And the hardships
how grateful I am for for son in
laws that my daughter's
home raising children.
And to
they don't have to do this at
this point in time.
So.
I've got some concerns
I like some of the changes
I do I like some of the
changes.
I think that.
66 percent of
the
businesses within the state
I would like to know the numbers when
this is all over implemented
because I think it will be
50.
I think you're gonna lose some
businesses in my
County have talked to businesses and
I know in New there's
no misunderstanding about what I'm telling
them about this
I still think you're gonna get some folks
are just gonna say
it I got a technical
employee that I can't
replace and I have to
train eminent takes 90 days
to train somebody else
I've got to have somebody boots on the
ground today I think
we're gonna loosen businesses a
result of that so and
then.
So I think
we're gonna have a number of people taking
advantage of this and they
should if
if if this becomes law
then they should take advantage of
that. Everything
that you proposed
in all of these other
states.
Can you tell me who the closest one
is to us in
population
and their
budgets.
It's not in here
well it's not in here so
and that's my concern
is the second closest one to
us is double our
population.
Only Washington
DC is less
than us in population and
yet the budgets twice as much as
ours.
That's my concern when you're
dealing with states that have
$100000000000
budgets and we
have a $9000000000
budget I don't
think that this is
sustainable.
That's that's my view I'm not
an economist I'm not a
an account
but I think we're going to run into some
problems down the
road with this because
just to the numbers that we
have and and
I I just don't think it's going to be
sustainable because of the
few people that are gonna be putting
into
that.
So one of the thing and then
all of
a.
Madam chair all all the get
off my
14.
When this
loan.
When we run
into
insolvency.
And this is a loan
so we can call it right
just like the bank
would.
Someone ask
madam secretary how we gonna
call this loan do.
For you to come back to us
and ask us for more
money.
Madam chair representative Dick
and I forgot my normal disclaimers
I want to give that now that I
we're not here is an advocate for the
fill your fact witnesses
on the administration of the
program and the administration is
no position on this bill
that said I don't my other
disclaimer is in can
be me because I.
The insolvency will we come up or
solvency would only come up in
2829
so whoever's
in the seat at that time my understanding
is that the loan repayment
is amortized as written
in the statute in that that there
wouldn't be absent
new legislation
the ability to call the
loan in time and in
times of insolvency.
Chair thank you and that's
that's my point
is that if this
goes insolvent.
The where you're gonna come back
dust mask funds and that's what I
wanted knowing right
from right here in the get
go. Madam
chair 1.if
I may.
This presumes
insolvency
none of the states
that we have cited the 13
states are insolvent
and to
Representative Duncan's other
points that we're small so
we should think small I
don't believe we should think small
I think we should we should be
offering our employees
the same programs that other
states who are potentially
intractable ways to
the state this is a
program Madam chair
representative that has the
potential for drawing
employees to the state and
making us state
of choice for
employees so
let's let's think
in those terms there's no
evidence of solvency
none of the other states have gone
solvent to so to presume
that I think is a wrong presumption
thank you madam chair.
Thank you madam chair
and but but the reason I'm stating
it is because of the amount of people
population and the
budgets they're involved and they're
huge compared to
ours so that's what I'm
saying I would prefer to
take baby steps as I told
the committee at that time and I
would prefer to do that at this time
as well. Thank
you madam chair thank you
representative of I sure Gallegos
next and senator Tom and
Representative Mason Representative
Herndon and then Representative
little thank you madam
chair and and thank you for
at the presentation
today I think
it's really important
to have.
The listening tours I think it's
really important to have the
clarification
and
also
I I'm glad that I'm seeing that
there's work being done
to to make changes
and what I
also want to say is
so I was very honored this
year to to chair
our economic development
committee and so I heard
a lot of
really.
Maybe information that wasn't
quite
correct
up until we heard the bill
I think we had lots of confusion
during the health
I think vice
chair Serrato did
such a beautiful job
during
the committee hearing and
I I wish she was here but but she
knows how I feel about how she did
but I just want to put
it on record that she does such a
beautiful
job.
I think is legislators
one of the things just I want to
share with you as the chair
some of the feedback that I
got
and one is that one of the
things that I heard was
that.
That maybe
the sponsors were not open to
changes on the bill.
And as policy makers
I think you know
legislation always needs
to be fluid
we need to have open discussions
and we need to be able to see where to make
things better for our constituents
and for what works for us
so walking in I I
I really
don't like just hearing
that there's not room for
for at least conversations
and debate and and
amendments and so I just
wanted and it and I see
that chair Chandler's
making a face and I do so
I'm I'm not asking you to I'm
just tell you what I heard
and and so
as part of our
committee there
was to it
I.
If we can't chair or vice chair
us out of 6 of
the members
were are here
today
or also
I and
that's where the bill died and so I just want to make
sure you you are hearing what
what we were hearing
so is so I'm
hoping that's not the case in by
you being here and making
those you know making some of
these key recommendations
for changes I'm I'm
hoping that that's not the
case so disturbing that
one piece out there for you and
I I guess you want to respond I
do since
I I was
busy chairing judiciary
during that hearing but I'm well
aware of the work
that Representative Serrato
and Senator
Stewart
we're engaged in many
conversations with representatives
on your committee in particular
in which negotiations
were being had on
changes and
and it was very
disappointing with regard
to some of those individuals
when we offer to make those changes
and yet they were unwilling to commit
to support the bill
so I mean it's a 2 way street
madam chair
and Representative and madam
chair yourself
that it's a little
disingenuous when I've
Representative comes and works
with a team that wants to hear
genuine sincere
and valuable input
we're willing to do it and
then being told what
we're not sure we're going to commit to support
the bill so
I just want to put down at that
out there as well and
as you can see that I Madam
chair representative of I made a
list of the changes
I probably missed some too
because I am I've heard that
too what we're we're
part over on what we originally
filed we're not willing to negotiate
that is absolutely the
case and that list in
the case that it
wasn't the case but keep
in mind madam chair we
have to be able to sustain
the fund which
means employers and employees
have to pay in
and we have to be able to
maintain the goals of the
program so
suggestions that undermine
those 2 key points
are likely not to be included
in the bill madam chair and
representative.
Thank you madam chair
and
and Representative I a you know looking
at the key recommendations I
think the the
to me it it outlines
a lot of those and I can see
where the changes have happened and
I and I am happy
to hear that and see
that and
would continue of wanting
to to work on like
I said a a living
document
another question I have madam chair
is have you all had
conversations with counties
and local governments
and nonprofits
regarding how this
would affect
day to day
business.
Madam chair and
representative I
have with my local
local government I'll defer
to.
Ms McDaniel
to address that because she's
been involved in a lot of listening
tours thank you.
Yes madam chair
and then vice
chair
the we
have had discussions
so like I
mentioned the City of Albuquerque
has been offering
paid parental leave benefits for
up to 12 weeks out
of pocket essentially
since 2019
and we've been in conversations with
them as well
as.
Nonprofits nonprofits
have been one of the
biggest.
Attendees at that
these at our listening
tors and and
you know we've had a lot of
conversations and
and they've been really
positive and as
some of the misinformation
has been dispelled
there is growing support
and you know what I've heard you know
of course
everybody things
that paid family medical leave is
a good idea it's about how we get
there and as we start to talk
about you know we're not asking
you to pay that employ
the
employees wages while they're
gone
they administrative
oversight falls on the
department of workforce solutions
it's not your HR
department is responsible
for filing an
approving and
keeping track of these
days of
leave
though a lot of
the
consternation of
apprehension
is alleviated
and so that's what I've seen
in those conversations that we've had through
the listening tour
thank you madam chair and and I'll tell
you I run a nonprofit as well
and so I was very
concerned
because I was under the
mis conception
that I was going to have to
pay the
person that was at Lee and
so once I've
I understood that it
made a world of difference for
me
could we
so. And
maybe this may be able
inappropriate but I so I'm
just getting it
but if you don't feel comfortable at
answering that's fine madam
chair
you know you said you've been talking
to the City of
Albuquerque
I would think that now that giving them
that full understanding
and information have they
changed their position on the
policy.
So I haven't
spoken with them recently
this was in
2022 I was
in dialogue with
the policy folks at the
in the mayor's office
but I spoke what I will
say that I think is interesting is
I after I think it was
almost exactly a year to
the date of the time that
the executive order was
signed by mayor
Keller in
2019
early maybe January of
2021 I had a
conversation with their HR
director. One
of the things I think is the most
fascinating
is that they
she she said at that
time and I haven't followed up
cents but
that those that
took the most advantage of
that we're actually
new fathers that
were in the police department
because they're sort of
the prime age and
had this opportunity
for the first time
and that they
you know they were able to even
without a state
program they were able to sort of
spread out the costs and and
make it work they'd paid
overtime and things like that
hadn't had big impacts on
morale or
anything and
these you know young
men were able to stay home and
and bond and bond with their
new children so.
Thank you madam chair I think that's
great
I also
think I I heard
listening you know I I
I I didn't go to the meeting but
I logged
on the
report the LFC
did. And it
seems like they
were talking about a
big budgetary
impact have you
all reconcile some
of that yet with with
them them
I'm matter madam
chair and madam chair
we have looked at that report
and we will be following up with
up with the LFC there are a
number of errors in
their report
and there are number of Roni
assumptions in their
report so we
will try to work with them so they
actually have a correct
understanding of the bill
madam chair and madam chair
so that they can do an
appropriate analysis I would
point out the US department of
labor and bureau
have both analyzed
the bill and
came up with very
similar.
Conclusions in terms of the
fiscal impacts and so and
so on so we have
2 that
are 2 reports
that are sound
and one report
that we have found the number of
errors and will be working with
LESC to make sure that they have a
better understanding of the
of the bill thank you madam chair
so thank you madam chair
and and madam
chair.
Yeah.
Will so do you
think that report will be
provided to
especially our committee
before
you know we going to
session.
Madam chair and
madam chair I can't answer
that you know because I can't speak for
what LFC and with their time
lines are sorry.
Well I think you I appreciate
it I appreciate the work
that's been done
and I appreciate the bill
so thank you.
Thank you Mr Senator common then
Representative Mason
Representative 0 and Representative
little.
Thank you make you madam chair thank
you panel for being here
for your
comprehensive.
Presentation.
So this briefly the state
is 67
percent of the
employees are
not to.
Included in this
bill.
Madam chair and
representative I would
say put it this way
66 percent
of employers will not be
required to pay their share
of the premium.
But their employees are still
eligible madam chair to
take the leave.
So madam
chair send us because
they are some are
ready offering the
program
Madam chair representative I wouldn't
say no I what
it what I'm saying is the
employees are paying
in that the
employees of those small and very
small employers are paying
in they remain eligible
to participate in
our actuarial studies
have concluded that that will
work
financially.
Okay.
Thank you thank you
Madam.
On page
as.
14 H..
Chart 2728
from the
sure that was
presented to us
by
Daniel.
Last year the start
up costs
with.
Somewhere in the 30 to
$35000000
range that looks like it's the
same.
Cost has gone
up.
Madam chair I'll I'll ask
if it's okay miss
McDaniel to address
that. Well excuse
me the
secretary's probably best
suited for that chair
of madam chair senator
Tom in.
We we don't we
didn't think that there would be a significant
inflation in costs in the
out years when
we're paying administrative
costs from the
fund that's when
we'll see the things like routine
wage inflation and all those things
hit but that wouldn't affect the
initial
appropriation.
Thank you for the answer madam
chair and so it has some that's a
proprietary.
A software the
$32000000.
Madam chair senator Tom
and we think that will be
able to build off
of existing
systems but there will necessarily
be some customisation
based on our laws and regulations
and and that part would
be different
of all the.
I was blown away by the
cost of software that's
why because
most of these tech company
executives are are
billionaires.
So okay so thank you
for that.
1.$5000000
for the year one staffing
costs.
So in the second year
you got 216 employees
what what's it whether the the
cost.
Madam chair
Senators maybe get to
that piece of
paper.
Last year was around
30000000.
So we are
predicting
that
in your 1 page
now would be
7124
to the following June so we're
talking about state fiscal years
the cost would be
around 24.3000000
and so that's for
$17000000 of the
I. T. build plus
money to operate the
program because we're at that point
we're already in rule making we're
already needing actuaries party
meeting the I. T. staff
and then of course we have to charge
administrative overhead
based on the federal
funding that we have so
then in here
to we're
looking at a total
of 20
3000000
100 25 which
includes $8000000 of
staff and the
reason that the staff ramps up
in that here is because we
start collecting from
businesses so there's
a period
during which were collecting
to premium.
From the businesses
and and the employees
before the actual
budget starts being paid in the
purpose of that is to build up the
fund and
then we're looking at recurring
costs of a
28.7000000
and that's based on
maintaining I. T.
ops
and then of course you know
buildings all that
stuff because we need space for
this number of staff
and just you were
corrected our estimate is
that can't brief
small but I think it's 207
staff members
ultimately staffing the
program.
Thank you for the answer to follow
up on the vice chair is
question.
About.
LFC versus
a.
Some other
organizations and taking a
look at the cost
so.
So you're confident
to. The
number you come up with come
up with is going to
be. Lower
than what the LFC is
estimating.
Madam chair and
representative
yes in my
company confidence
was shored up
after I
learned that the US department
of labor who looked at our program
was very much in line with the
numbers that were were
determined by
bureau.
Thank you and thank you Mr
reason I ask is I'm a big
advocate for LFC
to do of. A
wonderful job in the one
national award so
I was kind of disappointed to hear
that. You
aren't that crazy about
their.
Estimate but I guess
the. You
can assume you have some folks
look at that.
Experts in this
field.
Madam chair and representative
certainly we've had economists
look at and you
know. LFC
is great but they're not
perfect and we've
all seen L.
FIR is
that have
X. frankly
not proven
to be
perfect let's put it that
way Madam chair
representative.
Nobody's perfect.
Thank you for that answer and and
madam chair I got a couple
more quick
questions are except quick
answers.
So.
Of.
So what's the incentive for
employees to go back
to
work.
Well the first
incentive is most employees like
working so they want
to get back to work I
don't believe that most
people are are gold
bricks so and I don't believe
that's the philosophy of most
workers so that's number one
people like to work it's
the number 2 is
with the exception of minimum
wage employees madam
chair and representative
there's not
up there's not
come how do I say this
is not full wage
replacement because after the
original minimum
wage I think it's
2 thirds up to
a cap so
it's it's not a profit making
enterprise madam chair and
representative to be taking
leave.
Thank you for that answer
and madam
chair.
The secretary that
answered my question about the
number of
employees.
And.
Secretary Stewart
of.
Is
a.
With this program if you
cover this program will help bring
certain employees back to
work.
Madam chair
senator Tom and we haven't
analyze that issue
independently.
Thank. Thank
you. And
then finally.
Quick question a
quick comment
so are the consequences
that.
Would result if we don't
adopt this
program.
Madam chair and representative
then of we're losing an
opportunity to
support employees
and small businesses
and we're losing the
opportunity
to for
small businesses
to.
Have a stable
sustainable workforce
Madam chair
representative.
Thank you for the answer and one
final comment madam chair
I.
Last year I had
some.
Questions about this program
right now is that you've made some
changes and
basically.
Supported.
You know I just
remind.
Time in the legislature
support.
Had a lot of bills
and. And
one of the bills I've used the argument
well you know we're one of the last
states
we're one of what only a
few states that have adopted
this particular
bill.
And I think that happens
time and time again so
we. I
think this is the with the fact
that we're so slow.
To adopt ideas
that are being successful
in other states.
The reason is is a reason
why we rank so low and so
many quality of life
ranking so.
Here's a chance to for
us not to be the last state
to adopt an idea
that's.
Financially is going to be adopted
in every state so
thank you for again for being
here that's all I have madam chair thank
you. Thank
you senator Clemente Representative
Mason Representative Herndon
Representative little and then I'll make
a few comments as we should
all.
Thank you madam chair.
Madam chair.
I have a.
You have made some changes
I don't the.
The less the the actual bill
I guess I'm going to
hold off.
Any any very
great statements on it is
this remember I
would have been less
than a real supporter of
bills but had
one question though how do
you determine what for
employees looks like.
That for full time with the
have 8 hi alright
times or 6
what this for.
Our leader
what determines for
employees that's a very
good question madam
chair and representative
yeah.
I'm gonna ask the secretary
that because there's
probably.
I don't know Perigon Antoine
how do we say but they're
probably.
That's all I need is that
workforce solution type
people reduce
reuse and their terminology
on.
Madam chair representative
Mason said the bill
at defined simply as a
person working within the state
who performs a service for wages
or other remuneration
under a contract
of higher and includes
a person employed by the state or
political subdivision
so just going by
the plain language as it stands
now there's no
difference in some of
the works 10:00 hours a week
versus 40 is the is still
classed and employees.
Madam chair and
Representative Mason is
the bill as currently written that's how
I read it.
You know that the.
That the.
Hope open the
whole different.
All the more you know with
the I would like to see
that. Maybe
if if I had to
go some places work a lot
of part time
employees
you know but they might not
get as many hours as for
full time employees.
I mean it doesn't seem quite
fair
of.
Also.
You know with the
what what percentage of
the people to decide would
probably participate in this
program I mean as far as take
advantage of the program
is it 5 percent is that what you
said.
It was
madam chair and Representative I think the
number is 5.4
percent that was
the up take
number that I remember seeing
from through this I
something I did forgot
to jot it down as was going through
it the.
So every employee
though.
Later on it will hi
there act
percent no matter
what.
So okay.
Even in the little.
Restaurants with
the.
No.
No that's.
It that's one
course as I stated
in the other one you know we've
we've think of this bill
out for the last 200
years without
having to
spend.
$30000000 worth
administration funds to get
it that you know that's part
that I hate within the government
program we spend
a ton of money
to do.
A program on the net and
and it's I see some benefits
but also see
that well 95
percent of the workers
415 for 5
percent thank you
David.
And like in my
business if it's a
restaurant or retail
anything our
calls are
added on to our
products
so love are you
saving money business in the
last 10 years
we've had an uptick to 3
percent in
cost of
employees.
Calls to the business
we used figure 8 percent
our 11 percent what we
figured we had
another percentage on to
that because
I loyally
plays for which
doesn't sound like much
but a lot of these employers they're planted
on the very bottom of the price field
to start with so to
them a lot of money little
bit of money means a lot
don't you think
the cost of hamburger all for the
budget in the year
that's what I'm really came
by
so.
The most of us implores you know
nobody hardly works
one that the minimum wage
but every time we raise
anything it raises
everything
so. Bill
we all end up I don't know what
the cost at the end of
this again this will be for
a cheeseburger $0
with it's already getting
open lot higher than it
used and
everything with that
surprise.
But like I said some of your
I'll hold off on some of
the I'd like to see
the paper
instead presentation
then the for
a is that and
I'm I have some
I will use some
of these changes on
those 3 or 4
Republicans on the committee I
don't know if if I don't think any of
us were asked
to have any input
on the changes
of the bill sure one way I
know that.
And
one.
When there's
a lot of us with
so anyway when
when will the bill be out is
going to be out before
session or.
I'm Madam chair
representative we are
circulating a draft as we
speak I certainly
anticipate it will be
filed early
you know in the in the early
window of filings madam
chair at
all.
Thank you Representative Mason
Representative Herndon then Representative
little.
I was.
Okay.
Thank you madam chair and madam
present is first of all I want to
thank you for your tenacity over
the years and continuing
this project
this very important project
over the past couple
of days
and weeks I've had
people approach me about
the about the family
medical leave paid family medical
leave and I want to present to
you just 3 of the questions
that were raised so that maybe
you can respond to
them up first
with respect to
the. The
fund itself
and the the 35000000
I'm point I
or close to it that the
state would be putting
in the question
that was raised was
about the guard
rails that are placed
on them of
the. On the
fund to make sure
that it remains sustainable
because we do have
66 percent
of our businesses are small
businesses and what if
every one of them
chose to be a part of
this of
this program and all
got sick at the same time
now what would happen and
they're looking that they're looking at like a
COVID the pin or something
else how are
you going to prevent this
fund from going bankrupt
and is the state investment
council involved
in investing the funds
as they are
received.
Madam chair I believe the
secretary volunteer to answer
this
question.
Madam chair representative for and
and I just kind of looked at
our.
So let me be something so
just to be clear all the
66 percent
of businesses are at
that fewer than 5
employees that only represents
8.one percent
of employees
in the state so if
all of them got sick at the same time
fund should be fine
the calculation to
keep the fund solvent
requires basically looking
at how much he paid out
plus administrative
costs which would include the
the amortization of the loan back
to the state
and then you multiply that by
135 percent so
so you got a question there for
claims increasing
unexpectedly
and then there's a cap on the amount
that the contribution can be
raised each
year but
ultimately if something catastrophic
were to happen as it did in the
pandemic M. it
would be incumbent on the state
to determine
you know whether to to make a loan to the
fund because there would be a federal
source the way that there isn't an
unemployment
but you know as as they mention
that hasn't happened in any of the
existing states
as I understand it the this is
not an invested fund
with the state investment council as
it's currently
written in and I think that's kind
that's paralleling the
the unemployment insurance trust
fund.
Thank you madam chair and
and madam presenter
the second the second question
that was raised was with
respect to
the alignment of this
legislation with
FMLA and the
protection of
a job and this
probably follows the question
that was raised by my
colleague Representative
Montoya so that
if someone goes
is approved for the
FAM paid family medical
leave they can get up to
12 weeks of leave
with the job part Texas
is that correct.
Madam chair representative
yes and
they run concurrently
madam chair and representative
of the can't it's not.
Consecutively so it's 24
weeks madam
chair.
And thank you madam chair and and
madam presented so the question
then also rose if
the employee
employer employee
has a sick leave
and annual leave
also available to
them and they want to use
the concurrently with the
paid family
medical leave the
employer is only
guaranteeing their job
for the first 12
weeks can you comment
on that madam chair
yes and madam chair
my apologies I
was corrected the job
protection
for paid family
medical leave is after
90 days
your you're
entitled to job
protections if you
if you choose to take paid
family and medical
leave correct
okay so I just wanna make
sure I'm I corrected myself
because I don't want to mislead anyone
that the second thing is
madam chair and representative I want to
try to understand your question
are you asking
if
you can take a
vacation and
other
leave
of.
Budget that you have to be employed
at at the same time
or after I'm I'm not sure
I understand so I apologize
thank you madam chair and thank you for the
question so that
so let's just take
a woman out I'll give to
you what was presented to me a
woman who has just given
birth to a child 12 weeks
gives a 3 months off what
is 216 months off
and she has an of
a built up sick leave
and annual leave
combined with the paid
family medical leave
to have the 6 months
all the question
was but she's only
guaranteed her job
for that period of time
covered by the paid family
leave to return is
that correct.
I believe that's
correct.
Yes I believe that's correct
okay hopefully everybody's listening
yes yes
and then that thank you for
that clarification so they can take
it if the employer allows that
but the employees I have to guarantee that
job for true and I would point out
madam chair you know leave policies
very from employer to employer
so for example vacation
time you need pre approval for
that so that's something
that's going to be totally within the
control of the employer
you're entitled to only 8 days
of sick leave under state
law so it's gonna
be what's going on with the
employer and their policies madam
chair Representative
and thank you madam chair and and
madam presenter and then the last question
that was raised was
one that you have heard over and
over I'm sure from small
employers who say
look if these employees go
out hi my going to
get my work done
so and of course you have
responded by state but what
if they get sick then you don't even
have paid family leave but
I also want to present to you with
the aging and long term services
division of the state
is doing so they are
and the Sandia
laboratories is
doing so they're putting together
a list of
individuals who have
retired have an
incredible amount of
skills but don't
really want to be fully
retired so
the question still has been
raised about putting
together this program
working with the department of
workforce solutions with the
secretary is looking
to increase the number of
programs that she's engaging
in so that we can
so that these individuals
are available for small
businesses to say will
you come and work for
me for this period
of time it's not costs in the small
business anymore because
they'll be paying the person the
same amount the person
who left the job would be getting
paid and they would have
a credible reliable
employee so tell
us madam chair of to the people
who are listening what is the
response.
Madam chair really
neat idea and I heard
you and LESC make
that suggestion and it's a really
neat idea so thank
you. Thank
you madam chair thank you present us
thank you of madam
secretary workforce solutions
for taking on that
up.
Thank you Representative Herndon
Representative
little.
Thank you madam chair and
thank you
everyone presenters chairwoman
and and secretary
and
Madam there
most of my questions have been answered I
think I'm down to 2 to
one
is
civic can read my writing
as we were talking
about.
Small businesses I believe it was my
colleague Representative Montoya
who was talking about
contractor status
it occurs to me
that having
had a small business it
was a small business and it was
me and
nobody else
so we've been
talking about employees
and employers
is there an opportunity
for people
like I
was
and maybe in the future
for me to participate
in something like this because
part of the attraction to becoming
an independent contractor
has been
what's perceived to be
flexibility I can
work my schedule
around
needs of my family
4 X. that
depending on the circumstances my
own as well
so that would
be that's my first
question and the second
question will
be.
At a what can work
for solutions due to
assist small businesses to
back fill that idea
that we just heard is
wonderful I I like
that and
is is is are there
any plans
possibly to
entertain that idea or
others that might have been
presented thank you madam
chair.
Madam chair as to your
first question
as to whether a.
Single proprietor
such as you your
hypothesis Madam chair
representative yes
that single proprietor
would have to pay the point
5 percent
into the fund the there's an opt
in
process for you know
that first self employed
basically madam chair
representative.
And and madam chair
Representative little at
you know we would need money
to do that so
if someone would like to
pass the bill and give us some
money to do that we would love to explore
that option.
Duly noted
thank you a secretary
I secretary thank you madam chair
great Representative
Zamora.
Thank you madam chair and thank you
presenters.
Madam chair and and
Representative Chandler what
would be wrong.
With letting
people opt out of
this.
At a at a at
a county level
or or something like
that.
Madam chair and
representative the
sustainability of the fund
is of based on
assessment of participation
and and the like
so when you start pulling people
out of the fund
you're adding instability
to the ability to make sure to
make sure it remains solvent
and if I may madam chair
this is an insurance program
and we all know that that's how I
view it it's just like the
unemployment insurance
in in the sense that
some people are going to use
it but everybody's paying
into the fund so
your your
spreading the risk
and your alleviating
the burden on everybody but not
it at the burden is
smaller on everybody
because you're allowing you're
requiring everyone to participate
when you start monkeying around with
that you're going to get to a place
madam chair where the fund will be
sustainable.
And and madam chair
and and
Representative.
I think I've we've we've
all talked to somebody
at one time or other
or they are sick of
all the deductions that they get
from their paycheck.
And.
This is another deduction
that's that's gonna
happen.
In government getting bigger and
and talents small business
what to do
earlier it was
mentioned.
That there was some talk
with Bernalillo county as
to how it affected them
what about the smaller counties what
about the more rural New
Mexico where they
have the less employees
and it's gonna it's
gonna.
Affect them
greater to
have that one employee
out. And
and then all staff another question
on top of that
is if a
husband and wife
have a
baby.
And the wife takes off
for 12 weeks the
maximum allowed
and David is the husband allowed to
take off 2
weeks after that.
Madam chairman and
Representative.
Madam chair and representative
as to your question on the small
County I would
put a small
county similar
to what a small employer is
there they will be paying
into the fund and
their their employees will
benefit I will point out
madam chair and and
Representative what we've talked
about throughout this those
employees are going to be absent
anyway if they have
a of the need to
be absent they're going to be absent
this program does
not create
absences that were
not otherwise occur so
I just want to read re emphasize
that because I hear this often
in the conversations
with regard to the 12 weeks
for
the the mother and then the
12 weeks for the father yes
they with both parents
have if that would be
eligible to take time
off to care for the
child and to bond with the
child.
Thank you thank you for that madam chair
and and
and madam chair
and and Representative with all due
respect and and
we're here to debate
and bring out and
put put issues on the
table but
if if we take a look back
and government in in
history of the government
and how things have
been.
Put in place over the years
through policy
I don't believe government
has supported the family
unit.
And here we
are taking a step back and trying
to support the family
unit. But we're
doing
it.
Through a process
that still makes government
bigger.
And and that troubles
me.
If if if
years ago we
would have supported the family
unit. I
believe would still
have.
Egolf families
we have mothers at home taking
care of their children and
not having to work
and I
see this.
As a push and
pull.
With government and and
how we're trying to support the
family but we never really
have
just a statement out there
and.
As a conservative.
Representative I'd I just
see this as growing
government and
not letting it.
Take care the local of the to
be taken care at the local
level I think
employers have a heart
to and
and I think they could
make smart decisions
as to make.
It fit for the employee
and and their
business the third they're managing
in.
All the I look forward to the
debate the
see how this moves along thank
you madam chair thank you Representative
and and presenters
thank you Representative
just have a a couple
of maybe just
comments
you know I think it's
M. and understanding that I
represent I have a
wonderful opportunity of wearing
2 hats I run the green chamber
of commerce which talks about the triple
bottom line of people
planet and profit
that all of those are equal and
then also in my capacity
as senator so it's a really interesting
thing because the green chamber talks about
locally owned businesses we've had
this this conversation
about the challenges of locally owned
businesses my colleague with the greater
chamber in Los crucis we've
worked really well together and some of
the conversations that we've had
regarding this
are like the specialty
employees that Representative
Herndon had suggested that
idea and
and that's I think the big the big
challenge because the
understanding that it's
it's not like we're going to have this
mass influx of people
taking paid family
leave but we're also finding that their
small businesses that have a hard time
retaining employees
and as much as I like the
affordable Care Act it's awful
for small businesses
it is not the best plan for
small businesses that is out of the
reach of small businesses to for
those premiums and their many
nonprofits who don't have
the opportunity or the the
capital to access
insurance that most
traditional businesses
offer to their employees
as part of a benefits package
and so what's happening is that
small businesses are starting to become
a lot more creative
in what they do to
trying keep their
employees
so there's a nonprofit
Los crucis that does flex time
so that you work
410 hour days and you get
every other Friday off
and employees of really liked
that as an option because
it gives them a 3 day weekend every
other week there's
another business that offers to
help pay for your basic
doctors appointments because they can't
afford health insurance
but they want to make sure that their
employees recognize that
there is. Their own the
business owners
care about making sure that
they come back and
so what we're finding just
because of the nature of the
the climb in them the
the the employee market
now in the employer
market is that small
businesses are having to be
creative and
so what I I feel
is that this is an
opportunity to try and
retain those employees
and we can go off on another conversation
about how people aren't we're having
a hard time getting people to work for us
in the first place is a small
business I mean there's a whole
other just Pandora's
box of that
but I I feel that it's
there are those those
concerns
that small businesses
need to have more opportunities
to retain employees because of
we're talking about people not
wanting to go back to work it's like the ones
that are going to be there that are gonna be loyal
that have been with you for
1015 years
or that are just starting because
they want to get into this
field that they need
to have some incentives to to
keep them there and
when I talked about with the
secretaries that you know we've got a
hot mess in store for us
in terms of employment.
We have to add every
single thing we can and I think
of this of the small businesses that I
represent in the chamber
is like the one
restaurant they train their front
of house employees to be able to do
back of house and back of house
to do front of house
they have a waiting list
for people wanting to work for
them and their
restaurant and
yet right across the street
from them they are
having a hard time getting
employees because they
don't offer opportunities
for their employees to flourish and
grow.
And so we've got this whole
complex conversation
about our work force that we have
to have but I
feel that you know when we talk
about employee retention and if we
start talking about the
ideas of like the
specialty employees dental
hygienists
radiologists you know those
are the ones of the businesses that I I
remember having
the most conversations of
like I can't find
somebody to fill that
spot because
the job that this person
is vacating for 12 to
12 weeks is a
specialty job.
And I really love the
idea of like like let's
start working and I think chambers of
commerce would be willing for doing to
doing that as well and I
I safely speak on behalf of my
colleague Debbie
Moore is
that. We have
to have that pool to
make it easier for businesses
to say this is not
going to put me in a bind
this is not going to stop my
production this is not
going to stall my business
because ultimately those businesses
see that when there is a
slow and what they're there's their
goods and services are
there's a risk at losing customers
which means there's a risk at losing
being able to support their
employees their lively I
mean we see the cycle
and so I think that's
something that
is is a
creative solution
to a concern
that a lot of small businesses have
just in terms of what we're looking at the
work full. And
I hope that we can we can pursue
that and I
think that that's an opportunity for
other chambers is also to
to jump on board with that
is an act and I don't
know what the plan is I
think you know what Representative
heard and suggested I think that's a
really like
yeah that's a good
idea
because those concerns
are legitimate and valid
and so those are the
conversations I'm appreciative of
the conversations in the feedback
and the feedback that you've been getting
from this committee and other
committees of understanding
what the concerns are and the efforts
that you're making
to trying to dress those concerns
because ultimately we
know that there's an employee retention
issue small businesses
don't have the tools to be able to do
that so how can we
help them find those tools
without making sure that we are
also creating a hardship
and I think that's the conversation
that we continue to have
and so I'm grateful for that
so
so thank you so much
for this you you
were here for pretty much 2:00
hours secretary was
here for a whole up in 3.5
so bless your heart your
if you want to have lunch with us
you're welcome to do so
we do have a moment there is
one person making green
are you there in the audience did you want
to do public
comment.
Where you it was it about this
topic when
we do it
now.
Okay.
Okay
so of while you're doing that
because I I do want that the
one thing I think that this is the worst
is like to wait if there's been
a a topic that's been presented
first thing in the morning and you have
to wait until the end of the day to make public
comment I think that's also just
respective time so
while you're doing that
I would like to thank was almost community
development organization
when Herman and Jacqueline
Connolly you
too ladies thank you very much
for taking care of us with
lunch.
Thank you.
Of the rest of our day
well Megan you're getting your
stuff together
you all can go ahead go if you want your have
said here thank you very much
we will have
about a half an hour for
lunch which
seems to be good you all fast eaters
and and also gets us
out of here little bit earlier
we have 1 more day but
just the rest of the day today we're gonna
talk about outdoor recreation in Los
Alamos County and then
talking about food insecurity
in New Mexico
tomorrow just
as a reminder we will have a
panel on public
banking and
I do have a structure that
I will go over that day
just because with
is if you see your agenda
you see how many people are there
I want to keep that is like
moving forward as quickly as
possible so I'll
go over that format
tomorrow morning but I would
like to try and start that
is close to 910 as
possible
and then we do have some
legislation Representative
Montoya Representative
Allison is going to be bringing
stuff up that we talked about
before the format
for that is that we're pretty much just
going to talk for 5 to 10
minutes on each of those bits of
legislation and then
ask the committee to
vote to either endorse or not
endorse it so that will be
like the summary but we've been talking
about that I know Senator Diamond Brantley
also has some legislation
I have a piece of legislation that I've
talked ad nauseam about with
you so
I think.
Will be good on that Megan are
you are you ready come on
up all righty thank
you.
I should have given you a little bit more heads up
my apologies on that.
Okay you can come up here to this
microphone if you
will to the one has the green
light it doesn't mean it's on you have
to push a little talking
person.
And I'm gonna give you 2 minutes
okay.
All right definitely not
from my on
yep okay to go forth
thank you madam chair and committee thanks
for the time to speak today my name
is Megan green I
am the executive
vice president of C. WSFA
the 76 we represent
approximately
30 500 public workers
across the state I'm also speaking
for the president of C. W.
WA
711 robber
Gonzales who represents
about 400
workers in the private sector and
was unable to be here
today
CWE members in New
Mexico stand
together and support
sorry.
Okay money real
fast.
Representative yeah let me
take a breath.
Of these only address
legislative record Megan this
is really
surprising.
Okay
it's supported paid family and
medical leave this act will
provide a much needed safety
net for New Mexico's working
families.
Many of our members are public
servants serving the needs of
rural communities throughout the
state we're cost of living
is often higher
especially in towns like Los
Alamos weather is
one primary employer the drives
up the cost of living as
an environment department employee
in Los Alamos this is something I
have experienced
personally.
It's hard for public workers to keep
up and many of us are living paycheck
to paycheck often one medical
emergency away
from financial disaster
imagine experiencing
a catastrophic accident or
life threatening diagnosis
in dealing with the emotional
and financial helpful from that
only then to be dealt a double
blow of being forced to take unpaid
leave or lose your
job.
We represent members in this position
every day.
We are currently representing a
member who is being forced to resign
after expending her unpaid
FMLA well caring
for a child who was in a tragic
accident.
She is now lost 3 months
of pay and will be struggling to find
a new job or trying to care for her
child who still needs extensive
medical care.
Another member I worked with recently
is the sole caregiver for her
disabled brother who lives out of
state and could not be real
relocated due to specific
needs.
Well the 3 months leave
provided by the federal FMLA
program was sufficient to care for
him losing 3 months of pay
as low wage state
employee it was not
sustainable
and she ended up resigning from her
position.
In this case the state lost a
tenured and experienced employee
who was a subject matter expert
on a complex regulatory
issue I paid a
family policy would
have allowed us to retain this
employee.
Representative updated
yes at its
core this is an equity issue and
C. WA stance in support
of paid a paid family medical
leave act great thank you
so much thank you for doing that
last minute next time I
promise I'll do a little bit
more heads up for
that
any other public
comment.
All right so again
thank you to rent Herman and
Jacqueline Connolly from the Los
Alamos community development organization
for providing our lunch we
are going to recess for
32
minutes.
33 minutes
remember I used as I used to be in
radio so like I talk to the
minutes so we'll
re will reconvene at
2:00 with our
presentation on outdoor recreation
Los Alamos County
so we're going to recess for lunch
will be back at 2.
