Good
morning want
to start it like
dating myself and good
morning Vietnam like Robin
Williams
says.
Whenever we set up our budget
we think in economics as well
we need to hire people to do the
work and we also need to
make sure that we're able to recruit volunteers
to do the work so we're thinking
that way moving forward and everything that
we do how
do we tap into some of this
funding available how do
we make these partnerships
really
really.
Have some momentum if you
will especially on
years with there is money available
now there's always that understanding
that you go through a
lot sometimes and trying to figure
out where some of these budget
dollars are going to trust
me I know I get in front of you
and up to 10 to know
that each district is very
unique also.
But knowing that there's
something there
share that with us
in this paperwork to be
done if there's
applications to be put
together let
us show us how to
do that or let us know that there's something
out there who do we
call that we
we've got a team make us a better you
know that puts together our of
peas.
It's all volunteers.
But they put him together they've
done federal state
we've done in all.
We just need to know how to reach that of
those dollars and try to figure that piece
out capital outlay
I think capital outlay is
changes every year your
process every
single year you guys change your mind
I want to do it it's
not you but it's it's it's
it's a folks I decide make these
decisions it becomes
more and more difficult to
try to get this
information to you in a timely
manner. It
really is
and when you're
trying to reach out to one of you
personally getting the
correct information
to you is of the utmost
urgency.
And we understand that
we also understand that
in our area we're very blessed
because they talk to each
other.
The legislators talk to each other on
what date with with urgent needs
are in our community.
I would suggest that that happen
throughout the state.
I mean I know how other states to
capital outlay existing Google is
very broken in New Mexico
it's broken.
I I think there's something wrong with
it
whenever.
I mean it's a palette here account
makes a decision on what their needs
are. And they
also allow a nonprofit
like ours to be in capital
outlay why is it
not a priority.
On their list.
But it might be a priority on your
list. On
your list as our leaders of
our state it might be a priority
for you but you don't see it
on the city's priorities well
you don't see it on the counties
priorities.
It's there we have a
number what's that
priority and
I think that that those things need to be
prioritized by leaders
I think that makes more sense
because they have a real sense of what's
happening in their
districts
what's going on with
their constituents
I think to me that be the way to do
capital outlay
Washington state's a good
example take a look
at what they're doing they've got a
committee legislators that put
together what's going to
happen and it comes from
other requests come from every
leader I ever miss a palatin
county they prioritize these
things and they get something together
that makes sense for their
budget.
Urgency a basic need needs
to be at the top of what you do there's
a I heard this saying the other
day said
time is of of many of the
poor.
We need to spend our
time.
Really trying to do good for
people.
That's what we do
more.
And I know that's what you try to do
every day so we can do
those things I think we're gonna be in a
good place and we would make some of these
changes.
I'm just kind of backing up a
little bit.
I think you know in terms
of like a general operating
type Fund
I I think
for all my experience that I've had
working with the nonprofit
every single year
we're asked to do more with
less every
single solitary here
that's how it is do
more but you're getting
less money and
I think sometimes the view of
non profits is that we're not
a serious business that we are
just a nonprofit
you know as I mentioned my budgets
$10000000 I employs
60000000 people 60
people of 60000000
costs you much.
Now I feel like I'm done
I'm done
but
but we buy goods and
services we're an economic
driver
and
we are
just you know we're accountable
we're transparent we are
serious business that needs
help but the
reality is is at a lot
of times as Lorenzo had
said is that our
funding is very specific
to the service delivery
which is our mission which is
our top priority
but I can't do that
if I don't have
somebody to make to
pay pay roll I can't
do that if we don't have money
to be able to
run our business
right and and it's not
that I don't have a good
budget I'm just
restricted on how I'm allowed
to use that budget and
for our organization we
spend 89.$0.89
on the dollar goes to
direct services
that's mass that's
that's wonderful for
nonprofit to be able
to do that knowing that 89
percent 89
percent of my funding
goes to direct services
and only 11 percent is for
that general operate
like that general operating piece
of it but thinking
about not just having
the junior bill money
but but thinking about
and I know this is a pie in the sky
ask but having
some kind of set
aside that is general
operating
unrestricted dollars
that doesn't mean unaccountable
that doesn't mean that we're not going to
report that we're not going to
be to top you know how you're
gonna have access to our financial
source services to everything we're
doing but allow us some
flexibility to buy the
infrastructure that we don't have
that we have nonprofits that
don't have the
computers that they need to to
provide services in rural
areas but it's not
just the computer is the
I. T. support
to run that you know we were
not all I. T. I mean
I I know enough to be
dangerous when it comes
I. T. but a lot of little
nonprofits don't
have that type that's
a luxury service
but it would be wonderful to
have a. Nice
big pool
of unrestricted dollars
that we would be allowed to
apply for a you know
R. F. P. potentially even
go through the scoring matrix
but the take that into
consideration when you are
allocating money for
nonprofits we
have to run our
business not
just provide the service and
done if I can just interject here just
because of understanding when
she talks about $0.89 on
the dollar
every nonprofit has to that has
a budget this large has to get
audited and the
audit looks at
how much they spend per
dollar on
services the
baseline is traditionally
80 percent.
So 80 percent of every
dollar goes to programs
which means that there are
typically the ex expectation
is the 20 percent goes to
staff and operations
when you see that there is an
agency that goes above
that you know that they are
prioritizing their
programs.
And their staff
is this is the second
even though that they understand their staff
is really just the bread and butter of
what they do so
you know 89 percent
just my experience
State Valley Community of Hope is that
90 percent Lawrence
I'm not sure of what yours
is.
91 percent and so
I think you see typically on
these nonprofits that are
providing these services
that are so desperately needed
rarely are they at the
the bare minimum
because they are they are going
above and beyond in terms of
spending money in allocating
their money and because
of that they're having to be very
strategic about where that money
goes and
what they spend it on so if
I I just wanted to add that because
sometimes we have a tendency
of just using
in jargon
that were used to and so
I I try to be the the
jargon interpreter for
for you and
vice chair of the
said one more thing if you want
to talk about the expense
of the
expense of an
audit because as a
nonprofit those are things that we
don't get to take right off
usually in in
our funding and so
please please let the committee
know about that.
I'm you know I think a big part
of of our
nonprofit work in
the audit you know we're looking
at even a small not for
profit probably
you know anywhere from 15000
up to 30000 just
for an audit and we
were just talking about
are both funding and receiving
arpa funding when you
receive any type of federal funds
you have to do a single audit so
not only are we doing a normal
audit at about
15 to 25000
now we have to do a single audits
and I know what my colleagues
here I'm already do
single audits but that's a little really
large the
large expands and we
are the fiscal home for
a small not for profit and
we incubate some nonprofits
and kind of teach them the
ins and outs and you know how
to get set up in the state
and they were going to roll out
at the end of this year
and I was talking to them a little
bit about their budget
moving forward
what is that gonna look like
they have an amazing donor that
may give a very significant
given to them in a civil
the minute that donor gives that
significant gaps in your on
your own you have
to have a full audit and they're like oh
that's fine it's like you know 7
or $8000 nice to know
you're looking at probably
15 at the low
as but a lot of us
you know we do our of peas we support
our local businesses as well
but the audit piece can be
I'm pretty significant
I think all of us on our panel
and we very much believe
in employing are
individuals locally
and paying them what they're worth
and we try really really
hard to make sure that
all of our employees make
more than minimum wage that
we're coming health vision
dental other
types of insurances
my team got very upset with
me last year my board actually
got upset with me because
they refuse to have a
raise on my salary
because I really needed a fourth
person I really
needed somebody else on our team
just to get the work done and
I said I will forego
a raise I don't need that I
need a fourth person
and it was tough because we had to
then go out to our public in
state we are growing. As a
team this is why our budget
is is rising
and I think a lot of not for profits feel
that way if I only had another
person I only had 10
more volunteers and we
can do that work and we're
always trying to look
at how much of our money
per dollar is going to
services
because I will tell you our donors
now I'm expressly
our baby boomer donors
intergenic stoners
they actually come in with the
990 they've
printed off and they've
highlighted and they want
to say where's this
money and how much are you are
you using for
administration
I've been in this industry for 20
over 20 years and this
is the first time I've had donors
come to me and say where's
this money coming from but I
also have donors I understand
that we pay wealth that
we employed people and that we are
an economic driver so it's
really important for
us.
I always had the fear of
you know going over 10 percent
M. administrative costs
because I met terra
12 years ago when I started this
work and she said you had to be
under 10 percent and so
that's the right with that's a right way to
do business and I always
remember that and and
and it's something that I strive for every
year organization we
set our budget we
make sure that we try to do
that our goal is always 7
percent doesn't always
happen. Doesn't
always happen we try
the we've gone over the 10 percent
once in 1000
get fired
yeah I I was just freaked out
because I had never happened to me
before thank tell you
one thing that cost is
big but you know for us
we needed we needed as a tool
it also helps us because
some grant tors in
foundations will not take a
grant if you do not have or
not.
You know our partner to city of
those cruises at Dona
Ana County they require us
to have an audit.
You know it.
They need those
tools as well from
us so that
we can try to go after CDBG
funding and some of these other things
that day really strive to
help us with to try to get some of this
stuff down and tell you
right now that those partnerships as
government had been so robust for
because I've been in the nose.
And so.
Perfectly then
as if you will by people
within government and
with us that
we're able to rely on them on
things on on things
that we just did not expect to get
out from. You
know especially during the
pandemic they really came through for
us we were able to take care of a lot of
people
that way
especially when we lost 100
percent of our volunteers and you're
right trying to get people back in is the
difficult part
but M. speaking of return
on investment real quick to
do share some numbers with you
on the first 2
quarters of this year
annually
the value of the food
that we distributed
is up in the ram of
about
3.$6000000.
We brought in in
requests
and private
contributions about
44.84.9
we funded 190000000
I mean 0
and
volunteer hours himself
valued at about 230
5000 a
year.
If we include the brand new
property that
we're on now with a brand new
building and we
were leasing this on a commercial
lease you know
it would be up about
235000 here
that that that would cost
us
it's it's amazing we
able to do we have the right
partnerships and
I wanna give could us my friend
Natalie here who
helps us so much at
the city level with so many
things that that
we would not be able to get through we
can have those those really
good relationships again with the
city that's the thing we're
trying to do with you in these
panels these
opportunities give us that you
know gives us that opportunity
to really do some special with
you our state
leaders.
So I think we'll call for
questions okay
time I was going to ask if you're
ready for that because I
already have a
list of
of the committee members who want to
ask questions
a couple of things I I do want to point
out that while we
were talking about those
connections between
our local nonprofits and understanding
the capital outlay process
just last month
in working with the city of Los
crucis Representative Rubio on
myself presented a capital
outlay workshop on teaching
nonprofits
about the relationships that they
need to have with their fiscal Sanchez
what the whole process is
like because there
still are so many and we understand
that since we're going to have a
surplus we want to make
sure that they all are aware
of that so if you are
interested in doing that and
in doing that in your communities
let me know I'll be more than happy to
provide you with kind of the structure
that we used
here but it's really
trying to connect those nonprofits
with the just the
process because as we
know from those of us on the
on the other side we
know how chaotic it is as soon as
that bill drops and we have to make those
capital outlay decisions
and so we
can't even begin to imagine from a
nonprofit that doesn't know about that
process of who's trying to
learn and also is
much is I know that
we get frustrated with
junior money I do want
to stress
how for many
nonprofits that
junior money that is not tied
infrastructure is sometimes
a make or break up a program
and so we recognize that
there there are challenges
with that
because it's really not an
effective way for nonprofits
for communities to run or
plan their budgets
it's the system we have right now
when we have people who are very committed
to trying to figure out better
ways but it
is what we're working with right
now we do
have Representative
Martinez
and then Senator Diamond
Brantley Representative
Garrett Representative Roybal
coming out and then Senator
Steinborn ready
to ask questions so Representative
Martinez. Your
first.
Thank you madam chair
and.
Panel.
A lot of
information
and I and I need your help
in. Kind
of explaining to me
something
on this.
Presentation.
You showed
$35000000
in assets and
then I guess it was
broken down to
endowments
assets pledges planned
giving fixed assets
is that is that correct
yeah okay.
Yes so $38000000
in assets
and you awarded
2.$6000000.
But then you said that
89
percent.
Was given
to direct service can you
explain I'm
having a hard time digesting
that affirmation yeah
so I think there's 2 pieces
to that Representative
Martinez one
is community action agency
is a separate organization
so their budget they're doing
$0.89 per
dollar is going out to direct
services and the
community foundation of Southern New
Mexico
community foundations are really
based in and down my
structure we are
built for long term
sustainability so
our dollars are fully
invested into multiple
investments for a long
term and so we work
with a lot of non for profits
and all use custody Peregrinos
for example I'm that
we are in Dowling dollars
for a long term and then
day announcements on the
earning is what we are
sending out to the community
so the 2.6000000
is the earnings on our
endowment and so we
support about 47
nonprofit sustainability
funds casa de
Peregrinos is grown there is
from 60000
to almost 300000
in the last 2 years
because we knew that there is going to be a
maintenance me on a
building
what if not I would
what is an air conditioner goes down
what if there's a water leak if they
can pull from those earnings
and then manage those dollars
outside of their operations
I'm so it is hard is
it to stay in state I about
$38000000 in assets
that I'm holding but is for
long term sustainability
also we are focused
on donors I'm in their
funds so if you
gave a funded said I want
to support Sandoval
County nonprofits
and I'm gonna give
$100000
I'm gonna invest that $0
and that earnings would go out to non
for profits each
year I'm so we're really
focused more on kind of
building philanthropy
I'm so I don't have programmatic
programs as much like community
action agency and
Costa
Peregrinos.
Thank you for that I I.
Understand a little bit
better.
But there's talk about junior
money going for operations
of a non profit in 4
years
I tried to figure out how to
get my veterans
nonprofits
to be able to do that and I was always
told it was against the law did
the law change
as is it not allowed to
do that.
Representative there are
up fiscal
connections between
a mother and their connections
between physical properties of fiscal
agents and these
nonprofit so for example
there are a couple of programs
that I've given junior money too
so
don who what was the department
again that we
had money go to I
HSD HSD
to contract
for the
young entrepreneurship
program that they are now
expanding into multiple counties
so that money went to them
so the HSD
to then go ahead and put a
contract with those
organizations and that
is how that does not violate
the anti donation
clause thank you
madam chair because this
year there was
a couple of legislators and
again junior money
to.
One of the counties
to fund.
Appropriations for better
nonprofit we were told
absolutely no
you have to change that so
went to a capital
project instead
so I'm kind of confused
why that
happened and I might
need to pull those strings a little
bit more right maybe
because we were freshmen we
didn't know what we're doing well some of
it is the language that you have to be very
careful with
because
there's also one that I
work with with the
city of Los crucis
for programs that serve the
in house and
so those have
to be I know Natalie couldn't
maybe address that when she comes to speak
but there's a little bit of the
language difference and I'm more than happy
to help you find that but usually
the fiscal agent can
provide you with the language that is
appropriate but also
work with
your finance person in the
house to make sure
that that language is correct in that
it's not violating anything
go ahead.
Madam chair
of definitely gonna
come talk to you yeah vice chair
of guys would like to add to that too
so Representative I've been on
the capital
outlay negotiation
team for the house hi for the
last 6 years and
what I have found to is it
also has made a difference
with the
administration
different governors have
different
that the also in
with their DFA
secretaries.
What the what categories
Fund and so I
we've seen a shift
within the last with
this new administration as well
so that maybe were some
of the the conflict is
and so when we talk about we
don't know with the the
guidelines are it's because
it's a moving target and
and I've seen that and so that's
what makes it hard not only for
our non profits but it makes it
hard for those of us who are
trying to find our
nonprofits.
Thank you madam chair vice
chair under the previous
2 administrations we were
not allowed to do that
I know
that.
Force the 17
years that I was policy director
of. Every
year the veteran
nonprofits would tell
me. Can
we figure out a way to do
this.
And unfortunately I had
several
American legions
and and
VFW have to close up
appropriations
because and not
nobody there was taking a
salary that's what bothers
me this was money
for
their building to upkeep
to bring it up to code
whatever I
had but
probably a dozen
of my American
legions of VFW is that
had to close their buildings
sell whatever few
assets they had on
hand.
Because we
were never allowed to do
that and
those were.
Non profits and local
communities or helping
veterans
who didn't have for
helping them find shelter
help doing all the
things that these nonprofits
are doing.
Very targeted
thing.
To help veterans
and we were never allowed
to do that and I have to stand
by and
and watch them sell
off an air conditioner
stole.
Whatever assets they had
and shut down their building
and those those
small communities have
nothing now.
And Representative I think
you really kind of
nailed just
what most
nonprofits have to address
and wrestle with on
a regular basis is like
how are we going to
be financially sustainable
and we all know that
is much is it's nice to
be able to to you
know allocate a certain amount of
money we also know
that those nonprofits would be
severely affected if we couldn't do
that so what how do we fix
that system and I think that's the
conversation
that we can have
it's not the conversation that we're having
here but
I think that's those are
issues that we have to you know
that all of us are wrestling
with. It's a
really fine point that you're making
I absolutely agree because
if we weren't laying people
off there was no
salaries that stopped
flowing into the community
it was direct services
veterans or no longer being
taken care of.
Right now there's
a move to fund
operations were their
salaries are being
paid and then
don't set up
I'm talking about veterans
of lost services
and we lost veterans
because of it.
And we were always told no
and now.
Let's change the way we do
things and start
paying appropriations what
can we do with them when veterans
lives are on the line.
Thank you madam chair that's my editorial
comment for the day all
righty we got
it now we're we're we've
got you even if you've met your
day thank you very
much Representative Senator Diamond
Brantley thank you
madam chair make sure
your friends are also my friends
I should say that Terry and
I attended Los crucis high
school together when she was chairman
I can I was Crystal 0
and she has been a
superstar I would
talk about how many New
Mexicans leave New
Mexico right and
she is an example someone we've grown
our own leadership here she did really
good work here in New Mexico state
terror that's awesome to see
you transition to this
and do real meaningful work and
how this is this is near and dear
to our hearts I thank you all for being
here I think
that what I will say is I
represent a rural area
and the value of non profits
in rural New Mexico cannot be
understated because the reality
is is you were doing the work the
government simply isn't
doing but before
we started we had a conversation
terra or or Lorenzo
you would know how daga
county your home county
is very dependent on
the work that nonprofits
do and when
we talk about how
how we can best help
the investing our nonprofits
is important I think of our
animal shelters and our child
welfare services and Sierra
County former
representative Rebecca Dow is
started for 56
nonprofits that have
have arguably changed
lives in Sierra County
because those resources would not
be available
had we had we not invested
those nonprofits there
but but I also want to address
some of like the elephants in the
room as we we as
we have a discussion about how we
better funded nonprofits
a lot of that discussion is going to
center around accountability
because and with just
like everything there's gonna be some bad
apples and you're gonna have a
lot of pushback of
examples of nonprofit
that abuse simply
abused
their position they were
accountable for the money and so as
you continue these discussions are
going to have to address that
is as well I will say that
we talk about putting
89 per. Center
9191 percent
of the dollar back and services
that's certainly a lot better than governments
doing you know I could I
could I could use public schools
and examples of how
that that gap is
widening and more spent on
administration and less in the
classroom and so I
applaud you guys for doing that
because that's real
will you know
meaningful change is actually
impacting citizens lives
there how
frustrating it is for you guys to
build these budgets off junior money
and I imagine that last
year when the governor
vetoed junior
money we had
nonprofits across the
state and in a
panic because
with the swipe of a pen she
actually do
funded all of
the good work that nonprofits
we're doing here in New
Mexico and so
I I think the value of those
nonprofits was recognized by
the legislator who we convene
and and restored a lot
of that money back into
place and rightfully so I
apologize for that scared
scared us all as legislators to
wouldn't when she abruptly did
that
right so you kind of touched
on the frustration
of
access.
so anyway I just wanted you to
be aware of that.
And that that's that's really all I have
I I know for all the
critiques Madam
chair of our capital outlay
system.
I actually like our system
in that it
does allow us individually
to be able to make
decisions that go beyond
what we're told maybe that you were
talking the runs about how
it may not be a city priority
but of course I may represent multiple
cities or unincorporated
areas and nonprofit
so allows us a
level of kind of
entrepreneurial
placement of funds that
we feel can help
us meet our districts
and so it's
there are those that want to change that
system and so we're going to find all these
resources into
some super committee
that that makes those decisions
and I really worry that
a lot of important
things that may not make
a list like that would fall through the
cracks it certainly could
be some nonprofit stuff too
so.
Because the flip side of the coin of capital
outlay reform but
I swam by thanking you all for the
work that you do and I
know that you all
personally and and just
doing amazing work here in our
community so I
appreciate it thank you thank
you thank you senator Senator
representative Allison and then
representative
Duncan.
Thank you madam chair

presentation.

I appreciate hello
your presentation dealt
with
supporting
nonprofits
I have an entity
that has filed for
nonprofit status
and this entity
has been trying to get their
project off the ground
for the past 20
years the
entity is the
Navajo code talker
museum.
I feel
that this is something
that has become
a pet project for
me that I want
to see come to
fruition in my
short political
career
of they have been
working on this Navajo code
talker museum like I
said for the past 20
years and it
seems that they
have just been spinning their
wheels of
for the past 20 years
and until most
recently of
we started raising funds
and we filed
as 501 see
3 and
finally getting some
recognition.
The reason why
I support this
entity is
because there are
only.
3 surviving
Navajo code talkers at
this time.
When I joined the legislature
in 2019
there was 4 of
surviving
and over the past
summer we lost the
fourth 1 when he
was 98 years
old.
As I said there are 3
remaining code
talkers.
The oldest one
celebrated
his birthday this past
summer he turned
106.
The youngest that I
am diligently working
with is
94 and
he will be 95
in a couple months
so I would really
really appreciate
any help any
assistance that I can
get to bring this
Navajo code talker
museum to
fruition
I wish to see
at least the foundation
started and walls
going up.
For the
9695 year
old will be able to
say Hey I
was part of begin
this project
so I would appreciate
any assistance
of that you could give
me
I like I said I
appreciate your support
for the non profits
in your area I
do not know of
any organization and
northwest New
Mexico
that supports
the nonprofit's as you
do maybe my
of colleague
representative Duncan does
but I have not heard of any
organization supporting
nonprofits in our area
so my plea
for assistance extends
to my fellow colleagues in the
legislature as well
so any help you can give
us we're
all. All
years and will
embrace it with open arms
thank you and in my
language I should
have thank
you.
Thank you madam chair
thank you Representative and
I I I I
will not speak for the entire committee
but you have whatever commitment
we you need from us
I'm more than happy to because
it's just recognizing just
part of our
industry and
recognizing such an
incredible impact and
contribution
from these individuals that we're
losing unfortunately
thank you madam chair yes
I don't know if if terror
if you want to address
that question yes I'm
sharing committee members and
representative Allison
I will definitely follow up with
you and you have some amazing
non for profit leaders there
in San Juan County
we've been developing a
nonprofit capacity
building training
an on demand course
with New Mexico State
University
to assist a lot
of our nonprofit leaders
in San Juan
to get kind of the bases
and and how to run a board
how to run an offer profit will share
that with you you
have some excellent nonprofit
leaders I'm here some great
contacts at Fort Lewis
in Durango and we can
definitely make some connections
and there's some other groups
that are just starting in that area
that would connect
very very well with the
code talkers museum so
we'll definitely make those connections
for you.
Thank you this winter thank you
madam chair.
Thank you Representative and I think you
know what we find
especially given the
grants
are becoming fewer and far between
is that a lot of nonprofits are
collaborating and that's
where this federal money's
really will start to kick in
is when there's a collaboration
there so I think that's really
just kind of the beginning
of what happens
but I would I would hope that
and I know that you're conveying
this that there is a sense of
urgency for
this and so
I really appreciate any
anything you know and
connecting you with any of these fine
folks I'm more than happy
to do but I think Miss which
we'll go ahead and if you've
got your business card share with
you that be great as
well and so
thank you very much representative
Duncan you're you're the last of our
questions today.
Thank you madam terminal make
this quick
can you tell
me.
At some point in the government
did some of the things you're doing
perhaps not all of them but can you tell me
at what percentage is
that you the government
no longer has to
report that were
for example if there were 41
people on
of this type
of service there's only
36 now as a result
do you have that
information.
Happened about.
The second by the people with that we serve
actually.
My question and it may be
a far reaching question and and
so just tell me if it is
I was wondering at some
point in the government served
some of these groups that
you're serving they are no
longer having to that because you're doing
it you know what that percentage
is.
I think that's what
yeah.
Yeah I don't know any of us
would have I'm
that data I think it would be something
that would be really interesting
I was just talking with
groundworks New Mexico about
the economic
developments and report
that you all have an updating
it it would be interesting
if we could do a little bit
of data
so we were just talking
about senior services and
Sierra County so
what used to maybe come
from the state
for come from you know
federal veterans
programs were no
longer being served and now
not for profits are kind of
having that service area
I'm wondering if there's some data
questions that we can ask
in this next status that
to see what those likelihoods
are
what we're seeing definitely I think
and senior services would be
kind of close what you're talking
about you know the city of Los crucis
has senior services
to the of meals on wheels
and they have community
centers they have
centers out in the counties
but what they're doing is they're
supplementing those centers
with organizations like
this so maybe
that they are unlocking the
doors and turn the air conditioners
on but it's because they're
getting cost of the purpose to
deliver food or
don's team is going out to
sign them up for Medicaid
Medicare and other services
so be really interesting I think there
is more of a
partnership
but with those are data questions that
maybe we can add to
this thank you madam
chair that's all I have.
Thank you so much and thank you panel
for such an in
incredible
conversation and and
support of our nonprofits and
I'm really grateful and and
really not surprised on how many of
you support our nonprofits and
and understand kind
of the needs that that
just is just an example of
of Southern New Mexico
but as we've heard from conversations
that we're experiencing this all over the
state representative Armstrong
like to go ahead and just really quick
because you brought up catching County
madam chair you
know I was there last weekend
and there was a petition going around
to try to stop family dollar from
coming in shutting
down the local grocery store
and so we have to be very
careful
about
nonprofits
businesses in the community and
how they interact
and so I just needed to make
that statement because a rural New
Mexico I don't have
a grocery store in Magdalena
except for $1 store
and $1
general thank you
madam chair.
We know that there
is the the healthy food financing
initiative that Senator Diamond
and I continue to
support that would provide
opportunities for
grocery stores in rural communities
that are experiencing food
apartheid
so I I think those are those
are we still and
so what we're doing what we're doing because we
see that our communities have
needs so thank
you very much for that thank
you Lorenzo Tara and
dawn for for being here
today I appreciate
you so much you know that already
so we appreciate
you being here and tear if you don't mind giving
your card to representative Allison because
I think we all agree that.
What he needs to get done
this very urgent
so thank you thank you
so much we have one more panel
today.
That we are talking about is
the economics of affordable
housing.
And that
features Natalie Greene
from who is the housing and neighborhood
services a person from the
city of Los crucis thank
you very much New Mexico
Martinez is executive director
of the C. Valley Community of
Hope out of full
transparency I was the
board president for the Missy Valley
Community of Hope for 4
years worked
closely with miss
Martinez
and understand
ultimately we are talking about
a housing shortage throughout the
state and
you know we have Missy
Valley Community of Hope which is
recognized nationally
for the concept
is a campus I hope I'm not stealing
your thunder nickel
it is a campus to provide
services to the in house
they're all located in 11
area off of a major
artery and it
provides a lot of
resources but
as we know because of
the pandemic are
people losing jobs
rents going up we know that
there are more people
experiencing homelessness
then we have I think in
a very long time and
so but we also have to recognize
that there are
certainly things that
we could be doing as
a legislature
to help that
situation because we know that there's
a trickle down effect we know that
when we have people who are on house to
don't have homes they're not able to
work they're not able to bring money back
into our communities
we are seeing that all over
the place not over it not only just
in New Mexico but all over the
country so
I appreciate the call and Natalie
you being here today
and of I'm
gonna go ahead and turn it over to you and
let you go ahead and do your
magic.
Thank you Senator Hamblen
members of the committee thank you for
inviting us here today
we're gonna talk about.
Our population of people
experiencing homelessness and
and the entire continuum
of of housing people
in our community
and I just want
to you know start off by
giving you a little bit of background on the
Community of Hope started
in the nineties at
the time it was a day shelter and
had a few rooms for
families and
over the years we realize that well
that was really important to
continue to serve people
who are were surviving day
to day that we needed to expand
our services to be more
comprehensive and wraparound
so we sit on the campus of the Community
of Hope it's owned by the
city of Los crucis they lease
with us and then we
sublet to some of our other
partners on that
campus one you
just heard from Lorenzo all of us
because of the bitterness sits on that
campus as well as
the something the Los Ninos
I'll call the the soup kitchen
and Amador health centers we
have all kinds of wraparound
services right within a stone's
throw.
So I'll take a little
bit about the services that we've seen
and that they have been
increasing over the years
we think a few things are
happening one
we're getting much better at data
when we started when I
started at community of hope 17
years ago there were
about 8 or 9 of us
and as of today we
have 38 staffs of a
pretty good a data team
that's helping us to collect information
also during COVID we
served people like we
had never served before
and again just increasing some of the
gaps in services that we had
for example of the money
model day labor program
in our outreach team that
is really flexible can go out
to the community and
help anybody who's
addressing homelessness out on the
streets so the
numbers that we have
2 fiscal years ago
were about 3000 and
some and this last fiscal
year we are over 7000
people that we had served
so you can tell that our our
numbers have gone up
and we serve a variety of people
we we serve adults
primarily but we do serve
families as
well we serve
veterans and have special
programs for our
veterans
in fact last year we served
449
veterans and we
housed 972
people including
138
children.
So I wanted to talk quickly
about some of the purpose of the side
still having the day shelter people can
come in and get ideas for certificates
all the things that they need when they're applying
for housing with the
landlord they can take
showers they can
do laundry it can trying to meet
basic needs but it's also really
important for us to
establish rapport with those that we
are serving some
people wanted housing
and help yesterday and and
some are on the
phone chart trajectory it
might take some time to
work with them on on transitioning
from homelessness to housing.
In 2011 we
realize that we were
missing
the continuing piece of
sheltering people
so while we were open day
to day meeting the
needs of people recited to have
an overnight
encampment that was
sanctioned by the city of Los crucis
in 2011 continues
to operate today we have
up to 50 people sleeping
in our backyard close to
services close to
bathrooms close
to signing up for
housing
and it's it's really assisted
with our continue and being
effective in helping people
obtain income helping them up
apply for housing in the
past you were driving along
the Rio and going out to the organs
to try to find when it's called a
client's turned for social security
appointment or housing appointment
so it's it's helped our
clients immensely to provide
that sheltering that
does not come with any
funding from the
federal government or the state of the
city except for
the land that we do
have
but we do have an
annual fundraiser to keep Campos
because we recognize it's
important having been having
safe outdoor
spaces.
We also
have several different types of
propane programs that's really
when I came on to the committee of hope in
2005
we just started our first had
grant and from there
we have just grown a lot of the
requests we
are pretty heavily
had funded so we
do have rapid re housing
programs we have
permanent supportive housing
programs that assist people
who are chronically homeless and have a permanent
disability
we also have homeless prevention
so people who are about
to become homeless or be evicted
from their units we can assist
them thank you senator
Hammond we have some junior bill funding
to assist people especially with the
homeless prevention funding
because that has
been
rare until
COVID helping people stay
in their homes and so this this grant
is helping us not only transition people
but keep them in their homes as
well.
We own properties so we
realize that there was a
lack of affordable housing
in our community
and we realize that we
really we needed to
go outside the box which we did
for Campos but we also needed to
do that for housing
so we purchased several
homes we also manage
a couple apartment complex we
have a partnership with the Misia valley
public Housing Authority we manage
a 22 unit complex that's
just for veterans were experiencing
homelessness have an on site
service provider there
we also have 2 homes
that house a gentleman
with permanent disabilities
and most recently
we in partnership with
the city of Los crucis and Missy
valley public Housing Authority developed
40 units apartments part of
housing an apartment
complex here in Los
crucis the city of
Los crucis also purchased some
property on the
northwest corner of the Misia valley
community of hope campus we're looking
at providing more
units for
housing to help fill that
gap
in our community and again learning how
to do above and
beyond and and and
stretch our development arm
in terms of our response
to
homelessness.
I do want to
just sort of highlight little bit some
of the cost savings
thinking or talking about how nonprofits
are are you know bring a
lot of staff
and like I said we now have
38 so
supporting a lot of
people
but we also you
know I have to look
at things like what
our our cost measurements might
be and how else are we contributing
to the economy
and we definitely
believe that by housing people
you know we're helping to stimulate the
economy especially if they
are allowed to be on a
a subsidy whether it's short
term or or long
term clients are
required to pay 30 percent
of their income toward the rent which is
really the gist
of having affordable
housing
and so just some some basic
figures we go by
fair market rent so if we look at the
fair market rent for a 2
bedroom unit which
includes utilities that number is
893 sets a
standard that set for
our community
and we house 150
households
so for one month of rent that
$759050
in that month it just went back into our
community and hopefully
that resident was able to
go and spend money in our
community as
well if we're
looking at one year of that subsidy
over $9000000
put back into our community
through housing
I really want to touch on a a new
program that we started a couple of
years ago we did
receive some private grant funding
to initiate a
landlord risk mitigation
program where we
can really try to incentivize
our landlords to partner with
us to accept a voucher
so we can incentivize
by bringing landlords on we
can pay above
and beyond damages if
we need to in that unit and
often times if that happens then
there's the commitment from the landlord
that either they will keep the
tenant in that
space for they
will allow
us to put in another
client
in that unit so
that's been really helpful
for us.
A variety of things we can do with that and
then have extended
that program through the city
are but funding so we will
hang on to that for as long as the funds are
available or the next 3 years
whichever comes first
but we hope that that becomes a
sustainable program
for the community and we're discussing
housing
issues.
I'm gonna turn it over to
Natalie at first I I really
want to say you know a couple of things
be remiss if I don't say thank you
so much for the support that we've had
during a
session you know capital
outlay
opportunities The
Cosby Peregrinos moved out to their
new building which means a committee of
hopefuls expand into their vacant
space which is you can
imagine 9
staff grown to 38
and 1 bathroom
could really use that expansion
so we have obtained of funding
a lot of support from our
legislators as
well as supporting the linkages
program which
is a partnership with the HSD
and the New Mexico mortgage finance
authority in directing an administrator of
that program we have
63 vouchers
going out into our community
I I will say probably see
me during the next
session we can talk about
expanding the weakened linkages
program and
also possibly
project basing those
vouchers so that we can
look at have more opportunities
for development properties
as well as something that we sort of
are told to not really talk about
but I'm going to talk about it
I really think that we should be
funding services
and flexible services
so you heard me talk about our had funding
but it's very
restrictive it's only
for certain people and
if we had opportunities
to go out and
and find amazing case
management outreach
at our discretion for the
increasing numbers of on house
folks then I think that we could really
start to make a huge impact
in our communities right
now our hands are a little tight
so that's my that's my
dream that's my big
ask but I think that we should be
asking to have those services
funding and and not
just for committee of vote no many of our
nonprofit partners could really
benefit from having
flexible service funding
thank
you.
Thank you madam chair Natalie
Greene thank you for allowing
me to speak today representatives and
senators I work
for the city of Los crucis
my team is the housing and neighborhood
services team and our
purpose is to
advance a community and Human
Services delivery system so
we work a lot on
housing food insecurity
poverty health and
economic well being
more specifically for those
underserved population
so I have such
appreciation for Nicole
and the other nonprofits and other
community members for which we
work with
one of the things I like
to do is ground everyone and
what affordable housing is
because there's lots of definitions
and everyone likes to throw around
affordable subsidized
attainable workforce
but really affordable housing
is for everyone
regardless of your income it
basically means that no one is
spending more than 30 percent
of their.
Gross wages on their rent
and utilities and
a lot of the work I do around
housing or the city does around
housing.
Is is to address
the social systemic issues
that New Mexico is facing so
when we want to talk about
food insecurity interject
generational poverty economic
mobility childhood
poverty it all leads
back to safe and stable
housing.
At least 50 percent of our
social determinants of health
are based on our zip
code.
Slide number 12 has
the why the 30
percent
and a
lot of that comes to
if we can keep people at their
30 percent of housing
a lot of their other income
is able to go to those other
things so they
have funding to be able
to have
a excellent child care
to afford groceries
to for health insurance
to pay taxes to
to spend in our
communities.
New Mexico
is.
At.
In New Mexico.
It takes about a
$19 of
wages to afford a modest
2 bedroom apartment so that's
about 60 6:00 hours per
week in Los crucis
that number is about $17
per hour and about
55 or 50
hours so
that the city has worked really
hard
to look at that housing to
continue on and to be able
to have programming across
each
stage and as
we look to the state we're looking
to provide funding
sources for each of
those sort of stations
within that housing containing
on from both homelessness
to to market home
ownership and so
each of those programs
is funded differently they have
different
populations
and one way to visualize that
is on slide 15
when we're thinking about
who affordable
housing really is for
its retirees
on social security
income it
could be our
teachers electricians
are firefighters and police
officers so it's
not
it's not just for those people
but it really is for all of
us and so I like that
chart sort of visualize who
were talking about when it comes
to the economics of affordable
housing.
The state and local
governments and counties have
excellent tools
within their toolbox they have
the ability to provide both
incentives
partnership opportunities
development regulations
and funding funding is
always an exciting
11 of the
ways the state
has.
Has the ability to partner
is many
federal programs or local
programs will cover the
actual development of
housing but what it doesn't cover
is the capital infrastructure
and improvements to be
able to open up those housing
opportunities so
things like roads
and last mile
extensions for
utilities and broadband
and sidewalks are really
important to the overall
housing toolbox
and affordable housing
even though I'm speaking for the city
of Los crucis it's really in need
across the state so as you go
into the session think about
funding affordable housing programs
in New York in your
communities because new units
in
and Socorro
County or or Bernalillo
county or or the other
counties that you Representative are
really units for for New
Mexico so
I would advocate for housing
statewide.
I just want to show on
page 17 that there
is a risk return
on investment when we invest in
affordable housing so
the city
has developed a pipeline
of housing projects that are coming
down the pipeline many of them
have at least
4 to one investment if not
10 to one investment
so over the next couple
years the city wants
to invest
just about
$29000000
and will have almost a
$200000000 return
on investment and that's
going to
bring in at least 900
units to the city of Los
crucis and so I heard
one of the representatives talk
about a long term
capital investment
housing is
infrastructure investment
it's many of the units
that we build will stay affordable
for well over 40 years
and and it's really an
investment in the long
term.
Viability of New
Mexico I just
have some slides on projects which
I won't go with but
based on the last conversation
in this conversation
I also wanted to note
that you as legislators
have already set
precedent for partnerships with
both cities and
nonprofits
in the state statute it's
a chapter
43813.2.
Legislative findings
of the legislature finds that
without the daily contributions
and efforts of the thousands of
worthwhile nonprofit
organizations dedicated
to serving the sick and indigent
persons in communities throughout
New Mexico the state would be
in in any dated with
constant requests for health and
human and social services
that it does not have the revenue
or resources to provide
and so the legislature finds that
it's in the best interest of that
population as well for all
residents and taxpayers
that consideration be extended
as real value recognition
to the indispensable part of the
services
and their contribution to the
fabric of life in New
Mexico and
so I know the
conversation talked a lot
about the anti
donation
I just wanna thank you
guys and thank the nonprofits
for all their work
and any time I've had
an issue with junior bill dollars
I can always point this to the
statue and say you know
the legislators told us that
that this funding matters
those nonprofits matter that are
partnerships with
affordable housing matter so
and I've sent that
statute to Erin
she will send that to all of
you.
So are you are you ready for
questions
okay thank
you so much and I and and
before the
week we go to are
representative Armstrong Senator
Steinborn.
I don't know if there's anybody
else.
We do have a tour of a cannabis
farm after that so after this
so that may be the.
The enthusiasm that some
people are experiencing right
now one thing
I want to I want to point out is
that there
is there is a a model
that is being used is called housing
first and
ultimately it's to get people
into housing because you and
I all of us who are
who are fortunate
enough to have a roof over our
head we can drink all we
want we can run around **** naked
all we want we can do whatever we want
our houses and we will not get arrested
for it.
The idea of housing first
is to make sure that people have
homes so that they
are experiencing
mental health issues that they are
experiencing addiction issues if
they are experiencing
physical ability issues that
they have a case manager that
addresses those issues well
they still are in a home
and so we we have to
recognize that the housing first model
and you can correct me to call if I'm
I'm wrong I I hope I'm
still. The
correct on that okay
is that if we get folks in houses
first then we can address
the other issues we
see this trickle down
in our communities in Los
crucis were seen this with
businesses the ideas
that we can get people in
homes that are businesses
won't be impacted as much
that our communities will be impacted
as much that we will be able to provide
the resources that agencies like
the Community of Hope
agencies like the community
action agency up
because of the pedigree knows Harding the
listening test and I strongly
encourage that if you want
to see the Community of Hope
campus it is
something that is recognized nationally
because it does include
all of the services in one
area.
Because we know that folks who
are on house
may have transportation
issues so this is off of a major
artery so that they can get public
transportation but
we have a health center on
campus we have a day care
center for kids who are
experiencing homelessness
there is the food of food pantry
because of the pandemic greenhouse
there is the soup
kitchen I'll call the the soup
kitchen and then there's
the C. Valley Community of Hope so there
really addressing all of these
encompassing all of these
issues in one
area but I have to tell
you is that it will not
be would not be a success and that you
get your city government involved
in this because the reason why
this is a success is because our
city government has
recognized that they
cannot do the services that
all of the agencies on the C. Valley
Community of Hope campus can
do so what
they are doing is as of that
partnership and I and I
referred and I've also made
this recommendation to
the executive branch is that you
need to Natalie and you needed to
call in every community
if not we need to clone them
because the relationships that
these 2 have fostered
and understanding where
to maximize what we
find them as legislators
but also what they are able to get
at both the state and federal
level is
really made a difference and maybe
less crucis an example
about a community that helps people
who are experiencing homelessness
and I don't know but you
probably can say the percentage better
than I can but most
of the people that you serve our people who have
lived here.
The national statistics
are something like 75 percent
of people who become homeless become
homeless in the community in which they
live. Thank
you and so I'm gonna go ahead and open
it up to representative Armstrong and
then Senator Steinborn and I don't know
if there's anybody else would like to ask a question
if you can just
so Senator Representative
Armstrong your first thank
you madam chair and thank you for your
presentation I am
I have a
of place in
in Sapporo the
Camino rail
housing that
supposed to be going up
unfortunately there $2000000
short.
It's all been approved
the city's been involved the
counties been involved
but there $2000000 short
to be able to build this and this is
exactly
what
Senator Hamblen was talking
about. All
the resources are right
there. And we
can't get it built.
The last year everything's
gone up at least 20 percent
if not more and
so we've
asked the governor for
help to no
avail unfortunately
I'm hoping that she
hears this someone could
take that back to her
we need that money
we need those resources in
our community
of the drug problem is
completely out of
control
the homeless and
it's right by the high school
it's so that and the
hospital.
So kids that are involved
in that kind of situation with their
family can walk to
school. People
that need other services
emergency services the hospitals
right there but we can't
get it built so
I we're trying we're
trying and I don't have $2000000
to give them.
Not in junior money not in capital
outlay so that's
one problem the
other problem is is when
legislation gets
introduced for rent
control. Or
giving the
I'll. Person
renting
more.
Our then the
landlord.
8 people don't wanna
do hud housing they don't
want to do any kind of housing
where the rent is going to be
controlled by
anybody that legislation
didn't pass but it scares
people it scares
people to open that up
and so I
just.
Not that it's not needed but there
surely there's a nonprofit that can
help people that have bad
actor landlords.
You know we just hold the bad
actors accountable I
want accountability for the bad
actors in
anything.
But when we introduce that
kind of stuff it scares
people off from
opening those kinds of facilities are
offering their
their units into
that kind of
management so I
just needed to say that
so thank you very
much.
I don't know if you want to if you have a
response if not that's okay but
you're welcome to.
Thank you Senator Hamblen
Representative Armstrong I appreciate your
comments on the
housing
yes here highlighting that
there are some real gaps and
the have serious consequences to
come this far I'd
still be short 2000000 I did talk to
jail gray this week I believe
they might be getting it but it's been
just you know hanging Care
it so it shouldn't be
that way and they're
doing this in their partnership with their
Misia valley sorry there
Housing Authority
and and service providers so
part of the set aside for people
experiencing homelessness again that's
that pocket where it's so
hard to get these developments done if you don't
have the service funding because
otherwise you have to go to hide or something
that's like I said restrictive
but I I would love to see those
projects go
through without having to do with the
the most dog and pony
show I do sit on the New Mexico
housing trust fund so
unfortunately there are a lot of prop
projects that we're able
to to fund
who've come back because prices have
just skyrocketed
but it's still not meeting the
need thank you for the
comments.
And there's also
the coalition and
homelessness at the statewide organization
right and so that also is
somebody to maybe connect
with and.
Yeah it's we're experiencing
that Senator Steinborn and then
Representative Roybal Caballero
thank you madam chair
and thank you all so much for your
presentation today
such a such an important
investing kind of an issue
for society
all over the
world certainly we see it
all over our country and
so I'm thank you for the work that
you do I mean I I think it's
truly so I always think
this when I drive by
that that serving
that community is really.
Challenging work Nicole
and Natalie
and thank you for doing you
know committee your lives
to do that work that's really
awesome.
So I have a comment
question I'll start to question
the closest for you
so we see or
seem to see more
homelessness.
The problem seems to be getting worse
all over
and.
I guess I'm just curious as
the professional works on this
issue.
What is what's the
reason for it you know
what what are the main reasons
for it and what would be
the silver bullet
policies that
could help to
address.
Madam chair Senator Steinborn
how much do this time you guys
have.
Yes as you can tell you know from
the numbers that I was reading that we
have seen increased homelessness
we know this is happening everywhere I just
went to my home town in
Oregon and I
saw.
More Polis than I've
seen in my life in
my hometown
and I've seen it in other places where I've gone
I know it's impacting every
community one of the things
that I know that happened here in
Los crucis around you know the
time of almost around the time
of COVID shutting
down and this
was before predates that
was the repeal of the
panhandling ordinance
and so that's just
raise and I'm not here to say if that's
you know good or bad it's just that
it has really made
homelessness more visible
so even though there are you know we're
seeing a lot of people in the streets they may or may
not be
housed but it has
given the appearance in the very beginning
we would get calls all the time like oh
my god there's it's increasing
there's so many people out there and we're like
we know everyone of them and
their you know might be a problem this is they're being
resourceful so that so we
started our money we model day labor
program to try
to show
people that we can. You
know help people experiencing homelessness
want to work we're still turning
away tons of people each day
who don't get into the lottery
program.
It's a city grant
to partnership we modeled
off of Albuquerque's there's a better way
program which I believe is now
defunct but we
sort of made our own again because we're
such a one stop shop
that it made sense to have people who
wanted to apply
to do late day labor services come
to the committee of hopes that come Monday through
Friday early in the morning they
literally we do
balls lottery
balls and and then we take
out 24 people to do day
labor service that work for 5:00
hours.
And you ask me anti
donation
2 of the vans go to
city owned properties
and just help with cleaning out
there we started with
one van and 10 people and
we turn 60 people
away dispelling
the myth that people who are on
house don't want to
work and I went back to Natalie
it's a we need to double this we doubled
as of the second then that those 2
then go around the city on properties
and then during COVID we realize that
we really needed a
hot spot truck so that we could
address the public health
issues of
unsanctioned encampments
around our community and to
to address those kinds of issues
that's been an amazing program
that's helped a lot of people
with income a lot of reusing
the funds they're making to pay their
security deposits their bills pay
their cell phone bill because we need
the funds to be on so we can get a
hold of them
we love that program and
I can tell you that a lot of people in our community
have really applauded the
efforts especially if they've
seen these areas
get cleaned up
there are a lot of issues
why homelessness has increased you know
we've ignored the housing crisis
for a long long
time
we have experienced a global
pandemic we're battling
new kinds of drugs in
addition addiction issues with
with scarce resources to
address those
silver bullet would be to have a
lot more of those resources
to have the services we need
not only your people deployed
out to the streets but also
having
facilities that can address
the issues that are going on in new
and innovative ways that maybe
didn't work in the past
really addressing mental health issues
really addressing addiction
issues without the stigma
that comes along with
those.
So more housing
more mental health
more support
services
does the committee hope
madam chair
this the cold is a committee of hope
to like.
Drive around services
or which call
that. Are you
you know during when it was so
hot I mean you see people
who are just crisis
out parking lots of different
situations that
the service that anyone provides
here in the town Madam
chair Senator Steinborn yes
we have an outreach team
again another partnership with the city of
Los crucis were said we just need people
to go out city councillors
mayor called me you know there's people
out on this corner please go address
it so the team goes out there we
have cooler we
froze water bottles and and
we're getting frozen 1 and 1 that they
could drink right at that time
some of that stuff comes through the funding
other places it comes from
is our generous community
who also want to help people who
are you know when it's that
hot outside
make sure that they're addressing those
needs because
it's frightening you know that's
something that has serious effects
on people who are on house in
this hot
community so yes we
do have that team and
it it has really.
Again you know when we would have people call
us and say like Hey can you
address this issue can go out to this
area would be like that persons
like not in that housing program
might you know I'm I'm serious
about my grants and what I said I would
do my contractual
obligations and now I
can be like you got it we're we're going
out and we're not homes please
we can't make them come with us are
going away but we can offer services
with the very leasing of water
we can go over and over and over
until they do trust
us and decide to work with
us thank you I know
I've called you 1000000 times
in those types of situations
so thank you okay
finally I just want to say
thank you Natalie appreciate your
presentation on the amount of housing
that we're gonna be building 900 new
units.
That is huge
that is huge and
I want to flag for
all of my colleagues here at
that last year we
passed
putting part of our permanent fund
severance tax permanent fund
towards affordable
housing it's going to start
spinning off 20 to
$25000000 a
year and now they guess
I'm wondering is that part
of the funding that's helping
us by this amount
of housing stock.
Absolutely will need that that
of funding to help us with the get
financing so
even though the city
has we have about 6000000
now we're we're evaluating
other revenue sources for
we will be turning to the
state
and we were we were
not notified that one of our
projects will be receiving state
funding so we got that
notice last week so we're hoping
that gets
advertised
I do want to know to add to
your previous question
about.
The city understands the challenge
that legislators and
and local governments are facing
around the pressures to address
the visibility of
homelessness but
to address the address the
visibility doesn't end
homelessness for those
individuals so we really have to
look at these upstream
models of building more
housing and that's what ends
homelessness and
in turn will also reduce that
visibility thank
you but on so
Representative Armstrong.
The Mexico housing trust fund
they're going to they're gonna have more
money.
Tiny homes my real
last question.
Would you have any opinions on
the whole time the home
movie.
Mexico.
Madam chair Senator
Steinborn
I've been asked about tiny homes
before specially we started Campos
open 2011
we did look into it but they said we had to
put sprinkler systems in the whole
thing and so
it was sort of an exorbitant cost at that
particular time without any funding
so we didn't do that and
instead used a different kind of a shelter
system for the outdoor
encampment
I am no expert on on
tiny home so I'm not sure I know that
those are some of the solutions that
you Albuquerque
implemented in some other places like
in Oregon
I I feel like
you know.
We need we need all kinds of
options so we should be talking
about all the options that are out
there I
think it's okay to to try some
of them I
also know that a lot of times of people that we're
working with
rely on
landlords
they might have a difficult time
transitioning into their own apartment
or if it was a tiny home that
perhaps they owned or somebody else
did that wasn't as
accessible could be difficult
but again if it was
owned by someone who could help
someone you know the
weather got ponder things like that
especially those that are
most vulnerable to have permanent
disabilities and who have been on the streets
a long time
would benefit from something like
that
from the and like an apartment
complex or something that where they
had that additional
support so it's
it should be on the table
read on and I know the
City of Santa Fe adjusted
that right they just bought an apartment
complex do
that which is really
interesting having the services is
probably pretty crucial for
certain populations
that is to be part of it.
Appreciate all your technology all
due thank you thank you madam
chair thank you
Senator Steinborn Representative
Roybal Caballero than Representative
Martinez and then representative
Duncan with that
we're getting out of here early children
less than than that
you've got your your questions it
has kind of peak there
so I appreciate that
Representative.
Thank you madam chair and thank you
so much.
Again housing
is.
Close to your
Mike.
Thank you
close to my heart because it was part
of my
work and nonprofits
and neighborhood revitalization
of creating affordable
housing was top of
the list and part
of the reason why it
was top of the
list was
associated and
it continues to be
of course.
In all of this discussion the
previous discussion
but I will you know
I I I point
as to your page
13.
Which talks about
the wages.
And how much money
wage then it would
take or it
takes in
order to be able to
afford housing
as well as all
other
necessities
and.
$12 an hour is just
not going to do it and
we've known that for a very long
time both at the state
level madam chair as
well as at the federal level
it's been a
struggle
because we get we continue
to get. It's
it's a vicious cycle
of poverty.
And in order for people to get
out of that cycle of poverty
we've got to have the private
sector
understand
how important it
is
for families
to have a.
Living
wage.
Household.
And without
that.
Then.
You know we have but
they met with the private sector
continues to say and
that is we don't have enough people to
hire we can hire
people we can't
serve restaurants
and retail and
so on
well.
If they would
look at what it
takes.
In terms of being able
to afford
the basics
then I think it's
really important because
we've we've just been battling
an up hill
battle.
For all my life time
in the profession and that
is the resistance of raising
wages and it
just doesn't make sense to me
for that we won't address
that that's a major factor
in unsheltered
homeless problems
in that's been coming
to the fore madam chair
with all the surveys of the nonprofit
to do work in Albuquerque
and Santa Fe and
Los crucis that
you know wages is the key
issue so I tried
tension to that because
it's not going to go away and
$12 a stock we
ended it for minimum
wage at $12
when it should have
continued
on the spectrum of
of going up rather
than ending or stopping
at at $12
so I have
a
I'm wondering if you
all are a
member of the national
hello low income housing
coalition.
Madam chair of
Representative Roybal Caballero
we are not we're not but
we are involved
with them so you
know attending meetings
webinars best
practices that they put out so
we're we're very
involved with them and
and will
continue to be self
so madam
chair asset because they
are tremendous source
of resource they
provide lots of
resources and
connections and strength
and I think that the
more of our state.
Nonprofit that in a non
profits that are involved in
housing affordable housing
the more that they could tie
into the national income
housing coalition as members
would be a strong
argument
today it's kind of
ironic that we're on this
topic but and I also
sit on the mortgage
finance
Committee and I here
rather than over there and it's
been a struggle
with the mortgage finance authority
to understand
or to break away from the
bureaucratic
of way of
operating
and not addressing
affordable housing in
the manner that they should around the
state but I
think when you're part
of a national coalition
and our statewide
coalitions as
advocacy as
advocates and and
doing advocacy work
it says a lot to
be able to move
them in the direction
it should be because they only give
us data and
that's relevant to
their bureaucratic Reports
they don't provide data
to us
like you have
of the needs
and so I I bring that up
and so the other
question is
we have a high number
of veterans that are
unsheltered homeless and
we know that from
our experience that
a lot of our veterans are suffering
from PTSD and other
mental health challenges
and so do you find
that and being a high
number here and
in Los crucis street Community
of Hope
and also how
will are you able to
work or tap into the
veterans administration to be
able to assist you
in providing
housing to our veterans.
Madam chair Representative Roybal
Caballero
we has serve more
veterans we serve before the
449 number
so we see those numbers increasing every
year we do have
VA funding so we do a
supportive services for veteran families
grant that allows us to have
supportive services for veterans
and then short
assistance for rental
assistance oftentimes
our vets that's all they need
sometimes of the need longer term
assistance and so in those particular
cases we might roll them into another
one of our programs that they have the
assistance they need one of
the things that we did
that was really helpful for
our community was partner with our
local Housing Authority to
take over a 22 unit
complex that is strictly
for veterans as they're transitioning
out of homelessness into their own
apartments and have an on site
staff person there would capital outlay
funding to build a resource room
a training room for them
they have activities there
and just to have somebody there to advocate
for them when there are mental
health issues or when they're late
on their rent then that case
managers running over Community of Hope
saying what can we do how can we
help this veteran who is is
struggling right now
we also received
we get some last year
Fund at like end of the year funding
from the New Mexico department of Veterans
Services updated cut
all that funding in the field remember
a few years back they and you know
really cut back on that funding
and so
we didn't receive anything
from the state but now
if they have money left over they will
call and.
We will use it.
Thank you madam chair and thank you and I
think that that the Community
of Hope will serve our
service as an excellent
model how
to holistically
approach
through your one stop in other
ways state you'll have
pulled in
various sectors of the community
under your I'm
Bella Representative I
if I can interject just because
also at 1..
point
You know I'm going with this
okay do you want to go ahead its
operational their own yes
thank you because I was called into
the wrong thing yes
several years ago
there was a push from the
White House to end
veteran homelessness into it and it
as quick waves mayors challenge
to end homelessness
so we partner with the city of Los crucis
with the VA
other HUD Vash workers
anybody that we can get to help us with
our efforts to end veteran
homelessness released operationally
and veteran homelessness
and within just a few short months
and part of that was that partnership and
having it a dedicated apartment
complex strictly for our
veterans really helped us
to transition as many veterans
as we could on that by name
list and we
became at the time this
is a 2015
because. I
was I think in
labor later that
day.
When we announced that we were the
thirteenth at city in
the nation
to operationally and
veteran homelessness when I look at it now it
says tents so I don't know 3 people got
booted or for what happened
but it really
just means that we're able to transition
backroom within 30 days or
less and just
really have a preference for
veteran housing.
That's a very significant and
thank you madam chair for bringing that
up because that is very
significant and and
it it goes
back to what I was saying
that the rest of the state
should look at this as a model
because this is an effective
model and that you've been
actually of
housing veterans
through your
connections and relationships
one final question
I get over and
over and over again
throughout traveling around
the state but in
Albuquerque.
There is these notions
Center dispel
these I I want to dispel
these these
notions that
are traveling
around our
communities that.
Homeless people just want to be
homeless name
you know maybe they
there no
matter what you do to help.
On either get them off
drugs or or help
them get drug
rehabilitation or
any other type of social
services no matter what
we do are many goes
in and then they're back at
cycle in an out of
services because they
prefer to be
homeless and I
you know I've I've gotten
into literally
almost physical
battles at
times
because.
People don't want to understand
what you just described
as some of the
questions that percent Senator
Steinborn asked about the
factors that affect
homelessness and on house
to.
Communities.
How would you answer that
question.
Madam chair representative I've never
heard that just kidding.
I hear it all the time as well
thank you for the question
while I cannot to propose
to speak for somebody who is
experiencing homelessness and the reason
that they are there
it's been my experience than
that when
I first started to community of hope we did
have a family shelter
and when I decided to stay on the
Community of Hope I
asked the director at the time if
we could house all the families in
that family shelter
and we we
talked to her about it and they said go
for it and so I learned how to
go out and and attract landlords
to getting a voucher and having a case
manager in their homes and started house all
the families
we house 12 families and only
one ever
came back and it was just
for something like a past due
utility
bill.
So I think that that it's
it's not necessarily true
especially with our HUD funding with
certain thresholds we have to show
housing stability are people staying
in their homes for at least 6 months or
more are they increasing or maintaining
their income and year after year we are
able to prove that the
clients that we're serving.
There are people who do say they
choose to be homeless and maybe they
do but
I also think that if
you could imagine sleeping outside
night after night
through the heat through the
cold watching
your back being physically assaulted
sexually assaulted
repeatedly
that there's a certain
trauma that happens
that makes it easy to give
up many
of the clients you know if we had one
woman who's staying at camp hope for
quite some time give us like
we have this house for you it's just for
women you can live there and she would just
say I I don't deserve it take somebody
else it's somebody else's
turn although I'll go when it's my
turn just like it's your it's your
turn today
so I I do think that
it it is something that gets thrown around
that is not quite
that is absolutely
misunderstood.
And I appreciate transfer that
so very important
because we as
legislators just as
you all
doing
the the
work.
The hard work it
takes courage
it takes compassion
it takes breaking down the
stereo types
it takes looking
at.
The entire
wholistic social
economic
issues together
in order to be able
to
and these
cycle.
And I think we all
need that courage
that compassion that
understanding what I just
described when
we're making decisions
and when we remove ourselves
from that then
madam chair these
of false
narratives and notions
takeover because and
then that's we're driven by
fear rather than
by of courage to
take action and
that I think is an
important lesson
that you demonstrate to
us because you're
absolutely correct
some there's
those
and I've run into
individuals that
are just so
traumatized
that they see no
light at the
end.
They're not there because they
choose it it's the trauma
of their daily living
circumstances and it
takes what you just
described so
I keep doing that
don't take no.
Find the way that's
the only way we're going to be able
to break the cycles and I appreciate
your work very much thank you madam
chair thank you
Representative you know
couple things that
I'd like to point out
Nicole had mentions that there
is a home that is specifically
for women who
also may have some disabilities
that is called sue's house
Missy valley community of hope is the
landlord for that
there's also the program
since tent cities
are not funded by federal
grants the Community of
Hope has
has come up with Nicole came up
with a brilliant online
social media program
and I was the
chair of the development committee at the time
so we really kind of Max that out that
was called to instruments if you want to
look at 10 strands.org
the goal is to raise $125000
right now.
And I would not be doing my due
diligence I did not talk about that
because what what we're finding
is that you know it's it's it's
really we're we're bringing in
everybody into this in Los crucis
is showing to be very generous community
in a very giving community.
But the agencies that are
doing the on the ground work are really
having to come up with those things and I'm
really grateful that we've got
creative minds that are that are
working on those
but you
know there still there still is is
more of a need and lasted
like to point out before I go to Representative
Martinez than representative Duncan
and then Representative little
is when Nicholas talking
about the the tiny
homes
in tent city in in
camp hope and if you ever
want to see this you know
connect with Nicole and
Natalie because it
truly is this like this
brilliant.
Thing that just came together
after deciding
the determining the
needs
is that in in camp
hope because
if you have a 4 sided structure
you are required by city
code the city code
state code to have
sprinkler systems.
In this
so because
Nicole is an avid camper
saw 3 sided
structures.
Those do not require sprinkler
systems.
However tents
that folks are living in
get a beating from our
son and from
our wind and from our
temperature so these 3 sided
structures are means
of kind of at least extending the
life of the
temporary homes of these folks
are are living in at the moment so
is a really thought I'm and
I think even even the state was
like oh yeah we can think about
that.
If they if they didn't they should have
said yeah we didn't think about
that so those
are some of the things that are happening
at them see valley community of hope so
I would strongly encourage
you to look at that
and and also top but
more you madam
chair just real I remembered the third
C. okay where it was
quickly passion courage and
creativity there we
go. Thank
you Representative
Martinez.
Thank you
madam
chair.
And I was part of the
leadership team
in the early 2 thousands that had
to make the decision to cut
funding and that
was.
If if I could
have filmed
that meeting I
think people would have a
different.
View of
secretary fox and
I because
is very emotional.
And there was a few words
that were let out
that probably was
good was that was not
recorded
and and
secretary fox being
the man of honor
that he is
came down told face to
face these were not
going to be phone calls
we flip the coin I got to
go tell the victim he
got to come down here and tell you and
although it
was a small amount of
funding.
I remember secretary fox calling
you soon as he left you and
said.
You think goes emotional one
you and I met he
says the I'm gonna need to pull
over.
I said what happened he
said.
They thank me for the funding
and said they're not gonna stop what they're
doing.
And
that is
selfless.
And for what you've done for my
veterans here
I'll be forever
grateful.
I I've known I've
talked to a lot of these
vets
Wilder lights for you
reaching out to them and
maybe they have not come to
you and told you that but they've told
me that.
So I want to thank
you because what you
do is an extremely Frank
this job every
day you're out there
every day you're putting yourself
out there and
it's that kind of
selfless service
that
inspires me.
Truly.
Thank you for what you've done for my
bets down here
it's
exemplary.
And there were some
organizations when we cut
their funding were
clear about their.
Unhappiness with
me.
But.
Your response
was like we appreciate
your funding
but. We're going to
keep doing what we're doing
and you've done an incredible
job.
And that will
always
be
something that I carry
is having to make those hard
decisions.
But.
You showed what
somebody
with.
Court for
mission.
It's all about the mission with
you it's never been about
Nicole it's never
been about lifting yourself
up. It's
been about lifting everybody
else. To
thank you for what you're doing what you
continue to do.
And for not beating
up my boss when he came down to
talk to you. Thank
you madam chair.
Thank you Representative.
Representative
Duncan.
Thank you madam chair how do I go after
that.
I'd say let's call it a day
and struck
the gavel.
2 quick questions for you one
is you said that had was
restrictive.
In what ways are the
restrictive and what would you do
different.
Madam chair representative
Duncan.
Depending on the the hud program
that the client is in you can only
serve the
clients in that program
so we don't have the discretion
to above and beyond go
out and serve other people in the community who
aren't covered by some of
the hard requests that we
have one of the
requests that we have from hot is a coordinated
entry entry grant which
prioritizes people for
housing who are living on the
streets but
there are things
like you know
you're
there are certain
thresholds that people have to meet
in order to say like you've been homeless long
enough
so now you can be
prioritized for housing and
and so some of the systems have some
serious flaws in terms
of the discretion that's why
I was advocating for more
flexible funding sources
so that we could just
you have a knee jerk
reaction and had on the street so
we needed to and somebody needed us
and not only focus on
the grants that were given to
us
that is the I'll take for example
thank you so much for your words Representative
Martinez in our
veterans I wouldn't use my veteran
funding to go surfing
on better and so
we have a lot of requests that are really like
that take that really seriously
I'd love to have discretionary services
to just go out and dress what's
happening when we're talking
about you know the this coral
program trying to get support
of services it's gonna be
really hard for them for their set aside
units for permanent supportive housing
or you know the unit so we're
trying to build on the Community of Hope campus
I'm gonna the other one
we used had funding but then there
so many years they have to been
homeless for full year or 4
times in the last 3 years that up to
12 months or a permanent
disability some of those
things that make it really
difficult
to get people in who we know are
eligible
and I would love to
be able to just tie supportive
services to that development I think it
would. It
would incentivize
and it would
make many of our
communities much more open
to partnering with developers
for affordable housing and doing the
setasides
for people who have been experiencing
homelessness.
Thank you madam chair
and follow up question
would a different question
would be how
then do we do
we.
Advertises probably the wrong or
how to how then do we
do we look at investors a
state.
We're going to take care of you but
you you
what we do to get
them to say
this is what I want to
build.
I I deal with her for a long
time and and
I had a great relationship
with the folks in my
County
and and once
in awhile as a as a
blend of
Lorton as an owner
I got burned.
But by far and
away I did not
so so that's my
question for folks that are out
there they're saying
maybe I'll build
maybe I won't hi
we what we do for them how
do we convince
them.
Madam chair representative
Duncan I think it's a really great
question
and I think that.
You we've utilize the landlord
mitigation of funding
and I think if we had something like that it was
a statewide model I know CYFD
is doing a pilot program of that as
well to ensure
that if landlords are getting burned that they're
compensated for
that
and you know I I do just wanna
say there's no data that says that somebody
who is experienced homelessness
is a worst tenant and somebody who's never been
homeless there's no there's nothing to prove
that so you know our our motto
is how's everyone
and it works out and sometimes it
doesn't but to incentivize
developers again I think being able
to say like all then there's gonna be
set aside to come with all these
vouchers we are so
voucher rich unit
depleted so I have
vouchers that you know it's taking a long
time for us to house people because we
just can't find the
units so with those
setasides you know it it's
really easy for us to put a
voucher on that
and then you have that service provider
right there on site so when people
are having their what we like to call big
behaviors we can
address them as they're happening
and try to make sure that we're mitigating
that situation.
Thank you madam chair it is
are those rates up to par with
what I can get in the private
sector.
Not always hut is
always sorry
madam chair
representative many
times the the federal
government is that a delay to what's
really happening in the market but
that's where that flexible
funding come come
and so one of the things we're looking
at the city of Los crucis
is coming in with that gap
finance get financing
for those rental vouchers
so if they're
able to put a tenant maybe we
could just come in with that extra
0 or $200 to
subsidize that
piece at the voucher doesn't
cover and that
would also incentivize those
landlords and give them the ability
to to access both
the risk mitigation and then
for the city to get a public
benefit
I know I think covered in my presentation
but as we think about
economic development and
I know we want to bring new
industries and but in order to
do that or to have
that retention and
recruitment we have to have all
those housing pieces in
place
so if if we can bring
a fortune 500 jobs
company tomorrow and they can
create 4000 jobs but
if we have a 5000
unit shortage there
were causing compression across
the whole system
so
again I'll echo the housing is
for everyone so thank
you thank you madam chair that
thanks for your answers I appreciate
that.
Thank you representative Duncan
Representative little.
Thank you madam chair
I want to thank you so much for this
presentation it was probably
one of the more for me
and and my new
experience coming in as a
legislator one of
the really
informative
presentation I appreciate it
very much
so as I was sitting here doing
the math
he gave the example
of of
what a
the average winter renter
wage needed to be
to as we
were discussing 30 percent
of of your and
a gross income being
set aside are estimated to
be used for
for
housing
so.
What I figured out calculated
from that and
I math may math may be
off a little bit but
I
also.
Found without any
adjustments being
made just
straight $12 an
hour
wage for 2080
hours a year to see
average number
of hours worked by an
individual
would result in
30 percent of that would
be at
600 $24
a month in rent
and that that's the 30 percent
of of an
annual wage of 20
4000
960 making
$12 an hour
and so we've discussed the
that the the
homelessness
are on house
the issue and the
housing of
that says all of the
options that are being
taken.
Are being put upon
the
being considered to
mitigate this problem this
issue. I'm
I'm curious about I'm
of section
8 vouchers as
well I'm wondering and
this might take us madam
chair might be
it another
question
but I'm curious about
how what experience
do you
work with those to you
because as I
understand it as I'm
trying to understand this
a person who is
eligible for section 8
vouchers may choose any
property
and it but it's the
landlord that's willing
to.
Utilizes vouchers and
accept them at and
the difference to be
paid through that
voucher what's
the experience here with
the and in here with
your organizations.
Madam chair representative
little thank
you.
We.
It has a couple of different
pots of money to have the section 8 for
low income people and families
and they have had continue of care
that's the same thing the vouchers work
the exact same way but it's for
people experiencing homelessness
you have to verify
their eligibility through their
homelessness either through a a
shelter verification
or would sometimes we take pictures of
their car if they're living in their
car so it it
works the same way we believe
in honor client preference for
housing they choose the unit
sometimes they choose to go into places
we own sometimes they
just want to work live somewhere
else of the different landlord and
then we talk to that partner and
talk about the benefits of partnering with the
program they're going to
get you know the rent
subsidized that they're going to get
a case manager in that unit
every month more if
needed
and so it it mirrors
the section 8 program
and oftentimes our
we see it as a transition for our
clients to transition into
section 8
where they don't have to have services
that's another main difference
ours you can't
require through housing first we
offer it the they
think it might be required for
that black robe effect
but you know it's it's a
step where than they just going to their own unit
they're managing their own rent based on the
case worker through section 8
but they're not providing the
support of services like Community of
Hope is so ultimately
we like them to.
And you know resolve and and pay all the
rent on their own in many of our clients
do but we
we utilize section it
often.
Thank you madam chair thank you
for madam chair and I would also
like to note the city has a
home tenant based
rental assistance program that operates
just like section 8
we're lucky enough to partner with
both the Misia valley Camino
but we also partner with
our local domestic violence
shelter so we can ensure
that
victims of domestic violence are
able to transition into their home
quickly
and you know
reduce that time
within the
system.
Thank you both so
much
erected I
I I would like to just make a
a final kind of closing comment is
that we're all kind of one catastrophic
event away from from losing their
homes we
can be either health crisis
it can be losing our job
it could be domestic violence
it could be sexual assault
and so I always
appreciate when when
folks demonstrate
empathy
for that what we've
seen though today
are examples of what can be done
and what other communities can benefit
from and I
appreciate that Nicole and Natalie
actually share that information all
over the state but
I also from the questions that
were asked today see a genuine
interest from people who
want to make sure that that
these issues are addressed in their own
communities because
what we've seen at the Community
of Hope in the partnership with the city of
Los crucis is really a model that
works
and as we are experiencing
or as we are seeing people more
people experiencing
homelessness
we're seeing that what they are providing
as much more valuable than we
ever ever thought
before
you know representative Armstrong is out
of the room but I
think that you know she is
also going to be able to take away
examples
and and I was going to say I'll be her
back up dancer to her fiance
to help argue for
that said
she's not here to hear that but hopefully
she'll be able to do it
he will share it but the thing
is is that when when you have
these issues in the community
you know I'm I'm I'm off right
I certainly am not as eloquent
as Nico Martinez
or Natalie green now
I'm not thanks thanks
thanks.
That.
They are.
But please know that you know when
it comes down to presenting argument or
at least being able to share the examples
in the experiences in the programs
that are happening at the Community of Hope I
offer that up
even though I always
defer to the call
when it comes down to that
and Representative Martinez
thank you for your comments I think
I don't know if I was chair of the board at the
time when you had to go and make that
conversation but I'm
grateful for what you said
so thank you for
that. We have
just a couple of things a little bit
of housekeeping please pick up your
trash
I would like to think done in a community
college for being such great hosts
for us and allowing us to use the
building on Monday also the jury patak

association providing a lunch that
day also John how are you
all don't have to sit here and listen to this

comments and your questions about
the issues that were presented

next meeting will be in Deming and
Silvercity September 20 through the
20 second will be talking about the
hotel and mall renovation tax
credits challenges and
needs of the New Mexico wine
industry challenges and
successes of the small distilleries
and breweries I think
we're also going to have economic development
there and
we'll be working out that agenda
Aaron will be sending that information
out to you but my
goal is to have the agendas for the
remainder of our meetings that
so that we can get that going on
that note a reminder that any
legislation or resolutions that
you'd like for this committee to be considered
for endorsement
need to be started
with Martin right
now and it
will be submitted in full
complete not in the draft
form by
the time our September meeting
ends and
then we will discuss
those in a boat on
endorsement or not
endorsement on our very
last meeting which is October
13 that
day will the morning we'll have
the public bank
and community bank corporate
bank our panel
that I'm very excited about and then
our afternoon which should be fairly
short we'll be dealing with
how we endorse of legislation
so just to kind of give you a heads up
about that if you're
going on the tour of the
baked chicken
farm cannabis farm
you all received information
we can leave from here
they I thought we're gonna be early
but then Erin had to to
text never mind we're not gonna be
early because you all are
so interested in the
topic at hand so
we are going to go ahead and take
our own vehicles. Out there
and you all have received
instructions on where we need
to go but I know Scott you're going to go
ahead and you lied
that caravan or something
and so
vice chairman if there's any
closing comments
you want to
make.
I just want to say thank
you to everyone
who sponsored us
who have who
the who played host
to us over these last 3
days I especially want to
thank the nonprofits that
we're here today as
you all know I'm did
most of you know that I'm into
an executive director
for me see that I because I here
locally
and
you know it's it's dated
a hard work that
we we do for our communities
and it's so
refreshing to
see
our nonprofits
coming and sharing that with legislators
because I think so many
times
the disk you know
many of our communities don't
understand that
there's a hold up when you get
funding because he we here all
you know what we gave you
junior money we have if we
can't get it to maybe October
November maybe sometimes
December and we all
have to come up with our
budgets there's
so many roadblocks and we
heard about the code talkers
and you know that important
mission so I think it's such an
important
piece that we got to here today and I
hope that we can go out and
continue to talk about this and
other committees and make
sure that we keep
raising that level
of of communication
what that we heard this
this these are 3 days
so I want to think of
this committee I I always
we think we have a good
time.
And I think it was a good information
so thank you
all.
Thank you I sure appreciate
that we do have lunch to
go outside
thanks again to the Burrell College
I'm I do want to acknowledge that the
bean is a locally
owned and actually
where owned business in town
and so I think the Burrell
College for doing that and also
I believe those amazing pastries
and scones were provided by kind
bakery which is a woman owned
business
so very very
glad to have the
think local first as part of that
that value of this committee
so on that note we
are going on our tour of big
check and then after that we will
officially adjourned but I'm going to go ahead
and gavel today
at this moment so thank you everybody
for those we tuning in for the webcast
hope you're entertained and you learn
something and committee again
thank you for all of your time and I
appreciate you so much
so at this point
it's 1156
and we are adjourning.
