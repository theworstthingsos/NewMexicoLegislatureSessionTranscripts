You're taking.
Representative.
Represent
present everything.
The.
Representatives.
Matter myself.
Yeah.
Thank.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
Man
manager.
Yes.
The.
Madam madam chair I have a
question about the rule.
Maybe.
It'll clarify something for me.
Since the vote.
Was taken last time in the same
people arm.
How does that fit into the.
The.
But but the committee has
changed.
So i'm wondering how the rules
play in.
Thank you for that matter and
thank you for let me ask.
Good morning madam terry good
morning many members house will
to forty one is a bill you've
seen.
This was the third time I have
seen it twenty twenty two twenty
twenty three and now again this
year
the difference between this
between this bill this year and
four ninety from last year is
another adjustment and annual
salaries.
So
where we each year that this has
been run there is a four percent
increase that's been added
once this legislation gets past
it will be tied to the cpi and
it'll just.
The.
Um.
It's pretty straight forward I
will say that the fire is
incorrect this actually has no
impact on.
So well I guess I can say that a
little bit differently there is
a an income tax impact on the
state in the mexico because
there's also go up a hundred and
sixty five people may be paying.
But this effects at the end of
the day with me is grace philips
general council for the
association counties and chair
with your.
If you don't mind i'll have her
say whatever she was said.
Thank you good morning madam
chair members of the committee I
am grace philips with new mexico
counties this is a priority.
Officials have not had a raise
since two thousand.
The.
Bodies passed.
And it's it's never been a
controversial.
Think about him chair
representative thousand thank
you for carrying this but remind
me what happened the last two
times did the buildings not
make.
Thank you madame chairman thank
you for leader of the bill made
it to the house for and it was
supposed to be heard the
saturday before session ended.
For whatever reason it didn't
make the house but it was still.
Yes ma'am yes manager or leader
well I I am.
I support this in it and I don't
know did you have the cpi.
I'm sorry the c p I last time
yes cause that's.
Thank you.
The.
The.
Thank you manager thinking.
The.
The.
Good morning madam chair and
committee members hospital or
hospital moral forty three
request the
consideration during the interim
for a
rule review committee.
When i'm sure this this.
We go back to
back in time.
Our state agencies were given
get we provided them the
authority to do rule making.
And.
We did not allow ourselves the
ability to review those rules to
verify whether or not those
rules were consistent of the
legislation in the laws that we
as a as a body pa.
I did have a house bill.
For this for romaking as well
actually up.
Two more voice out of this
committee than I did last year
when I read that bill and so
always memorial that the that
you know every year maybe we
don't be closer to this but at
the end of the day I feel very
strongly that
we are the lawmakers.
And we should be the ones that
are reviewing.
How rules are implemented across
the state in the mexico
we can go and depth on this
where I can just I can stand for
questions.
The.
Do you know if.
Is there a congressional review
of.
Madame chairman jordan for later
i'm not sure about the at the
federal level what I can tell
you we're one of the very few
states that don't have some
oversight on legislative review.
Most states have some version of
us
so many.
To my mind is how when I
get my regular emails from
interim committees on which I
serve with rule making.
For the departments I don't have
time to read them.
Read them and so I would be
interested if if at the federal
level where are they are full
ti.
And.
Ample staff.
That makes more sense to me.
Our arrangement now of volunteer
citizen legislators.
With so few days in the session
and.
Task and i'm not saying it's not
worth reviewing the rules I know
th.
The.
Abide ba.
Procedures they have to have
public hearings.
The.
Open you think the.
So.
That's.
Council.
I know I think it deserve this
committee
madam chair and representative.
Madame think you madam chair and
thank you florida leader uh
I understand where
we're we're having this debate
at.
We do run out of time and do
doing our day job and do and
doing this as well.
But
and I think as I closed on the
house bill.
The weed.
One of my comments was that
weren't working.
And and.
This gives us a jump start with.
Putting different things in.
In the.
Madame chairman majority madam
majority four leader I think
that.
This is one of those things that
helps.
Those that are pushing for
modernization.
Get some justification behind
the mo.
Madame chairman and madame
majority floor leader.
I oppose the modernization piece
of us.
But at the end of the day
if we're going to do that what
are our response.
When this body chose to give up
its ability to make laws and
allow.
A agencies to d.
I think i'm chairing out of
majority floor leader what
happened the summers is a very
good proof of public comment.
When we look at the from the
education side last year.
Laws.
After.
In allowing this allowing the
school districts to choose.
Almost every school district
came out of.
The five day school week.
Or a hundred and eighty days a
year almost every one of them
the amount of negati.
The resident.
Way out
any of the positives that were
come and f.
Stop them from.
Madame chairman majority for
leader the same thing happened
with respect to.
The I i'm one of the few and
maybe the only legislator that
actually testifi.
Listening to the comments that
with respect to that reviewing
all the documents and i'm not in
attorney and I didn't stay the
holiday in left.
In opposition against that did
not.
So I think yeah we do have a
problem chair and majority floor
leader with respect to our
ability.
I started this I started a rule
making bill.
The
in my first session this is now
my this was down my fourth
fashion being here I started
this I didn't introduce a role
making bill until two years into
this.
The.
From the outside always working
on different pieces of
legislation as one thing.
On the inside looking at it.
Understand the process well
enough.
And and to go through some of
the rule making for two summers
to see where we're actually like
the issues are a change that
bill.
And introduce it and.
And twenty twenty two.
Or twenty twenty three.
And then this year we changed it
again.
Restrictive.
More over have the oversight but
not to have.
All the restrictions I did on
the first one.
Trying to push that through I
think man of chairman majority
floor leader the reason why I
got two more votes.
The this year versus last year's
because of the changes as I made
in that I still think the.
Giving giving our state agencies
complete autonomy.
Over rules.
I think is is.
Poor practice on our part.
We write the laws.
With her we agree with them or
not once they're chaptered it
goes over to the process.
Of of roommaking and we have no
oversight with respect to that
the only option we have is if we
don't like the rule run
legislation again.
My five.
My whole intent on this is let's
start.
Fighting ourselves.
Let's use the rule making
processless get involved with
the rule making process so that
we don't have to fight.
In right new laws.
To to get rid of a bad rule.
But stop it in the process and
make sure we're all part of
we're on an agreement.
Floor later.
The.
Thank you madame chairman thank
you represent it for for being
here today and I just had a
couple of questions so
I sit on the interim the mexico
finance authority oversight
committee and we approve rules
for things like
you know what loans were going
to give out and the the process
of that madame chairman
representative with this kind of
be similar to that since we are
looking at the rules and then
approving them.
This would be madam chair and
represent a but this would be a
version of that.
Not every one of our interim.
You don't do that if if we
recall from the from the actual
legislation that
we discussed last week.
The.
That required us not to look at
it with less if it had an impa.
It was one of the reasons again
why I think that this.
I got two more votes and I did
the year before with respect to
that because no we don't want to
bug everything down.
It is pretty apparent when rule
making is not approved by a
residents.
It's very crystal clear we see
it now the newspapers we see it
on tv and and we hear it I are
residents spoke loud and ped.
A resident spoke loud.
The summer and there were
several other ones this summer
that that we went through as
well so um.
No word this would not review
every rule.
And probably be full time
legislators thank you madame
chairman and thank you
representative and I would I
would be inclined to agree with
you on that
so I when that the floor leader
was talking I I just googled it
real quick about congressional
rule making and I believe
they've in nineteen ninety six
or the congressional review act
and I believe madame chairman
this applies to final rules
including major rules.
And interim final rules so
whatever that means on the
federal level madam chair
representative I think the it's
cool that congress has kind of a
check and balance and I I cannot
think the certain this idea of
yours is pretty cool so thank
you madame chair and think you
represent even thanks for
bringing this forward and i'll
continue to research and look at
your bill thank you manager
thank you
senators and more.
The.
The second.
On you know.
Representative black.
Yes.
Poor leader chasing
like.
Representative hockman vehicle.
Representative little.
Represented ream
representatives and more yes.
Management.
Madame chair.
Not her representative category
I appreciate your thoughtful
summers
we have a department that
doesn't even publish rules
corrections i'm.
I also.
In my own experience don't from
when I was in field of early
childhood special education and
that department I human services
department would publish rules
most of the people who went to
the hearings were against the
rules I mean
if you like the rules you didn't
and that was that really so I
think it's hard to say.
I representative of the.
But I do think it's worth
have having a legislative look
at the process.
The reason I don't think this
memorial is particularly l.
If you don't make the
legislative council.
And.
And you said it's your motive
kind of predicated on the
modernization
so that that was kind of my
thinking but I I do think it's
a.
For people to follow the rules
when I was
doing
court appointed work in sand of
all involved.
And I just while it's.
I I mean
I was glad I knew what the
rules.
A problem but I don't know that
this is.
Madam chair and that was
essentially my point I wanted to
think the representative for his
persistence and is the eyes are.
And just explain th.
Class benefit.
The tide modernization is there
but it's about staff and time
and putting this mandate there
without dealing with those
issues is lacking and funded
mandate according to the fire
this would be two hundred grand
every meeting that's about two
million a year so you're a bill
was on target with the money
but we don't have power to
change rules that's not our
constitutional perview so it's a
cost without a benefit i'd
really like to see you carry a
memorial next time on a
reexamination of the rules
process the rule making process
and see if we can get.
The.
Thank you madame chair thank you
committee will see an extra
here was at it.
Representative I need order yes
representative black noted table
florida chasing.
Representative how can I be held
to table representative little
yes represent ream.
Representatives and more know
the table.
Manimous chair
madam chair.
Yeah.
Let's see.
The.
Different things three or two.
This is an actually.
The.
In the military o.
There's certain things the
federal government would like
to.
We are asking that the military
spouse pro.
Or the us cost guard were.
On bees.
The d standard.
Higher than in most states and
seventy percent of our.
Military families live off.
So there are exempt when there.
We're going to try to move
and the only the.
Ensure that current.
Within the existing state anti
discrimi.
The polic.
Yeah.
Not just military members and.
Impact.
Service members and.
As under the list of.
Human rights act.
The last thing is that we were
defining aren't forces.
Um we are adding.
Of our forces in.
We have to region.
And to vietnam veteran and the
internal bi.
I really railed.
Anyway madame chairman remember
the committee what we're trying
to do here just be fair.
And and you want to do some
instant in mexico and you can
get licensing or or the
discriminate kind of against
you.
New restation.
Do a little.
The.
And if in the questions.
The US department of defense and
the US.
The.
I would call them.
Madam chairman better chair
members of the committee
they've covered.
It's getting very competitive.
And they seriously look at.
Uh the effect they look at
everybody's laws and see how
friendly they are to mili.
Madame chair if I you know when
you join the military didn't
republi.
The.
Yeah.
You know in our society now it's
too bad that we're getting
divided over that.
If it was.
Thank you.
Yeah.

secretary of defense and is that
the center of our national
defense strategy the policy
changes expressed within this
legislation support our focus on
insuring a high quality of life
for those who serve our country
including their families were
very grateful for the tremendous
support that that that new
mexico has previously made it
and is currently making the
support are nearly twenty two
thousand service members and
more than twenty thousand of
their dependents living in this
great state we appreciate the
opportunity to support the
policy reflected in HB three o
two and especially like to bank
representatives syrian for
speaker heading this effort
thank you.
Yes thank you madame chair
members of the committee I stand
strong support for this
legislation I am a member than a
mexico military based planning
commission and the curtain
partnership committee this is
badly needed among all of our
bases in the mexico thank you
madame chair.
Thank you so much madame
chairman and thank you all for
bringing this great legislation
forward as you probably know I
represent al gordo which is in
military town and we are trying
to do everything possible in
almogordo to make it as
welcoming to these airmen and
their families when they come to
visit new mexico and hopefully
stay in the mexico after the
retire so madame chairman
representative my only one
question for you can I coast
sponsored this piece of
legislation
because this is just very
important to me and i'm so glad
it's been brought forward
representative only if you vote
for
I will matter
the chair
thank you.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Of.
All.
The.
Preserve this.
License.
Madame chair and thank.
The.
I have a question on space for.
And I think.
Yeah.
I'm chairman representative
there.
After do.
Us congress in the president
created the us space force.
Three thousand at the individual
station.
Are in the US.
The.
Rapid keeper.
So there are about three thous.
Yeah.
The.
We only recogni.
Very important if you're.
For that answer matter.
The.
The.
And and in our country as a m.
The.
Is that part of what mode.
When I was looking at the
analysis first I
thought this was mainly.
I was I thought it was about not
h.
We wanted to say is.
The military has had the best.
I was working in early childhood
special education we were trying
to get
early childhood programs
certified by the now.
All of the department.
And when the dinner school was
going to go work as secretary
of.
Indian affairs.
You need to.
Certified.
I'm not quite sure why this
isn't being put in the civil.
Because the civil rights act is.
Primarily and it's not purely
for immunable conditions.
Yeah.
Now I I ever bended.
And two major.
But then I also.
I.
Accommodation
and one of the arguments and the
senate side was that this is a.
There's no change
benefit here so
we did end up it's it's signed
in its in the law now and.
In this.
So it was there no.
This.
Particularly the spouses like
when they go to get a job
there's a whole organization.
Struggle for them is advancing
their careers.
You know while their husband
just are with us in the military
so.
You know they well we don't want
to promo.
That long so these the human
rights act out of covers all
those.
Yes madam chair thank you and
the III didn't hear who last
book of
pretty the expert witnessed by

Contained
all of the areas that the
Include education are i'm sorry
employment housing public

add just that a vehicle that
that matter

Thank you very much.
Until about five minutes ago
that new mexico sta.
Under its doddy and unit quote

brand new branch of the military

For it to
added
to our state.
There was a bill last year to
recognize the.
Okay well once again mine blown
so thank you for that
