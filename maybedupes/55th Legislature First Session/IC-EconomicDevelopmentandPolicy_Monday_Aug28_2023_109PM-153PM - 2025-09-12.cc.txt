All righty were just a little bit past
1:00
thank you again to
jury but Czecho and the
border industry association
for providing our
lunch it was a
locally owned woman

say my favorite part of that dish
was the best
refried beans I've ever had in my
life.
Thank gap
so thank you
very much for
supporting our locally owned businesses
and especially our women and minority owned
businesses a
couple of things you do have
a flyer in front of you that has the
activities that are going on in
southern New Mexico for the next 3
days thanks

a an event tonight ability
cruise on behalf of union
Pacific
tomorrow
my colleague at the greater Las Cruces
chamber demi Moore and
they are going to be hosting a reception
for us at the end or live
their avocado tacos are
amazing
and then once the afternoon one of the
most creative names for a
cannabis farm is baked
chicken and we have that
thanks to us got Scanlon
and royal Jones
so
Debbie has asked me
about a show of
hands of folks we've
kind of geared about maybe
40 people but
the reception just by show of hands how many
people plan on attending and
if you've got a spouse's going
raise up both
okay.
That's tomorrow night
tomorrow night one night
okay so
roughly let's
count to for almost
everybody okay

Yes Sir
showing.
10.
Just talk to them more about
that but
so thank you and
so we kind of gave for that ball park
of that so Debbie
who is
most likely listening to
this
I would say plan for about 40 to
50 from because
folks are gonna be bringing their
spouses.
So it's a 50.
If that looks good and she's
probably going yes madam Senator
thank you Debbie and
so we've got the rest of our
afternoon just a
reminder after
our 245
a presentation
we're gonna be talking about logistics
which may sound I
know it's very exciting and from
what people have heard about already
what's happening out here at the border
industrialists association
it will kind of make sense we are
having a tour
later today so just
to kind of keep that in mind
as a lot of this will all
come together when we see the
tour
but then after our to
15
panel then
we are encouraged to we at
we if we do a public comment will
spend some time on that
then we will drive our vehicles
to 1200 Country Club
road which is Billy Cruz
restaurant the bus
will pick us up there
take us on a tour of the industrial
state issues association of
the whole area and then take
us back which is where reception is so
we don't have to drive all over
the place.
So also
we have a quorum now
we have a
2 honorary
members are to advisory members that
have been
bumped up promoted up
to be
actual committee members so
Representative I'll clone
and
representative Duncan
but also we
have Senator Shendo
here
and
on your non New I'm gonna say it
right I've got it right here I have
to tell you I like have it
right here on in order
to thank you I in
order. We'll get
there and I'm my apologies I am
making a genuine effort
so what we have to do we
have to do a little bit of business because I don't
like these things to pile up is that we
have meeting minutes
they are in your folder
of equipment from our June
meeting in our July meeting I
ask that you look over those right now
because we do have to vote to
approve those.
This is not something I try
to get this done because it's not something
I want to do with our very last meeting
is approve every single meeting
minutes so
that would be kind of a nightmare so if you can
just take a moment to look over the meeting
minutes.
And
of by your guy
goes moved to approve the June
minutes we'll do them separately so the
June minutes Dr second on approving
the minutes Representative
Madrid is a second on
approving the minutes all in
favor of approving the minutes say
I. In a
opposed.
K. the June minutes are approved
thank you very much looking
over the July
minutes.
All moved by your
greatest moves to have
a second.
Representative Armstrong has a
second of all those in favor
of approving the July minutes say
I. Any
opposed thank you
very much July minutes are
approved.
You what I've spent
most of the you're not at the
meeting okay well thank you
so sendo is not a
counted on any of
those.
Yeah make a note on that one
of.
And the
all right so
we you can tell this
committee this committee is
very energetic
and very curious and
they like to ask questions which I'm
saying as a term of endearment because I'm
really appreciative of having gauged
all of you are in
one we're bringing in our speakers
because they are here
at our request and I'm
grateful for that so Dennis it's
just going to be you our state is not able to
be with you.
Okay all right so we
have Dennis Malone us with the account
executive for areas will want to
just. And
so the floor
is all yours
fantastic thank
you in a
previous life I
was an aide to
John cook so this is
all kind of familiar.
So thank you for the
invitation thank
you.
To Mr but especially
for keeping me in mind and
he told me I was the first one he called
for this so thank
you.
The power point everyone
have a copy.
Okay so I'm Dennis
Malone is
I am the account executive for
Aries. Our
worldwide logistics
we are
a.
1 stop shop
founded in 1984
in Houston Texas
we have branches and
Laredo.
Fort worth.
And we have to
in el Paso.
And December
sixteenth twenty twenty two
would probably open the doors here in Santa
Theresa.
And it went
swimmingly
so. We
are global freight operations
center with multiple
operations
around the globe.
We do
quite a bit of cross
border
transportation
business
work with the Micaela
notice
all basically
from Pueblo up we do a
lot of
appliance
moving appliances
moving auto
parts
and I'll go the into that
further.
We are the only true 3
PL and some that that
is
when I say 3 PL
we are third party
logistics for.
There is one
competitor but
that competitor is
married
to Foxconn for
20 years and can serve
no
other.
Clients so
I wouldn't categorize
them as of 3 P.
a true 3
PL.
What sets our company apart is
that we are all about
information so if
you had
let's just
say.
Yes leather which is
a client of ours in el
Paso.
If you had yes leather
you would have your eyes
on our information
247
we even have it so you can
actually drag.
Pallets into a virtual
cart and
my team has it ready for you the next
day for transport
anywhere around the world.
So that's
what sets us apart is
we're very high tech
we're you name
it we have
all eyes on freight
so page 2 actually
page 3
we do a lot of ocean
we do we send and we receive
a lot for the medical
industry
a lot of contract logistics which I'll
be going into momentarily
we are.
Probably the only one to
do foreign trade
zone brokerage in so that that is
a.
We
have a huge
team of brokers
that transport that
actually do the paperwork
I myself in
a previous my immediate
past previous career
I was an administrator for
the foreign trade zone for all
passed so for the
International Airport
anyways we
do a lot of air freight.
A ground freight packing
and of course compliance
is huge
when you're
running.
When you're ready freight for the likes
of Tesla
BMW Johnson
and Johnson
and.
Electrolux
we do a lot of
oil and gas
in Houston let's get
to what Santa Theresa
does page 5
so on your
tour today you'll most
likely pass by
my warehouse it's
150000 square
feet
it's.
What. El
Paso cannot offer
and what this 1 offers
is the
4242
foot high roofs which
means I can go 6
levels
which is fantastic
so we jumped on the deal
full service
brokerage.
The border is 2
minutes away.
The rail is
6 minutes
away.
Fantastic
CBP something that just
a.
Was.
So easy to work
with assist
by Jerry.
Assist by the Dona
Ana.
Inspectors.
In el Paso if I wanted
to open up
a.
Duty free warehouse
which is what an FTZ as
well especially stated
that he's going to sell.
Which is a duty free
warehouse
if I want to do that in el
Paso it would take me 18
months. I
did in 44
days.
So.
The one client that we
have
that really wanted it out
of all the many we're
now saving that client
$72000 a
month
in just duties.
That they have to pay to the US government
so it's a
fantastic went all
around so FTZ
thank you to CBP it
was so easy to work with
the.
Next page okay here's the
maps.
You see the branches.
You see where we are we are
at we're at 655
industrial.
We.
Are doing about
22 pick ups a day
from the rail.
So that's our truck
our trucks.
Our test fees picking
up from the rail and they're just
going in a circle
so this
customer probably the
hugest maker biggest maker
of washers dryers
refrigerators.
The campus in water is is
over 3000000 square feet
it's a monster
but that client is of course
Electrolux.
The product is being moved from
Malaysia
Thailand
China
Taiwan.
To LA because of the
Long Beach port
when you get to the Long Beach
port
it spends another
3 weeks there
and the getting off the
water into the
rail.
But.
Where we we
on the bottle necked if you
will would be at the
rail instead
of having to wait
for trucks to go
to Mexico.
To the side I'll pass
so now they just
come the 7 minutes so
we're pulling.
A container of let's just
a refrigerator compressors
we're pulling our pre
the that
container it's coming off
as soon as it gets there
and the U. P. did a great
job by going 247 did
you I don't know if you guys knew
that.
December first twenty four
7. So
fantastic so
we're pulling these containers as
soon as they hit there's no
more detention fees there's no
more demurrage fees
there's no more extra brokerage
fees so
would easily were
saving our
client 1.$2000000
a year just by moving to
center that just a
and having that FTC there for
the.
So
as I included a map
of the U.
P..
As you can see
we we do get a lot of real from
Houston but.
80 percent of course
is coming from so that that is
a of our
freight.
This is the one I spent a lot of time
on set that this has
the unique geographical
H..
3 minutes from Mexico
7 minutes from the rail
10 minutes from my
10
I know Jared was telling me about
some improvements to our
craft.
Which is going to
be really
good
because.
Sometimes you can get backed up on
our craft I
think the changes about
to happen to that major
vein
are going to be very
beneficial
and then 40 minutes from I.
25.
Now Jerry at
his monthly meetings which
are we're.
Very happy to be members of
he's been talking about this new St
Francis bypass
which is something that
you guys are out that this committee
is working on as well
that's going to go
from the.
So Senator port of
entry basically
you'll be able to get
to
kind of the main area
where a lot of the mosquitoes
are what is.
Our craft we talked
about you're
going to have a
Jerry's been talking about the new
runway at
the something that is
a which will
mean
we can maybe start
to look to sell some of air
cargo that's coming straight
to something that is.
If that happens
it's gonna be huge.
If that airport gets a cargo
run way with.
The ability to unload
pallets because
what you have with the industry
is a lot of hot
shots.
You have a for
example.
The new color of Electrolux
washers and dryers a slate
blue I don't know you're going to
see. You're
gonna see a lot of washers and dryers
slate blue so these washers
are these appliances
are coming.
And the hot shot up from
Malaysia from
China so
if we can hot shot a
container or we can hot shot
40 pallets.
St so that the rest of this is
huge
huge and
then of course in what is we have the
new one adopted by pass
which means my
trucks will be able to go
south.
And actually go
around.
Occur to the macular
area in.
And what is
so.
I've lived.
The 2 miles from
here for about 22 years
now.
I have been a competitor
of juries.
For about 8
years.
You know what I was
telling you know
el Paso for a while.
But the I got a chance
I got a chance to work for
the really good company and
they needed an FTZ expert
they needed somebody with a
lot of
credentials I
did open up a lot of
FTZs.
You know pass up
so I convinced the
owner of my
company
K. you know
he's. All
the gentleman played in the NFL
the.
And I said Hey man you gotta take a
chance you need
to take a chance on on so that
that is a he said
look I already have 2 branches are
Dennis so
I finally sat him
down with
the a couple realistic
ISIS Adam down with
Gerry said I'm
down with
the.
And we got it done
and then I pushed hard
Jerry Knowles I came to him
February twenty twenty
one and
I don't think he believed
it but we got it done jury
so we have
room now for
15000 pallets
I have 11000 in
there.
I really have to thank all
the authorities security
has been great
a lot of my corporate that
the securities can be an issue it's
not.
It's a fantastic place to
work
my commute is 4
minutes.
And Jerry is
the type of person to
he's a go getter I don't know
where you found this guy but he
is completely
hands on.
Yes I mean the most
no bureaucratic guy
I've ever met
so he convinced he
helped convince get it
done.
I think we're 2 years ahead of the
curve.
I think areas is 2 years ahead
of the curve because.
They're starting to develop you'll see
in a couple hours when you take the tour all
these buildings going up all the
skeletons of buildings
going up right now
you're getting a lot of
wire yes you're getting
the turbines
but you're also going to start to get a
lot
of
consumer items
you're going to start to get
a lot more
appliances
dell is looking to move in
here of course
you have that big one
Monty that's
coming in that does
copper so easy
this is nothing to poke fun
at I know the east
side of the pass was a lot
but I think.
It's it's coming
soon like I said we're
2 years ahead of the
curve.
We're going to fill up this warehouse
we have a 2 thirds full now
so.
It's been a success it's
almost been a year
so.
That's all I
got.
Thank you I put the thank you to the
VA the U. P. has
been great they've
let me bring customers
in. And
then imagine bring in
the brass of Electrolux
street from Stockholm
to visit with the U.
P. I made a
fantastic.
Fantastic so
of.
And then of course your some of my customers
the last
page.
These yeah
to Shiva
Okamoto.
We're doing a lot of
liberals
you know for major car
companies
but this warehouse right now
is full of Dyson
vacuums and
all Electrolux right
now this in the sale of the rules
you're talking about like just the seat
covers like the the materials used
to cover the seats and all that the
upholstery in the cars yes madam
chair it's it's a lot of
Tesla Nissan BMW
Honda leather
that I have as well
yes.
Other questions from the
committee.
Madam yes
Representative go ahead
goal thank you for the
presentations.
It is kind of just
been really for me.
I
it's. Can you
please explain to
us why.
Products from China
and different countries wind
up right here why
don't they wind up on the
east coast west coast
Houston.
What what do they want to your
because the
magic of see
that what is
you have
these enormous
campuses
Representative
where there's
2000 people
and they're just putting I mean you
can I've said I've set there
and they're just putting they're
just washer dryer
doors just coming off the ceiling
huge
campuses.
And what is is
where a lot of what we
consume is made.
You're talking about Puebla
all the way up Pueblo a su
that to our what is
but what is of
course the
more Santa Dennis
that can
be strong
with. The decision
makers and what is
the more we can
offer.
For companies.
To locate
here I think
that the governor's
office did
offer to pay 60
percent of my
forklift driver salary for the
first 3 months
months and that's
amazing I mean they just
Jerry just kept setting up
these meetings for
me.
Offering incentives so
the touch your question
Representative they're
coming from the U. P.
everything's coming off
LA.
And going straight.
Through the U. P..
I mean if if oil container
came off a vote.
In the M. from
China.
I could be a trucker
$1800.
To bring the container of
refrigerator compressors to
me.
I can put on the real for
500.
So you
know. That's
why and then the U. P. this
this is a huge up
so everything sent to the US
is poised to be
it just a heavy
weight.
So I want to clarify when you say the
U. P. you meaning you Pacific
now thank you for the upper
peninsula for those
people might be familiar with the
west yes the
UPS
yes.
This.
Thank you madam chair presents us
all with our great thank you
Representative little then we're gonna
go we're gonna go Representative
Garrett Representative little
and with a representative
please.
Thank you madam chair thank you Dennis
for that I just want to make sure
I understand
so if
we what we have the
runway
east Asian trade
drugs can come
directly from
there east
Asian
place in Landon
center traces that correct
that's correct I have for
example Johnson and
Johnson G.
C. X. I have
integer have 3 clients are
the medical and there are
things that have to be
hot shot
it
which only can be done of
course by air
to Japan
to Malaysia back
and forth.
So the runway would be a
boon to the local
economy to
have something we can just hot shot
it straight to a
runaway.
Thank you madam chair one more question
so on the foreign
trade brokerage
yes when goods come
into Long Beach harbor
for example
and their board on your trucks
where did they go through the
customs process is that
there or is it
in Santa Theresa
so the 4 trades on
the has the advantage
of putting drugs in
bond which means no
duties are
due
a in the commercial economy in
till it gets to our FTC
wants to
FTZ
FTZs
for the layman just consider them
like a Switzerland
there's they're neutral they can't
ask you for any duties
for example the steel these
refrigerators and cars 18
percent duty 18
percent of
$1000000.
So the
foreign trade zone yes your
question Representative it
keeps it in bond.
And then when it gets to the
union Pacific.
We pull a
of a service specialist
form which keeps it in our
warehouse and we can keep it
in an FTZ.
For 100
years.
Thank you and just one last
question sure for a while
the prolong which was really backed
up has sat what's the
situation now yes
I just spent
2:00 hours on
Thursday.
Electrolux is just
pounding me
because
there's a flood in one of the real
lines so you
have.
That big storm that came through
California so
I'm just I spent last week
just trying to calm
the the
initial X. people down
in water is nothing
you can do I mean that's just a
natural act but that
that was a strike what you're referring
to and it's
back to normal
supposedly
there is a website where you can
track all the boats in the
ocean.
It's just crazy
what's going on with all the traffic
3 traffic
but.
You can assume a good 2 weeks to
unload your freight and
another 2 weeks to get on the
train.
Or you can pay triple
and.
Relatives of on an
18
Wheeler.
Thank you that's it thank you madam
chair thank you great
thank you Representative little and
Representative
Mason.
Thank you madam
chair.
Thank you Mr Malone is for
your presentation
today
I'm curious
about the terms
even using I don't want to presume
anything so can you
define hot shot for me
hotshot is when
a a line
will go down for
example in the water is
Micaela Lara
let's just say they don't have a
washer and dryer doors
to keep the line moving
if something's in danger of the
line stopping.
It will need to be hot shot
it which means our
hot shot means and expressed
move that
means.
It's a box it's a
container it's
a palette of something
that will have to be there
immediately to get.
The line to keep running
because a line stoppage
of that goes all the way
up to the owners of
these $0
companies so hot shot
is basically
a super express
movie
I've even had my guys
hand carry things testable
and back so I
mean it's it's
a mandatory
move.
Now with holding
anything.
Thank you very much that's very
helpful
the madam
chair.
And Mister Malone as as
you were
describing.
I'm curious that your proximity
to work into the workplace is
wonderful I mean just a few
minutes how many others
are employed by
your company and
I'm curious as to the
careers
of the career paths that
one might.
Pursue if they were interested in
this field.
And that's the one
thing about
warehouse logistics and
brokerage in moving freight
across the globe is that
it's B.
sides.
Running a supermarket is the
safest job in the world to
me.
Because everyone
consumes but
to answer your question
Representative
I I have a
crew
of 44
in some that that is
a
the majority I've.
I would say 90 percent of
them living gonna deal
live and
New
Mexico.
They are making
above
more they're making
definitely more than what they would
make
going to
Texas.
And there are several of
them that are in their twenties
making.
A good
salary.
40000 plus
I have 324 year
olds making
40000.
Which is great.
Because.
I mean it costs a lot to
buy even a talk with
these days.
But. So
we are definitely
invested.
And madam chair it's just a
clarification like what types of
jobs are are these are come
representatives of these are
IT coordinators
a lot of computer
peripheral
related
people that know how to run
a scanning machine.
People that know how to
unload a truck
with 45 pallets
in it in 45
minutes.
People that are well versed
in speaking to a
Electrolux.
Tesla BMW
I mean you name it
the account Representative as
I called
the.
It takes and of course
security
so. All
kinds of people.
But the
44 are employed right
now said that this.
8 thank you very much thank you
madam chair thank you.
Thank you Representative little
Representative
Mason.
Yes.
Well about the
this really
increase.
You set your mind goes
for can you but
we're.
No it's on.
You used duty
free how do you become
duty free
another for the cheating the
government out of money or close to
it
no
back in the new
deal
1933
FDR and.
Invented
FTZ.
In and he invented
it to create jobs
so you can manufacture
you can manipulate
you can.
You can do just about anything you
want on important
material.
There are over
294
FTZs in the country
and those FTZs for
example.
Take vengeance still
everybody knows Vinton
still there
on the highway it's
a big steel company
they came to me in the
state. We
got a 25 percent on this
Chinese steel.
So you think
about a guy that's
importing $1000000 a
steel rods he's got to
pay.
25 percent I'm not good
at math but
250000 yen
so he keeps it in
their May well
that those rods get sent
south.
To create something
market flat and to make a
refrigerator door.
It goes back up under nafta
so he just
saved
250000.
So FTZs allow you to
manipulate
store.
You can do quality control
you could do just about anything
you can it's the
highest level
that CBP affords
anyone
so I think there's
about.
There's 2 in center
that is a high risk of those me
and the other one
and there's about 18
and help us the county
so it it takes
you have to there's a lot of
reading to that goes
on.
But is
the highest level.
The teamviewer 14 others were
because you know we're always talking
here the government they
put. Representative of
the.
You'll see more
are feeling some
company yep
in the yeah
so. They
can. Get
some of them can get if they're using
it for another purpose can
can bypass those
those that we have
and they were under threat
for awhile the FTZs
during the trump administration
they were threatened to do
away with the program
but.
Jerry myself
part of a big association called the
national association for trades
on so they're very
powerful lobbyists in
Washington
so.
Yeah we support each other but
a lot of the stuff you consume
is is FTZ.
All lot of clothing
lot of plants
is.
One of the leading on your employees
yes Sir do you use a lot
of contract and what your truck
drivers and stuff for the actually
deploys of your company
that's correct our
employees our trucks
I have 7
gentleman
that.
We've hired with and they're
just going around in
the union Pacific yeah
they're going to the U. Pacific they're
just making a circle
pulling pulling pulling
all day.
The most of your employees are
employees of the company you don't use
a lot of contract
let's talk for a
forklift driver
I will use
a temp agency for 6
weeks just to see
because I have a policy you know if
you if you drop
in a you
can keep it
so.
But the.
Some betting your employees also
yes Sir it yes
Representative yes
thank you thank you
Sir.
Thank you representative Representative
Madrid.
Thank you madam chair and
thank you for a great
presentation I want to
throw out something that just
saw about 2 weeks
ago here in the
Paso
MPO
and that was
a what do you
call that
Thomas
wrote.
Systematic use
of in which
is the railroad
goes over has its own
track. Goes
over the side
and it's a.
An arrangement they have
where they're able to pick up.
Of these the containers
we're going back up on the state of
Minnesota Tom service
people at these
warehouses.
And it's an
interesting
concept because I think
we're it talks about
moving more
into a carbon freeze
so this doesn't do
that what is your
perspective are you
anticipating some of this in the
future it can be done for
a presentation and
then took a heavy
every week but if
other people a little faster
because one of them was
part of course are considered I
think it was mentioned earlier
in the discussion
about Torneo
being a a concept
site for those and
right now I got to say it's just
a room for
picture but rather only moving
up fast what's your
interpretation
Representative Representative
Madrid at I think
I would agree that whatever
this committee can do
to bring something like that to something
that just a.
It would be very
beneficial I think that
the transportation
in this area
is.
Much better then
a couple miles of
east of us.
If we can get some kind of synergy
with what is.
To get people freight
rail.
To go in and and the
circle without minimal
intervention
kind of like the trusted traveler
program across
borders I think would
work but this committee
should definitely focus
on investing transportation
dollars that of
it. Thank
you madam chair and I
would say no it
really caught my eye because I I
do know that it's under
consideration on cell to
the cell was also
consideration
over there Antonio
and I think
it's got a great potential
even when we take
central we
look at 20 own
Fabian's
what is it Sapporo all
of those are real strong
developing a
manufacturing
corridor on our
side so it
leads to my next
point no to what
I call and and then it's
just a minds of
highway 50 fourth US
50.yes and
that is a north south
corridor that
has a lot of vitality in
this particular thing caught
my eye because the
first time I ever got real
interest was people from
Houston port of
entry that they saw a
real need to come up this way in the
to could be something done
offer that 54 they were very
much interested in my only
purpose of suggestions such
a thing of this if
it becomes of
an issue for the
Torneo area that we
could still maybe still do it on the
St because it's a
it's a full circle we just
moved in some places
early it's still the
same outlook
for Texas people
that didn't want in their
backyard to mover
transcend and it moves it right
back over off of
54 page
like us Senator Griggs
says 546 of
46 on the
struck into Chicago
it's a has a Roni and I
see that is another
possibility for
it's anybody's such use
up to consider those
options because it
lands on alternative
to 1 sometimes we have
bottlenecks yes
yes did
the new by pass the that's
going the
2 downtown I'll pass was
going to help a lot but
whatever this committee can do to
get that kind of high tech
transportation I know
for.
Things are moving slowly but
they're happening
for example just in the past
month I've noticed that all my fed
ex packages are not coming from the
new so that that is a
facility instead of the east
side which is
great
which leads me to my final
slide if I may
the
challenges.
The. They're
8 points that I can think
of that.
This committee could kind of look
at.
I know
that.
The governor is going
to
Taiwan.
In
34 months from
now.
So things like
that these are called trade missions of
course right.
More global marketing
of the so that this
area
more trade missions
to places like
Taiwan
to places like stood
guard the
places like stop call.
You know more train more
involvement in European
trade shows
would go a long way
more funding for membership
drives and groups
like the border industry
association I
think that when you have somebody
like Jerry
the more
that he can put under his umbrella
the better
more many more marketing and
outreach
there's a very powerful group of
what is known as group will
index.
And they our
brotherhood of
property owners and Micaela
Lara Harper
Jerry knows about them very
well but more
outreach
more spending
the day with these groups
more.
Meetings with these kind of groups
and in
Mexico.
Fourth one producing of Southern
New Mexico logistics
trecho.
I think that would be
really really is
something that that would go
a long way
just's for manufactured
interested in moving to something
that just a you know
kind of a
you know maybe use
this place a whole have a big
fair or something
Rick reinforced professional
recruitment
you know if I need a
technical
I'm looking for an assistant
warehouse manager right
now
I'll be reaching out to
do.
Women agencies to provide that but
more technical advanced
more
computer.
People trade
missions to the Far
East.
To some that that
is.
And then.
Maybe visit.
Some fortune 500
people owners seen
across the world
and then of
course.
More outreach to
organizations like Rylan
and FTZ R.
Riley is the retail industry
leaders association
and there are
huge I mean this
is where Walmart and target
go to buy their
supplies.
So there are
some major
major.
Organizations.
That pretty
much finish everything we see and
live and work and drive
and we can
easily join these organizations
the state of New Mexico can easily
walk into any right
look conference set up a
booth and say Hey we're
here and
we want to get your
business quarter of
the year most of these
organizations require a feat
I know right let us pretty much
higher and
but any FTZ I
think I'm paying
about 1800 a year
and it's a very pop
organization
they put a lot of events
but there are several organizations
like that textile manufacturers of
America.
There's so many.
But the. You
might put somebody like Aaron
to just research Hey what
can we join.
And what are the perks of joining
X. Y. Z. so they
they would put somebody in not
necessarily Sarinana
saying just that you know
somebody just research Hey
what's you know the
the Munich fest the
world's largest trade show
I mean it takes 4 days just
to walk around that
place
that there's over 40008
that
alone.
Representative go
to.
Are there any other questions from
the
committee.
Thank you very much all right thank
you very much I know
that we are a little
remarkably we are ahead of
schedule.
So what we might do because
I think we still we're still waiting for
some other folks to be part of that
panel that you're on
RigCount.
