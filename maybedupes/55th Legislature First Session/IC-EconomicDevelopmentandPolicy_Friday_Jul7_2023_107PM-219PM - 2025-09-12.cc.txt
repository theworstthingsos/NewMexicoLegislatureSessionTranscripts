Thank you the folks here at the
table I realize that in
my mic on but sometimes I don't need a
microphone.
But if the webcast wants to hear me
then I guess they do they do need to hear
me up
as we we've had this
discussion in
this committee of
kind of a new normal after
the pandemic but there are
a lot of folks who've already been
at that party that of
the pandemic brought the rest of us
to
that are
are grateful that
we're having these conversations
and you know one of the
things that we found a lot
that during the pandemic was people
with working
remotely.
And the benefits
to that in there some certainly some
drawbacks but we know that that
folks are productive
when they they can work
remotely and have
flex time and all sorts of stuff but
one of the things that we.
Also need to consider
and what we have our
panel today is really
advocating for
is how we
can better support
our employees who may have
disabilities either visible or
not visible
and many through
through the pandemic we saw a
lot of those invisible
disabilities really kind of
surface
that we needed to be
sensitive to as employers
and as as people who are working
with other folks with
the situation so
we have robin garrison who is the
voting an assistive technology
team lead and advocate for
the disability rights of New
Mexico we have
Bernadine Travis who is the director
of program services of
for disability
rights New Mexico and we have
Casey stone Romero
who is the director of the vocational
rehabilitation division in the public
education department police
thank you for being here today
and what we'll do
is we'll turn it over to
you so that you
can go ahead and give your presentation
and then the committee this is a very
curious committee
and so I'm sure there will be
questions and
then we'll we'll finish off today
if we have public comment will have
that available you don't have
to stick around for that machine of course just
want to talk more
after this so I'm I'm
gonna go ahead turn it over to you
and I'll let you do rock paper
scissors to see whoever talks first or
if you've already got that planned
and will just want to make
sure that the microphone is on
as pin pointed out you've got to turn
that little person
there you go.
Yes that.
I got one
is
active.
7
ready.
Okay thank you madam
chair and
councilmembers we appreciate
you inviting us today
I do want to acknowledge someone
in in the audience Jim
Jackson who
was of the previous
director of disability rights New
Mexico and who is currently
are lobbyist and many of you
know him well
so just to
acknowledge that
we are here today to talk
about support for people
with disabilities and
employment
there's a whole array of things that
goes into this and we
are talking about the
Americans with disabilities
act and section
504 of the rehabilitation
act that
provides protections to people
with disabilities
there's not 1 size
fits all and that's really
important to know
that every disability
is different everyone's
needs are different everybody's
abilities are different
and that's kind of where
DVR comes in
and you know
there services are individualized
for people with disabilities
and employment and
accommodation should
be
individualized as
well it's an
interactive process
and that's something that's really
important it
really is up to the individual
to decide what kind of
accommodation they may
need in
employment
and it's up to the employer
to say well that's not reasonable
and why it's not reasonable
but it's a given taken it
as I said an interactive
process that we want to make sure
people know
a disability
is 1 or more
things it affects someone's
major life
activities
so it could be anything from
seeing walking
breathing
learning self care
there's a whole list
that we have if it's
under the
ACA.
We also want to
make sure that people
understand that people with
disabilities have the right to
equal access.
And that's we're
disability rights comes
in we are the
designated protection and
advocacy
we provide legal advocacy
to people with disabilities
every state has
a disability rights
like ours
arses been around for
us since 1979
when Mr Jackson founded
our agency
and we have grown from
him doing this in his living
room 225
employees we provide
statewide services
we work very closely with
DVR to make
sure that people with
disabilities receive
employment services
and the goal is for people to
get off of benefits are never
gonna live
well on budget it's
not really a living wage
and so most of the
people that are on
social security or
below the poverty level
and they can't afford the rents
now so
they need to work and
there are some programs through social
security that help people
work
and try to work without
losing their benefits
and we encourage people on
social security to try to
work and DVRs
considered what's called an
employment network
under the federal program
of to get to work
and it's it's
called to get to work to help
people try to work
so the
other thing that disability
rights looks at is that
we would like for New
Mexico to not
be a sub minimum wage
state we want
to get rid of sub minimum
wages we are
currently
in litigation with that with
the with the particular
employer
we want to make sure that people
with disabilities have access
to employment that is
satisfying that
that takes care
of abilities
into consideration
that they have equal access
exactly
exactly
that
disability etiquette is 1
of the things we were going to talk about
today
to. Stability is the
term right now
handicap is not the term
that is
used
we.
Sure sure that
right. Right
right. Right
the word handicap comes
from the term
of backers on
the street corners with their cap
in their hands.
So it's it's a
derogatory term
so and
with the passage of the DA in
1990 people first
language became
is so people with
disabilities
so there disability doesn't
define them it's a characteristic
of them who they are
so you don't say that the
blind person it's a person
with blindness or you
don't say someone the wheel
chair person whether or not
a wheel chair person there person
first in a wheelchair
and so those are the kinds
of things that we want to promote
is that people
are people first and then their
disability and their
needs for that disability
are just characteristics
so we don't say the glasses
person.
State senator
that
that's right now that's a defense
right.
Right so are
we disability rights New
Mexico works with all
ages we do
special education
issues when
children are not receiving the
appropriate
education
we've been working on some things
called the school to jail pipeline
right now to
there are kids that are not receiving
the appropriate services and
school and they end
up in the juvenile justice
system
and so we've been working with them
DVR works on
our pre employment transition
services they're required to by
the federal government
impact the required to spend
15 percent of their budget
on pre employment transition
services which
Mr Mero of the stone
will tell you
about
the other thing that we work on
it right now too is we go
into facilities
it which there's
been a lot of a press
about facilities for
people with developmental
disabilities in the in the
news lately and
we've been looking at those services
we go into.
Mental health facilities to make
sure that their rights are not being
violated that they're not being held
against their will and
that they receive appropriate
humane treatment they're
receiving that mental health
services that they need
and I've got to be honest with you New
Mexico has a lack of
resources for a lot of these
people people with mental
illness people with traumatic brain
injury
and so
finding resources for these
folks this is really
difficult
so I'll turn it over to
rob.
Madam
chair.
Are there I'm on about
that thank
you for inviting us again this
is Bernadine said it's it's
great to be out here and share
information I think that
that sharing of information is
critical if we want to make
any kind of impact and
services for people with
disabilities
I always say most
people live right here which
is understandable but
for this you need to kind of
broaden that and you need to kind
of see outside of your own
experiences to
understand
I'd like to talk to a little bit
about what are the issues we see
with employment which is reasonable
accommodations
and we
get issues with
people working for the
state but also people working just
the general public that a lot
of businesses do not
understand what a reasonable
accommodation or modification
in the workplace looks
like and so
it's really a simple
equation
but it's just
not
whether intentionally
and from some cases I've had
unfortunately that does seem to be
the case are unintentionally
it's not something that that
is offered happens
for people and then they lose
employment in their back in the
system and in that awful
cycle so
with a reasonable accommodation
you know the ADA
basically provides protection for
people with disabilities
enter the definition
of burning again
to allow them to
request a modification
or and or an
accommodation so accommodation
would be changing
how the work process is
done in
order to allow the person to
fill the the necessary
functions of the job okay
and modification would be changing
the environment
to improve
you know have a stand up table
or and
and in the case of an accommodation
example could be if
someone.
Hat is on medication that
causes I mean
frequent urination then they get
extra bathroom breaks if that's
if that's something that they have a policy
on I mean there's all kinds of
options is as you can
imagine
again reiterating
every disability is
not the same
even if it's the same thing and I'm
sure my sister wouldn't mind me
saying her and I have the same
visual impairment we
deal with it very differently
and have different techniques for
for handling how we work
with it and that's
a genetic disabilities
so you can't get
any closer than that.
But just reiterating
its a very individual
experience and
and should be treated as
such
so the purpose of the reasonable
accommodation modification
is to make sure that people
with disabilities are provided
with an option to to to
meet the essential essential
functions of the job
with with whatever
accommodations they might need or
modifications they might
need
but the copy out to that
is that this that whatever
the accommodation of modification
is it cannot cause
an undue burden or hardship
financially administratively
on the business
and they
still have to be able to perform the
essential functions of the job
so there's some
interesting things in there that
played but that's that's why
we have what's called the interactive
process
these accommodations
and modifications apply to
the application process
also you have a
disability and
the you're in an interview and they
hand you something you can't read you
have the right without penalty
to requests in a format that
you can read that's an
example.
So.
That's that's kind of how the
basis of
that
and what it does again is it
allows a person with a disability
to to perform
the essential functions of the job
they were hired for it
allows them to enjoy the
benefits and privileges
of everyone else
that everyone else experiences
while employed at that business
or company or
agency
and and those are the 2 main
goals of these
accommodations and
modifications
and the process is basically
that a person with a disability
can request some accommodation
or modification at any
point of employment
where they where they feel that
maybe they're they're having trouble meeting
this essential
functions
and and and
then that you enter
into the interactive process
and I think that this is really the
part that's really missing
is a lot of times I'm
getting clients were being told
flat out well no we're not going to do
that for you sorry
and they have no recourse
and they try to appeal it and nobody
is listening and nobody's working
with them and that
is you know quite honestly
in direct violation of what
the ADA talks about
as far as accommodations and
modifications so
I feel like like
that's a really important
issue to remember this
interactive process is
critical this is a give
and take of ideas this is
where the person can say this is
what this is what the problem I'm
having is how can we work to make
this work for me a little better
so that I can provide
the services I was hired to
do and
the interactive process is never
ending so
you you create an
accommodation or modification
if anything changes with the employer
or the employee
that requires us to be re
adjusted then it needs to be
re adjusted and you enter back
into the reasonable accommodation
modification process the
interactive
process
I find that a lot of times
that's what's really missing
I've had multiple clients
recently especially after
COVID where where
the that's the situation
nobody is going through that
process
and that. Obviously is
not
helpful.
These these
accommodations and
and modifications are
specifically
aimed at people with
disabilities but but
I have had a few clients and
I wanted to bring this up as well
who have family members
with significant disabilities
and they are
not being provided with
options to work around
some of those issues
you know there's there's now
we know that hybrid work
is is really a thing that
works well for a lot of
people.
It doesn't have to happen but
I I I think that we
need to really consider
the families
I you know know a single
mother she's she's
got a significantly disabled
child she you
know she could really benefit
from being able to have a
hybrid schedule for
when the care givers that she
has still aren't
available and that
is not something that private
or public or
private or or
even the state to be
honest acknowledge too
much
and that is really
problematic for that much that
person I mean she may end up having
to take an early retirement to
take care of her child
and she's a great
employee by all
standards and so
I I think that
in discussing what
can be done to help
people who have
family members or have a
disability themselves
those 2 issues are really
at the top of my list
you know make sure
that there is an
80 coordinator or someone
who can handle the
interactive process and
and the accommodations request
and make sure that
this is extended
to.
To people who have
family members with significant
disabilities and
for there to be an option for
hybrid work for these
people
so that that's a lot of
what what I have to say
on that
so.
Okay.
Okay. Madam
chair and
Committee I wanted to
mention that we have have
state employees that have called
us and there
is not 1
specific
person who handles
reasonable accommodation we
talk with state person
and they said it's up to
each agency
to decide what their
policies are on reasonable
accommodation so
it's really confusing for
the employee to
try to figure this out
because there are some
the par some agencies that
we found that have just said no we're
not doing any reasonable
accommodation like we
that's not something you have
the ability to do it
has to be an interactive
process and the other
part to this is that
we already know that these
employees
are qualified to do the
job because they've been doing
the job
so they have to be qualified
to do the essential functions
of the job with or without a
reasonable accommodation
so
this was a big
thing for us about
3 months ago when
state employees have to go back
to work and
there was no 1
office that handled
the there
was no ADA coordinator
and some agencies and
I I don't know if Casey can
answer that but
there's no 1 agency
that has the ADA coordinator
to say here's what the process
is no 1 seems to know
what that processes
when ADA came into law
in 1990 everyone
had ADA coordinators
and those have gone by the wayside
they've been added on to
other people as duties
and so there is no
1 who really knows what that
process is even talking
with legal counsel at state
person they said
well we have
policies for us
each agency has their
own
so
you know there may need to be some training
with state agencies
about what the requirements
are.
One of the issues that we see
too is some of these people in
the the the second
scenario is talking about where
someone has a family member
with significant disability
and and I'll just add
this because I always started with my
trainings every
single one of
you. Everyone
in this room will experience a
disability if you live long
enough that's a fact
disability affects everyone
and that's if you're lucky
that you don't get a 2 year
later in life
so it affects
so many people and I'm
sure many of you in this room
have family members with
disabilities some of them probably
significant
what what what these
people with these family members are
being told is use your
if I'm away
well in in in
a couple cases I've been working
on there is not enough
FMLA to cover this
time.
This one person has a
child who
is not old enough for day
have which is where a lot of people with
significant disabilities go during
the day and get care and then they
go home at night
she's she's not old enough for
that she's too
old for a
child care and
she has through disability really
makes that a difficult thing a lot of
places will not taker
so when school has
extended vacations
this single parent has
no options for her
child.
And so and it's not like she
needs a lot of care she needs
someone at home with her
that's all she just needs some
mild supervision while she's
home but this is
the situation you know that
a lot of people are facing either
with their parents are with their
children
and so I I think
that that's something that really needs
to be considered across the
board on all
levels
in
case.
Would love to hear from you
okay.
Madam chair members of the committee
my name is Casey stoner Meryl
I'm the director for the division of
vocational we have
I have been with DVR for
about 18 months and
previously worked at DVR for
18 years
I love the HSD
I will tell you I think we are
1 of the best state agencies
in state government
for a couple of reasons
number 1 we get to help
people we
do not deny services
to people we no longer have
a wait list for services
which is very exciting so
anyone who comes through our
doors can benefit from vocational
rehab services as
long as they're eligible and that means
that they have a physical or
mental impairment so
DVR has 2 main
components 1
component being the disability
determination services
that is a component that does
all of the medical reviews for
social security
claims in New
Mexico and across the
nation we actually
share with several other states
through an online system
we also have the re
have services unit which
provides our direct vocational
rehab services
we provide pre
employment transition services
as Burnett talked about earlier
those are services for
students who are in high
school and getting ready to
transition out of
high school and we
are required to provide them
I our
services those
core services are job
exploration counseling
work based learning
experience counseling
on post secondary education
instruction on self
advocacy and workplace
readiness training and
so we get and all of the high
schools we do find
a statewide service
through our internal staff
and then we also have several
contracts that cover
statewide to get
into those high schools
charter schools public
schools private schools were
required to work with any
student that has a
504 or I. E.
P. and provide
them those services.
They are not required to be
a participant of
vocational we have to receive
those services those services
come as just part of
our 15 percent
allotment of our federal
grant
we also provide services
to adults and this is where
we can really help
employers
if an employee has a
disability visible
non visible and
they can come to us and we can
help them we can help them
with the reasonable accommodation
process we
can help them with additional
training we can help
them with job coaching
we can provide any service
that they need to maintain that
employment or advance in their
employment we can also
assist people to gain
employment and that can
be anything that you
can think of
restoration
vocational guidance and
counseling training
job coaching interviewing
skills assistive
technology
and then we have just recently
added a third component
to our service right
which is businesses
so for those businesses
that need that help
learning about the 88
understanding the reasonable
accommodation process
having disability etiquette
training we will be
bringing out caseloads for
businesses just as we serve
participants the
businesses are not required
to hire our participants
as part of that agreement we
would love if we could build that
pipeline obviously we
send employers
you know previously vetted
qualified candidates for
positions but our
services will come free of
charge to businesses
to help them navigate the
80.
I'm really
employing people with disabilities
it promotes inclusion at the
versified your workplace
workplace it
gives people access to
wages and independence
it increases their ability
to thriving
communities
individuals that disabilities
are an untapped resource
they're severely under
employed or
unemployed I
and so our goal at DVR is
obviously to expose as
many people as possible
and it doesn't matter that
disability we work with everything
from hearing impairment
to significant
developmental disabilities
to get them jobs and
we also work with employers
to look at their unique needs
so we do assessments
and see what are the lacking
whether the need we it's
not one size fits
all
I and and I'll stop with that
and let you know that we have a
flyer for businesses
that I handed out
and I'm always happy to answer
any questions about
any of our services at DVR
this is just our specific
employment fire
but also stopped there and stand
for any questions if you
all have any.
Any
questions.
Okay okay we'll get you on the
list Representative
Herndon
you know we in in
southern New Mexico we have an organization
called Tresco.
And
they do you
work in partnership
with them.
We do you know
we we find supported
employment services with
the for people
who have severe developmental
disabilities
I think everyone knows that all
legislative agencies took a
massive hit during
COVID employment
unfortunately has fallen by the
wayside so we are having
a very hard time finding
long term service
providers.
Sure it and you know it's
it's again we have
these like over
overlapping effects
of of different things
and I think it's in coming from
the business
sector.
You know I kind of I can can kind
of see both sides I don't necessarily
agree that
there shouldn't be accommodations
made I don't I don't I don't agree
that a business
shouldn't do
that.
Those double negative
businesses should be doing those
things
get my point I don't want to come
across as like
a horrible person
but I I think it's also that
businesses are looking at you know
what the costs are
and but I
I don't really see what the
argument is and that is like if you
need to to bring a standing
desk in for somebody because of
a particular disability or if you
need to print things out bigger
font which I think not
to dis disregard
the the disability that somebody
may be experiencing that needs bigger
font but as you get
older we're all needing bigger
font.
You know and so it's like you
know there are so many things
in the disability community
that makes sense for
the rest of us who don't have
disabilities
that it would just be
practical to have implemented
in the first place is just common
practice
and so I'm I'm wondering
though with those
businesses that need to
understand to
to make those modifications is
there if there is something with
some cost assigned
to it are there programs
available or
is there's a fib assistance
to help those
businesses because I think of that there are
some that are really kind of
working hard to keep the doors open and
they want to keep the people employed
and an extra expense
to make that modification that they may
have every intention of doing but it just
may financially not be feasible
madam chair members of the
committee the
average cost for
an accommodation is
$150
okay thank you for that
clarification
however yes
you know at DVR
obviously you know
we try to encourage
employers
to take on the
cost of the accommodation because
that is what they're required to
do but if it means the
difference between someone being
employed and someone not being
employed out we're
always happy to negotiate
and try to get to a place
that
is.
Agreeable and
affordable for the business
thank you for that I appreciate
that chair
also some tax credits
and federal tax credits
for
employers that provide
accommodations.
And if I may madam chair
there's also commission for the
blind Commission for deaf and
hard of hearing
that the DD Services
I mean there's a lot of supports
out there that that there's
also NM tap where people
can borrow equipment to make
sure that it's something that they need
because some of the stuff can be kind of
pricey
and so there's there's
options for that as
well so
I'm wondering if
there in
the pardon my ignorance if you've
already done this of reaching out
to local
chambers of commerce and I
run the green chamber of commerce Los
crucis and so
to have those resources
available like
you've got the one pager here
Casey is
I wonder if there's like you know
the more you know.
Of these of the resources available
for you to accommodate
up valuable employees who
may also happen to have
disabilities.
Madam chair members of the committee we
can always do a better job at
outreach you
know and that's and that's just a that's really
a suggestion I will get to the committee and
I know that there committee members want to ask
questions but I'm thinking
because I'm coming at this from a
perspective of somebody who
represents businesses is like
how can we
help them get the
information
and be able
to make it a little
bit less intimidating
for them because
you know it's
if they don't know that
there's support out there
then they're less
likely to be like really
energetic about yes
we've got these great people
I don't I don't know how to
make the work place
accommodate yes
Representative consumption
and ensuring committee
there's a there's also
the job accommodation network
and and as Casey
said you know
$150
average cost the
list every conceivable
disability on their website
and there's pages
of options and
ideas for accommodating
so any business
that you know of that is may be
facing some issues on how to
accommodate people
go to to job accommodation
network and
it is a great resource
and and really offers a
lot of of options
for committing people
is it too much to
ask that
if if because
you're knee
deep elbow deep in it that
you would be able to provide like a
listing that I can share with my
chamber colleagues in that we can
also share with this
committee
as kind of a list of resources
for businesses
and access for that is that
reasonable to ask I don't know I don't
want to throw more on your plate already
but I I do appreciate that because
I think it
is really
it on part one case you
say we can do a better job of the things
that were always all trying to get
to what's on our plate in the first
place and so
sometimes it's a little hard to
get to go to the
dessert plate
next when we're still not finished
with our main course.
So thank you for that we do
have Representative Garrett
Representative Lujan Representative
Matthews and Representative Herndon who
want to ask questions
so Representative Garrett you want to
go ahead and go first unless there's anything
else that you all want to cover before we
start going into questions
Representative care
thank you chairman helpless and
thank you for that presentation
my first as a minor point
is there in northern New Mexico
office as the
Albuquerque in Los
crucis.
And actually we no longer
have a Los crucis office we are
based out of Albuquerque
but we are statewide
so we have a toll free
number.
Thank you yeah and my
next question madam chair
is
Representative
Michael.
Sure.
That bettered.
Okay.
My interaction
Christine Chandler and myself
sponsored house bill 300
which would require the state
agencies to
consider hybrid
or remote working
a 20 cabinet secretaries
walked out and opposed
it although some of the
later said we don't oppose
it and I've learned that
one of the most successful agencies
amid New Mexico finance
authority actually is a hybrid
schedule
so.
Is there someone in
the state personnel
office
is there no ADA
coordinator.
When we
contacted
Matt Representative Garrett
madam chair of when we contacted
State
person they were
able to give us a policies
for their agency
and what they said was
for each agency
that called us a purse
of staff person
will call us we would have to find
out what their policy
was that they have the
freedom to make their own
policies regarding
reasonable
accommodation.
Chair committee I know
that a couple of the different
departments that I worked with
had an ADA coordinator
but I like your reference
to the main course versus
a desert
place.
The he really
didn't under one of them just
really didn't understand how the
ADA worked it was more like
okay we gotta have this so you're
signed to it so make it
work
and so I think that's one of the issues is
that maybe some departments and
and divisions have immediate
coordinator but they really are to
train ADA coordinator and they
don't understand how the process
works and so
then they end up
with telling people just
flat out no.
Representative Williams chairman
of the yes please
so I
was.
And a printer so I
was.
We have a state government and
it is the nature director
with training
you have to you have to go through the training
to the state to become an ADA
coordinator so I just want to really
I want to clarify that
and also
for the
88 th
Federal guidelines
8 in our state
and and working for state
we we actually have
something that we have
we're we're supposed to have certain
amount of ADA coordinators
throughout our state agencies
were not meeting those numbers
but we're not putting the numbers on many
other challenges we have in our work
force so I just want to just
clarify that a little bit thank
you.
I'm sorry
polities Casey wanted to
respond and members
of the committee governor's commission on
disability does have
a
ADA coordinator training
that is quite intensive that
requires a certain number of
hours of training
I did actually to see them
send out the notice recently
that that training is happening
again
but yes to your point
and and back in the
day the state also used to
have an 88 council
that for all the ADA
coordinators together I'm not
sure if that council still exists
but it's probably worth
exploring.
Madam chair thank you for the answer
I'm when we're on House
Appropriations we often have
certain questions we ask like
what's your with
that question we always ask
your rate of
people not fill a
vacancy rate I think I'm gonna add
this question and how do you
do your ADA
accommodations.
And yet thank
you madam chair and
and panel for both
your materials and your
comments that remind
us that there is an incredible
range of what's
a disability you can have a brilliant
worker and they need assistive
technology because
there's Lexus or
what ever or
when they made it
ADA bathrooms
in every bathroom other I didn't
see one down the hall.
You know you can take your stroller
in as well as your
wheelchair
and the final thing is I
agree with the
chairwoman
it's really it's always about
education and
communication
and sending us some
of the agencies will send a full
graphics that we can put on our
social media
you send it to us we slap
it on our Twitter or
Facebook or
letter because we just
can't hear enough
and remind people enough
to remind people that they have
the right to
have the right working
accommodation so thank
you very much and I'm gonna continue
to work on state
government having that
hybrid option
thank you.
Thank you Representative Garrett
Representative Lujan
thank thank you madam chair I really
do appreciate this.
Thanks
yes.
This conversation this
is really a huge
topic for me and and I and I
appreciate you madam chair for
bringing this for today it is part
of our on.
Our plan for the interim
session I think that
it's. We
have a lot
astigmatism.
With.
With our communities and our population
with disabilities
and I would just like to
to.
To highlight some of
the benefits of
of hiring folks with
disabilities and in
our.
And our workforce
so there was
a a
report in a research done
by act Accenture
eccentric believe is the name of it
of the industry
and they reported a 20
to 30 percent
higher of profit
margins for.
Companies or industries that participated
in focused on
engagement with
our a disability
communities I mean
that alone speaks to
what it means but we're
still looking at rates at
37 percent
of of workers
with disabilities as opposed to
77 percent of population
without disabilities so I
think a lot of the work
where this goes to
is
how are we collaborating
with
engagement
overall and that
goes to a transition
with our use
from school to work
force and
we talked earlier with apprenticeship
programs how are we engage
in I was saving this call questioning
for this panel how are
we engaging with the use
workforce with disabilities
and that transition
and you mentioned with the IEPs
I brought this up last are
yesterday that once
you get to high school or
even by the age of
14
students can
decline having an I
EP.
And so how are we tracking
that how are you tracking that
I mean that's it easy like you
can here's a list of kids
with IT peas but if
they no longer participate or
want those IDPs how
are we tracking them and then
how we tracking them when they're
going
into.
A higher education
and what is that workforce
training and tracking and
then when they come out
how are we helping them
assess
their on
their needs and in the
workforce in
those.
Those reasonable accommodations
that they are going to need in
entering the work force
so these are the some of the things that
I am very interested
in obviously some of things are
working on but I think it's a
collaboration and I'm glad that
madam chair and that
you brought up the the governor's
commission on disability
as well because
we need to we
need to fast track this a little bit
better we need to do do a little
more facilitative work
and working at and
policy wise if we need
to one of the models
that I have found is working
and.
In this round is is out
of New York City and I think I brought this
up yesterday and I'd like to
if any of you know about that I
think I'd like to
have a further discussion on that
even outside of this
the of today's panel
but how are we
then that goes into you know
workforce and local government how we
all collaborated with his what
does that look like.
Madam chair members of the committee
we have
memorandums of understanding
with several state agencies number
one we said under the public education
department
let me just tip my toe in this
and say that there been a couple of
movements to move DVR out
from under education
over the last few years
at it makes more sense
than ever for us to be under
education because we have that
direct pipeline to students
so we have an MO you
directly with the special ed division
at PED and we work with them very
closely we
also have an MO you with
workforce solutions
out one of the things that we
are working on
improving is our collaboration
with other agencies
we work with the DST which
is a developmental disability
supports division
and we have
we have a really close actually
relationship with governor's
commission
I know stand really well
him and I actually became
directors right around the same time
so
would you know I'm happy to
partner with anyone I'm happy to
speak with anyone I think
that we
again to the point
of you know getting the word out in
collaboration we can always
do a better job and we're happy
to collaborated
to move those students from high school
all the way through
career and then just
so you all know once they get to
career we don't just close the
case we follow them for a
minimum of 90 days
to ensure that their stable and that
employment and if it's 120
days or it's you know
longer than that we will
continue to be there and if they
ever require services
again they can come back
to the R. will reopen the case
immediately and get them whatever
it is that they need.
Thank you measures basically
my question is as follows
where the gaps
where are we not doing
and I know we need more ADA
coordinators that's very clear
our state is really lacking
in the numbers that we have
but you know this this feels
off into the private
sector working with employers
and really developing
those those relationships and
an understanding as to
to get away from the stigmas
and to let them know that Hey
you can you can be more
profitable you could
have these are the these are the
Bryans and and
and what we need to hire and really
focus and engage
and share.
I'm
actually.
There are many
gaps.
Where do I start
there is a lack of
accessible transportation
if you can't get to work because
you don't have transportation you can't
work
affordable accessible
housing
those are all issues that
affect people with
disabilities and
that's why a lot of people with
disabilities are still living in
poverty.
And I would add mentor to
it's been one else has anything to the
wages right and fair
wages and you know we
we were in this place where
we're.
There's misconceptions out there
I mean for me overall that
that there are a lot of discipline to get
on to the waiver
you know you're you're having these benefits
to handle these things but then you
want me part of the workforce in your
there's an inhibition
and there are there are some of those
are there are gaps there is well
I don't know if you can speak to that but I
think that we don't even
give fair wages
and it's it's a huge
injustice I think
check.
Madam chair members of the committee
I am during
my time away from DVR actually
worked in employment community
inclusion for the DD
waiver and
was you know really trying to
push the employment first
movie we have
several states across the nation
that are employment for states
and what that means is that employment
as the first option for somebody who
is on a waiver
we don't offer day service
first we don't offer you
know that in home care we
always offer them the option to
try implement first it's
been a long
road in New
Mexico I think there is
a cultural shift
that needs to happen these
are my personal opinions
when it comes to employment
because people are
very scared
to lose benefits but the
truth of the matter is
they've gotta be making quite a bit
of money to lose benefits and at the
end of the day they will
make more money if they work
even if they you know
have a lowered
amount of benefits
we do have benefits advisors
within DVR
who can help people
figure out what it looks like dollar
for dollar how they're going to come out
at the end of the month They report those
wages
so I think employment
first is is a really
important thing at if
if New Mexico could
officially become an employment for
state that's of what a lot of
other states have done across
the nation and really
just push that narrative
of getting people to
work.
For any population that
just has a barrier
it doesn't have to be a disability
it could be you know lack
of work experience it could
be stay at
home moms that have never been in
the work force whatever that barrier
is employment first
but I can chime in on
this is that
you know I mean first and foremost we're talking
about human
beings
and but and so I don't
don't want to disregard that
but when we look at
the return
on investment.
What we're doing
is we're spending
less on services
that are needed to
support the
disabilities that
are existing when
we are helping people become
independent
of self
self sustaining and
so it's and
I hate making the economic argument
because we are talking about
people ultimately
but I think it's when we
make that economic argument
and show that the return
on investment is higher when we
actually employ people
and make those accommodations
rather than have to
have these individuals dependent
on.
Services that are
supported by the
government
you know it's it's it's kind of like
for us it's like we're scratching our head like
that's a no brainer
like why are we not doing this I know you're
like yeah easy for you to
say I have to deal with it every day
but I really would
like to have that the the a further
conversation about becoming an
employment first and
see what we can do on that so I'm
sorry Representative.
Thank you madam chair I think this is
the conversation this is engagement
of us having a real conversation
here and are you
know the reason why we
we bring for bringing this up is
because we're lacking in
our workforce.
Right we don't have one we
can't hire everywhere move
if you want to just talk about the
state and employment
and we're we're deficient
but it's it's in every
sector so
can you tell me into we have
numbers of employees
employment in New Mexico over
those with disabilities
contract.
Madam chair members of the committee
our employment rate
for individuals who come
not overall in the state but
for individuals that come through
DVR right now is about 41
percent
of the people that come through the
door find
employment
and and that's for several
different reasons because there they
may be moving through the system so
it's a constant
movement of people through
the system and then the
other thing that I wanted to tell you
madam chair and and
and Representative Lujan
is DVR does not support
7 among wage
jobs we only support
competitive integrated
employment.
Thank you for that distinction percent
for saying that that that is really
important and no
just getting to the the solutions
this is why we're having these
conversations
so and correct me
if I'm wrong what is our population
of participate if those that are
eligible to work right
now.
Madam chair.
Madam chair and Representative
Lujan I don't have that exact
number.
I was told by so and I just want to
double check is
500000
on individuals in
our state.
That are out I'm not sure if it their
eligibility but I wanted to get
some clarification maybe we can work
offline on those numbers and really
understand this
really kind of tap into
this workforce that is
under it's not
being addressed
and it's under
represented you know there
are a lot of issues around this
and I think one thing that we're afraid
of our
I mean there's a lot of factors but the
culture shift is really
where we have to get to the bottom of
things and I think really changing
the messaging to really get engaging
with employers and was
it with the private sector as
well with the public sector to in
here the reason why we need to do this
really understanding what it
means from an
HR perspective to on
those laws in those legalities
of what are reasonable
accommodations
what does that look like how does that
improve
workforce how does
the culture in a workplace
that does bring
in
workforce with
of.
With the disabled
actually improve the culture
of of those
those the
industry that they work for
so there's a lot to it
is so much to discuss
I would like to settle in on
on meeting up to getting some of
those numbers really further in this
conversation and I do
know I talked with with
our chairman of the LFC
with senator Munoz
about this too it's it's really
something we're not really tapping
into we really need to
thank you madam chair and
also I don't know on our
youth and I know
and I I agree with you having DVR
under PED I once
question do now I'm like well this
is actually an opportunity
and why it's really important that
we are under PED
because this is a
workforce that we're not tapping into
we're not even considering to the
highest degree that we need to thank
you madam chair.
Thank you did you want to I don't
think one respond.
I was just going to add to
I think one of the one of the
gaps or at
least something that contributes to the
problems is is a
lack of understanding and
knowledge about
people with disabilities and I
think that the more that we
get out there and talk about
it and normalize
it for
lack of a better word
I think the
better things will get
in and that's a big call
because it's it's
it's a lot of work and I
know it dear NM we do
trainings all the time about
disability awareness
I am always happy to get out and
do that and I would say right now
anybody has anyone they would
like to have training time and hit I
think we're happy to accommodate
that just in the
in the overall effort to get the
word out there
and speaking as someone who
did go through commission
for the blind and did
an on the job training with
a burning Chavis and with
with disability rights New Mexico
I'm sitting here
today.
As proof that it does work
well certainly the stigmatizing and
because the thing is is that you
know we all know
somebody at least
one person who also
happens to have a disability
Representative Matthews in the Representative
Herndon you'll finishes off
unless anybody else wants us
questions.
Thank you madam chair and
thank you offered
presentation
when I was a young lawyer I
represented a class of the
section kids
I had to obtain under
504 section
54 better special
ed education service
better public education
services
which is I think when I meant
Jim Jackson for the first
time which is
about 112 years
ago I
think.
He's he's aged
better than I
have.
It is
so.
So at some point
when the stores re opened after
COVID I was in
target and
one of the.
So the the clerks
in the in the where
the TV's are and all of
that
up
who is working there was in a
wheelchair.
And I remember thinking
at the time.
Because it was so unusual to
see
a clerk
a sales person
in a wheelchair and I ate
large store like that
I and I it made me think
about whether or not because of
COVID and a lack of workforce
and so forth that was happening
or happened in net
in as a result of
that
has there been to your
knowledge any
increase in the number
of
individuals with disabilities
who have been able
to it has a
number go on
up.
In terms of employment
in essentially the
private sector
and that
jobs or has
it stayed the same or go
down.
Madam chair members of the
committee.
I would love to say
yes but the red that you answer
is now at and
we you know we still
have a lot of work to do to
get up
additional people implied we know
that we have a low workforce
participation rate
for individuals with
disabilities
we know specifically
at DVR that our numbers
over the COVID dropped about
50 percent for referrals
because people were scared you know
if you have a pre existing condition
are
there were a lot of disabilities
that. Would make
COVID we're so we're seeing those
numbers slightly increase
I do think that employers
are being
more receptive to hiring
people with disabilities
and they're not as fearful
when they see someone
coming
to the door so I it's a
positive movement.
Okay I'm sure thank
you
your Casey right.
Yes okay.
And thank
you.
On the question of hybrid
of work as being
a reasonable accommodation
do you know
whether or not there has been
any case
law or
regulations at the federal
level that has clarified
that.
Madam chair and
Representative Matthews I
do not know the
answer
there is the
ADA center out
of Houston that provides
through the clearing house for all of this
information we could
certainly check with
them in New Mexico
there's nothing.
And I do know that I mean if if
there are things that come to we've
had this where there have
been kind of light bulb moments the
middle of the night when you can't sleep
that you want to like a like a
provided this to the committee you can go
ahead and send that information to
Erin and she will send
it to the rest of us
okay and just because there might be
some things that Representative
Matthews is talking about that the rest
of us would want us to go through
Aaron and intial
disseminated
well.
Thank you madam chair I
can.
It could.
The.
I'm sorry it out
okay
when you when you said there is
no one agency in the state
of New Mexico that
is responsible for 88
coordination did I hear that
right.
You said that's exactly
what we were told by state
person okay
so.
If a if a legislator
was to
introduce a bill that
would for example can you
tell me whether or not this is the right
agency.
This part about
the TVA
TVA my getting the initials
right. DVC
DVR DVR
on I know I the
sophomore.
That DV are
it should be
the agency in charge
of 88 coordination
and with that came some
money
would that be something you would support
or would it be better if
it the like that was introduced in
the with a different
agency
designated.
Madam chair members of the committee
DVR is actually mostly
federally funded with very little
state general fund
yes and so I think that
if you want.
It would probably set better
any fully state
funded position that would have
more authority over that
position
and madam chair Casey
could you suggest what that
agency might
be.
Madam chair members of the committee I
cannot.
You are not allowed to or is
that.
No yes I think
that madam
chair and members of the committee I think that
it would.
It would be worth looking at
where the greatest impact would be
for that position and I
think that's really where the
Representative is going is like
how can we how
can we remove those challenges in those
roadblocks 40
ultimately because there is a
recognized need
that we are not
doing enough
to help you do what you need
to do that will eventually
trickle down into our workforce
and actually helping people become
sustainable as I stated
in my right that's where you're going
Representative and then tear
you are are our
idea of money per
year
yes this is a problem
it seems to me that we
can make great
progress on but
we would need input
I would certainly if I response you
need input
from
it.
People like
yourselves and Alan
and and Jim and so
forth as to
what that state agencies
should be and what kind
of additional
risk
tortoises they they might
need and also
some estimates maybe of
cost of what
additional money
but that is something that I
certainly would be willing to work
on and I think that
there would be others
also
who would be willing to work on
that.
It I hope that clarifies where
I was going I think that
yes Representative I think so
and I think there's you're noticing
that there some folks were really eager about
that and the thing that I would
like to encourage you is
that I feel that this
is something that is uniquely New Mexico
is that our legislators
are are approachable for the most
part and when
there's this offer of this invitation
take it.
Take it and run with it
madam chair thank you very much I
appreciate that a
couple along the same
lines
there are you mentioned federal
tax credits for
hiring
disabled individuals
individuals with disabilities I'm
sorry
and it seems to me that
perhaps one thing
I took from that statement
that there were no state
tax credits and again
that would be something
that could certainly
be looked at by
state
legislators.
And then a couple
other things I'd like
to follow up
on.
Does the.
Does the attorney general's
office the state
attorney general's office
provide legal
services
to.
To any of the state agencies
that are charged with
providing services
to
individuals with disabilities
particularly employment types of
services.
And if not does anybody
find this in the
state are
there any state any
state lawyers that are
helping you
all.
I guess I'm
not sure about the internet
general's office but
disability rights New
Mexico provides
legal services for people
with disabilities that are
having difficulty
with employment
under ATA
and so I don't
know maybe
Jim would answer that question I
don't know what other
state agency there are no
state agencies that I know
of of I
mean they can file a human
rights claim
Representative but but
they don't advocate
for them.
Well I'm thank you
and madam chair I
I just think this is an area
that is ripe for all
kinds of interesting
bills for progress
and progress
right
and.
I quite
frankly
I think that there should be a
role for state attorney general's
office involved
with
this.
And let's see if I had anything
else to raise hell
about here for
second.
You.
Yes my madam chair
my my last question would
be is
what would be the
best way to
start to coordinate
and put together
sort of a
list at least
where we should be
making changes in
state law
or adding to state
law or designating agencies
or whatever it is that needs to
be
done.
Madam chair members the committee
very quickly we are just in
the beginning stages of
developing our state plan for
the workforce innovation and
opportunity act
for the next 3 year term
and that is a federal
mandate for several agencies
to partner together that does
include DVR
workforce
solutions.
Commission commission for the
blind
Human Services
Division
developmental disabilities
council I
think that would be an excellent
venue to to begin having
this conversation and I I didn't
get all the partners but there are
several state agency
partners and exactly
what we're doing is looking at
how do we coordinate
the efforts for workforce
for all of workforce in New Mexico
but including individuals
with disabilities for the next
3 years and whether those services
look like and in fact
DVRs
just about to
embark upon a comprehensive
statewide needs assessments
to look at how we're serving the
state and and where we need
to put our resources and our
efforts so I'd be happy to
share that information when
it wraps up in
the new calendar year
that the great the great
I think there's certainly go ahead
Representative yeah I just wanted to
say thank you very much for that for
that and I see no reason why
this should move forward as
a priority
project
it's been it's been on the
back burner too long.
That leads me to remind it
will finish off today with Representative
Herndon but
air is going to be sending out a
reminder that if there's any
legislation that this committee
wants this committee to
either endorse or support
the deadline to submit that so
that the committee can review
it is by
the end of our September
meeting so
I know that there are starting because
we for some reason we don't have meetings
in November this time around even though
we do have the same amount of
meetings. Please
start thinking about
that if there
is legislation and
will send out that reminder but
it needs to be submitted to Erin
by the end of our September
meeting that day
and then we will have the
following up until
our last meeting in
October in Santa Fe
to decide whether or not we endorse
this as a committee and move
forward to that.
Representative Herndon
you are the last question of the
day madam thank you
madam chair and madam
chair presenters
I I raise my first
question
regarding children because
of the statement that you made
and there is has come to my
attention of a family
whose child was in an
accident and is
in the hospital will probably
be there for
a length of time
and so is that a
type of situation
in terms of a disability
you will help those those
parents with in terms
of coordinating
work at
and work schedules
are are what is it that you
might do to help
madam chair and
Representative Herndon are you
asking for the child
or for the parents well I'm
asking first for the parents
and then I have a special question
about the tile K.
so in order to be
eligible for vocational rehab
services it's an end
of what individualized
eligibility process where
the person must
have
a physical or mental disability
to qualify for the
services.
So the parent would
need to have a
disability as
a child not taking care of
the child now
okay. Right
in the second question regarding
the child is the
child getting schooling
and there's been a lot of questions
about that child now being
left out of the type
of schooling that
she should be receiving
and how do you help
arrange that so the child
doesn't fall behind it
wasn't their fault they want an
accident. Madam
chair and representative and
and I would recommend
contacting the special
ed
Division directly for public
education so
that they can
provide those
resources to that
family the
developmental disabilities
council also has
a special but
her name is Michelle
trying to
gamble.
If you go to the developmental
disabilities council
website you should
be able to find
her information and
I I believe there also
on social media there on
Facebook she has a page on
Facebook as well.
And that would be an excellent resource
to help with that advocacy
and. Hi
number 17
madam chair
Representative Herndon
disability rights New Mexico
can find some resources
to this family we also
provide legal
advocacy for
children who may need
special education there may
need to be an evaluation
process to see what this
child needs and we will
make sure that school does
that to provide
appropriate
services.
Thank you and then my
final question was something that
you waves Grace regarding
transportation
and and disability
are disadvantaged in
getting to work
so if I
I A. F. person
who lives on the west side
of town the
transportation
system is not nearly as
robust as it should be
and so trying to get from there to
the interior are to the east
side fort
work has been very
challenging so my question
is that something that you all
work with and then
so. What
do you do.
Cap. Madam
chair members of the committee we've
worked with the City of Albuquerque
several times to to provide
training City of
Albuquerque transportation
division it is experiencing
the same struggles we all are
with turnover and retention
I believe they just creep that
got a new transportation
director the public
transportation is inconsistent
son Venice and
consistent we can
provide assistance with
mileage reimbursement
costs we
to assist with that and
modifications we cannot purchase
event but we can assess the
modifications to the
vehicle I should
just say event a car as well
if it's like a you know a ramp
or something like that.
Pretty much anything that you can think
of that we can provide to help
somebody get to work
now you know with the
vouchers.
They're not accessible
vehicles available
there are some in larger cities
it's not been
a big following
in New Mexico at
some private companies have
opened up and we've actually
thrown some ideas back and forth through
a couple of agencies
to try to maybe and
just need a small business
to help somebody start just for self
employment venture to
have accessible vehicles but
transportation is a huge
issue we try to be
creative as creative as we
can be we even do just
neighborhood counseling to
see is there something
in that neighborhood that would
help somebody get to work so
that they didn't have to go so
far and we do also
provide relocation costs
if it's
justified.
Madam chair and and
if I may add to this and I
can't remember your name I'm
sorry
Herndon
I.
Yeah well
I I think that it's not
just the transportation but one of
the other issues that we see is
the infrastructure
for instance if you were to take the
the bus
get a job downtown Santa
Fe and you take the bus
to where the bus ends and
drops people off downtown Santa
Fe the
sidewalks
are not accessible I
mean if you were in a wheelchair
you really would have
to be in the street to get
to certain businesses and even
some of those businesses aren't even
accessible you can get into
them and that's
not just Santa Fe that's
everywhere so
I think that that it it
would be remiss
of us not to also
look at the fact that a lot of the
infrastructure needs to be
addressed
for
accessibility.
Thank you madam chair thank
you presenters
thank you Representative
Herndon and thank you for the questions
if there's anything else I would recommend
like going ahead and taking that off line
Representative Lujan I know you had a couple of
other questions but I do think
that if
you know the resources I mean
obviously this committee is viewing you
as this this
bottomless pit of resources
and and information
and we appreciate that and I
think it's it's incredibly
important for us to
be informed and I think based
on the questions you saw that there
there are some folks who are really
interested in being able to
help you out
and I and I do hope that you take
that take advantage of
that and and that
invitation is a
genuine and
sincere
and and so I look forward to this
different conversations and and
ways that we as a committee and
we as a legislature
that are representing the people of the
state which also includes people
with disabilities
that they have access to employment
and long term care
and of being able
to live quality of life that
everybody deserves and that's a New Mexico
value so I I hope that
we are able to do that so
thank you ladies for being here today
