I got way too much stuff appear
modest all right we're going to
go ahead and members were
a.
Reconvening after a very
quick lunch so
it is
134 we
reconvene this is the Economic
Development real policy
committee.
I'm senator Kerry and one as the
chair very excited
about the folks who are here
today we
were joined within
the last 5 minutes by
Senator Nancy Rodriguez
some very happy that she
came to our rescue flying
in and her
super woman
sued
I'll create all those images and
really good about that one
and very grateful we
are now going to start
talking about just to
let you know that we are operating at
a subcommittee we are not at
the committee level we do not have a
quorum.
We do have 2 sets
of equipment that we do need to
vote on so we're going to
push for that quorum for Friday
morning
and Aaron and staff will
be calling folks but if
there are folks here who are voting
members of this
committee.
The day that we absolutely need
you as much as Friday
morning.
All representative Armstrong the not
gonna be there.
I need you to support me in my my
legislation
Representative.
I catastrophic business
business loan
fund.
So we'll play
player if we have a quorum
tomorrow I'll take that
opportunity to do it
tomorrow
but we'll do our best so
I just want to give the committee
a heads up as to what we have
left to do
I do appreciate the conversations
in just a commitment from this
committee on
what we need to do to move
forward we do have
a busy afternoon we
are about 35
minutes behind schedule
so thank you.
To all of you who are here to
speak I'm really grateful
I do try to move this forward
quickly but we do
have coming up
next an update from the New Mexico
bioscience Authority then after
that
Senator Ortiz he Pino is
very excited about geothermal
energy and he will be presenting
along with that group
and then Jim
to dart and from
renewable energy industry
for distributed energy
resources and
then for conversation
about economic development house
if we have public comment will have that
otherwise we will recess for the
evening tomorrow
we reconvene in Los Alamos
so Stephanie Paul I'm gonna go
ahead and let you do
your stuff
thank you for being here today we
appreciate you coming up to tell
us and the so go
ahead and and I'll let
you if you don't
mind us eating while you're speaking
I promise the microphones will be on
4
okay.
You hear me OK
thank you so much madam chairman
for inviting us to
speak
today.
Cassia all
rights I'd
give myself echoing
all right my name is Stephanie to
Fiji and executive director of the New
Mexico biocides Authority
this is one of
our board members
Paul lord.
And we're going to talk
about the overview
of an
update of what the Bisons
Authority has been working on for the
last here
as well as an overview
of our funding request
that we will be making
legislation this
coming session.
Of a lot of the information
that we've included in this package
is updates
it's you know it's
things that many of you have already
seen and so we'll go through it a little
bit faster
coming into our initiatives
so of first
just a reminder biosciences
is a federal and state
priority
it can diversify the
economy it can
create a green
supply chain to be able
to help with getting
drugs from market
to consumers
and it also provides growing
and.
It has a really great upward
trajectory when it comes to the
market it's
predicted to reach 1.25
$7000000000000
which I know that you guys were talking to cannabis
earlier today and
they are also on a really
great check 3
biosciences is is
also on that
it comes from a lot of the
health care but also from the
biotech as well as
on national security
so we're really excited to be part of
that and to be able to help you
Mexico played a major
role that they can
play.
We've identified that 3
of the 9 economic
development clusters that have been
identified by the
Economic Development Department
do fall under the biosciences
so it's not just
biosciences by themselves
but it's also sustainable and
value added ag
and renewable and green
energy
Apollo or is an expert
in the in the renewable and
green energy peace and so we were able
to bring that
into our by a science
understanding when he joined
our board so we're really excited about
that.
Other number of federal
initiatives I'll talk
a little bit going
forward about one of the
initiatives that we've been able
to take advantage
of which was the
small business administration
growth accelerator fund
competition
we were able to
write a proposal to that
program using bio
sciences as one of the
federal initiatives that
we've been prioritized
and we were able to get
to
prices for that so stage
one and stage 2 prize that
we're we've been able to
use to create the New Mexico
rural biotech
ecosystem so I'll
talk more about that a little bit
later.
But what is biosciences
we include a
large breadth
of different
pieces of the industry
but the I mean components
are agricultural
sciences that include feedstock
and chemicals
bioscience related
distribution
drugs and pharmaceuticals medical
devices and equipment
and then research bioinformatics
testing in medical
laboratories.
We make sure again to
include a lot of the pieces that
may not be readily
included in those
one of my favorite examples is
open I scientific
they're actually a software company
that's based out of Santa
Fe. But
their whole
trajectory is molecular
modeling and so they are
included in biosciences
because of that piece
and so we like to include as
many
businesses as we possibly
can that relate
to the biosciences and
are included in the
biosciences.
So why are by a sciences in
New Mexico
one great weather to
beautiful landscapes 3 wonderful
people of for
its because
biosciences
is being 7 it
is being
read only
worked on in the national
labs as well as in the research
universities and so we've been able
to see that we have a lot of
bioscience innovation that's coming
out of the state of New Mexico
per capita we probably
has you know
well we're seventh in the nation
actually per capita for the
amount of bioscience patents
that are coming out
we have so many
creative innovative
people that are here
that are creating the innovation
that is being patented
but not necessarily
commercialized and so
that's one of the things that we're working on
being able to
identify to be able
to help
move technology out
of the research universities national
labs into the
commercialization and then to be
able to help those companies
to take root and to
develop with in the
state. So
there are a lot of things
that are showing that New Mexico is
bioscience ready
just like I said the universities and
national labs are
you know doling out the research
they're creating the
patents we
have a lot of work force that is
being
educated within our
research universities
as well as in
other universities like Navajo
tech
in San Juan college both of those
have got really strong
bioscience
opportunities to be able to
learn and so we want
to take advantage of all of these people
that are getting educated
in the sciences but we want to be
able to place them in jobs
in the state
we have existing companies and
entrepreneurs we have some
venture capital
we recently learned
I mean tramway ventures is one of
those that is working
on specifically
supporting biosciences
through the S. A. C. funding
so we're really excited to be able to see
that and we want to be able to
contribute more
to that of a
creates high paying green
jobs and
one thing that we really need
everybody to keep in mind is
that it supports the creation
of more jobs and
so for everyone job
biosciences that is created
research has been able to show that for
jobs are created in
addition to that in terms
of the supply chain or in terms
of the director jobs that
are created.
Slide induced employees
spending.
A New Mexico has got by a
same companies throughout the state
we've been able to see that there are
companies in every
county except
for more County into Baca
County one
piece that we're really working on
for the rural biotech
ecosystem is to be able
to market
those rural communities
better to be able to
attract bioscience companies
to move their
we've been able to
see successes
in other states
and we're really excited to be able
to help support the
connectivity of
the entire states resources
to be able to really
advance you know
those rural communities to
attract those bioscience
companies.
For them to be able to set.
Why buy a sense is a good
industry to grow in New
Mexico we've been able
to show a lot of statistics
that show that you know
it is
you very valuable
it's a high paying job
it is a sustainable
job it
is one that the state of New
Mexico is educating
a lot of people to
be able to work in that
industry the
universities are getting a
lot of funding to be able to
support the research and innovation
that they are continuing to
advance on
the bioscience is leading
New Mexico patents
this is something that one of our board
members Christus Christopher
Christodoulou who is
also leading
aerospace he
likes to contend
you know that aerospace
and and bio sciences
are you know
combating each other when it comes to the
patents but biosciences
will we'll reach out with
that. Some
things that we've been able to see
that are a problem
though is that 70
percent of the students that are
graduating from New Mexico
universities with bio science
related degrees are then
leaving the state because they're
not finding jobs
we've identified that actually
that may not be because the jobs
are not there but maybe there's
not enough marketing to
help those bioscience
companies to be visible
to the people that that that are
looking for the jobs
and this is a problem that we've
seen nationwide
it seems to be a thing with biotech
companies
you know that they're that they're not
necessarily I'm really good
at marketing themselves when it comes
to employees so that that's one of
the things that we try to
help out with we
repost every job
posting that we see
for biotech companies so that
we can be able to get the word out
a little bit better.
And also the employee index
increase
is.
Expected to be higher for
bioscience related jobs than
it is for any other private
sector one of the
reasons for that is because
of aging on
health and
because of the supply chain
issues that were evident during
COVID we need
to be able to keep those kinds of
industry within the
state country to
be able to reduce the prices to
be able to reduce the
lack of availability
to be able to help everybody stay
healthy and
moving
forward.
New Mexico has been able to show
a lot of commercialization of
their bioscience industry
but again we know that there needs
to be more and especially
because the University of New Mexico
seems to be the
best
advocate for their
own
companies to be able to
grow that is the data
that we have we
have board members that are from New
Mexico state and from New Mexico
tech we've
asked both
of those universities
to provide this type
of information as
well.
University of New Mexico is a lot better
at keeping track of that stuff so that's
why we have this information
but we are aware of
you know the difference companies
that are coming out of the other research
universities and we're really excited to
be able to see them
we've identified that New Mexico
is very skilled at creating
start up companies
one of the pieces that the bioscience
Authority is working to do is
to help those start up
companies to
become developed
companies and the state
of New Mexico
companies.
So I kind of
have touched on a lot of the reasons
why The New Mexico
bioscience Authority
but just going into the details of
it I believe
that this committee knows
all about the grow by a report
it was a public private partnership
that was done back in
2016
to help identify industry
that could help they for syfy the economy
away from strictly
being oil and gas and travel and
tourism and
the biosciences was identified
as being a key
industry that could help with
that and so in
2017
the bioscience
authority was created
by a SB
478.
I'm going to the next page
we can see the history of the
bioscience Authority
included that it was
identified as a center of
excellence in 2019
and then in 2022
we were able to have our
first pilot co investment
program.
Rector policy director Lawrence
going to talk more about the Mexico investment
program in a little bit
but that was the first time where we were
able to take the pilot funding
that we have been saving
up through administrative
costs to be able to
then invest in
a bioscience company
with one of our partners
New Mexico angels
and so then you by was
the company that we invested
in last year we're
really excited for this
upcoming
October board meeting when
president drew Tolchin
from the New Mexico angels
and CEO John
o'rourke from thank you bye
are going to come and present
to our board so that we can
see you know what is been happening
with that
at the legislative
session
see your work was able
to testify and he was able
to say that that
funding at that time it
was Bridge funding was
able to
retain the staff
that they needed to be
able to then go forward
and get their first on
commercial customer
and so we're really excited to be able
to see you know that are
funding made a difference
in you know what they were able to
do.
Of the bioscience on mission
and vision
is lengthy but
in summary it's
working to grow more robust
bioscience industry throughout the
entire state
and so that's what we're working on being
able to do it's able
to connect all of the
different stakeholders that are
involved including
the researchers
that innovators the
entrepreneurs the investors
as well as the government
agents that are going to be making
those decisions
like this wonderful
committee.
We have many activities
that are granted
to us by statute by
on Senate bill for 78 for
2017
advising state leadership creating
programs promoting
legislation our co
investment program is part of
that legislation and then
actively recruiting bioscience
businesses to New
Mexico.
Of the organization of the
New Mexico bioscience Authority
we are 13 person
board right now
we have 11 members
we are waiting for
one number to be appointed
by the legislation and
another member to be
appointed by the governor
hopefully that will happen soon
so that we will have our
13 member
board.
But we are also
administratively attached State
University of New Mexico so
I am an employee of the
university of New Mexico but 100
percent of my efforts are
put onto the bioscience
Authority
even though we are administrative
Lee attached our
agenda and our priorities
are set by our board which
again is made up of representatives
from across the state
and so me
I see myself as being
a an advocate of
the state not just an
employee of the university but
the university does help
to provide us
with administrative
support
financial oversight
auditing and procurement
support so we are able to
use their
facilities and their support to
be able to make sure that whatever we are
doing is in line with the
state priorities and
the university
guidelines
this print
print out actually I was able to take
advantage of that administrative
attachments because our
printer broke and I
needed to get printed so I went to the
university and I was able to
get a printed there so's very
helpful.
Next is a lovely
picture of our board
members right now we have
2 members from the university of New
Mexico 2 members
from New Mexico state
one member from New Mexico
tech the secretary
of economic development department
or their designees
which is more a second.
The executive director of spaceport
authority or their designees which
is Francisco Clarice
4 members appointed by the speaker
of the house and Senate pro
tem and 2 members
appointed by
the.
I'm going forward is
a picture of our staff
we're really excited that we have a
new staff member on this
year
and we're on
a Schmitt alleviate is
with us today and
she is an I. T. and
internet intellectual property
specialist
that is going to be able to
work with the
biocides Authority to be able
to support the needs of the
bioscience companies throughout the
state so we're really excited
about that she has a lot of
great.
Background she's she's got an amazing
background in business development
and she has a lot of great ideas for
being able to educate
businesses to be able to
move from
idea to
start up to be able to move forward
so we're really excited to bring her
in especially
along with the.
Rural economic biotech
the rural biotech
ecosystem that were we're
developing.
Going on to our current
initiatives.
We have the community readiness
program that was our
first
program that was created
by the bioscience Authority
that has been going strong
since our creation and
2017
we use
that program
to be able to attract bioscience
companies and start ups to
locations that have been
identified as being bioscience
ready
it helps to foster bioscience
industry growth
it really helps to be
able to identify
that communities are
excited about bringing bioscience
companies and
bioscience companies take
awhile to develop
and just be able to know that they
have the support
of the community that there
there is a really big incentive
for those companies
but it also helps
the
I industry to be I mean the
the communities to be able to market
themselves better as well to
be able to say like hate we're excited
to have you
we have certified sites in
Albuquerque Rio Rancho
Santa Fe and Los crucis right
now.
And we're working
on.
Los Lunas Santa Ana pueblo in
Clovis or working on their certification
process and then
we're on in
discussions right now with Los
Alamos accorhotels
scalloped all pods
0 in Roswell
so that they can also
join you know what
we're all working on
we use the community
readiness
sites to
be able to market to the
rest of the country
New World actually we go
to the bio international
conference convention
every year
last year it was in Boston this
coming year it's going to be in San
Diego and we're able
to say you know like Hey
we have all of these places
that are ready to accept bioscience
companies and look we
have companies that are here with
companies that are there and so we're
really working on being able to
develop a hub to be
able to attract those companies
because we realize that the state of New
Mexico is vast
it is a large large state
in area but
is not very big in
population and so being
able to have something that is
reproducible in
these different locations throughout
the state is really
valuable for
companies to be able to move
around within the
state if they need to but also
to provide resources when
they need it wherever they're at
in the state those
are the priorities
of the community reading this
program.
Another effort that we
really our
incentive are working
on is the centralization of
state resources we
do that through both
collecting and collating
but also through I'm
sharing through our list serve
through our social
media through our website
different pieces like that
one piece that I'm really excited
about for the rural
biotech ecosystem is that
we're going to be able to partner with
economic technologies to
be able to build a
comprehensive eco
map platform that
is going to bring
together all of the resources
it's going to identify the resources
that are
important to bioscience
companies as well
as all of the bioscience companies
themselves different
events they're happening throughout the
area as well as
opportunities for funding
and jobs
so these are the things that were really working
on doing so that's going to be a big
piece of that
centralization.
And I keep talking about it but
the next program that is
our newest program is
the bioscience business accelerator
program it started
initially just
looking at wanting to help
with SBIRS TTR
requests in connection
with the New Mexico fast
program and the U.
N. M. lead on
excel program
that was funded by the NIH
it has developed beyond
that so now we're really
working on
supporting companies
in whatever capacity
they need and so it may be
in grant development it could
be in partnership development
it could be in
building up their advisory
board and so we've been able
to connect the
different companies that
images are are listed right
now to be able to
help them with their
development as they go along
and so that could
you know I that includes a lot of different
components including grant
training mentoring
workshops network
facilitation
just to support those companies to
grow and then
again on that flight I also
mentioned in Lawrence so I
already introduced
her and
luckily she goes by and low it's
very it's very helpful
so.
And then just
reiterate this is
talking about the the price
that we were able to to be
awarded by the federal
small business administration
it was a competitive program
the only awarded 11 percent
of the applicants we were
very proud to be
awarded and then
for the stage to
funding
again it was competitive
rate it was
only the the for the 40
stage one Ortiz that were
actually eligible
to
apply for that stage to
funding but the
only awarded.
35 and so
you know they were still I that that
got cut out and so we
really we
at white or brown
disincentive we got both of them
so with that
stage one and stage to funding
we're putting it completely back
into rural New
Mexico we've
identified that
we have spent the last
5 years developing
programs that have been able
to increase the amount of bioscience
industry we've been able to
increase the visibility of the
biocides industry of the New
Mexico but it's
been primarily in the
urban locations because
we're in the river we're in the
urban locations
I came from rural Nebraska
and so I have an affinity
to rural America
and so when I saw this
program come up and it was
talking about underserved
communities I
quickly identified rural
New Mexico as being that
underserved community
and so being able to
go into the rural
communities and be able to
bring the programs that we already
have and to
make sure that the rural
communities and the rural
businesses are taking
advantage of the resources that are
available and also
that we are meeting the needs
that they have if resources
are not available
is a really big priority
and the small business administration
agreed we
got our our $200000
to be able to work on this
one of the big pieces with that that we're
going to do is to contract with
the compact technologies to build
the comprehensive eco
map and then
also to provide
mentoring networking
you know small businesses at
assistance in any way that we
possibly can.
We have our first kick off
meeting of the
ecosystem November
3 of 20
at New Mexico tech if any of you
are around Sapporo
you're very welcome to join
us it's going to be
really fun experience and
we're gonna be meeting quarterly after
that.
Just the next pages
just a breakdown of the organization
of the the rural biotech
ecosystem.
That the small business administration
terms where the catalyst
and then we're connecting all of
those different pieces of the the
biotech businesses
the economic development organizations
investment organizations
research and development work is
organizations and
workforce development organization
so we're really excited to be able
to put those
together a
piece that we included in the grant
was to say that anywhere
outside of Albuquerque Rio
Rancho Santa Fe and Los
crucis are considered to be
rural and so
that includes all the rest of New
Mexico which is most of
New Mexico so we're really
excited that that that's where our
initiative is going to be
focused.
I said that that grant is
$200000 which is
fantastic
but.
It's not going to be
enough for us to
move it forward after the grant is
done and so something that
we are going to be asking the
legislation for in
the session is
$650000
in additional funding
to be able to
really
build our
organization
to be able to continue the
efforts that that grant has
allowed us to start
but also to be able to build
on it what we have the
capacity to to to
do we want to
hire a grant developer I
have 10 plus years
of experience in research
development but I'm one
percent and I'm trying to do a
lot of different
things
and I can't do it all and so I
really want to get a grant developers
to be able to not only work
with small businesses to
help them with their SBIRS
teacher grants but I
also want to go after something
big I don't know if you
guys heard about the NSF
engines program
right now the
aerospace
proposal is in the final
stages of being considered
to be funded by the NSF which
is fantastic.
I also uses was not part
of that program
because we were not ready
and I want us to be ready
and so with this grant developer I'm
really hopeful that we will be able
to submit a proposal
to something big like
that that
the amount that the
engine's going to be awarding
it's $100000000
that would go over 5
years that's a lot
of money to be able to spend
to be able to help
research move from commercialization
I mean from
universities in the
commercialization to meet the
needs of
the communities that they
serve but
again. We need to
be able to have those people in place
to be able to help out with that
hiring in network facilitator is
a really big piece that I'm also
excited about
it would be able to create a
bioscience coalition throughout the
state to be able to keep us
all focus on going
forward I'm New
Mexico has identified 9
industry all
of those industries need to
have an advocate to be
able to help them get
together to be able to make sure that
they're not
duplicating efforts to make
sure that they're all working on the same
piece that's what the New Mexico
bioscience Authority is doing for
the bioscience industry
and that's what we want to keep
doing we want to
create internships and mentoring
programs with the research
universities as well as the
smaller universities like Navajo
tech like San Juan college
like northern New Mexico
all of these different players that
want to be participating
we want to be able to help them
out.
Yes so that's
that is what that program is going to be
doing and then moving
on now we're ready for the
$50000000
discussion.
A good afternoon madam chair
and committee members
my name's Paul
lore
I'm a entrepreneur in
the biotech sector
my current company is
called mercury bio
and how we're developing a drug
delivery platform for
bioactive molecules
such as the
mRNA were
vaccines that we're all familiar
with as a result of
COVID and
it's an incredibly explosive
space in terms of the
technology.
The other
big pharma and biotech
companies are focused
on our innate
drugs there's a a number of
different flavors of
Arnie's
but the and there's
tremendous amount of investment
going into this field
to cure everything from
cancer
to
genetic disorders
to
viral infections
we're but the
the space that
we're in right now
is a delivery
system for these molecules
so we're getting
a lot of attention from big
pharma we're located in
Santa Fe were a
start up company
but we're growing rapidly
we just hired I
scientists in the
last 5
months these are high
paying jobs between
75 and a hundred and fifty
thousand a year
2 of the scientists
were already
in New Mexico
they were with another company
that had
downsized and then
3 we brought in from out of
state
so without all
continue the presentation
and I'm happy to talk
about. The
blasts science industry
in particular
if you're interested.
So the way the co investment
fund works is
that it's a.
Public private
partnership.
It it requires that
private funds
to make up
to
62 thirds of the
investment so
2 to 1 match with state
funds.
The
objective is to
create a critical
mass of
biotech companies in the
state so that
come as companies come and
go which they do
biosciences very
long long
play as far as
getting a product to market
goes specific particularly
and pharmaceutical
other sectors of the bioscience
marketers not quite so
long
but
there has to be sort of a safety
net for people that can
move from one company to
another as as
the as their success
in our our lack of
stairs there of
occurs.
So we are
encouraging companies to
move here
artist to start
here and then be
incubated
with funding to
to stay here for at least
5 years
and that's to create
jobs so another part
of this program
is to really create and retain
jobs that are not
dependent on
quantity of
commodities such as oil and
gas or
and or a tourist
economy.
We're asking for a
$50000000
co investment
fund.
So with the with the private
match that would be
150000
total 0 sorry
and that
would be so
recommended by the study
that to.
Stephanie had mentioned
earlier.
So it it it
does
affect.
Industry outside
of pharmaceutical
and one example of that was
a company that I had some
years back I still have it
actually but we built
a LG facility
in Jalan New Mexico
to create jobs in the oil
field using wastewater
from the oil and gas
industry and
we grew grew algae in that
waste water so we
created jobs
that word processed
animal in that they
also sequester carbon
dioxide and they
take advantage of
transitioning
from fossil fuels by creating
jobs in rural
areas.
So the the the idea
behind the The New Mexico
investment program is
that this these funds
stay in the treasury
department
we have our
venture capital groups that
bring yield to
the table and they've already
vetted them we've
at them as well
and then it has to be
signed off by the secretaries
of economic development and
treasury and so forth so there are
guardrails there
and when some companies
do well that money goes
back into the fund
and can find
other start ups.
So I've kind of skip to
head here a little bit
but
all of our we went
through this process last year
with the legislature
passed on both the
house and the
Senate floors
unanimously
right now we're trying to address
some of the governor's concerns
about how do we
how do we have
a way to to
enforce companies
to stay in New Mexico so
that's that's our challenge
this legislative session
is getting the governor
on board so that she's
comfortable that we're we're good
stewards of state
funds.
So I think I
covered this how we
got here but one thing I'll
mention is that
other states are very
aggressive in this space because
they see the value of
investing in
biotech
so Boston is a
huge help for
that we were just
my company was just there as
as a
attending the summit
and San
Francisco San Diego
and North Carolina
are also very big
players so
companies are attracted
by the fact that
the state puts a lot of money
into the into the
in investment and and biotech
companies it's incredibly
important for companies to feel
like they know
they.
They will have a
place to grow
we have resources here
such as Los Alamos
Sandia in the Air Force
resources research
center that are
all creating
incredible ideas and
intellectual property.
What we're trying to do is
take advantage of that
resource and really
develop a commercial
companies out of
the. My chief
science officer's with
the New Mexico founder of my company
was formally a
level 6 scientist
at Los Alamos
and plea
filed 9 patents
already in the last 2
years.
So.
You have
Stephanie already mention this
first co investment that we
did. Saws
skip over that.
And we
have we have some
pretty strict criteria so
that we have a legitimate
deals coming to the
table
obviously like any investment
you look at the management
team and you look at the
intellectual property
portfolio and you
look at the market
potential so
I mean these are these are potential
this market is billions
these companies can be $0
companies it's
absolutely not
possible.
We form a limited liability
corporation
that basically includes
the state as an equal
partner with the
venture capital
group or the angel
investment group as we
have and our first
deal and they
actually the state
owns stock
in the company so it's
like the state investment
fund
where you know
the status actively
investing so if the
company sells or goes
public or is acquired
by another company
the proceeds from that
transaction merger
acquisition
basically come back to the
state so it's a
self sustaining fund right
now we're asking for a
seed money to get it
started but
if the state
investment
Council is any indication
of what can happen that
cut that fund is
going to I think
$2000000000 or something
and since it was started
for an investment of
of one tenth
of
that.
So again
I'm talking about a lot of return
on investment
and why
that's important
so that it's not
it in a while there's a surplus
in the budget this
money can be wisely
invested and
sustain the state through the
down times which
occur when you're.
And largely dependent on oil
and gas which is a
worldwide
commodity.
So the of
the funds as I mentioned would stay
in the treasury
and until the
a deal was identified
and then it would be
invested
and we expect to see
there were there is some risk but I
think the study that Stephanie
mention basically
said that if to
investments are for
investments succeed
and 6 or 8
fail the state
still wins has from
an investment
standpoint.
We hope to get this
bill set up and ready
to go early on in the
legislative session
so last year we were
kind of he was Senate
bill 362 so we're
at the end of the session
as I mentioned we did manage
to get it through
but
it's not quite there
yet.
And so it's 50000000
and
650 for the
startup
accelerator.
Let's see so
right now we
are.
Working on that that
the items that Stephanie
had had gone through.
But I think the most important
thing we can do and and
this was one of the mandates
of the bioscience
Authority when it was founded
was that are
established by the state legislature
that it would be
able to do public
private
partnerships and
really invest money
in staying companies to grow
the economy so
I think with without
the co investment
fund
there's not a lot we can do to
to influence the
the
the industry in New Mexico
and Colorado
Arizona these
these you
madam Stephanie yesterday
yesterday I believe that
Connecticut has sent
$200000000 fund that
invests in bioscience
California invested over
$0 a year and
technology and bio science
so we
we we definitely have the
opportunity here
as Stephanie mentioned with the
quality of life issues
and the technology
that's already here
because of the national labs and
research universities.
To thank you very
much.
Great thank you both so much we
appreciate that we do have
several folks who want
to ask questions we have Representative
Armstrong Senator
Rodriguez Senate RTC
Pino representative Duncan
Representative Akan did you
raise your hand at all
okay all right so
let's go with representative Armstrong
first. Thank
you madam chair and thank you for your
presentation I
am
I am a true believer
in bioscience
and and the industry
that needs to grow here in New
Mexico one
of my questions
is
is there any any leader
funding have have any
bioscience companies
been attracted to New Mexico
through
Lida.
I can I can talk to
that for a bit
order I was working
with have a
lapse several
years ago and
I was able to obtain a
$4000000 leader
grant
but that company was
really well funded and we
had the legal team
and HR team
and financial
controllers and everything
it's it's a it's a
good program
and it does work but I
think for start up companies that
just don't have the resources to
really. Do
all the work that's required to get
is a large the the
grant it's
it's very difficult
and I think this fund is meant
to fill that gap
between start ups
and companies that are on their
series a or series
B. round of funding
funding that can
take full advantage of both pleaded
J. tip and
the.
The industrial revenue
bond. Thank you
for that I I I
wouldn't I can agree
with you more but I I was just curious
if we had any companies like
that I know the processes
of.
Pretty tough one so
that was that was and so
then you you mentioned economic
development and some other one so
I'm I'm but I'm a true believer
in public private partnerships
specifically
because
you do have a little
bit of clawback
sort of where you're
requiring them to stay in the in
the state I've had
companies that
got receive leave the funding
that closed in my area and
move to another area of
New Mexico because of
all electricity was cheaper
because Wirth co op and PNM
could give it to him cheaper so
I I appreciate
you have putting you
know the 5 year
I was curious also
madam chair is
how do you.
How do you receive us a
site cert
cert and what is that
process
thank you madam chair movement and
Representative so
the community reading this program
is self sort of.
I'm sorry
yes.
Those.
I can.
The community
reading this program is
self certified and so
we work with
municipalities and
organizations to
identify sites
that they identify
as being ready for bioscience
companies to move to
and then we have a process
that was created
and approved
through our
board at in collaboration
with outside organizations
like 9 op
to be able to
identify and
then economic
development groups in
a different communities
to be able to
evaluate how
ready communities
work my
understanding is that the
original application
was borrowed
from an application that was
created by the
Massachusetts
back in the day when they were
first developing their bioscience
industry to be able
to do the same thing and
so I I I
was just explaining to
Jessica stern is still here
it looks like she might have
left but I was talking to her from
the yes County about
the community right this program
and even though itself certified
we still ask for the documents
and so you can't just yes
we are that's sure we are
that you need to be able to
show you know what you are
but it's a really great
house cleaning operation
for these municipalities
to really understand what
they do have available
and maybe what they don't have available
to be able to set themselves up to
be successful
and just saying
in in connection to the
last question that you have
had as well
curia has taken
advantage of lead of funding
they're a company that expanded
recently in
Albuquerque
electronic caregiver
in Los crucis
they took advantage of we to funding
they got a quite a bit of
a size of that and
then on teachers toolbox
is probably the most
novel company that has been
able to take advantage of Rita
just like on director lore
said. These
are companies that are larger
and they're more ready to be able to
take advantage of this
well thank you for that
madam chair this leads
back to.
My issue with
the economic
development
certification.
So I I think I've shared before
madam chair that
to.
Merged a middle Rio Grande
economic development
has applied 2 years in a row
to be certified
and they missed it by 5 points
this last year
and so we don't in rural
New Mexico we
don't have economic
development.
Companies or
certifications we
have the more
that you
know. Is an
iron worker
we have you know in in
small municipalities
small villages
and so this
leading back to
why economic development
should be we should
get certified in economic
development because we're doing the
work we're doing everything they're asking
us to do and we cannot
get certified so this
is a very here
madam chair that needs to be
removed and and I
I'm happy to help
remove that barrier thank you madam
chair. And
madam chair along with that
Kristin Keller and I are
are in a lot of
collaboration and I
know her struggles
and so we have talked
to her about the community readiness
certification she's very
much excited about it
as is the county of
Sapporo
economic development but
they like you pointed
out they do not have the bandwidth to be
able to do it and so
now I I've told them
I said I will help you
in every possible
way because
it's a matter of finding
those resources and identifying
what those resources
are which
is something that we can definitely
help to help them
identify thank
you madam chair thank you so much I
appreciate that yes
Kirsten is a bulldog and she
will not let go
but the it's the
problem not only in Sapporo
and Sierra and Valencia
and Katrin
it's problems across its
and and Representative Duncan's
district it's in other districts where
we can't
we're trying
to
economically grow
our
area.
And we just keep hitting brick
walls and so this
is it's just one
more thing that needs to be helped
along and of course
I only want one certified
if their applications
applicables this is
totally out of Google and have
no idea why they
failed by 5 points thank you madam
chair thank you for your help I appreciate
that thank you Representative Senator
Rodriguez thank you madam chairman
good afternoon Stephanie and
call thank you for your great
work you know
the a J. T. I. P.
program through the economic
development department maybe that's something
if you haven't looked into it already
that would be good
as the start up companies continue
I'm just really happy to see that
Santa Fe has 89
of these I didn't realize
that according to your map here
there's 89 of these
companies I'm really grateful
for that thank you
but that being said I
just don't have a quick
question the
staff being that you
need to to do
all these things that you're
doing
you mentioned that you need
to hire a grant
developer madam
chairman
to help other
businesses would that be
other municipalities
to and
businesses or private
businesses specifically
can you answer briefly that
because and I have a follow up quick
question that's it
thank you madam chair
yes the the grant
developer would be able to
work with
anybody who's
working in
biosciences
the the main
idea of it is that it would be
outside of
organizations that already have
grant support
like research universities and
national labs and
so
independent companies
would definitely be working with that
the S. B. I. R. S. T. T. R.
programs are the first
things that come to mind when it comes to
grant funding
they are partnerships
that the
companies are putting
together with researchers
they may be doing them by themselves
but they still typically usually
have a research. Each partner
at the university but they
are the ones that are actually submitting
the requests a lot of
these people do not have any
experience with grant writing
or grant initiatives and
so being able to help them with that
especially after they've done the New Mexico
fast training programs
but then to be able to walk them through
it because you can listen
you know to somebody talking to
you all you like
but I I learned from
to tally of their
they're at cultured meat
company that's I'm
working on developing here in the
state
of.
They said they went through all of the New
Mexico fast
training but they still
were not ready to submit
a grant and after I talked to and
I I had lunch with with you
on and he was like
all I can do this
now you know it's just that
that one on one you know help to
be able to do that but
if you know we're able to help
municipalities out as well
I would love to be able to do
that what I really
hope to be able to do is to go
after some of these larger
federal grants
that are more of
across the board
kind of helps you know to
be able to build up that bioscience
industry throughout the state
okay thank you very much for that
answer in just a quickly to follow
up with that as I said
on page 25 you
indicate you hired this
nice lady but I'm of and
Lori and low Schmitt
all of here
okay
yeah in she's there in the back
to work okay high
in the end
that you indicate that she would
be working she's a
UNM higher but she would be
working as an intellectual pop
property specialist
but working with the NM
BSA and 30
percent of our staff would
be dedicated I think
to support these
development of bioscience
companies that's why I asked the first
question is I wondered
if your
staff with
this new
hire and
it right and
using or
working with
30 percent of her
FTE supporting
this development I just
wondered is that all
like in one
or you have the grant writer
separate and
and and doing
something different here to support
these companies are I'm just
trying to get a visual picture how much
staff you need and what
areas thank you madam today
that's all I have thank you madam
chair and representative I mean
Senator yes you
are right that in
low will be
she's she's we have 30
percent of her time that is allocated
on to the bioscience
Authority she is
a higher from the university of New
Mexico New Mexico
and the amount that
is being put in by
the health. Sciences center
has been dedicated to her
working with the bioscience
Authority it's
similar to the
relationship that we have with Ryan
Kinsley OC
Ryan is our
strategy and policy
director but he's
also the health
sciences center economic development
director and so 20
percent of his time is spent working
with the bioscience Authority 80
percent of its time is work working
with the university and so
analyst time will be split
up similarly
so the 30 percent of her time
that she's able to work with
us you
know we're working on
developing you know the
different training programs and to be able
to work with the facilitation
to be able to help out with
that and I'm
hopeful that her time will
be so meaningful
that maybe I won't be
this person after all right
now she's just started
and so we're just being able to
work into it and so right
now my goal is to be able to
have somebody full time
that would be able to spend all of
their time working with
companies with municipalities
and especially for bringing in municipalities
into the mix of it we really
need somebody to be dedicated
to being able to help out with
that there's a lot of
grant funding available
Dale decker chair sends
me things every day
just like look at this look
at this I'm like yes man I love
it but.
We just don't have the capacity
right now okay thank
you so much for explaining that
good work and now I appreciate
you thank you thanks Matt
thank you senator Senator Ortiz
Y. Pino and Representative
Duncan. Thank
you madam chairman and and thank you
for the presentation
just a couple quick questions about
the bill last
year. Yeah I
thought I thought it had tested
and it got vetoed is that would
happen.
Madam chair and senator
yes that's correct and
and do we have we deal
with whatever objections the
governor had to the bill so
that we will get to do it
again
so madam chairman
center we're
we're working on it
we could use help I'll be
honest with the
again her concern was
that
that there's no teeth
in that bill that if a company
took state funds and
they didn't stay for 5
years and they left what
would be the.
What what what what
would happen and there's you
can do anything about it
and my
thoughts on the matter where
that well if they get a
very large investment
from a company in Boston
and they the investors
require them to move there
then they
then they have to go
but the state
still owns stock in
the company and the
money as the company
does really well that
that money will come back to the
state which can
use it again for
starting new companies
for bridging the gap between
start up and and
the and the mid size company
but that doesn't
address the job
creation component of
this bill
so we're
trying to figure out ways we
can address
that and some
of the ideas or tossing
around is
a board seat if
it's a sizeable
investment
that maybe a company has
to maintain an office
here facility
here even if they expand other
states it's
a really hard one to to
address
because.
The the clawback
issues the clock
back.
Provisions of for
instance Lida
they're hard for a company to match
so for a if a
if a company obtains
a $4000000
leader grant they have to put
aside $4000000 of
operating capital
to be able to for the state
to claw back if they
don't perform up
to their project
participation
agreement.
So so that that
becomes difficult for start up with
limited resources
and similarly the J.
to program which is a very good
program
but it also requires that
just I guess this
is a policy that
EDD has but they want to
see 2 years of runaway
to qualify company to
to for J. to
so do
you know of in all honesty
that's really hard to
yes to
help guarantee
when your start up
so
I I this is gonna be a
little bit of a different.
A horse of a different color
where it I think
it's more risk
involved in this program
but without that I
think we're losing a lot of
good companies a lot
of good ideas
so any any
suggestions human donor may
have as far how
how to address this issue
of you know
being good stewards of state fund
but also being able to take Chris
would be some very
helpful.
Madam chairman of the first
company that did
you did a
Envestnet with
but it wasn't public
private it was using it
New Mexico angels money
at the end of the
new value madam
chair and senator yes that's
if they are $75000
of state money
and $150000
of New Mexico
angels what
do they do. They
have just sort of a cell
sorter to device
as madam chair and
senator they have a
a device that allows
companies to
analyze
particles like cells
that are in a stream
and it's it's
a piece of scientific
hardware that
migratory Quitman that they
make.
Madam chairman just
one last question
the one of your
locations is Santa Ana
pueblo is set
up.
The native American.
Operated.
Program report the
company madam
chair and sorry yes that
is correct and they've
set aside some land
and some funds
and it's I think
it's a coalition of
believe 9
different.
The groups and
they're trying to make that
a hub for
biotech and
and specific and also
medical research
a specific to
the
native American
population as well
created madam chairman
you you said in
jail you used waste
water or produced water
waste water is produced
water but but I
missed would put to you growing down
there
that insurance center
we we started
to we actually were part
of a large coalition
the National Alliance for
advanced bio science and bio
products that was
awarded a $50000000
grant from department of energy
in 2010
Los Alamos national lab was
lead on that
and.
I was 3
national labs
12 universities and 15
companies my
company at the time was Eldorado
biofuels and we
were growing
algae and treated
produced water
and so is an
aquaculture
play and
that we match that
with the $0 of
private funds that we
are. A half
$0 grant
and.
When the price of oil cratered
in 2015 we
just couldn't keep the
lights on that
idea is now more
relevant though because of
the carbon capture
and and storage
issues that are
now being funded
by
companies and NGOs the
2 offset
carbon emissions so that
that that model that
business model can absolutely work
now.
Madam chairman is anybody doing
that well if I can
for some time out to it
but we
we madam chair
and senator no I I don't know if anyone
is doing at the moment
but we did do
a feasibility
study about a year ago
we determined that
to sequester all
of the carbon
emissions produced in the year
and the world would take
a how deep on the size
of the state of
Texas
which
is something that gives me
hope because we
actually can
reduce carbon emissions in the
atmosphere
I think madam chairman I think that's a
great idea and if you would actually
use Texas for the LG
punts I would hope
for thank you madam
chair thank you
senator last the
person's representative Duncan
thank you madam chair I'll make it
quick
I was talking to an individual
and they had indicated
that in the process of
becoming a certified
community
that.
There was perhaps an
argument that took place
and they the question they
wondered was as
a result of the argument one
from
EDD and one from
the community was striving
to do this
they wondered if because of that
argument if they were knocked down a
few points as a result of
that and did not get
certified so
I would really encourage us not
to pick winners and losers in
this and and
figure another way that
you know we might be able to go online
and fill it out that
way as opposed to
perhaps picking winners
and losers I'm all
in in your camp I think it's
great to great thing we
need to continue to these are
businesses that create
high paying jobs
and and I'm all for that thank
you madam chair.
Thank you Representative and thank you
committee for order for questions
thank you both for being
here today appreciate
all your efforts and and
what you're doing and encourage you
to keep keep having
conversations with with
folks in the legislature.
I thank you so much.
All right we have
next Senator
Ortiz C. Pino along
with Tom Solomon
Solomon who is an
electrical engineer facilitators
with 350 New Mexico it's good to
see you Tom and also
Dr sherry Kelly
who is a senior geophysicist
and field geologist you too
all make the rounds and like you should
have like tour shirts
of how many committees you go and
talk to about
this topic thank you so
much.
And so I will let
you go ahead and leave
that conversations
Senator if you want to start that
offer if you want Taimur Dr
Kelly to do that it's all
yours thank you madam
chairman and members of the
committee I'll kick
it off the
associated with the few
brief introductory comments
and then I'll turn it over to the people
who actually know
something about geothermal
energy.
I think you.
We we may have made a presentation
to this committee last year I was in
it but I think Tom
and and Dr Kelly
were
and.
This is the result
of the
the 2 year long
process that we've been going
through with
the what we call our geothermal
working group.
This started when
somebody sent me an
email with a link to a
Ted talk
and it was right
after the
22
legislative session
and I was just immediately
struck by how
appropriate geothermal
energy would be in New
Mexico and
and how we really
have in
place much
of what would be required
to develop a full
blown
multi leveled
geothermal.
In the industry in the
state so I called
Tom
who I knew from
other work on
environmental issues
and we began meeting with
the a group of people
that that basically he
assembled
Senate president pro
tem Mimi Stewart
and her staff were were
part of those meetings we met
every 2 weeks for a couple of
years former
representative
kill of us
was part of that
group.
Then that we brought
in Dr
Kelly from New Mexico
tech to
to.
Doctors from New Mexico
state drive
go the role of a
and Dr Patricia
Sullivan and more
recently we that it
in Zach Miller
met from senator
Heinrich's office because
they're very interested
in geo thermal as well
we prepared a bill last
year made
presentations to several
committees got it
through the Senate with not a single
dissenting vote
got it through the house with I think
3 votes against
it and then
ran into a
good a gubernatorial
veto
which was quite surprising
we had met with the governor's
staff earlier and had no
inkling there was any problem
with developing this
bill we met with
them again we think
we've overcome it whatever
objections they had the governor's
offered to make this
part of our call in the upcoming
session so we're back
before you with the
second go round
and.
One of the reasons were so interested
in geothermal is
because it
really would put us over the
top if you add
up what is available
through wind power
in the state most
of which is on the east side of the
mountains.
Solar power in the
state you
still have
the persistent
10 to 20 percent
of the Energy requirements
energy demands of the
state that can't be
met with renewable
sources with
those 2 renewable sources
alone because the wind
doesn't always blow and the sun
doesn't always shine
and well there's been efforts to
make the difference
up with battery
storage and
with the
other
options 2
US geothermal offers the
perfect solution because
it's available all the
time. It's
inexhaustible.
You're not ever going to run out of the
earth's heat we're if you
do is going to be so far in the
future that none of us
will be threatened with reelection at
that time
the and and we
really have a clean
0 emission source of
energy that
could get can do a number
of things one of which is
developed electricity
produce
electricity.
It's also
an approach that uses
New Mexico's existing
no hello we
have oil and
gas drilling rigs in the
state that are already
doing deep drilling.
The technology is
there the man
power is there
the the
know how is there
to really get something
done in regard to
geothermal energy
what we lack is
something some some
cohesive effort
to bring together all of what
we know in a state
that has probably
some of the best options
for geothermal in the country I
think Dr Kelly
says we're we're one of the
top 5 or 6 states in
terms of how close to
the surface
hot enough rocks
are that we could easily
access them.
And so our goal of this next
session.
Is going to be to pass
the bill that we
had last time we'll go into
some of the details about
that a little later in our
presentation
with that I'm gonna turn it over
to 2 of
the Tom
Solomon from 3 fifty.org
who's been so active in
working on
this.
Thank you senator and
madam chair.
Members of the committee
were if you're following
along on a presentation or on page
5
the geothermal goals so our
goal for
that we developed in this
working group is
is a 2 part goal
and as a senator said
we want to pass our geothermal
bill
to do really 2
things 2
developed the full spectrum
of New Mexicos geothermal
resources that it is quite a
spectrum phase
one is to develop
and expand what we already have
in place the the
existing geothermal
resources that
includes
using direct
you thermal energy
to keep greenhouses
we have a very large one and
Dona Ana County
he pumps for
buildings we
have a whole network of hot
springs and spas in the
state and we have one
clean electricity generating
plant so
find funds
grants loan
opportunities
to those existing businesses
they can expand
while in the
into the 20 thirties
we work on promoting the
longer term development
of of the truly
transformative
advance you thermal electricity
that is the center said
we believe could provide that
final 10 percent
the most difficult piece
of the
clean energy transition
because
geothermal energy has the
real advantage of being a
24 by
7 fully
dispatchable
dependable
clean source of electricity
and we believe that that
opportunity could be as much
as one to 3
gigawatts of electricity
generation of the state
providing that last 10
percent.
On to page 6 is
just a graphic showing
what the center of the earth looks
like it is really
hot in excess of
9000Â°F
and as you go
closer to the surface it cools
off but it is still quite
warm as much as
400Â°F
5 miles
underground
well above the boiling point
of.
Of water and
the shallower
depths can be higher
temperatures depending
upon the geology of that
you're dealing with
with the crust is thinner
and very
shortly Dr Kelly will
explain that in some detail
on page 7 you see a map
of the United States
from the national renewable energy
laboratory ranking
New Mexico is number 6
in there
ranking of geothermal resource
availability for
the state
and that takes advantages
of some of New Mexico's
unique geology
that Dr Kelly will
now explain.
Thank you madam chair and
committee
recently we had a
workshop at New
Mexico tech where
we invited
representatives from the
geothermal industry
to share
their thoughts
about.
Barriers to development
of of of our
resources and
opportunities
and not will circle back to the
that discussion a little bit
later in the talk but one of the
things that
came out in that
workshop is
that many people in
the geothermal industry
recognize that we
have Coaticook good
geology
we have ideologically
teacher in that
runs through the center
of the state of New Mexico that's called
the Rio Grande rift
which is illustrated on
slide 8
and it's a place
where the earth's crust
is being stretched
in the end and as a
consequence of that
geologic process
warmer material
wells up closer
to the surface of the earth
and our
enhances our
geothermal
potential.
Mexico is that the the diagonal
line.
Okay on the on
the on the straight and
on the illustration on
the
left that is a
map that
shows where the cross
section is so
the the
illustration on the left
is a map you
and that line
is a place where we we
sliced to take
a sideways
picture into the into the
earth and made
a cross section is shown
in the illustration on the right
okay so just a question I guess is
the the the Rio Grande rift
run north to south or does
it it runs north to south
it is right it is represented
by that dotted line
all right just to the state of New Mexico
okay great thank you for the clarification
my apologies for Frederick
nope nope.
All so
in New Mexico
our best
resource is in the Hayman's
mountains in the bicycle
there in its
the a great
resource
because there
is a cooling magma chamber
in the southwest corner of the
bias Caldeira.
Unfortunately that
resource is now part
of a national park in is
currently off
limits.
So the rest of our geothermal
resources are what we call
gravity driven
systems
and what happens in this
the in these situations if you
look at
the Austrasian on slide
9 we have rain
and snow falling on the
mountains into
percolates down into
the earth and it picks
up Pete that
hi background
heat from the Rio
Grande drift
and and moves
towards the the Rio
Grande the modern
river and
if it encounters some sort
of a geologic structure
such as there's a coral
canyon fault
our that
there there might be a
permeability there
that allows the water to percolate
up in for my hot springs and
so we we those are
known resources that we can
easily find
on the ground
sometimes though
the water gets down
in into the sub surface
and it gets stock
under so impermeable
layer and that forms
or call blind
General systems and those are
a little bit harder to
find.
Of the.
Slide 10 shows
the distribution of are
known hot springs
and hot Wells
and you can
see that in general
they
are
that mimic
the locality
of the the Rio Grande
drift.
And in these hot wells
we can take temperature as a
function of doubt
in concur brick project
those temperatures to 3
kilometers of the
illustration on the left
shows what temperatures
are like at
about 3 kilometers
which is about 10000 feet
which is kind of a
typical debt for about
what.
I think this back to
you.
Thank you Dr Kelly
we're on page
11.
Well we're we're going to
explain the different
kinds of geothermal energy
which very
by deaths and starting
at the surface
in these first 3 or kind
of all Representative by
what is in
place in New Mexico today
close to the surface
we're talking about ground source
heat pumps and that
is provides
the opportunity for heating
and cooling for buildings
and we're talking about 5 to
300 feet of
depth so pretty close
to the surface
if you go down to 1000
feet
you tapping
into hot
springs and opportunities
for direct
use
and of course the hot springs
bubble up to the surface but some of
those hot springs
originate at that
depth going down
to 6000
feet or more
you're talking about
very deep hot water
aquifer's that are the
source of traditional geothermal
or hydro thermal
electricity and
are one example of that here in
New Mexico is the
lightning dock PNM
geothermal plant
just south of
Lordsburg.
The real opportunity that
we are excited
about in the lunch
served as the chief of a working
group is what we're calling phase
2 in that set of
goals which is
advanced you thermal
electricity in
closed loops in deep
hot rock in excess
of 15000 feet and
I'll speak much more about
that in a few
slides.
On page 12 are some
examples of real life
of what
geothermal
Development has taken
advantage of in New Mexico
today starting with
mass and farms that very
large greenhouse
in radium springs Dona
Ana County the second
largest geothermal
heated greenhouse in the
United States
about 20 acres of
greenhouse
complexes
employees somewhere a little
bit south of 200
people so a very
large employer and done in
a County and
their owner
Alexander Masson has said
that geothermal
heating saves them
a good 93 percent
on their heating bill
so instead of
you know using a lot of natural
gas to heat all those
greenhouses they just
use the geothermal
sort resource
underground pipe it
through the complex and the
heat the heat
the flowers in that way.
Lightning dock is the our
electric power plant
near Lordsburg gets a
geothermal electric
generation facility for
PNM about
15 megawatts.
I of course have 29 hot
springs in New Mexico
stretching from the
north all the way to the south
along at Rio Grande
research corridor
there is
also
an aquaculture
facility
adjacent to the
lightning dock facility
and they use
geothermal heat
to find just the right
temperature for growing
tilapia fingerlings
which then get shipped around the
rest of the United States to
grow to full size
and end up on your
plate.
And then finally ground source heat
pumps are actually in use
in quite a number of
large buildings in New
Mexico we were able
to identify
quite a number of school
facilities
and APS Rio
Rancho
Alamogordo
and in downtown
Albuquerque the Sims
office buildings heated
by geothermal
Heat.
So that's what geothermal
energy is today and on
page 13 in
some details of the geothermal
development built
that senator Ortiz if you
know we'll talk to us
about.
Yeah we we actually introduced
a twin bills last year
the in the Senate
the Senate bill 7
and in the house it was of
Representative Roybal
Caballero was a prime
sponsor
and that was house bill
365 we
were building on an
earlier piece of legislation
that was passed in
2017
sponsored by
Senator Griggs and
Representative Townsend
that created the the
the first.
Language in our in our
legislate in our statutes
around geothermal.
So what we were trying to do
was.
Create the framework
for geo geo thermal
activity in the state
and
the first thing was we wanted to
create is a Jew thermal research
center of excellence
at New Mexico
tech
while the bill that
did set it up was
vetoed we were
able to get into house bill to
the money for that
geothermal
center of excellence at New Mexico
tech and that's where the
doctor Kelly currently
is the director
and she'll be talking about some of the
things they've done already
the in addition to that
we wanted additional staff
in energy minerals and natural
resources currently they have
one guy who's like one
quarter time on
geothermal and
and it is it
it's you know just a
token almost we
were asking for them to hire at
least 3 or 4 more people
we are asking for an appropriation
of I think
$600000
to add to their
responsibility that'll be part
of the bill this year.
Then we had 2 big
funds one was a
$10000000 loan
fund.
And that was
a to $10000000 grant
Fund and that was basically
to to help universities
are the departments of state
government with
money to use as
match for
federal money federal
project money that might be
coming up they could apply
to that fund get
the match from it and then
draw down federal money
to get the project off
the ground these just be limited
to the universities and
the state agencies
environment energy minerals
whichever one
is some of the universities
have have
projects in the works
that matching
funds would be very helpful
for them the
second with the public
to and the public is well
that's exactly
and then the the second
fund was a $15000000
revolving loan
fund that would be
available to businesses that
would be trying to get
projects off the ground it
play to that.
We had a second bill so that
was what was in the did you thermal
resources development bill
we had a second bill that was
a tax credit bill
and it had 2 signs of tax
credit one
eliminated
provided for gross receipts
tax deduction on on the
construction costs
as as companies prepare we're
putting up the building they
would be able to apply
for a deduction from for
their gross receipts
tax for that but
the second one was a production
credit that is a
company started developing
electricity and was
actually producing
electricity they can
apply for this credit
that would reduce the
the overall cost
and and and that
was incorporated into the
comprehensive tax
bill the legislature
passed that those
provisions along with many
others were and the is
line item vetoed out of that
deal so we have to go
back to the drawing board and both
of those that's what we're
proposing for this coming year
tax credit bill and
the geothermal resources
development
bill.
Thank you senator
and then on page
14
just a quick snapshot
of the federal level
so we've identified
with the help of senator Heinrich's
office working
with gentleman their names Act
Milam at. Over
$500000000
in potential
geothermal funds at the federal
level that we could
potentially bring some of
to our state with some
of the matching funds
in these bills that we're talking
about there was
a $500000000 clean
energy demonstrations on
current and former mine land
which we certainly have in New
Mexico
another 84000000
in advance geothermal
energy
a number of others that I will
go through in detail but
suffice it to say
that we
are perceiving a
lot of support from the federal
government the
have put out the call
and are really looking
for states to come
up with geothermal
projects that they
can help support the federal level
and we would love to do
that.
If you turn to page
15
the server just a few
of the geothermal development
opportunities in New Mexico
that we've identified
there was a study done by
the pueblo Z. in
2012
through the department of energy
looking at renewable
energy development
opportunities
including geothermal
on their public lands
and the the
next slide is all about
that
there's another slide that we'll talk
about briefly a
very interesting opportunity
at mesa del sole just
south of Albuquerque.
Where you could
conceive of a whole series
of integrated uses
of geothermal
energy
using the
the heat as it
successively cools off
but it's still available
to use and of course in
New Mexico State
University there was a big
geothermal complex
started in the 19
eighties that we
would love to be able to
revitalize
and quite a number of other
ones I will go through them
but suffice
it to say that through the work
that we've done just
opt identifying the
opportunities for
geothermal
in New Mexico there's
a long list and
we would love to get after it
page 16 is that the
a Pueblo study.
And then on page 17
is the mesa del
sole geothermal
concept
and just to take you through it
quickly this is an
opportunity what we call
cascading benefits
where if
you start
with drilling a
well C. C.
13000 feet to
some geothermal
resource that we believe is
available at that
property bring it
up.
Maybe create a
5 megawatt
geothermal electric generation
facility
and then but use
the out flow water after
it's gone through the electric
plant it still has enough
heat that you would be able
to potentially flow with
through the mesa del
sol housing complex
as District
heating as many
communities do
including most
of the community Reykjavik
Iceland and
then still use that
out flow water
to potentially provide
industrial processes for
low grade heat like
a greenhouse
heating and drying
Chiles and onions and process
use maybe making
adobe and if you're
really creative you could
create a little tourist
spot there for a
hot spring so
that is an
opportunity for
multiple uses of the
same heat that you bring up from
the earth and then at after
all of that is done
you injected back into that
aquifer deep underground it
heats back up again
and the cycle
continues
that's cascading
benefits on page
18 is the
New Mexico State University
geothermal prod
project
in starting in
1979
they drilled looks
like
4 or 5 different
production wells
for geothermal hot
water and it was
piped throughout the
campus
provided a number
of
uses it
heated
dorms it heated the
Pan Am
athletic center
and it was used
to develop some of
the businesses including that
tilapia far that we talked
about
that was a kind of an
early stage use of
geothermal
hot water and much
has been learned since
that time
including how to
better use the
that resource and
not to create the
conditions were. That may clog
itself up through the
precipitated
solids
we know much better about how to do
that but the
whole infrastructure is
still there even though
it's mostly
been.
Fallen into disuse
one of the opportunities that
we would like to pursue
is to revitalize some of that
geothermal infrastructure on
and I miss you.
That brings us to page
19 we're we're
talking about phase
2 the
opportunity for advanced
you'll thermal
electricity
just using
drilling technology
and creating a closed
loop deep into the
earth we're talking
15000 feet of
depth
where you would create a
network of
underground wells
using the
horizontal drilling
technology pioneered
by the oil industry and
create what's called the
subsurface radiator
you would inject
fluid from the
surface.
So you don't need an
existing aquifer
underground you're
supplying that fluid
that he transfer fluid from the
service you pumped deep
underground it heats
up come to the surface
extracted he'd
and run
electric turban and that's
basically what we're
talking about on pages
19 and
20.
And that is
an example of
what's called advanced
geothermal
electricity
in the United
States
the earlier generations
of these hydrothermal
operate and I think
supply somewhere
on the order of 3
gigawatts of electricity
to the U. S. power
grid so
geothermal electricity
is is a thing
that happens
in abundance mostly in
California and Nevada
and the cost of geothermal
electricity today
in those facilities
is roughly competitive with the
natural gas power plant
just a to
put a cost number on it
on page 21
is the Sandia
labs geothermal
research
lab which they have
you know Albuquerque and
Senator Ortiz Y. Pino and some of
the other members met with
them previously
establish those contacts they are
very very interested in working
with us to develop New
Mexico's resources
and on page 22
is a list of some of the top
geothermal energy start
ups and we see
spoke to 2 of them
through the process of
understanding
how to form this bill
in a way that would be useful
for geothermal start ups we spoke
to for oil energy
and we spoke to
ever the top
2.
And it turns out since that
time
made some contact with tetra
Corp which is
actually
Albuquerque based
company that
has pioneered the use
of drilling technology
using pulsed
lasers
so some advanced
stuff going on here
for vo in ever were
very helpful in
providing ideas
for how to craft this bill in a way
that would be very helpful
ever ever then
I came to New Mexico
we're on to page 23
now and
drilled a
test well
adjacent to the lightning dock
facility they went
down 18000
feet in depth reach
temperatures of 250
degrees centigrade
which is about
480Â°F.
Very hot and
established
the did the directional
drilling they
actually did this all with
a drilling rig that they brought over
from Texas it was
a previously oiled
unit drilling rig
with that same creating
they use the same people in their
same or expertise they
just drilled into hard
rock and they
established a
number of their
technology and hit another
their milestones that they were
able to get some additional
funding
and then they went to the vetted to
develop their project
so
that's the way of things
we hoped
that we would
be able to have a geothermal
incentive bill to entice
them to do for some of that
development
and
bill those businesses up
in New Mexico and I think that can
still be done on
page 24 is the
other company that we talk to
with an exciting
announcement they made
just last month in September
that the
got a contract
to build the
nation's first
hot geothermal next
generation plants
it's going to be in Utah
of 400 megawatts so
now we're talking about a real
utility scale
geothermal electric plant
using advanced you thermal
electricity of
that closed loop variety
that we're talking about
and they are
looking forward to
phase 1 operation at
2026 and school
full scale production and
2028 so
this is coming very rapidly
it is a an industry
that is developing
with real speed
like month by month
there are new developments
and
Dr Kelly talked about
the geothermal workshop that
we held
at the New Mexico Texas court
campus and on
page 25 she's going
to take over the microphone to
talk so about how
the conference went and what we
learned.
Thank you thank you
madam chair and members
of the committee
about 3 weeks ago
we had a a workshop
at on the campus of New Mexico
tech we
invited representatives
from industry
bill and we had
about a dozen
representatives from industry
in the in the room
and then another dozen
are listening in
via zoom
state companies will work
that involved or for of
all and ever
and some of the other
small start ups that
are interested in the
state of New Mexico
I also invited some
of people who are pretty high
up in an international
organization called
geothermal pricing
and one of them
attended in
person.
So though the way the workshop
went as we started
out by having
presentations
from the national labs
and from the university's
leading these industries
Representative snow
what kind of research was going
on in the state of New
Mexico.
And then after that
we had a couple of panel
discussions one
panel was
in person and when they were
sitting in the room for
and on the other
and then we had a second
convening just
logistically
for people who are
online.
And they were both asked the same
questions
what are the barriers
to developing
our resources
what are the
opportunities
and the the
next
slide
summarizes some of
those results
and the number one thing
that we heard is we need
to reduce delays
in permitting
especially at the
federal level
now it turns out
that senator
Heinrich's
Representative
Zachary element is
working pretty hard
with other
senators and
then Representative
to try to
smoothed out
that.
Permitting process at
the federal level
and it at
this point
geothermal
the yield will industry is
exploring the whole range
of temperatures as you kind of
heard
Tom alluded to from
ground source heat pumps
to
and deep direct
use to
EGS and
each of those types
of developments
require slightly different
things what they're trying to
unify make make
it technology and
gnostic
at and then cater
for some of the permitting
to some of the
more.
More in the
deeper
explorations of the
of the sub
surface.
Of another
point that came up is
that
upfront cost
for building
geothermal facilities
at can be
hi but the
interesting thing is that
once you get it set
up the
maintenance
especially of something like a
ground source heat pump
is is very low
some ground source heat
pumps have been in the
ground for
30 to 50 years
and they're still working.
So that's in
your we need to be
a little bit better
about
explaining that
to folks
also we
are encouraged to do what we're
doing here today is
educate the public about
geothermal
resources.
And one thing
that we heard very loud and
clear from
the geothermal
Representative is
they would like a one
stop shop
for finding general
data figuring out
the permitting process
and other important
information for developers
and we're
we're getting that
process.
And one other
aspect is engaging
the utilities and the
design of transmission
infrastructure for general
power plants
in remote areas
we are.
Have yet to
and included
the utilities
in this process
but in a couple
weeks we have some folks from
Texas coming to
help
US start that
process because they have
experience
with dealing with both the
utilities and the oil
and gas industry.
And of course there are
many opportunities
here in our
state
we've already alluded to the fact
that we have in oil and gas
workforce they can easily
transfer their skills
to the general and
industry we
have a legislature
that is
expressing interest in supporting
geothermal we
have awesome
geology here in New
Mexico and
we have general expertise
international labs in our
universities
and we have a climate
in our state that is appropriate
for get requests our heat pump
Development for heating and
cooling. So with
that I'll turn it back to
top. A
trip so
to wrap it up
you know New Mexico has got this
great resource number 6 in the
in the country we would love
to be able to
develop it and have the
incentive package to
bring some of those companies
to start up here and grow
and develop the resource and
provide jobs and clean
energy
it is a great opportunity
to transition some of the
skills and equipment from the
oil and gas
industry lots of
federal money to apply
for and
as a senator said we do
intend to
introduce
bill similar to what we
did last year
hopefully this time with the governor
support and to get
him all the way through the process
and all the way home
pastor desk thank
you.
We wish you the best of luck on that
one because I
think it was a surprise
to a lot of folks that it was P.
to last year so I'm glad that you're able
to have those conversations
thank you very much for your presentation
we do have Representative
Duncan so
far I'm not sure if there's anybody
else representative
Allison.
Senator
Rodriguez.
Okay.
Okay go ahead
Representative.
You madam chair
Senator I'm I'm
with you on this one
I love this quick
question and it may be
for.
It may be for one of
the panel members there with
to.
When you talk about a need to
wear a G. T. the face to
advanced
ADT.
When you're talking about injecting
a liquid could that be
processed water could that
be what what would that
be.
Madam chair
representative.
It has the
potential I think
of the heat transfer
fluid is
often just considered to be
water I
think carbon backside
has been
used
directly is he transfer
apparently has good to he
transfer capabilities
could produced water of
be used for that
I think we need to
just examine that pretty
carefully and make sure
that using
that with the additional
chemicals in that
didn't end up
clogging the whole a
circulatory system and
I'm not sure about what of what that would
mean. Thank you
thank you madam chair.
One of
those.
Yes.
No thank you very much
Representative and so I have
Representative Allison
Representative Akan
Representative little
and did I miss anybody
Senator these of us
are my apologies thank you
Senator Rodriguez your next because
you yes.
Thank you madam chairman good afternoon
senator and the doctor
Kelly and Tom
we did hear this
proposal at the
LESC I think it was
and I think we were in Farmington I
can't remember anymore but
either way it's
it's wonderful I I
can't see
why other than
the financial restrictions
that sometimes become
you know so apparent
that we shouldn't
do something about this it's
a free resource it's of
their
available and
as you said Senator madam
chairman Senator Ortiz
Pino you know this would fill
in the gap that no
matter how much we do and
in solar and wind
they're still that piece it doesn't get
fulfilled
and I
just I don't think you should be
seen
only as an option it
should be seen so something to
augment what we
currently are doing
and then doing everything we
can to table and all
things together for alternative
energy and I'm
so grateful for your
persistence in this
Senator and I'm
hoping that this year we can
do something that finally we can
see it become reality
I don't have any questions
but do you have any quick comment before
I turn it over just
we're hoping to make another
presentation and just a
reminder kind of
presentation to
the LFC
either this month or early
next so they make sure
that we get their
support for this
appropriation thank
you I think I'm happy you're going to do
that thanks madam chair thank
you Senator Rodriguez representative
Allison.
Thank you madam chair.
In my
family's
important area down in Mexico had
to do we have a
hot springs and natural hot
springs
and of
the only use it has
is produced
water for their livestock
and it wasn't and it isn't very
good water source
but the temperature coming out of there
is pretty warm
could have potential
as a generation
site.
That water I know has been running
for over 70
years.
Hi Matt madam
chair and
representative I've
heard about this well I've never
actually visited it it would
be interesting
to go visit it and
measure its
temperature
and I think it is
a new low temperature
resource not
hot enough to produce
electricity
but it
could could be used to
he's greenhouse
okay of this well
madam chair this well is
on the Navajo Nation
so if it could be
develop it could be and
Economic loose to
the Navajo Nation
and then the second part of my question
is.
Could a well site
real will say
eventually involve
into what you
might call a
man made
volcano.
Only if you're drilling in
Iceland.
Where you have magnitude
they have accidentally
hit magma
in Iceland because it
is a of
okay but in New
Mexico
we are we don't
have.
Active volcanoes at the
at the moment okay
thank you thank you madam
chair thank you representative
Representative welcome.
Thank you.
Do. I am
just curious about one
thing going
into the ground and we're really
big hole.
What is that going to do the
environment in the
future.
Is there any effect in
the
future.
Madam chair and and
Representative.
Certainly the oil and
gas industry has put
tremendous numbers of
was a 20000
in
just the San Juan
basin alone
and if
they do
any well
yes oil and gas
or or
general of the comes to the end
of its useful
life
has to be properly
plugged and
abandoned.
And there are are very stringent
rules for that now I
know that
there are still there have been
some bad actors
who have walked away from
their wells at the fact this so
how to wells in eggs
example
and unfortunately the
then the state gets stuck with the
bill.
The only thing that I that makes
we wonder is you know
for some reason.
The earth is got that heat
in there and we're
gonna extracted.
We expect that
he. And
that's what I'm thinking of
what's going to happen after
we remove that
he this year's
get cold what
happens.
We are very
madam chair and and
Representative we
are very lucky
here on planet earth
there is a process and
natural process it
goes on
insiders called
radio activity
so things like uranium
thorium and potassium
are present in great
abundance in the
within the earth
and they are
continuously.
Indicating and
keeping our heat
budget.
Going there was
a a
scientist
back.
In the late 18 hundreds name lord
Kelvin
who did
a calculation where
he said well
okay
if
we've got this big ball
in its radiating
heat
out
and just cooling off
from the temperatures of
formation how long
would it take and it would take it
turns out it takes 100000000
years for just
a the wall of the earth
to to cool
off of it
then later
madam Curie found
the radio activity
and we found that we do have a
continues he
engine.
Just a thought madam chair that
order long destroying that out
there for people to think about
it.
Thank you Representative
Representative little.
Thank you madam chair
thank you so much for the
presentation today.
I have a couple
questions one of the
ones that I think is important
to me is you
mentioned on slide
26
that you're
wanting to engage with
utilities to
design transmission
infrastructure for
these plants in rural
areas and
it leads me to the
question
of
madam chair
will it
sounded like at the beginning
of your presentation that this
is a geo thermal
has a high
potential for
to serve the consumers
of New Mexico.
And what I'm hearing
with this one
is it or is
it part of this
is that is the
intent for this energy
to go out of state or is it going
to serve our
local
communities.
Madam chairman and and Representative
little I think
with this.
Statement on slide
26 was getting at
is.
When you have
for example lightning
dock is down near
Lordsburg.
And it it could
be. Perceived
as meeting the needs of that immediate
area pretty easily
but if you've already gone
to the expense of drilling this
deep well
and and building something
like they're building in Utah
the 400 megawatt
lightning dock is what
1515
megawatts the
1 they're building in Utah a much
deeper much more
expensive there for
is going to produce for
the capacity to produce
400 megawatts
then you gonna wanted to serve
a bigger area
and just to get it from Lordsburg
for example to Los
crucis or
to Silvercity
or to some of the nearby
would probably take some
transmission so that's what they're
getting at here I don't
think we're thinking of this is
being part of the interstate
grid the way solar
and wind are
this is more how do you get it
from this well
that you've chosen for
its geothermal
activity.
To the market place that
need to right around that
area those are the transmission
lines no of I may stand
corrected that'll let Dr
Kelly correct me if I'm
wrong.
Senator you're you're quite
correct
and.
Madam chair and and
Representative
another thing to
think about in in terms
of.
You know a lot of times these
geothermal systems
are being developed and worked really
remote areas and I
guess it in a one.
One thing that the
the geothermal industry
representatives were
commenting about is
how long it took
for than what was
originally called the sons
via utility
project to get
permitted
and so
that's in some ways back to
what this was about there
is also a little bit of
discussion
about you're trying to
do micrograms
so that if you do so you
wouldn't really have to
send it to
a a big
market I am more
local market would
be order
something to can consider
but one
thing I I just got back from
a
a general conference international
just or what conference in in
Reno Nevada in
in listening to
folks
there
they
are.
There's there's a lot of
of.
Wanting to
transmit these things to
markets to big
markets
and so I
actually had a conversation
with a person who's a
financial
person and nation
I say well why aren't you looking at New
Mexico and she said I don't have any
markets and a goal yes we
do we have Albuquerque
we have Los crucis we have Santa
Fe we have talents
in she didn't quite know what to
say
that.
Thank you so much for that
as senator and then
Dr Kelly
I guess that that actually
goes towards what I was
thinking as we're as as
I've and learning more about
I'll turn into the energies
and
how they're designed
to be marketed
to go out of state I
wonder I think about the
communities that
are
lacking in these
who pay higher
costs for energy
and I'm wondering
rather than just seeing these lines
go overhead them by passing
them we've heard about
the discussions about how
expensive is it to drop
a line but that seemed would
seem to me to be
from my observation
and limited time
with information
presented.
For to my understanding
that that would be one of the key
pieces that we want would be
to have this
generation
benefit
of our communities
and I'm fine with the
export of the
excess but I
think that and
it sounded.
Very reasonable
for me need to
add to see
that Joe summer thermal
of capacity
and.
Generation could benefit
local communities and I
rather come like that
idea
thank you
I think I'll hold my questions
on the rest because I think it be nice
to have a conversation a little more
deeply deeper so
thank you very much thank you madam
chair. Well
thank you all so much thank you committee
for your questions and and thank
you for being so persistent I
look forward to supporting this on the floor
again
and that we can start bringing this
into our state
for some jobs and
saving the energy and all
that. Happy
stuff. If I could
just make 2 quick comments
one.
The issue of permitting came
up and I I just wanted
to mention that the State Land
Office has also
joined us in some of our
discussions and
we're as federal permitting is
pretty complex
the state land office could
streamline the permitting
process and they're they're on board
with doing that they're willing
to make state lands
available for geothermal
of wherever it's appropriate
second COVID
at Dr Kelly's.
Conference one of the
presentations was by Los
Alamos national
labs and I
I was astounded at
the extent to which Los
Alamos
national labs is
involved in geothermal
research and and
and and
mapping and and all sorts
of things they
have a staff.
I would say 2025
people working full
time on geothermal
very little of their work is going on
in New Mexico there working
with Colorado there
working with Texas with you
to a with Arizona
and here we are if we
had this capacity
in our energy minerals Senator
resources development
department to make that link
up we could benefit a
great deal from their work
3 we had a workshop
at.
Thank you all so much for your work
we appreciate that greatly thank
you. All
right we're almost
there we have
now Jim Jordan
who is the executive director
of renewable energy industry
association of New Mexico
Jim is been an expert
on some of my bills I'm glad to
hear glad to have
Jim here to talk about
distributed energy
resources
then we'll finish off with economic
development
inTaos.
And then if we have public
comments we will have
that and
then recess for the day tomorrow we
meet in Los Alamos
at 9:00 in the
morning I'm saying
that more so to remind myself
than anybody else.
Arjun you're you're
up.
Okay thank you very much
madam chair and
members of the committee really
appreciate the opportunity to be
here in the great town of tiles New
Mexico
my name is Jim
Daschle data and as
Senator Hamblen mention I am
the executive
director of the renewable
energy industry
association of New
Mexico a lot of folks
notice by either
Rio or R. E.
I. A.
we were founded in
2004 we have
60 plus
members
our mission is to support
advance.
Support promote and advance
the transition to renewable
energy in New
Mexico.
And our focus
primarily is
on distributed energy
resources and so
just to put it in just kind of very
simple terms those
are smaller in medium
size renewable energy
systems so think
rooftop solar or
community solar.
We are very
active in the
regulatory environment so what the
public regulation commission
and also at the state legislature
to advance policies
that are favorable to our
industry and we're also
an affiliate of our
national counterpart which is
the solar energy industries
association they have a
nice office in Washington
DC And focus
primarily at the federal
level.
So moving on
to page
3
little bit about little
data on the state
of solar in New
Mexico.
According to see
a and that is again what
we're affiliate of on
I think this is 2022
data 2013
people are employed
in New Mexico solar
industry and by
the way I like to tell people that
people are industry they're not just people
on the roof installing solar we
have bookkeepers
and drivers and
sales people receptionists
and you know whole 9 yards
that any industry
has.
We have about
almost 2000
megawatts of solar installed
in New Mexico you can see
on their how much power that
provides and this is in the
state of flux as little as we're
talking there's an
office a number of large
solar systems being
installed in New Mexico
and lots of
of residential
commercial going
on little a being installed on a
daily basis.
84 solar companies
operating in New Mexico I also
think this is conservative because
there was a a number of
New
companies created out of the
community solar
act and will take
a little bit of a dive into
that and basically
what I'm gonna be doing in this presentation
as I'm gonna go over
what's going on now
some future stuff
and then some
you know possible steps
that we can take to advance
things so you see on
your next page here
of the solar growth
by sector in
2023
and by the way I think this is
really going to take off
because you'll see on a some
later pages I have
the inflation reduction
act is going to kick
in and that's really going
to accelerate
the renewable energy energy
industry general so I think
we're kind of people of her
that hockey
stick term why I think
we're we're kind of here and we're gonna
be going like that so we've been like
this we're about to go like
that. You
can see there's a fair amount
of diversity in terms
of the growth
manufacturing
installation operations
and maintenance is going to be
a bigger item as
more more systems
are installed throughout the
country.
What's the current situation
so we are in
a incredibly
transformative
time in the energy
industry and not just
energy also in
transportation.
And also this is all
going on when we
are
transitioning
to renewables and we're
also looking at building electrification
sold a lot of things are
happening
simultaneously
and we need to keep our eyes on
that. We
can now generate energy
at our own homes and
businesses and I like
in the store when I got out of college
back then if you wanted
to run it because some kind
of report on the computer you had it
handed off to an I. T. person
instead of doing it on your own
computer laptop and that was
industry I got in and
it was also transported because people
like to do it
themselves.
The energy transition act was
as most people know in this
room requires that
we moved to
80 percent renewable
energy by
2040 100
percent of
carbon free by
2045.
And we're on our way to doing
that.
One of the things that that's going to
require and you can see that's a
theme in my presentation
as a significant amount
of energy storage because
as was reference in
the previous presentation
just having solar and wind
alone is not going to do
it because you're not
generating at all
times so we need to build
a fill in those
gaps.
There's also becoming more
more what I'm reading is
an issue of large scale
renewables
because they take up significantly
more land
van Eck like a plant
like the San Juan generating station
that was just retired.
There are becoming
concerns of people not wanting
them close to them and I and
I get it so one of
things I think we need to think
about is how can we
put as much
generation as possible
in the built environment so
when I say the built environment I
mean your roof
at Walmart parking
lot
a roof of a
you know target or Walmart
everywhere what we've already built
let's take advantage of that
and put stuff there it's right
at the point of usage anyways
and there's going to be less I
think objections to
that.
You're gonna see a
number of mentions
about the
inflation reduction act
in my presentation but here's
the bottom line
$369000000000
being pumped into the economy
the next 10 years for
renewable energy and
climate change related
initiatives.
See that's huge
you also see on here there was
a recent announcement by
our governor that
43 percent
of new vehicle sales
are going to be electric
vehicles or I
guess I think sees a different term
like non fossil
fuel whatever by
2027
and we're nearing the end of
2023 so
huge transitions
are gonna be taking
a
fact.
The next page.
I have a little bit
about.
Distributed energy
resources
and I've already mentioned
you know what a distributed energy
resources but it's also
actually electric
vehicle is
a distributed a potential
distributed energy
resource.
Right now we have about
40000
actually it's probably closer to
45000 solar
systems installed in New
Mexico right
now.
And solar sales are
expected to triple
by 2030 legislative
again from our national
counterpart.
Right now and this is
also national figure
there's 2 gigawatts
of energy storage
installed in the United States
so I'm not gonna get into the
megawatts kilowatts
gigawatts.
But look at this the
Brattle group that's a high
end consulting group utilities
pay a lot of money for their information
they're expecting that
to go up to 27
gigawatts by
2030
so again huge ramp
up in the next 7
years.
Also during the same time
period their expecting
electric vehicles to go from
3000000 to
26000000
on the road so
that that's going to be huge
I was just talking to Tom
Solomon about the current
challenges of charging
our vehicle we had a conversation
about charging our vehicles why
we're here but so
there's going to
be.
Of that that's going to be a huge
thing that we're gonna be undertaken and we
have to be conscious
of that so
what this kind of comes
down to is we need to look at
new ways
of putting
power into the grid and
also taking
power are taking
power out so it's going to be
a 2 way thoroughfare
it's you know the one way
street for
for the grid it that those
days are over and we need to figure
out how to take advantage
of that 2 way
movement of energy a
couple things I'm gonna be talking
about our
storage on the distribution
system so instead of large
scale storage were instead
of storage with your home
solar system
a storage
system on a distribution
line where we
have distribution lines that
I'm currently maxed out
because there's so much storage
on.
Michael grids saw
something just a small
grid connected to another grid
we'll touch on that
virtual power plants I'm really
excited about in
vehicle to grid so in other
words your electric
vehicle has this huge battery
but that is basically a
battery on wheels why not
take advantage of
that.
The next slide is the California
duck curve and the
California docker
basically tells
us that because
the way that solar energy
work since a solar
system works best in the Middle
today when this the most amount of
sun and when we
have the solar system on our homes
and businesses the utility
looks at that as a
what they call a loss of
low so they're not really
looking at that as
generation they're
looking at that
as less energy
being consumed at that
site.
What this set
this
grant shows
is that in the middle of
the day we can actually
have too much solar
generation.
And that's a problem because
generation needs to
equal load we need to have a
balance between hot between
how much energy is
consumed and how much is
generated there's a very little
bit of wiggle room
on that.
We're starting to have issues there
conversely when the
sun is going down the solar
system's not generating as
much.
The man is actually going
up because people are going
home the turning on their air
conditioners and guess what
else is going to happen pretty
soon they're gonna start
charging their electric vehicles
so we need to figure
out how to
address that so
there's a couple things you can
do you can
curtail the
generation of those
assets so pumped
less energy into the system
middle today but
then you're all under utilizing
that asset so the
obvious answer
is to store that energy
for use at a later
time. We
do this already we have something
called refrigerator kitchen
we store food for use at a
later time on a
laptop the part tribes we
store information for
use at a later time so in this
case we're storing
energy.
Simply make
sense.
The just a few tidbits
about the inflation reduction
at because I think there's some
really good
things in here
that New Mexico can
take advantage of
so the.
The thing that our developers
are very interested in course is
the 30 percent tax
credit that get as
now goes into
2032.
But here's a big difference
government bodies
native American governments
nonprofits can
take advantage of this
with direct
pay so when I
was in solar sails
I can't tell you how many times
I had government bodies
I had religious institutions
I had not for profits want to do
so you I don't get the 30
percent federal tax credit
I'm sorry you don't
so some people did it anyways
but here you got the direct
pay. Okay so
that's huge there's
a 10 percent additional
tax credit for
systems and energy
communities and I
recently looked at a map
and most of New Mexico is
an energy community.
So we should bill
to get this.
There's up to 20 percent
additional tax credits
for systems that are installed and
low income communities
and there's there's restrictions
and on these
but those are just some of the basics
on their there's
also additional
tax incentives for
domestically produced
solar components one of the
big complaints about the solar
industry was
that most of
the the solar
panels came from
Asian countries.
That's a lot of folks know Maxine
solar recently announced
a plant just outside of
Albuquerque that's going to play
1800 people
this is a direct result
of those tax incentives that would not
have happened without that.
There's other incentives to build
out electric vehicle
networks upgrades
to home electrical systems
and building
electrification.
We talk just for a moment about
community solar
most folks know community
solar act was passed
I believe those 2021
it basically provide for 200
megawatts of community
solar.
So just like in a little update
I think there's been some of the presentations
and community solar
and some of the interim
committees so
at the risk of being redundant
all right there are the
bids have been a were
awarded.
All of them exceeded
the 30 percent requirement for
low income subscribers
so I'm really
happy about that and
by the way there was significantly
more demand than
200 megawatts was about
1500
megawatts bid
the statue
said there would be a
cap until the
PRC approved
otherwise 200
megawatts.
Most of these projects are in
rural areas
and quite honestly that's not an
accident land rural
areas is less expensive
the land in urban areas
but what that does is it
provides economic stimulus
to those communities
because yes
a lot of that equipment is brought
in but when people are working
there there are they're
spending money at local
suppliers they're spending
money at
local lodging and
they're also going to be hiring a lot of
workers to do those
projects.
A typical 5
megawatt project
and 5 megawatts is another
account that the statute
has is 25
acres of land so what I think is cool
about that is
important a lot of farmers
and ranchers 25 megawatts as
a kind of a corner of
their their parcel that's
not it it's not going to be huge
disruption in
the rural community that
this is going at.
The PRC is
expected to open a docket
soon on lessons
learned and
on the first tranche and they have
the authority to authorize
additional capacity so
we're hoping that they thank
you.
Moving up to the
rate on solar for
all grant
and this solar for
all grant this is
$7000000000.
Are requests there
merit based grants so
you don't just get
it.
It's by the
environmental protection agency
it was enabled by the
inflation reduction
act. Our
New Mexico energy minerals
and natural resources
department
is putting in an application
I believe it's any day now it's
required so that's
$250000000
and that's supposed to go to
residential solar
investment low
income and disadvantaged
communities.
So most of that's probably going to go
into communities to
help
incentivize community solar
programs and the deployment
of solar systems of residential
homes. As
was mentioned on the
previous panel
the ability and I think the panel
before as well the ability
to go after these requests
is limited by the resources
that we have so
I I I would urge the state
legislature to consider
that when they look at funding
various departments
because as I mentioned
there's $369000000000
of inflation reduction Act
money so we
want to get our share
in for New Mexico
and by the way part of the solar
fall grant is to do
workforce
development in the solar
industry.
Moving on to commercial
property assessed clean energy
so again this is all stuff that's going
on
now.
This was a bill
that did get signed in the
last session House
Bill to 28 kind of
flew a little low on the radar
screen and it was
called improvement property
assessment
act.
It basically what it does it's a
financing mechanism
to do low cost long
term financing for energy
efficiency water
conservation and
renewable energy projects in
commercial buildings
so. I
mean I've been in New Mexico now for 15
years there's a fair amount of
commercial buildings that I think could
take advantage of this
and one of the.
Things that's really unique
I think really good about this is
that census an assessment
it transfers with the property
so that allows to have
lower
longer term lower cost
loans
it's a white now we're at with
that is there's an RFP
out by the state
I believe it's Economic
Development Department but don't quote
me on that to look first
I contract administrator
so they can draw
up contracts that
can be used by the counties
because each county
needs to approve
this.
So if you have
any
influence on your County Board
of please consider
that.
I mentioned
the
energy storage on a distribution
line and PNM
actually has a proposal
to do one of these
projects
due to energy storage
projects so it's
at the PRC it's in a
docket the numbers on
their. And by
the way I I not I'm
not a spokesman spokesperson
for PNM but I did run the slide
by them and they said it was
it was okay with
them
so basically PNM
has a number of distribution
lines that
are I
I forget their actual
terminology but
essentially they are maxed
out with solar
so you can't put anymore
solar on these
distribution lines.
And what
this is designed to
do is
to
takes take off
some of that load and
then stored and then
dispatch at another time so again
it's energy stored but it's
on a distribution line
so this is
I think.
A a
unique way of putting
storage.
Of the line to help
assist in
alleviating.
Just the issues.
I mention microgrid
soul microgrid
is this
just like it says it's a small
grid it's an isolated
read but it's still connected
to the main the main
grid now
this is a more expensive
solution.
So it's not something that you
would probably want to do
everywhere but it does
have applications
I think and
hospitals police
stations fire
departments.
Military base
anywhere we where it's really
critical that we
keep electricity
going to the
facility there's
currently a microgrid at Kirtland
airforce base
just want to Santa Fe community
college
and we're looking to
help
others.
The next slide is on virtual power
plants and this is something I'm
really excited about
and there some test pilots
going on on this
concept
so the idea behind
a virtual power plant is as I
mentioned we have
approximately
40 over
40000 solar
systems already
installed in New
Mexico.
Unfortunately only one percent of
them has energy storage we need
to get that up to really
make this
a really viable
thing that we can do but the
idea is is that if
you could not work
these solar systems
together remember these are
systems that are
already there they've
already been paid
for by someone
else and so
if you could network them
together and you can
manage it so that a
utility could dispatch
that resource
at will when it's
needed for member we looked at
that will be called the California
docker which sold the
in the early evening hours
when we have the solar
systems are going going
down in terms of their production
but we need more
energy what if you
could dispatch this energy
at that time again
these resources already
there and
they're in place and
it also provides
resiliency so if the grid
goes down
for the folks that do have energy
storage.
They're still looking for a short amount
of time.
I. The
next slide talks about
a pilot program
that is currently in
effect on
this virtual power plant program
so this is in
California this is
just one of the programs by the way
but it's a collaboration
between sun run
which is the
largest
solar installer in the United
States also produce a a
remember and
P. G. and E. which is a
large California
utility.
And so what this program
does it's a pilot program so
it's only 8500
people and the
people who enroll in this
program have to
agree that between
the hours of 7 to 9:00
PM for 3
months of the year that
their energy is
available.
And they get a one time
payment annual
payment
$750
so as to essentially do
nothing just to
make their energy available
so this is I I like
this because it's real clean it's real
simple people know what they're going to
get and it's a real
monetary incentive for people
to have energy
storage on their homes and
businesses obviously
there would be some kind of tweaking
on this I'm
assuming.
But it's it's it's a
it's certainly a
start.
Another real big
siding thing in my world
anyways is something called
vehicle to grid
so. We
talked about that we're gonna go from
3000000 to 20
6000000 electric
vehicles on the road
estimated by
2030 so that means there's
going to be a whole lot of vehicles
they're going to have batteries.
So why have a
battery
in your garage few solar system
and then have the have a
TV in your
garage which actually has
a larger battery
than the one hanging in your
garage why not
just take advantage
of the battery that's in your
vehicle it's on
wheels so what.
And this battery so the
idea is is that you
would dispatch a solar
system to that
vehicle maybe during the day
and then at night you that
take the energy from the battery
and it goes back to your home
and or to the grid.
So it's the
technologies in vehicles
now the ability is
there to do it what we don't have
a state regulatory framework of
how does this work
and actually the coming
up the technology may have been easier
than coming up the regulatory
framework but it is
something that we
you know need to start thinking
about importing in
the rules and guidelines in
place so that we can take
advantage of
this.
Ellie got I think 3 more
slides ago so I'm
wrapping up.
So just some
challenges
some of this is going to be
redundant
but the one personal the energy
storage attachment
rate with solar systems
in New Mexico is
very low we're like one
low states in the country the
national average is about
5 percent so that means about
5 percent of solar
systems being
sold
nationally have
a battery
and when I first
got into the
laptop and desktop computer
industry something like that with hard
drive those ridiculous most computers and
have a hard drive so
obviously we don't do that anymore so
we need New Mexico needs to
catch up California's
around 12 percent Hawaii
I believe is over 50
percent.
So that's one thing is we
need to catch up and I'm gonna
talk about a cell
legislation I think on the next
slide.
This is just kind of a laundry list
of. As
a lot of folks know there's the
there's a solar market development
tax credit it's 10
percent tax credit
that up to $6000
if you buy
a our solar
system in New
Mexico.
Fortunately that is one out of
funding the last 2
years and
I can't tell you how much
I've heard about people
who were very unhappy and
I've heard that they've
expressed that with
their legislature
legislators even the governor's
office so
we are hoping
to have legislation to
increase that funding to
address that issue
in a way it's a good problem to have but it's
still a problem and we need to
address.
What I've already mentioned is
been read mention my other panelists
is the ability to
apply for federal
grants so it's
it's we don't want to leave money on
the
table.
I was at the legislative
finance committee meeting
I think a week or 2 ago
and I don't sales an eye
opener just reaffirmed
we are very reliant on
money from oil and gas industry
analysis the fact
and.
You know people minus we
think we need to transition
but I do believe that we need to
have a just an
orderly transition
so to something
I think about a lot.
Finally I would
be remiss if I didn't
mention of
this and it's not something I'm proud
about but there are
some people in the
industry that I represent
some bad actors
and I'm I'm just going
to say right here I am committed
R. one is ation is committed
to rooting those folks out
and we've had discussions
with the attorney general's office
and with other
people including people the state
legislature on what
to do about that but we stand committed
to doing that
there's a couple things I omitted
on the slide one
piece is
there was a piece of legislation
last year that
was designed to take
advantage of those
federal in
place reduction act funds
and that's a low income solar
act and so I'm hoping
that legislation will be
back and we can hopefully get
that
done.
So the next page
has
this was
a bill house bill
32.
It was a bill that
Rio was very interested
in 40 percent
tax credit for energy
storage systems with a
limit of 5000
residential and
50000 on commercial
properties there
was a cap of
$4000000.
And a 5 year
sunset.
As I mentioned New Mexico is
way behind the rest of the
country because we
don't have any kind
of
financial it's not
it doesn't make sense for person to
do it financially people
get energy storage now to just
do it because they want to or
if resiliency is very important
so this would be a way to
get out that this
did passed both
chambers and
unfortunately this was
also on house bill well
unfortunately was on house bill
547 unfortunately
about 80 percent of House Bill
547 was
a line item vetoed
including that
part of it so we're
hoping due to be
back
we are. We
have not yet we're hoping to have
conversations with the governor's
office on that as
well.
I think this is the last slides so
just real quickly some
next up I just
mentioned the energies
towards
system income tax
credit
updating the full market development
tax credit.
Number 3 is is
important and so that is one
way we can address
these bad solar marketing
practices is there
is legislation
that's in place called to distribute
generation disclosure Act every
time someone signs a
contract to get a solar system they're
supposed to get this
disclosure I
am suspecting that doesn't happen
a lot of the time and I think
one of the reasons is it's a very
awkward
and it's not
a real friendly form
so we want to update that
that's something we need to do with the attorney
general's office
we are open to all
other actions as well to
make sure our industry
is a good positive
energy industry for the
state of New Mexico
we want to work with the counties to
implement
pace.
Recognize the value small
stored vehicle to
grid
and virtual power
plants that's stuff that
could be legislated but it
can also be done at the public
regulation
commission.
I think I've already mentioned all the other
things so.
I appreciate everyone's
time and
patience and if
there's any questions
I am
open to an answering
that thank you so much
Jim I
do hope that you have.
Folks that you're
with in terms of legislation
that you've already reached out to
people you know because I
still am interested in the low income
solar act and.
I think that's really
important
so I hope that you've got people that you're
talking to about.
About that legislation we
do have Representative
Duncan
and you don't have to be hesitant about
it. And so that you
are.
You're good then you're good
anybody else I Senator
Ortiz Y. Pino.
Thank you madam chair.
That you know I'm kind of shy
no you're not.
So recently I was at a
1500 acre
solar farm
groundbreaking Revenue
cutting it should say.
And and
there are a couple of
issues that but I'm concerned
about where.
One I'm grateful that it's on the
backside of a bunch of
hills that that I can
see
I mean I I don't think that's very pretty
project quite
frankly so
2 items
I'm a little bit concerned about the
radiation.
With such a large large
plant
as I was there they were talking
about another
3000 acre plus
a couple of private
and make another couple of 0
acres of BLM so that'll
be another 5000
acres of farm
there's well
I'm concerned about the
the
radiation
even they admitted when I was
talking with them about the destruction
of the eco
system
surrounding
that that
solar farm.
I'm concerned a little bit about that
and and. I'll
say this in a in
a even
though I can't see a lot growing
out there and some of
the the our
state there is an
eco system there and so
I I think there's a good chance
that eco system will be
destroyed and then the
third thing madam
chair is
and I'm sitting here looking at these
and and we take a tour
around and it it takes us
a a quite a long
time to get around this this
farm what we can
do with those and where we gonna put
on
on this as well as the
5000 acre farm
that's probably has
a really good chance of getting bills
we're gonna put those when
they have past their
useful life.
Thank you madam
chair.
Thank you of of
representative Duncan madam
chair so
let me just kind of unpack
that a little bit
so I believe that that is the
San Juan
project right in fact I saw a
picture of that and is there was a
picture of the
new solar farm and then the
generating station in the background
and I believe
the people that own that
ranch.
Said that after you know a
fair amount of thought they decided this
was the best thing to do for
them they did
mention I guess that ranching was
becoming more more of a
challenge
financially
I'm first one not a scientist
I'm not an engineer
I've never I'm not
aware of any radiation
concerns from solar
modules.
So I a like I said
I'm not aware of any I've been in the
industry 13 or 14
years.
But you did mention something
and a concern that I do
share is that
and that's a perfect example
is that that huge
field I believe to
generates less energy
than that plant
in the background did when it was
going and and
that is just something
that we're going to
have to figure
out in terms of what is
the right place to site
these large
systems.
And the other thing that I
would mention to that
is one of the things that I'm
really excited
about is
distributed energy resources
because as I mentioned if
we distribute these
more.
They'll have less of an impact any of
our especially if we do
it on in the built
environment you know something
that's already there but I do
share some of your concerns on
that
however I will
I was just add an interim
committee is actually
a one of my favorite
places that I went to it was
a
agricultural research
and
ranching
facility by New Mexico State
University it was
8 miles off a dirt
road from
corona. And
that research facility
was in the middle one the biggest wind
farms in the United
States so there's
a lot of discussion about how can
we coal
locate
agricultural with renewable
energy projects and I think
that there's some promise
there
in terms of what we do
with.
Solar panels
and any other
equipment when they're done
I've all the big projects
are I believe they
have to sign
agreements that
they're going to re purpose that
equipment adequately
but I do share
with you the
concern of how we gonna re
purpose everything from
automobiles.
When this building when
the end of the life of this building
happens what we do
with all the stuff I mean
that's kind of in my mind a
bigger picture but it's it's something
we need to address all of
us to and and that
includes people in the renewable energy
industry.
Thank you madam chair I just
had an opportunity
to to
sit with the former
or the ranchers of that
ranch that
Sir my talked with Matt
word and the discussion
was had with them was almost
that.
It was not a great discussion
health coming from them
and they've these that
rents last year I was out
there last year and
and so as I talked with
them
they ended up
because the fight was going to be so
long and they were gonna lose that they ended
up walking away from and saying
we can't went
and so that's the reality
of it right there
and and we can all say that we have
to look for the good of the community
and the good of our
state
but I I sure like to eat as
well so
those are my concerns and I I
don't know that you and I can answer
those today
you maybe 100 years from now will
know if if
you know there's more cancer up
there as a result of
of this we might find out
that but I don't think we can find out
today thank you for your
presentation.
Thank you Representative US senator
Ortiz he Pino and Representative
Allison. Thank
you madam chairman and and
thank you Mr Dujardin for
The presentation
my question.
I had not heard
of behind
the meter that
BTM
the concept
before
so it
and then you're saying that New Mexico
has a very
small number
of home solar
systems that have
installed.
Storage capacity along
with it. Is that
because in New Mexico
don't we still have reverse
metering.
And so if you if you
don't use all the
solar you're generating and feed
it back in.
You basically you're saving
to the PNM
is paying you for it for
the for the electricity
and would would if we have
that with that cool wave with
behind the
meter.
Madam chair Senator Ortiz Y.
Pino thank you for that
question and and that's that's a
good question.
So first of all.
I apologize by using the
term behind the meter
but basically if
you have
entered if you have electricity
coming to your facility whether it's
a home or business you have a billing
meter and if you have your own
solar system
it's. Behind
that meter so it's on the customer
side of the meter so we use the
term behind the meter lot
but really we're talking
about
residential commercial
solar typically on a roof
although it could be a ground mounted
system.
They're a house okay there
was a new interconnection
rule out the public regulation
commission that we worked on with a lot
of other people from all over the
country to address
some of these issues
and it gets
a little complicated but the
way specifically that
PNM
classifies.
The way that they
reimburse you
for solar if
you have a solar storage
system that is rated
over 10 KW usually
when you do combine the 2
you're going to have a rating
of that larger
than 10 KW it makes
it less
financially
attractive.
Because the way they reimburse you
if you have a 10 KW
system or smaller they give
you full retail rate
for.
Any excess energy that you
generate and what happens is
you get you use that as a
credit towards a future month
where you might under generate
so let's say in the spring you
over generating you're
sending more energy back
to the utility that you're
using then
in the summer using erasing
the use up that credit
so I think
there is something
to that that because of the way
that you're reimbursed there's
less incentive for
you to have energy
storage and for
and to take another
example where we
are sitting right now which is kid Kerr
selectable coops
system that's is providing the
hard keeping the lights on right
now.
On their system because they have
a lot of solar on
their own system that they've
invests a lot of money and
you have to for the most
part consume
all the energy that
you generate.
You I don't know
the exact details but
they make it.
They disincentive by that
to the extent that you're essentially
going to
have to you have a storage
system that will
prevent you from sending
back too much energy to the
grid.
So madam chairman so
basically the
utilities and
and the advocates for
solar and
behind the meter are
working on ways in
which this can be taken
into account so
you don't have that
disincentive.
Yes well we're working on it
I I don't know if I would go sold
go that far we're having
discussions that is a
national topic and
as we have more more
solar on homes and
businesses they are
calm there
are places in actually
Hawaii is one of those
places where the
utility The Little Miss
can't take all that
energy so they have
to say okay great you can have
solar.
But you you can't Senator the
utility because we we
we have too much and as I
mentioned one of
the are
challenges that Italy has and they
have to do it as they
have to sync up how much
energy is being generated how much is
being used and they spend a lot
of resources to
do that to make sure that they have a safe
reliable system.
But no children
madam chairman.
Back up.
Students home storage
would be
to the advantage of
not just the consumer.
Because they would be using that
themselves later on at
night or feeding
it back in do they get
credit when they send it back
in. Hello madam
chair Senator Ortiz Y.
Pino so one of things
I mentioned in that
virtual power plant is that
concept but
see the problem is
if let's say you
have a solar system with
energy sources and I have one
and let's say my neighbor has one
those are like little dots
to the utility until
the likes big dots
okay so if you not
work all those together
so it's all those little dots
or become a big.then
you've got something.
And that's the concept of virtual power
plant so I think what we
need to figure out is how
do we harness
those
systems on homes and businesses
when they get energy energy
storage and that is the future of the
future is energy storage of those
systems how do we harness
that sold out it
is most
valuable not
only to the to the
person only the facility
but to the utility and to
everyone.
Thank you madam chairman thank you Mr
division.
Thank you senator Ortiz he
Pino representative
Allison.
Thank you madam chair
I'm also going to relate to that
question to the solar
farm we had a grand
opening on San Juan
of.
The power that is
produced is direct
current.
That is why.
You do not have any radiation
underneath the panels
cause direct
current flowing in one
direction will not
create an electromotive
force.
So.
Being that the current runs in one
direction it doesn't create
any field
and and it is safe
so.
Why do we see the
installations
that are being installed now only
like 4 or 5 feet
high why can't
we raise them to 10
to 12 feet and then
still use
the ground beneath it
as Grayson areas
since there's going to be no
radiation No
electromotive force
nothing to kill
of.
Living
things.
Madam chair and
Representative Allison
thank you for the question
is.
There's 2 things going on
there so
again I'm not an
engineer it sounds like you might
have more of an entering background and I
do but one of
the ways something
that was very
simply expressed to me is that when you do
a ground mount system
for every for the to
go up you need to go down a
half a foot to the higher
that I raise that system
the more I got to go down
and so that increases the
cost
conversely there's of
course issues with
mod and stuff and
so typically I think like
18 inches is some somewhere
in that area is kind of the sweet
spot of where
people mount
them that's basically
cost okay I
think also makes it easier to maintain
clean them but as
I mentioned because of what
the concerns that you expressed
more more people are looking
at this concert and
I forget the exact term
but it's essentially
having Ag or
cultural
coexist
with big solar fields
so that you can maximize the
use of land and then of course
also address you
know some of these concerns
okay thanks for that madam
chair.
My last question would
be I
have seen some installations
in foreign countries
like Japan for
example when I
saw the San Juan installation
it took up a lot of a
creates and anytime
you see solar farms
they take up a lot of acreage
but what they did in
Japan was
there's a walkway pedestrian
walkway between 2
trailer 2 train
lines and they meander
all over the place and
that's where they make their solar
installations so the
people that are walking
between the 2 trains would have
a cover and it also
was produce in the
of solar
energy my order
was instead of using
usable land space
we could be installing
all the panelists following
all the roadways
and still get
W. secretary of the
roadways
so. Yes
my thought madam
chair.
Thank you very much Representative I've
seen also where
solar panels are covering
in our case irrigation
ditches to keep the water evaporation
but also generating that
so I I think thank
you committee for your questions I do
think that there are things that
and Jim I think also it's
just there's so much potential
and what we could be doing
and it's really whether or
not we as a legislature
see that investment and
that we see that it's worthwhile and
that it's it's going to work
for for New Mexicans
in our constituents
so thank you Jim it's always nice
to hear from you and I appreciate all that
you're you're you're bringing to the table
so thank you so much thank
you Mr
thank you members the committee I really appreciate
the opportunity.
And we will see you soon I'm
sure. A couple
months all right
lastly we're gonna hear about economic
development
house.
And so we have
Christopher Larson who's the
director planning
committee and economic development
and then I want to spruce
my saying your name
right. Okay
come
up.
This is where I want to have the theme
music to the price is right
where people you know come
on down and
then Anthony Duran who is
the preservation director of the
Pueblo house I don't know if at the
end of the year here.
Fabulous.
So it is all yours
you've got us at the end of the
day.
So my apologies for that if we're
tired crabby
but I'm very excited to hear about what's
happening inTaos.
Madam chair and committee
members thank you very much for
upcoming details and inviting
us to us speak
I'll talk briefly about
the town and then turned over
my compatriots.
In your hand out I've gone
sort of quickly through the
demographics of the
town of Taos I
think what's worth
noting
is our populations currently
around 6500.
People 6595
our median age is
54.4
which I think is very
telling
and our average income is 30
a little over 30
$7000.
Going next to our
industry sectors
inTaos tourism
and hospitality is naturally
are our largest
economic driver much
to the chagrin I'm learning
from a lot of our
residents who would
prefer that we not have
tourists. And
that we keep house to house
and I keep asking what does that
mean.
And so I never really get a straight
answer
says I've listed
some of the other industry
sectors health care at
18 percent
education construction
public administration sort of
declining thing but
definitely tourism and
hospitality
this town thrive you
know thrives on
it. The
next few pages are some
data regarding
tourism and
the economic benefits
that it is brought
to the town over the last
few years
you will see we've
we've generated the number of trips
the number of visitors
in the average number
of days.
The page after that
is where from
where they are tourists are
coming most a
lot of them frankly
do come from Albuquerque and Denver
but we do have a lot of
from other states as
well on
that.
And then the third page
and economic
drivers.
It shows the it by
age dollar amount
spent income and education
level in the yes this to
city of our
tourists I'm
inTaos.
So really getting to the meat of it
the challenges and the
opportunities
that we're sentencing inTaos
right now
our biggest challenges affordable
housing staffing
to keep the restaurants in
our our tourist
venues open
as well as job opportunities
for our
kids
but having said
that you know there's some issues
with some of that
we have some great
opportunities on
the horizon.
One at one of
our.
Leading yes when a real
estate agents has
come up to me and several
occasions and said it just
feels like we're ready to
explode.
And I think that's an excellent
thing as long as we can manage
how we keep house
to house and how we
we grow.
We are currently working with the tass
housing partnership which is a
partnership between the county
and the town on developing
housing affordable
and below market rate
housing we
have several
developers will
one out of Albuquerque in
particular is
looking to not
only construct
about 240 below
market rate housing.
I'm here but also for
using a
a message from Europe
of prefab in needs and
would bring the plant on
site and potentially
account for 200
jobs
now. Whether we
have the people that to fill the
jobs are not as some
one thing but we're
certainly encouraging this
group to move
forward with
this.
Also in the middle of an M.
R. A. R. metropolitan redevelopment
Act Plan
is funded by the state thank
you very much
which we're hoping will not only
generate the
improvements for downtown
and the
whole downtown area
that also would
generate jobs
and people
improving their properties as
well. We are
also currently marketing
Accern a co marketing
with the cap task
County Jessica stern sitting
back there and I are
trying to work on up
opportunities where we can
attack attract
businesses
to the to the town
and the county as well in a
joint joint effort that
benefits all of us
we currently have several projects
under construction
that are helping but will
hopefully bring jobs
and as well as improving
the quality of life
inTaos.
And with that I'd I will
go on and on a name everyone
of them that I'll turn it over
to my
counterparts.
Thank
you.
Second there
okay.
Okay.
Right good afternoon everybody
thank you for having us
this
afternoon my name
is a loan of spruce and I'm the
tourism director for tells
Pueblo I
will open up and then I'll let
Anthony Duran take over with
the preservation
program as well.
And and I just wanted to
touch base with
how much of an impact
or ism is to the public community
here in this
region it's
definitely our number one
economic engine for the
tribe we
have a small gaming facility
but that's only.
A very small percentage that
actually pays into the community
in comparison to what tourism
does for the community.
At this point we see around
100 we see
around a hunt in 19
we saw about 130000
people come through our
gate.
And that's predominantly from
made to
October.
And so and then winter
toppers off and then we close
for 8 weeks either
February March or March
April depending on our cultural
calendar.
And so it's
definitely a a multi
tier economic engine
for us it not
only brings in
development into the
tribe.
With the gate receipts
that come through
directly from emissions and
goes into our general
fund to fund
other components of the
tribe.
But it also spreads
into the individual
and the families of
the of the public
munity we have
small shops that have been
operated for generations
since the early 19
hundreds and
people have sold their wares
inside of their homes
in order to make a living
and that has continued on
not only within
the last like 50 years but
literally from the early 19
hundreds and so
we've been able to.
Make sure that our families are
taking care of make
sure that there's
entrepreneurship happening
without even knowing
it.
And so there is a multi
tier inside the village
there is the shop
that will buy
those wares from that
particular artist
and resell or there's
the artist who actually sells
under their shop and
then there's the artist who sells
to them so
definitely we saw an
impact happen on our
community.
During the COVID during the
pandemic era all
of that went
silent
but I do want to say thank you
to the state
for implementing
the self
employed
unemployment for that time
that really helped
our community in a huge
way and I know a lot
about it because I got reassigned to
doing all of it sounds like a whole
new jobs that
come and so
within that after
coming out of pandemic and
working forward and
us getting the time to
really take a moment and
pull back
from tourism and not
having so many feet walking
through our home and it
being our own feet
we were able to really focus
in on
Tony's line of work
or introduce line of work and that
really came into preservation
ending knowledge and how
much we need to take care
of.
Essentially more so the multi
story buildings and also
understanding how our
ancestors took care of
them.
We you know in the
19
seventies we had a
preservation program that
came around and I've
learned this from Anthony is that we
utilize some a little bit more
modern techniques
but we what we've been able to do
with tourism
funds with state funds
is learn.
Different techniques and learn
what our ancestors did
and. Old seems
to be
better.
But we do realize with
tourism and
how much of impact it is is
that our
whole definitely needs to be
maintained and
reinvigorate
those pieces into the
community and we've been
able to do so with not
only the funding that we bring in
through tourism but the funding
that we've brought into the
state.
And so we've
definitely
seen.
The awareness happen and
we've also been able to
implement
educational tools for our
own tribal members
utilizing these
funds
and it's really brought the
preservation program into
the limelight
and so I'm thankful that we've
been able to limelight
these efforts so that
way I can continue to do
what I need to do as well
but we definitely see
you know we get people from all over
the world we have the UNESCO
status we have the national
historic status as
well. And we've
also been able that's why
past of the pamphlets these
pamphlets actually go through
UNESCO.
And so these are going
overseas and they're
going to our
partner cities that we work
with there's only
13 living sites
on the world heritage site
list and so we work
with them as well
and so we you know we definitely
know the caliber that
tells Public carries
and we know what an asset
we have not only it
being our home
and we're we're from but
also making sure
that we take care of it
so I just want to hand it off
C. thank you and handed off
to Anthony.
Thank you.
Thank you madam chairman
and.
The Economic rural
economic development board
for. Given
us the opportunity to
present another success
story.
From the state of New Mexico
with the capital outlay
of funding that we
get. We've
been very successful
and.
Particular
village.
I'm in charge of
making sure that the village
looks presentable
for all the people to
come.
And we do that by
having a staff of 10
people.
That have been working
since
2019 we work through
the pandemic thank you very
much I like
to think the governor
and our constituents
Conover Chino.
Bobby Gonzalo
Gonzalez in
all you guys you know this is
your project
and.
And I'm very grateful
that you. That you
are part of it you know there's
all kinds of people that are
part of law House
problem now you know
and I'm very proud of
that. But
we know we train our people
in C. P. R..
And on
the other ad hoc
late training like
operating chainsaws
to a.
Make sure they have a big
shortage of drivers
license CPR
training in.
And we also
give them all 3 percent
raise every
year so
I can retain my workforce
so that's been working very
well.
I do have like a
maybe a 98
percent on.
Return to work
the work force for you know
from year after year since we
started so that's a really good
thing and I'm very
grateful for the state
what a capital outlay people
and all you folks that are
here. Of
our villages getting green
the reason vigor
aided. And
you can see you can
see and we get comments
from our own people that we're
doing a good job
and we've been involved
with of
the of the
world with
the.
Round table discussions and
how to save of this
historical places all
around the world I've
been.
In touch with the people
from Saudi Arabia
Africa Germany
you know and they have all have adobe
buildings and they're
trying to do what we're doing
here and we're
setting the example
is what I'm proud of you know
what with your help of
course
and we we've been helping
families
a lot of this
houses
and homes are owned
by females
and they don't have
any errors to the property
so it's hard for them
to maintain
their ability to homes
that's where we step
in
we try our best to accommodate
the people you know so
they can re use the
house
we've already low relocated
3 families insight
table inside the village
area by fix
in on their homes
so that's another success story
you know we're
there is an ex it is like in the
seventies when
it came in and
made hurdles
and all that's what left our
village like
practically isolated
but now we're
finally starting to
get the people back
families back into these homes
so I'm very grateful
for that.
Of we we have a lot of
challenges a monument to
task we've
been.
Focuses on
mainly the exterior of
the buildings of which
get all the elements like
rain still
but the inside the interior
of the village is fine
there's no more extra
damage you
know we have
natural if you
implication going into
the to the
ability to which
our ancestors
and expense sisters
invented and and
it's it's like
a.
Maybe like the air conditioner
like a natural air conditioner
and we're trying to you were fighting
on a lot of stuff
about.
Of.
Thanks technology
is issues
of there's a lot of it
in those houses so
we're we're learning as we go
along you know we're teaching
our younger we hire
at least I
younger people
to go ahead and learn the
straight that
up
that our ancestors
gave to us so.
Thank you very much for
giving me the opportunity
to speak to you guys
and. I
hope that you will keep on
funding you know our
project and your
project
to make this another success
story you know economically
thank
you.
You want
us.
Yes.
Well I I appreciate
you know I I
you don't have to convince
I think many of us on
this this panel about the
treasure that is tallest
in the tiles Pueblo
my wife and I were able to
bring some
friends from Michigan
to your publicist thank you for letting
us visit your
home and and
be able to learn about that in your guys
were out there working they were
they were resurfacing the
church.
And our tour guide
Tyree
was fabulous
she might want to run for office someday
so I've talked to her about that
and and
one of the things that I think is really interesting
and and I go down this to talk
rabbit hole every night which is just
not a good thing but there's a
person from the
tells Pueblo who's like
highlighting the pueblo
I see and then
and I don't know was
name right off the bat
but.
You know I'm talking about.
It might be he's
like like spotlighting like
I live on the tiles Pueblo and this is how
we have lectures with this is
we don't have electricity
and he like spotlights that
like what it's like to live on the
public but
I'm grateful for for what you're doing in
terms of preserving just
your culture that is so
vital to the to the
cultural fabric of our
state and
so thank you for being such incredible
stewards of your
homelands and
wanting to make sure that those
stay protected
and long
with the traditional ways because we have a
lot to learn.
From that we had you know
talking about earlier we had
indigenous filmmakers
talking about
food and
the sustainable ways of cooking food
and growing food so thank you so
much you know
when we talk about affordable housing
it's all over the country
unfortunately is that we're we're
experiencing an
affordable housing housing
shortage and
so. Appreciate
the innovative ways that you want to
try and do
that houses medium
medium income though
is is actually a little bit better than
the New Mexico median income
is check 26000
so that yes
Madam. Yeah
and and you know the and
it's it's so I I do think
it's I'm excited
about what some of the questions
and Representative Ortez
once ask a question or
2 I don't know if anybody else
does
I'm glad you're utilizing the
the metropolitan redevelopment
Act that Representative
Ortez carried in the
house and I carried in the
Senate and
that we saw that that would benefit
communities all
over the state rural communities
that want unanimous
on the floor of the Senate I don't know
if it was unanimous on the floor of the
house but people
see how that that's that's
helpful and I think our
job is to publicize
and promote the things that are being
done that our communities
can benefit from because
often we don't do
a good job of saying
these I
programs are available and I I
think that's something that we're trying to
improve on but
Representative Ortez so to go ahead
and start off if anybody else wants us
to questions or make comments we were
happy to thank you madam chair
thank you so much for
presenting
I want to talk a little bit about the
destination stewardship
plan that
town the town of Thomas
is doing I think is is
instructive for
all of us who live in
rural areas that
have a dependence on
tourism for our
economies we
saw what COVID
did to the
economy.
We saw a little bit of what the
fire was going to do to
our economy you know and
I think these are the kinds of things that
we need to be prepared for
I think someone needs to turn off their
Mike. Some
feedback thank you
so for the benefit of the
committee and for those
listening the
time has engaged in a destination
stewardship process
it's a plan it'll be created
after a series of stakeholder
meetings in which we talk about you
know how to keep
house House right
May 10 grade again
we're we don't really say that
that's just mostly a joke but
you know I think it's
important that we
have these conversations because
there's a huge battle
right now in our community
around tourism
and the dollars that it
brings and the
displacement going to bring to the
people who are from here
and it's it's really
it is about to explode
Mr Larson and
it's not going to explode in a good
way unless we really
developed policies of the
state and local level to protect
the people who live here who
make this community
and committees accrued also
you know and Gallup all
around the state that makes those
communities that the
special places that they
are it's the people
it's the indigenous people the native
people from those places
and it's
and it's under threat
with the money
that comes in from tourism
and I I really
appreciate what you know the time of
house AT the state
89 percent of the budget
of the operating budget for the townhouse
comes from tourism so
when you have challenges like
wildfires or you know
or pandemics
you.
You have people who cannot get
paid our public service
officers right
so I encourage other
folks to look to all
of you to look at this I this idea
of you know how we
take a holistic
you know approach to
tourism and what the
people who live here need and
I think that the town of yes can learn
a lot from Taos Pueblo
and how you know
you you've been dealing
with tourism for a long time now
tourism is the you know
basically for your economy as
well right.
But I think that you've done some
things you know that
protect the people
in your community I'm sure
they're more think there's things that you can
do to to provide more
protections and more security
and all that and we we just
need to be talking to each other about
what that looks like
and last name to touch
a little bit on housing I
am a founding member of that house housing
partnership and we're really
trying to if you the reason
why we can't keep teachers in this community
or cops.
Firefighters
is because
it's. I
heard $50000 to buy
2 or 3 bedroom home
right and that same home
was
$200000 3 years
ago it is I
like I'm so
angry I want to punch someone but I'm
not going to because I'm a public
servant
it's it's not right
and and we're suffering
and our communities in the north are
suffering and all around the state
because this
because of this explosive growth
and housing and we need to do
something very
deliberate to curve it
so I encourage
all of us to be thinking about
how we can
increased funding for
you know for housing infrastructure
that that are municipalities
or counties are
are participating
in. Hello
to think about you know things like
second mortgages for
our firefighters and our
teachers teach
ridges.
Stitches I don't that's not a
word but like I think we need to think
about that as well we have a
health crisis and the reason
why people aren't staying or coming to
New Mexico's because they can't find a place to live
so this is all
a housing is economic
development.
Period so.
My rent is now over
thank you madam chair you're very
welcome Representative we did
have in Los crucis
a presentation
from.
Senator folks about housing
availability in shortage and
so.
That is that is
no stranger to this committee
we certainly understand that
anybody else would like to ask any questions
making comments
representative Duncan.
Thank you madam chair I I couldn't
let this
go.
I know you're you're baton like what
is it we're on our seventh presentation
your 7 for
7.
It may House great
again. I
I just.
My I I
do have common so when
you said that you were taking care
of the women that don't have
husbands kudos
to your and kudos
to creating.
That speaks.
I think that as
as human beings
what are Senators lookalike
and water with those look
like.
That tells and speaks
volumes about you thank
you.
Thank you representative Duncan Representative
little. Thank you
madam chair
I just wanted to say thank you
all 3 of you for presenting
today it makes me very
proud to come
from the Pueblo as well my mom
is ago agency as you know my
aunties but
all the things that are being done
here in the
community the
things that were identified during
COVID
rising to those challenges
and exceeding the
expectations
I just can't say enough it
I just want to thank you for
your service to the community
thank you for what you're doing for
the people of the
town of tiles or trying
to do it is
not easy
and I
could not agree more with
the issues that are being
faced in New
Mexico I to believe
that housing his is
infrastructure that is
so
basic
a need that needs to be
met but I think
you all for your service just
want to let this moment pass thank you
madam chair thank you
Representative and
as we as we finish up
today I I I
appreciate the
opportunity to
to understand that you know some of the
things we've had today is
that in some cases were working
in silos and we're not doing
ourselves any favors by doing
that and we've got other
folks who want to work with
other people and share
that information we
had a panel earlier
on indigenous filmmaking and
understanding the challenges of
that but also understanding that
there are some for silos that
folks are trying to move out
of.
And have to kind of navigate
their own tribal governments and then
there are other opportunities for people
to work together and
and and that's what I see constantly
I think throughout of our any of
our committee presentations that
when people see opportunities
that can help their communities
there's an opportunity
and there's a willingness to try and
work together and I think of
just the the knowledge
and the skills and just the
systems that you've got in place of
the tiles Pueblo and
also just understanding the working
because is the town of talus
arounds the talus bubblers
on the you know the outskirts of
it is like both of you are
beneficial to each other
right and so there always has to be
this opportunity to work
together and understand how
you can help maximize each
other's presence and
also value in the community
and and that's always like I think
what we're all striving for
is how can we help each
other out but also how can we
help up lift
our respective communities
and then our community as a
whole so I'm really
grateful for that you know I
was talking with Jessica and we've got some
opportunities
to help maximize the Rio
Grande gorge in just your public
spaces that I get to do in my
job very excited
about that and I'm thinking
about like marketing
stuff in PR stuff if you want to
hear it I I don't wanna give
unsolicited advice unless you want
to but I'm just thinking
about ways to uplift in it is
Mozart Gabriel on tick
tock so he's
been he's been getting up there I
didn't see how many followers he
has but Aaron pull them
up and I was like yeah that's the
dude
and so he's he's bringing more
awareness to to
the public but I think
oh my goodness how many followers you have
he has 136000
followers and
1.6000000
likes.
So.
He's a native rock artists
who lives to share
my culture is what
he says so.
He's great he's doing a good job
for you
but so I I'm grateful for
your for your comments and I think
if you want to chat afterward I'm
thinking about like PR stuff that
just kind I was talking about
but I I love that we all are like
willing to like we get
that our communities we
benefit when we when we work on
our communities that
are state also benefits and
that we've all got something to add so
thank you so much for
being here today we appreciate
you thank you for allowing
us on your ancestral land
we are very grateful
and we have
no public comment today
unless you all just want to just get up
and do
whatever
otherwise. I
think that would be a free for all in
some cases in some other
committees
at this point we are going to
recess we will be back
we will be in Los
Alamos
tomorrow.
Okay you do need to hold
on you have
public comment.
Is it a cot is a question that you
can ask an individual or
you want to presented to the
committee.
How about if we do that after we
agree recess you can
come up and talk to me and if I can't
answer it all directly the person
again we're in Los
Alamos tomorrow we are at
the Los Alamos.
County
this.
City council chambers at
Los Alamos
so until then we recent we
recess until
9:00 tomorrow.
