discussion with our credit union

And like I said i'm not upgraded
regular participant at the sand
of a farmer's market and has
been actually for with
new mexico food and a policy
council as well so um.
Well
thank you again for there's
opportunity to speak with you
today i'm and workers.
morning all of which point to
the fact that we are not fully
serving are the demand that's
there for.
The small business support small
where they live including in of
the urban areas for instance
like the international district
or the south family of elbert
agriculture we need additional
support in making the ad
adaptations to climate change
and to lend support for those
support we know that we have the
various
forecasts of declines in a
revenue for the state that
firehose of funding coming in
now especially that we heard
from mfa that's coming in for
designated for small business
development.
it's not all focused on the
smaller businesses that were
talking about.
Or that we're particularly
focused on
number four whole the bank
support we are especially
focused based on the needs that
we have identified and our data
collection and community
conversations around the state.
smaller tribal and level members
and our underserved urban areas
and we're talking about
credit unions we want to help
make that possible.
I do want to point out that
the bank have north the code has
been brought up period several
the whole country and it's a
part of what it to them having
the lowest unemployment rate at
the end of the
the point about a security for
the banks the bank of north
dakota has taken the lead in
statewide system of making that
work and making that possible
that has happened with the
leadership of bank of north
dakota
There is a bank gap in the
lending support we have
identified that.
And that gap is closing about
with some of the federal funding
the interest and my
understanding is that money will
stay in the state but that's not
going to be available it's going
to be like a revolving fund or
go back into general seventy
So a minimal investment and and
when i'm on a highlight about
the difference here between a
the capital that's that it
starts with for instance if it
starts with ten million dollars
and yet have moved deposits from
the two to nine billion dollars
in any one time if we moved
thirty five million from any one
of those waller street banks
times that amount for lending
power because it's a bank not a
revolving fund.
were not talking about the bank
setting up partner loans with
hire high high risk or talking
about what can take the edge of
lower amounts and and we're
looking at fifty thousand
hundred thousand two hundred two
hundred fifty thousand for some
of those smaller sized
No other state agency can
leverage funds to that extent
state funds are the state
revenue is going to diminish we
And assumptions tested that we
can prove a bank of public bank
The one of the questions was
asked about how old the
borrowers access loans and
that's identified in slight six
or the community bank the
borrower goes there the borrow
has no contact with the public
bank new mexico because the
various types of blowns that are
input from the legislature input
from the community is input from
input from the banks and the
or other factors that are
happening and those are pulled
it in to be able to stretch and
share the risk in a different
way
increase in
rate of the lending and if we
look at the model over the bank
of north accounted they've been
I want to check here.
And just highlight that all of
what are we not supporting now.
I want to also highlight that
the.
original proposal which was to
instead of a fifty million
capitalization to move to a ten
of the state to do more and
depth work and develop advisory
councils in those regions to
go into more depth in
I just think for the mitigation
of risk in there but being able
to expand them we're talking
about still having strong
banks we have strong small in
midsize businesses and that's
what we want to support and we
want to
slow those
drying up cycles that have been
happening and in a number of our
communities.
Hmm.
The.
At.
I also want address a couple of
points quickly that we're
mentioned earlier
in our original legislative
proposals we talked about very
strong governance models that
us the members of that board it
would be
um it would be
an independent body but it would
state the economic development
secretary of that board.
In terms of regulatory
oversight.
Um
It doesn't make sense to be a
member of the f d I see in fact
the f d I c is saying that it
probably will not have
membership of the public banks
that are being created around
uncoverage for the insurance
but.
What we do now is that um
the public banks that are being
both their state charters and
also federal reserve because
we're all talking about access
to the federal window and other
process of their oversight of
the bank
there are a number of
public state public banks that
are in process
hired the ceo there in the
process of getting approval from
the for the four bodies that
make up that bank municipal and
county bodies
that city counting combat less
angelos and um
and also san francisco so there
washington state this is an
older study
john and the um washington state
proposal massachusetts as well
under way.
With their anticipate has just
received a
gotten a study uh turned in the
and I didn't mention color
router there are also
moving forward with theirs and
have its legislation written so
um
considered and the impetus
behind all of these has been to
help us bring back more local
focus on local economic
prosperity
there we have a examples of two
people that we've spoken with in
the last several years who both
we're not making loans to
local businesses right now or or
we've stopped making those loans
and
even though they've been
That in terms of of what we know
in our data without going deep
into the numbers again
in terms of our community banks
and
well commercial bank support.
Their fdic reports quarterly
report at the understood
participation in agriculture
loans and the young
small business lending if and
some banks do none and where
Not working cap at all not
not other phormism support for
the the businesses so
a strong contribution that's
made in my own family.
Of origin in the midwest my
grandfather in nineteen forty
was approached by the bank
this one truck that you invested
in and we lived thirty miles
from a moment on nebraska you're
keeping it busy and.
And my grandfather tapped into
that and took advantage of that
and it grew in to a significant
community banker can make built
when those relationships in
trips that are strong and that's
what I would like to see with us
that the state bank state public
able to share some of this risk
or mid a great gate some of the
risk so that we can were fully
support small business
participating in for presenting
here both in the chamber and
also online uh most grateful for
that so far I have
representative dunkin
The.
Representative little so I will
as always give a heads up I do
want to try and keep at least to
committee make sure your
questions are straight into the
point
and for the panel also try and
have your answers straight into
the point so many go ahead and
start off with representative
I remember when I walked into a
local banking I i'll even tell
you the name of the local bank
when I walked into elsewhere ago
and said we're going to start a
business and they said great
there's the door hope you're
successful
That happens we all know that.
I also remember selling my truck
in order to pay for my
employees.
Wages.
So I bought into it.
so I know it's tough and I
appreciate what you're doing
having said that.
Couple questions and then i'll
i'm intrigued why you are not
taking a position by the way and
a local bank or this state
endorsed banks can someone or
maybe all of the answer that.
score of six fifty k i'm in that
marginal group i've got a credit
score six six fifty so what's
the difference between my credit
union my bank or the state.
question that's an interesting
question unfortunately may not
be that simple because it
probably depends on each
institution's individual
policies what parameters they
the only thing i'm not aware of
any immediate regulatory
prohibition either they're the
fdac who is our regulator or the
ncua to prohibit anything in
Thank you madame church if is
that a do most banks and in
credit unions kind of follow the
same thing if I walked in with
at eight hundred credit score
are we gonna be looking at the
question I think are bank
there's a lot more to it than
just the score some people can
have a six hundred credit score
but we look at what that would
be in tales and what's in there
handling things right.
Since so they're trying and
that's really what we're trying
to do when we initially meet
somebody is whether these people
they had a in the and if the
business plan made sense.
Um and then if they had twenty
percent capital to go in or if
we could use an m f a or
somebody to help with that
yes they credit chair and and I
think that goes to my point if
if I walk in and I I have a a
low score or I have a high score
it doesn't really matter as long
as i've made my payments on time
same rules some of us are here
are some of us who here and and
so I just wanted one hundred
touch on that can you tell me
the distance representative I
think you'd also ask pose the
representative dunkin the one
caveat that I will say is that
credit unions have a defined
field of membership and so first
and foremost that member or the
of each of those business owners
depending on that again the type
of business with the asking for
and and what that credit needs
fell to membership is.
lending radius that you reach
participating i'd be glad it
discussed has specifically again
lend in new mexico period that's
our that's our lending area and
being one branch in albert
brigade that tends to be in the
area surrounding albert you know
lost almost down to believe that
something that's out of state
ordinary jason state critics may
be different but I don't think
so.
A bank would just have to
outside we don't do that very
often but if you document it the
fdic is just making sure you
know what you're getting into
and why do.
The.
thank you madame chair this
representative we love arizona
we love our local customers in
new mexico and we're basically a
two hundred thirty million
dollars and assets in two
thousand and twelve today were
over eight hundred million in
assets we just have locations
Think manager
my bank keeps telling me the
same thing thank you
the last thing
i'm sorry i've forgot your name
Madam chair representative
dunkin
what is being a discussed in
multiple sites in the public
information from the update I
see that there would be a
similar to bank of north the
coater with good faith in credit
You know no holds barred and no
guard rails on tracks.
But that the backing would be
under four percent and on other
loans it's under two percent
last generally year tier and
that's below though national
Thank you representative
representative lundstrom then
representative montoe
representative lawn and will
continue on with that list.
Thank you madam chair i'd like
to start by thank you.
panel but I I guess my first
stop servation is is there
really a gap and i'd like to ask
what's in those balances
currently and who is on your
waiting list to get those loans
i'd also like to see from the
public bank advocates the market
that's coming from I think
there's the other thing that's
curious to me bottom chair yeah.
This isn't by the alliance for
local economic.
Thank you madame chair i'm
looking at the page where it
talks about what the banker say
in a f l e p response
is the chartering authority and
the bank will follow the same
rules that all banks in new
mexico do it will be examined
audited comply with the same
regulations and schedule annual
that means that there's certain
things that you have to comply
with and if you comply with
those things that means it's
going to cost something so my
grant to businesses it's a loan
to businesses and their certain
certain requirements that are
going to have to be followed
does don't get to be changed a
state chartering process means
of the day except there's not
going to be insurance available
for those deposits
that would be something i'd be
interested in madam chair
because that hasn't been clear
that agency over the last few
years who's on the waiting list
how many people have you got
what's those balances look like
and why isn't the money getting
Would be sent to erin and then
erin will send it to the entire
committee so I appreciate that

possible.
I'm a realtor and my wife's been
a realtor for
It appears to me the whole
purpose for a state bank.
Is because.
There are.
Manor chair representative
montoria.
The.
relationship with that
particular bank and that's the
low and that's going to
be a best fet for them it may
also be that the type of balone
commercial bank may have been
lending so it doesn't
necessarily mean that they have.
Been turned down for a loan that
they are actually.
That seems to be the reason for
creating.
A.
A state bank because the other
folks are already being served.
to local credit unions and.
Also looking at national
lenders.
I'm getting a much better rate.
I'm a member or my money is
there so part of the ability for
me to tell money even though
i've never or two to borrow
credit score matters
but that relationship matters
the history matters.
What i'm concerned about is
Who
have visited or looked into.
The.
I think i've looked into eight
lending institutions up to this
And not worry about no matter
what i'm gonna pass with flying
colors it'll be easy.
That I believe is why in north
dakota
me so for as i'm looking for the
best rate i'm looking for the
best and in the quickest and the
easiest way to go I I can see
And a couple of years ago what
we did was the we essentially
shut down the payday long guys
we just shut down the guys who
we shut them down because the
rates were high so now people
have returned back to what was
going on before they're taking
household items and pawning
them.
Because they still need the
I don't want to have three fewer
options in my community I want
to be able to have the ability
would call sub prime lending
we're putting it risk.
And and and also making it state
government has already been
through sub prime lending.
And it was already been a
debacle it's already failed
miserably.
And the government was on hook
That's the problem here is if we
go down this road.
And our local options go out of
business because they have a
rigorous standard.
And the state doesn't have that
borrow money and we're limiting
it eventually potentially to one
source that that is a huge
concern for me
we we that this history madame
chairman of the end of my
miserably and it was a national
crisis new mexico's a small
state a small budget
comparatively to all of the
other budgets in the nation and
representatives are more
representative allison and
representative little I forget
anybody

ma'am chair
you just buy a show pounds maybe
who is here representing our
banks.
And who is here represent our
credit unions and who is
representing
our state bank.
information out there but from
what i'm reading and and
gathering from the years that
i've been able to serve even
before the you know my question
two goes to what the gaps are
but
great so you know we're hearing
a lot of different things a lot
of different concerns and that's
where we're having these
conversations but
I mean I think the bottom line
from you too as i'm listening
concerns of of my colleagues as
well and would that means and I
might miss a piece of
reading and and listening
so my question is if we
regular banks are maybe even
credit unions.
Failed because of it because
this was doing well as a zap a
I'd like to ever respond and
maybe others madam chair
representative lohan.
I don't see the bank we're
dakota those twenty one banks
that closed closed in nineteen
in the nineteen twenties not now
they haven't forced out those
per capita community banks to
population is the highest in the
country in north dakota so that
means they have a thriving
banks about closing them
affecting them is that if the
public bank becomes strong and
because they are getting a
better rate of return.
And that's a part of what didn't
happen in
because those deposits have
removed
and so I just want to clarify
that and that in there not
making sure
loans.
matter of chairman could comment
in north akoda the bank is the
disclosure for the state and
presented to the legislature
several years ago
for saw the piss possibility of
the bank of new mexico becoming
the fiscal agent and the
an incredibly sophisticated
system in place and you could
ask any of trd or dfa or h d or
any of the other agencies that
that may be panel what you were
talking about.
Madam chair representative thank
you for the question and and
that you're right that is that
is a definitely concerned and so
Shortly after that within two
years it was under capitalized
so what happened was the
legislature met and an under
legislative act.
They required all municipal
here so when we think about
community banking in our
communities I I go to like a
city like large burger like
large where we just have one
community bank in that
community.
Okay but i'm chat think you
you know i.
We can pay a lot of information
and I just would say we're
talking about about the risk in
are banks so I just want it in a
preference that also say that
you know we're more talking
about communities at like
lordsburg in these really rural
communities.
is a balance but I also think
that the the premise also of a
free market in and competition
is healthy because then that as
think we're still getting to to
what we need to be with us
but also I would madame chair
something that struck me very
climate change and to create a
twenty year plan for a new
mexico economic development I
think that this is and I just
say this for all of our
panelists this is something we
need to all be looking at where
in our budget to to address this
very issue and I think this is a
very significant significant
point that we are going to have
Mary chair
of our wor I think all of this
are aware of the legislation
chavis marty chavis on this
issue
in is understand it
there'll be something the
introduced this accession so I
wanted to make you aware of that
been basically organized we're
looking at that is as all of the
banks are aware of it and so at
looking at the amount of money
that's going to be asked for to
basically get the the ball
rolling with regard to the green
bank and that's something that
that we understand exactly what
are going to be the requirements
the costs and what not and so
that's what we're where we are
right now in that
thank you manager do you think
in these gaps in the access
because as we know you know one
of the issues we have now is we
are moving through our eta for
our state is that we need to
have more access for the
industries in our green
conversation how are they able
to meet that the the moment that
we're ran right now you know and
we need a from my perspective we
need all these resources manter.
question are being serviced by
our bank's currently
the the question really comes
down to the sculpt of what's
going to be required and ask of
a lot of.
Pressure put on us to to
basically participate and I know
these end of the gentleman and
probably have some comments but
if you want to chime in to go
ahead and raise your hand and
will go ahead and but if if we
don't see you you're also
welcome to just say a madam
we are we need to meet the the
the time in place that we are
right now and there are so many
needs and so many advantages to
because of where we are in our
banking regulations and all the
sort of things in the gaps that
are needed that we are not going
to be completely there to meet
the demand of the need that we
you are going to participate
with us thank you madame chair.
Thank you representative and and
she brings up a good point that
if there are things that are
the committee gets it and so I
know that there are some times
where you're like oh wait I i've
got we all have that after a
fact after the fact the moment
so want to go ahead and and open
representative representative of

a whole little that this is
going to actually fail you know

other way you know I mean it's
historia thanks for the story my
dad told when he started in
business and artisan nineteen
forty seven he went not and now
named their banks I don't think
Of course my dad wasn't quite as
easiest and so he just walked to
cross the street to the that
time as people state make an

to me that there is and that

i'm a stirt of the state's money

I have banked my whole life
might primarily first loan it I
got was when I was like sixteen
years old to buy a horse.
Back then we used to do a draft
And it was really nice way to
bank but as we grow
it gets a little more
complicated we all know that I
banked was several bankers in my
lifetime
And they understand they've seen
the loans happen they've seen
people go broke.
But getting off that.
I don't like that we get
compared.
There's different regs and
legislation up there.
Our state i'm sorry but we
haven't been friendly to small
business.
In a smart business needs money
here today.
And not supported our small
business why didn't we shut down
the big businesses because there
could be too many people in
there and have our small
business carrier the load and
And thank you for coming in this
chamber.
Love aside on south philly no
same price representative.
None and also your name or none
of the union's embassies.
And you get nervous you should
see me when I first came in
these chambers
and pretty nervous.
But thank you for coming out
today.
But for little I heard from you
it's probably a story of a bad
relationship between a banker
and a customer.
you go to the next banker
I have a similar story as yours
represented dunkin.
I went her banker and they
refused me.
But that's that's that's part of
the characteristics of banking
is you go to the next bank.
It and thanks thanks to gather
kind of the loans that you do
you need it but to go to the
next bank.
And if we need community banks
in in rural new mexico let put
Members of this.
Legislature so many times I have
made the statement why do we
better for them we don't have to
kill.
A gas station in in my community
because he's not following the
regulations.
It happened to me in my
district.
And I and I pull this certain
business out of this whole.
Mental health resource center
over there.
We're gonna build a new one so
we can kill the old one and what
the old one needs is beds and
To give them the beds at the
hospital and work with them to
make it all work instead we're
gonna kill the existing mental
health resource center.
We as a government body.
Need to wake up to these things
if.
banking community that supplies
all our banking needs here in
the state.
In the state bank was to step up
and take over.
We know we don't where you've
already lord your ask from fifty
million to ten million you're
saying you need seven hundred
million.
Not think everybody can not
their head to that.
And it'd be yes and there's a
gap down on the lower end also.
back because there was no way
that she was ever going to pay
it back.
We know there's some issues with
the banking industry.
But we don't need to kill the
That they want him there.
Is that goes broke.
He'll he'll have a heart of
time.
We're not gonna be successful as
a state i'm sorry.
There's too many people go broke
there's percentages that
going to say a percent on that
first year.
Those are the numbers that i've
heard in the past.
We need to look at those things
no answer young ladies are
forgot to name I have a bunch of
names here and III i've made the
mistake of calling people by the
wrong name before and it's it's
bank you could feel those voids
do you really believe that the
state and new mexico needs an
unregulated bank.
Thank you madame chair if it's
When you are going through uh I
believe page nine and you made
the statement that been an
unregulated bank that you could
fill those voids and make those
loans.
cash flow lender and that as a
result of who we are in how
we're governed the statute that
that you all pass to create the
nmfa that we're able to provide
loans that are made and if we
were regularly to buy the same
entity we'd be unable to advance
the cause any further so that
was the point I was trying to
come in and help support bank
more bank landing and that's
that was the point I was trying
to make I hope I answered that
question madam chair
representatives are modern.
Thank you thank you madame
Are behind closed doors.
A lot of the issues don't get
brought up.
There's ways to to get a bill to
And there is always been
the loaning question behind
closed doors in between
legislators.
Ma'am
does this have anything to do
with canabas and canada's money.
we don't touch the cannot bunds
besides out this isn't a retail
bank it's really strictly
I hope it doesn't there's
there's a lot of people.
That don't support cannot be
seen though even though I got
past.
Uh.
the canous industry to a certain
extent.
I hope this bank doesn't have to
do with canada I hope we don't
find that down down the road
that that were.
We heard some that testimony
couple days madam chair.
And it's it's interesting that
you know how how the pieces of
raving no one and maybe i'll
come up with some more questions
thank you thank you very much
representatives and more we have
representative allison
close to my home in a border
town we have major banks and I
believe public banks in addition
to that we have several credit
unions as well
vehicle or one of my vehicles I
was asked if I lived on the
reservation
I really didn't know what they
had to do with my purchase of a
vehicle
And then when I told them that I
work in the mind industry all of
a sudden all of them wanted to
find that's my vehicle
the institutions that
try to help small businesses and
things like that
just a question of sovereignty
just wonder how the sovereign
status of nation's effects
institutions like that thank you
madame chair.
The.
Thank you chair representative
allison
don't know all the deep down
interest of of the legal side of
that but I do know there are
some concerns about
through the fdic or the federal
reserve in regards to how their
examined by those institutions
and how that asset is securities
so there is some some issues
there.
in my nearest community of
chiprock there is a wells for go
branch office but I do not see a
public banking branches on the
and and probably that is for the
service side of things as far as
offering checking accounts and
things like that i'm not sure of
what type of lending was fargo
does
Manager are representative
you raise one of the more
complicated issues that
uh
its own uniform commercial code
which should in
in fact differs from the uc here
we have our state there are
institutions are very
frustrated by not being able to
land as much and in the have a
hole in the liberal nation but
will come to gallop grants or
whatever and and purchase a
vehicle and that in the sounds
make some of the banks more
there is as I said I think it's
a very good question and it's
been one that has never been
really resolved though that much
in over the many years that I
represent the banks
representative allison
representative little and then
representative.
Think you madam chair and thank
you members of the panel for
presenting this morning I really
my questions many many questions
were answered and I appreciate
that in the discussion that came
from that um I represent the
generally independent
contractors and looking to grow
and with them in mind I am
wondering and was quite curious
would welcome them to come in
writing through errand as
manager suggested my questions
my question is.
you couldn't support it while
you were opposing it my question
is for the considerance that I
have what are are there plans to
going to until we get different
information and I am open to
receiving other information but
i'm wondering with the gap that
if there are plans that the
associations have begin to
consider when will they be
complete and to whom will they
be proposed how will this be how
those would be the two pieces
what plans are there and what
are the timelines and again this
may be a much deeper
conversation and I just
since i'm an albuquerque if you
are maybe best situated to kind
of attempt to answer that
question just one general point
we don't we may differ slightly
that we don't.
small business for various
circumstances more often than
not the challenges is it's a
start at business without any
historical cash low perhaps
there's a lack of collateral or
department for the cap program
that lateral asset program where
they pledge a cd to the bank as
collateral for fifty percent of
the loan program and so we
department we have and we will
engage in mexico finance
authority as well there's no
question there we engage the SB
a through the space seven a loan
program or the SB a five or four
collateral and no equity I would
suggest that perhaps alone is
not the right vehicle for them
to start a business perhaps
equity is more appropriate.
But i'm sure thank you.
questions you're welcome to do
so.
Looks like it will be a follow
up thank you madame term thank
you representative thank you for
that
that there was a way to reflect
that in our minutes I just want
to see that because
I followed pretty much all of
I also want to say um
hello out to harold dixon and I
want to think angela mercury for
guess first I wanted be
transparent I sit on a board of
directors of a credit union in
alba cookie I have for the last
thirteen years and i've been a
name I own a small business in
albacorky it's very very tiny
small but i'm proud of it
because I opened that business
when I retired
so having said that matter chair
and panel
you know we look at financials
every month as part of that
operate we operate because of
our membership.
And we're always trying to get
members I mean is easier on tv
such in such a credit union
trying to get members and here's
decided on this issue honestly a
I keep going back and forth but
one of the issues that I do have
is with regard to state wealth
stated and I wished I could
speak and spanish the way that
you do so I will be taking
lessons from you representatives
that I have not heard in this
discussion and maybe I hopefully
will get some information
regarding this is we have
predictions about our state
venture and madam chair i'd like
to maybe somebody call me or
talk to me about this because
right now I don't see that
over ten billion dollars in the
oil and gas industry is booming
but what happens when that
doesn't happen what happens when
our revenue I was on the period
from.
You know fourteen billion two
overnight seven billion dollars
and it just like I should really
have white hair right now
more comfortable knowing that.
If the state was doing these
small investment or the small
loans to people who
are we going to be able to
sustain that as a as a state
over time
and then the other thing that
credit union we review loans
every month
I know that we there are loans
that default on a regular basis
if the state tax payers picking
up that bill and are economy and
our
state wealth goes down down
programs like west and other
programs that we've you know
that are out there a small
business administration
for me is the risk that's
involved
um
credit unions and there are some
credit unions that have the cdfi
program and they have to apply
competing with credit unions
so those are some questions that
maybe if you want to.
Call me or talk to me i'd love
to hear from you.
Thank you manager
to represent a divergo
i'm actually a constituent in
your districts i'd be glad to
follow up with you and more
years for the bank and in the
current proposal we're showing
about a seven seven point three
percent I think it is in the at
but
yeah but.
We were not talking about
continuing to come back to the
then deposits start to be moved
into the bank
then down the.
Money is there to leverage for
the lending possibilities of
what other states are doing as
as well with the plans for.
In you know incrementally
building up their deposits thank
on membership and so I would
really like to have that future
discussion with you thank you I
think there was a response
crystal thank you chairman
mountain chair and and
capitalization of ten million
and then thirty five million
deposits but the financial show
a half a billion dollars in
transfers of deposits and five
years.
So it's not.
And so it's not capitalizing in
taking thirty five million
dollars in lending three hundred
and fifty million dollars you
don't leverage you can't
leverage thirty five million
dollars deposits ten times.
That are collateralized and held
for the long term or the
duration of that long so there
is inherit risk there and.
That's that's some on the
comment
I don't know if you want or if
think this is an opportunity to
get more information which was
the purpose of this panel was
for us to gain more information
and be able to ask questions and
also to get folks in the room
appreciate you being here in the
chambers thank you for coming
welcome and I hope you will not
be a stranger
to this because as
representatives and more thank
you very much for for offering
are welcome to go we've got some
business to take care of but
thank you all for your time and
for what you do in the
communities and appreciate you
you taken that time to be here
today.
interim season there are five
bits of legislation that we are
going to go ahead if you do want
yeah i've got it yet got it
alright so thank you so much
appreciate you
thank you so much all you take
here
representative montoyan
representative allison raising
awareness of the economic
challenges experienced by the
four corners region uh then we
have three bits from senator
diamond brantley she's fine with
myself a coasponsoring one bit
of legislation representative
goes vice cheer gagas represent
corresponds to in another bit
that martin is the one who
drafted this so he is available
for questions uhm so we just
want to make sure martin you
have a microphone you don't have
to go down there if you don't
want to just have a microphone
questions and then ask for a
motion to endorse so I you've
had you have the information
there in front of you i'm gonna
just go ahead and go through
really quickly representatives
and those who oppose will be on
record as opposing okay that's
good thank you matter we'll just
do i'll do emotion to a motion
to adores have somebody
this information in front of you
this is the catastrophic
business relief act this would
be through the new mexico
finance authority after much
conversation with martin
in unintentional connection with
anti donation so martin
researched it talk to john clark
at EDD
economic development holder into
second representative on.
Okay pamsos who is also a
drafter and so what we want of
to be fully transparent first uh
a little bit apprehensive about
that but I also recognize that
as a loan it creates buying it
creates an investment but you
act and what it's modeled on in
los crucials is that every small
business is one catastrophe way
several of your small business
owners so one catastrophe way
up and we know that in many
cases if it's under leader
funding that we know that it it
takes a little bit to get that
money the idea of this is that
that is that is clarified in
this bill but then the nmfa has
uh within five days to turn it
around so it is short turnaround
for money
nineteen starts the description
of at least eighty percent of
the total voting power of the
entity or at least eighty
percent of the total value of
the equity is owned by one or
more new mexico residents and
the headquarters and principle
refrigerator goes out or if a
stove top goes out
so it'd be non reverting funds
in the authority and if you'll
There are there are certainly
requisite credit worthiness so
to make sure that they can pay
back that loan so that coverage
has been in put in place
and that
clearly in here so it is a low
interest loan since we've had
that conversation it kind of
goes on the heels of our
conversation that we just had
uhm there is a report from so
thank you for martin for putting
that in there that um the
authority shells submit a report
to the legislature the
legislative finance committee
the
Good.
Oh she did a
so the ideas that they would
have to report to this they
would have to report to us the
the process in the progress of
that in you'll see on page ten
whether or not this is working
you know one of the things that
we want to make sure is that the
money that we are designating
can you also representative
mason so this is a a commitment
though of twenty five million
dollars martin was asking me you
know what I thought and
where we are now we we kind of
need to go back.
yesterday that DFA still has not
cut the junior money check so we
need to follow up with that
which will be something that we
will be doing on monday but the
request is for twenty five
also that there would be two
hundred and fifty thousand
dollars appropriate from the
general fund to the mfa
for administration and so given
sure that a business qualifies
for that is going to take time
we've heard examples today about
loan app loan approval so that
is that is where we are going
But I do feel that in a time is
of the essence because we are
seeing that in a number of areas
throughout the state where
businesses are shutting down so
I I feel that july twenty twenty
representatives of mark please
go first
thank you madame chairman
members of the committee.
This seems to take over the
insurance part of it are we
gonna be encouraging people.
Not to buy the insurance.
to run it tate ship because
we'll cover their back how do
you feel about that thank you
for the question representatives
of more at this only allows up
to twenty five thousand dollars
mortgage on a building that
there and they have to have
insurance on the and madam chair
and that's that's why i'm asking
is is there a necessity for this
kind of a of a bill in the state
everybody or we're gonna run out
of a pull of money and then
we're just gonna.
Help
the
first come first serve and then
an opportunity for us to have
those conversations after we get
reports from mfa on the
legitimacy of this so I I do
appreciate that it's got a a
short that's got a four year
chair I I think we're walking
water line on on
on the anti donation
he was are we hit in a grey area
here and then and then another
in business but just some of my
concerns.
And fifty fifty on it right now
maybe as we go through the
discussion and a rock one way or
share representatives the more
on members of the committee this
does seem to abide by the entire
donation clause because there is
consideration given there is an
Madam chair why the one percent
when when
were were proud like at eight
percent across the board or
thrive when we think about our
farmer here who may not have a
whole lot of capital on that
that at least this gives him an
opportunity if his tractor gets
broken to if his tractor breaks
things if I can add is during
the the pandemic you know there
were just these conversations
about whether or not we have a
loan or we give a grant and
there were some businesses that
That this was a complete shock
and they had no reserves
whatsoever to be able to do it
so I feel that the one percent
is an opportunity for those
businesses to see that this is a
loan that they can take.
defaults and the one percent
doesn't cover the defaults uh
then the taxpayers are going to.
We're going to carry the burden
on the loan manager well I do
believe that mfa if you look
of their ducks in a row in order
to even be considered for this
and so when I said that it puts
the responsibility on the
business to make sure that they
are available or eligible for
representative of montoya you
wanted to did you want to make a
comment yes thank you very much
yeah i've.
I'm probably fifty one percent
we shut down a lot of businesses
during covered and for
restaurants in particular we
shut him down and we opened them
up and then we shut him down and
And then once again last their
investment on the so as post
covered.
And post our our response in the
mexican small business.
was over a hundred I think might
have been been over a hundred
and ten restaurants state wide
during the government shut down
and.
Um.
I I would.
It even if I if this receives my
support during this legislative
session.
longer needed we just don't ever
seem to shut something down so
that would be something
consideration i'd like to
discussion like to have with you
at that time assuming we're both
dedicating money to that I I
want to make sure that we are
fiscally responsible in the
administration of this program I
do feel that it's something that
work in a short term right but
sometimes even things that work.
Lose their
their utility.
I'm going forward and might not
need it and once again we
so
but and I have a question
manager
i'm looking around the room and
i'm not a normal voting member
in this chamber but uh would I
am I going to be a voting
this also might address some of
your concerns is that.
You know their businesses that
don't know half of the programs
that were talked about today.
that even if a business doesn't
qualify for the last truce's
version of this the economic
development department can
connect those businesses with
other programs that are
programs because there are so
many so many folks who do not
know about what's available to
them and when I saw the
presentation from mfa I was like
wow I didn't I didn't know that
been dead dedicating money to
for years and we need to make
sure that those programs are
successful in that at ultimately
helps our small businesses.
Thank you representative montoya
representative on your normal.
a really quick questions pages
five and six the
rudent.
Lending what is it yet put a
lending practices a reference is
Item to online twenty
year madam share representative
first I have to provide a
disclaimer that I am merely here
for technical assistance on the
support or to be against the
policies of this bill so just to
clarify i'm only here for
technical assistance and as I
understand the prudent lending
practices I believe are defined
all investments that are made
with funds and the states money.
Ask them working thank you
manager martin.
That it.
I support the idea of this can
you tell me what what how much
did you put forward for the
junior phone funding for last
cuses businesses that covered
Okay good and I do yet have you
checked
providers are there an agreement
or support of this manager that
was passed in there not signed
by the governor I think is with
representative of dixons bill
with the entrepreneurship now
this this bill was something
that came in the last three days
the executive the director of
the last crucial city of last
crucial's economic development
department appreciate that thank
you very smart
so I do have a quick question on
more marquito online but maybe
we can answer this so we're
looking at
line seventeen when
I guess I think oh.
business relief loan and that is
receiving technical systems from
a service provider is eligible
to receive additional funding in
the amount of one half percent
of the loan amount to pay the
what is the total amount that
they would be eligible for if
they do I mean if they have
technical assistance why why did
you feel like you needed to put
this in the in the bill and i'm
sure.
builders are experiencing this
that the original specs on a
house have now increased a great
deal because of the cost of
goods and services so this is
also going to be monitored it's
dollars loan and the stove the
the
just for example to replace
their cooktop in a restaurant
and then they find out because
of the inspections that they
need to replace their heard and
that figure it manager it just
to say that the end is you go on
to read the bill in that section
during the term of the loan or
until the service providers are
business relief loan and shall
not require repayments so I
think um for me that might come
up as a questionable thing you
this manager I think that.
That's
the only thing I have but I do
support this idea I just want I
just don't want it to be
redundant and i'm seeing where
what we need to be doing to
prepare thank you yet no
representative and thank you so
much i'm I would actually like
to strike that line on page
because I I agree not requiring
page nine line twenty four
twenty five and then page ten
min one I would like to restrict
that because I think repayment
is required.
representative with him okay
representative little.
Thank you very much madam chair
let's see the the amount to
twenty five million
that as I read that was going to
four years thank you very much
but as representative montoya
you know when we get those
reports that's where there may
be an opportunity if we see that
there is this incredible need
and then our small businesses
only question okay great thank
you representative dunkin and
then represented a bregger.
Thank you manager
a couple of years ago I saw the
don't know the answer to that so
just a thought and then the
second thing paids lane area on
page of nine line fifteen the
shop or or maybe there's two of
you doing that
that person really
really
write so it could be an email
the technical assistance.
There's actually no cap to the
red the gross revenue of a
business to receive this loans.
wondering so there is there's no
cap but there is no floor
there's no minimum.
At air at the let me clarify
would not be excluded that
includes them thank you thank
you representative so
representative in your done okay
representative deborah.
that we did at the city during
cover and it was through the
american rescue fund and there
was a very low interest rate
we actually had a couple of
iterations of that so
I definitely support this and
then I just had the same
question as I think it was
represented montoya whether I
and one thing I want to thank
you representative one thing
that you know we we had wrestled
about because in los cruces we
have the city economic
development department that is
and so that's why having it at
the mf opens that up to all of
those real communities now there
is the challenge of making sure
that our small businesses have
that these rural communities and
the small businesses know about
this opportunity the city of
last cruises has done a great
job in using social media and
we put a time limit on it of
four years we have the
opportunity to reevaluate this
to see if this is worthwhile if
this is worth the money I do
to see them given that they are
so strap for cash now to see
just one thing shut them down.
And so I do appreciate the
support on this I do feel that
been completely unexpected which
is in the definition of
catastrophe of a catastrophe
catastrophic event you know this
does not cover a burner that has
gone out on a cooktop that
they've known about for years
that's where the insurance would
come in
manager just may make the motion
I would love up emotion.
but we're just making this still
asked to go through all the
committee process yeah
absolutely this is just for this
committee to say you know what
we like that in like whatever
yeah and then what I can do is
passing the hot system seen go
for it
but voucher I make the motion
that
the economic and rural
development and policy committee
endorse.
amended as amended yes thank you
very much representative
we have second we have
representative little
representative borrega going to
direct paper sizers to second
don't worry we'll get you during
session
none of I appreciate the
comments I appreciate that
because those are things that
are going to come up in the
discussion so I appreciate that
Thank you madame chair.
We've had the several
discussions of this particular
we've had discussions about the
need for economic development in
san on county
and
i'm not gonna go through this
and read line by line what I
is what what they are.
Someone county as we know
because of the eta we've lost
for a while and that is some
very strong agreement between
all of the governments located
shutdown of the power plant the
call mines
and if you look all the way up
to us to the escalate plant as
thousands of jobs in in that in
those communities and as we had
discussed discussion during a
debate over the eta
one of the things that we tried
the coming is the equivalent to
real rancho may be losing intel.
Or if we're gonna look at the
city of albuquerque it's if
homelessness is up dramatically
poverty has gone up dramatically
and never honation in particular
a job at one of the one of the
has as the numbers have shown
helped that one family and three
additional
households so maybe a great make
maybe a apparent sorry brother
number I want to give here is
on the nab honation in
particular three out of every
four children now are living in
households within comes under a
allison
but because of this uh in
particular
the new president of the
nabonation bunigran I his.
Madam chair is much as possible
to.
Two end as much poverty is
from in particular uh the
economic development director
from an abhonation arbitrary
heal
is two
cents or losing economic based
notification that a couple of
the answers that we were looking
at for sale when county and for
up in mckinley and county and
even over into sibola
And so we just I just got that
information so we were going
down the road of four hundred
and hundred pro projects in the
state of new mexico which I
don't think we really have their
funds to do that though those
projects at least for now seem
to be dead in the water so those
were some economic based jobs
that we were looking at.
county to work in cooperation to
try and build a rail economy and
we do have enough we've we've
done a previously with a former
a rail service from sound one
county located on the nabonation
back to the eye forty quarter
that feasibility study has been
done now there has we've moved
by the governor is committed
dollars to that and then have a
whole nation has committed but
uhm i'd like to pass this over
to representative else and so he
could
representative and madame tear
never who nation really supports
this initiative and the support
is so much that the
just a short section of the
preamble in three whereas is it
states the memorandum of
understanding is intered into
and between the never who nation
state of new mexico here in
referred to a send one county
here in referred to individually
as a party and collectively as
the parties
development of never hold
businesses and it's
infrastructure in all sectors of
the never who nation to create a
sustainable economy to improve
strong brazilian self sufficient
community with diverse economy a
highly trained work force and
thriving local businesses and
cooperation with respect to a
real way development and related
community and business
development of mutual interests
and benefits those are the three
largest metropolis ten
statistical area in the nation
with no freight real
secondly there is no interstate
in the region shown and this
limited in this region so that
is one of the reasons why we're
looking forward to this economic
initiative thank you madame
chair.
Thank you representative
so far.
You're grabbing the mike so does
that mean you're gonna ok.
Representative dunkin
you know one thing that there
are
and there was AAA person
representing the navigation and
my his name escapes me at the
moment but seen that circle and
seen that there are no real
for the naba who nation to be
able to a thrive economically
and so i'm really grateful that
you've brought this forward
representatives and will let you
thank you for the presentation
representatives.
If I snap my fingers today and
you had a railroad there.
What would you load on that
train
is nab who agricultural products
right now we are
not able
to compete with for at one point
located in in someone county it
became it's they relocated to
where there was a rail
had brought a developer who was
looking in the sound one county
in in to help us diversify and
because we do have natural gas
and we do have
natural gas but not all of these
plastics.
Petroleum and in natural gas is
a feedstock to make
everything that we have that is
plastic.
this would just be the feed
stock combined with our
technology now that we've
had a lot of conversation on and
on on carbon sequestration we
today we also have some small
manufacturers that are in salad
county but that's just talking
about the outflow.
The inflow would be all of the
moving freight by real can lower
green has house gas emissions
up to seventy five percent
we were given that presentation
Is going to it is going to cause
our omissions to go down and
it'll also mean our road
maintenance will go down
dramatically because what really
damages those road is the heavy
what comes in it's not just what
would go out of sound one county
and it's not just someone county
if we had that rail spur there
now we're getting business to
benefit from this and that real
that means and and for and this
is how the naponation when I was
speaking with a president of
nightmare what really is
something that has been in the
Because all of the products that
are purchased with exception of
ship rock which is on navonation
all everything else is a border
town galpa's border town
All those border towns at least
in in southern colorado and in
new mexico in the four corners
area formington boomfield
would then
industry and it allows us to
diversify which is the that was
the purpose when we are hearing
about the eta was to encourage
our communities to diversify
thank you is represent i'd like
to what representative montoya
said at when I was working at
the never who mine we ran a
from the amtrak and we converted
them we reduced them to low
speed so they could accommodate
the mining industry so the work
force is ready and available to
not going to stand back to watch
it go to other people they're
going to jump in there and fix
the reals themselves so that is
a big job opportunity whether we
would even volunteer to help
train some of the upcoming
electricians to
you know stripped and make him
thank you so much representative
dunkin and then representative
little.
Thank you manager as the as the
mayor in this old community I
to other states for jobs and and
this will create jobs in our
community where families can
stay in new mexico can stay in
san one county and and do what
needs to be done
Will will transport how many
tons of merchandise.
The.
He had asked me a test question
page two.
Umm i'm paid to
scheduled to close in twenty
thirty one and will result in
the last thousands of additional
additional jobs and millions of
dollars in revenue
plant shut down this is now the
whole call mine and for corners
power plant the last remaining
power plant and by the way thank
you for that question that one
So if that goes away and we
don't bring new jobs in it would
be at that point as if the oil
and gas industry stopped
been taken out of the way this
is really kind of our last hope.
Thank you for that clarification
that's really key because in my
mind I
make a recommendation please and
it's a only two of somewhat
minor on page three line sixteen
spell that out with nable
agricultural products or the
proper upper title
and put this in parentheses
are going to make going on going
forward we will make that change
a committee that
representative little we're also
going to add us a specific uh
nabonations I mention that
earlier but it's not in here as
a warehouse that's represented
my toyota actually we so what we
need to do is make those changes
that language that would be
great thank you and madam chair
so if we can do that in the ad
nappy
to all that out to be naval
Because taking it right to the
heavy be specific in the line so
he can where you sign up.
We're on page three nine sixteen
is that where you're talking
about the correction connect to
Or just say on just a located.
Near the e
nabo agricultural products
incorporated complex.
That would probably be a better
And madam sure the other I think
will leave the other off will
just that will be a discussion
point as we present and that'll
be good enough okay martin did
you have question yeah madame
cause their guest like we just
need to agree on the specific
language right now for.
The amendment seems like areas
would would cover be located
near wouldn't you think I think
of areas in line sixteen does
that.
Already covered be located near
yes I think it would we could
remove this die areas
areas is be located near
actually necessary because areas
covers that general.
near.
Near the best day so
make them proper we don't want
to do as leave the same big us
to course not located on the nab
yeah so madam share and
representative in the.
The resulting clause we have the
language purchase for
That's on page for that sir yeah
page four lines the one through
six and that's the specific ask
of the memorial for.
On page three lines thirteen
so we can spell it out but
that's not like that's a binding
anything thank you madame
charlie you know what I don't
want to change anything that has
been agreed to I would rather
of let's do that that'll be the
easiest thing I don't want to
change anything that that I
don't have the authority to
change.
Yep madam share representative
one thought too just to clarify
read whereas of memorandum of
agreement are the excess between
the naval nation and sam on
county to pursue the development
and study the feasibility and
environmental impact of a
freight rear line.
So he guess pay the big bucks
so that works with that that
amendment
just and I think martin just
proven that he is supporting of
elements to include a
specifically to be on the nab
nation and to spell out what
nappy means those are the two
representatives of more you
motion representative did you
want to make any other comments
before we do that yes thank you
man i'm cherry I do support this
I was having difficulty and I
and I have been to bar return
i've spent a little time there
i'm trying to make the
present south real way company
real line on I forty quarter
between gallop and grants so the
so the connection goes from
through the naval honation
connects down to gal or I guess
some point and time.
Yes madame chair the I th- there
is a rail that goes along by
forty and that is where we would
connect from there.
you would have to build in order
to connect make those
connections anymore like what my
how many miles are so madam
too through
and that's one of the options is
to go to that route
that has its own problems some
of that is checkerboard area
zero a lot of folks want it to
go that way
the other would connect
potentially
to
the uhm up until just recently
all of the right of ways existed
and it was already levelled
but that would cause it to be a
further.
reasonable and and easiest route
in and if it's a it's a if it's
a hundred car plus train there
has to be certain grades so uhm.
and and representatives and
senators
in terms of
and I used to serve on the
middle real ground council of
government's transportation
both alternatives in there
rather than being definitive
because if this passes and you
know you don't want to have to
come back later on in amend it
us and then also
madame chair and I don't know if
I have not worked in that
regions but I I do know like
compete for federal money city
moneys state money
if you can identify if there is
a a regional transportation
that the state highway
department is involved in them
you know so I would definitely
maybe make reference to that if
matter of fact DO t is in this
process already and the
governor's office and it does
say that it will connect in the
quarter somewhere between.
forget the horizons the ask is
to ask the federal delegation to
support this effort from the
federal government
national implications so this is
something that we're asking
for them to come in with a major
portion of this which it's been
indicated that there's interest
in that but we're going to ask
just ourselves suggest that this
similar memorial go through your
city council and be approved by
at the federal level and so I
think this is really appropriate
yes and and manage her that all
of that has happened part of the
the the big group that's
although someone county has been
the signer
Thank you representative thank
you represented montoya think
you represented a ballison
representatives a mora has
sir as amended manager thank you
do I have a second to it did I
hear the second from
representative of mason all
right all in favor of the
economic and real development
policy committee endorsing this
In animals in the endorsement as
amended thank you very much
and represented my toyota so
there are three bits of
from somebody in the room and so
representative montoya has
agreed to along the same lines
of railroad is agreed to co
senator diamond brantley's bits
of legislation as his vice chair
gagas but will that represent a
montoya go ahead and go first
thank you madam sure this is
something that would also be
to encourage as we've discussed
earlier as to how much more fuel
efficient it is to transport
real that exists personal are
corporate income tax credits up
to fifty percent of the eligible
railroads qualified expenditures
the the railroads community tax
curve credit for serving rail
customers so the total dollar
amount from the state would be
capped at five million dollars
but it it is up to five million.
And that would be on the
expenditure that would be
nice companion but I don't
believe we'd get anywhere near a
million dollars from uh the tax
credit if we're asking for a
substantial amount of investment
from the federal government this
on the project but this wouldn't
just be for us and matter fact
representative diamond has
brought this forward at least
once before and this would help
other infrastructure and is also
much more friendly to the
environment.
With that madam chair myself and
martin will stand for questions.
Okay representative dunkin has
emotion
to support in this committee the
economic development rolled
to maintain so with that we have
a motion from representative
dunkin do I have a second from
representative to berego all in
favor say I
any opposed.
So this this piece of
legislation states that there
will be a million dollar
appropriation
twenty twenty five through
twenty twenty eight for the new
mexico department of agriculture
to fund and provide root stock
of vines for the production of
would ask for your approval of
this legislation endorsement and
if I can add to this this
I don't think the illegal I
don't I love wine will be added
our state and also being an area
that has
some of the earliest vines in
the country we beat out napa
this is an opportunity to
garages or to existing growers
I I would have an easier time to
support it if it's to new
growers that that don't have any
Okay matter in vice chair so so
this will go to new guards and
and then is what's a limit for
particular individual to to take
on this.
share representative to clarify
the answer to your first
question I believe that the
production of new vineyards
could go to existing or to new
producers and then if you
The.
Madam share representative it is
not clarified in this
appropriation that believe that
bill I think it needs to more as
it goes along through the
process
i'd hate for it to just to go on
drawer
and i'd really rather it go to a
thank you madame chair as a
being newly on this bill I will
make sure that we we start
having those discussions and put
those
qualifiers in there thank you
Alright at this point then do I
have any other questions or do I
have a motion.
I make a motion to move manager.
We have a motion for a
representative of zamora to uh
for this committee the economic
and rural development policy
committee to endorse this draft
legislation of making an
appropriate appropriation to the
mexico department of agriculture
and the board regions from
mexico state university to fund
The.
All right one more bit of
legislation this is one of the
things that i'm really grateful
that senator diamond brantley
we continue to move forward with
this one of the things it's
always heartbreaking for all of
us is when our young people have
to leave because there are no
jobs for them here.
a high school hospitality career
program that supports the
development of a talent pipeline
for the state's hospitality
industry I see this along the
lines of CTE and the investment
Okay so that that is correct.
Do you have any questions on
this I am fairly new to the
spell as well as so as
representative montoya to send
here to answer this question but
why is the grant to the tourism
department instead of to the
department of education.
Are they gonna understand if
it's going to be taught in the
as far as I understand uh I
believe senator i'm brightly
believe that tourism was best
situated with the expertise and
with this program to be able to
don't this is not something we
specifically have any expertise
in in a state new mexico but it
is curious to me I don't still
don't think that's the right
landing spot for the money
Okay so we do have to be
specific on where that lands.
Thank you for bringing that up.
Moves to endorse this
legislation uh that is to make
an appropriation to the tourism
department for a high school
that supports the development of
a talent pipeline for the
state's hospitality industry
that motion has been put forth
by representative dunkin do I
have a second
endorsed by this committee so
what will happen is on those
bills it will say endorsed by
the economic and rural
development policy committee
okay and so thank you all for
as we finish up a big thank you
to the great folks at the
university of new mexico taus
uh branch for taking care of us

allowing us to use the city hall

being open for discussions and
for making this a safe place for
all of us I think we all

don't have the radio voice i'll
have to work on that um

committee the interim I think

committee because it's a great
exchange of ideas there's a
respect across the aisle because
the city mexico so thank you for
that and I look forward to a lot

hard work because I think small

really looked for a look to you
