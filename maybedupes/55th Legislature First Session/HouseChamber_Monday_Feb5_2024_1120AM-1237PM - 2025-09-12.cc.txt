every year how much I look
forward to seeing the staff.
They're just we have the most
amazing staff.
We have the most amazing people
that work here. We have the most
amazing sergeant at arms and we
had the most amazing security
team I've ever met in my life,
and some of them actually live
in my district. I've gotten to
know their families and their
the most wonderful people, But
the thing I love about them is
they're still not afraid to say
Represent Lord Stop
We have the most amazing people

amazing sergeant at arms and we
had the most amazing security
team I've ever met in my life.
And some of them actually live
in my district. I've gotten to
know their families and their
the most wonderful people. But
the thing I love about them is
they're still not afraid to say
Represent Lord Stop!
We have the most amazing people
that work here. We have the most
amazing sergeant at arms and we
had the most amazing security
team I've ever met in my life,
and some of them actually live
in my district. I've gotten to
know their families and their
the most wonderful people. But
the thing I love about them is
they're still not afraid to say
Represent Lord Stop
representatives Sit down.
Represent Laura, Stop speaking.
So I love the fact that they are
completely nonpartisan. And
we'll tell me when I'm talking
too much when I'm a committee
and I'm actually there to speak,
and I'm sitting there and I'm my
mouth is running so
I just want to say we should say
big, huge round of applause for
our staff that stays here at
night, our security team and the
sergeant arms and we should all
tell them how grateful they are
that they have to stay here late
night. So thank you, Mr Speaker.
Big round of applause for staff.
Is that a promise not to keep
him here any later anymore,
Original lady.
Maybe Mr Speaker. It's been, uh,
webcast and archived for
everyone to see.
Gentlemen from
Lose. See what I McKinley
representative. Welcome. Thank
you. Mr Speaker. I just would
like to rise on a point of
personal privilege. Purpose of
your point, Mr Speaker. I just,
uh
A little bit bothered by the
fact that everything is just
been changing lately. To where
Just things are not working
cohesively like they always
have.
Speaker, you know Friday
We had a, uh we met in
judiciary.
And it was the same night that
the 100 Bill party was going on.
Members of hard party went to
judiciary. We heard the builds
over there.
Memories that minority went to
the did their constitutional
duty and they went to the 100
Bill Party or another. I feel
kind of jaded because I think I
should have gone to the 100 Bill
party instead of going to
judiciary.
But this is Speaker.
Here's what bothers me the most.
You know, when you look at the
golden rotten
It is understood.
And it does say two o'clock in
the evening at three o'clock in
the evening.
But it basically means
That's not the time that you're
going to go to committee.
And basically what it means that
you're going to go to the
community after we get off the
floor. That's basically what
happens all the time.
Sunday morning at three o'clock
in the morning.
That was the end of the day's
session.
That was Sunday. That's that was
Saturday, the Golden Rod had a
calendar.
And we met and I said, we are
going after the committee after
we get off the floor because
that would have happened if it
would have been a normal day, we
would have gotten out that 10 or
11 or seven or eight in the
evening. But of course, since
everything went down, and we had
a fantastic debate until three
in the morning
The end of the day was 3 A.m..
So I called the meeting my
community, which
What's on the calendar.
And the leadership of the other
party told their members ordered
the members not to go.
And I, and it makes me feel bad
because
These people. I had witnesses. I
had staff everything, ladies
that we could have this meeting
Whenever the end of the session
came into that day came
Over there, Mr Speaker. The
witnesses were there. The staff
are there.
But none of the membership from
the other party were there, but
we met as a group. We had enough
people to have a quorum. We did
the duty that we were supposed
to do. We did our constitutional
duty. We did what we was.
And in all fairness, I think
that we should stop this little
game of playing party politics
and start working for the people
of the state of New Mexico. I
mean, I don't blame you for to
go. I don't blame the other guys
for going to the 100 Bill party.
I'm still jealous that I didn't
do it. But anyway, Mr Speaker,
Thank you.
An announcement The gentleman
from Cibola McKinley originally
Oh, San Juan Valencia
represented Garcia, hopefully
with an announcement with red
Chili chips. Thank you, Mr
Speaker. I just want an apology
to the staff.
And new sergeant apartment
stuff. You guys are all invited
to that chicken dinner.
On Wednesday at noon.
I apologize for that that rubber
chicken we will all be there, Mr
Speaker, someone's from churches
from from Kentucky Fried Chicken
and some from Albertsons.
Finally, we got to the bottom of
the chicken dilemma.
Gentlemen from San Juan
Representative Lane. Thank you,
Mr Speaker. I I love hearing
remarks that opened up with
This house is more divided than
it has been in the past and then
continue to throw gasoline on
the fire.
That is not lost on me. I want
to compliment the generated from
Dona Ana, who's a chair.
Who who made a ruling that was
within the rules, But you
recognized it wasn't proper and
she had the humility to stand up
on this floor.
And recognize that her actions
were not helpful.
And that's the model. I think
that we should have for our
chairs, and I think many of our
chairs show that example and I
want to compliment her.
For doing that, because I think
that's the right thing to do.
And I would encourage other
chairs that have done something
similar to make the same
comments. Thank you, Mr Speaker.

gentleman has withdrawn the
prior amendment.
I see no objection. It is
ordered.
Gentlemen, Would you like to
move? House Floor Amendment
number one to Hillsborough, 88
as amended, Mr Speaker, right?
It's getting passed out. We'll
give it another few seconds and
All right. Looks like the
amendments been passed out.
Gentlemen from Lincoln and
Otero, can you please read the 2
to 8 number?
Mr Speaker. The 2 to 8 number is
2 to 8042.2. I have and that's
what's been passed out the
gentleman to explain the
amendment. Thank you, Mr
Speaker. And first I would like
to start off thanking you for
your patience.
I would also like to
Thank leader Lane and Minority
Whip Sapan ski for their
leadership as well.
And then I'd also like to thank
representative Break Go, and,
uh, representative Luhan for
their goodwill and they're not
easy. Horse trainers. Mr
Speaker. It took us a little
while. But what I did appreciate
is
What I like to call back in the
olden days when we used to sit
around the table and hash things
out.
And this really got hashed out
so
Thank you for that. Mr Speaker
and this bill does three things.
It ensures number one is it
ensures emergency medical
technicians are noted everywhere
in the bill that firefighters
are noted
There were a number of places in
the bill that only reference
firefighters, including omitting
the requirement and D F a
established program that
addressed the MTs.
But then allowed local districts
to use their dollars for fighter
fighters in the MTs.
The second thing it does. Mr
Speaker is it removes license,
sirs and certification language
in the last sentence of the of
Section one.
Which will allow the greatest
flexibility for use of these
funds and then number three is
it creates a fun that aligns
with language included in House
Bill two.
Which allocates $5 million to
the firefighter recruitment
fund.
And also Mr Speaker. I forgot
the expert witnesses.
I do appreciate everything that
they did to help us make this
amendment possible. Thank you.
Gentlemen. Gentlelady from
Berlin. Leo. Representative
Borrego. Is this a friendly
amendment?

to House Bill 88, as amended has

And with that, I know that we
win an hour and 58 minutes on
that, And I mean, that was
plenty. I had a lot of more a
lot more questions. But, Mr

hashed this idea out enough, and
this is good legislation. And
with that
I'm done.
