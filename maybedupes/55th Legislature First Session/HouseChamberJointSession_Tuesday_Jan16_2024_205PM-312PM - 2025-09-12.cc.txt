I run on caffeine.
Yeah.
Confirm reading.
Hmm.
Most of all and when I think my
phone new mexicans who were
building the tomorrow that we
will share together i'm grateful
for your participation for your
willingness to think big and act
boldly to address the challenges
that we face.
When I became governor in twenty
nineteen I promised delay.
Incredibly strong foundation for
economic prosperity.
And in the years since then it
has become second nature to
associate in mexico with the
jobs of today and tomorrow if
you want a great career than
mexico is the place to be if you
want a if you're looking for a
place to start a new business
and have new opportunities in
the mexico is the place to be if
you want an innovative
successful business remexico is
in fact the place to be able.
And I proud to say.
Dnmt.
So do it arms.
I hope they're going to be
happier later and we talk about
all the climate change and
renewable energy that we're
going to lean into.
I.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And why we are dealing with that
I think it is really important
it takes courage for a young
person whether it's in the right
place or not we're releaning in
or not this is a stay and this
is the country that protects
people who don't share your
exact opinion and i'm very far
back.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
That takes courage and it takes
patience and understanding from
all of us and we're gonna
continue to be that state.
All right i'm brought to say
that new mexico has the highest
number of jobs in its history.
That is.
The.
We are one of the best states
for job growth in the country.
And we're the best state for
wage growth in the entire
nature.
The.
The.
The.
Without it a hundred and ten
thousand jobs in the past three
and a half years giving more
people than ever the chance to
earn a living.
Get ahead and provide for their
families for years to come.
And at the same time we are
insuring there are young people
inherent estate with the
splendor and abundant resources
that we have been privileged to
enjoy our land of enchantment
legacy fund.
Is enriching conservation
programs in counties and tribal
communities state wine
preserving the states natural
beauty.
Our tax credits and clean car
rules are strengthening that
position.
We are in fact a clean energy
state.
And it's important to note that
we have cut pollution from the
oil and gas industry in half.
Compared to our neighbors in
texas and are nothing rules were
recently adopted by the federal
government as the standard for
smart regulation we're
demonstrating that a healthy
environment and a strong economy
are not in conflict offering a
new model than a mexico model
for a states like hours all
across the country.
And with record state revenues
we are growing or financial
strengths at a rate never before
seeing in our entire history the
start of my administration that
states bond reading was at risk
in our reserves were just a
third of what they are today.
We rake among the top states for
a financial growth and stability
and have grown our permanent
find more than two hundred
percent offering the promise
we're gonna clap of a
sustainable future for
generations to come.
The.
The.
The.
The.
Unless be clear this is no
accident it is our collective
effort.
It is the result of a forward
looking comprehensive strategy
to generate ongoing economic
progress with new ideas that
only a state like ours can
pioneer.
A nimble state a determined
state a forged by are rugged
landscapes and fueled by our
diverse communities bill for
innovation and made to leave so
the question now is.
What's next that's the question
that the five the character of
new mexico strong minded
pioneering and creative after
all.
This is the state that split the
arm.
And one account of close mac
war.
And it is working to make hole
the people in families affected
by its impacts the state that
sold the first personal computer
and created the modern clean
room.
The state that invalid the
breakfast burrito the green
chile cheeseburger the flaming
hot chito and the freedom pie.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I saw some when bringing freedom
pies and I noticed I did not
get.
In every generation we have
looked beyond the challenges of
the moment to launch ideas and
industries that pay dividends
decade after decade.
In the last five months along
five months we've brought in
companies from australia germany
singapore and taiwan promising
twenty four hundred additional
jobs and a ten year aconomic
impact of seven billion dollars
solidifying that.
The maxi codes place as an
economic power house and just
want to remind us that small
state states with.
Rural tiny populations.
It is not synonymous to say
you're in economic power house
in last your in new mexico it is
amazing.
And frankly is on giving this
speech right now we're
announcing that.
Thank you
carbon will soon be calling
bloomfield.
New mexico home this leading you
guys can somebody conclude
without useless.
I love it I like businesses in
every.
This leading manufacturer of air
and water purification tools
will support customers across
the western annual western
united states and it's going to
bring jobs to these world
communities that too often
frankly get overlooked.
Masa film and studios.
Is building a full service state
of the art production facility
in albuquerque at a time when
production studios nationwide
are booked years out.
It's yet another reason for the
most ambitious
only give them their deal.
Started at arms.
The.
The.
The.
The.
The.
The.
The.
The.
This.
The.
Well job security for the entire
session for sergeant of arms.
The.
We also seem to have several
protests going on at once and if
anyone needs me to talk about
what they are.
The.
This.
The.
The.
Yeah.
Alright we have a couple more on
this right just want to make
sure.
This.
And again.
Where where we're going to do
what I expect everyone to do.
I want you to do a round of
applies even though it's a
disruption that the world is
complicated.
The.
I.
And that far too many young
people find themselves locked
into a situation where it's very
hard to have clarity about the
right steps forward.
And rather we wouldn't we all
want a situation where we
embrace differences of opinion.
Some discord may be a disruption
or an interruption.
While we recognize that when I
can have all the answers to the
world's problems certainly not
in today's speech maybe not even
tomorrow's actions but we will
in fact.
Yeah.
Ever dedicated and committed.
The solving and tackling as many
of our own issues as we leave
the entire nation and quite
frankly the world on the best
practices that made sure that we
continue to be a state that
leaves.
I.
The.
And I was bragging about
businesses so make no mistake
i'm going to keep doing that
because this film studio is the
reason that additional ambitious
productions are going to choose
in a mexico again making sure
that young people all people are
in a position to follow their
dreams and bring careers.
Last august we celebrated the
state's largest manufacturing
deal ever.
When maxion solar technologies
chose in the mexico to resure
the first solar cell plant the
first one.
In the united states.
Yeah.
A billion dollar enterprise that
comes with nearly two thousand
jobs.
The message is clear and we're
hearing it again and again from
companies worldwide new mexico
is where businesses want to be
so I have a suggestion let's
capitalise on this more madam
around the globe.
Access to water is now the
greatest challenge of the
century.
New mexico
can turn that in to an
opportunity.
Now a match in the potential of
turning the ocean of brackets
water beneath our feet.
In the water we can put to use
to meet the demands of
communities now and in the
future to sustain our economic
growth and the meet this moment
with the first of its kind
solution.
The strategic water supply.
It will build a secure resilient
water future for our state.
Now i'm asking the legislature.
For five hundred million in
severance tax bonds to make this
strategic water supply a reality
spurring the private sector to
turn an untapped resource in the
water that we can use without
asking taxpayers to front all of
those costs.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The.
The.
I'm also proposing that we
dedicate two percent of our
severance tax permanent fund
that's about a hundred and
seventy million dollars.
To count a pole forward the
advanced energy sources of the
future.
Hydrogen geothermal next
generation battery storage
further committing our state to
the climate goals of the
country.
And beyond.
The.
Yeah.
And that's not all i'm
announcing a commitment to
pursue and advanced
manufacturing tax credit a
companion to the ground breaking
inflation reduction act.
The.
The.
So good arms.
This.
The.
The.
Yeah.
The.
The.
The.
I still think we can be
to the.
As.
We're clearing again.
Let's be gentle.
The.
The.
The.
Gives me an opportunity to just
talk about whatever I want.
The.
The.
The.
This might be a an excellent
place.
For parents.
There are other things in the
gallery who stand for things
that not everybody in this room
is going to agree on.
And we're going to talk about it
later in the speech like gun
violence.
But they provide space for
everyone.
And for the young people who
were showing us their courage.
This is also a state that can
lean in about.
A bit better to making sure that
we are kind.
And polite and that we're
listening particularly too.
We are in fact a national
climate leader so anyone in this
room.
And anyone with children of
their own or young people as
advocates make sure that all of
the facts are being presented in
a way that create the kind of
heart felt commitment to change
but recognizes the progress in
the state and in this room alone
certainly not lost on me and I
know not on start whilst I knew
we have not always agreed on
every solution or every energy
source and yet today the mexico
is still it clean energy leader
and as long as i'm governor
we're in a cue following that
cat.
Alright so.
Now i'm a little lost you can
stall for a minute and i'll
catch up.
But this manufacturing tax
credit don't go back.
Stay always leaning and go
forward so last night when I was
practicing the export guy say
are you going to go offscript
I mean that's not going to
happen what is this like my six
time of course i'm gonna go
offscript.
Because I hope that i'm getting
the right messages in but i'm
reading the room and if you
can't do that and I want to tell
you if it's not as easy as I
hope i'm making it look right
now because it's hard and it's
really hard for someone who's
trying to find this while i'm
doing it imagine what it's like
helping me deliver a speech in
another country where they don't
speak english and i'm a real
challenge so let's give the
folks running my teleprompter
around in the clothes.
Because.
It's not easy.
So i'm about ready to hit that
first we're delivering hang on
one more second.
We want the we want the tools
that are working in the federal
government and I know that is
your traveling I know that is
you're getting a businesses who
were talking to you about
relocating here.
That the tax credits.
That the investments that the
share responsibility in economic
success.
Is making a difference and make
no mistake that these companies
particularly in the advanced
energy sector.
And the resuring of
manufacturing solar has
everything to deal with the
federal investments knowing
unequivocally that that works
the state that's got some of its
own resources.
You want to make sure that
you're continuing to read that
nobody can compete.
Then we lean into the same
strategies that advanced energy
tax credit for advance
manufacturing.
I feel incredibly bolish.
Would continue to make new
mexico or place where every
business.
Address and climate change and
new innovations is gonna want to
be so let's see if we can't get
that over the finish.
Regards.
After all delivering on the
promise of a clean energy future
requires modern efficient
infrastructure from a resilient
power grid to safe roads to
reliable drinking water.
Between federal and state
funding and thank you by the way
we're putting more than seven
billion dollars an
infrastructure funds to work
right now in every county in the
state.
Just recently we broke ground on
the sun transmission line.
The largest authority renewable
energy project.
Ian united states history all
right the biggest.
That delivers green electrons
electrons what my garden across
the south west so isn't colorado
going to be mad with an economic
impact of twenty point five
billion dollars.
We sped up and delivered on the
naval gallop water supply
project a billion dollar
initiative more than a decade in
the making and a result of our
collective work this project is
already bringing drinking water
to six thousand new mexicans.
The.
The majority.
Of whom live on the naval
nation.
And have it had reliable
drinking water.
In the next fifteen years this
project will serve a quarter of
the million more in a mexicans.
The.
The.
They are.
We rebuilt.
The new mexico state veterans
home in truth or consequences.
With new.
Scate of the arts.
Independent living communities
and homes for veterans and their
families who have answered the
call of duty.
And I submit that if you were
building your dream home.
This is what it would look like
and it is exactly what our
veterans in new mexico deserve.
I.
Yeah.
The.
The.
And again there's nothing else
like it in the public sector
anywhere.
In the country.
Nothing like it.
Projects like these have impacts
that go far beyond their walls
they create thousands of jobs
both now and into the future
they bring new activity and new
opportunities to community state
why they make our neighborhood
stronger safer and more
resilient.
And still there's more we can do
that's why I am asking the
legislature for a hundred
million dollars to support an
infrastructure matching fund so
communities don't leave any
federal money on the table for
lack of a local.
The.
And it's why i'm asking for
fifty five million dollars to
continue expanding a wide spread
charging infrastructure network
for electric vehicles charging
an electric car or truck should
be as easy and convenient as
pumping gas and whether you're
going from damning the clighten
from farming to intercarl's bad
from whilst cruises the las
vegas where you're taking the
high road from santa fe details
residents and tourists alike
should be able to get from one
end of the state to the other no
matter what vehicle they drive.
The.
The.
The.
And I think we need to take the
same forward looking approach to
housing.
At a moment when the mexicans
are working hard to rent or
purchase homes.
That are too often out of reach.
A house is so much more than a
roof over your head.
More affordable homes mean more
families on their feet more
workers able to work more
stability more hope and more
opportunity.
And we know what that new mexico
quick frankly today needs to
construct thousands of homes his
fast as possible.
Yet to often housing development
is stalled by a complicated web
of zoning and permitting
requirements that very from city
to city and county to county to
build for the future we need to
find development smart.
Fair equitable development and
then we need to get quite
frankly the hell out of our own
way.
And i'm asking the legislature
for two things first i'm asking
for funding to build the housing
we need two hundred and fifty
million dollars in low interest
loans to spur the private sector
to build faster.
And two hundred and fifty
million dollars to massively
expand home buying programs like
down payment assistance.
The.
Yeah.
I.
So we're prepared and more new
mexicans like my brother's
granddaughter in myer.
Can get into safe affordable
housing when they're ready to do
so.
And at the same time I intend to
create an office of housing as a
one stop shop for developers and
contractors looking to build and
for families who were seeking
home of their own.
Second as the condition of
receiving stake funding for
housing development.
I am also asking the
legislature.
To require local governments to
institute zoning and permitting
requirements but me national
best practices.
Nobody should be prevalent from
building vital housing and no
body should be shut out of a
place to live because of
outdated and overlapping
bureaucratic regulations.
The.
The health of our communities
and of our families remains one
of my highest priorities.
We were just the third state to
cap the cost of insulin setting
the lowest price of the time in
the country.
The frankly serving is the model
for other states to meet that
price point because the mexicans
shouldn't have to decide between
their medications and a meal.
We've increased medicaid
provider reads I thank you for
that all expanded the health
care professional loan repayment
program and they thank you for
that.
Cause it keeps more doctors and
nurses and health care workers
in our state and with the eighty
million from the royal health
care delivery fund there was a
word of last year to communities
we have made it easier for new
mexicans to get the health care
that they need from ambulance
services in modern.
To alter sounds in mckinley
county from obtamatory in curry
county to dental services and
sierra county.
From primary care for seniors
and balance the accounting to
behave or a house in lee county.
These initiatives are working.
That's why I am requesting
another hundred million for the
rural health care delivery fund.
Additional medicare funding so
our providers can meet growing
demands.
And the hospital provider tax.
Which will bring in an
additional one point five to two
billion dollars into our state
shoring up our health care
delivery system without costing
patience.
Or providers a die.
And let's complete the health
care authority this session.
Doing so will reduce premiums
cut out of pocket costs increase
consumer protections demand
better provider networks and
hold the insurance companies
accountable.
New mexicans should never have
their lives or livelihoods
threatened by insurance
companies that are more
determined to make a dollar than
a difference.
The.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And as we look towards the
future we are also looking
towards our young people and
working to provide nation
leading education at every age.
Today we are the only state in
the US and congratulations with
a constitutional right to child
care and the only state in the
country to require both free and
nutrition school meals.
The.
The.
The.
Are structured literacy
curriculum is delivering real
results over the last year alone
we saw four percent statewide
increase in reading scores for
kids in grade three to eight.
And an unprecedented five
percent increase in reading
scores for native american
students something that the
state has in fact not
accomplished ever before.
It is.
The.
The.
The.
Four percent state why.
Five percent among native
american students but here's the
thing.
The pocket school district were
they implemented and in braced
the structured literacy program
in its entirely.
Hawaki saw double digit gains in
their reading scores all right
only six percent.
The.
The.
See a problem over there.
Now what that that's what
schools.
Can do when they partner with
the state and take full
advantage of the historic tools
strategies and resources that
you.
And thank you have put quite
frankly at their finger t.
Today.
And her daughter is a student at
borendo elementary in roswell.
And stephanie put it to us this
way.
I've seen my daughter make huge
educational strides this year.
With their help a structured
literacy curriculum.
She's sounding out words much
easier and faster than her older
brother wants it.
Clearly the science of reading
is a much more effective way to
teach reading.
She also remarked that
structured literacy is now make
a good difference for her son as
well.
I will give if you're a parent.
You know that that kind of
progress.
Is a regame chang.
And I know only quite that we
can ensure double down on our
successes and supercharge our
results.
The united states has some of
the lowest literacy rates of any
wealthy nation and countries
with the highest levels use
structured literacy programs.
We have it works there and we've
seen it work right here in the
mexico now i'm calling for
thirty million dollars in
capital to build a state wide
literacy institute and another
thirty million dollars to
support free literacy summer
programs for ten thousand
students who need to catch up to
grade level every student and
frankly every new mexican should
be given the opportunity to
learn to read the best of their
ability no student.
Should ever be told that their
progress is not a priority
parents and kids deserve.
The.
Yeah.
The.
The very best from all of us in
this room.
And they deserve the best and
they have the ability in our
school system look out like you
I am proud of all of our public
education efforts but we got to
be doing this work together.
And it's why i'm calling for an
expansion of the school year to
one hundred and eighty days and
i'm asking the legislature to
fund it so that every child and
public schools get the time they
need and the education but they
deserve.
And we've seen here.
And is dates across the country.
It's evidence based it's not
we're just.
Making up a strategy.
That more quality in structure
makes a difference and we've
seen the proven effectiveness of
more time and class.
And it is I submit to you it's
challenging but it's time that
we do the right thing for our
kids in new mexico and just like
bella chandler a kid regarding
teacher give her a round of
applies she's amazing.
Yeah.
She is also a structured
literacy coach at sy jackson in
albuquerque as well as principle
chris cardona and math teacher
roberto salas from the gaskin
school district and las crucials
were there in breasing and doing
these programs and there making
sizable dramatic differences.
As they implement them and I
thank them for their dedication
to the mexico.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I do I applies and I want to
tell you i'm pausing.
That look there are jobs and
careers they're really tough.
As doctors and nurses
particularly over the last five
years look no further.
Then you're public education.
Teachers and principles and
superintendents and social
workers and nurses here I tell
you their jobs are complex they
are.
They are.
And we owe them a great deal
with gratitude.
But we have to come together.
And the priority here is our
kidos and their families.
And it is time.
For new mexico in the same way
that will we put our minds.
To anything we become the best
added in the country.
Why wouldn't we have the best
public education outcomes bar
none in the country well that's
my goal and I hope that it is
yours too.
That.
That.
Yeah.
We all of us including our
school districts all of us.
Have to be accountable for the
results that we desire.
We need to guarantee that the
legislature's billions and
public education are going to
the right places and leaving to
better outcomes.
That's why I am asking for
thirty million dollars to invent
experts in our lowest performing
schools so that we can support
the men and women who dedicate
their wives and careers to
kidos.
To identify with those
challenges are to determine the
right solutions that work for
that school those families those
kiros those educators and our
kids thus vital support to make
the difference.
And it's why one more time.
Everyone.
It's a public system we all have
to be accountable.
Including making sure that the
investments that schools need.
Are meeting them where they need
them.
Because we have to all be
responsible.
To meet the standards that quite
frankly we have already sat.
And whether it's a nutritious
meal or an expanded school year
our parents and kids deserve you
know that our schools and the
legislature and the executive
branch.
Are holding up their end of the
deal.
I.
I.
So we're demanding better and
we're delivering better in areas
including education to health
care to the economy and more.
We need to demand the very same
now in public safety.
Right now.
The leading cause of death.
For our children.
Is guns.
In communities across the state
we have seen the carnage that
results.
And the risk that is ever
present when weapons of war and
frankly guns are far too easy to
obtain.
We've experienced the trauma of
a mass shooting in farmington.
And the tragedy of a six year
old.
Share just this weekend in
hurling.
And while the facts are still
unfolding.
It is clear that more children
or involved in this violence.
We have seen too many ruin
lives.
Far too many broken families two
many stolen futures.
And too many unacceptable too
many small coffins.
This violence is nothing short
of horrific it is tragic and
eight years prevailable
yes.
The.
I.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The.
The.
Yeah.
The.
Enough.
This is the most important work
we're going to do.
Is all the other stuff the jobs
the future the homes the
education meanings we keep keep
the mexican safe.
Now that's why i'm calling for a
gun safety package.
Answer sort of weapons.
This.
Raises the legal purchase for
all guns to twenty one
institutes of fourteen day
waiting period increasing
penalties for felons in
possession of a firearm keeps
gones out of parks and play
grounds and allows law
enforcement officers to now file
extreme risk protection orders
to keep firearm away from
people.
The.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
The.
The.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
The.
Yeah.
The.
The.
The.
And I submit that these are
common sense measures that will
say lives.
We have sonya britain here with
us from album.
A few years ago the sony was
sixteen and argument broke out
at a party.
And she was shot multiple times.
In fact she was shot.
Twelve times.
Twelve times and by the grace of
god.
And with extraordinary health
care she's here today.
Demanding that we do something.
To prevent gun violence and I
want you and I thank her for her
courage her advocacy.
And her commitment to making a
difference thank you.
The.
And just as weight we're not all
in the same page on
environmental issues I want to
be very clear.
No responsible gun owner.
Should be punished or prevented
from exercising their rights.
And no child should ever be put
in danger by a weapon of war
especially one will did by a
person who can't pass a
background check or can't wait
two weeks to get a fire on.
Yeah.
The.
The.
Any gun.
The wrong hands is an untannable
risk that we can't afford.
We know that the violence in our
communities.
Is also frequently committed by
career criminals.
And some of them continue their
pattern of crime while awaiting
trial.
That's why i'm enhancing the
commercial burglary statute to
tree repeat offences like the
pattern that they are.
Because they are and those bad
actors need to be held
accountable in all of our
communities and it's why I still
believe we need a mandate.
For pre twelve attention for
violent and repeat offenders
with again a rebuttable
presumption.
So that dangerous people can be
kept away from the public.
The.
Yeah.
And.
And maybe I haven't done this
very well but this idea isn't
new.
Flood I knew I did some bedded
in the federal justice system
and it works and borrowing
things and make them make better
here is another new mexico proud
tradition so let's take
something that works and apply
it here.
To make sure that we are in fact
keeping every new mexican safe.
It.
The.
And i'm also asking this
legislature to pass mandatory
treatment.
For person's repeatedly entering
the judicial system for elicit
substances and many of these
people thank you.
Many not all many are unhoused
for their own health and safety
and for the well being of our
communities something must
shift.
We need responsible accountable
and compassionate action.
It makes a lasting difference
and that means getting these
individuals the treatment that
they need and quite frankly that
they deserve.
And I believe and given that
we've had some of these changes
and I was the secretary of
health fan and they were tough
lift even then.
But now mandated out patient
treatment strategies and tools
that we know today work.
It is the only way we're going
to interrupt this stomach
challenges that are now ever
present in every single new
mexico community.
So let's be brave and make a
difference.
The.
Yeah.
For these same reasons and to
protect the individuals and the
community i'm also proposing
that we end unsafe practices
related to pan handling on our
streets.
We have one of the highest
pedestrian fatality rates in the
entire country.
In a situation we're drivers and
their children as passengers are
an increased risk and it's not
terrible and we can do something
about it now it's important to
recognize.
As we've been talking about
safety.
That these public safety
challenges don't begin with
violent crime.
And I also want to pause as my
new for those poor guys.
This legislature and give
yourselves the credit that you
deserve all of you.
Because states can't address.
More complex complicated public
safety issues we can't without
recognizing that there ever
changing and the investing in
education and jobs and child
care and housing lifting
families up so they have real
choices.
Must occur.
And my guard you have done that
and i'm asking you to do even
more.
And it's a place of great pride.
Which is also an a mexico thing
pride.
And so don't forget that you
have led the way.
And I would submit both parties
maybe those strategies a little
different but no one here.
Has run from investing in the
strength of the economy and the
efforts in your communities.
And.
Have stood up and said that we
need to do more in public safety
every single one of you.
And that is the place that we
can build from.
And so I just want to remind us
given that you've done such
incredible powerful work.
That these issues they begin
with kidos who don't have enough
support.
To get through school they began
in communities or jobs or scurs
they began even in smallest ways
when failures that affect our
sense of pride as I said in our
state in their private matters.
Me just go yet any.
High school football game at
pride matters it's what drives
us to expand our imagination to
raise our gaze to raise our
standards and a raise our
aspirations.
In the lock of our beautiful
state to shine with that sense
of pride about how we feel about
this state every day.
And that's why today I am also
calling for an aggressive forty
three million dollars statewide
for a clean up initiative.
And that means improving state
properties fixing state roadways
cleaning up trash and protecting
the beauty of our open spaces if
thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It means supporting it enhancing
local efforts that address
litter and referring.
Like the work of mary garwood.
Who's also hit with us today
you're mary is a new carl's bad
city counselor congratulations
mary.
Now she's been sharpening
beautification efforts for years
and her community and she
continues to organize and leave
the annual river blends clean up
along the package river.
She's a hero and river and sound
effect kevin wrap has led
volunteers in hundreds of hours
of work cleaning up hundreds of
pounds of trash.
But by doing this work together.
We can show our commitment and
deepen our connection to our
share at home.
Through all of these actions in
our economy and our
infrastructure housing and
health care education and public
safety we can continue to build
a new mexico that reflects the
pride we have always felt for
state because here's the thing
pride does not mean completely
no mexicans don't ignore
challenges in the hope that they
will fade we don't wait for
problems to disappear through
time and patience alone.
And we don't focus only on the
task of today at the expense of
days to come or tomorrow instead
we envision a brider future now
this is the strength that the
heart of new mexico a place
where new ideas take flight and
breakthroughs are born.
I love this state.
From our beautiful landscapes to
our vibrant culture and to our
extraordinary people all of us.
We are a smart yes that is worth
happy for.
Okay.
The.
We are small but we are my.
We're a small state with big
ideas where an expansive state
packed with creative energy.
A state with the courage of our
convictions and the
determination to see them
through more than our resources.
It's our spirit that allows us
to take on challenges not with
half measures and band aids but
with action that meets the
moment and build the future.
At a time when other states are
focused on what is.
We are committed to what must be
what can be and it economy that
offers a good job and career to
every person in environment that
supports clean air and
extraordinary vistas without
sacrificing the prosperity of
the people who share in its
grander.

education to every one who wants
it that delivers health care to
everyone who needs it the
promote the safety and security
of every person in every
neighborhood state that is
forever forward looking forward
toward the horizon toward what's
next toward what's new.
Toward what is only been a
margin and not realized.
