All right let's go ahead and get
started.
Ready
go.
All righty bang bang
goes the gavel.
Welcome back we are
some of us are still finishing lunch but
we are trying to stay on
schedule we
have we are going to have a little
bit more public comments toward
the end of the day today
but the last of our
to topics
today while we are here in Los
Alamos at the Los
Alamos city
building and a big thank
you again to the folks here in
Los Alamos and
Los Alamos County in Los Alamos
community development corporation
they provided our lunches and we're very
grateful for that today
we're going to finish with
outdoor recreation in Los Alamos
and then lastly talking
about food insecurity in New
Mexico.
That will be a 3 and
then we'll finish up with public comment
will recess until tomorrow in Santa
Fe when we reconvene sharply
at 9:00 so
we have and the rent is the
deputy county manager from Los Alamos
County my saying your last name correct
and yes thank okay great
we have James lever the founder and co
director of endeavor New Mexico
thank you both for being here to talk about
outdoor recreation because we
understand that in our
state we've got all these different
areas that have their
own unique outdoor
recreation Jim knows about
what we got in southern New
Mexico but we know in
Farmington in Los Alamos they're
all and like to house with the
Rio Grande gorge we
know that like the communities are
talking about their public
spaces and ways
to really maximize that and
to bring more people and so
and I'm gonna turn it over to you first
and then we'll go to gym and then I
will have a committee for
questions.
Okay well thank you
really appreciate the opportunity to speak
with you today tells tell you a little
bit about Los Alamos County in our outdoor
recreation that we're very proud
of I'm
here on behalf of so of
our community services director
Cory Styron he
worked also previously in Farmington
for many years on recreation
amenities and
he's just out of town this
we get a conference but I'm
also joined here today
with R.
us parks and outdoor
recreation superintendent Wendy
Parker our
outdoor.
I'm sorry open space and
trails a
specialist Eric Peterson
and our
assistant superintendent
of parks many of the
tech.
They are and they
and and if you and if you
ask me questions are too hard
and I called a friend all
right
so so
with that I I handed out a
presentation and I'll go
ahead and just dive right
into
slide number 2
or page new on the backside
there and I apologize there's a little
kind of some filler pages that didn't
mean to print but
on the up outdoor
recreation overview
we do have
between the county and some of the
Santa Fe National Forest
of land here we have
75 miles of trail
and in addition to
that it's
also 5000 feet of
elevation change between the
Rio Grande and Kabyle
mountains summit so
it's a wide variety
of trails summer very
challenging and
summer very multi use
and ADA accessible
and and very
highly use and you
might bring in the Mike for just a little
bit closer to you
thank you so much absolutely
want to make sure the people who are watching
on the webcast and can hear you
clearly okay
okay is that better that's better thank
you okay
and then I also handed out just
our handy dandy trail map to
give you an idea
of our 22
areas
in both the town site
and also down in white
rock
on the amount of trails we
have in this community
and it's just a huge asset
to us to be able to from
almost any point be able
to help out of
wherever you are and and have
a trail within close
proximity.
If you skip forward to the skill
help ski hill
slide an
additional amenity that
we really enjoy is is
the ski hill it is privately
owned but it is
used for a year round
experience
and it has a lot of potential
for expanded
opportunities about
750 acres with about
44 trails access
by the ski lift
but what we're really focusing on
is no making for a more
predictable and extended ski
seasons for increased
a ski pass sales it's
also been critical for
us in terms of the kind of
reservoir up there and we use
it for firefighting we all know that
fire a wildfire is a big
threat to our
outdoor
wilderness and forest
in in New northern New
Mexico
and we
in addition to that
we're really kind of focused on all
abilities and trying to fill all the
niches for all abilities in terms of
mountain biking hiking
can't but
we are limited on
some of our infrastructure
around and I'll get to that
slide later
and then we often we
also combined a lot of our outdoor
here I'm gonna talk a
little bit about some of the
special events that kind of
dove tail in with our outdoor
recreation but it's hard not to
come here and enjoy the community
without not wanting to out
I also enjoy the outdoor
recreation.
So
these are not necessarily
traditional outdoor recreation
for economics but
for us they
do have a really strong tied
to visitation in our
tourism we do
have during our summer months our
summer concert
series.
On the if you switch
to the next slide
and we've done some
analytics on the visitation
of outside of Los Alamos of the
numbers listed there
are 4
people coming into the community
those are for
those events that's in addition to the
people in the community and
join those events
and
the reason that's of interest to
us.
I should say it's not just the coming summer
concert years we also have a
unique outdoor ice rink and
one of the things that
both our community and
people who've come have
said that how unique of an
experience that is to be able to
ice skate while you're
out being able
see the trees see this
guy and the
ice will staff come up to
play a game here for 2 years
and that's very
successful
event
and
we also have
I included the golf course
because it
is again an amenity
where. Some
of these
are what we've seen is the
trending up of the uses
especially post comment everyone
wants to get outside and
they want to be able to still
enjoy themselves and recreation and
how important that is to not
only
the locals but also to bring
their friends have something to do
and also for mental health
how important that is
to be able
to access those especially in
challenging
times.
So I I through the next slide in
there that says tore it says
tourism stats
it might be a little hard to read
but back in
2018 pre pandemic
we and ever done
to doing a tourism
strategic plan poll of
our residents
and the top 3
responses to
why might you tell a friend
to come to Los Alamos was
outdoor recreation adventure
national parks
and the natural
scenery and so we
value those very highly
and here in Los Alamos and want
to protect them and enjoy
them.
In parallel with
that.
They're also when asked what
we really need to improve
to support these it was more
restaurants
and more local
businesses
to support and
recreation and entertainment
activities that go along with
those and that's where we're really
challenging get all I have
a slight on that later but
that tied between
not only having the outdoor
recreation but the support
infrastructure is very important to
us.
The next slide is really
just sort
of an overview
of some of the the data
coming out of data I
I will highlight one of them in
the next slide and so
you can see it but if
you kind of in the middle the side you see
the circle we'll
that's important for us because
what it highlights is that
36 over 36
percent of our
visitors are only staying for
a day. And
there's a lot of reasons for that so
I'll talk about that
but
we want them to obviously stay
more than a day.
On the next slide which says monthly
volume of visitor
days that's
just a blow up of one of those grant
from data I and
just gives you kind of an idea
of we're
still sort of in
a recovery phase
from pandemic
tourism numbers and
visitors
but this
was we see it come
trending up this summer
was we certainly
saw us getting back
to pre pandemic
tourism numbers if
you go to the next
slide
what's interesting to this is this is
data collected from our visitor
center.
And 2022
you'll see that the majority
of the visitors
continue to be Bandelier national
monument and
we've we've known for quite some
time that because we don't have good
connectivity
between bandolier and
white rock where we have our visitor
center to the town
site we know
that with of state
trips they're not coming
up here and spending time it's
it's really they're just coming in
and leaving.
And but
what's also interesting
if you go to the next 1
for the partial year of
2023 visitation
it goes through July but you can
see an uptick
in some
of our history museums and I
think some of you
are where there
is a movie came out
called Oppenheimer
and this only goes up through July
so what what I've
been given a a
preview.
Of fire economic development
ministry down under later is
that what we're seeing now
is
record numbers at our museums
and cultural sites but
there and bandolier staying
flat and so what
we so we don't really
don't think they're doing both people
are canal coming here for different
reasons. We
would like them to come here for multiple
reasons.
And so.
The next slide
is talks
about lodgers tax revenues
and and the only point I make here
is that are larger taxes
generally for fairly flat
and that's because quite frankly
we have limited capacity
and
it's it's largely
full and not at
least usually by torrez but
also by contractors in town
and things like that and
so again
all it's one of our challenges
is just a capacity
to even
accommodate the
visitors it and that we
would like to have stay here more than
one day.
So the last 2 slides
all talk about is just our ongoing
challenges
nothing new but I think it's important
to point out that deferred
maintenance due to shortage of operation
staff and workforce housing
is pretty critical we
we have the jobs
we have the ability to do the deferred
maintenance we don't have
the either the
the people who want to come up to do the
work or be employed in Los
Alamos in those types of
jobs
and we do have limited
hotel are being camping
infrastructure that people are looking
for
and
because
as you know we we have a large
employer in town a lot
of people travel up here to work
during the week so a lot of
our
the restaurants
and support
amenities they're open
during the week day during the week
but it's they don't see that
same type of traffic
on the weekends or
evenings and so
therefore they're not always open and
so it is kind of heartbreaking when we
see torrez in here and
a lot of places are closed and we
we really need to work on that
to support the.
The tourism and
of.
Again as a related topic for
us and but that is just working
regionally on some
of our shortage of
bus
drivers and being
able support people getting
around to the amenities enjoy the
outdoors without necessarily having
to be built peak big parking
lots we still have room for it
and would really like to limit
having to do that.
Salt all
just.
And then the last thing is just we do
have some with the increased
use of our trails
E. bikes and
some of those things we have a
questions we
have
offer vehicles are off
highway vehicles all of those
sometimes create conflicts
so were
struggling a little bit to know how to
manage the different uses
and I'll just wrap up with we
think that the our effort
to really being put into partnering
because we these are a lot of
regional issues and we think
that that solutions are
gonna be much stronger regionally
working with are
adjacent pueblos
are chasing counties
are the land all as as a
major employee and looking
at some of these impacts
but again it all comes down to
the reason a lot of people really love
being here is the outdoors
and and and why
that makes this a quality place
so with
that
I guess I on the
last slide I
just mentioned quickly
of
the.
The importance of how this all
plays into healthy living and
help us almost tend to rank
very high is a healthy place to
live we also
are really focused on
a lot of our infrastructure is old
and it only it is
really not inclusive for all
abilities and how important that
is so. The
transit with access
the design of all
abilities and then also
just the connection with
healthy living we think is a really
important story that New
Mexico has an amazing
resource for us and
we need to protect it but also we
want to enjoy it so with
that thank you
and.
We are also there's
a New Mexico outdoor economics
conference coming up in
Santa Fe so additional plug for that
September 23 through 20 fifth
and we we think it's
so important we decide co sponsor
that event
so thank you very
much.
Thank you mistaken for the
money.
And I. Hi
provided the other hand out for
you. So
I'm gonna go first.
Madam chair and committee members thank
you all because what the
legislature is done over the last
few years to really bolster
the outdoor recreation economy in
New Mexico is
second to none so if
you don't Pat yourself on the back
and give yourself applies right now you
can do it later when you're home have money or
something like that but it's
really phenomenal to
see what you guys are doing time
I'm going to talk a little bit about the
statewide outdoor recreation economy
specially from the job career side
of it because everybody gravitates
to the experiences I getting
outdoors we know we love that part
we have the opportunity to build
a thriving outdoor recreation
economy and get our kids
to be able to stay in their towns
doing jobs and careers
related outdoor recreation and I
know that
exit that they do often times
that exit is is this something we
fight so my
topic today is expanding New Mexico's
outdoor recreation economy
and actually we're 3 different
hats so one had
is on the founder and
executive director of
endeavor New Mexico which is the state's
outdoor recreation business alliance
think of us as the chamber of
commerce for all the outdoor
recreation businesses the state New Mexico
we had over 230 members join
us from all over the state from
mom and pop fly fishing to
Ted Turner's vermeil ranch and
everybody in between so it's been really
exciting to become that
voice for these
small businesses who need
our support the other had
is I'm also consultant
and I've been working with rural communities
and state New Mexico for many years and
my main focus is to
help communities build outdoor
recreation economies that's
my passion took me 45 years
to get here but I'm now there so I'm
not leaving it and the last
hat that I wear is I'm also an
advisory board member to the state
office of the outdoor recreation division
and have been since day one
so I'm kind of privy to a lot of things
going on especially in the trenches
to help our economy's growth
next page there for
you wanted to
check quickly about the film industry
we now take it for granted
that we have a vibrant film industry
but once again it was a legislators
that help pull that together I
went out looked at this
statistic in 2004
New Mexico was doing
$40000000 worth of
film production.
And 2022
we did 850
$5000000
so I like to use the slide show
that when you guys put your
heads together decide to make something
happen it can happen so I'm
really excited about the
state being behind
outdoor recreation the next
slide shows you to companies maybe
you've heard of them osprey
backpacks maybe some of you on
Ospreay or smartwool
socks
those are 2 major
outdoor recreation grants
manufactures that started
in small towns in
Colorado so
the point I try to make here is
that doesn't matter what size a
town we have in New
Mexico it could be Roy
it could be Albuquerque and everything
in between there
if there is an entrepreneurial
culture and mindset there to
support somebody's idea to
get an outdoor recreation company
off the ground I think we can make
it happen just like they did in
Colorado the
next slide is a picture
from the outdoor retailer show
where all of the major brands
get together and
if you have a flannel shirt drink
craft beer you're in there's
no real hard membership
to get in but 1200
brands get together
annually and the New Mexico
partnership up until recently
has attended that to say Hey
New Mexico as a state is
open for outdoor recreation
businesses so it's exciting to
see but there is
a problem if you see the next
graphic at the outdoor
retailer show attended a seminar
and this is a startling
statistic.
Every day our kids are
spending 7 to 9:00 hours a day
on digital devices
and they're spending 79
minutes a day
outdoors.
countrywide
70 6000000 jobs
59.$2000000000
in state and local tax
revenues for New
Mexico it was
a 2.$3000000000
industry in
2021.
And it created
28475
jobs.
And so you know
we we talk about
the youth I don't know if you're familiar
with this group Jim but it's the
semi a project and they do a lot
of stuff outdoors in
these young people who are
really
embracing what can be done outdoors
and also highlighting just the outdoor
economy.
And and protecting our public
lands I do want to give
kudos to Representative Johnson
who is also part of that group
for the outdoor equity
fund and
for those of you who also supportive of
the legacy fund
you know we have another another thing
called the land and water conservation
fund which was
fully funded
beef I think it was
2018 fully
funded and
now the full amount
that was designated to a
1969 which was
$960000000
was only actually.
Pardon me.
Included in that fund
twice.
Minutes life
since 1969
and it in the
last couple of years that is now fully
funded in the past
Congress would only put
460000
$460000000
to communities and so
many of our communities have public
parks and public spaces have
trails
those things are funded with matches
from local city governments to be
able to improve quality of life
and so the land water conservation
fund also helps with those
things
but and you bring up some
really interesting points
because you know
you talk about the infrastructure and
how you wanted to grow
but if you don't have places
for people to eat and people to
stay.
It's like you're
you're. Out of like
making your creating the mud that you're
walking in right
and so it's like you know how
can you
thoughtfully move forward
in order to embrace this
kind of money
that can come into your
community
but also that you're
you're you're participating
in practical
growth.
And so I I
hope that their resources and
conversations that can be
provided for you to help
us
because.
It certainly is something that I think our
communities all over all of us
know that the no the gems in our
different communities and we want
to be able to share this with others but we
also don't want people to ruin in
either
so we have to think about that
so Representative
Duncan Miller to go first and then
Representative Ortez Representative
Zamora is anybody
else just
holler.
Thank you madam chair
thank you for your
presentation
a few years ago I I do the
iron horse and
and.
At the when I
finished my wife
was there at the end
of the park and
solar tenancies tried to take my
bike away and I said please don't
fall
over.
But it that
is just an
incredible
a race ride
for me
but you see people from
all over the world
at that and
and that's how
we can do the same thing here in our
state
my daughters have a
aboard and and it
has 1000 hours
is what they have to get out every
year. And and
that's what they do and
and no
no TV no
cellphones it's outdoors
and so we feel
strongly about that might my
grandkids just finished up
the
the
the
children's.
I guess it's a
course that they can take
a ride over the humps
and stuff like that in
Farmington and my 2 year
old granddaughter was honor strider
doing at and and
so this can
affect every age
I'm not young and I'm still writing
my Scott's both mountain
and road bike and
so we can write
this for a long long time and
and especially those of us
that you know have any
problems or have problems of
so I applaud this
and and I'm I'm I'm in
your corner whatever I can
do thank you madam
chair. Thank you
representative Representative
Ortez thank you madam
chair thank you so much for the
presentation
I've been working.
In conservation
specifically focus on connecting
young people the outdoors for about 20
years now so I
really I've
seen the ships
and the investments that we made
in the state and other states have
made in making sure
that kids are you connected to
the outdoors and their
programs for them
including other equity
fund and all of
that.
So and I really applaud and I think we
need to continue to do more of
that.
I also represent a
community
house that
is struggling
with
how outdoor recreation
and our focus and our investment
outdoor recreation has an
impact on
traditional communities
we had a pretty pretty
big discussion
around trails trails
on lands that you know our
public lands on you know
owned by the by us through
the for service
and how additional trails
or you know fixing up the
existing trails
would really
affect those communities
that are
that are directly across the
street and
in those robust conversations
it became very very
clear that
we must
always be
considering
neighbors
traditional folks
and what their
experiences are
with an increase
of really high impact
outdoor recreation including mountain
biking some of my
best friends are mountain
bikers
you know I think it's
true I you know I
support outdoor recreation I know
it means a lot for a comedy but it's
also killing
some of our communities are
absolutely loving these lands
to death is having an impact on
water quality on
privacy and all of that
so I'm
asking both of you to
tell me a little bit about
how you are
we these
considerations as
you ask for more funding for
outdoor recreation which I
very much support
how do you take community
input you know
into that request
what do you what are you doing and how are you
leading the industry and ensuring
that those voices are heard and we can
have plans that
include everyone including the people
who live on those
lands.
Thank you for that question
because it does come up here
is it is it
hot topic for us public
engagement
and not only just with our
own community who were very
fortunate is naturally
engaged
it is with our our neighbors
as well and and so
what we've been trying to do
is.
Manages just through
balance and
balance of
not making quick decisions but
making informed decisions
making inclusive decisions
and also recognizing
that.
Not one decision
fits every location
they have to there's a lot of
nuanced decisions you can
make so one of
them is we've
worked hard not to
promote and try to
eliminate
continuation of trails onto
public lands because a lot of
times it's not when that's not
desired and so those are
the type of things we have to work with
and protect against that
the other thing is we want to
improve our
trails
to also eliminate social
trails what we find is
that by
improving our trails and
and making them
designing them in a way where they're
intentionally keeping people on the
trail port
trying to get rid of the extra
social trails of people are creating
on their own and
then lastly I
think it's really about
how you use them and how
you manage
them
and so that's part of why we are
interested in not
necessarily bringing in more
cars that are
to our community that have roads
can't handle but providing
a way where you can enjoy the
amenity without doing
that or
and maybe you can rent a bike here
or something of that nature but it
is really a balanced
conversation and we
are finding that
it is really
each of our our
community and and our neighbor
our conversations we've had with
our neighbors
is that you have to be
specific to what the issues
are in that location and that's
just really important not to have
any kind of just.
Pat answers that we think we can
apply in all
circumstances.
And and I'd like to
add there's a lot
of conversation about that the joke
out there's like nobody wants to be the next
my web. If
you've been through mail I've recently it takes
you forever to drive that stretch
of road
the outdoor recreation roundtable the
national organization comprised
of the largest
associations and manufacturers
of outdoor gear and
a couple years ago they came out with
something called the rural
development outdoor
recreation tool
kit and rural
economy outdoor recreation tool kit a
mouthful but it identified
15 best practices at a
community should look at and
follow if they want
to build an outdoor recreation
economy and basically the questions
up front are what
we want to be and so that
sort of addresses it specially the
task has been at it for a while so that's
a little bit of a different question
but if it's somebody
that's a newbie that's trying to think about
it and it talks about if you're
going to
build your field of dreams whatever
it is and build it they will come kind
of thing you really have to
give a lot of thought to the infrastructure
that's needed to accommodate
even a race that might
happen on weekend versus
just the overload on systems
and other sorts of things and so
that tool kit really
does provide a good
direction for
community
to think about how do we
move this forward regardless of their
size and where they are in fact
the first 5 best
practice relate to you just starting
out the next 5 years sort of under
way and the last I liked
house maybe Hey these are the
things you really have to pay too because
you're you're well into it
and I would be happy
madam chair committee members
to send you that link to the outdoor
recreation toolkit because I and
2.oh is coming out I'm all
excited
and should be released
shortly and it
will share a lot of things
and answer a lot of questions they could
lease the strategically tactically
how to move forward on on the
questions that you just
have a great if you can send that to Erin
and then she'll go ahead and send hi
Erin and James
she's bond selling
K. we got
thank you for that I appreciate
those those answers I just
you know want to let my colleagues
know that you know I
think you should take we should take a
lesson from communities like to
house you know I know that Gallup
struggles with this as well
and you know Silvercity in a
place where they. There is you know
be a beautiful outdoor recreation
opportunities
when you bring people in from other places
and you count on those people for
your economy you
have to really consider the people
who are from the
places that you know that
you're driving folks to
we there are some really
hard lessons learned
with the help of
trails
plan put forth
by the U. S. Forest
Service
and it was a product some
ugliness from from all
kinds of folks and I think it it
really comes from a place of
you wanting to protect our
beautiful special places
for our own community
and recognizing that we
you know we need dollars
from other places so that
we have good roads
and and good trails
so you all in
this by saying you know
please pay attention
please don't
try to rush the process
of of engaging your own
community on outdoor recreation
it's really important it's really
amazing and can bring
in some really you know good
dollars from all of the places
but if you don't
have the community
support your
it's going to fail and it's
going to it's going to continue to
exacerbate the divide
within community
processes take longer when you're
engaging.
Whole communities they
just do so
you know thank you I support
outdoor recreation I love
it I will continue to work on
it but I am
I'm now much more mindful
of the impact it has
on my local communities
thank you.
Thank you Representative Ortez and
to add to that the business
community because you have to have that
infrastructure in order to handle
that traffic in
order to provide the services to
people who are enjoying this outdoor
spaces.
So I appreciate that that
connection as well Representative
Zamora and then Senator
levels.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you presenters so kind
it kind of get into the weeds
a little bit about.
The trails
themselves I
mean you are they all
on public land are their
own forest
are there some a wilderness
are there.
Some do this is
December across private
lands and and how do we
manage all
that.
Well the answer is
yes.
And.
The church and the answer is yes and
then that is a big deal between
the access to the public
land that goes to private land
and so forth and so it's an issue
everywhere and it's funny
because some federal agencies
are really good to work with and others
in the same state art
and I hear that from my communities we
like our bill them though
we know
so it really is a
challenge to get trails built
and sometimes and and and I
think it's different for every community
least that I've seen out there that they
all have different experiences
some private landowners like yeah
come on through and others like no
way so it just depends
on
the mindset of that region as
to how they'll embrace the outdoor
recreation.
Thank you for that thank you madam
chair and so
then my next question goes
to. Who
who would only use trails
being that that somebody
best some money in it.
And then the trail
really belongs to the Forest Service
but you're investing money in
it. And
then who's
responsible
for the safety of the public
and and the liabilities
that come along with
with having everybody
on.
It's a really great question for
us
our trails are on public
land it's either
federal land or it's County
land
and we do struggle
with it's not always
evident when you're leaving one
and entering another
unless you really understand and
look for the signage type
differences and or
relief study the map of where
those boundaries fall
in so for the but
but we are fortunate that were somewhat
of a small
county we
used to have a really
great
access to volunteers to
help us kind of manage some of
those things.
Volunteer time and
the age of the volunteers has become
more of a challenge for us they're much
less available
and the
and so we are looking
actually to have team to increase
staff to to take care
of our trails because
we don't have the volunteer base
we used to have but it is
an ongoing
management and
outreach
and TLC that needs to
happen on these trails
for shore
and and so
what we're trying to do is also
look it and created
a new master plan for
trails and implement
techniques that minimize
some of those
potential
maintenance ongoing
maintenance and use some really
could strategies that are
actually improve
well we're doing the improvements are actually
creates solving some of
the issues
are the environmental impacts and
actually going in a
positive direction rather than a negative
direction on the environmental
impacts I don't know if that answers your question
but that's what we're going
through
I I will say that
another challenge we have is
that we have
folks that sort of feel
like it's their backyard and not public
land and
so we do have some folks that kind
of take that ownership
on themselves and and
and so that's a little bit of a challenge because
and we have to get into a dialogue
about you know
what what has to happen or why
but but it
is.
It is a real issue because
we which is not think we
have people Rangers
patrolling our our trails
and and we also have
wildfire concerns to we
had an issue in the during
the last fire where
we close the trails for safety
reasons because we didn't feel like we could
evacuate someone quickly
enough and that was very
upsetting
to our community and we
actually have people volunteering
to help you know kind
of keep keep an
eye out for any potential
fires to make sure that
we can keep our trails open
so. Thank you
for that thank you madam chair
and and how does game and
fish work with you guys.
Had there do you work with
one another is that too is
just separate
separate things are
are interactions with game and fish is
largely relate to wildlife
and bear in and and
the interactions or
or.
Yeah not so much stress okay
thank you madam chair and thank you
presenters thank
you for that I appreciate that one thing I
was thinking of is there's the conservation
corps of New Mexico and
they help
support staff
to go and do trail
maintenance Anthony
Thomas is
the head of that he's
also a member of my board of
directors to my
job you know
but also it you know something to
think about is the friends
of the organ mountains in Los crucis
worked with one of the local high
schools and they
developed an outdoor youth
club and part
of that was to
understand trail maintenance in the
pool in the and and so there might
be some opportunities I
I you know your community
better but I was just those are some of the
ideas that we've used in
Los crucis
in order to help kind of
number one educate
young people about it
also working with the semi a
project and they've been
a fantastic
resource
and then trying to
create more younger folks
to volunteer protect our public
lands.
Get to.
Just a had 2 examples
come to mind as a vendor Gallup and
beyond and the Santa Fe that tire
society in these are sort
of almost like public private
partnerships because
they want to see the enhanced
trails and they're willing to come out
and do the work
and so they partner with
federal agencies a partner with
K. counties and cities
and they will
oftentimes it even to the requests
coming through trails plus go out to build
the trails maintain the trails and
sort those sort of things because
they're really friends of the
trails and they can
they're adding in the case of Santa Fe
area tens of
miles here and there and so
it's it's really it's so you
just have to build that partnership in
the relationship with the ones like you
were talking about and they will come
out if they know that their
loved.
Representative Zamora just a
cliff it most of the public lands
are managed by the National Park
Service for the bureau of land
management so those are
the agencies when it comes down to like
the trails in the monitoring
of the outdoor spaces now when
there's a bear on that trail
that's a checking game
efficient.
Madam chair if I may I
did have a constituent come
up to me one time and and
he'd like to ride
the wilderness at the
a difficult.
And his issue was
that there was a bunch of down
trees at that time and
who are called
to clean to clean up the
the trails and who's responsible
for it yeah that's
usually the managing agency of that
area so to the BLM of
the National Park Service
thank you madam chair.
Thank you so much Senator
Lopez was at
all from you you're you're
done okay great
thank you madam chair and I appreciate
the presentation and I
wanted to say what kind of data with
our Representative forces
also because those are
serious
issues of concern
we need to look at the different
communities in our state
and I also wanted
to take a long on that to with
regards to our land grant in a
secular communities
especially here in northern New
Mexico
having served madam chair on that
committee for a number of years
there's always been concerns
about a person's
accessing their
lands
the good the bad and the ugly
with that
so as you
working
with.
I know. Los
Alamos County does that necessarily
have
land grants for state that are
engaged I would think here in
this area but
they're just to the north
and of course our seculars and of course
you should look at the statewide
endeavor
are are the land
grants part of the conversation
are they participating with you as
well as CSX
yes.
Representative Lopez I don't
I don't have that answer I don't
believe we have those kind of
conflict issues are
interactions are largely with the
public and protecting the cultural
sites identified and then
also working with the national laboratory
as well
and so I think we're a little more
confined
but
it's I guess
I'll look behind me to see
if anyone on my team once
has additional information on
the.
And we're and we're typically
approach like place like
quest to more on others
they'll be some champion in that
community that wants to try to do something
so we've not work formally
with any Land Grant
organization but we work with
individuals within those Land Grant
areas who are trying to do
something to benefit their
community for instance and more
they were thinking about trying to open a ski
shop so when the Texans are coming
through to head up to angel fire
they can get their gear there rather
than granting it up in angel fire so
those are some of the examples
of working with those kind of communities
in a in a general sense but nothing
specifically that I've ever
been approached
by.
I'm thank you madam chair and I would
just encourage you
to maybe
outreach there's a
land grant council it works
out of the university of New
Mexico and
they have of course there
network was all the different
land grants in the state
and as you know we have common
lands and such they're associated
with the land grants throughout
primarily northern New Mexico
but I know that's what it the endeavors
that they to look
forward as
to how to
encourage.
I think access but
also making sure that they're still
as Representative Ortez
was speaking about
you know taking care of the
environment
because madam chair there's been
you know concerns of people just
coming in
thinking this is a great place for
us to go in the outdoors ago
with their 4 wheelers and everything
else that may ruin because of
the the issues between
County B. element all the different
lands specially in the mountain
areas but again part of that
madam chair is also
Land Grant community
so I would encourage you to please
keep that in mind.
And of course yes secular
Association there's over 700
a secular just in the state of New
Mexico and they are
in southern New Mexico to
your the Honda valley and all
the others as you go
down south but
up here up north when you talk
about access to the
outdoors people think of the
mountains so I would
strongly encourage you to make sure
that there's some communication or
outreach and again
madam chair the Selangor
council out of the university
of New Mexico that could
possibly help and point
you in a direction
at least for conversation and
it kind of outreach thank
you madam chair.
Thank you Senator Lopez and
and you know yesterday we
had a really vibrant
conversations with
the folks from towers Pueblo
talking about you know the
tourism opportunities but also
the preservation opportunities
and some of these are common
things that we're hearing about
you know the preservation of
what our communities want
and also just the
opportunities for economic
growth so
you know each community has their challenges
before them
and we wish you the best but we hope that
there's been some connections if you want
to make any other comments at
all madam chair thank you I just
want to this is here apologized
Senator Lopez from is addressing
is Representative that was my
mistake.
That's okay if I could
madam chair just one more
question did
the movie Oppenheimer
have any effect here in Los
Alamos County I had to ask
them.
Yes Senator Lopez
we of the summer have
seen a significant up
uptake at mostly our
museums and our cultural
sites are are
cultural museums
and tours
in the town site but not so
much for open space or
recreation related but yes
the summer has been
and is visibly noticeable
like you know living here
walking around the community we see
people
walking around in that the town
site and I've alluded to
it earlier but it is a little
sad because I wish more was
open for
them to enjoy
the community but I know our
our museums are
amazing.
You know just thinking that's something
that that might be really interesting we had
a conversation presentation
in this committee in
Los crucis from the film department
and they
took me in many of you may remember
it like when the head of
the film department talked about
different locations and all the different
movies and how there's been an increase
in
marketing is something that that
I enjoy and get to do a great deal
and I was like you should do it did you see
that type thing
and that would be something that would be perfect
just like you could take clips from the
movie and
make like little historical
placards of the clip from the
movie in the actual
site location
and then be like a whole social media
campaign for you
altogether.
Yes madam chair and I would say
that I think it's a great
regional opportunity to because
although there were sites in Los Alamos
there were a lot of sites throughout
New Mexico and that could be a
great.
Partnerships yeah I I
think so too I'm gonna follow up with
the the film department because
we we all know
yesterday also talking about dark
winds and
just the increase and
indigenous representation in our
media just that
we we have so many places
that I know of I'm not the only
one when I see a movie that I know that
was filmed in New Mexico like all I've
been there.
And I think those are some of the things
that can happen here especially you
know still capitalizing on the success
of Oppenheimer
so thank you both for
your presentation today we're very
grateful for
that.
You've got you've got your your cycle
socks on.
While working with they're not
in the webcast together like raise
it above your head.
So that they'll go right in that
line so here's we gonna
start working on your yoga
representative
Duncan.
Too much information
you can tell that we're getting to the end of
our interim session
thank you both for that we appreciate
it greatly we do
have if Katie
and share your here
come on
down.
We really do need to get theme for
the price is right
wasn't make house prices
right
but but but.
But but but
I.
Yeah that's not gonna happen
often.
Thank you so
much.
All righty so we're
talking about food insecurity
and and
you know we've had we've had presentations
on this before in a
in this committee
you know we often talk about
food desert's but I think
both of you are very familiar
with we love the
desert it's our
home and so there is
a famous really
well known well
respected
black farmer in
on the east coast named Karen
Washington
who coined the term
food apartheid.
And it makes much more
sense because we all
love the desert and when
you say something is a food desert
it's kind of saying that the desert is a
bad thing and
we all agree that the desert isn't
a bad thing and so the food
apartheid actually makes more sense
because we're talking about
how the majority of our
state is experiencing
food insecurity or doesn't have
access to healthy food
and and so
I'm really grateful for
this you know I'm involved in
this a lot with Pam
Roy
in all sorts of folks who are doing
incredible incredible
work so
thank you we've got Katie Anderson
who's the president of the New Mexico
association of food banks
and also the chief program
officer for the Roadrunner food bank
which is statewide organization
you work with our group yes of the pedigree
knows. And then
sherry Hooper who is
executive director of the food
depot and I know that we
walk in similar certain we walk in the
same circles and
so
were you in Los crucis was
last week we before
with Pam and the whole crew down
there and
get.
What yes she
was there and I got to go and say
hi to everybody and talk about what we're
doing in the legislature some of
turn it over to you know let you let you
do your your thing so thank you very much
for being
here.
Correct like
that.
Directional mikes so you'll want to
point toward you to
sherry when you talk we
only want to have one Mike on at a
time because if you're noticing
right now we're getting a little bit of
feedback so
I have the power to turn a few
weeks
but Katie
you're gonna go and speak first and
then and
then sure what you go next
but sure you're Mike you'll want to bend
down a little bit as a directional
microphone there you go Arcadia
good governance thank you
madam chair members of the committee thank
you so much for letting us come
and see you today and share with
you some of
some of the challenges and also
some of the winds that are
happening we didn't want
to bring just sad things.
But one always you know be the
the the bear sad
news so
I'm going to get us started of
course sherry
Hooper is just
an incredible advocate for
hungry people in our
state I'm so
lucky to get to work with herself
want to call that out and what a wonderful
person she is
so we're gonna start really quickly and
I know there's a lot of information
I will be quick and I will also
probably kind of gloss
over some of it
really quickly there's a map
provided of the New
Mexico association of food banks
as a group of 5 food banks that work
together to cover the state
of the road runner is
the feeding America
affiliate or member food
bank the other
food banks we all work together to
ensure that every single
corner of our state is
covered and has
food access.
So hunger food insecurity
continues to be an issue for New
Mexicans very unfortunately
I want to call out really quickly I
think sometimes people
hear hunger
and don't I think about
you know when you've had early
breakfast in a late lunch
you know we've all experienced
physiologically we've experienced
hunger food insecurity
is at a different level where
you have an entire household
it is experiencing hunger
together because they don't know
where their next meal is coming
from there's not enough
money available to buy
more food after the
family. Of
the US right right now
for for hunger is
10.4 percent in
New Mexico we're at
13.5 percent
so it is heightened in our
state
17 of our
counties have
a hunger or food
insecurity right above
that 13.5
percent the 2
highest are McKinley County
at 20.9
percent and Luna
County at 20.6
percent so both of those
counties do experience very
high high levels of food
insecurity the very bottom
of that slide
which will be a lot easier to see obviously
online is a list of the
17 counties that
are higher than 13.5
percent.
In terms.
Yes
Sir.
Yes I am so
sorry yes
number number 3
I my number 3
yes.
I'm sorry I thought we were gonna have it up
some more so I would not
have provided you such
small that's
right this is this is also
available online
but yes those are going to just
for reference so yet so
this is where we actions right here
right now and
I bottom of page 1
brought slide number
3 perfect and
what I'll do is say what slide I moving
to have up that that sounds great
awesome thank you so much
so moving on to slide
for about
280 2000
New Mexicans experience
food insecurity or hungry
in our state 90000
of those are children
1 in 5 children in our
state are hungry
18 seniors
and 1 in 7
overall I so
there are a lot of people in our state
that are impacted by
food insecurity.
The root cause of the hunger
in our state of course our food
insecurity is
is poverty we have very
high poverty rates in our state
the map on number
5 all
of those dark red
is where actually
it is in excess of the New
Mexico poverty rate of
18.4 percent
so as you can see it's a
pretty significant
part of our state and
very much in rural
communities which is one of the
reasons that we wanted to talk to
you all with that rural
rural element there that
rural areas of our
state have a lot of
challenges in terms of getting access
to food.
I move on to 6
so the pounds distributed
by food banks in New
Mexico this is a graph
of how many pounds we have
distributed since
2016 up
through fiscal year
2023
with missing meals
above it with the red
line as you can
see the only
time that we have
been able as a
food bank network and
all of the other wonderful
food options
available to people was in FY
20.
And one of the reasons why was
because there was a lot
of food coming in from the
USDA and they
also have the Corona virus
food box program coming
in which provided millions and
millions of pounds to our
state it is the only
time in the history
of us since we've
been tracking these numbers that
we've actually been able to meet
the missing meals
unfortunately as you're seeing the
line is going back up
and we are anticipating
that with the increase in
inflation rates for
food in particular
and also the decreased poundage
that's available to food
banks that that gap
will will widen and we'll
see it widened into the next
couple of years.
Wait to move to number
7.
So very quickly I just wanted
to we wanted to share that with you
all that the food that
the food banks receive
we really have 3 main
sources are historically
have had 3 main
sources
but warns that you're seeing there
is donated food
so that is a
combination of many different
things that can be from retail
grocery stores and can be
from brokers
that can't move a particular
products they give us a
call they can
be a funny
looking vegetables something
simple like that you know be
great vegetables that somebody can't
sell those are all
considered donated for
us so back in
2016 we had
19000000 pounds
of donated food that came
in about a third
of was USDA
commodities and
then a very tiny
sliver was
purchased and
that means that we're going out there
and we're buying a truckload of
food just like Walmart
or Smith's does.
As we got into 2022
I wanted to share kind of the change
we have seen that green
color is
purchased
so we've gone from
purchasing 1
to 2 percent of the food that
we've that we get
out to the communities to
closer to 25 to 26
percent now and
we're paying what
groceries actually we're paying more than
grocery stores pay because
the food banks can't afford to buy
100 trucks at
once.
The red there
is the commodities which have
increased a little bit and
the oranges the donated which
is gone down to 12000000
pounds in that
particular little
circle the big circle
was this year
donated went down to 10000000
so we're continuing to see that
slide
commodities have
gone down a little bit
too. The
green is purchased
which is a gotten even
bigger than last year and
that blue what you see
there is the
funding that was
provided to food banks last
year of $5000000
to help support get food
out to
communities.
Madam chair and members of the
committee I'd like to just expand a
little bit on what Katie
has just shared our
food banks traditionally
relied on donated
food in fact they
were actually our
food banks are actually started in
the 19 seventies
because there was such an
abundance of
food being thrown away by
grocery stores food
manufacturers and others
so people witness that
waste and thought that
it would be the right thing to do
to start food banks and now they're more
than 250 food banks
around the country I
which of course are here in
New Mexico so
what we're seeing now
because we're seeing such a
drop I went explain
why we're seeing a drop in the
speed donations
one is food
manufacturers and distributors
they used to donate so much
food because they would over produce
food it may be that
they wore.
At testing new items on
the market not always
use this example
which really dates me
because I'm old
but I don't know if
you'll remember the brand
craze and everyone's
like oh that's going to solve all
your your health issues
you got to do it and
then people realize that tasted like
order just so they
stopped buying but
just talk about great nuts
right why
not.
But it's in so
after that happened the food
banks of course a lot of brand
products because people were buying
them.
Those those
that the food manufacturers
and distributors have
improved their
efficiencies so
they're not making the mistakes they
used to make that
means then that food banks are not
getting nearly as much from
them that
is an issue we're also
dealing with secondary
markets so
and and not to be offensive at
all that the dollar
stores big lots
those kinds of stores
are also buying up that
surplus product that
normally would have been donated
to food banks
so there's that and then
Katie mention of
the ugly produce well yeah
there's likely produce and guess what
the food banks usually get
that out because
people don't want to
want to buy ugly produce
what we're seeing now is that
there are these very clever clever
people who are actually
starting their own businesses
and they're accessing that ugly
produce and selling it at
a reduced rate
so those are some of the reasons that
the food banks are not seeing
the donations they used to
see and I will share
up with a few depot
where the food bank that we're headquartered
in Santa Fe we
serve 9 counties in northern New
Mexico 40
percent of our operating
budget this fiscal year
is going to purchase food
40 percent that's well
over $5000000
going to purchase food because
we are not getting nearly enough
donated food to
meet the demand for emergency
help.
Thank you sherry so
much.
One of the things that we have
questions about before
and this of course I won't I won't
spend a ton of time on but
about what food support is
available to hungry people in
New Mexico outside
of what the food banks use to
really state and federal nutrition
programs
very quickly gonna go
through of course
you have snap which is supplemental
nutrition is the supplemental
nutrition assistance
program
that is
at family or individual has
to be 165
percent of the federal poverty
line to qualify for
that and it
also is dependent upon
there being a snap
retailer near
that person so
one of the things that we do want to bring
forward and we'll talk about a little bit
more is that our
state has many many
parts where there are
no snap enabled
retailers so there
may be someone who lives in a rural
area that does qualify for
snap but they have to
drive in some cases hundreds of
miles to actually get to a place to
spend or snap so that
is definitely a challenge in our
community.
We have double up food Bucks
which is a wonderful program
to New Mexico farmers marketing
association in fact
half their fire right
here we work closely with
them that
provides $2 worth of
produce for
for $1 basically
they get double the amount
it does great things
one of the challenges for that program
is it is reliant
upon other timing
for farmers markets
and the farmers markets in most of
our state or open
for 6 months they closed
November 30
so that means that during
those 6 months when they're
not open that
produce is not is easily accessible
to community
members.
Snap is a very important
program in our state
of 41.one
percent of children it
are represented by those who
receive snap
27 percent
our families with the senior
someone who is disabled in the
home 47
percent are
working families so
snap is access
to other state 25
percent basically of our
population receive snap on
some level.
I wanted to share it with snap benefits
of looks like I'm sure
many of you are aware
that February
into February this year
the maximum allotment
for sap went away.
And that was because it was based
on the federal
public health order
so starting March 1
there was a pretty significant
decrease for anybody
who receive snap
I did want to call out to the inflation
rate in New Mexico from
2017 until
now about
17.3
percent for
food it was 22
percent.
And they are
guessing or there are I guess they're
predicting at this point that there
could be an additional 5.8
percent increase in
food costs by the end of
2023 so
we're continuing to see that
increase in food costs
that is above the actual
general inflation
rate.
On slide 12
you will see some
pictures
some seniors in New
Mexico these are
single seniors
were receiving a maximum
allotment of
about $291
per month.
As of March 1 of those
benefits dropped to $26
per month.
So if you look at the picture in the top
right that is a grocery
cart with
$26 worth
of product in it
this picture was taken on Monday
so it's pretty up to date.
The picture on the bottom is
$291 with
groceries.
So it's a pretty in my mind
a pretty shocking representation
of the change for seniors in our
state
additionally
about one when you
get out to very rural areas
a lot of the food in those areas
costs 1.5 times
more than a dozen
Albuquerque and this
picture was taken in Albuquerque
at a Walmart choosing
the absolute cheapest
items
so it gives you a sense of of what's
probably happening in a
very rural area
summon as senior single
senior would probably lose
about a third of the product
that's in that top
cart.
When
I had my I had my daughter
help me do that project
together and
it was a very sobering
moment for her I must tell
you she was pretty pretty shocked
by that.
Slide 13 is
a map of our state
and one of the things we wanted
we really do want to bring
bring to all of you and and all the
legislators is that
the food the food bank network
is really essential in our
state for basic food
access this is a map
of our whole state
the little orange stars that you can
see another tiny
are retailers
grocery retailers there about
250 in our
state.
And they are that
includes dollar stores as
well. The
black dots are
over 500 food
bank partners
network partners in New
Mexico
so there are
double the number of food
bank partners in New Mexico
than there are actual retail grocery
stores. And
in many areas you can
see there are lots
of black dots and no orange
stars to be
found.
When we talk about food bank
partners I want to
just talk about who they
are and what they need to the food
banks the food banks could
not do the work they do
it without the help of
these 500 partners
and these partners are
emergency food pantries in
small rural communities
they are kitchens they
are shelters
day care centers
group homes
you name it and so
anyone who has
a few program
within the organization and they're
nonprofit they can
turn to their community food
bank for food
so I wanted to make sure that was
clear and
we're able to the food
banks are dedicated
to seeing that those
partners and
therefore than their neighbors
who are receiving that food
receive the most
nutritious food they can
so we are
really strive to see
that at least
50 percent of our distribution
is and fresh fruits and
vegetables I want
to make sure that's clear because we
now not only are we helping
people with emergency food
assistance but we're
helping them to stay
healthy and we all
know that we have higher rates of
diabetes and heart disease in the
state again so
the food banks are
absolutely dedicated to
seeing that they have healthy
diets.
Thank you thank you.
As we go to slide
14 again these I'm just gonna
go over really quickly
these are programs available to
all ages there's the T. factor
the emergency food assistance
program
people are required to be
585
percent of the federal poverty line
to qualify for T. fat
foods there's a
regional Pharm. D food bank program
and there is the
community food assistance program
which is the program
that that the state
was kind enough to to
provide $5000000 for the
funding through last
year.
Just a touch very quickly
on the regional farm the food bank
program this is a federally
funded program
and I
Senator Hamblin
I'm sure that you heard about it
in Los crucis perhaps I
know that we had people
there who were
willing to talk about it and share
information but it's a
very exciting program for the food
banks to be involved in
because it is providing
several $0 in federal
funds that
is really allowing us
to buy at New Mexico
produced food
and so we have that
we're in the second year of it the
first year was really developing
the program but we've
spent more than
$1000000
of those federal funds
with New Mexico growers
and producers so it's very
exciting to see this
opportunity and we're
trying our best to take full
advantage of federal dollars
that are open or that are
available to the
state.
Absolutely
on slide 15
is a quick chart of
of a U. S. T. A. R. T.
fat commodities that that have
come into our state
since I think and we have all the
way back to FY
14
as you can see it's it was pretty
steadily up until we got to
FY 19
where that began to route to
grow pretty significantly
and then of course
FY 20
and FY 21
had some very high numbers
that weren't is actually the
Corona virus food
box program and that's where
the the all of that
extra of food came
in which got out
across our state
very efficiently and
effectively and
then as you can see as we head
FY 22 in FY
23 those numbers have
dropped significantly
again there
is additional funding that was
approved recently so
some of that food
there's an increase in the food that's coming
in but it's nowhere near
what is really needed
in order to to meet the
need.
In terms of fund of state
and federal nutrition programs most
of these are federal
there are children focused
obviously the school breakfast and
lunch we have
wick wick farmers
market program
we do want to call out really
quickly how excited the
food banks were about the
wonderful healthy universal
school meals that was passed
last year huge proponents
of that such
and such as strong
support of that so we
want to call that out that that was a
great move for our
state
1 of the challenges I do want to
call out as we go through you
know slide 1617 and
18 is that every
single program has different
rules and regulations
and different federal poverty
lines that somebody has to be
at so it
can be very I think
challenging and sometimes frustrating
for people who are experiencing
food insecurity or hunger
to try to navigate that
web of so this
1's 100 65
percent and this 1's 130
percent and this is 100
85 percent and I
have to go over there to get that The
New Mexico for here to get that
we hear that a lot from people
who are seeking
help
and often times what happens
particularly in rural areas
is there is no place that
any of these programs are
available.
Give us
on.
And then on to of course slide
19 there is
the food distribution program on
Indian reservations are for
dipper one of the things I
do want to call out about that
is that for community
members who receive for the
birth they cannot receive snap
or vice versa.
So they have to choose between the
2 I believe that is a federal
regulation
I know that it their conversations
at the federal level about that right
now but I think
judging by reactions we all
think that's pretty
ridiculous
fitted for if that is the with a
different set up and
then there is the fresh R. X.
program I want to call that out that is
a new program under the
food initiative it's doing
wonderful things
and we're very much in support of
that.
So high level food access
gaps across our state
indigenous communities of all
ages.
Serious challenges
there moderately
or highly rural communities
a lot of challenges there
anyone who is struggling
to make ends meet that makes about
185 percent of the
federal poverty line
there's very little
available to them.
Transportation is a
major issue in our state as
I'm sure you are all well aware
of that can I
read what I've written here.
The question
obviously home bound
individuals
that is a challenge for our
state.
They're just a host of challenges
for many different groups
food banks are working
very hard to address those gaps
to the best of our
ability
including building
relationships
across different communities
I know that food depot
has been doing incredible
work roadrunners been working
very hard to connect with
indigenous communities across our
state and say
how can we work together
and find
whatever support is needed
to the community in whatever
way you would like that
support to look
we had great for
movie with him as Pueblo in
particular they're
actually building
a
pantry
and road runner is helping to support
that and find out
funding for different equipment so
that they can have a pantry full
time that came just
so we're absolutely thrilled
about that.
Rural communities in New
Mexico have growing numbers of
seniors I know we all know
this.
1 of the big trends
going on is that the
65 plus
population
I current trends continue
will account for
over 22
percent of our
population by
2030
so making sure that we're focusing
in on seniors
in particular and very rural
places is a
high high
priority.
I'm going to 24 here as
well New Mexico's total
population increased by
2.8 percent from
2010 to 2020
the population of people
age 65 and older increased
by 43.7
percent it's a pretty
incredible number.
Access to food it will continue
to be an issue especially
for seniors in our state
as a number of seniors
increase over the next 7
years and we have
a listing there for New Mexico counties
with the highest percentage of
seniors Katrin is the
highest at
41.6
percent currently was State
are not far behind at
36.4
percent.
It's important to note that as
Katie was talking about the
senior population
what we're saying of course is
that baby
boomers are retiring
and that he will be one
of those soon
hopefully.
But what we're seeing is that
there are ill prepared for
retirement many of
them may lower wage
with low wages throughout
their employment
which did not
allow them then to set aside
money for retirement
and so they're retiring
expecting to live
completely live on
social security
benefits and
what we do know is
that so
security benefits will
likely find about half
of what they need to actually
just meet their basic
needs at
feud food shelter
that's just about it
and we'll need
so and what we see
to is when you have
folks that we we're really
trying to reach we have
such a limited budgets
they pay for what
has to be paid for whether to
rent or house
payment those
utilities that are important to
keep the heat on in the
winter and what we
see is that the most flexible
piece of their budget is their food
budget and
often times when they've paid
those other fixed expenses
there's no money left for
food so we are
absolutely expecting
to see a huge increase
in the number of seniors
who are seeking emergency food
assistance help
and with that come some
unique challenges
we have had we've been out
talking to the different communities
that we serve trying to better
identify what their
specific needs are
so that we're not just making you
know treating every community
the same role communities
versus urban for example
what we're hearing from our
seniors are
one they're absolutely
terrified to cook.
So when we're giving them a lot of fresh
foods and things they're
afraid to cook because they're
afraid they'll start a fire in their
home.
So that's something to consider
when we're looking
at a providing help to
our seniors another
is that I had the funniest
call one day one
of the seniors that we help out
with the the few depot
called and she said
share. She
said this
this fresh foods great but
these cares I can eat them
I don't have any
T.. And
I thought well of course
you know that makes good
sense so now the food
banks are starting to look at how
do we prepare
meals package
those meals and perhaps freeze
them and deliver those meals
to our seniors so those
are just again some of the challenges
that we're facing as
we're seeing a growing
up population of senior
seeking
help.
So in terms of current programming
for seniors on slide
25
the food banks are partnering with
LTSE and providing
some pre boxed food for seniors
and several high need
low access areas
that is happening currently
those food boxes June do
not provide fresh fruits and
vegetables on their all
candle though in some cases that
is that is
preferable
senior specific
programs
to provide fresh fruits and vegetables
are often times tied to farmers
markets we talked before about the
fact that farmers markets and are
available for 6 months out
of the year our
food banks provide
fresh fruits and vegetables year
round in all 33
counties.
We received a lot of feedback
as to sherry
shared out right just wanted to share
this one with you all really
quickly
this was out of love in New
Mexico little
loving of groceries
are so expensive and
we can barely afford
to buy food
I've been taking care
of my elderly parents who
really need
who just recently moved in with
me
it is it's basically as
difficult to navigate our
our food budget
and also caring for
for elderly parents the mother
has dementia and
they're very thankful for all the fresh
produce that they receive from
distributions
there.
So really quickly importance
of recurring funding to
bring this forward
New Mexico has historically
been in the top 5
hungriest states for seniors
and children for many years very
unfortunately
a recurring funding is needed
because increasing food
access through grocery
stores and other
retailers will
not happen tomorrow their
opportunities in on one of
the things that I think the food banks
would really like to advocate for
its continued discussion
at the legislative
level about what can we do
in our state to help
increase access
just 2 simple things like
food in some of the communities
that have really have nothing
basic food access
infrastructure is needed
in many parts of our state
and we really have an opportunity
here to work together to
address these needs in a
really substantial
way.
And what we like to say as well
is that the food banks
bring an existing network
of more than 500 partners
across the state can mobilizing
get food to people very
quickly
we can use the standing
contract that
HSD has with food
banks duty you would just do
a commodities
and we could
continue the opportunity
with recurring funding through
the community food assistance
program which would
allow the food banks to
maintain food levels to the
Congress parts of our
state.
And I'm gonna skip down because I know
we're running running short on
time here
skip down to 33 what
we would like to request the New Mexico
association of food banks
would like to request of
the 2024 legislative
session to be considered
is $15000000 for
food acquisition.
That would bring us to the point of
meeting approximately 89
percent of the meal gap
if the trends continue with
the food that we have available
now coming in
now it would
provide 12.8000000
pounds of food and
that means that there would
be food available to
people in every
single county all 33
counties of our state
for the coming
year.
And I will and there
thank you madam chair and members
of the committee thank you
so much you know I I
I think of you know just
the work that you're doing.
Really just trying to plug
holes in that damn as a
they keep showing up right
and it's you know we're we're seen
in every single county in the
state and
as I've mentioned before bicycle
tire and we're looking
at all the different components of this and
really it's an opportunity
you we we have to look at
you making sure when you say people have
access to healthy food.
Is it to grow their own
food. In
the rural communities
you know it's it's it
is.
Unfortunate that
when people think of
of going to a grocery store that in some
communities their only option is
$1 store.
And then I want to put a
plug in for the healthy food financing
initiative with the
economic development department that was a
bill that I sponsored and Representative
Rubio sponsored
you know we we still will
continue to push for that because
what that does is that provides
funding for if there's
like a small grocery store
like a grocery stand at the
corner of a road in a rural
community that would
allow that would provide access
to healthy foods for their communities
it can it can support that
but also we know our small
farmers have
access and can grow
that food we export
more we
export a bunch
of our food we have to import more to feed
the people who live here
which to me just doesn't make
sense
but when we have the opportunity
support our small farmers
with cold storage
with trucks with equipment
which is what the HFI also
does that we can
support that and help people have
access easier access especially
in our rural communities our
rural communities that are farming
communities
and then also support entrepreneurship
for people who have if they
have if they have
the luxury of having some land
that they can grow their own food
or grow it for their community
so I
appreciate the work you're doing this kind
of never ending.
Because one once you get
one crack kind of plugged
up with bubble gum
another one will show up so
I'm I'm grateful for what you're
doing we have Representative
the market I see representative
Duncan we
what.
He doesn't want today
he doesn't just a question.
Okay all right so
we've got Representative Zamora
that we've got Representative Mason
representative Allison
so I'll get you to
Senator so
the more you're ready to go
first.
Thank you madam chair and thank
the presenters for your
presentation
I'll try to fill.
Representative Duncan
issues will all have a
hard time I'm not I'm not as
long winded.
Madam chair and and
presenters.
You know we could kinda laughing a little
bit but this is a serious
issue. Hi
I hope that the
you.
That we as Representative
legislators
this by the 15000000 we're
spending money on things
that don't.
Our news media is this an
important is
this.
My question is is
where do we get these numbers
about how many children are
hungry and how many face
hunger of those
numbers come
up.
So that primary
location of those numbers
currently is through the
ACS survey for
the American Community Survey
others run to the census
bureau and it's at
5 it's a 5 year average
so they take they
take this information they do
calling throughout the year
and they hit really every
corner of the country
and then they pull those percentages
out based on on the
answers and then they rolled into
a 5 year average
so we
actually have that data
down to the census tract
level and one of
the things that the food banks are working
very hard on right now
is taking that information
knowing really very
specifically where those communities
are where those levels are
incredibly high
and targeting
programming and food
into those communities because we
know that for instance I
believe the highest
of food insecurity right
a census tract in our entire
state is the
Alamo
Alamo chapter of the Navajo
Nation in
the very northwest
corner of Socorro
County
so that is where those numbers are
coming from.
Thank thank you for that
answers
and can a child
in the state of New
Mexico.
Have a
problem.
Such as obese
or
B. B.
not eating properly and
and be too heavy for
his for his
frame or whatever how
Harvard doctor would look at
it and still
be
hungry.
Actually obesity excuse
me. Chair
members of the committee
I get so excited
and our pride in their
so obesity
is actually something that we see
a lot with low income families
and children and
it is mostly
because
that
foods that are higher
in calories.
Are the cheaper foods
and the more expensive foods
are the ones those foods
that are high in
nutritional value
but they're also they're just
very expensive and so
families of course when I fill
bellies.
And so they go with whatever
is cheapest I mean that's
just putting it simply
and we know that hungry
children whether they're obese
or not we know
that they're not benefiting from their
education when they go to
school they
may have upset stomach aches
headaches all sorts of things
that are caused by
hunger and they're
not benefiting as well
as they could from their education
which then of course that some
up for
you to use the word failure but
it sets them up up
to be poor again as an
adult they're not
getting the education and the training
they need to go into
jobs that perhaps would pay
them more living
wage
so
did that answer your question I want
to make sure that the
thank you thank you information
did and it it kind of went beyond
and I like that because
I I always tell my
wife said with that
with the grandkids were raising now
and with the kids that we raised
it's not about fixing them
today it's about tweaking
them all along so
that they can be more successful when
they get there. And
it's we're not going to fix the problem
today but we can tweak
tweak it been that wire
if we bend it too much will break
it. So
so that's that's what it's about
is is about educating
people about eating
healthy and you're exactly
right.
You know we we buy sodas for
grand kids they love
the sodas and we get to spoil them and
send them back home
but but we know it's not good for
them. But my daughter
was drinking a drink the other day that
had fresh strawberries in it
and and and everything
else but I'll bet that
strawberry during.
3 or 4 Bucks for that little
bottle.
So but it was a lot healthier
for and she knows it
but she doesn't have the pantry stocked
with that for the kids because it cut during
10 of those a day
but but it is it's
it's it's about
balancing
acts and and how
we educate the people on how we
feed him better and help
how we can make
you more healthy.
And and another thing
is. That I've
preached to my
grandkids
because I have
3 I have 6
grandkids and
3 of them are
overweight.
And.
One thing that I preach them
is it's okay to be
hungry.
Now it's not okay to be
hungry in a way.
That we're talking about here today
because that's different.
We're we're talking about
hunger.
Health
the.
People that that feel
safe at home and feel like
they have a home that
that will provide for
them.
But whenever you're talking
about overweight I
teach the kids or try
to instill in
them is it's okay
to be hungry.
As long as you know you have a
meal you know come
supper time it's
okay you do you don't have to be
not hungry all the way
between dinner and
supper.
But and and I think that
if if we educate our kids
and that I think
in in the long
run we'll create
healthier kids.
And and they'll have you
know less knee
replacement.
And all the other issues that
go along
diabetes so you know
I've I've had to
quit back. Cut
back my sweets
can get on met foreman I was like
a 7.3 on my A. one
C. and
then I want
to kick myself in the **** because
I think I could have done
better.
But I didn't because because I
was spoiled.
I work for
I work for a guy for
a long time.
And he always said this is the
only country in the world that you can
kill yourself by
eating.
And and and you
look at it that way and then
yet we have the hunger
problem in in
the security
problem with with food you
know so
this is this something
that we can work along the way and
and tweak it and
educated.
And do better in the
future.
I will totally support the amount
of money that you're asking for I did want
to ask what about the 5000000
that we kept talking about what was
that
money.
That was the amount that
the food banks
were
were given last year
which was incredibly incredibly
helpful
and you know this upcoming
year the thought was well let's
let's talk about what the need is
that's really talk about what the need
is
and and let
you all know that the cost
of of really what the need is
and continuing on to that is
why there there was a chef to
15000000 this year
it Katie was that out of the
24000000 that was
designated because no originally
the the food group
had asked for $14000000
and was very surprised
when I went up to 24000000
and so that I was part of that
24000000 madam chair
cracked okay yes
so madam chair do understand
that they were receive
29000000 them
now Representative
it and I wanted to say madam
chair.
Be
nice.
Senator Rodriguez 21 of
and just try to
elaborate on that Mr chairman
thank you Representative
it was a 20 $4000000
initiative from the
governor and
she had pushed that throughout the
summer and continuously to
the session and
so initially
as senator in our chair
indicated it was
down to about 14000000
during the debates and discussions
but at the and it was
agreed that the
20 4000000 would go
in there into that food
initiative and part of
that was the 5000000
that got distributed to the
food. Thank
you bye it was very
very maker
considering the the
needs and
and what was the
bailable we
really need to
provide much more but I'll wait
for my turn because I'm doing all my
talking now on your.
Thank you for your you're good you're
good so so the
24000000 was was
the silo of money
and then it got distributed to different
places in the food bank up
5 minutes.
Thank thank you for
that.
I lost my train of thought but
your minds of them to support
whatever you need me to do
yes that is right
in in in the
I know where I was at
so so the next thing I was going to
touch base on madam chair and
and presenters was
the the
physical.
Food banks their
their buildings
their refrigerators or
freezers I I
go to my food bank.
Of I probably on
a more regular basis
and I should I think last time I
the Dan asked me
said the is it your
wife home.
It's looking it is a
big I was asking you so
many questions and stuff
that the I
felt like she was almost
kicking me in the **** to
get me out of there but
but it it's it's an
important thing that we need
to look at and
and as we've grown
as eastern New Mexico
there and and Clovis food
bank has grown.
They faced issues
with an older for freezer
and and they turned that
into a refrigerator and
they built a new freezers
stuff and they've always
gotten.
I'd call good support.
But the as a state I
think I think we need to look
at that and
and.
Stay in touch with them and and
upkeep and maintain their
facilities.
Where.
I believe
Diana told me 11 day
that.
That
they were offered
a truckload of something
and she said we don't have the
capacity we can't
handle that so we
had to reject it.
And.
It's it's something like that that
makes you wonder where do where should
we be on this and
and I know it's it's fine
tuning in and and we
rely on you guys
you know to bring those issues to us
and and thank you for doing your
presentation today
and look forward
to working with the and and learning
more on all this thank you madam
chair thank you Representative
more Representative Mason and
representative Allison
Senator Rodriguez you all in
line we still have more
that.
The
part.
Thank you for 11 plus the talking
but not.
We appreciate it I've always
that. As far
as government goes
was like he said we spend
so much money well
so many things that don't
matter to
me and I'm a
big proponent that we
should be strengthening our government
instead of growing to.
But the one thing I've always
thought I do not
want it's a shame
if we let anybody go hungry
on our watch.
And they were not talked with
maybe 15 minutes a lot of money
don't get me wrong.
When you figure some of the other things
that we spent
20000000 honor
the I see no
this is this should be a pro
property was
the you're talking about
some New Mexico
madam chairman Mexico
grown products going out of
state.
But that was going to ask
a what a
presentation from the rules
of school district in our school district
artesian the governor
had the.
Local grown
initiative money that
these thank god
for that do
you all.
Why should look y'all don't get
the money to buy the local
grown stuff the
different all.
What madam chair
members of the committee first
of all.
Food grown in New Mexico
more than 90 percent of the food
that is grown in New Mexico is
sent out of state
and that is because there's
no ability to process
the food in New
Mexico or even of course
having issues with
our ranchers being able to
have their meat but
shared in the state
so that is a huge gap
in is that
really is the challenge
in actually providing
more New Mexico grown food
to me do Mexicans
so that is one thing
the other is is that I
mentioned earlier this
regional farm to food bank
program it's actually at the
federal level called the local
food purchase
agreement the
cooperative
program it's very
long hence the reason we
stay we change the name to the
regional farm the food bank
program but over
3 years that's providing
about $5000000
of federal funds
and to the food banks
and we are
tasked with purchasing
food in New
Mexico this is food
that's grown in New Mexico
minimally processed in New
Mexico or it's
from our New Mexico
Rangers so
that we've spent
about a little over
$1000000 currently
so that's going
into
of the economy of our
state and what we hope
it's doing too is helping
those small more
associated advantage
farmers and ranchers
to take that money and build
their capacity so that they
can grow more and provide
more and we're
excited about this opportunity
we're getting the freshest food
we can into the
food banks and out to people who
need it so but we're
also supporting our
local economies which
is very important to us as
well did that answer
your question I want to make
sure. Really
made me think of another question
sure
I lex said Russell
schools but on the
program endorsed
by there's a meat
processor and Ross and are
you just the they're
spending nearly all of their
money find 100
percent of their May
the product from this that
lack $900000
worth of the from
from him now
we have other USDA.
Does this lack
fresh mate is it has
anything to play in your
type of program Sir
because then of the the
storage bill you don't want to send it
home with just everybody
don't want to go
but.
Get the.
Madam chair members the
committee the
rejoins owns a program
first all is part of an
the governor's New Mexico
grown initiative
and so at you
likely already know about
that farm to school
program and those other
programs that are so important
so this is a fairly new program
but one of the things that the food
banks did is they identified
protein as
something that the food banks
never have enough up
and want more of
so we've really targeted
working with local ranchers
to make sure we get more
beef bison
and other meats into the
food banks and out to people who
need it you raise a
good point so when
we're talking about the
capacity of the food banks
to take this food
that means we have to have a large
refrigerators and freezers
right but because
we work in a network of
those partner agencies
those partner agencies also
have to have the capacity
to handle this fresh food
and sometimes that's where it
breaks down a little bit
because you have a small
community with maybe a small
food pantry that
food pantry only
has access to the space
the distribute food and maybe
once a month because they
lease that space
many of them so
they don't have their own space
to store any food has to
be done in a distributed
immediately but they
also don't have cold
storage and it's
another thing you know I know
that producers
also don't have enough cold
storage so that's
the issue here in New Mexico
that's one of the challenges I
guess and providing the
healthiest food is
that people don't have the capacity
to handle it at all levels
of that distribution.
Thank you thank
it and I and
I agree I.
Really know the answer before
I ask it I guess but the
so should we be
investing
in.
Infrastructure
in supply some local
place they can
distributed weekly
to.
Places around the state or
something you know it
and also half
though and one for home of
beans in Artesia.
No coal stored for apartment
buildings good protein
source federal lots
of.
But they have to
cook.
Madam chair and members of the committee
I. Montoya
beings actually we just got a
bunch in.
We love Pinto beans when they
come into the food bank we
usually get them in 2000
pound bags and
we have volunteers to repack
them in one or 2 pound
bags to make it
easy to distribute them to
families so
we love our beans
absolutely thank you very
much for that but that is a
very important protein
item up when
we're talking about capacity it is
absolutely an issue the
infrastructure issue
is big
and I will say
that when we were talking
Senator Rodriguez mentioned
earlier the food
initiative and the funds
that were put towards that
some of that money did go
to work on infrastructure
the food banks were able to
access money from the
New Mexico food security
fund which is a part
of that state funding
this would have been. The
last fiscal year
the fiscal year that just ended June
30 so the food
banks are able to access state
funds and build their
fleets for example because
we deliver food
throughout our service area
that's another issue is that a
lot of those small pantries and
other partner agencies don't have the
ability to get to their food
bank to pick up so we
deliver to them so
there is that funding as well
and while I have the floor
I'm just going to say thank
you very very much
for the funding of
for the for the feet initiative
thank you so much we're
grateful that the state is such a
good partner in this work
yes sure it I I'm just
looking we still have 6 folks
I and I understand the enthusiasm
and I appreciate your
passion
but we still have 6 more folks
to ask questions of
your done thank you Representative
Mason all right we
have so
just as we're
coming up on the time that we're going to and
we do I know we do have some public
comment
so if we can just
both to committee and to
respondents
keep your question straight to the point
in your ancestry to the point if you will
Representative Allison you're next and
then followed by Senator Rodriguez
and then Senator Thoman
and then we've got the the
remainder of the 3.
Thank you madam
chair.
I strongly support food
banks if I
could in San Juan County
I have given school my junior
money to the echo food bank
there because I know the
help my local people
of immediately
after your presentation
started I got an
email in the mail
from it's
called native American
food security and
it's tied in with the
Roadrunner food bank
in McKinley county
and it was
I saw there was a 19
page document
and I just scanned through it
and there was a title
called the food
discrimination so
I wanted to see what that
talked about so I looked at
that and it's set
that under food
discrimination
not all the focus groups
experience but
the most common common with
a a review
this was fast
food and
highly processed foods
are being more
available and
more affordable
than fresh foods
near tribes and
pueblos
so and
then also there was another point
where it seems
like the vegetables and the
fruits that they're getting
are something that's rejected
by the grocery stores
so those 2 complaints
just caught my eye how
is the New Mexico
association of food banks going
to address that or how
are they.
6.
Madam chairman and committee
members
you're absolutely correct
that one of the big challenges that we've
absolutely seen
is the
availability of highly processed
food and the lack
of availability of
healthy fresh items
one of the things that are
Roadrunner has been working on is something
called a healthy foods
express where we
bring in essence an
outdoor market
that is primarily
fresh fruits and vegetables
as well as other
good healthy items
and we've been working I think we're working
now with
6 different
indigenous communities to
bring those items and so
that they are easier to
access with the ultimate
goal of working with
communities to
potentially start up some kind
of of local of the food
pantry within that community that's
easily accessible
because you're actually right it's
healthy food is not always easy
to get a hold of
in terms of the fruits
and vegetables sometimes
the fruits and vegetables we receive for
retail rescue so that
donated product
is end of
life produce and may not
be the prettiest some of
it is
you know funny looking school
should we're looking carrots and things
like that so those things are
sometimes available to
distributions across the state
we try really hard to work with the
partners that receive that product
and let them know where it's coming from
and why it might not be the prettiest
thing to look at
but that's kind of part
of of the food that
we have available to us to
find.
Thank you Sir.
Yes madam chair thank
you thank you Representative
Senator Rodriguez and senator
Clemente and
we'll continue on the rest of the stuff
that thank you madam chairman
I'll be as brief as possible
here think it's good to see you share
in the 7 nice lady
thank you for your work I'm so happy
that you're painting even a small
picture of the work the
immense workload
that you have and how much you do
how you do it without the
resources I don't
know but somehow you're
getting that done and
working extremely hard
thank you so much for
requesting an continuing your
tenacity in
requesting funding to
help the poor and
I remember last year madam
chairman sure you
requested 15000000
also last year didn't
you and so
I'm wondering
you're requesting 15000000 for
this coming year also
considering that
the cost of gone up so
much the needs have gone
up so much and
there's more and more poverty as
we now
you requested 15 then you
got I I'm
wondering
you obviously need more than
15 and and
perhaps we can talk about that
to see if maybe
somehow we can blended
in there for if you get less
than the 15 it'll
be more than 5 that you got
last year so let's
see what we can do there but
you're also requesting getting
recurring money which is
I see on your request here on
the sheet and madam chairman
it's as recurring funding
and it should be recurring because
what's happening is that were
appropriating funds madam
chairman and a lot of these funds
we know people are not hungry
just for a year or a day at a
time it's a continuous
thing and we appropriate
nonrecurring money in
some cases it doesn't
work so we need to do
that but just quickly but
for the sake of time because I know
others are on the list to
but this is a food
bank the
food bank situation years
your to be banking food
you shouldn't be expected to
have to use 40
percent of your
funds to buy
food. As if
you were a that a shopper
instead you're playing the
opposite because you're supposed to be
banking at and and we're not
allowing you to do that if we don't provide
the resources to
do that so
that's not good that you're having to use
$5000000 of your own funds
is what I heard you say
earlier
and madam chairman
I just a final
question here and I'm gonna stop
because I can meet with sherry
were you one are going to be for the
end of the year anyway so hopefully
we can still do that
but I just a quick question
kitchen angels you mentioned
about your partner's a great
partners that you have and I'm so
happy for that but we
have kitchen angels are the one of
your partners this they
you talked about preparing meals
special meals and and
they're wonderful too so
I'm happy that you you
work with them also
and I sponsor
legislation every year for them
but I didn't realize they were
connected with the food
banks yeah thank you
madam chairman and I don't know
sherry has any quick response
to anything I said if not I'm good
we can talk later
okay thank you thank you
Senator Rodriguez Senator
Tallman and
then
Representative on you nor
new vice chair Gallegos
and Representative little
she comes back in
time.
Okay my
apologies.
So
Senator Tallman you're next.
Thank you Mr chairman
madam chair.
Are you said madam Mr
chair.
It's late.
I hear you I hear
you I'll give you that slide
it is we'll go
ahead.
It's it's.
Responses.
So.
We're wasting time here this move
on so
thank you panel for being
here so.
Zoom zoom normalized
to question about.
How accurate is the information
who does the
survey
yeah I start out.
14 years ago the volunteer
for Roadrunner Food Bank adventure
the guy on the
board served one
term.
And.
I participated F.
of.
Is a volunteer
we're it
was.
By FE to feeding
America we actually
we interviewed people
and SO
IT tells questions
about.
The food this is so
is that something it's still
done and is that more
accurate than the figure
just
K..
Madam chair and committee members that's a
great question Senator
Tallman
what has it shifted now
feeding America no longer does
that huge
nationwide survey which is called
the hunger in America
a study and they would do
it every 4 years I
believe what we're
doing now
and and Roadrunner is
working on something that's called
a link to feed system that
allows us to get a
real time information about
food distributions that are happening
so we understand what
they need is we understand where people
are coming from
and get a real sense of you know
maybe we need to look for
pantry this particular community
because everybody from this community
is coming to this other community
and we're also implementing
I'm in bits and pieces something called the
feeding America client survey
which is a lot like
the hunger in America
study so we're
really combining a lot of
different data sources
to get the answers that we
need the census
bureau information is
is pretty good although
what we have found across the board
is that typically hunger and
food insecurity is under
reported people don't
like to talk about it
so our guest Imation as
those numbers are probably higher in a
lot of those places but we
are getting that wonderful data
back from link to feed as well
as the feeding America
client survey
and really building out a system
that's going to allow us to be even
more I data
informed and the
decisions that are being
made.
So madam chair
and.
Mr
Anderson.
To no room
think of Representative
Zamora feel comfortable
you feel these.
The statistics that you quarter
pretty accurate.
Madam chair and committee members I do
believe they're accurate
and in fact I believe that they are
likely a little bit
lower than what the reality
is but
they're certainly not
at it is not over
Representative I don't
believe that those
numbers are higher than what is actually
happening in those
communities okay thank you
and.
Madam also played a Senator
personal except us
short answers
so on chart
7.
The the blue.
Is purchased
food.
Madam chair and committee members the
blue on the
bigger circle
is the food that was purchased
with the funding from
the state
last 4 figure
yes it is.
That's amazing because I can
remember that along those only like
one percent.
Would you guys reasons
as.
And then.
In Santa Fe food bank it's
40 percent.
It's amazing process
same page page to
strict
well.
This is some seniors are gone
from 291 to 20
6001.
At some Representative
is that half 25
percent it's
seniors so that is the
single that is a single
senior we
have to pull that
information directly from I just
need to get that and get the actual
numbers of how many seniors that
affects but that is the
minimum allotments
$26 per month
is the minimum allotment
for a senior
that qualifies for
for snap the senior
with no incomers as
sliding scale it's
a sliding scale
it so the the the
richest poor person
would get
$29
correct which is not a
lot of food now.
If I if I may
I know I should talk right because
I can't stop.
Just a very nice
time.
Senator Tallman
honestly
the snap benefits that go
to seniors is appallingly
low is
horrifyingly low
and there was a time where the state
legislature actually
looked at supplementing
the federal snap benefits
for seniors
and I would encourage you all to
consider that again
I believe that when that
happened the state
legislature
supplemented it maybe
$25 per
senior who qualified
each month but that
is still so
helpful to them
thank you Madam that's a point
just trying to make is
appalling appallingly
low of page
3.
515
what's the
read.
Are you looking at that
sorry chair looking at that
slide 15 I think
it was red
yes.
The red color is
the food that came in through the
Corona virus food
box program
so really only ran for
about about a year
point 5 and then it
was and then it ended
and I believe it was may of
2021
perhaps so
it was that we
treated a lot like like
T. FAP commodities USDA
commodities
we handled it the same way
but that basically
that pipeline of food was shut
off and
not available any longer
the 2 following.
Years 21
and
20.
To be dropped.
Substantially the drop
because. There
was less money of
the.
For the drop because of us
need are both.
It dropped because of less
money that was that was
sent through from the federal
side this is our
all federal federally
funded foods so madam
chair.
And this is
a.
Anderson yes
the.
There's a lot of one that need
to.
That is correct.
If
so.
For.
Thanks thanks to
now is that a.
My first board meeting yesterday
the meals on wheels.
They have And Santa
Fe.
And I was really impressed
with how but a sophisticated
operations you know it they've
gone statewide
that used to be just
Albuquerque now they're actually
having Roadrunner
food bank is actually
shipping meals.
From that are prepared by news
of those Albuquerque to Los
crucis.
So if you if you look miss
Harper.
Hooper
copper thank
you sister.
If you look are you aware
that have you looked into parting with
the meals on wheels in Albuquerque
he talked about doing milk
No providing meals
madam chair members of the committee
yes senator Tom and we have
we've had several meetings with meals
on wheels and they
do have funding that would
allow them to send
meals for that
on the food bank drugs
into rural communities
mostly for seniors of course
so yes that's not something we've been
able to do yet but we are
in it's in
motion.
With the daily miss Hooper
I met in 2008
when I was a deputy
city manager in Santa Fe
New.
She contacted me
about.
Purchasing or leasing
additional land from the
city. So
are you still in the same
location.
Yes we are thank
you you expanded all
because of you thank
you very much
Senator.
Yes we have expanded thank
you yes
so
C.
H..
Slide 33
page
6.
People worry talk about the
50000000.
So is
that all 50000000
that we.
Is item the amount you
feel you can
get.
But you need more
what would be the ideal
if you could just have.
If you feel you need more how much
more in the you
met madam
chair and and committee members
we were looking at
that the lovely dad
around the missing meals
and determined that if we
wanted to you
know shoot for the moon
and attempt to
really meet the mail
gap for our entire state
the cost for that would be somewhere in the
neighborhood of
$22000000.
22 yes
Sir.
Okay.
I guess so I
have yes
more than my share questions
except. I just
one of the following
comment remember
where I was.
Thank you for the food bank of a
lot of people used to think that
most of our food was donated
you know we had the leather
letter to postal
post office you know that
thing every January
people drop off food
and. The
food bank a drop of food
at various
commercial locations in
schools.
Percent only amounted
to
what 2
percent.
Federal in single
digits.
When in fact this is
very small so people have no
idea.
Unfortunately the really
misinformed about what the need
is and where the food comes
from thank you
Mr Mr
chair.
Sorry.
Thank you for being
here. Representative
Zamora madam chair
are are the numbers that we're
getting for
the Senate program and stuff is that
on the the about the
new farm bill that just came out
or is that
past.
Madam chair and members of the
committee the farm bill is still being
negotiated and
with the.
With the potential government shutdown
again in November and
November it is unlikely
that the farm bill will be in
place by the end of
this calendar
year that's what we're
hearing the food
banks continue to meet with our
congressional delegation
to talk to them about the
importance of snap
benefits
and the importance of the teeth
that program which is the
USDA commodities program
that we discussed
so we continue to
work with them to see that
that that farm bill is
strong and
is
we don't see funding
cuts to those very important
programs that help people in
need thank you
madam chair thank you thank you
Representative on your new
and then vice chair guy
goes and then Representative
little.
Thank you madam chair and thank you both for
being here today
fortunately
all the questions were asked but I would
be remiss if I didn't get a
chance to a state a
little bit of something
so the district I
represent is house
district 19 and
Bernalillo county which is
the international
district
the so as I see you
nodding your heads you're probably
very familiar with it
it's it geographically very
small district
but
majority of my constituents
live at or below the poverty
line they are
an aging population as
well and we
have significant
transportation challenges on top
of everything else
earlier this year.
We face the closure
of the Walmart
that ran right along to
bus routes and
then earlier late
end of last week it was just
announced that the Walgreens
that was directly across the street from
the Walmart one at a grocery store
but it did have
to foods
aisles of also
announced its closure
and so
now.
That poses just
such a huge
challenge
for the people of my district
that in best case scenario
you take 2 buses and you're
still a half mile walk
from of the
table
there's a sprouts and there
is the whole paycheck I'm sorry the whole
foods
and
so I just want to highlight
I want to thank you so much for the work that
you do my
constituents are particularly
dependent on its and
now you've got
hundreds more families
that are in need of your services as
well so
I look forward to working with
you. Going
forward as we try to
get a grocery store of some
sort back into the area hopefully
something that's more community
based because
these large corporations are
closing out all our locally
owned stores and then and then
bouncing out and leaving us quite
literally hungry and high and
dry so thank
you for the work it's
not a shrinking problem in our state
unfortunately but I I'd like
to just.
Work to see that
trend start going down so
thank you very much.
Thank you Representative vice chair Gallegos
and then we'll finish off with Representative
little and
thank you madam chair and
thank you to our
presenters
you know I think that
we have to keep in mind that during the
COVID of the
food banks came through not only
for New Mexico communities
but for communities across
the country
I remember watching
television and is seen
people lined up for
miles and
making sure that it
was the food banks that took
care of.
Of all of this during that time
and so
wanted to is just to say thank
you again for that
in my
particular
what I do on as my as my
day job
is we provide
services for kids
in foster care and what
we also saw is during
the pandemic that
kids are aging out of the
system.
Agencies were closed down
they didn't know where to go
to and
once again food banks stepped
up we've got numerous
food boxes
and got them set
up on a regular
basis because
if not I don't think they would have
survived that time
so thank you personally
for all that
I am on your
asked for
15000000.
Does that include
the cold
storage that you're needing does
that include get that's what I need
that didn't think so.
Right so the if it's all
food you're still running in
the deficit and I
think it's important
that we stress that to
this to this
committed to this
committee and when
you're sitting before
appropriations and finance
committee to really stress that
because
that's a big price tag
but I think that
legislators and
appropriators need to understand
what it's for and what
your need is and so be
real clear and
just ask for right now
there's the money and
so we need to make sure
to to give
back to you also you can
keep helping our communities
and so with that
I that's all I have got
today thank you Mr
Representative
little.
Thank you very much.
Madam chair
my question is
whether was on the
poverty guidelines as I
was looking through the slides and
I noticed also
how they were the
the qualifying.
At percentage of
income was so
varied as you pointed
out
I know that that I'm aware that there's
a federal line
is the are the poverty
guidelines
dependent on the community
is that why they're so
different for
my question is I was just
wondering whether
these guidelines or those
percentages could be standardized
that's a that's a really
challenging way
for I remember being a single
mom with a little girl
to have to.
Navigate I can
do this here but I can't qualify
here or we can do this
year but we can't do this
there so I
think at the I
think that
parents care
givers are having to
piecemeal what they
can do to
create a full
grocery basket for their
families so I'm just
I'm wondering if that's possible
and what
might the incentive
of that's gonna be my second question
but that's my
first thank
you.
Madam chair and committee
members some of
those are
we can decide in New
Mexico.
So for for
instance snap
there's a certain amount that comes
from the fed's for that
but states can go all the way up
to 200 percent of the federal
poverty line they can choose to do
that I
I'm not sure on which to be very
honest with you some
of those I'd have to look into a little bit more
to be happy to to provide
feedback on that
afterwards but T.
fab is also one that is
determined by the USDA
commodities that percentage is also
determined within the
state
in total agreement with
you if there's a way that our
state could standardize some of that
information little more
it would be a lot easier
for for community
members who need that help to
navigate
to navigate that because it is very
challenging right now particularly
for seniors I
think many who
struggle with technology
and they don't you have to run
from office to
office and that really is what what
happens.
Thank you very much
I I
am thinking of this
just thinking back to being a
very young mom
up with a daughter
and I remember
finally having
we've finally worked up the nerve
to go apply for
assistance because we
just didn't want to I was
going to we're going to figure out
how to do this family
would help out and so on but
when we finally did it
was at the time in
the eighties I think we qualified
for like $26
a month and I remember feeling
so dejected
but as my
mom would and my
parents were telling
me they were firm
believers in assistance
because as they told me
we are taxpayers we are
going to be paying taxes for the
rest of our lives and if
we need this kind of support
for a period of time
then we ought to be able to
access it and take
it buyer meet.
We'll take care of the rest
the the okay so that's
a little story was for me
but I'm
curious with that
the the the
amount of food that
is donated it got me to
thinking I was wondering
where the partnerships
over the donations are
with like companies
like Walmart
the big businesses are
they are they
partners with food
banks
I've not been in this area
so I might be asking a question
that you're that everybody's well
aware of but I'm curious
and and then
if they're not so
much
what could we do
to incentivize
their ability
there
opportunity
to to make
contributions like this
and what we want to address
that thank you madam
chair.
Madam chair and committee members
we the
relationships with I can
speak to Walmart in
particular
we have a great
relationship with
the the distribution
center its down in Los
Lunas Roadrunner does and they
do a put aside a good
amount of product force particularly
fresh fruits and vegetables which is
really really helpful
other than that it's
really a store by store
basis and
it it is a lot more
dependent I think upon
something as simple as a store
manager wanting
to work with you or
somebody who's working in the back on
the dock wanting to work with
you that it is
at the corporate
level the
corporate level is very supportive
of it but you have
to you have to make
friends with the local
staff and in
some places it works well in some
places it
doesn't.
So just that quick follow up would
be what can what
might be done
and we don't have to answer it today
but what might be possible
to
incentivize.
Setting aside those
the food for
the contributions if you
well and putting that in their
quote those type of
donations to be
made.
It is a question it's it's
I think it's really supporting our
local our local farmers
to like up with
them because they can
provide the food
and they want to provide the
food.
I don't know if
I'm.
I think local like like let's
keep our money owners so and we
know darn well
that bigger corporations
that money doesn't stay
here.
Madam chairman and committee
members there are
there are some really wonderful moves
that legislatures across
the country have done
to help incentivize
particularly
local farmers
ranchers and
tax benefits and other things
so I there are possibilities
I think for our
state.
When you wanted to do a quick
a quick
yes madam chair I'm not
as long winded as senator Tom
is.
Madam chair in presenters
I just want to give a big shout
out you know we know there's
people listening out there
to the private donors
also. The
private donors step
up it and and they give
money and and
just like their May about
it and they don't want any kind of
recognition everything
and they're big supporter of our
food banks and thank you for
that.

benefits of paid leave are well
documented yet most people
do not have access to
this basic
protection
when serious personal

inevitably arise
people face impossible
choices
between their families well

security and their
jobs women
of color are specially
harmed by the lack of paid
leave in

Even though they're often the key
breadwinners in their
families the
disparities are stark it

leave is also essential support
