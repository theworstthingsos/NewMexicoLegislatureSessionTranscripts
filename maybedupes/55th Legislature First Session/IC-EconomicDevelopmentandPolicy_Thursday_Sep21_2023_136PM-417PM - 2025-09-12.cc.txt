All right we're back from
lunch recess it is
136 we are here
on the campus of western New Mexico
university this is the economic and
rural development Policy
Committee and I am the chair senator
Kerry Hammon from district 30
8:00 am I vice chair
is representative during the
eagles were Representative team
from the southwest
supplement from the southern part of the
state we
like to include them in Silvercity
as part of that recognizing
that we all are connected in
various ways and try to help
each other out so
we do have president shepherd here
from western New Mexico university
to say a few words to
present thank you very much for hosting us
you've done a great job your staff here
at the library I have
been incredibly helpful
and we're very
grateful for them so
all of you here at the library thank
you very much.
You madam chair thank you
so much for for choosing
this location of course
vice chair guy a ghost
always good to see you she and
I have worked together she
has championed early childhood
which is one of our premier
centers we have the center of early childhood
and if it wasn't for you we
would not be where we're at so I have
a heartfelt thanks to
you course
to your colleagues here
many of you I I know and I've
gotten to know here this morning
thank you for coming to our humble
abode in just real
quickly it's just a quick welcome
because I know you have a full agenda I watched
a little bit this morning but
you know you have economic in rural
development and that's important
to us we are
we are a comprehensive
university in fact
we just started the state's
only masters
of science in nursing in
in rural health and
so we're very proud of that
we recognize telehealth is one of
the one of the 4 fronts of
technology and what's gonna
be happening and and we are
training our nursing
professionals in that regard
and madam chair if you'll indulge me
just for the next half hour
I'm kidding for the next couple
of minutes let
me tell you just a little bit about our
little university
we are you
know we're university that's on the
move our enrollment is up by
6 percent but what's more
important is our freshman class
is up by 35
percent and what that will
do is translate into the future
years obviously is they become
sophomores juniors and seniors
we're so for that we're gonna have to
build more housing on campus and
literally double the population on
campus throughout our
area we're having
a housing shortage
if you will for faculty staff who
are looking at building apartments
on campus we're looking at building a
hotel on campus a whole bunch of
exciting things why
do I share that with you in
part because I want to brag
but the other part is because
of the work that you do and
it's called it's the economic
development piece
in order to do that you need a
couple of things you need well trained
workforce with the only
university in the state
that goes from
the the certificate
associate degree bachelor's
degree to the masses to read more than
goes up to the bachelor's degree
we do that whole
game.
those particular replicate
Representative recommendations it was
actually across all
of the participants and
so what you see in
4.one is very
similar to what personal was
talking about how can we
make sure that that there's
technical assistance and public
awareness not just in our
in our public the
population centers
not just based on our research
institutions that I mostly
work with but how can we get out
to places like
Kwesta and quest
is an extraordinary
place
because they are
piloting some of the most
technological at
technologically advanced grid
technologies and
working with cricket Carson called
up but that is just
one example in New Mexico
and I don't want.
Only people like those
who are Los Alamos who
is also doing a lot of
advance things not no
surprise but we really need
to think about how do we get that out
to our rural communities across
our state not just in
in little tiny pockets
so the first one is really
about how can we get
those resources around
technical assistance as well
as public education and
awareness and that's something
I like to tell people the
cleanest energy that's
out there is the energy that we don't
use that's the energy
efficiency and it's
so important for us to
be educating people
around efficiency
and so I think there's a lot of
opportunities in the
K. 12 space for that in
higher ed and then of
course of course across
the public as well.
And then the the final
recommendation actually
has a very specific
ask which is for
paid professional development
for teachers to actually
learn these things
so often the professional development
we ask of our teachers our science
teachers are things that they do on their
own they do on their own
time they're not paid for that
and on the recommendation
is very clearly
about providing rate
opportunities for teachers to be
involved with all of that
so I think with that we are
happy to stand for questions thank
you.
Well you're one of the most efficient
presentations we've seen on this
committee so and
I appreciate that and I
do have to say I would like to ask
if we can have your permission to use
this as an example
because one of the things that
we all ask is legislators
is what do you need us to
do.
Ultimately because you know there's
some of us that are wanting more
information and then there are
others who are like we get what you're doing
we need to know what we can do so
I really appreciate
these recommendations and if
I can have permission to use this as
an example for
future committees I would
love that.
That that's yes madam chair I
absolutely thank you very
much just
because I don't think it's any could be any
clearer more I committee
so
I I do we do have
Representative Lujan I don't know if
anybody else wants to ask any questions
I have one question for
Priscilla.
Representative Duncan
okay if I
may I refer you
minds just a real
straightforward question to
Priscilla
my fellow women of
distinction.
And so you know you mentioned
about training from
the environmental Department in rural
communities and representative Duncan
and I were talking about
this
is you know as we
continue to have conversations
about trying to diversify
our revenue stream and
diversify
our job force
you know we have people who work in
the oil and gas industry who
absolutely have every
right to be concerned
when we talk about moving away
from
from fossil fuels
to moving towards more
renewable energy in my
my statement has always been
that if we're going to do that we
have to find jobs
that pay either equal or
more than what they're getting already
because they're worried about putting
food on their table there worried
about keeping the roof over their heads
so I appreciate
that and and can you tell me more
about the training to you know
more personal about the training
that the environmental Department would
be providing because I think for
specially those rural communities
where we have a lot of those power
plants.
That that's really critical
for those areas
so sure madam chair and
members of the committee
so what I
can tell you the New Mexico
environment department is in the
process of developing
an application
to the fat federal
government for actually
applying for a
1.$5000000
for a training
programs
to be able to
find specifically
some some of the training programs
they've been talking about is
for plumbers for H.
back technicians
and also includes
Energy auditors
and home performance
contractors are some
of the and the electricians
are some of the main
occupations that
they're trying to focus on
and we realize that
1.$5000000
isn't a lot of money for the
amount of needs
but I think that it's a start
right and I think what I like
about that is that
that they as a state agency
see what's coming down
and that we need to have
we need to be better prepared
right we are ready seen
those challenges within our
own jurisdictions
about not
having enough
electricians not having
enough H. back and so when
you need something done immediately
we know that the weight is quite
a weight right and so
how do we do that so that we also
foster some of the small businesses
because the ones that have been
the business for years
they're ready to retire and move
on and we need to mentor and
foster some of these new businesses
to come up within the all rural
communities and to do
that so those are part of the
discussions
there is discussions around
utilizing
the community colleges to
be able to bring that
training we know that
Santa Fe college has
a very specific training around
weather's ation and
being able to pull out
just having the energy
auditor
certification so
that we can do that at least at
a minimum and so
those are all the discussions I
believe the application isn't
due until January
they had initially said. Of an
October deadline but now
they've moved it to January
so we
and partnership
with this group and as well
as the
card directors are supporting
that effort so that we
can bring those training opportunities
to our local areas
thank you for so I think you know
we look at this this is you
know we still see that there are areas that
are not being addressed right I mean
you know the return on investment for the
jobs that you talked about
is at this moment
much higher than
somebody going to a 46
year college
they both are needed but we
also recognize that there are folks
who are going to excel in these
positions of H. back and
plumbing and electrical
in ways that they wouldn't and other
other traditional
areas of of training
but I think also some of
the things that move that we're talking
about recognizing the importance
of having these
is also maybe using that as
a model
for training in these kind
of specialty fields we're talking about
energy efficiency
and renewable energy.
Because that's the only way that we're really going
to create this industry I mean
given that our state experiences
350 days of sunshine
a year well in the southern part we
do sorry but for those units
part
of.
But that we have those opportunities
why are we not capitalizing
on that industry
and and I you know and
and a shot up to doing in a community
college as well Dr Monica
Torrez is is also really good
about those this position
so I think that's just something
for us to kind of marinade on as a
committee is
like looking at these kinds of
programs to see
how we can really expand this
into areas that we know especially
our rural communities
that our rural communities would benefit
from and also
make
make the transition
eventually as we're looking at a long term
plan make that
transition a lot more comfortable
for families knowing that they're going to be
able to provide for their families
and put food on their tables
in a way that is going to be long
term sustaining
so I I appreciate that and
I I hope we can kind of merit
on that the other thing I would recommend
is that if there are letters of support
that you need from the
legislature.
That if you get
experience interest from
this committee that you
follow up with that so that
we can write letters of support
absolutely so I'm I'm offering
that right now as the
chair and I think that
would be helpful if there are other members
of this committee that want to do
that so madam chair
members of the committee thank you
very much for that offer and
I will reach out back to the
New Mexico environment department
and the person working on this
application because
we we know that it's
important and then
I often think about the
conversations that I have with
representative Armstrong
about what
the challenges she faces
within within her own
business and
and I think about
other things and how it correlates
for example
are silver consolidated schools
was one of the recipients of
the innovation zone
where they're actually taking
and implementing some
of those types
of trains within
the high school
because I believe if we don't
start them early they
don't really know what they're opportunities
are available to them
and and what I always talk about
is is my experience
support and growing up in a
rural area I
didn't know what was was available
to me right
Senator Hemphill and
I we had a conversation this morning
about where they asked
her what she wanted to be when she grew up
it's just that the typist
and my response was no different
I didn't want to be any more or any
less that's all I wanted to
be right and that's
because that's all we knew what was in
front of us right
because we don't even
know that that would there's a much
bigger role that exist
out there and what we what
we find is that we have
so many
children who are
so educated
and thrive to
do better for themselves
and I think that's something
we all want to
encourage.
Through our lives and mentor
individuals to be able
to have those opportunities
that for themselves
so thank you madam chair
thank you thank you
absolutely
we've got Representative Lujan and
then representative Duncan anybody
else would like to get on that
list okay Senator
Griggs Representative
Lujan go ahead thank you
madam chair thank you for this
presentation
so many things are going on in my
my mind was
with a focus that I have the policy that
I'm working on and and that is on
an energy renewables
and so I think
there's a a
bigger opportunity here that we
need to talk about how we're going to
bring this knowledge
this training this
information to
everybody
because the
we have a grid
modernization act already in
place and so some
of the things that you're talking about some of
the recommendations that you
are you brought
for today are being
addressed in other ways
and I think there there needs to be
a clear path of
information and planning
so when I'm thinking about
our transition needs as
we're transitioning
into renewables are
cleaner energy
as the number one
affordability
reliability and and the
way that we're going to
do that through clean
green resources and I think that's what
you're getting at here
and some of the ideas I
think are not being
fully
that'd in a way that
we need them to be
and I think this is what you are
doing is that what you have created
the opportunity for us to move
forward with that type of
information and
gathering and
and continuing that it that
information because through
the. You know
what is happening now for the planning
and some legislation myself and
and Representative
Dixon and senator Sir
phonics and others have been working
on. Is
to get that planning
in place
and to identify
what exactly those energy
needs are and how
we are transitioning to
the ETA yeah
PNM already has
put a plan forward
we are in transition with the
PRC and you
PRC.
And today even today right
now as we're talking they're talking
about the
regional transition
operations in art and getting
education in moving forward with that
sort of
thing.
The way that we get affordability
in my my
perfume madam chair one of the
things I think we're missing here out at
on this panel right now the education
piece there is to
do I to understand
this in a in a bigger scope
in a bigger way bigger
way and that
means us come together and
looking at what original
transition operation
would would do and that means
us.
Working with the federal government which you've
identified that means
us working with western
states so that we can
come together and putting all
those things on in a new
modernize grid
system.
And without that I don't
see that this transition
really works
comes to fruition with
that affordability.
And so these are bigger conversations
and I think that we're not having that
conversation today and
I'm I'm sorry
about that because that's one piece I
love what you did you
absolutely went out there
and did the groundwork that is
necessary and just getting
this information of what
is what the ETA
when what the needs are of our
communities and especially in our
rural areas
but again like if we what
we did with broadband is
we came in a bit too
late. I
I think and so we have all these
gaps. We're
still working on them and we're coming
a long way with that right
now as you mentioned we have the
resources as far as the federal
money with the IRA
and with.
Other other funding resources
what we need to do
is is
focused on
what that means where
we are with that because what
PNM is done also to
their you know to.
With the grid modernization
act is to bring for the
smart metering and doing all those
sort of things so that we know
what those needs are
so I commend you
immensely on on all
this work and effort for so
you know.
You bring forward just
the the.
All the things
that we
need to prepare for this
in our workforce and
without that that
infrastructure piece and
the equity piece that goes along with
that we're not gonna be able to
make to get to that
bigger picture and I just
want to just you know this is
this is very concerning to
me because this is
where we we need to be
moving towards
and I just in
a I'm very appreciative
that we're having this conversation here
today at this level because
this means it.
We're we're expanding
we're growing and I'd love
to talk more with you offline but I
really think I I have to put that
forward like there
is you're giving us a branch
of information but there's this other
this other portion of it
that's not really being discussed
today so
I appreciate you I thank
you I look forward to working
with you.
With every and and see how
we we really
very all that information
and grow that these
connections of information together
thank you miss madam chair appreciate the
tons more of a COVID
but if you have anything to add to that
I would appreciate any
response thank you.
Madam chair representative will hunt
thank you so much for those comments
and I just want to reiterate
we're really reporting on what
citizens said was important to
us so it's a grassroots
peace but what you're
bringing up absolutely is
important and we and
we were definitely interested
in representing those voices
and then I on the other side
as the director of our research
project we we
have some resources
and some knowledge around the
grid that would be helpful to
contribute as well so we
will love to follow up with you
we do have a longer report
coming out next week and so you'll
you'll see more about that sort of
the. The
the the actual voices
of the people
for their but at
absolutely we would we
would welcome that continued
engagement thank you for your leadership
thank you madam
chair.
Thank you so much and I appreciate the
conversation and and the information
that you have if you don't mind sending
that to Erin because
then she can send it to the rest of the
committee and even the report
that you have them in the information
that we've talked about now
but also when the report comes
out to send that
as well I think would be really helpful
for the committee and I'm grateful
for for the work that you're doing on
that I have a
representative Duncan and then Senator
Griggs.
Thank you madam chair
I'm from coal country
you're never going to get any luck
Tricity cheaper than
coal. We have
some of the cleanest power plants in
the world in this
state.
Having said that I
uh feel that it
is going to be painfully
expensive for those who can
least afford it as we
go through this
and.
He will be a different group of people
sitting in front of us
asking for
money to help pay their electric
bills.
And.
So one of the
one other concern I have as
I look at this
is you know some of us
have stem
or technical schools
high schools in our
districts
and
the sometimes I look at things
I wonder for as
as we get request some
we're given money here were
given money here were given money here
and and often
times
at all this call is an
example as an old county
commissioner it
always frustrated me to give
money to call in and have you give that
money back to us and we got a federal
grant I I never
could understand why we had a middle
man in that group and
and the Representative
Lundstrom and are good friends
and so so
I I fear that
we're going to be giving money in 2 or
3 different locations
when in reality if we give
it to our school districts or
those technical schools
that will do the same thing
so just a thought
thank you
Sir.
Thank you. If so
grateful for Aaron because she's just like
us just to do it's like she's my
work wife now
because all she has to do is just point
and I know what she needs me to do
so I don't mean to put you on this but
like that you just turned red I'm
sorry my wife would
approve.
And so then we have a Senator
Griggs.
Thank you madam chair and you know
thank you guys for
for this I guess want to
walk through some of your recommendations
have you clear some
stuff up for me I
guess
maybe start with
11
which we manage the the
legislature to fund a
statewide working group
to write legislation
to incorporate
equity.
Within utility rate
design for all
energy utilities including
co
op.
What are you what are
you looking for
there in trying
to
to.
And then if I even I mean
what what's equitable
in which inequitable
and that could
you could you can expand
on that a little
bit.
That one 's
mind.
Thank
you.
Chair and vice
chair and
thank you Griggs.
Senator Griggs for that
we have exactly the same
question in another committee
that was prior to this
one
yes equity
is.
Sometimes difficult
to analyze
and that's why you need
data. In
order you need information to
really understand what
it means and what it means
to. A
particular community
a neighborhood house
hold you for
you can break it down.
That
way.
This was a journey for
us to
ask that question of
every person that attended
what does equity mean to
you.
Energy equity is
it affordability
is it access
to energy and it was
really all of the
above
because there are many ways
to evaluate
equity and
that's what the working group would
be about like
how do we define
it and how does
it you know does does
the particular rate
design
for that
area for whether it's a
coop for a
utility.
Is it is it equitable
for everyone
in that area
so it's it's different
for different parts of the state
because of.
For many different reasons
our temperatures are
very different we have a
whole range of
temperatures.
We have a whole range of people
living in mobile homes
we have people without
energy at all
we have people
living in apartments and
that seems to be growing
so it's not
equal.
And then we have communities
wanting to do local
choice Energy.
And when you look at it
from that perspective
they need a whole
other set of data to
understand
equity.
So we come before you
today to not
give you the definition of
equity but for
to just give you a lands
of what it might mean
for these
different areas of
need.
So
I.
And I I I think
I kind of appreciate that
I mean I understand the challenge
with it in and madam
chair and you are what you've done
those you're asking
the legislature to write
legislation
and when you're talking
about writing legislation
to incorporate equity
or feelings
anything you're gonna have
to be somewhere in
their specific
the cares you know when
you talk about it's different in
different parts of the state
how does the legislature described
that or what is
that and
you know we're we're writing
hello all and
we're we're trying to
develop whatever that
whatever that is.
If this ever moves you
know real forward
we're still gonna be have and
charged with
writing a law
that has to be
specific.
Show.
Thank you for that let's let's
move on just a little bit
let's go to let's go to
2.one on Hoosiers
at
one.
But with that energy
sovereignty and self
determination with
that you're yes I
I did present
the voices yes
let me ask you about it that
have talk about
to create a task
force that
includes you know all of
these people
establish communication
channels relationships and
trust to advance
sovereign
renewable energy developed
through partnerships
and collaboration when
we when we talk about what
we were we us
there with the solver and
there's at so this
representation tribes
this represents tribes
and pueblos in
nations
and they have a
need to want
to for more
partnerships and
collaborations
with.
Of with
agencies
but not just with agencies
they want to form
these collaborations
with you know independent
organizations that
are developing
renewable energy
so there are there seems to
be
certain not enough
dots connecting
not enough.
Just not enough collaboration
happening to actually.
Create independent
projects that
allow
tribe's sovereign
energy.
Can and madam chair in
New York my dad rewrite
that because I
don't know I don't know that that's
what it do you want
it needs to be different I
think you're what you're
trying to get
at. I'm
not sure you get at
them so I I'd look
at that she more she how I might
could could reward
that then in
them. In
2.2.
We talk about direct
state federal and
private foundations have
have you ever figured out how hard
it is might be too direct a
private foundation or to
direct the state
government I mean we
can't. We
can ask us to do anything
hardly but rectus is little
even tougher in that
show I would
I'd reconsider
have you as you've
written that
particular.
And this is certainly
about
a capacity
building.
Of yet the
2.2.to
2.2 and
and it's more the
you know direct
and I don't know I don't know that
you that this group
come from an area where it
can direct us to
do
anything.
Or any any inter
governmental agency
I'm I might
ask a representative
Allison to
perhaps help.
Explain
how do you how do
you.
Receive these
22.1
in 2.2.
Are they clear to
you.
As to what's being
asked.
Madam chair.
Of the way I read
2.one is to create
a task force
or you're getting the people
together
to talk
about the discussion of
bacon and advancing
a sovereign renewable
energy development.
Through partnerships and
cooperation to
me it's quite clear
that it's us
to form
a think tank so
to speak to address
the sovereign
renewables.
Thank you madam chair
thank you Representative
Allison.
And madam chair you all and
and Representative Allison
The New. I think
it needs to be
written more sure
Shankly edge that's
me and you may get a
good you may have a good handle
on it I I think I
know what they're wanting but
I'm not sure exactly she has
what they will so that's
what I would I would recommend
that they just look into that it's
not it's not trying to get
away from whatever their meaning
is insurance
trying to write it better
to we're all of us get a better
handle on what they're what they're
saying. Thank
you Senator Griggs.
And then if we go down to
23.2.
3.2 shares
add pre
K. through
12 renewable energy
literature literacy
and project based learning
as part of the state educational
standards and
madam chair the I don't
have I
don't have terrible
concerns with
talking about renewable
energy and in the
in the schools but I
think you need to talk about all
kinds of the Energy
because you're you
don't know.
And in most
cases
we are
pretty comfortable
with Shea and you're
not going to get to
100 percent
reliable
renewable
energy any
time shin.
That if we do.
Great.
But New Mexico New
Mexico is blessed
with wind
solar
oil and gas
coal and we have
opportunities with all of those
things New Mexico
has the opportunity to be
worldwide leader
in the integration
of energy systems
innovation energy
development
and yet we continue
to push
yes approach
to renewables
absent
the approach of utilizing
even better
the energy that we've
got. And
the you know in California
they they change their
wall to
identify natural
gas as a renewable
source of energy because they
know.
They know that they can't
get all the energy they need
from renewable sources.
Without having natural
gas availability
tool
site.
I thank you for goal
for goal is to
completely get away
from oil and
gas is going to be something
but it's not going to be an
achievable goal
in the immediate or
near goal near time
future and I I just
think why don't
we why
don't we embrace what
we have.
In Schecter and talk about
all of those things
which which which
utilize what New Mexico's
got to make it
the place we all know it can
be.
Last last thing and then
I'll be I'll be done
but if we
if we go down to
4.2
and it says asked the
Legislature to provide
paid professional development
incentives and
steam support
materials on energy
efficiency and
sustainability to
public Katie 12 educators
and administrators and I
just the same thing
have the same thought
process
is energy
efficiency using all
forces not just
focusing on.
This.
And that and that's what I
would I would like there's a
whole lot better if
you talked around those
things some too because
it certainly appears that it
is a the
one dimensional directional
document
and.
For my part of the world
and for staff that I
I see in my
business life and have seen
and continue to see
I think we've a we've
got some severe challenges
real challenges
in trying to get
to what the issues
trying to do.
But it doesn't mean we can't
get to it it
doesn't mean we can't
utilize what we
have how can
we use it in ways it
may be is maybe they're
cleaner if our
concern is a need to be
cleaner had we help
making a claim.
If that's our concern.
Show me all I appreciate
your presentation madam chair
thank you for let me ask a
question.
Thank you senator
X..
Anybody
else.
Thank you for being
here we appreciate that I think
they're at you know as as I've
mentioned before this committee is very
curious and they like to ask questions
and they like to so
feel like how they can help use
what you've been able to do
to bring back to their communities but
also to make it a stronger
a stronger approach to
changing changing
policies and changing the way
we we kind of do things for
the better for our community so thank you
very much for being your
personal I think you're sticking around because
you're doing it to for
today.
It looks that way it does
thank you so
we we appreciate
that.
Next we have
some friends of ours from Deming where
we were yesterday so
if Cassie this
ward who is the economic and tourism
development coordinator for the city of
Deming wants to come on
down.
This is what we need the price is right
theme music
right and if they pull that up really
quickly yeah I'm
up here individually yet
no they're all going to come up and sit with
you we've
got Jackie Jackie
how do I say your last name
latest cat wanted to make sure I got
that right who is a community
development director of the town of
Silvercity Christie and
Harvey who is the executive director
of the greater Luna County economic
opportunity council
and
then.
That's what happens here in this
committee yet
and then Emily tell me how to say your
last name.
Gregoritsch and
I'm CENIC with names
are important I want to make sure I get it
right and Emily going to the
2 is the economic development specialist
for the city of Lordsburg
really representing
you know the great parts about western
New Mexico so I'm really glad to have
all of you and your different
perspectives on this we've
got a panel of 5 which is
actually really good because we're about
20 minutes earlier in
advance so
you've got a little bit more
time
it in full transparency to
the committee I
am working with the city of
Deming
on some opportunities for
public lands and so I just want to
have that out there is that
in my work capacity I'm having
that lovely opportunity
at to move forward and
we actually have a town hall
in 2 weeks 2 weeks
from today right.
Yes tuition today
we're not a town hall a
meeting with your commissioners and
your council rise
our round table
thank you for for how we're
we're billing that and so
I appreciate Cassie for organizing
that so I'm gonna turn it over
to you for you
to talk about economic development
needs of rural New Mexico
because we
know of many of us
who are representing rural parts
of our state the what happens
in our rural communities is
completely different or what the
needs are in our rural
communities is completely different from
those in our urban parts of our
state and
that one of the things
that we take great pride in is
knowing that New Mexico is unlike
any other state in the country
and that are different regions are unlike
any other different regions in the
state. And
so it's important for us to bring our
voices and to hear those
voices when it comes down to creating
policy law that
will help our rural communities
thrive when they're ready for it
they're just chomping at the bit for
it so I'm gonna let you
go ahead and start and that
the floor is all
yours.
All ladies again which is
awesome. The
whole day is all
women.
Madam chair do you want to go according
to the agenda as far as
Senator you know I'm out of
that matter to me because
however you want to do it I'm gonna if
you've got some sense of organization
go for it.
Otherwise you know
personally you already so I don't know if
you want to take like a like
a a backseat since you've you've been
featured you've been a featured guest
already right
yeah.
Hello Committee madam chair I
would like to extend
a warm welcome to
Silvercity on behalf of the
tennis over city
and it's going to be presenting some of
the
economics of the Thames
river city as well as
some of the needs of the
area so I
started off at some quick facts
of just like demographic
information median
household income
employment
and some facts
about our residents
so we have kind
of a higher poverty rate
compared to a
lot of the state
so low
income is something
and accessible activities
to people is something that we really
like to highlight at the
town to ensure
that there's a lot
of activity among
the population and
so Jessica is
going from the the handout
that you all have in front of
you. The town
of Silvercity across the
front.
Thank you
just.
And then we reference our work force
so we
have.
Okay thank and
so one of the
driving economic factors
in our in our area
is
education health care and social
services that's one
of the main of
workforce motivators
in the area and that
has been kind of
highlighted with the fact
that we have a very
low
housing stock in the
area so we have like
doctors or
teachers trying to come into the
area that there's
not much housing available
for them so
the tennis of our city has started
since 2000 to
try and
increase the availability
for affordable housing
and one of the projects was
the the Mountain View
senior apartments
so since 2000 it's
been about
270
a units have been
installed with tennis over
city in funding from the
state and federal levels
of but.
There's still a very
large need
for teachers
healthcare workers
tradesmen in
our area so the
tennis of our city has been working on an
initiative called the vistas the Platt
the subdivision which
is the 56 lot
subdivision it's
based on the
affordable housing
requirements by MFA
so right now there
are I believe 8
lots that has
been constructed
and there's 2
available for houses to be put on
but we are
meeting us
some difficulties
with funding
like
as everybody has and in the
recent years with just the
increase of costs
of building as well
as
drainage and and securing
contractors to be able to do
work we have
now
started to look at expanding the
area but the costs have
become pretty high
for the town to be able
to to be able
to do independently
so we're actively looking for
funding and if you see on
page 5 there's some of the
faces have been
documented about what
kind of cost that those
areas would be we
have secured a
of an agreement with
requests over city that
have has been instrumental in
the completion of
phase one B. and
the whole subdivision is
K. of curbing that aired
has water pavement
and sidewalks and
curbs.
And we're currently working
with MFA to change our
ordinances and our covenants
in the subdivision to increase
the and my 250
percent so
we'll have more access
to people in the area not just
extremely low or low income
but you know 2 income families
are are something that
is basically a
necessity in the state and age
so it's important to be able
to kind of grow
with
with the changing times but
also open those
opportunities to people
so families can have
houses.
And one of the things that Silvercity
is very proud of it
is
it's events and
tourism so
we have a lot of events
in the area of the tour of the Gila
the wild west rodeo
fiesta let the not the clay
festival
the the southwest
print yes the blues fest
the gem and mineral show the red paint
power while
various car shows
I need that the Moss pub crawls
chocolate fantasia and
pretty much from spring
to fall our
park has been reserved for
an event so we have a lot
of people coming from you know kind
of the tri county area
to come to Silver City to
enjoy the weather to
go just take a walk downtown
in order to see the music in the
festivities that we have going
on. So one
of the projects that the town
has been working on over the
last couple years was a
conceptual for the big
park so
where the topic
is currently located there's
another lot just adjacent
to the south that
we're hoping to expand
the park to
increase outdoor
recreation among our residents as
well as visitors but
have that space to be able
to be used for
events and to be able
to expand the events because right now
sometimes we have all those streets
closed off and
then it it reduces parking
you know it reduces traffic
flow so it's
it would be great to have
some funding for that have
that happening over here
we currently have it on ICAP
for $3000000
is needed to
get the project on
the ground but that
big ditch park is
the big park extension
would have volleyball courts
volleyball.
The outdoor amphitheater
basketball courts
and then an elevated bridge that
would connect to the big ditch
park penny park and the sense
of the trail.
So another thing that the
town has been working on
is our parks
as well as
trails and
connectivity so
the centers and the creek
received capital outlay
funding for
$150000
from Senator
Hemphill and so we've
been working on increasing the
ADA accessibility in
the park as well as
the outdoor classroom we've
been working on future
plans with the greenways
plan to
extend and
increase connectivity from
like the northern most parts of the city
to the like the court the
downtown hub and then
extend it down to like
the ball parks
in the golf course
so people could have the
if the opportunity to like
walk and
have a more pedestrian
friendly opportunity
in that way so
one of those projects was
the silver creek
trail which is connected with
the rock house
on page 12
so the rock has been of
a very big project
that we are proud to
show off and it is part of
the 5 points initiative
between Silvercity arenas
valley.
A Santa Clara
Baird and her really
and so the
Broncos would be
the
Senator are the hub
for the
CD tree trick the CD
T. trail rock roll
walkers and
it would be a connection
for them to come and you Silver
City as their
area to
re up on their supplies
you know kind of take a walk around
kind of get their little siesta
going on will have
a
camping spot showers
kitchens available
and a lot of work is been done in
most of it I believe like 90
percent of it has been done by volunteers
or by workers to the youth
conservation corps
that project has been funded
through the New Mexico
tourism department save
America's treasures the
O. R. D. E.
capital outlay New
Mexico department of transportation
colonus infrastructure
and Freeport mac Moran so we're very
thankful for all of those funds that
we have received
and we're hoping to
see you know the
the completion and the for wishin
of that connectivity happening
to increase the
connectivity not only in our city
but throughout our
our rural
communities.
And then there's been
a lot of work at Scott
parks golf links so
we host a lot of
tournaments since we're kind
of one of the
one of the areas for the southwestern
region to connect
for baseball
soccer golf
tournaments so
the some isn't the trail actually
goes all the way down to
those parks
so we're trying to
create this
big just power house
to be able to connect all of these
areas so people
who are moving
into town see that
there's opportunities for children
for families as well
as for our
seniors and
retirees to
have the opportunity to
you know keep that health and
vitality going with the
outdoor recreation that is
really a big big
motivator of to people
to move over here thank you mentioned
earlier madam chair that
350 days of sun
I mean it's kind of funny right now
but we
we do
we do benefit from that weather
so people are very
very
attracted to that.
And then so on the last page
it just kind of gives a breakdown of some of the
places that I talked
about how they
reach the
span through Silvercity
on to our outskirts
and if you have any
questions madam chair committee of the
vote to answer anything
I appreciate your
time.
Thank you so much we'll go ahead and we'll have
all of you and and I'm writing
down like who I have questions
for so
I think because we've got a full panel
I that if you've got a particular
question if you come up with a
bunch that's what I'm
doing so I'll I'll let you continue
last questions
afterwards.
Madam chair members of the committee
a good afternoon I
I appreciate you entertaining
me twice in 2 days
thank you for so for not making me follow
you
I I just
am happy to be here
Cassie this for the city of
Deming tourism and economic development
coordinator within that
capacity I serve as the executive
director for demolition county economic
development and then I
also have the privilege of serving
as a treasure from the New Mexico
partnership the vice
president for New Mexico idea
and I also sit on the
southwestern area workforce development
board so I hope that
you see some of that perspective kind of
lease through my free
presentation I knew this was a
5 person panel
so.
I'll let go ahead and get started
here so I I'm gonna speak a little
bit to our
community
in general
one thing that that always
leaves me feeling a little bit
impressed whenever I leave a
conversation with site
selectors or trade shows
or pretty much
anybody who will listen to me talk about my
community.
Is the
people that we have in our
community have for
generations knowing how
to work hard
do hard jobs
and we I can say that and
back it up with the fact that we
have amazing industry
in our community so
for instance OFI is a
green chili and jalapeno processor
no where else in the world so
you see the scale
of processing
that they do and we
serve them out of Deming New
Mexico you got a chance
to tour the winery last
night the largest winery in the
state allowed and
I I think you I would assume
that you left
nothing short of an off
of the mass and the
presence that they bring to our
community and we're able
to serve them with the people that we
have and we have
a a great
community if
you those of you that went to the border
plexi heard about that you know
2000000 plus labor shed
that we're right on the cusp
of and that is something that we work
regionally to
articulate to
industry that's looking to re
locate because that's
not something that the data
shows so it's something
that we actively work on.
The next piece that I want to talk about
is place.
Demings is truly
a logistically
advantageous
competitor for New
Mexico whenever it
comes to proximity
to rail access
rail
air.
I would troubling care
interstate
and international
opportunities
and so whenever you think
about
rural communities you're
not typically thinking about accessible
communities and
Deming uniquely is
both of those things which leads us
right into this last point that sets
Deming part and
not as profitability
we are able to
talk to community
to industry that's looking
to relocate or
expand and
offer them a
logistically competitive
option that does not
slow down their speed to market
with some of those rural
designations whenever we're pulling
together incentive packages take
J. tip for example with
our rural designation they're able
to get a higher reimbursement
on that
package so
we're we're affecting not
bottom line and that makes us a
great competitor
as a community for the state of New
Mexico.
So dig into the me a little
bit here of the
we are for the
presentation.
You have some really great presenters
talked about site readiness
yesterday
I'm not going to rehash all of
that but
overall
that site readiness
program that we're talking
about truly
just will aid our
capacity as a rural
community to be
competitive for both foreign
and domestic opportunities that come
through our community with those strengths
that we've we've just gone
over I know that
we're going to hear more
on some of the broadband
initiatives and
development closer to the
border one of the cool
things about Deming is that all of the
strings that I talked about are
not fully tapped potentials
there's a lot of room for growth in
them.
Outdoor recreation
we have 4 state parks within
our our community
which is huge so we're not just pulling
it out of the air and jumping on the
bandwagon
to to work with outdoor
recreation
and to
to say it lightly let's
keep supporting the things that are
working across
the board with outdoor recreation
we does detect those things help
our rural communities.
And the last point that that I'll
leave you with here as as a
priority for our community
is is
beautification
I'm not typically a person who cares
a whole lot about what people think of me
individually but I'm
surprisingly
very
I care a whole lot about what people think
of my community whatever they drive
through they drive to New Mexico
and I'm like
everybody else in this room you see those
YouTube videos I'm sure everybody
thought with all these New Mexico
communities that are not great to live
in that
has to change and we need to do
that from a state level and we can
work with
allocating funds to
the DOT to help on beautification
projects for the infrastructure that
goes through New Mexico
so if you're unfamiliar up I.
10 is basically the I. 40
of the south
whenever we have over
30000 vehicles
that go through our little piece of
that quarter a day
we've got to do better on the
infrastructure that is
inviting and aesthetically
pleasing to folks to get them
off the interstate and help
us retain the population that we
have and recruit some new
population.
And with that I
will close with a
quote from the back we are a
very ambitious region
and southern New
Mexico
and we appreciate the action that
you're taking in the time that you're taking
a listen to us to help our
projects be brought
to fruition and be successful
madam chair members of the committee thank
you.
So cristiana
Emily you can arm wrestle and
figure out who
goes.
If you will point that.
Correct.
Okay is that
better.
The chair Hamblen.
Vice chair committee members
it's a pleasure to be here and it's
an honor my name is Christine and
Harvey I'm the executive
director of the
greater Luna County economic
opportunity council
I'm also the designated
BDO for Luna County
we work hand in hand
as much as we can
which is something
that we'll be doing more of
with Cassie and the amazing
work that she does for
damning we're a very
United community with great
opportunity
and as you've heard
from Cassie
before I get into it we are
extraordinarily well
positioned
for achievement
and expansion we have the only
24 hour report in the
state we have
open land
we have a developing
industrial port
in Columbus at the county is
helping with so we
have a great deal that we
can achieve I'm
also very
proud member of
the New Mexico
border Authority 3 times
appointed by the governor to that
position along
with many of your help
from the rules committee
as well as a full
Senate.
I'm gonna try to
brief this up a little bit
because I'm sure you are going to have a
great deal of question
something.
Thanks you're
all familiar with cathedral
thanking the over arching
thinking about
planning
vision and
sticking to it to make things
happen this is something
that the.
This is something that
uniquely applies to
economic development
many people don't understand
economic development very
well because it's not like just
building a stretch of
road it's very
encompassing the
figures fingers
go into
every other discipline
out there it's a very unique
group of people that work very
hard on this and I
applaud you for being on this
committee because every one of you
demonstrates the the
concern in the understanding
for what needs to be
done.
I've got some.
The statistics I'd like to point
out to you that I
feel are
challenges for Luna County
one of them is
our our
unemployment currently it's
8.7 percent of
3.6 for the
state historically
Luna County runs anywhere
from 12 to 15 percent
down to the low that it is
now so
overall the state is
making some significant
progress through
the actions that the governor's
taken and you is
legislators
legislate tors
approve in the direction
that we're going and the
influx of industry
through the leader programme
and obviously work is being
done at some point today
so but the point
is that we our
store Klay a
very poor
place and we're under
and not employed
the population is
forecasted to Landel
from the current
25000
to less than
22000.
In the next several years
we have a
condition where we
have older people
moving and that are 62
and older we
have our younger
people that are being
educated
and the current work
force that are
having out migration
this is not a good
sign for Luna County
so we're developing plans
to attack that
also Luna County has been
declared as being in the state
of chronic
poverty we
have a poverty rate of
27.6
percent this
surpasses the national
average of
11.6
to the last 40
years that's
very
impactful.
And the median household
income is reported to be
33914
which is 21000
less than the state average
and 45000
less than the US
average.
So while all those
are astoundingly poor
statistics
I with everybody else
and not this panel wants to
say that we have
amazing people we're
very creative
and we don't like being
in last place we're not
last class
people
in our conversation with the
governor silver spikes when
our group went up
there
I mentioned the same thanks
to her we have unique
opportunities that are not
being capitalized
particularly at the southern
border of Luna
County
with the land new land port
of entry in the development
of the Columbus industrial
park you've all seen
incredible things that have happened
it's opportunity for
and it is mind
boggling and I'm sure
you've seen the recent
note from the governor of the
announcement that
there is another
amazing industry
coming their car
part manufacturer
of okay here's
another one from Taiwan
the point being that with
all this amazing development
is happening
and yesterday I was at
the better
better a better borders
for a better America in el
Paso and some of
the statistics I heard were pretty
incredible back to back
up in el Paso
of 3 plus hours to
get to the border.
In order to today says much
better than
that
I will say that the Columbus
industrial park or
the lan port of entry
there is very under
utilized at
we've had times when it's been an
hour I would imagine
now it's less than half an
hour so we're so
under utilized there
is plenty of room for
growth
there.
So we have these issues
that I've talked to you about and
then I've got propose solutions
one is a prioritization
of technical and trade
education and certificate
opportunities
verses 2 to 4
year degrees and it's not that
the 2 to 4 year degrees are
not extremely important because
they are but we also
have a need in our county for
people to go get a technical
education get
a certificate and go
to work with our
with our people
now we are
in need of job
opportunities
now we have an
out flowing
of
people and a few people
that we have left mechanical
contractors builders are
absolutely overwhelmed
they cannot handle
the demand so
we end up going to Los
crucis and other places to
bring people in and
they're also equally backed
up.
Funding
we're looking for one of the
solutions is additional funding
for the Columbus
industrial park to
attract new
industry
I had the
the affordable high speed
broadband project for
the county.
And we have just
established a coalition
and we are working
on solutions
to an engineering study that we
recently obtained from
family engineering to
establish a affordable
high speed broadband for
everybody and
in our operations and
our county and I'll relate
some details to you
in a minute Cassie
is been very good implementing
a high touch personal
outreach to
people
we're also working on that
to the county particularly with the
department of health
as well as with Dr
shepherd on the creation
of a additional
facilities at the learning
center and damning
I also created through
the
through my nonprofit.
A Film Office we did
that about a month ago
we have a gentleman by the name of
Troy
that was last at the
moment. And
we have appointed film
commissioner we've had meetings
with bonded capital
and buffalo right there
in California
they're a very large film
production company and we're
working with them to
find a way to build a
studio
we also work
on housing as well
as.
On 2 fronts really affordable
housing but
primarily our work
has been for market
rate housing and the
purpose for the market rate
housing agency to attract the
professionals that are needed
at the hospital.
The schools
and other industries in our
state because we
have people that come in they have
no place to live right
now
the affordable housing is
also extremely important
to us right now we have a very
low housing inventory
we're also working on breaking
down silos that
limit our ability
to communicate with people you
I've heard since I've been here
today
that many
agencies don't communicate
well they don't meet well
and somebody being maybe working
on something and there somebody
else working on the same thing and
we could collaborate to reduce
the time to get things
done.
And with you chair
Hamblen there was a great meeting
the other week we appreciate
that and I'm very well aware of
the meeting that and tell all the
Cassie set up which
is great because we also
believe that there is a real
need for a development
of a regional outdoor
recreation asset
inventory as
well as a job
assessment.
We do support the
development of open trails
land and and
your operation and what
you have done with the
organ
mountains
monument.
We also would like to provide
leadership for the
leave no trace sustainable
tourism destination.
And we have advocacy in
support of tourism
also through Cassie but
also through so we like
to support you in those additional
efforts as I said
earlier it's amazing what we
learned from me when what you've
accomplished
there.
We'd also like with your
help and cities
to sponsor development of the
tourism master plan we
think that can be extremely helpful
to us.
Many outcomes one is
obviously the access
to technical training and certification
such as welding that we
already have we
work with top Dr shepherd
they have committed to bring
to new
programs in January
to the learning center
that's going to be in the construction
trades at some
drywall
and framing
there is a current welding
class there that's working
very well but we're also working
on
changing the
commercial
driving license class we have
CDO to
improve that
we're working on flooding
problems building new
roadways and installing
broadband in the industrial park
in Columbus we know
that that creates a demand for
new industries that operate
cross border the
specially agriculture and
value added
operations that you see
today happening in order to
put any so.
Of the access to affordable
high speed internet supports
retains.
Remote workers that improves
online learning
and sets the stage for attracting
location neutral
workers
housing I've already touched
on that recreation
again it enhances
the outdoor recreation
product and development
supports place making
and improves the quality of
life for our
locals of tracks
visitors and it
supports
location neutral
workers.
It's very important what we do here
today because 20
years down the road
from today Luna
County is going to be
as it is or
it is going to become the vision
that we talk about
today for
many years Luna
County has lagged
behind
and.
It's not because
we
are.
It's not because we're not
capable often times
the border areas neglected
very honestly because it's
viewed as an
area that may
not be well suited
for economic
development
and I'm
here as well as everybody at
this panel and you're fully aware
of that we are
a great opportunity for
all of you and
your help to make a huge
difference in the direction that
we go and what we
can add to the
state.
Happy are those the dream
dreams are willing to pay the
price to see them come
true. I'm
a firm believer in
positive thinking.
Having our technical
education we're
going to be seeking additional
funding and curriculum for
local CTE career
and technical education
programs Dr
shepherd is absolutely been
wonderful in working with
us but we will
need further money if we're
going to increase our impact
and build out a construction
facility
to augment
what is being
done.
Would like to bolster
local firms overwhelmed
with the service calls in the
adequate number the
an adequate number of trained or
certified employees.
Improve our inadequate non
trained work force to enhance
attraction of new business
and support pouch primary
growth.
And Purcell we work
together before I'd like to
prioritize our partnership
and continue working with
you for
the attraction of
entrepreneurs one in
particular would be
the co starters
program I've had the pleasure
last 3.5 years
teaching 4 classes
and Luna County with
family and I can
tell you the that is a
highly successful program
working with people that want
to start business or
that I've recently started in
business to give them the
tools the road maps and the
connections that they
need to be
highly
successful.
We also have a major
collaboration under way
with the office of broadband
access and
expansion.
We are seeking additional
curriculum and funding
through them this is a conversation
I just had with our
outgoing director Kelley
Slagle on that we will
continue with the in term
director
we.
We set forth
in Luna county on the
broadband.
Face to try to
understand the lay of the
land where the
money is going who
has who has
it and how we connect people
we have a very high
rate of digital distress
in our county which is
a major to tractor
to economic development
education and
telehealth
we had
we retain Finley engineering
to do a report for us a
feasibility study
on what needed to be
done to connect
everybody and
what we found is that there
are in excess of 2000
people under all current
plans all current
requests and everything
that has been a male available
to us and
and meetings that we've had with
people that under no
understood under no
current circumstances
are going to be connected to high
speed broadband.
So the feasibility study was
just that what is the
feasibility
of Luna County possibly
becoming utility to reach
these people or
how do we best work with
our incumbent
ISPs
or Hey a new
one that some of you may not be
familiar with and that's resound
networks out of pocket
taxes they
won Hey
art off auction a reverse
auction to
provide internet
throughout many places in the
US for $303000000 and three
million dollars and I believe
about 52000000 of
that was for
New Mexico
or for Luna County
actually.
One of our goals is also
being ready for industrial
development at the border I
noticed that are more
from Columbus is
here and more I'm
glad that you're here we
appreciate working with you
in the good work that you
do.
Unfortunately New Mexico
significantly behind other
states in attracting direct
foreign investment in capturing
other opportunities for near
shoring and supply
string of supply
chain strengthening
I know that flies in the face
of what you recently know
about order of today so
because there is been tremendous
amazing investment
and significant opportunity
there but
overall the state
still lacks in that obviously
we're going in the right direction
and your help in achieving
the direction in maintaining
and sustaining it is
critically important
to improving loan up to
excuse me to improving
the state and the entire
board in the border
region
we obviously work with the
department of
economic development and
the border
Authority
we're working on strategic
planning right now in addition
to the 12 major projects
that are underway at the border
Authority.
We.
Our county manager
has attained
5.$5000000
to work on the infrastructure
build that at
the
industrial park in
Columbus
he is also finished
maintaining or getting
the necessary money over the past
several years I think
it's about $19000000
at this point to
stand the
flooding that happens
whenever it rains
which is rarely
and southern Luna County
but that we are
that whole region
where the lan port
of entry is as well as
the
industrial park Columbus
and even close Mexico's
in a flood plain there's
about 1355
acres there
in that flood plain
and it can be very tragic when
it rains we can actually get several
feet of water and
the reason that is important
among the damage that it
does to existing
businesses and stuff is that you
can't have development at
the industrial park
because it's in a flood zone and they
can't get flood
insurance at
this
time.
So through the money to Chriss
obtain Luna County takes
lead to build a berm project
out that stamps the
flooding the our
of peas will go out for
that
soon and that work
is expected to start in the first
quarter of next
year.
That's part of what we do with the border
Authority and Luna County
as a there's
a collaboration to
reach out to to to
all law New Mexico
manufacturing operations
particularly related to electric
vehicle supply chain
and other industries
associated with
advanced energy
technology
we focus on workplace
development effort key industry
stated to support current
and future
industry the
high speed broadband I've
already touched on
we have a high rate of
digital distress and for
those of you that that sounds
like a strange term
what it means is
that the majority of
our population does not
have access
to 25
over 3 megabytes
the new FCC standard
this point established to apply
for the B. grant
is a minimum of 100
megabytes over 20
megabytes and what
that means to those of you that may
not be familiar with that
is that it's an
inadequate and insufficient
speed where you can
not conduct
business telehealth
or even education for
students because the
band with is so small
the the rates of
exchange because
digitizing
in the actual
of a vision
or a loss of contact
with
people.
And obviously the service
to help business and health care
providers students and
remote workers
gain access to sufficient
speed to improve economic
development
online residential system
and educational
systems.
S. tactics to
re. To
work on these issues we
support our grant comments
which are localized
peas as well as I
mentioned resound networks
who is rather new to us
as they work to implement their
plans all the
current plans that are currently
in place take anywhere from
4 to 6.5 years
to complete so
that means that there are
people today that
will be coming high school
freshman and
they may well graduate
before everybody has
access to this
critical need
for broadband.
That's a major statement because
without that there are certain
things that we just cannot
accomplish
so the as
you all know the government is
a process
it's it it takes
time to do things and when
you have large amounts of money through
federal grants they
don't roll out
overnight
what we're looking at in the county
is how do we augment that
and how do we reach or
speed up the process to get
the some of these people as soon as
we possibly can
we partner with them in public
schools and nobody also
broadband access
and expansion to support
targeted student
populations we
recently learned through work
done I don't buy that there are at
least 1000 students
in the democratic schools
that still
do not have access to broadband
or what they have access
to is not adequate
for them to work or they
still don't have a device
or worship they don't have the
knowledge on how to access
that device and communicate
over the
internet.
We can do
our tactics are obviously to
continue a
public engagement
work with ACP the
American connect connectivity
plan recipients in
partnership
my nonprofit as well
as.
El Paso community foundation
in Los crucis community
foundation where the recipient
of a $300000
ACP grant
so that we could develop
the capacity to go out and
reach our
rural
places particularly in
Columbus and
bring
devices to them teach them
how to use the internet and also
sign him up for this subsidy
to the federal
government.
Cristiana ask you to I
know you're getting toward the end I just want
to make sure that are the 2 speakers have
a chance not college
eyes I have way too much
in here could have had a little bit
better organized
anyway let me let me move forward
with some closing
remarks.
It's very obvious what is
won't be what was
isn't and it's
not what we do right now that
matters it's what we cost to
happen so with that
I'll stand for your question when it's
appropriate in turn Michael
for to
the best one here
you.
We also still have Priscilla so
we want to make sure that both of you have a
chance to talk.
Next to you I'm just
assumption.
Show wrap it up thank
you go ahead good
afternoon madam
chair and vice chair of the
committee met meet up
members of
welcome to Silvercity this
is actually my home
as well I'm a native of
Silver City I grew up
here left
a couple times and came back
and I
love rural New
Mexico I am going to give
you a little different
perspective
I am the economic development
specialist for the city of
Lordsburg
however.
The first 12 years of
my career I
had the privilege of working
with Priscilla at
are caught district
so as
you hear the ladies on
the panel speak
about each one of our
communities here in the
southwest
even though I work for the city
of larkspur I will always
be in their
backseat Cherry that
money for whatever projects
are moving forward
what I would like to bring
to the table is
not only
the perspective of
an even smaller
community David
Deming and
Silvercity
but it brings it
all talk about the challenges
that I've I've seen in the very
short time that I've been with the
city of Lordsburg
as well as the
importance of rural
communities working together
which in our
region they
do
very.
Graciously at
and are
actually it's an
amazing partnership our
whole region of
local governments
have.
So I can
tell you that I
have been working with a couple
private
industry.
Partners and
when we're trying to move a
project forward
and we invite state
agencies to the
table.
It it is quite.
Disheartening when
we have all
these state people that don't
want to come to the table
but they want to be in the state
or or ask
questions when
we when we invite them
to the table to have that
conversation in the
forefront and
asks there are hard questions
to that private
industry.
Really it is our job
as economic development
professionals to get
that project over the
line and
tried to mitigate some of those
issues that we're
seeing
in those conversations
but when I
have.
Force different state
agencies coming at me
saying well this
one says this and that
one says that and this
one says this and
we're trying to get to the root of the
problem and then we
cannot because
nobody ever wants to come to the
meeting.
Somebody at our
state agencies
needs to be that
champion they need
to come that at the table
especially in rural
communities it's hard
enough to land
a project but
then to work
through trying
to get them their trying
to get them all the technical
assistance that needs to
happen from
right aways
to permissions
to all these regulations
in hoops that we
have
and then.
Like I said they just don't want
to participate
it it's and then we have to
bring in our state
representatives took
to the table to make something
happen it shouldn't
be that hard
I value all
the partnerships we do have
in the state
agencies
but we do need to have
somebody at our state
agencies level
to be that
liaison for
economic development
like Cristian said
there's a lot of moving parts
to economic development
you can be the grant writer
and the project manager to this
day and you're going
to recruit businesses the
next day so there's a lot of
shifting gears
and it's hard to keep track
of okay did I email
them all that should have to follow
up. And it
makes the job
of an economic development
professional
a little bit more
difficult and then when
you're working in a
small community where
you're with.
Having to wear a
lot of different hats
because we don't have the staff
to have a grant writer on hand
we don't
have
main street director
or other
partners to come to the table
you are the
everything
aged it would just help that
process a little bit
better
I do have to
say I.
E..
Was a little disheartened
because we were awarded
a tourism
grant and
when I went to a
private
business to ask if we could do
a photo shoot at their business
they said what do
you mean New Mexico
remembered us.
I said that
hurts so
we we have to do a
better job of representing
all areas
of New Mexico
I'm sure that small
communities in your
counties feel the
same exact way as
that private industry
owner I'm not saying
this to bash
state agencies
I'm not saying that to
to do anything other than
to bring awareness
that rural New
Mexico is just as
important.
And I would
like to also add that
I think you guys are doing
an amazing job and there
are amazing
programs for rural
communities the
the recreation grant that
just was
due the other date that
doesn't have a match
component that
helps tremendously
it helps bring
amenities to small
communities that normally
wouldn't happen because they
would have to match it by 30
percent or
better
the new New Mexico
mainstreet I
will always be a cheerleader
for New Mexico mainstreet
that is one of the best
programs not only
for small communities
but for urban areas as
well they do
great work and they
have amazing people
also
I that's all I
really want to bring to the
table I just want you to
be aware that there are
some issues that we
need to work through
and do better
because private industry
not going to wait for New Mexico
to say yes they're
going to either.
Help work through us
or they're going to move
on.
So madam chair all
continue
with my presentation
and so
I'm just going to get hit some of the
highlights for me
and so if anybody knows anything
about the work that I've
done over 30
years it's really around
infrastructure
and that without
infrastructure which is our
basic needs we have
nothing.
So something that I'm seeing
over the years of
of work and infrastructure
is the more I'm in
this job the more emergencies
I'm seeing around water
infrastructure
especially seeing
more now around the waste
water and the
impacts of
those
infrastructure needs and the most
rural communities that are
still in some cases
have says pools
and how it's impacting
our groundwater and
so we need to be cognizant
of that
so I thought I
would showcase one project
that we've been working on since
when I was very
new to the council of governments a
very naive very
shy which most people don't
believe
but at
that point we
came to the table in
Grant County all the all the
local governments to
discuss our regional water
project and
if you would have been that that meeting
you would have said this is never
going to work you
fast forward now 30
years and
now it's a priority
right because things have
changed right and
sold or we're looking at
things differently so now we have
a Grant County regional water
project I local
governments 11
minutes of the mystics
it will provide water from
the town are currently all the way
back into Silvercity to
Tyrone and from
Tyrone all the way back
up to her early so
that is a major
accomplishment
but it's it's a lot
of education and
sacrifice and so
that's one of that showcases
that I wanted to bring for today
so it can
happen but
that is really going to be an
economic driver and
so my goal is always to ensure
public safety and
how that creates economic development
in our communities and
so really proud so we have
the actual engineering money
to update the plan and
now we have the design
money and we're on to the
next page and then be the
construction dollars so
and it's been a
a cultivation of partnerships
in which. Freeport
McMoRan has about provided
200 acre feet of
water to
the town of Hurley.
And also
250 acre feet
of water to the villages
on the product for the whole
region a water project
so it
just goes to show you just
don't ever give up right
so the other one is that I
want to teach highlighted
childcare we're seeing
challenges in our areas
whether on telecare
we've highlighted some projects
in which there was some summer
youth programs as well after
school programs
we're seeing more of that and I
think we need to continue to do that
to be able to accommodate
some of these professions in
which they have 10
to 12 hour days and
so we need to go beyond what is a
normal work day with
that I
also want to elaborate
on the entrepreneurship
program this is
one of
Emily's
as an employee of mine that
was really her vision
and I've got to say that it's been a
very successful one and
that is the co
starters program that we
have been implemented in the
southwest corner
and so
I've got to say
during the COVID
and are different most difficult
times we created
jobs during
the COVID with this co
starters program which is a
10 week course
for individuals who are
planning to start their own business
and we have to celebrate facilitators
that have been trained we
were able to secure money from
economic recovery dollars
from from the economic
development administration
and so it started prior
to that but from the funding that
we see from the federal
there's been about 160
participants in the park any
region there's about
46 new
businesses that have been
started some of those businesses
were maybe already
started
so we're going to continue that
momentum some of the
local governments are contributing
are but dollars and
giving them to us to continue
that momentum for
future years to continue
support small businesses
I would love to see that implemented
at the state around the
state.
And the other one
is health and safety
we've got to take care of our rural
communities are rural healthcare
clinics
our regional Medical
Center
how important it is to have
initiatives are around
that so that we can
really be a viable location
to be able to attract
economic development because we
need that that health
care correct and
so we also need to
ensure that we have a
mechanism in which those equipment
needs are being replaced
because when we talk about some of these rural
areas and the ambulances are they
have to commute 2:00 hours
and they're commuting with
450000
miles we're taking
a person's life
into their hands right
in our hands because they don't
have the
adequate.
Vehicle or in the
8 the adequate equipment
to be able to do their job
and so those are things that I think I'm it
from an economic development
standpoint I
already have is that it
talked about a little bit about the
training programs I think we
need to continue that
and so I have a couple of
recommendations that I
would really
like to see move forward
and that is.
One of the things that I want to say
is that we're having so many
emergencies across the
state that I think we need
to develop a prices fund
because we cannot wait
when we have an emergency whether it's
and water whether it's
in waste water whether
it's in housing
whether it's flooding we
can't wait 2 or 3
years to
wait for something to be funded to
alleviate the situation
it just can't continue to
happen so when I
talk about the crisis fund
I wanted to be a little bit
broader and I think about
I think about all the infrastructure
needs whether that
water waste water
broadband whether it's
flooding whether it's a
local government that owns a
utility like gas for
example maybe
it's fire maybe
it's you know
public health and
safety
concerns so that
we can ensure that we're taking
care of our people
because with all our people we can't
we can't thrive on economic
development.
I'm again having
more training opportunities where
they're short term training
for we can do a week long
type of training or
shorter and again
looking at those things are going to
really help foster
some of those soft skills
within our within
our future
employees
challenges around how do we
create more
opportunities of for business
entrepreneurs at the local
level and some of the work
they've been doing recently I find
that some of the programs
just don't really work for them
right and so we
need to get better partnerships
between local
banks
and and this
and incentives to be able to
create those those
of small
dollars that need working
capital to move those
programs and those
businesses for forward
and again none of that
can happen if we're not hand
holding the businesses
of the local governments and moving
them forward so
that's what I've dedicated my life to
say I'd like to see some
increased of funding
for creating more
capacity at the
local level we're seeing
more turnover in
local governments
and where they're only
lasting a few months at a
time and
so that it
does not help
foster those opportunities especially
in the rural areas
when the limit
of people that can
really do the job is
is 8 we don't have that
kind of a population
to to hire
so I want to think about how we
do that better and
create capacity at
the local level and so
with that I'll leave it at
at that and I think I've
had that thought some of my highlights
and we all be happy to answer any questions
that you may have for us thank
you so much so we just got a huge
information dump from all of these
amazing women who are doing
great things in their community and I'm
really grateful for that
I don't necessarily have comments I just
have like maybe some some
just in terms of our connections and
really like all of us bring stuff to
the table of like how can we help
each other do our jobs better so for
Jackie.
You know the the big ditch park
up part of that was created because of
the land water conservation
fund and so
that might be some
monies that now because
of SB 9 because of the legacy
fund being able to
apply for that to get more
funds for the
expansion of that
that's the whole point of that fund
that fund is outdoor
outdoor recreation outdoor
accessibility
so I would look into the Senate bill
9 the legacy fund
and the land water conservation
fund there does have to be a
match with
all of you see a bump
but it's certainly worth
exploring and also do
you work with the continental divide
mmhm Association there like the continental
divide
nonprofit.
And so I'm really new to the
position are you see I
just got the official
position and June
the yeah.
Learning all these connections as time
goes on but I'm sure
she's holding my hand
sure.
You know about the continental the CDT
the the organization it's a
nonprofit
yes madam chair members
of the committee they are working in
collaboration
and so the southwest New
Mexico arts and culture district
actually works with them
and the tennis of our city does
have trails committees
that come together to visit
around those things and I think they've been looking
at some of the land ownership as
well right and
also you know you talk about like a
different communities have you
know the Deming duck races I mean that brings
people that normally would
not be going to I mean it all
and we all have all of our different
communities have these things it's just
like how do we up with
them and create
more awareness besides just
our community so you've got
the bike races here which is a
big draw for people in the cycling
community but it's not
necessarily something to draw that's for
everybody part of the
question we always have this conversation
about is whether or not our communities
have the infrastructure to be able to handle
all of that so that's like that
balance
right.
You know thinking Cassidy Cassie
you're talking about the beautification of
roads and that's what you
know at the entry point for
many of our small rural communities
is how does it look when
people come in and I know
I am just as guilty if I am
traveling across this country
is if I see a place that doesn't
look welcoming to me
I'm not going to stop.
And so we have
to like look at those and I
think you know Los
crucis has this really
that we've we've had this where are
our overpass bridges
and we are seeing this more that the
state is starting to embrace as more of
these artistic things we have
a a local artist name Collett
Marie who is been recognized
throughout the state for what
she's done for these overpasses
and I think I've had to you know
they just have the 2 little green
chillies which are
great but if
you look at the overpasses in Los
crucis I mean if we could
do things like that that are really
Representative and capture the
local area
like you know I mean I can imagine
like with representative Armstrong
is that you know like the
satellite dishes for
the VLA and the
different things that are brought in that
people know so
coral Magdalena for
is like if we could bring those in
as part of our overpasses and
like invite people into the
main exits I think of
that then exit that I always take to
get to my favorite convenience stores
I stop on my way up to Santa Fe
stop at that same one every single
time and like
we we've got these opportunities
like let's take a
and like let's harness our
own folks in
our communities to help up with
that because they know what what's the
heart beat of our communities
right. And
so
but I would the state
did something about that I think
the state funded
some of those bridges
the bridge kind of transformation
and how their artistic so that might be
something that we can
look at because and I also
think of Lordsburg
you know it's like my my my
mouth gets parched as I'm driving
through Lordsburg because it's
just it feels dry but I know
that you know that
there's so much more to that
community and
so you know it's like how do we
how do we build that
up the last thing I
was wondering is personally
you talked about the the co starters
program I'd really like
to know more about that
because you know our
entrepreneurs
are these folks who are willing to take
risks who are
creative in their
innovative and
they want to do something for
themselves a lot of people who start
their own businesses are because they're
people who are like I can't work
for other people anymore I've
got these ideas I want to help
them and the thing that we
recognize especially in rural
communities is that if you've got
intercontinental per
Norse they
need broadband.
Because most of their business
especially in smaller communities is
going to come from online.
Because there's only so much you can tap
into your local community to support
you as a business in any
business 2 things my friends are going to keep
me in business is just they're
not being realistic
and so we don't have
to do it here but if you can find
the information on that
I'd love to see how we can
try and do that other communities because
that's brilliant so madam
chair members of the committee I'll have
the opportunity to visit with you this
evening about that 0 great
okay good fantastic
okay so we have
Representative Lujan and
Senator Griggs I don't know if we have anybody
else who wants to ask
questions K.
J. Representative
Jim anybody
else
okay and then okay
all right so Representative
Lujan I do want to try and finish we
do have a public
comment so if we can finish that by
about
410.
That's good enough time just 30 minutes
right we can do it
okay so Representative Lujan your
first then Senator Griggs
Representative Jones and then representative
Duncan thank you madam chair
thank you all so how the panels that
was a lot of
information to get information
things we've been talking about for
quite awhile
so I just wanted
to to ask
just we're
take of of information and
clarification
your we're talking Luna County
was talking about
the expansion the
comparative
to send that to us so we're
disincentive suggested 2 weeks
ago with
NMFA
and so if we do that's what
you know this is
the second time I've
been out there
and.
My question it was a question
I have for Santa yes
says it there on incorporated
and they're going they're growing
exponentially.
Which to me was
where the safety met
here all the infrastructure
things that we're talking
about
how are you comparing that
to Luna County
in I
can you educate us a little bit me a
little bit more are you incorporate
Luna incorporated
were we missing
the opportunities there in
that direction madam
chair.
Madam chair and Representative
Lujan.
Well.
There are 2 main population
areas in Luna County the
overall population is about
25000
we have roughly
29000
that are living and
damning and then there's another
I'd say 1500
that are in Columbus both
of those are incorporated
areas other than that it's
all unincorporated
Luna County encompasses about
3000 square
miles so
the town of Columbus
is incorporated in that
surrounding
area
the industrial park that I
believe that you're probably referring
to in Columbus falls
into the
Columbus
incorporated
area
I'm not sure I understand your
question when you're asking about the
comparison of
it does not safety
or yep so what I
might my issue is is that we're
putting so much money
and and and focus
on an
unincorporated
of part of New
Mexico
and we have incorporated
small towns and
in counties were I
I'm just kind of putting this for my own
information piece and an
understanding what you
said to where our small rural
communities are asking
for when they have
this the infrastructure much to
which Priscilla is always
educating us about
is that standard.
And when we have that standard
we have these communities are
incorporated in their gives
us leverage to
grow so that's
that's really where I'm coming from
from this madam
chair.
Madam chair representative
I.
I'm gonna go back to a point I'm a
little bit earlier I think
oftentimes a border region has
been neglected to be very Frank
with you salt
aces been highly successful
they have a great advocate injury
but check over the work that he does
Harris well as our border
Authority.
Executive director Marco good
he the
Luna County is a little
bit new to this
in only in the recent years
I would say despite the
great efforts of past people
are from the Senate
and the Representative
has really beginning to be
the the bushes
and tried to get in front of you
and and let you know
about our our
needs so some
of that falls upon us
but I also
we ask for your cooperation
as we move forward because as I
said we have incredible and great
opportunities at the
border and the
border is expansive it's
not just in one
particular land port
of entry the manager
that's exactly that's a great
response thank you for that and I think
that that's we're we're
we are spending these dollars
in their taxpayers dollars
to for the growth
in for Economic
Development we we really need to be asking
these questions as well
my next question madam chair
is to
Priscilla
thank you again for so for staying
with us and being on an
extra panel and
everything 30 years and
everything's been doing
you're you're I don't know what
we're gonna do if
you were to year to retire
but bless you when
you're ready to do that madam
chair
you mentioned
a crisis fund so I
wanted to say we we we
had LESC meeting
up in
New.
Has Vegas New Mexico
and we are talking about this
and we had a presentation about
this so I'm just wondering
what have you been
inked them engaged in that
conversation with others and
what if we were to
have that fund and
look at appropriation
and and
a legislation for this what is that
number if any that
you may be thinking about right
now madam chair
term madam chair
and Representative Lujan
so we
have our I have a communicate
was senator Cornyn Hemphill
I think she had a bill that was
introduced last year that
really didn't make it very far
this was a presentation we
made to the
and term task force that they had
around role
economic and so
so that was initiative I think
her ultimate goal this year
is to continue that initiative
to actually
move forward a bill
from what I'm told
from the senator is that she
wants to request
100000000 to that
fund I can
also say that in my
discussions with the local
government division
director
he is looking at setting aside
approximately 20000000
to be able to deal
with all the specific emergencies
that they're being called upon
all the time right
and so so that's
that's one of the things so one of
the conversations I've had
what with the senator
and with Wesley
at local government division is about
how we come together
to figure out how we do this
collaborative Lee so
that as we prepare for the session
that we can figure how we
do this to be able to gain the
momentum to really look
at how we can do projects and
a very effective efficient
and effective manner
in a timely manner
because all the emergency
that I'm dealing with it's 2 years
down the road a cost
the entities so much money just
to be able to band
either for for for
awhile that they lose
all the reserve money they
don't have any more debt
capacity and so we
continues to those problems and
instead of trying to
alleviate the situation and.
Over 4 we're
losing the momentum so
that's that's the ultimate
goal in and when I think
about crisis it's more
about all the other things it's
not just water it's
it's it's flooding
all these emergencies that
I'm in cost from fires
you name it I think we've we've
been through it as a state
so we need to be open minded
but what that definition of
crisis means
thank you madam chair I think this is
probably one of the most important
things that we're going to be looking at we
need to really focus in
on I was just watching
to.
I believe is as.
NBC
morning show where they were
reporting are insurance
companies are no longer going to be
able to.
Be able to cover for
have coverage for the
these effects for these to
emergency.
This is that we're having a episodes
big events that
we're having and we're just going to have
more and its due to climate change
students which is mentioned
are flooding or fires and everything like
that and so I wouldn't
you know I would for that I'd
like to further this conversation
with you and really
emphasizes that
this is something we are really going to have
to focus on and how
we create a
fund whatever that fund is
going to look like so that it is going
to be able
to.
Continue to regenerate
itself so to speak as
we've done with other funds because this
is something that is not going away
we know we are going to be encountering
that and as we had the fires
here in southern New Mexico
and the northern New Mexico out
of the biggest fires we've ever
had on record
to date I think that we are
we really need to come together for the
north and south as
you know I'm in central north central
part of the state and
these are the we really have to bring
our community communities together
and I know Priscilla the
that is what you do best
and especially in our rural communities
who were hit the hardest
and will continue to be hit the
hardest when we look down
the road it's not a question of
you this this is going to happen
it's going to happen and we're in
the probably
billions and billions of
dollars and $100000000
I don't think it's going to be enough so thank
you I look for for the conversation
thank you madam chair Madam chair
representative Lujan one thing I
want to make sure
that we understand
is the challenges that rural
communities face is
that every time they try to seek
grant funding there's a
long component and I can tell
you many of these most
rural
municipalities
rural counties are
getting to the point where they're maxed out
in their debt in
just trying to alleviate so
they have to take
federal sources they have to
take whatever sources they can
to levy the
situation because
the some of the federal sources
are saying you have to be
non compliant
first.
Before they can get the money and
I there's something wrong with that for
me we should be prevented
to be preventing
the issue before we have
to get to that point
so I think we have
some some challenges and
be cognizant that
that we have to keep
in mind that there maxed out on
their on their debt
and that we
very few can really meet the match
requirement especially
with all the other funding that's
available as
well think thank that LESC the
committee really appreciate
that thank you thank you so
much Senator Griggs and then
Representative Jones and
representative Duncan
if we can be aware of the time that we're
going to try to get out here just because we've got
a a still a tight schedule
later this evening
madam chair I will certainly side
try to be brief except by
golly you gave me so much to
work with.
Hold remotely.
One of the one
of the challenges and and I think that
one of them but you guys have
highlighted a
lot of the challenges it
rural New Mexico in
some some ways New
Mexico faced
of the weird
let's talk about this
talk about rural health care
in fact it you
know. You can't
keep doctors
can't get doctors
why is that.
There's reasons
there's reasons and all of us up
here know what they are
we had an issue that dealt
with malpractices last
year we worked on it a
little bit we help some
we didn't help to doctors and
hospitals.
But you guys don't have a hospital
in some of the places I made
show that not hardly an
issue
but.
How do we help take care
you.
When we can't bring
doctors here
because of the malpractice
issue. You're one
of the bigger things that I've been
talked about the whole time
I've been in the legislature's
need for tort
reform to help
bring medical professionals
to our state
we're gonna have to because
we see it.
We we.
We talk about things
and we get up in Santa Fe we're
kinda removed.
Here it is they're
looking at all of this you're looking
at is right in the face telling
us what the issues
are and we
go back up there and we
nor.
We have to do
better.
They're talking about water issues
water and sewer
issues.
The first thing one of the first things I
talked about earlier in
this meeting was the water
project
I.
That's
why.
Issues with economic development
turnaround often time on
local workforce.
If you don't have it.
They don't show
up.
So if they don't show up and they
have to bring workforce
in. You
guys need to work on will how
do I a.
How do I make damning how do I make
sure over city the place
they want to
bring people
in and people want to be
there.
We've touched on a couple of things
that we why people want to be
there they want to be
there because health care is
good. They
will be there because our schools are
good they want to be there
because yours recreational
facilities are plenty
water that's why they
want that's why they come that some
of the struggles
that you guys are gonna have dimming
has some of the best water in New
Mexico
and has
forever.
And so it's it's there
it's available if we can
take if we get access and
utilized.
You know there's opportunities for geo
thermal
and I think it's in
Luna county maybe in Hidalgo
county but there's
opportunities for
that. But I
don't have any jobs ultimately
that creates and and
whatever but it's an opportunity
Hey can help you guys
grow.
Madam chair I think we've all
been
to
the
truck center or proposed
trucks center up
in Gallup.
And that's about the same
distance from Los
Angeles as
damning as.
And so
damning large
bird maybe
that a project
or some sort of project that
you all could look into
and maybe we could have one on the
north side and
one on the south
side.
Because that's a beneficial
and that's a that's a big deal
big deal for Gallup and could
be a big deal for
you guys
have broadband
we certainly needed statewide
we needed all sorts of
places then
the challenge comes if you've got
a New Mexico's got
it.
Why do I come to demi.
Why do I come to Silver
City you still
have to answer these other
questions that we're talking
about and that's
the staff that's going to bring those
people here to
help you. And
to help grow your community
and and bless
your heart I know what
I'm I'm from Alamogordo
I know where that where those
challenges are we're
and we're a little bit bigger.
You know I I pulled up
while we were sitting here pulled up
the gross receipts tax
rate. In
in y'all's communities.
And the don't Silvercity
to 8.one large
burgers 7.5
and and dimming H. 8
a quarter.
In Hobbs H.
6.5.
Why is that.
Because of the because the industry
that you hop
indication that
industry brings people
in money and staff
to that part of the world and they can
keep their taxes low because
that. And what
is taxes are the same way I'm
I'm I'm not trying to
to be critical of the
all. Those
are the things that are making it
difficult.
And we've got
control over some
of. And we can
help you if we
can get the legislature you
92 to
do that I wanted to to
point out one quick thing
here.
And this is just
a. This is kind
of a pet peeve of mine
and has been for
for years dealing with
affordable housing
for dealing
with
the housing that Jimmy Carter
used to build and and
staff and they
you know they they come in in the and they
build houses and I want you all
look at this picture.
As a great picture looks like there's
some some beach
staff.
There's truck parked on the side of
the
house.
You guys it's
because we don't we
don't bill these
things in a way
that people
live.
You know the.
That that helps you if you could
have an 18 foot
garage door
and you could make it where people would
have the opportunity to put both
cars on the
drive way
or or
in the garage not in
the yard not in the
street.
Because what that's going to do that
development at some point
it's going to make it look like a
gecko.
Over time when things
grow up in
in this house
these people live there
they don't
have kids or
teenagers and which card
will be.
We we don't look down the
road and we don't look for things
it that help
these people
and can help them be
proud of the
place they have that
they live and it's
just yeah we're trying to cut
costs we're trying to do
something.
But all in all we need to look a
little bit down the
road sure
these people
are excited about be
in there 10
years from now.
Not just today.
So you guys I want you to keep up the
good fight I think you're probably
doing good I want you to
remember one place in the
world.
Initialize Vegas
Nevada.
Las Vegas Nevada started
as nothing.
There's nothing at all
can you see what it is today
so there's hope for all
of it if we can just find
the right.
Driver to make
that happen and I
know.
You guys got the
ambition to get that done
and so I'm I'm certainly
hopeful I'm hopeful that
we can help you in some ways
it need to be you need to be
helped all in and
of by the way one mentioned
a senator percenter
Representative Lujan talked about
that Senator ratio in the
gross receipts tax it didn't
exist down there could is not
incorporated.
That is not gonna be
incorporated.
Because you know no
retail businesses in the retail
businesses are what drives
communities.
And city government is
funded almost
solely on
gross receipts taxes
if you're living in Santa Theresa
and you feel comfortable enough with
police and
fire why do you
want.
To be incorporated.
Thank you madam chair thank you
get thanks Senator
Griggs Representative
Johnson representative Duncan will
finish off.
Thank you madam chair.
And thank you presenters
Emily Christie and
Cassie
Priscilla
Jackie
I just want to say
publicly
this is this is a good
example of what I get excited
about my district
because these people right here
have the energy
enthusiasm
wisdom
and dedication to really make
things happen in our district
and that we have so
much potential
it is just incredible
how many how many things we could do
if we just have
just get over that hump
we can become not someone
who's always got our handout
but a
real
valuable
area of
of the New Mexico and
even the country and so
I'm I'm just really excited
I appreciate your
comprehensive list
of our needs and
along with the solutions
tactics and so forth
that's going to be handy for me to have
and just like check them off
you know but
one thing we did talk about and
Senator him I just wanna say I really
appreciate the conversations we had
yesterday about
how you you plan to
really invest in in our
communities as well because we're
neighbors
but
but one of the things I think is
that we've done that's been noted
already is the co starters
and Leanne Kristi and I've worked
on but we have
addressed entrepreneurship
at every level and every
age
in.
We have a there's a a national
program called lemonade day
its use
entrepreneurship
and that there are only
2 towns in
New Mexico I believe that
have at an established
program that's Albuquerque and
Deming for 2 years
now we've done that program
it is amazing
what we've done with children
to expanded
their their knowledge
and and their
maybe hope of of having
a productive future
and and that
that is something I really invested
I I I gave my junior
money to that and we're planning on
expanding that integrate Canty
and in Hidalgo county
as well so
I think it's the kind of thing that
really changes communities
and and it it
won't take long some of those
kids in 5
years they'll be adults
and they'll be starting their
own businesses and and it's
exciting so that's
just one of the things I wanted to
highlight but
thank you so much everyone if
you for for all that you do for
us it's.
It's exciting so I'll be here
I'll be your advocate I'm
excited about working with each one
of you and let's
just keep it
up thank you very much thank
you madam chair thank
you Representative Johnson
and at you know recognizing
entrepreneurship in our youth is
so important we have a program
in Los crucis that's
actually through community action agency
it's called the kids can youth
entrepreneurship program and so
they partner and they sell at the farmers
market so it's a very
similar thing and that might be something
also to look at is the kids
can youth entrepreneurship
program and
madam chair members the committee if I may
so we partner with arrowhead
center to do the account
and of ensuring we have
some members in the audience here that
have been huge supporters of that and
I just want to I know I'm standing between
you and and beer this
time and that's alright
but am we had a
student that did this program
whenever we first did our first year
about 6 years
ago
she kept up with her business that
she started in this one week camp
she is now selling her
product internationally
and it's amazing I mean
it's it's awesome to see
this support that
we have capital powers one
of those huge investors and
that that project and we're
just we really believe
in entrepreneurship at all levels
in the community so thank you for those
remarks that gives me chills I
love that that's that's fantastic
representative Duncan you're gonna finish off
today. Thank you madam
chair as a state
representative I'm grateful
to come into your community and see what
you're doing. As
a more a my little
community in my town
I love what Silvercity
stone.
My 8 community never had a
park that was
the first thing I did is more
is I made
part
and I'll say this for all the great
people in the room I
said I don't care about you
guys you could have done this 0
years go to didn't.
If we ever want our kids to come
back we gotta give a
place that they remember and
and have fond memories of
growing up so I applaud
that I would love to have a
rail and Anna Interstate
going through my community man
oh man.
Whatever we can do
please don't hesitate to reach
out to Representative
Jones.
You just elevating your role
Representative and and
in this.
You're such a clever clever
by Representative back
in.
That you know I think it's it's
I'm so grateful that all of you were
able to come and talk with us
today because I
think you've gained a
number of other cheerleaders often
when we're trying to create
policy and law that affects
communities something that
I think is really important for all of
us to have stories to
tell and to be
able to share those success
stories and to share
what communities are doing
that are really uplifting them
that sometimes they just get
overlooked you know and
it's not it's it's not a
good feeling
I can guarantee you that it's
it's typically not
intentional
but I think it's important to have
those seats at the table so that
you can share your
stories
so you know I I
do I take great pride
in that all of our presenters today have
been very strong powerful
impactful women
so thank you for what you're
doing
we do have a
tour coming up
at little toad creek
brewery and distillery but that will
take place at about 430 we do
have some public comment

of a time crunch.
You're good to go.
Thank you madam chairman
Representative
congressman yes
we do have
a 24 hour port
of entry but it does us
no good when
the port of entry truck
crossing is only open
from 4:00 to
9:00
45 I'm
sorry from 9:00 in the
morning to 4:00
in the afternoon or
sensitive This Is
open
6:00 in the morning
to 8:00 at night
and so that doesn't allow
a lot of truck crossing
and at the port of Columbus
I am asking
the legislation
to please our
legislators to please
press or
congressman
and Washington
to press the Feds
to open up our
port of
more hours so that we can get
more truck crossing
remember.
Columbus is at a
strategic point
of entrance
our state fair and
because of that
we whatever
happens in Columbus is not
only good for Columbus
but it's good for the county
is good for the region and it's
good for the state
so we get more truck
crossing it'll be good for
the state
our our
industrial park is
growing we need
natural gas
to be it to be
brought in with their cell line
already going from Deming
how to that this through that
press 7 minus road
to a border patrol
point out there but then it
stops it could
continue out to highway
11 and go out
to the LG important
and now to the industrial
park that would help
our industry also
tourism we are great
on tourism we
have international
relationships all
the way up to the federal
government New Mexico
so please come down to
Columbus
remember we are the
head not the
tail.
Thank you more appreciate
that that's a great way to
end is that it
is perfect
you're perfect.
Thank you so much we
have
timber
Rosenberg.
Hello madam chair thank you
for allowing me to make some
comments I'm gonna be very
quick first of all I'm gonna say I
also live in Columbus
and it's a great place to be and
I recommend you all get down
there and thank you
so much to Representative
Jones for her
generous help with our
food distribution
she's down there volunteering
with us and she also got us a
grant to help with that and we're
working with Luna County on
that. But I'm here
today representing broadband
as you heard Krystian
mentioned a little earlier
I am now
working as of 2
weeks ago I started working
with resound that works
we have more than
$55000000
to spend in the state
of New Mexico
and it these are funds
that we must spend
they are
designated areas
within an art off
our off grant
so I have 18
counties that I am
actively contacting
and building relationships
with just
because I have that list
doesn't mean that I'm not open to
talking to other
counties
and other.
Regions especially
since we are required
to build this we're obligated
to build these
increase broadband
infrastructure
systems so
if we are adjacent
to any other
communities we're always
happy to expand that out
and so we'd really like
to make
sure that we're building those
relationships simply so
that we can speed this process and
get you broadband infrastructure
as quickly as possible
Representative thank you and you have cards
because I've got our car has
its. I
I have actually gone through a lot of my
cards today already so if
I don't get a card
to you personally then
I I will get your
card and respond
to you very quickly thank you
Tim appreciate that the
vice chair guy goes and I
already like yeah we're
going to get on that

and lastly Avery
Marshall who was a brand new member
to the state of New Mexico
from Arizona state re you've got
2
minutes.
So as I'm
late to this conversation that
everybody's been having I wasn't study
for a second but
I heard the water issue that was being
talked about and it reminded
me of something that I've learned in my life
school classes so
in the state of New Mexico
ranchers and people who
own a large amount of acreage they
have the opportunity to get
$3000 to
$5000 to make solar
pumps and those
solar pumps can be put on top
of their property a lot of
people don't actually use
this thing it's not very well
talked about about the solar
pumps and from what
I'm aware of is that
I believe it's communities out
in Clifton Baird
I'm not too sure but some local
towns don't have the greatest like
access to water and
this program is only available
for ranchers I was
wondering if that program could be
possibly made more
accessible to neighborhoods
who could possibly use that
water because the
money's there it's not
being used.
Every do you know what the name of the program
is I'm not fully aware
but our electoral teacher talks
about all the time it only takes
$1800
to install a solar
pump given
a little extra funding such as
5000 to it
or 2000 on top
of you could then
install that into a small
neighborhood allowing them to
gain better water
it would no longer pull electricity
from your power plants and things
like that it be self sufficient
and very clean water for community
that doesn't have it.
You mind finding that information out
from your your
tier.
Texted it to me I have
your card so yes New yeah
and then we'll we'll share it because I
think that would be
representative Duncan
Madam so
is it assuming that they already have
a wells dog
or they don't
they don't have a well dug or anything
like that the the money
is all going towards
digging that digging the
well installing the
well and then
installing the solar
panels
key equipment for it it
only takes $1800
I said before it's about 3
solar panels and then the pump
itself that goes
underground
so.
It's not that hard to install
it's quick it's easy given
some extra funding a neighborhood
with a and away
our housing
association if they
were to sign off on it a housing
association signs off on
it they discuss it with the
community and then they would
be able to install it
somewhere.
That's fantastic I think
you know seen representative
Duncan kind of set up right I
mean there are many of us would be able to
do it so if you can get that
information to me then I'll get it to
Erin initial send that out because I would
love to be able to share that with
especially many of our committee members
who have rural communities
and like access to water
and pumps
that's it's it's a big program
over in Arizona already
advertised in commercials
