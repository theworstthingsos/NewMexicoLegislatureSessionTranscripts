Right.
Good
Thursday morning
everybody.
Welcome to the fifth meeting of the economic
and rural development policy committee
and senator Kerry Hamblen honored
to be serving as chair of the committee this
year also very excited to
have state representative during guy
goes also from southern New
Mexico serving as vice
chair today our topics
will include an update from workforce
solutions so we have the secretary
here Rick side about that
presentation on paid family and
medical leave understanding how
outdoor recreation is thriving
in Los Alamos and
hearing more about food insecurity
throughout the state and
tomorrow we finish off our meeting
in Santa Fe in the Senate chambers
will we will have our much anticipated
public banking panel
and they hear about legislation
up for endorsement from
for this committee and then we will
adjourn for the
year.
Let that set in
yes. This is our
last meetings the last
series of meetings and we'll
finish up with public comment if we have
any before we recess or adjourn
for those of us watching on the webcast
thank you very much we appreciate you
to in
as for committee members just a
reminder you'll have been
absolutely fantastic
about recognizing that
the folks that are presenting to us today
or hear it on their
own time so that
and our at our request
and so we want to be respectful of their
time and keep our questions
to the topic at hand but
we've had a lot of questions that have popped
up that Aaron will always follow
through with our guests
and our presenters from the
committee so if there are
questions that we cannot get
to just because of time
Erin will follow up with our
folks and get those answers to
you I will
do my best to keep us on track
and on time if it does look like a
discussion is going off topic
I will certainly bring it back it's not
meant as a means of censoring any of
you which is trying to be respectful of the
time that you've committed
to today as well as to
what our speakers are and lastly
I'm always so excited and
appreciative of the
conversations and the questions
that happen as a result of these
committee members and I'm I'm grateful
for your commitment to the state of New
Mexico.
And so now we're going to have
we will start off
with a
update from Steven Lynn
who is the county manager of Los
Alamos County
giving us a lovely warm welcome
thank you to having us
here in the council
chambers here in the town
of Los Alamos
and we're very grateful
Stephen thank you so much for being
here today we appreciate it
I know that you just press the little talkie
person there on the amendment
my and probably
point the microphone a little bit
there you go you're you're
good to go Sir thank you for being
here.
All thank you all
for being here good morning
everyone it's
a little strange sitting on this side
I'm used to being in this chambers
but not necessarily in this
setting
chair Hamlin vice chair day goes
senators and representatives
it's very much my pleasure to welcome
you here to Los Alamos
I am Steven went on the county
manager
here.
Definitely at an honor
for us to be able to host
you also
really want to thank you for the work
that you do on
behalf of the state.
Is probably something that you hear a lot
as you go from place to place
so I really wanted to start off
and share a few comments
about. What's
behind my appreciation of
what you all do.
I've worked in Los Alamos for over
27 years and
worked in around local government
for over 30 years
I'm I've only recently had this
position as county manager just
the past 2 years.
But every other Monday I
get the pleasure of greeting our new
employees
it's a large group sometimes in this
room.
And one of the things 2
of the things that we stress
our customer
service and
teamwork.
And when I look
at this room that's
part of what I see
if you all
investing your time to travel
around the
state.
And serve the people
you're elected to serve
and doing it together as a
team.
It's something I very much
appreciate of the other
thing that I've I've come
to appreciate.
Over my career.
Is the notion of good
governance and the
fact that good governance
requires well
informed elected
officials and that's
the other thing I appreciate about you
all being here and really
this process you go through through
the interim committee
process
the fact that you're all
engaging to become better
informed and
therefore improving the services you
provide for all of us.
Really that's what it means to me
and for that I want to say thank you
thank you for being
here
and so in that spirit of
of being
well informed and better
informed I hope
with the few other comments
it'll make sure to share a
few few facts a few
tidbits about Los Alamos
and hopefully a few of those comments
will be some new things you haven't
heard
before.
This month we've noticed on your
agenda quite
a variety and and diverse
number of
topics.
Including things as
diverse as cannabis
industry as well as the film
industry.
It may surprise you given that
most of the employment here in Los Alamos
is federally
driven that of
directly to cannabis
retailers here in Los
Alamos.
Most people aren't aware of
that.
I'm also most people around the state
when they think about
unemployment in the economy
Los Alamos the naturally just
think of the lab
but there are other aspects of our economy
that are evolving
such as tourism and the
film
industry.
We had a.
Little film came out
over the summer.
Including some very significant
scenes in that movie they were filmed
in fuller
lodge you
one of the.
Parts of Los
Alamos.
I'm gonna presume some of you've heard
about that
that film
Oppenheimer
yes.
It's a we we
actually don't have
numbers yet but
some some reports have
indicated that tourism
visits over the over the
past couple months of increased 60
percent over the prior
year. A
portion that might be some
comment recovery but
certainly we're providing a lot of that
to the to the film.
And the impact
just doesn't escape us
and it really
we're we're grateful
that.
That it's out there and and
that the histories is
now.
More this for others to see
from from a totally different
perspective.
In fact many New Mexicans
because that movie are
probably more aware of the history of
Los Alamos and.
Than we've seen in the
past.
It was really not that long
ago that Los
Alamos.
Really became its own
local government
moves a couple decades past
the Manhattan Project that that
occurred we aren't
the newest county in the state
there's actually one newer than
us
took me awhile to figure that out I always
thought that we were the newest but we're
not.
And in many
ways we're a lot
like. All
the other local governments in the
state I'm one of
the main differences for us is that we
are combined city
county.
I think it's a the.
Great arrangement for us
the the efficiencies associate with
a single entity
or really
helpful.
I'm.
So we have all the responsibilities
of both the city and
county.
We also some very significant
responsibilities
providing services to the
lap such as our fire
department utilities
department.
Which are both
much much larger than you'd see
in a community this
size
that just you know 80 percent
of the electricity that we
produce is
for the
laboratory.
It's both being a combined city
county as
well as those significant
larger departments so we
have
that make our budget C.
March.
So so those factors that
make. A
pretty difficult and complex
to compare and benchmark
Los Alamos data against
other local
governments.
It's something that.
Comes up from time to time and we
deal with over the
years.
And always creates a
challenge.
I'm all Los Alamos is
often recognized as a
one company town
many people don't actually
realize how extreme
and severe that is
we all kind of.
Know what
but I want to share a couple facts related
to that.
Several years ago we had an economic
study done.
And the results of that study
concluded that 97
percent of our local
economy.
These either directly or
indirectly a
result of the
lab.
95 percent of the
household within the county have
at least one family
member working at the
lab.
So what we see
this notion
of of.
One company town and an
impact of industry
different places even at the state
level.
It's fairly
unusual have concentrated
is here in Los
Alamos.
You know the notion of the boom and bust
that some recognize at
the state level associated with the
oil and gas industry a
similar.
But again just much more concentrated
here.
And like oil and gas
for the state it can be a bit
of a roller coaster as those
revenues go up.
And then as they go
down.
You know today both
for the state of oil and gas revenues
are up in a for us
locally G. R. T.
revenues are
up.
One of the things that I
just. No
is that eventually they'll go
down.
And there's also the
environmental downside
so you know there's always the benefit
and there's always a cost
and again here
in Los Alamos which is a lot more
concentrated with some of the
hazardous and radiological
legacy waste
associated with the Manhattan
Project and and the operations
in
town.
Our county government has a similar
tax structure to
other counties and cities in the
state.
And like many other communities we
suffered a fair bit
of business lost during the
pandemic.
Workers staying at home
certainly restaurants and
retailers closed
CB fox one of our main
retailers right
right now the part of
downtown
closed its
doors.
Definitely having a
pretty.
Big negative impact
on what retail shopping
would be available.
Even prior to that
you one of the issues that Los Alamos
has always dealt with
is not
enough retail it's something
we've been working towards
improving.
Certainly the expand
its agency market place has
helped
but even today there
still.
Of.
Quite a bit of retail
shopping that occurs off the
hill.
And folks talk about
you know comparing what they got at Walmart
for 6 whole foods
it's just.
Always been a chronic issue here in
Los Alamos and something we continue
to to work towards
is improving the retail environment
here.
With a population of just
shy of
20000
we lacked medical providers
teachers
housing
like a lot of other communities
in the state
these are issues when we get
together with our peers across
the state just a
lot of the same common
issues that we're dealing
with.
Some of that may not sound all
rosy
so don't be too
concerned although I'll share some of
the.
Happier stuff that's occurring as
well and and
give a little more of a balanced look at Los
Alamos is a community
and also share a little bit of
what we're doing with our regional
partners
late I for now I'm gonna leave
it outdoor items an outdoor
recreation I know
that's a topic in the
afternoon.
Plenty of gorgeous scenery right
in here in Los Alamos
another thing that we share in common with
a lot of our
neighbors.
Our deputy county manager
and the branch will be speaking to
the later today and ensuring
about
that.
Part of the history here in Los
Alamos
that some some folks are
aware of that
prior to 2007
Los Alamos.
Received much
much less gross receipts
tax many people think we receive
non because
the university of California who
operated the lab for
the first 40 years of existence
was nonprofit we didn't
receive 0 but it
was about 30 percent of what
we would normally receive
because of the G. R.
T. laws so
for that first 40
years.
We as a committee really didn't
have normal revenues
to
operate.
A lot of our budget was focused
on just barebone
items.
And it's not very
much invested in our
infrastructure.
And it was really
just.
Us as a community trying to
get on our feet
and fill some basic
rules and and provide basic
amenities to support
the lab and the
community.
From
Bernalillo we're
fortunate we have some very
determined
citizens and entrepreneurs
in the community back
in 1983 they start at
the.
Los Alamos back then
was the EDC
economic development corporation
today it's Los Alamos commerce
and development corporation
there's a group that's sponsoring your lunch by
the way there are nonprofit
organization that includes
our chamber of commerce
and they support a lot
of the retail.
And other small businesses within
the community as
well as technology and
research spin offs from the
lab
they've. For
all that time in a partner
to the
county.
And we certainly know having an
active partner in the
community is critical
and and vital to our
success.
After 2007 once
our gross receipts tax was
normalized we
could finally start investing in our
infrastructure.
And the other thing we did was
recognize the importance
and and started investments going to
food significantly
with partners throughout the
region.
As well as our
schools.
In 2009 we
started talking with our
neighbors
about.
The regional transportation
system the
regional economic development
and about regional
broadband.
All of this is under the umbrella of
a program we started called
progress you
partnering.
This helped lead to the creation
of the north central regional transit
district which is now
a very successful
entity all on its
own
reading at which is
a.
Regional.
Broadband.
Backbone.
From northern New Mexico
as well as the regional economic
development
plan.
You know I I talked earlier about
us being a a one company
town.
And some of the ups and downs
of
revenue.
Well revenues are up
now and they went up
quite a bit in
2007
when the
lab contractor turnover.
I've heard of.
It wasn't that long after that that we
had one of those significant
decreases
over a 2 year
period
from 2012
to 14 a revenue shrunk
30
percent.
So again it's just part part
of the risk side of the benefit
risk equation of having
very significant
single employer in
town our
workforce decreased it was
definitely a hard lesson for
us but
we were somewhat prepared for
it and
fortunately we didn't have to
just totally disengaged with our
neighbors we continued with our regional
partnership
programs.
And made sure they
continued.
I know all across New Mexico
we're working to diversify their
economies certainly for
us
lack of diversity is always been a
major issue
I always say we will never be
diverse.
Because of how large the lab
is but to the extent
that we can be even a little bit
more diverse it
benefits us and that's always
been a
goal.
You know a large part of
our efforts in a large part of our
strategy though we're still focused
on.
Supporting lab as a major
wealth provider not just for Los
Alamos but also for the
region.
Some of our recent activities
include a supporting
more housing.
Very big
issue.
Including for the just
first time recently the of
the possibility and
availability of low income
housing and low income senior
housing.
And we continue to work on ways
to diversify and improve
our housing stock
we recently updated our building
code to allow for greater
densities in our downtown that's
just one example.
We've also reached out to
our
neighbors in Espanola
and trying to help
them on plans increase
housing stock down
there we've
just recently
initiated a
regional effort
through the communities
of excellence program
with both rear Reba
Santa Fe County and the 8
more than pueblos to work on
workforce development
that's one of the most common things that
we here's how difficult it is
to get employees
and we just are
determined to find
new alternatives.
To help again not
without not just Los Alamos
but but the whole region
we've recently signed to economic
development and will use
with both Santa Fe County in
Rio Arriba county
that that last was just approved
by our council this week
we're also working on regional broadband
initiatives.
Will serve to and will use
under progress you partnering
program most
recently with the city of Espanola
and ripple Rio
Arriba.
Of supporting
projects such as
a.
Elderly care facility
in Rio Arriba county as
well as assistance for the north
central solid waste
authority.
Counties really trying to capitalize
on the benefits of increased
revenues while they are
here
and we're also trying to at the same
time recognize the risk
of a future declines
you at any time Congress
can. Choose
to change the programming at the
lab and shift resources
elsewhere we've seen it occur in other
communities
we recently had a pyrrhic change
with folks
from Savannah River
here.
So that's always a risk
we've seen it happen before
again we know they'll be some increases
and the decreases in the
future.
So we just continue
to maintain our focus on both
supporting the lab in the
region
and continue to look
for new business opportunities
into economic new economic
development opportunities
we're definitely looking forward to this next
next legislative
session
seeing how all of your work
provides catalyst for these new
opportunities
both across the state and again
hopefully here in Los Alamos and
where the New Mexico.
We just want to thank you again for
allowing us to host
really appreciate you being
here.
I'm certainly ready to answer
any questions if you have
any
and madam chair and
committee members I hope you enjoy
your time here in Los
Alamos.
Thank you so much Mr
Lynn and and as somebody who
grew up in a community
in Texas
in el Paso we were always very
concerned about whether or not
the base would stay open or closed
and so
I might my
my anxiety is with
you on that
because you never know and
especially it's a community that
so dependent on it that really
is built around it
you know I appreciate your efforts
of of thinking about your
your plan be
here I do have Senator
Rodriguez would like to ask a question and
Representative in yes
thank you madam chairman just
briefly good morning Steven
good to see you again
I just wanted to to
know what is your
gross receipts at
this point now here in Los
Alamos you mentioned that
for 40 years she received 30
percent approximately gross
receipts tax how much does
was almost get at this
point.
Senator madam chair committee
members.
In.
At the end of fiscal year
23 are
gross receipts tax revenues
county wide in total were
approximately
95000000.
Are it is so
that's a I
can't visualize
what the 30 percent representative
before but
hopefully it's quite a bit
of a of a change
and improvement.
At.
When I started here at the county
I started as budget
officer
and our gross receipts
tax revenues were under
20000000
by well
okay all
right well I'm just
now I'm going
to echo the
comments that are chair
Senator Hamblen said
you know that we're happy you're looking
for other opportunities
it's great to continue to support
the labs and and so
on but we just never know
this is been said before
so it's good to
see you're being proactive
and we're so appreciative
of the laps and in Los
Alamos also and
Representative back Christine
Chandler out there sitting in
the audience were discovery
grateful for her and happy to work
with her also as she continues
to work towards this and the many
other legislators
helping so thank you very much thank
you madam chairman thank you
Senator Rodriguez representative
Duncan and then vice chair
guy thank you madam
chair
boys as the mayor of a
small town I
am so jealous
your G. R. T. my
heavens
I I'm power plant guy
so when you talk about
producing that can you tell me
what source and how much
you do
produce.
Representative on just clarify are
you talk about electric
production. Yes
right to look at madam chair when
you when you talk about producing
electricity for
for the lab so
I was just
curious.
Representative so it what
one of the peculiarities
of the way we're structured is
that the utilities department
is the one function that doesn't report
to me. I do
sit as ex officio on the
utility for those so I will
I am slightly familiar
so I'm going
to.
There's a way of disclaiming please take
my answer with a grain of salt
all of all wing is here
our utilities manager
would be much more precise
but I think our our total
production is in the neighborhood
of I'm gonna say 0
megawatts
the portfolio is fairly
diverse we
have.
Well recently
had. The
of a share in the San Juan
plant.
That just closed
we've
replaced that with
a of
15 megawatt power
on a purchase power agreement with
Uniper which
is.
Wind and solar and
backed up with some gas
we have.
Are hydro production
facilities Abbey Q.
and a Lotto.
We have.
Power purchase agreement and
Laramie
river.
We we have
a. I
shared electric
production.
Agreement.
With the laboratory so
there we pool our
production
resources
they have a share of lop
of allocation
from the
feds.
And one of things I found the most
interesting
is just our efforts
through you Ms you
Utah
municipal power
association
we're considering
investing in of
a new
nuclear facility
up in Idaho.
That one 's quite a ways off
and and we have gone to
the point of full commitment but
that's a call in the
exploratory stages does
that help
if thank you thank you madam
chair yes Sir that that
answer my question because I I
assume that source has to be
solid rock
solid you can
have a brown outs blackouts
and and so I was just wondering
how and and
and what extent your and the
laptop also has a gas
turbine
facilities will.
Thank you madam chair interesting
thank you Representative I sure gave
us. Thank
you madam chair and and
thank you Mr live here your
words state thank you for hosting
us I I
don't really have a question I just wanted
to let you know that I
graduated high school
from Los Alamos
and just coming up here in
just seen the
beautification all the new
buildings
just you know and it wasn't that
long that I graduated but
you know. Just to
see the
just how much this the
discount has grown
is really nice and I
think that you know
use the city manager and your
leadership
really is is shining
through so just wanted to
make comment on that it and thank
you again for hosting us
thank you.
Any other questions.
Yes Senator
Stefanics thank you
madam chair sorry I'm
late I used to
represent parts of Los
Alamos and all white
rock back in the
nineties and it
has shockingly
changed it's very
modern this facility
I did many debates
down in fuller
lodge and
the. Thank
the community has really
blossomed thank you very
much.
Thank you so much I do feel like we're in
parliament.
We have a 2
years

hospitality and and
for also arranging so that the
drive up was absolutely gorgeous
because the colors changes are
just stunning.
I'm glad you could be enjoying a
lovely morning thank you
here thank you so much
already we've got our
our next featured speaker
she'll be spending the entire morning
with us.
And very excited about
that we have the
secretary of workforce
solutions
Siri denier and
she will be giving us an update
on the department
and then
as close to 1115 as
possible then we will start our
discussion on paid family and medical
leave and she'll be joined
by Tracy McDaniel
Representative Chandler and I
believe Representative Serrato
so thank you for being
here it's lovely seeing you.
Very excited about this
and and
we'll turn it over to
you.
Has at Fishel this
way.
The talking person I knew what you
meant good
morning at chair him live in
person the committee it's great to be
here with you today
I want to start a Chris by thanking
my staff is always
who gets me prepared
for these hearings and also for thinking
your exceptional staff person
is fine too it
was a great communicator to
us getting prepped so
this slide deck is all in response
to the questions we received happy
to jump around answer
questions in the middle just let me know
what you need.
So it's starting with the big
picture slide to
at August twenty twenty
three unemployment was at
3.7 percent and
we are up 16000
600 jobs over the
year I know that is
a little higher unemployment than we
saw earlier in the year but
when you look at that together with
the number of jobs the
overall picture is more people
entering the labor force
and that's a good thing so we have
more people looking for
work who were
previously just sitting on the bench
so we're happy with those
numbers and that we're right here
in the middle of our regional
comparison.
Moving on to slide
3 labor force
participation has been a
conversation the legislature for
number of years but
just as a reminder that
is you take the number
of people who are have a job
in the number of people who
don't have a job but are looking
and then that's that the top
number and you divide that by the
overall population 16
to 65 non
institutionalized in New Mexico
and you get the labor force participation
rate and historically New
Mexico's has always been
lower than the national average
and it continues to be in the
bottom 5 for the country
however you can see the trend line
is going in the right direction
going up pretty
steadily since doctor
says August September
July of last year
I one of the questions that I
received was
how the end of the
snap
emergency
allotments which was the increased
snap benefit during the
pandemic was
affecting the labor force
participation rate the unemployment
rate I mean the answer is
there is some correlation here
between the increase in the labor force
participation rate in the changing
those benefits but
we're in the process of of sort
of digging into the data and
understanding whether there's actually
causation there or if it's
just correlation and
that the example I use is that
I started here in August 22
in the the rates gone up since
then but I don't think it's me
so I also don't think that it's
necessarily just the budget
but will be doing the research
and reporting back on that.
Moving on to slide
for just
giving you the overall picture of unemployment
claims continue to be
at a low and lower
than a pre
pandemic so were it
just a
9245
and so that means that there
are fewer people receiving
unemployment insurance benefits
now than there were
before the pandemic.
So now moving on to some of your
more
specific questions
one of them was about the
barriers to unemployment
so I'm gonna spend the next few slides
talking about that but I
wanted to sort of conceptually give
us a framework to think about
this so if you think about
this middle circle with the orange
around it those are the people who are
actually receiving unemployment
insurance benefits
and then outside of that are the people
who apply for those benefits
and don't receive them and
the next circle out are people who are
eligible for benefits
but maybe don't apply
and then outside of that of the
people who are ineligible and we
can think of each of those
as sort of a layer of
of barriers and we'll go through each
of those in turn.
Moving on so then to the next
slide at
the.
Barriers to unemployment insurance
from eligibility perspectives
of the people who are outside of
that largest circle
the main barriers their immigration
status a self
employment and
inadequate wages so you do
have to make a minimum amount of
wages to be eligible for
unemployment benefits and that's what an
adequate wages means.
And so you
know those are all part of the
law the immigration
status is part of both state and
federal law self
employment is pretty much the
rule in in all
states
and so there's
nothing different about
New Mexico when it comes to these
3 areas but there are
some things that we are trying to work
on in these areas one of
them is a study that
was funded by
a junior bill money
Representative Rubio
last year
allocated $200000
for study on benefits to
people who are currently excluded
from unemployment and we
do see other states like Colorado
who have
taken state
money and used it to provide
benefits for people
of different immigration status who are
eligible for their menu I
and we see a number of states
New York New Jersey California's
just got struck down but
a number of states who are
trying to implement
inched an insurance unemployed
insurance for gig workers
so uber drivers is really where
it started but it's
expanded from not and
so we're taking a look at some of
those populations and kind
will come back to you
probably for the
26 I
session to talk about
what we learned what that would cost
if there's any interest in
that and
then. Portable
benefits for self employed again that's
that that's that list of all the
states that are doing that for the sort of the
gig economy
people.
So moving on to the next
slide the next ring
of barriers there are barriers to
access
we've been fortunate to to do
not a lot of work we got a grant
from the US department of
labor to look at barriers
to
accessing our unemployment
insurance budget
we spent we specifically looked at
the pandemic there and
then there is
the and I I might get this
name I'm I think it's called the
union of unemployed
workers but they're
nonprofit organization that does
work all over the country and they
did just a sort of a deep dive
into the barriers to access
here in New Mexico so we have
the benefit of that learning as
well and the main
barriers that we've all identified
our number one awareness
that the program even exists in
that person might be
eligible language
access always a struggle
in the program in New Mexico
telecommunications I'm just
using as a work as a broad
word to say there are people
who don't have broadband
access in there people who have
access but don't necessarily
have the the level of digital
skill to be able to interact with
our system and the
complexity of the overall
system which again you know
every unemployment insurance
system is complex but ours
I mean I'm a lawyer and I read
the statutes and I'm like after
it 5 times to even begin to
understand what the means with
complicated
and blackouts
which is when
the account has been sort of
tagged for fraud for whatever
reason people get locked out of
their accounts both on the business side
and on the employee side
businesses usually know how to sort
of push through and and get there is
open but a lot of claimants just
give up which is
really sad and it's it's sort
of a necessary side effect of
having a robust cybersecurity
program but our
our ideas and initiatives
that are are aimed at addressing
these barriers to access
are are in the second column
there number one is the
equity grant navigator program
and we're super excited about this
program so we partnered
with the department of health and across
the state were training their community
health workers which is an existing
program and
we're training them in how to
access both unemployment
benefits and re
employment services all. The things
that we do with the department
and then they're going out to their
communities and
telling predominately
rural and and many tribal
populations about how
to access those benefits
and then we have a warm hand off to
someone who works in our office
to actually get people enrolled
because our federal laws
requires to do that
so we're excited
about the program we have
we just did our last cohort of
training out in Gallup
our first winds were
down in
Dona ana county and then we also
had one in Las Vegas
so we're starting to get them all over the state
and we are
looking forward to the first set of
data but we've already in our data
collection process become sort of a
national model for this navigator
program so we're excited about
that and that's really aimed
at those first
3 Representative for barriers
really in in
getting access we
also we're hiring more multilingual
speakers for ari unemployment
insurance call center so we've always
had Spanish language speakers
we now have to deny
speakers we
have a language access line but
now everybody's trained on it
we have a language access policy
that was updated within the last year
and so we've really been focusing on
language access as well
and then we have an in person
presence are workforce connection
center because we know in New
Mexico business is
still done relationships are still
important face to face and
so well a lot of
unemployment insurance
programs in the country are actually
contracting becoming
smaller and smaller in terms of
real person service
ours is actually getting bigger
we think that's right for the state we think
actually other states are going to move in that
direction also 23
of our 25 workforce
connection centers have been in
person you I presents
and in that includes our career
transition specialists who
are cross trained in both unemployment
and reemployment and so they
can really be that one stop shop
for clients and
then lastly our
anti fraud initiatives I think
of it sort of as a pendulum this
is to address the lockout
issue our our
filters were very sensitive
so an example is if
15 people signed up
for budget in a
smaller town likes the Alamogordo
in one day that would be flagged.
For fraud because it
was you know statistically
anomalous but then
all of those 15 accounts might be
locked down and
eventually they would be unlocked
but as I mentioned earlier
right some of those claimants might get
frustrated and just sort of give
up so we had to tune
the sensitivity the pendulum's had
to swing back a little bit towards
the middle so that our filters
are still sensitive enough to catch those
patterns of fraud but not so
sensitive that they're locking out
legitimate claimants so those
are the ways that we're trying to tackle those
barriers.
And then the last set of barriers are
sort of that inner circle why
people are getting denied
benefits and
so this chart shows
you in blue
the blue stripes are telling you the
numbers of times we've made that
determination on that it type
of issue the red stripes
are telling you the number of times that
issue was determined and
then employment unemployment
benefits were denied
and then the greenish gray
line is telling you the
percentage of determinations
that were denied and that's the the
order that they're in there.
So you'll
see that the
we make very
few miles based on
things like refusal of the status
of work is perfect
refusal of suitable work so that's
when there's a dispute
between the employer and the
employee and the
employee is saying
actually I got fired in the
employer saying actually
we tried to give you work to
do and you said no to that particular
type of work that's a refusal of
suitable work you see we don't
make a lot of those determinations
and when we do that's not often
a barrier
it in contrast
one of our most common
reasons for denial is
able and available as we call
it which is each week
the unemployment claim needs to
recertify that they are both able
and available to work
and we see a lot of
determinations and a lot of
denials in that area
because basically
if you haven't made the certification
you have to show that you you did
meet that status but that you just
forgot to file your thing and
we we do a lot of miles on
that basis so
not that we're necessarily recommending
tackling any these
barriers
but.
But we
do.
Wanted to to show you what those
look like happy to answer
questions on this but
you're telling me to go back there that's why I was
like
okay.
I'm trying this out
since we're kind of like parliament's
trying to like fill it
out at
our San Juan delegation strong
in the house today
so.
Moving on the
last slide really
on unemployment insurance
1 of the other questions we got
was what are some of our fiscal
challenges and
solvency of the an unemployed
insurance fund has as
you know always historically
been a challenge
they're only 16 states in the
country right now that our meeting
the United States department of
labor's
wrist recommendations for
solvency which is basically
like a 1.1 this
measurement of how much
you have relative to your
potential
liabilities and there
we are 1 of 15 states
that was actually meeting
that solvency guideline
before the pandemic in
2019 but has not gotten
back there yet so
the you I trust fund balances
currently about
$415000000
burned the third quarter of
2021
to the second quarter of this
year we actually
spent more than we
collected so we paid out
360 4000000 we
brought in 311000000
of contributions so what's
keeping us afloat is still the federal
money that we got
the the ramifications
of not meeting that
federal standard for solvency
is that if we were to need a
loan we would not be up eligible
for an interest free loan
which those you know the 16
states that meet that level
to meet at
but in terms of of what to
do about it and how we
got here in how we got here
is you know the
pandemic as
well as the as you all and
especially those who have been here
for a long time know that the legislature
has from time to time had to
infuse the fine with
cash but
also there was
a lot this but during the
pandemic where we
pulled out the year 2020
from the calculation of experience
history and that was
completely understandable is to
help businesses during that
time but that
look back actually we look at the
25 years
for when we are determining
part of the the right
factors and so
that that removal of that year's
going to stick with us for a long time
and we're really
not on pace to.
Cover the the
funds here and
so you
know it's a very complex formula
but I did and
we're fine
until we're not right so if there
were to be a very
dramatic recession we
would be in the position of needing to ask
for interest bearing loan from the federal
government or coming to
you for that money so
again not sounding an alarm or
anything like that but I
did want to make you aware of that like
to keep everybody informed of the status
of the trust
fund.
And then we were also
asked about fraud so
moving on to the next slide which
I see doesn't have a number of projects
for that
there's been a lot of conversation of course
about the fraud that happened during the
pandemic and everybody kind of
knows the $250000000
number but I did want to
sort of make
it
give you a little bit of a bigger picture
which is that
this chart with the
green and the red so
the red are the
claims that that
fraudulent claims that went through that
resulted in those
$250000000 of fraudulent
payments the green
are the ones that we prevented
before $1 was paid so
we actually prevented
when I say we I'm not taking
credit I wasn't there
but Under
Secretary McKinley and secretary
Sir to the prevented
81 percent of the fraudulent
claim so as bad as it
was the attempts
the attacks were much
worse
and in
terms of trying to recover
that recovery numbers
like every state in the union are are
pretty dismal to about
2.5000000
about one percent
of what was
taken we have
very limited tools to
recover that money so we've
and we've to use bank
call backs if the
scammers were sort of silly
enough to let the money sit in the
exact same bank account that it
was transferred to
then we clawed it back but
most moved it out and
moved it into crypto and moved
out of the banking system all together
right away
we also voided of course any
payments any checks and debit
cards that were issued
as payments were
voided and then there
is a little bit of court ordered
restitution but
honestly like all white
collar crime there's not a lot
of prosecution happening
in any state of the union and
we don't really have anybody
to kind of go after these folks
so I
don't I don't really see
that number changing because
Maurice is gonna tell you what's the
truth so we're
we're not burning still engaged
in cleaning up backlog and and
all that stuff from the pandemic we
more than
actively pursuing. Fraud
recovery
and we
just recently 2 days
ago I read a story
about Washington state seems
to be the only state that's actually
figured anything out in terms
of recovery in the for covered
20000000 of
1.$2000000000
of fraud that they experienced
but it was a partnership to the Attorney
General so we will be
pursuing that.
With Attorney
General Torrez
but again like us
everybody has limited resources to
pursue this ride
but we of course can work to
prevent it in the future so the next
slide as
actually drawn from my old
state auditor days the fraud
triangle is what we talk about about
what causes this type
of of fraud and crime
to existence
this combination
of motive
opportunity and rationalization
so I don't even need to explain
how the pandemic
presented that perfect storm
right there was a lot of pressure on
people economically but there's
also a ton of
money flooding the system all across
the country in
staff was overwhelmed and
fraudsters new that's of that
opportunity was there
and then it was all
kind of made me Napoli
money her kind of felt
like that at the time so I I think
we saw fraud it at levels
that we haven't seen historically because
it did feel a little
easier to rationalize in that
context so
we're initiatives to prevent
fraud include
1.$2000000 grant that we
got again from the US department of
labor for fraud detection and
prevention we
have enhanced identification
verification
authentication
the pattern recognition that I mentioned
earlier where we have
sort of very rudimentary
A. I. looking at the patterns of
claims and walking down accounts
if we see something that's
suspicious and then
our USDA I also considered
to be part of our fraud
prevention so that
is a federal program where
we identify the people who are
most likely to exhaust
their unemployment benefits or use
all 26 weeks and
then we reach out to them
specifically and we require
them to enroll in a
program to get them back to
work so that hopefully they don't
have to use all those benefits and
part of that enrollment
is mandatory in
person meetings and when you bring
people in they can't be
fraudsters anymore so I consider
that to be part of our fraud detection
protocol as well.
And the last slides
just to make you aware the newest
scam hearing across
the country is fictitious employers
and I mean you gotta hand it to these
fraudsters so they
actually create a whole
company
and file it
and then file
1012 unemployment
claims under that company
and get paid and everything
before it gets cut caught
up with them and by the time you catch up
with them you know the idea
is they be gone however is you
can see here we've
had 900
42 fictitious employers
created and we caught them
all
before any of the benefits
were paid
but in their scams they
tried to to claim
almost $20000000 a
budget
so
you know the we tried to
put on a stronger firewall
in terms of their
CRS number in the to started getting
CRS numbers for their made up
businesses I mean this
is the an industry at
this point
but we you know
knock on wood we've been doing while
detecting it but this is
the latest standards for for
your awareness.
So that's the end of unemployment
applause here if anyone has
any questions or I'll just
keep rolling.
Thank you secretary and I know
that you know through our work
plan and an error and
sending that information to you
those were the questions this
committee wanted to address
but I I know you're not
surprised if there are other questions that
are are spurred by this
and this committee is
very curious and ask a lot of
questions and it's a very engaging
conversation that we typically
have so we'll
start off with Senator
Rodriguez who got
Representative dunk in
and then Representative
little Representative
Lujan okay I'll get
to let me write
it down and
Senator Rodriguez co head start now
get me catch up with my name
is here thank you thank you madam
chairman and good morning
secretary and I are good to see
you thanks for all your work
you came in at a time when there
was so much
so much to do and not that it
ever gets any better but
still you have a lot
to catch up on and to
to make improvements on and
so on so thank you very much for
that I just have a
maybe a couple of questions
one is did I
understand correctly
when you mentioned the
barriers to eligibility
that one of them
is
where people
are required to make minimum
wage to qualify
or at least a minimum of
wages not minimum wage
to qualify for unemployment
benefits
how can a person be
required to to
have some income.
If they're good if they don't have any
job and they can they would to
qualify for that can you explain that
to me sure thank you madam
chair Madam chair Senator
Rodriguez so we
look at the first 5
quarters of the last
5 quarters
so
I'll give you an example when I finish the
the whole thing but we look at the first 4
quarters of the last 5 quarters
and in one of those quarters you have
to it maybe a minimum
amount that is adjusted
every year right now it's about
$2400 and
then in another quarter you have
to maybe $1 so
you have to have wages in 2
of those quarters
so as an example
and I have to write this simple down
selling I don't usually read but
I'm going to read this one for
you
so.
Let me get
their.
Okay so if
you lost your job on June first
twenty twenty three
we look at your earnings from
January first twenty
twenty two to
December first
December 21 first
2022 so it's the
last
last first
4 of the last 5
quarters though
June 1
for example is in
the.
Second quarter second
quarter of the year so the
5 quarters before that
started January the year
before so we're basically
looking at that whole year before
in one of those quarters you have
to it maybe the minimum amount
that we change every year which right now
is about 2400 and
then in another quarter you have to have
maybe $1.
So you don't have to make anything at the time
that you're cleaning.
I see madam
chairman but US secretary
I'm trying to visualize somebody who's
been without work for
for a while to say somebody
has been without work
for 2 years has been
applied
and
you know they just didn't make
$1 didn't make
anything what happens to those
people that can't
whether it's because of
disability or because they
couldn't they have been ill
or they don't have the means
to to apply
for whatever reason
can you tell me what happens to those
people thank you yes
madam chair as Senator
Rodriguez there is a timeliness
component to claiming unemployment
benefits so if
you don't claim them
in time to meet those
wage thresholds
in general you're barred from ever
collecting them
we do have in in
federal law really dictates a lot
of this we have some very
limited exceptions where
people have extraordinary
circumstances and literally
it's like I was in a coma since
I lost my job kind of
thing but
you will be time barred in your
example from
ever being able to go back and claim those
benefits C.
madam chairman thank you
Secretary higher let
me ask is is there an appeal process
for someone just say somebody
disabled couldn't do
it couldn't
hear other people
who have who are
deaf deaf
blind
they just don't have a way to
go or physically
disabled and couldn't do
it but then
they got somebody to help them
years couple of years after
can't and they're denied
can you there's no
exceptions for
somebody with special needs or anything
like that madam chair
Madam chair Senator Rodriguez there
is an appeal process and has
a couple of years and and
sort of the penultimate
layer before you would go to court is
is actually my review so I see
a lot of those
and again
there are circumstances
where that denial can be
reversed and you can be granted those
benefits more
common than people not getting
the claim is sometimes
they they don't
they want it back. Stated
in the
that's the I don't have
it on my chart but actually that's
the most common thing that we
deny is the backdating
claims
but so it's possible
but it's it's just not very
common the
things that we tend to reverse
on or more issues
of like I tried to go to
do it at night
miss I was locked out
of my account or
you know there was a dispute between
employer and employee about the conditions
of release for
some of these things that you see
here
but those types of
situations timeliness
are are difficult to
overcome thank
you thank you madam chairman and just
quickly and I'll defer to others
but during the
COVID pandemic
situation the
phones were it is
just I'm sure
ringing all the time but
the problem to
get a mansard was a
huge problem
and
is that changed
any are there more people
answering the phones or
do they all go into voicemail
and then people calling back or how
does that happen to me
chairman and madam chair
Senator Rodriguez at
we we have
substantially decreased
the wait times
we average about 17
minutes now the
time that you're on the phone is
is where a lot of people get a little
frustrated too because it's a long
process when you're filing a
claim so
our agents might only be
taking one or 2 calls
an hour because of the link
that that process
we do have certain times and
days too so
Monday and Tuesday
mornings are roughest
in we'll see our time our
time to wait
inching up there
they have addressed that
primarily through increased staffing
although you know like everyone
it it is difficult to to
trying to retain staff.
But also what we really need to
move more people to the online
system who are able
to there's a there's a
lot of lack of
understanding and so what we
have our agency now is though
actually walk you through
when the first time you call
for example to file your weakly
certification we'll try
to walk you through how to do it
online and that way hopefully
you're not calling for an another
26 times
another 25 times
so we're trying to increase the
accessibility of the online system
because we're never going to
be able to hire up to
the level where we have
you know what I would consider a great
response time like
7 minutes or
something
we also using chat bots
which is something that we started
during the
pandemic in you know you've
all had them write your banker
Amazon or whatever pops up
and says do need help and if
so here's a couple
questions we can answer
and and those have been successful
we're updating them now to
to be more relevant posts
pandemic
nobody loves them until their question
is answered and I don't to wait on the phone
anymore than they like a little
more so we're gonna
continue to use those as well
okay thank you Secretary
I know you're doing very best that
you can there thank you madam
chairman that's all I have.
Thank you so much hi Representative
Duncan and then another
others Representative will
use your good
Representative I'm your nor
New you're on
their Lujan
Senator fenics Representative
Johnson anybody else.
Representative Mason all right representative
Duncan you're next thank you
madam chair secretary
I'm not a lawyer either and
so when we
were talking about that issue is there
any thought in your
department how to make that
easier for the lay
person as we go through
this process or is that have to
be a legislative
process.
Madam chair representative
Dunkin or more Duncan I
never I always call you both
of we
are at you know
I reached a level
of personal frustration just
trying to do things like prepare for
these presentations
where we're
going to look at the whole you I
statute beginning to
end and in
not in this coming session but in
the longer one more we have more time to
talk about it we're
going to propose some re writing
and in as much
close to English as we can
possibly get
because I do feel like this is
the frontline sort of
statute this isn't something in the
roll books that no one ever looks at
this is something all of us should
be able to read and understand
and so we'll do that with the
rags to the extent we can but
the they're really bad
you know the run on sentences
there in the statute so
absolutely yes we
would love to
work on re writing not not
necessarily to change the content
but more just to make it a
little more understandable.
Thank you madam chair I think everybody on
this Committee would
to applaud that and
and sign on the
those bills thank you
thank you thank you representative Duncan
Representative on
you. I
got it right.
C. L..
Thank you like to make a little
bit closer toward your
right
thank you madam chair thank you
Secretary more for being
here I had
just a couple questions you touched
on it. Briefly
at the start of your presentation
about gig economy
workers and I was just a little unclear
for the purposes of unemployment
today fall under the self
employed
category.
Madam chair representative on you
know yes they would
be on in most
cases if you're an independent
contractor including a gig worker you were
not eligible for unemployment
okay thank you and
then second
endlessly I'm
we talk a lot about.
And people have been locked out of their
accounts for various reasons
and then kind of giving
up and if
they've been locked out of their
account. Let's say
for fraud and it was determined
that that was.
But there was no fraud
is that then locked
account is that automatically
unlocked or is there a process
that that person then has to go through
themselves to
unlock their account
Madam chair representative on
you there
if there is a long
backlog of locked accounts
so if you call
in preferably on
Wednesday Thursday or Friday
afternoon
then we can
address that right away
otherwise they're happening sort of
in the ordinary course of working
through those backlogs and that's
where people get frustrated so we
would encourage claimants to
either you know email
call us let us know
if you're locked out of your account and
we'll get to that out of sequence
and little sooner alright wonderful
thank you that was all I have
I think you representative Representative
Lujan then Senator Stefanics
Representative Johnson Representative
Mason.
And so I
that's what we've got so Representative
Lujan that Sierra
on there too. Thank you
madam chair I have a few
questions thank
you secretary for being here
with us my first question
is can a
disk pertain to
your actual
agency and
the. The mental
health and behavioural health aspect
of how your
how your employees are doing
enter and how
those provisions are made in
and if you have anything
to add what we could
be doing better for the state or
state employees
and regarding burnout
specially in your agencies we
discuss after the pandemic
and all the things that happened
if you you know where we are
and reasonable
accommodations and all those sorts of
things.
Madam Madam chair
representative Lujan and
thanks for that question
so every
agency probably all of you who own
your own business is now at
coming back from the pandemic
was not a claim reentry
it was difficult
people forgot how
to literally
be in the same space with other
people and all of a sudden
you know they sneeze too
much they drink too loudly
like these are the these are the
level of things that are
because we're already sort of
up to hear mental health wise
these are the sort of complaints that
that we're escalating especially in the
first few months we brought people back
from the pandemic
that said I think we
we do a lot around's
employee morale in
recognition
we do a lot to make
people sort of connect and
to remind them of the good part
of working together which is
instead of 75 emails you
can just walk down the hall and we can
have a conversation and then
we actually even like each
other in in addition to having
the answer to your question
so there's a
lot of just sort of re
integration work that
we've been doing and also I
I do have to let the employee assistance
program we have had
people who you know in the early
stages of an employee dispute
or some behavioral issues will
refer them to the state CAP
and that is a strong program for people
who take advantage of it
we do see a lot of requests
for accommodation
not just for people's
own mental health
but also for their children's
mental health which it took a big
hit during the pandemic
and you know they're
like any other ADA claim
weekly go through that
process and try
to to provide an accommodation if
that's reasonable
medically necessary
so you know in terms
of of what else we could be doing
I think it's just
more of the same and and
also just giving people
time you know there
is there is something to
just getting back
to we got used to the bad
new normal and now we have to get used
to this new normal and
it's really only been a year
since we've been back it's not
even been a year it's been
a year since we sort of
lifted the heavy restrictions and
so. It's gonna take a little time
thank you madam chair I really appreciate
that thoughtful response
and how well you
are aware of everything that's going
on in your agency thank you so much
and if we can do more
we should
my next question
mentors.
In light in in the
conversation of us
discussing the pandemic what
are we doing to prepare if we are
to ever have one
which we are told
different things maybe there's an
eminence but maybe there's not but
what are we doing
for workforce in our
in our state and
and all all around
to prepare for such
Madam.
Madam chair representative Lujan
at so a number of
things because I think we
all know that that wasn't the
the last time we're going to see this
type of major event in our lifetimes
and fortunately
so
we're doing all kinds of things from the
technical and so we just
received a $6000000 grant from
the US department of labor to modernize
our you I system in a lot of that is
going into again
cybersecurity fraud
prevention all those things
that we learned sort of the
hard way would not quite up to
snuff during the pandemic
we're also we also have
a crisis readiness plan
it used to be called
a recession reading as planned
but we learned the hard way that they're
all kinds of crises that have nothing
to do with recession so
we have that in place I think
it every agency might have that in
place but ours
has a lot to do with
just being really clear on how
to increase staffing
in a reasonable way how to use
temps because we have a lot of
rules around what merit staff
has to do
and and how do you deal with
the in person changes in
the availability of in person
services
if we had a little
dry run it with the
potential shut down of the federal
government because of course we
have over 20000
federal employees here in the state
we didn't know how many of them are going to be
deemed nonessential and
and furloughed and
so we use those
as an opportunity to do sort of
a full fire drill
so for that we did
everything from social media
awareness campaign
to staffing
up and having alternative staffing
patterns
ready to go unfortunately
we didn't need to use that we'll see what
happens in November but I think
another really key part is
just taking every opportunity
we can just like
in you know physical
built building safety you got to run
the drill so that it becomes
part of the muscle memory so that next
time it happens we're
ready thank you so
Madam you are doing the training and
and awareness and
all that information piece thank you I
appreciate that to my last question because
of sensitive
time is
we are facing a
time in transition into
automation and
AI.
What are you
learning.
As our a job wise
and in preparing
for that transition
I mean how many jobs are we
looking at the or potentially we
will lose and what we doing
to mitigate those
sorts of things
Madam. Madam
chair representative Lujan so I
do have more of my presentation
is about the employment services sites will
focus on just the wide piece
for here because a
lot of states and including
us are looking at how we can use
a I'm more intelligently
to do things like pattern recognition
to do
machine learning on all of our
data because we have so much data
in the U. I. system to really
understand what we can do more
proactively or where we can tweak
the system to make it more
efficient so we're
in the early stages of doing
that but it it's it's a very
much about into worlds it's
about making our online systems
more efficient
using sort of nudges
within the system to try to get
people to you know not
have to use benefits as long and
to be able to process this budget
faster and
then on
on the cybersecurity
side of course there's a lot that a I
can do to help us
detect threats before they become
real I appreciate that will have a
further discussion thank you madam
chair.
Thank you Representative and I appreciate
bringing out the idea of what
we're looking at things about
like look I use this
often is that we're looking
at like the the tire of a
bicycle lake building on their
multiple spokes
and you know there's
not just one we've all
and learn that there's not
just one solution of things we have to
really look at all of these
components so I appreciate the question
to bring that out we
have Representative Senator
Stefanics Representative Johnson
Representative Mason senator
Tom and Center
still panics you.
Thank you madam chair and I'll be
brief good
morning madam secretary could
you talk about
those individuals
who might come back
to you after their
expiration.
Who have are
claiming that they have
long COVID
symptoms and that they can't
fully return to
work.
Thank you madam chair
Senator Stefanics so
unemployment isn't really designed
as a a program of disability
insurance so we
we don't really look other than
that the causes of
termination why you
left where you left
we don't look at at what
happened afterwards in
in the sense of
determining the length of your budget
so statutorily it's
26 weeks and
and that's where we are there are really
no exceptions to
that but madam
chair and
secretary madam secretary you
talked about
referring people to
can. Work
counselors and and
moving them into
some sort
of training but
are those people.
Trained to deal with
these individuals with long COVID
in the reason I'm asking is
because I have
not a lot but a few
of constituents who have
this condition as
well as my 13 year old
nephew who can't even
go to school except 2 days a
week and so
I think I know this is a real
thing here in our
state then how are we
coping with it if we're cutting
them totally off
Madam chair Senators FedEx
and I'm sorry to hear about your
nephew in yes
we have lots of people in our
lives to help on COVID as
well.
There is so
in our re employment in our employment
services side we have a very
close partnership with DVR
they could the division of vocational
rehabilitation the coal
locate in our
workforce connections office
and so if there were to be
a situation especially
on these folks who were in that the
mandatory part of
the employment services
where it really is an
issue of a physical
ability to work we can
work very closely with DVR
to make sure that we can
provide or train
them for a job that would be
suitable
great thank you very much madam
chair thank you madam secretary
thank you so much Senator Stefanics
and for those behind me I'll have
to like caller if you want to ask
questions.
And that's okay Representative
Johnson and Representative Mason
and then Sierra
Representative Johnson
thank you madam chair
I don't have a question
but I just want to congratulate
you and the team in
Gallup
on several occasions
I've taken a
constituent or to
to the Gallup workforce
solutions office
and the service
there was excellent.
There was one on one
interview process
provided and
many options
of how to fill out an
application and interview
process this is where
jobs are available
today
the case work you
know and training
programs
in addition to you
know filing for what you need to
file for I was very
impressed so
I just want to thank you for your
work there and
the the the
guidance
and the
professional opportunities
afforded because sometimes
when we walk into these
offices that provide
these types of services.
It's almost like we're
burdens you
know like all my gosh
you're here what do you need so
I just want to thank you for your work
in your team thank you
thank you madam chair
thank you Representative Townsend
thank you so much representative
Representative Mason and
senator Tom and then Representative
Zamora.
Madam chairman
secretary
of my first is
kind of the state that more than
that I've been in business
for about 2
years and unemployment
insurance we always thought
this is a good partner for
us as business people
we pay little our employees
by a little if for
whatever reason
what's there's billions of
them but they become
unemployed than this
captive was meant to
keep them from
starving to death to look
and find another
job.
But in recent years it seems to
me that we've of
past.
That a little bit and
you know during the pandemic the
bad thing was it seems
like not the
unemployment benefits with
other benefits added on
to. They were then
better than by lower in
deploys goodbye
so we took
by given out and
extended
benefits
we kind of took the incentive out
of a lot of people even want
to go. When
they could make more money
set at home than they
could.
Coming back to work for me
but the. That
said you know a and
I hope you staffing deal work
no artesian.
Our office is only open 2 days
a week Tuesdays and
Thursdays.
We just went through the process
were you down there to the to that
one presentation or things
with.
Madam chair that makes sense I'm
not sure it was
on.
Steps we're just
as employees could
get help in
the.
Moving people up in their
positions in the.
Getting some help on the impact
we've included that into that a little
bit but which is
a good thing but the.
You know it's
a.
You know 2 days a week it took
us forever to get through
the.
Vehicle business
staffing Ortiz actually has
to staff across
but. Which
is 30 miles away
so they're down there.
A couple of days I don't know that
maybe down there 3 days weeks
growth with the bigger
towns.
It the so.
Is there a plan in place
to get these offices
open 5
days a week
just.
Is that the only offices close
that much I don't know
Madam chair representative
Mason
I wasn't familiar with that
particular stock closure but
I do know that staffing pattern
and and I think both to your
point and to to representative
Johnson's point
we really feel that the in
person services are
what makes us
matter especially in
the the third through
the yeah thank
you.
No we are no you're
right I mean if if you could
go on indeed and
get a job and if that if
everyone could do that
that part of our services would be
needed but especially
in New Mexico are in
person presence is really important
so absolutely let me take
a look at that specific staffing pattern
but we do want to be open 5 days
a week
every other state in our
region and pretty much is
is contracting there
in person we expanded
we opened up in Raton
and incentives that
Issa within the
last 2 years and
so yes
absolutely and also
later this afternoon I'll be at
ICAP asking for money
that is entirely for our workforce
center I'm ready to do
the reveal here and
it's it's all to make
that experience that in person
experience positive
for are inaccessible
the. Thank you but then
secretary no in our
state is used
to all if I needed
to of.
I don't need to all
right.
The kid just coming out
of high school or didn't make it
at a high school or
are entry
level people need help
and I made an in
person.
To guide him through the system
or there is going to fall off the
map.
But anyway I appreciate you for what
you did and then I have
lots of things that could
save good and bad
but as a
rule I think unemployment
insurance is.
Is a good thing if we
get back to just
they have the. I
think you all should be an
insurance unemployment
insurance so
this other stuff.
And this you said needs
to other departments besides
you all for you all of
the what I think
he'll do
well then it's been a big
help to lots of people through
the years.
As a medical madam secretary
more great thank you
Representative US senator
Clemente and then Representative
Zamora.
Thank you madam chair.
So that
mentioned many times you would do a
great chairman and committee
meetings. I
like to think that you.
Mention who's up the next
2 or 3 people up because they're not always
paying attention thank
you.
Yes.
Thank you madam secretary for
being here. Are
you going to inject it 3 or
4 months and
madam chair senator Tom
in a year and 2
months.
Within a longer I thought
only one press with
your.
Command of the
situation in your
department even
though that's not really your will
our but thank you
for being here thank on page
13 you've got a.
Chart. And
get the August
unemployment
34000.
Is that the number of unfilled
jobs.
And madam chair Sierra that you're
setting me up perfectly for
the the back half of my
presentation but yes
that is that is the
number.
So that is what we
call the estimated employment
gap yeah estimate
employment gap so that orange
is the sort of supplied
of unemployed workers
who were looking for a job the
blue our
job opening estimates
as best as we can get
and the oranges
place between the blue and
the orange lines
is the estimated employment gap
which is currently at as
of August twenty third twenty
twenty three it was at 30
4000 300 people
what that means is that if
everybody who
is unemployed looking for work
got a job tomorrow there would
still be 30 4000
300 vacancies in the
state.
Thank you for the answer madam chair
and then the the
number of unemployed
35.
On the just under
36000.
Can I assume that doesn't count
those not looking.
Madam chair Sierra that's
correct.
So what's the
right so my final
question is so what's
the major reason why there's
such a gap as a cause.
People don't.
Is that it's not because they don't want to
work for they would be
looking it is a
major reason because they're not
qualified for the
openings.
Madam chair senator Tom
in you know labor force
participation is what you're talking
about so those are the folks who I like
I could call them and the folks sitting on
the bench they're not looking for
work there's a
variety of reasons
for that some
are not qualified
for what they perceive as available
jobs some
are I have disability
that precludes them from working
and some are out
there for other reasons summer
care giving for
parents for children for
grand children
some are
retired but they're below
that age of 65 and so
they're still showing up in the in
the denominator
and then you know we we are
constantly working to understand
the folks who just aren't
because
because they don't see the
value in having a
job because they think that
their participation in the
informal economy
it may be more lucrative
and and that's the population
that we really have to work
as a state and
and specially is our department to
get off the bench and back into the
labor market.
Thank you thank
you for being here thank you for the
test that's all I have a
manager okay thank you
senator Tom and Representative
Zamora and if there's anybody
else.
Okay okay that's
it Representative more than
and Representative I'll
come. Thank
you madam chair and thank
you madam
secretary.
When you drive down the
street.
And you see homeless
people there have
their tents.
At their end.
Under bridge or
whatever we're starting
to see them all over the state I was
surprised.
In Los crucis here the other day
and I was surprised how
many. I
was almost
crucis.
As secretary of workforce
solutions do you
ever imagine
how maybe you could help
all members think about
how we as a
state and use secretary
workforce solutions could
help that
issue that we're having across
the state.
Madam chair representative Ms
more I really appreciate that
question so
yes and
home a lot of people don't realize this
but for our
workforce innovation opportunity
act are we owe a federal
program working
with youth there
homelessness is one
of our target population so
we do a lot of work with youth
experiencing homelessness
but we also have to
specific programs that are
aimed at this one we
color housing stability program
and it's using federal are but
dollars that were still left
over but basically
if you can demonstrate that
you're housing instability was
due to the COVID
you lost your job you lost
your living situation
or whatever then
we can help you with wraparound
services that includes we can
give you a laptop we can get you
in training we can give you close
we can help you find childcare
vouchers we can do
all those things and we we
cooperate with nonprofit organizations
in the state
to to get you back on your feet
with the goal of getting you in
stable housing
that that funding will run out in
the middle of next year and
there's no more federal funding to go
around for that but we
also have behavioral health
folks involved in that program
because we know that population
isn't
isn't just struggling because
they're they're not working hard enough they've
got a a number of of
co morbidities sometimes that are
that are affecting them so
we think that's been a really great
program and and we would love to see
a way to continue that
and then finally we are partnering
we're going to be actually co locating
in the gateway center which is a
large sort of multi
service center in the Albuquerque
area for
homeless people so the idea
behind the gateway center is there's a
a shelter and then
without leaving the building you can
get to services you can get to
re hobby can get to detox
you know that sort of the idea
that if you have your moment
of clarity when you're in the shelter you
can get whatever service you need
to have people in there doing hair cuts
it's kind of amazing so
we're going to be one of the the tech
community partners in there
specifically to do exactly
what you're talking about and we
would love to be able to do that in other
parts of the state as. As
a I think more more people realize
the value of having those services
co located.
Thank you for that Madam chairman
and madam secretary
that's that's good
news to
hear.
I I see these people in
a and I think how do we help
them and where do we start
and we need to legislate
something in
Howell.
Because because it seems like they're
stuck in a rut.
And how do we help them get
back on that road
and.
I think a lot of really good
peoples were too
afraid to talk to him and stuff
but when you talk to
one or something they seem to be
real polite and
nice and I
mean I don't go around talking to help
them but but the few
that I've talked to seem.
They're they're people just like
us but they're they're in this bad
situation.
And how can we help them get back
on track.
And maybe some like
like you just mentioned madam
secretary madam chair it
is they don't have the
computer they don't have that hook
up they don't have that.
So so hopefully in the future
maybe we could do something
to. Get
those people back in
indoors and and
talking to people that can help them
and and
I'm happy to
hear. To
just your response to the
question thank you madam
chair and thank you Mr secretary.
Thank you Representative
in just a a
highlight isn't mentioned
Los crucis and just my connection
with the on house community there through
the C. Valley Community of
Hope workforce
connection through your
department is
holding a job ready this fair
they're at the mercy though I Community
of Hope next Wednesday
to be able to
provide job search
assistance assessment
testing resume building
interview preparation
to assist tuition assistance
and other free services
so there are opportunities
there but again we're looking at
it like the wheel of a tire and
there's so many different things
that are impacting that
and as we talked about many
of us affordable
housing once we can get folks
into houses and getting
jobs and
get the mental health care that they
need in the medical health and
so I do appreciate that
recognition of that
and thank you secretary
because through that and I know
that that's to federal assistance as
well that you're able to do
that so that that is happening next
Wednesday in Los
crucis we
have Representative all come on and then
representative
Allison.
Thank you madam chair
my question comes up
after listening to some of the other
questions how do
you decide where
you're going to have an
office
in the state of New
Mexico.
Madam chair representative al
cone you know
we've we've been in most
of these locations
for for a
long time
our state is divided into
4 local workforce
development boards and
so they also
have a role in
determining where we have
a new location and I wasn't
there when we picked for town incentives
that is that but my understanding was
there was just sort of advocacy
for it so
you know we do have a an
essentially flat federal budget
so we we kind of hit the
ability of the wall of our
ability to
staff new places
and pay for for new places
but certainly
we would love to be in more in
more parts of the
state there's a
big.
Chunk that you might
recognizes Representative of Armstrong's
district to add that that
we don't have a presence and there's
some other chunks of the state where our
map is bearing we
would love to get there we just don't have the
resources to do right now.
So just out of curiosity
madam chair madam
secretary there is
no mandate for one
office in each
county.
Madam chair representative a call
now. Thank
you and there is no mandate for
80 hours for
anybody
Madam chair representative
Alcon.
It's pretty basically madam chair
I guess what I'm understanding this
what we can
afford.
Madam chair representative L. code
yes thank you thank you
madam.
Thank you representative
Allison.
Thank you madam chair
my first question would
be.
With the displace workers
in the 4 corners area
are some of whom still
applying for
unemployment.
Madam chair representative
Allison I think we've
seen sort of the first
phase taper off so just
for folks who might not be as
familiar this
legislature passed the energy transition
act in 2019
and then last year with your
leadership in the co sponsorship
of representative Duncan Representative
Montoya we
were able to pass a law that broadened
eligibility for the dislocated
workers fund so
we had $12000000
from PNM to help those
dislocated workers and then the
governor added another
15.4000000
so our first round of that program
was a direct assistance
because we heard clearly from the
community losing your job is
expensive we heard
clearly from the community we don't
want to lose those people in San Juan
County and so
we gave the
opportunity for any displaced
worker to receive a 1 time
payment of $20000
and I think that's what you're referring
to that
has pretty much tapered off
and I have a whole
other a presentation on that
they're actually up there
today with the
community advisory committee to talk
about the next phase of what to do with
that money and then you'll hear us talk about
that. But
we are currently
that's
487
Act applications approved
and pretty much
most of those paid for that one
time payment we're also
setting aside about
1.$1000000 for
workers who we know are going
to lose their job when reclamation
efforts are over at the money in the
plant and so we have
that money tax for them whenever they
separate service
but we've we've seen those level
off.
Okay thank you for
that madam secretary
the reason why I ask is
because I have
seen recently
advertisement for
employment with the Navajo
Nation with
the a
big agricultural farms
and things like that I'm just
wondering if people just don't
want to go to work for those
companies.
I the reason for my
question and the second
part of my question madam
secretary is
I know you did not cover
anything with
displace workers but
as you mentioned the
conveners are meeting
at. In
Farmington today
so.
Of.
There was 15000000
in addition to the
original fund that
was put into
the fund by the governor and this past
session and
of the original
20000000
was disbursed to displace
workers there
was 4000000 still
outstanding
so the
people that are still working on
include 46
I very workers
and then I
at the Westmoreland
I. B. E. W.
how are those payments could
be distributed
to the remaining 51
workers does that
mean that according to my
calculation that
they would get like
78000 instead
of the 20000
like the rest of the people
or how is the payment
distribution to the
remaining 51 people going to
be Madam
chair representative Allison
so that 20000
was a flat one time payment
so whenever they
separate service
with their employer whether
that's the money or the or
PNM we'll get
that that payment we really
looked at whether there was any
way to just get those payments
out the door because we don't like sitting on
money but we
don't read we read the
act of to say
that that has that person has to have
lost their job in these folks are
still employed so we're just holding
it we are in
contact there they've already
pre filled out their applications
and all we have to do is hit approve
when they when they demonstrate that they've
lost their jobs
to your first question
what according to our data
which was all through the application
process we have about
157
of those workers
who are not working
and.
Full time not working for full time
or part time and and
they're not retired so about
a third of folks retired
of the remainder
157 are
not working full time or part
time enough those only
about 30 are back in
school so
that is going to be the
population that we really
need to to focus on
for face to we
gotta get these folks
engaged trained
and and back at work
assuming that that's what they want
so of course we want to respect
that you tech process and I know they're coming
out with their recommendations
today but my
understanding is that they'll be
supportive of a plan
that that includes
focused re training
apprenticeship and
what we really want to do is is
partner with employers in the
region to say okay
what exactly do you
need what are those
professions whether
certifications and
then make that strong connection
because from
from all the workers I talked to and I
know you all talk to them
to
there is there there's
a little bit of draft
the folks are a draft the
money and the plant were
such an anchor of the community
for so long generations
is you know you work there Representative
Montoya also worked in
that world and
so it folks
just it it this was not
imaginable and
unfortunately I think this is a dress
rehearsal for a lot of our future
right and imaginable things are gonna
happen in the work force and we have
to give people time
to recover but also
stay in that constant
contact so our
team is amazing I mean they've
they've kind of they've grown to
think of these displaced workers as
family Amy
in our Farmington office I think
you've all met you know she's
just very passionate about this work
as they all are up there
and.
That's what we have to do is we have to just
keep knocking at the door and
making those opportunities available
until folks are engaged
in labor market.
Okay thank you for that
madam secretary and
chair of the last
part of my question is
there are still 15000000
in the first place worker
fund and today
the conveners are
meeting in Farmington
and they're talking about
of the money that's allocated
to the economic development
and the Indian Affairs.
Would they have a state
income.
The 15000000 that's
allocated to the displaced
worker fund I should
think not.
At Madam chair
representative Allison I
think we we are
want to hear those recommendations
I mean I I'm not sure of
the legality of whether they have a
state but my understanding is that
there recommendations are going to
say we want to see re
training we want to see people
connect to jobs
and we want to see you working
with the employers and in the
region and that's what we think is the right
thing to do as well so
assuming that that's what comes out of
the of the plan
at the committee then
we'll be getting ready to launch our
plan in the in the coming weeks and
will certainly be talking closely
to all the Representative
that area into the legislature
as a whole.
Okay thanks for that thank
you madam chair thank you
Representative appreciate
that and and I really

just realistic approach
to what are
workforce is experiencing
and the
I want to commend you because
the fact that you
are very familiar with the
different communities that have
had
you know in an
unusual amount of
unemployment
and have unique
circumstances
I think that it's
because of you why you why
this being recognized
and and I I'm really
grateful for that and I think
this committee is
is is
hopeful
because you've got
a hot mess on your hands in
the future and we all
know that I think the thing is
is that we're we're understanding
that there are challenges that employers
have their challenges
that employees have
it's not just a one stop
solution
and
I I feel confident
and I don't know if the committee I don't want to
speak for the committee but I I feel
just by the shaking of heads
is that we feel confident in
you.
And so very
grateful for that and
in appreciate your
transparency
that you're sharing with us because
we you know there's the elephant the
room that you addressed
right off the bat so very
grateful for that so
thank you Secretary for
that appreciate that
chair of any other questions
before we turn her loose and give her
a minute we do have
a quorum so if
you want to stand up and and
stretch your legs
thank you want to the rest of I
don't I don't have to but I
I know you wanted to hear about business
services so once you go ahead
and cover that and then
we'll then we'll take care
of business well we switch
panels after you're done
thank you madam chair so
at the the but one of the questions
we got from you is what do you do
to help businesses and
you know a think a lot of
you of the members here T. this
up but just as a reminder
so we have an applicant
database we can help you search
for qualified candidates and it
includes the people who have recently
become unemployed
we can help you customize your
applicant recruitment we
do paid and unpaid
marketing we do rapid hires
we can prescreen
we can help you with skills assessments
like work keys that might
broaden the potential pool of
employees and I just wanna
highlight we did a it
you know it's really the team they did a
rapid higher for CYFD
child protective services
so if you think your business is having
trouble hiring child
protective services is a
rough road to hoe and
we got in over 700
candidates statewide for
their 500 jobs and they made
120 offers in the
first 40 8:00 hours after
that job there
so our team
is pretty amazing they
did great little tick
tocks of employees talking
about whether passionate about their work
all the way to
you know conventional recruiting
methods of blasting all of our
folks who are in our database
so we're we're
good at this and
I I would just encourage businesses
out there to let us help them
and then of course under the
10 if I were program there
are wage subsidy type
of programs
we can help you with on boarding
strategies we have. We
have a business consultant who can help
you design an
onboarding for your new employees
that'll get them connected to your mission
so that that you're more likely to
stay stay with them
and then the last thing I have in here
that you can read at your
pleasure is
the budgetary requests
and because
all those will be before you shortly
but I did want to highlight the
pro be proud program
which is a
semi trailer that is
fitted with a 15
bless you for 2 out virtual
reality stations they
get kids inspired about the
trades I thought it was kind
of silly when I inherited this
program I saw it in North
Carolina it's amazing
so the truck
is going to be here soon it'll be
at our work force conference October
25 and 20 sixth in
Albuquerque we're gonna
have our sort of
reading cutting on
it in

amazing CTE program that will

moment comments thoughts

Yes Representative
0.
When a user Mike is our microphone
over there.
Okay.
Madam chair and madam
presenter my question
to you is thank you for the information
about the CTE programs
it's really great I I do
hope that we'll be able to have
a internships for
those students who are in doing
those programs and
so that we are really going our
own but what are you doing
about women in the trades
in 2024 I didn't
hear you talk about
that Madam
chair representative of Herndon
thank you for raising
that at you know 1 of
the focuses would be pretty proud
I think is is getting to
grow girls and young
women when they're a little bit younger in high
school because I think just naturally
they're not getting that exposure to C.
T. E. that that some
of the male students are getting we also
of course have the women in the trade
summit that we're because
we're expecting in March of next year
we're excited about that
and we do
have pre apprenticeship
that's currently funded with to your
our money so we'll be coming back
to ask for more of that
that and we'll have data for
you at that time but we've had
over 280 pre
apprentices come through our program
so far and
in including a lot of young women
who are excited about careers that they
they hadn't thought about before
so just want to
echo our support for women in the
trades and it's 1 of our priority
areas in our for your state
plan.
Thank you madam chair thank you
madam presenter.
