percent.
Thank you as the mother chairman
members of the committee a
housemate more of fifteen
basically asked the pineatte in
yasco school district the
transfer historic building
that's been utilised by the
metro and the strength as much a
domestic by the last tramper's
language and the traditional
second in that valley and
and mister chair
you might say well white down
what is a significant so this
memorial
last year they want to sell our
best language came before this
committee
with a request of supporting a
memorial.
Asking the county of.
Really were the transfer a
county building to the one body
store this language.
Of a building acting as a
community center that the airs
built.
Fifty years ago.
And.
The language then took
temperature as it passed the
floor and.
Presented it.
Before the summit the reality of
a county commission and the
county commission agreed to do
the transfer.
And in this session the humble
some of those language which is
located waste of a week you in
south of a big udam is bringing
for the capital out a.
To
enhance the years the structure
of the community center so in
their conservative we bring this
memorial forward with this
escalator building up which my
expert will indulge you as to
what it means to the community
and the potential that this
escalator building has in moving
forward the agenda of the
meeting domestic the language.
So mister chair I like to yield
to
alex moppers who has a dual hats
he's present of the last
vampires language and also a
president.
Turn it over to him to kind o.
The.
Mister president
mr members are committee thank
you thank you for allowing to
speak behalf of this.
Of this memorial.
I don't know how many of you
have been to the community of us
but.
I said.
A length also a language sent to
two master postal the real
astronposed language which was
built and introduced a community
in.
This with that with that
language came
some people that actually
establish a car families and
they built the church and they
built the community.
This particular building here is
part of is one of the buildings
that was built in that time that
time frame.
It's only a one room building.
There was private of one time.
The family owned it from
seventeen fifty one to to seven
to nineteen fourteen.
As when I sold it to.
A boy disclosed created by this
list of asking minister people.
To bring a school into the
system into the community so
they were able to rest our money
to buy that building which was
not much a hundred twenty five
dollars
but it was big enough it was
enough money to buy that little
building to.
To follow board at the time to
bring in a school system into
th.
So they did.
They joined in together with the
pinosco system.
And be necessarily brought into
teachers and.
From seventeen from nineteen
fourteen to nineteen sixty one
the the system binasco system
occupied that building.
The.
Well nineteen sixty one.
The system decided to decide.
All the list and become into the
panel square year.
So so from nineteen sixty one to
nineteen nineteen eighty five.
Ah.
The building just kind of stayed
there used by the people the
stumpers for whatever they
wanted to use it.
Until nineteen eighty five when
the community again got together
and said we need to improve this
building winter fixes buildings
following part.
So they did.
In a meantime.
A.
We went to they went to I was
part of it went to.
The pinescore system system and
ask him if they would donate it
to the the community.
And is that nor.
But we will listen to you for
twenty years for one dollar.
And there's acceptable what they
did they listed to the community
for twenty years.
So in in the meantime the
billion was used for all these
things that are mission in this
memorial
for meetings for gatherings for.
Hosting other people that came
into a community of for biffier
time because the community that
the building doesn't have a
facilities only has electricity
right now and you're never did
have elected intent to.
Got hold of it in.
And they are they b.
But in nineteen eighty five we
got a lease.
From penescular school system
and we decided we're going to
improve the building so we did
his wife fixed the floor fixed
the ceiling fix the roof.
Still for the different
communities issues which is a
the second the land went wasn't
really together there at the
time but but we used it for that
to end.
The only one had revenue was
mutual domestics because they
have members which are domestic
in the structure starting
nineteen sixty one.
And it's been probably since
then so there are the ones that
actually have a little bit of
revenue pleasure pay the light
or stuff like that if you fix
the building.
So.
What took position we took
position with a lot stopped as
much as domestic to possession
of responsibility
in the light fixing the building
and
actually making it a community
to build it again.
The.
Okay so that the lease was
but toward in two thousand and
two we went back to school
system as for the building again
and is it not we'll give you
give you an other twenty twenty
earliest.
So.
In the meantime we've been cut
pretty much the in control of
the building and.
Mixed and accessible to all
other things that need to happen
there like a medium for the
secure medias for the language
for hosting people in
recognition on faces you are
directly have been there
and we actually have hosted
people like congressional people
from washington and a people
from the state and so we do use
it as as the community building
you know is it's not a community
building yet.
But.
Actually belongs to the school
system so we've been asking for
this billion to be part of.
Strump us mutual domestic so we
could use it continue to use it
as a result will need to be used
by the whole community.
So.
Are you have been.
In contact we have in in contact
with the school system for.
Ears just trying to get this
thing back earned out it seems
like every time the board
changes members.
Thanks for the part especially
when it is
super tendence or when you
change.
Other members of the board.
They fall apart and we go back
to asking for as for this
building and but now
it seems like this the school
was to get rid of it pressure by
the state to get rid of it
because actually belongs to the
state.
They want to get rid of this
building.
We've been trying to.
Meetings to try to
give it out give it to us or
sell it to us with something.
So this seems that consistent is
that they want to sell it.
For how much I don't know we
haven't told us yet.
Because they meet once once a
month and they do this
discussion sometimes it's in
discussion sometimes it's not
and and they table it in
nothing happens really.
I met mister garcia
representative on the.
With weeks ago and we talked
about it as well maybe if we
introduce a house memorial maybe
this will help so that's why it
has how this came about.
The.
So this is a.
I'm asking the commission here a
committee here in a masking.
Everybody that would better
support this maybe with your
efforts we can get this building
to become.
Owners of the community.
We ask you support this bill
house beyond me more of it
fifteen.
Would appreciate it if you did
if you did.
And.
Because we do need it and we do
you step with the community
thank you.
Thank you thank you mister
chaira with that we sample
questions I think i'm mister
lopez and really elaborated on
the issue the history.
All in favor of memorial
fifteen.
Anybody on zoom in favor of
house.
Yes I am can you hear me
this weekend.
Hi hello thank you for letting
me speak to you today we assume
my name is amount of bissell I
am the president of the pinyasko
school board
overall I am neutral on this
house memorial however I do
think the committee should be
aware that there is a very
prescriptive process outlined by
ped and the state board of
finance that dictates house
school boards can dispose of
property the pinyasco school
burdens currently in the process
with the last thread by smooth
all domestic water association
in fact we just passed a
resolution in december to
transfer the building to the
mutual domestic the memorial has
no legal way on the process
outlined by the key so we will
so it will have no bearing on
the process that this school
district is currently in
it might however confuse the
process as the residents have
last through bus in the
directors of the mutual domestic
may be lead to think that this
house memorial will have bearing
on the process the school build
is legally bound to follow.
I also encourage the committee
to honor the responsibilities
that authority of local school
districts and the communities
that we serve.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yes I good morning and gave
mister chairman members of the
committee this is letter
martinez president a south in
the literally great sir and we
stone in structure for a house
more of fifteen
and returning to this property
back to them and say the
strumpus and just to point out
to
and at least specific comment
this mean I have any significant
impact on their decisions making
but it will have some weight on
the school board to move on this
they have been sitting at a long
enough and they need to move
thank you miss chip chairman
thank you.
Anybody in the audience one.
Mister chair what if I suppose
because of the something.
Convince the school board that
it is.
Well I think we'll be helpful
and I think this morning
and and I think that's probably
one of the things that the board
could consider during their
meetings and I myself be
participated with the supposed
another agencies of the lead to
area he tried to convince the
board
in people school to help us with
some of the facilities that
they're no longer using to turn
over to the language were
domestics communities can use
them instead of being vacated or
just basically going to warns
and so I think this would be
helpful.
Chairman gore members on the up
of the woods.
We support any process that will
help mangrants get properties
ba.
If this will help the board move
a little bit faster or better
great so we support it and you
ask that you guys supported and
help us do the thing.
The.
Mister chair and board members
jason into the president of the
months.
Vice chair of the language and
several
I mean this is testimony just
like we're talking earlier
hundreds of years of the people
being in these locations and
doing whatever they can with
what they have they're not
asking for a million dollars
building their asking for
something that is outdated not
even being used anymore and if
it helps
one of the things that we need
to point out is that the
language don't just help the
earth they help their community
everybody who lives there we
have people that are not living
in our language obviously we
just want to guarantee that
there is
you know facilities and places
for people to come to together
in two social access versus
computers and stuff all the time
so
hundred percent in in.
Here.
Some process
without a thing that can do are
you represented for the service
diversity
now i'm not.
Mister chair.
They involved in this process
mister chair I visited with
mister lockba.
The.
We haven't approached me to.
Took today
thank you.
Yeah.
In the school boards are.
Certain regul.
But
according to her
process is going.
But the list of the other call
mister chairman amazon with the
escalator building on the in
conyones on the home party
start.
The county also has a sim.
Properties the local government
so this is not in our end
anything new it just part of the
process when the local
government is disposing a
property in this particular case
to another local.
So we're not impeting in their
price as mister check which is
kind of enhancing the need for
the transfer that's what we're
doing with the memorial distant
handsing the need for that for
the.
Yeah.
That's kind of
better process
but thank you i'll listen to the
rest of that.
He was terrible quick.
That's serious business okay
mister representative thank you
for coming over night and I know
your.
To talk to you at a united
states plus and I want to make
sure mister jam i've got the
right place because of only been
there once I can remember other
than just driving through that
the the most body those across
the street from the well across
the parking lot or whatever from
the church.
Representative assessed
yesterday we have hosted the
blankets and was a lot of people
in others will it the
several times and that is that
the only other building the left
it up public beyond another in
the church this left.
To the community when it was.
Mr chairs representative
in australia didn't catch your
name I can't remember your name
because I met you it's been
about eight months ago alex
locus mister lowest okay.
So mr lopus before we get into
everything we need to see that
church opened up for mass more
often I just leave that
mister chair representative
I see that you guys have a lease
police are current lease that
ends in twenty two.
Mr
with you ask the same question
one more time yes sir mister
chair representative you have a
you doesn't in a current lease
that ends in twenty twenty four
for twenty five dollars is that
a year a month what is that
ear a year here.
And mister chair representative
whose responsible for the
maintenance for that building
and I think you probably said it
I had to go.
The shareholder resident reps in
interest is
the school system amendments
the stump is mutual domestic to
responsibility of it twenty some
years ago and still have
responsibility of it so much you
can represent what you're
telling me as a school district
doesn't put any funds in there
mutual do us takes care of all
that this too okay so much fair
representative I have I think
i'm one of these representatives
and like many that believe in
local making decisions and we
see that was chair in our school
districts that the the fight of
the state trying to push a five
day so for day and things were
were instance that's just that
for instance where as I believe
in the school board
having the power to manage their
own
school districts in in the way
they see and so although this is
a benefit.
Memorial that you know doesn't
force the the school district it
is a message still from the.
The.
But the the I see a possibility.
On a way that you could do this
if I was in your shoes mister
chair representative what I
would use I will take that on
I would take that
I would take that another twenty
five year lease or longer.
And what I would do with the
option to purchase in I wouldn't
mister chair represent.
Negotiate the price
so that you're not negotiated in
twenty years when the rate
because of the value of property
generally goes up so if I was
negotiating with you mister
chair representative i'd say no
school district what I i'd like
that lease option but if you're
to sell that property would you
sell it to me for at all fifty
thousand dollars and if they
agree to that put it in the
terms of your lease
and then of course that you're
responsible for the maintenance
or whatever that way it gives
you twenty five years to find
fifty thousand dollars through
capital outlet to buy that
property rather than then if
it's never transferred only if
it doesn't get transferred to
gives by a little bit of time I
I would always exercise at these
these option worst case in
earlier you're out twenty five
years at twenty five bucks.
Mental calculations that is a
good lease I would never let.
Still allows you to maintain
control of that property and
then if you put it with a.
Price is a small building maybe
you can get it back to.
Thanks.
The.
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you mister chair just
simply
technically since it's a it's a
memorial I see as benign does in
a message in other day you want
to remember my everybody of the
local representative.
To find other options to make
that a possibility.
Yeah.
Thank you mister chairman's
committee in the way to take you
up on the offer on the breakfast
