All right let's go ahead and
get that we we do have our
folks here
Armen you want to come on up
and sit at the table as well
I'm here all part of the same
panel.
And Mike.
So if we can just move
to more of those chairs of that's
all right we do have
a full panel
we've got Raquel Espinoza
who is the senior director of public
affairs for union
Pacific
we have built a veritable
rental who's director of the land and
development sales for our our
resources we
have our into he'll executive
administrator office of the president
for the Navajo Nation
and we also Mike stark was the
county manager of San Juan
County talking
about the economic impact of shortline
railroads I do want to thank
Representative
Montoya
for really
highlighting what is happening up in the
4 corners areas were very excited
about hearing about that
today
because we're we're
finding throughout the presentations
that were so connected in so
many ways and you know I
often think of like
whatever if I have
to order something online I don't
really think about the origins and
how it got there but
we're learning about that and
these are folks who who really
have kind of the nuts and bolts of all
of that and
so I'm very excited about that so
Raquel I think
we're gonna have you go head start
and then you'll just go ahead and continue
to throw on down the line
and and will be able
to do you much good over just a little bit
so these fellas can also have access
to the table.
Thank you so
much.
And you know kind of like are in your
chair like is really low
and.
In the little kids see now
it's okay I just
I'm like I've I feel your discomfort
because I'm like well feels like my
my rear end is like a foot from
the
floor.
You're welcome for that one our
account I will
want to go ahead and take it
away.
Right the red
light can you hear me
now
okay.
Well welcome everyone to
the Oneonta county welcome of the
border it's so great
to see you here
I want to thank Senator
Hamblen for bringing you
here I'm
sure that Jerry
myself and
others has spoken
with you about some that
that is a at
1.or
another.
And this is
a place where you
really have to see
it to understand
it and what it's doing
for this community so I
really appreciate those of you who made
the long trek to come
here.
I am presenting here
with one of you
Pacific's partners
it's really making a big difference and
and so that that just saw it
about the model from iron horse
resources
and you'll learn more about
how he's helping
companies based here and
bringing new
companies to
set up facilities
here. So
roads move goods
that we use
every day the
television that you use
or the computer that you
used to monitor
this morning's headlines
moved on one of our
trains.
When you get
in your car that
probably moved on one of
our trains
so.
As you think about
that
everything that we touch
including food.
Or items that are in our
house right now they all
moved by train at some
point in time and that's why what
we do matters.
So.
The second slide that
I have an about
trust you're able to follow
along is
a map of the union Pacific
railroad
network.
We have 32000
miles of track and operate in
23 states that
are west of the Mississippi
River.
Not many people would think of
us as an international
company we don't have
tracks anywhere
outside of these 23
states but the
fact of the matter is that we
connect with
the key Gulf
coast and California
point.
The Canadian railroads and we
are the only class one
railroad in
the country to serve
all
gateways to Mexico
and you see there they
go Calexico
Nogales and
Possil eagle pass
Laredo and
Brownsville.
I want to point out
the line that moves
from Los Angeles
toward the east
into it possible.
That is our
since that route
and it is a critical
artery for our country
because this is
where.
Boxes
full of
products clothing
Nike shoes
of computers
this is where they arrive
by ship from the
Pacific Rim once
they arrive at the California
point those
boxes the containers
that you've heard about this
morning are placed
on a train and they
come through this
critical route
I'll come back to the
sunset route
in a few slides but
I really like how this map
in particular connects the
dots.
So safety
is.
Our top priority at union
Pacific and that's why we
invest billions of
dollars.
In our network we
we do it every year and
this year we're investing
3.$6000000000
in our infrastructure.
Little over half of that
is spent replacing
the rails the ties
making sure that everything
is properly maintained and that
our trains are operating
on the safest tracks.
Our second largest spend is
on equipment including
locomotives followed
by building
commercial facilities or
rail to
support.
Companies that come to us saying
I have this business
and but they need some
support are we need
support to help accommodate
that growth followed by
technology.
So this shows our commitment
to ensuring that we
build a sustainable
real network
that helps our communities
prosper.
The next
slide.
The $2000000000
that we are investing
this your honor on
infrastructure
are part of our safety
efforts and part of
our derailment prevention
efforts.
So when we
look at real lines
today. They
kinda look the same
as they did in our history
books but that is
far from the truth
these are
technological runaways
outfitted with sensors
and technology
that ensures that.
The health of the train
is monitored
and that we catch things
before
and not just an accident can
occur. So
we have.
Technology that
takes the temperature
of every we'll
on every train.
They measure the bearings
we have acoustic
technology that
monitors the sound.
And.
Itemset to look at the
wheels and even
have machine vision
that helps us
look at the train in real
time as it's
moving.
And the and stop the train
if we need to if there's some
sort of an anomaly
on that train.
So.
The important part of this is
that we're always
looking for ways to
improve
upon our safety.
In addition to all this technology
our.
Our track team inspects
real lines.
Every day and they
look at their on
specialized trucks you can
write on the rail and they're doing
visual inspections
to make sure that things are okay
those inspections increase when it's
hot because it can affect
the rail.
And then we also
have.
Special rail cars
that are equipped with technology that
monitors the
geometry
and any
imperfections the rail
that includes a
hairline.
Fracture the cannot be seen with
the naked eye.
This is what we do to
make sure that our tracks
are safe and so we're
always looking for new technologies
to help us do that.
And when we find an
anomaly the
technology finds an anomaly
then we
will stop the
trade immediately depending
on on what it is
has identified
or it could decide
what we're going to
prepare at the next
stop.
At the next location
so.
This isn't very important
to to union Pacific into
all rural roads
and then of course there's
public safety we're always
educating people
about using caution
when they approach
the rail lines
and we
work on this also with
our communities
Dona ana county was
very successful
in securing a
grant from the federal government
to build an overpass
at industrial
road.
Certainly truck
traffic has increased it's
going to continue to increase as
all of this growth takes place
of the growth that you've heard
about.
In addition to that
train traffic
is probably going to go up as well
and so I
commend the
county
of and for non
the must see us for not
only looking to address
things that can you be improved
now but looking forward
at all of the growth
it's going to happen here
and address
that right
now.
On the next slide.
I want to talk about
hazmat
shipments.
Railroads are
obligated.
To transport
hazardous products
whether we want to or
not.
And in some cases
we'd rather not but
we take our responsibilities
seriously and
we understand that the reason
that we have this
federal obligation is
because it is
the safest way
to move these chemicals
above
ground.
The incident in Ohio
certainly put a
spotlight on
shipments involving hazmat
on trains.
But the truth is
99.9
percent of all
hazmat shipments
that move by real
arrive to their destinations
without an
incident.
The accident rate
involving hazardous
materials and trains
has declined 55
percent since
2012.
This while big
rig accidents involving
hazmat has increased
155
percent in the last
10 years but
that said.
We don't want any
accidents that's a great
safety record but we're always
looking to improve upon
that.
And there are also
other things that we've
done to
advocate for
safer
transportation
including.
Going to the government asking them
for safer tank car
standards we
have now.
Thank cars that
are.
Our.
Basically built
with years of
steel
and special
protective
housings on the
valves to
ensure that if there was
an accident.
Whatever's in the tank or is going
to remain in that tank
car.
So
this to
representative away that
we are always looking
to. Improve
upon our safety
record and and a lot of
cases we don't
own the cars the
cars belong to our
customers and we work
very closely with them
to ensure that
when we pick up the car
it is prepared and
secured the way it's
supposed to the way
regulations
up call for
and then once we
we have that
inspections done and then
our crews will take those
cars out of the customer's
facility.
So the next slide I do
want to cover the
environmental benefits of
moving goods by
rail. It
takes about 300
trucks to move the same
amount of goods
as one of the union Pacific's
intermodal trains that you see
passing through here
every day multiple
trains.
We're 34 times
more fuel efficient than
trucks.
And then we can
move about.
500 miles
on one.
Gallon of diesel and that would
be moving a ton
of freight nearly 500
miles on a
single gallon
of diesel I sure do wish
that my car
had that kind of
mileage
addition to that the benefit
to moving goods
through New Mexico by
rail is
that.
Trains release
75 percent
fewer greenhouse
gas emissions than
trucks so we're
also quite passionate about
making sure that we are
offering real
service to businesses that need
to move drugs and
economical way but
also in a way
that protects
our
environment.
So now we get to the fun
part New
Mexico.
You'll see there that here
in New Mexico we've got
2 key routes the
one that comes in through large bird
in a sense that that is not and
then the route that goes from
some that that is a toward
2 can carry.
Both of these are key
routes the line
that goes to 2 can carry
is a major
artery for
Midwest markets.
And then the
the line that comes through
some of that asset and
moves to el
Paso.
Is a key route for
all of the markets.
To the east that would
include San
Antonio
to New Orleans.
Any part of
of where
that company
wants to move
their rail car.
So here in the in New
Mexico we have about
400 employees
and our payroll is
about.
$40000000
here in the state.
We purchased
2.$2000000
a drugs in the state
and our capital investment the
amount of money that
we.
Spent last
year to
replace and renew our
real lines here in New
Mexico was
44.$9000000
this happens every
year every year there is
there is funding for
us to ensure that we
we make sure that
our trains are off
operating on the safest
tracked.
So.
In New Mexico
you'll see there the top
commodities that are shipped the
top commodities that
are either received.
Or originate here in New
Mexico by
companies that are looking
to send their their goods
elsewhere auto
parts in minerals being
the most prevalent.
Commodities that
come through New Mexico
originate or
of or
or leave the
state and we're always
looking to grow
that
number.
In the next
slide.
You'll see
that.
We're back to the sunset
route.
So.
I mentioned we
what the purpose of the
sunset route is and you'll
see there that
el Paso is
right in the key
point.
That.
Would merit the need
to service trains
so for decades the
company.
Refueled
and added fresh crews on the
trains that are going to the
east an
apostle.
So.
Following the room and we
needed to expand.
But instead
of.
Building more no
Paso.
We decided to build
a $400000000
facility here in some
that that Issa and
that was because
of a fuel
tax deduction
that. Was
something that that that
at then at that
point in time then
governor bill Richardson
of.
Help.
Offered so that we could locate
here.
So.
That deduction was
was granted in
2013.
And the next year
Senator that is I. intermodal
terminal.
Opened its doors.
We closed the facility is impossible
to do that.
And
it's been a game
changer for this
community you'll see
there the photo
on the left is
what.
The center that is a terminal
area looked like
before you Pacific
came into
town.
And are the surrounding
Jerry but could tell you because
he was
there.
It would probably look pretty
similar this
is been a game changer for the
state of New Mexico
and this is a state of
the art facility were
now train
stop they get
refueled and then
we have a an area
where.
Ruse come on
board to pick up
the train and take it over to
the east.
We continue to invest here
in in this
in this
terminal.
And looking at.
From the time that we
constructed to
date you Pacific is
probably invested about
$1000000000 in the state
that's private
capital.
So.
By all means
we are.
Passionate about
bringing new business here to
hear more from you live at
all on that
but we're always talking to
businesses whether we're
seeking them out or they
come to us saying I
need real service where can I
connect.
Show on the map and
we talked about
the benefits of coming here to
send that that is a I can tell
you all of our
customers all of
the potential
customers who come
looking to receive real
service.
Are all looking for stable
business environment
and this
fuel tax deduction
certainly illustrates that New
Mexico is a place
where you can do business
and and
grow.
So.
Decision to that we
just continue to work
with Jerry and other
other agencies to make sure
that we're constantly
attracting businesses here
to this
area.
So.
We've talked big
dollars we've talked about
development.
But the fact of the matter
is.
That doesn't matter
to our neighbors
in the center that is a
terminal.
Not if they
cannot participate
in that positive
benefit.
So as
someone who grew up along the
border. First
generation
Latina.
I'm very for I
very much understand
how.
Education is
the ticket for a family
to improve
its financial
situation.
So the company gave me an
opportunity to
to have
to find a
nonprofit group to give
to it would be a higher
impact award
and I knew exactly what I
was coming here
I didn't know what I was looking
for I talked to
many nonprofit
organizations by
the way there aren't many is
that are.
That are
actually.
Based here Sunland
park.
But I talked to a
lot of people and
then I spoke with
the New Mexico State
University foundation
and I learned about what
Dr Torrez was doing
here
and.
We looked at.
Partnering with the Oneonta
community college here in some of
the park and they came
to us with a wonderful
opportunity
where.
R. $300000
investment introduced
new
programs
that.
Provided training
for jobs that are
available.
In the sun but that is a
complex.
So I'm talking
about.
Courses like welding
becoming a CDL truck
driver.
Logistics
warehousing for
lift operator
all of these courses were available
in Los crucis.
And while a drive to Los
crucis.
When really mean much to you
or to me.
It means everything
to students
whose parents work and
have one car.
So we are eliminating
the time commitment
we're eliminating
the transportation
needs needs
to fund gas
and when you are a
family that
lives paycheck to
paycheck all of that
matters so we're
very proud of
the partnership with this
institution.
And I think that they should be commended
for thinking
about the needs of this
community
when it forms a new
programs.
So.
This school
here is
basically
building Southern
New Mexico's workforce
with home grown
talent.
And the thing about it is
they're not doing it alone
you've I've heard
Senator
Hamblen and
other Jared and others
talk about
working together
supporting each other
so you've heard about a lot about
collaboration
so. Going
on a community college could not do it
alone we stepped
up to the plate in addition to
that the the
investment to start the
program we
established a scholarship
fund with
$50000 to help
students who may
need certain
equipment to pursue
their their course
work.
But in addition to
that.
Jerry put Czecho through
Santa Theresa foundation
and the other companies here
are talking to high school
students planting
the seed about
there is a career
that pays well for
you these are
the options.
There are companies here that
are going to need your
talent they're gonna need
workers and they
pay pretty well
so. I
love the way the way
that we all collaborate I
mean it truly
takes a village I
believe
and
everybody here steps up to
the plate that's what I love about this
community that if I
need something have a question
I can pick up the phone and call
several people
and they'll help
me and so and
I'm always this
seat looking to to help
out in any way shape
or form that I can
so this
is probably.
The investment that I'm most proud
of I know we've invested a lot
in in economic
development but for
me this is the what's the
most powerful investment
that we've made in this
community.
So with that
I will turn it over to view the
Bethel from
ironhorse
resources.
Right good afternoon
to everyone is nice to be
here
my name is live at the more in my
work for I don't force
resources is
a short aligned hearing
center that is.
And I'm going to give a little story
about me so you know how
I got here to support for
I know our which is
a family owned company very
nice people.
Mr working us and also
developer blocking
to 0 with the largest
blocking in a few deals in
Nogales
Sonora.
And then I got hired by bill
Sanders talking
2005 for
more the realty company I
was very strong at that time
I have plans to do a CD
small city over here in isn't
that that as a result the mess
over there. But
plans change and they went
to a. So the
company in
and back in the
2018 I was
talking to white horse
I don't our system
are.
Thank.
I don't our move to
a.
Santa dress up back
in 2013.
They had a court syrup
transloading operation
at they moved over
here their plans were an
apostle and and and are
the skill what
is thank you what
what area.
And they.
They took over the operation
of the shoreline what
is a shoreline the probably gonna ask
railroad torment
we're basically that I let
parking of the
railroad let in these
cases union Pacific
they have 30 to 32000
miles of track I only have
11 and I have
the velop 6
miles in the last
4 years so
it seems like I would I don't
our
I convince the owners
to buy land they
acquire closed 1300
acres so here
and I have been developing C.
Zanne and
attracting new business to the
region
3 years ago
we complete home 3 years
ago our phase one cent
that that is a gateway rail park
which is a first slide that you see
over here a sign
that I put in the entrance of the
park.
Which was lots
from 5
acres
up to 20 acres
and all these element was
basically
basically done with the
intention
to attract new companies
that need to be avail
and we will serve over here
in the region.
Dependence is one of the
advantages that that that we have
over here of course we
have a great support
from the boarding
Association from will be
that from the county
when we start talking with the
with new prospects for the
region. And believe
me to the velop
a.
Right I a new rail
services thanks
a longer time and my
background is real state the
big shells facilities
construction and and
and land. It
takes a lot more time
to do it
then a real estate transaction
to build the shell would be
sent
so.
It we have over here
we start the on
2013 with the
operation we
have tend to
think workers over
here.
And we move around
3000 railcars for
here just to give you
an idea of the perspective
compare with you Pete
Mr chore line
but we have a very well
dedicated service
to our clients
we receive and
we're feel.
You get that you
Pacific provide
us with the service
I week
base so
every day we have the
levers for pick ups
from union Pacific and these
region. That
level of service you're not
going to find it and aposs.
I can guarantee you I
because I have clients that have
abrasions here in el Paso
one day to the
Max and we
take advantage on the
all the scent that that just up for
fantasy that has the
oversized
and and
overweight someone over
here so these guys
get benefit from this
the listening light is what
she shows the.
All the master plan that we
have for this area
is close to 1300
acres the
ones that you see on Jello over
there is
the.
Sole some more about but is what
we have available lofts
rail Sir.
As as I mentioned we have a
great service from union
Pacific in these
regions.
And and the next slide
is the.
Commodities that we handle over
here we have
a big a metal scrap
company Here rock
we blades corn
syrup feels
poking oil
feeds we've are
steel.
And and of course the
last part of my
presentation I'm going to talk about the
new clients that we're going to have in his
region and that
you're going to see at least one of
their. Facilities
under construction which
is the pepper mash and
audience.
So next slide you're gonna see the
effort grace with their travel
terminal
we have a couple customers over
here some of these
calls concert
goes to what is
and she while what and they
help to elaborate the
soft drinks coca
Cola whether
between other things
and of course we
send us well course for up
to a month
frankly which is the gummy
bears factory that is across
the
the border on something that I just I just
I don't even.
We should their expanding they
have another 3 facilities in
South of Qantas
plus that one in
order to enable that is
215000
square feet of
doubling the capacity improbably
Jareth already talk about it
his printers presentation
so we're excited about these
guys that are
really growing
and.
People still want
sweet a lot of candies
in.
M..
The next slide that I have is
the the win place stress
loading area.
They used to the transloading
of the wind blades in a
different location hi
bill this stress loading
area for these guys
4 G. Baca
almost 3 years
ago.
What they had before they they
used to do the a full train
which was 33 when
plates those plays
are usually
246
feet long
they're long and they have longer ones that
that probably around 40
more.
They used to it didn't around 10
days over here
in this chart that I bill for
them they can do it in one
day they stay still
in place as you see in the
picture and
they do the translating with 2
cranes the same
time they put it this
is very amazing to see that how
they do it then is a
precise
job.
And and we created the wrecked
axis from
Strauss so these guys
come from Santa
Fe to support entry
they turn
Strauss
left and they
they have a direct access on the
straws they don't have to go
inside the parking
create traffic over
there so that they don't need
to taxi base station
right next to
the.
The track in this
area. Some
of the clients over there is
a.
By the way on the wind blades
these guys to handle they
have around 1.3000000
square feet the water
just what they
manufacture the wind
blades TPI
is a company that 0
manufacture that
and they have all their clients
as well
but they usually send police
area up around 6060
to 70 we
blitz.
For week.
The next one is metal scrapping
Chirac transloading
areas.
These company that the chair
rock is from moderate
funded raise a name
they open a facility a little bit more
than 3 years ago south of
waters and
and.
When they start they supposed
to send product you do
Mexico in a little bit to the
US right now
is 100 percent of the
US they sent
out of fear sometimes
12 to 14 rail
cars
per week Center beans
and they sent a bunch
more as well
by track as
well.
New companies that want to start
their operation and ain't in
something just a.
One of them is we Santa Barbara
change when when
you give the tour to
the to the parkland well Sir
alright they have
is talent yesterday they
had a solid
100.
100 and seek the
condos
and 16
tax out of
120
these guys what they gonna do they
going to bring the pepper mash
from.
From the liberal family south
of a just as grand
this into what what.
They have around 700
Act areas other
of Chile
but they need to cut in the next
2.5 months and send that
over here
from here is going to be distributed
by rail
the few places in the
US they will thing
and the good testimony on this
one and this company
is I start talking
to them back in
October.
Covariates
last year.
Then we got together with Jerry
that that that we will be that we
start moving all the
incentives.
They purchase up the
land on
December.
And they start moving with the sign in
permits and all the staff
we have received a lot of
support from the county
Mr Misia's
Kristina some
big
up to speed up the the
permit process
it's amazing I have been in
these regions
scenes 2005
going back and forward
at and let me tell you the county
is in very very
good with the permit
process
before wasn't that
good right now I
congratulate those guys is is
great the services they have
I have seen
inspectors
doing inspections on
site as
late as 8 between 8 and
9:00 PM.
So is is amazing we really
appreciate what they have done for
for my client
they're ready start receiving
pepper mash 2 weeks
ago so you may see
some of the tracks so in
the the
transloading whether.
They do handle by
containers as well the pepper
mash from classes around
this they have a
Affleck's impact of those
inside a 20 footer
ocean container impressive
the way they put it they
sacked the pepper mash and
and US state do it
by tankers with that
ocean containers on the
folders. And
the speculation Senator receiving
around 12 loads
Bridget birthdate per week
based.
The it don't mean to cut you off
I do want to we've got 45 minutes
we still have 2 more folks
to speak and I do want to trying
to be respectful of everybody's
time if you want to
wrap it up can I give you that opportunity
wrap it up and the
next the next one that we
have is and I'm on this
is a new company they
already finished they're
designed to going to present that to
the to the county for review
and approval they want to
start with around
66000
square feet the state facility they
want to receive the
unions from to
while well 4
months of the year the rest from the
US they
gonna wash
it shop at
and packaging and send that
out by
boxcars Representative
boxcars.
We have we have been
building track without stop
for the last 4 years
and we're want to
continue to do that
that's about it so I
was a
little.
I thank you madam chair members
of the committee myself
and Star care we're
gonna go off the same presentation
here. Will
tag team this thing
moving forward
so on the first slide
again you
see.
Matt they're showing the power
plants
it doesn't show all the mining
operations but
used notice that there
are several
challenges there that
the Navajo Nation is
and that surrounding rural
area is really
dealing with.
As we make the transition
from it within the
energy sector.
But again you
see those power plants
there 4
corners power plant started in
1963
that was the first power plant
built. And
from there all these
other power plants then
were built and you you
develop an industry.
Of power plants and mining
operations there in the
area at its
height there in the 19
nineties we had
about
3600.
Direct jobs
at the end I'm number of these
mining operations
as well as these power
plants the
Navajos.
Numbered about 88
percent of those
direct jobs
in from that it was about 2 to
13 to 1 in terms of
indirect jobs in the
region. So
again you can see
the R. the
scope of the Energy
aspects and look for the
tribe to a royalties
door taxes
there were rental
or land leases that were
provided again
that help support the government
functions because the nation does
not have any type of
taxation
process on there it's
off of revenues
generated through
our natural resources
development.
Also these high paying
jobs from the sixties growing
forward bills
the Navajo nation's middle
class.
And many of those individuals
now have your 401
K.'s and they're enjoying
that but if you
look at a lot of these operations
those are generational.
You see
grand grand
children and great grand
children from those first
initial workers
now working at at these
operations so again
that's what I want you to
to really understand about
this map is
that there's a tremendous amount of
transitioning happening
on the within the 4
corners region especially
with the Navajo Nation as
it deals with
this energy transition
as you turn to the next
page.
The Navajo technical energy
company was
started as a result
of the Navajo
Nation taking over
part of 4 corners power
plant B.
H. P. which was one of the
major employers
sent 63
in the area they grouped up
to 1000 employees
at 1.running 3
mining operations there
they left the project
as a result in order to keep
4 corners power plant
going the Navajo
Nation then formed a company
called the Navajo technical
energy company
that company now
owns the mining
operation known as Navajo
mine and they supplied
coal to the 4 corners power
plant and Navajo
the Navajo Nation owns 7
percent of that power
plant also so again
you can see the kind of numbers
and and brought you
see that the
break out in terms of the
number of employees both at
Navajo mine and
4 corners power plant
up to 86 percent of
those employees are
Navajo. So
again I'm
not a tremendous
amount of
transitioning that's
happening and
this could be even more because
Arizona public service
company who manages
and owns a major
portion of the 4 corners power
plant has indicated
that they're going to be leaving that project
in 2031.
And so again they own
6 by approximately 68
percent of that
power plant so again we're
we're they're working
on.
Currencies sequestration
the nation's looking at that
whole process
if we're not successful
in doing that
that's another 600 jobs
that could be leaving us
in that region.
So if you turn the page
again.
You'll notice a circle
around the 4 corners
area.
You look at the nation you see
all the lines the
interstates
railroads.
You know a lot of these
places have commercial air
capabilities but
you look in that circle
there there is
no railroads.
There is no
interstate
there are no commercial
airlines there
is very weak
relative internet in that
area.
And so as we go through that
transition
we're having to deal
with those challenges as we
move forward.
And again it's a learning
process for each and
everyone of us because
again we're looking at how do
we make this change.
And we're looking at rail
as one of those Lynch
pins to really begin
to develop our
capabilities of moving for
with economic development
all morning you been
hearing.
What has happened here
in this rural
community.
With rail coming
in with a trans
loading
facility coming into
this
region.
We're looking at that same
opportunities up in the
northern portions of the
state of New Mexico.
Because as you can see
there that
MSA incorporates
all 4 corners
of. Those
4 states.
Everybody comes to
Farmington if
you go to Farmington
during a weekend
you will see New Mexico
Colorado
Arizona in
Utah plates
all that day
everybody shopping.
So giving a trans loading
facility and rail into
San Juan County
will help build that
aspect will bring
economic development
opportunities much
as it's done here Dona Ana
County. But
now all for the state of New
Mexico you would have
a location here in the southern
portion of the state
you would have another location
on the northwest side of the
state. So
with that I'll turn the next page over
to to Mr
starter.
Try to be there on the
table. Thank
you Mr Trujillo them
chair members of the committee
a pleasure to be with you here this
afternoon talk
about this really important a
project as Mr Trujillo is
indicated some
of the great needs and challenges
we have in our area And how
freight rail
would help to alleviate
those and and bring
as you saw the title The
presentation
would open the doors of economic
opportunity
in our area
the study
started back in
in February
of 2020 and I give
a credit to Mr
Trujillo when he was in his
role as the
force said for for for the
economic development
director role he helped
to facilitate
historic ammo
you between San Juan
County and the Navajo
Nation that it
never been accomplished
before to work
towards collaborating and
coordinating on bringing freight
rail from the I. 40
quorum court or the
Transcon line that runs from
LA to
to Chicago operated
by being a
staff.
Higher to that it's been 50
years and the making
of trying to get this project
off the ground and it's further
today than it's ever been
as a result of his efforts to
bring the 2 parties
together and and subsequently
we were the recipient
of a $2000000
US department of
transportation bill grant
that's funding the
study
and that's been significant to allow
us to fully
explore the
different important export
opportunities that our area could
take advantage of
lower transportation
costs that we
would see for our current manufacturers
that exist today
future manufactures
and other companies
that they would see the benefit
of the 4 corners
especially light of the fact that we
are losing
our core economic
base
extractive industries
coal fired power
generation
oil and gas were primarily
gas basin 85 percent
gas 15 percent
oil on that
that's providers some
challenges through the time through
time and this
would really help us
to further the
economic opportunities
recently a study was completed
in this is on the slide about the
project about The
New Mexico economic development department
the city Farmington.
It found that $20000000000
worth of of products
and projects.
I have been missed because
we can't check the box with
a site selector on
do you have freight rail
$20000000000
close to 15000
jobs that we missed out on so
that's that's why this is
so important to
our areas as you've
heard from the
previous presenters of how
rail in this area has
significantly enhanced
opportunities and southern
New Mexico that's what we're missing
out on in San
Juan County if you turn the page
to the project budget
slide
kind of covered most of those
and I do want to hit on the fact
that. In addition
to that the economic
benefits we would
also see
a reduction on a
freight traffic
you know a truck traffic
which would help to reduce accidents
would help to reduce
maintenance budgets due to the
the heavy load the truck
traffic puts on
our highways and county
roads and as
as mentioned previously
moving freight by rail rather
than trucks reduces greenhouse
gas emissions by 75
percent
in addition to the fact
that I think the
rail strike here recently
or the impending
restricted was fortunately
resolved it
brought to to folks
attention
that you know 40 percent of
our nation's freight
our products and goods as mentioned
previously the TV's we have in our
house are shipped
by freight rail
and and we were missing out
the 4 corners on the
ability to have lower priced
goods to have
the opportunities for on
new types of of economic
development.
As we continue through the
slide all
jump past the the
bill grant which are all
fully aware
of
why freight rail once again you
can see some of
the statistics that have been previously
mentioned
one ton of freight on
more than and
on one gallon of diesel
that's 480
miles
one ton of freight this move that
way
you know the greenhouse gas emissions
that are saved and then of course
the amount of freight that saved
shipped via freight
rail where we
stand today with this
project so when
we receive the grant we went out
to R. F. P. we were
fortunate to
bring on board not
just the the national.
L. engineering firm an international
firm HDR
engineering they brought
with them a great team of
consultants
former FRA
officials on this grants
my being.
Being there's oversight by the
federal railroad administration
also former BNSF
officials which is very helpful
in in the connection
point to the I. 40 corridor
other awesome with ultimately gonna have a
great influence on where
that that connection points going
to happen
and and with
that we we receive the grant and
and where we're at today
is we're about 50
percent complete with the
study hoping to have
it completed by
by the end of the year
and I think
Mr chair he is going to talk
about of what
we've done to date with
public
involvement in HSD
coordination with a lot of the
state quarters other
involved with this
project.
Thank you my.
We've we've we've done a
lot and we're beginning to do
a lot in terms of
getting information
to the public in particular
to the Navajo Nation
communities known as
chapters.
Again there's there
has to be a lot of
information provided
and a lot of education.
Because it in the
past.
Up. People
have not seen
a real benefits
at the nation's side from
industrial development.
Case in point uranium
development and that the the thing
the issues we have to deal with
today.
And looking at those types of
issues we're having
to go out make sure people
understand what we're doing
there is a lot
of scrutiny.
There is a lot of
mistrust
they're not short
are you telling the
truth and so
we're out there trying to be as
transparent as
possible and I'm
talking also from the Navajo Nation
side the government side
or wanted to make sure that
our constituents
understand what
is available to them
you can see the kind of public
involvement we got
Mr Henderson Mr
chi both Navajo
individuals who are helping
us in meeting
with that different chapters as
well as our own government
agencies working
with our separate chapters
are consulting with
them with the idea
of getting what we call
supporting resolutions
from each of those chapters
so they support this
effort and again
we want to make sure that all our
our our of our elected leaders
are are are
informed and they
understand
this aspect
because.
One thing we're doing or
trying to achieve just
as any other rural
community out there.
We're trying to bring our young
people back
home.
I'm the perfect case of
that I worked
hard.
I put my 3 kids through
college.
One 's got a
masters.
They did really
well.
One lives in Baltimore
Maryland.
The other one lives in Denver
Colorado.
Another one lives in Beaverton
Oregon.
And we have discussions
over the dinner table when they come
back.
And I say well you know if there's
opportunities here for you
guys at home.
And they look at me straight faces
said that what do we come back
to.
What.
And so again we're looking
at how do we begin to build
this aspect because the
Navajo Nation does a
tremendous job
educating that
you.
But they're all over the US
now.
Case in point the last census
that was done when I
was at the director back
in 20 in 1999
when the 2000 census came
out we had about
300000
Navajos
170.
On the reservation
130000 off
the reservation.
The day we got 400000
Navajos in the last
census about
170 still on the
reservation now
230000
off the reservation.
And so again how do we
bring our people back
so just like many rural
part this could
be that
that.
Beginning. For
us to bring those jobs
back home so that our young
people can come
back and enjoy
and be a part
of the governmental
system.
All right thank you Mr tree all
go ahead and bring us
home here we
we had a couple of Mr
Trujillo mention
public information meetings on this
next slide we
help for those meetings
thus far one
in Shiprock when Farmington
back in September most
recently in June held
a meeting in New Mexico high
school Crown
Point
Navajo technical university
hello more information provided
the last 2 were we
had some perspective routes which
I'll show you here in a bit
as well as what do the
import export opportunities
look like for our area those
are obviously questions that we
need to be able to find
answers to is also within the
day this feasibility
study
our hope is that it it shows
it is economically
feasible and viable
and then it it financially
can make sense as well
in that that obviously
needs to pencil out
if we're gonna be able to attract a short
line rail provided run
such a line for
us next slide
potential goods shipped
by rail it's it's somewhat
similar to what was previously
presented but but we have some
unique opportunities
with Navajo agricultural
products industry
it's 1 of the
largest tribally owned
farms in the nation
today they there are about
50 percent capacity
they could expand to double
the acreage that they have planted
part of the reason they haven't
is because they don't have access
to markets
outside of about 45 state
area and so if
if they had access to the
transcontinental rail
line now we're
providing access to all
those states across
that line but also the opportunity
for international export
which doesn't doesn't exist
today our recyclables
we've had a lot of interest in metal
recyclers
actually solar panel
recyclers that are interested
in our area but of course need
that the advantages the freight
rail would bring
food products
you know we we we
don't just want to ship out
of our directly
agriculture we like to value
add as was indicated with the
onion processing facility
here be great to have a
potato processing
field that's 1 of the primary
crops up it
that nappy
potato chip plant
those are some of the examples of what we
could be done to add
value to those products before
they're shipped out thus
creating jobs and and new
economic
activities Energy
will still consider intended to
export as mentor to
drugs as well as
manufactured goods
and that's the hope that we can bring
in take
advantage of that skill set that we
have you know with the
recent shut down to San Juan
generating station
you know we've got folks that are either
employed a
reprieve employed
but more than likely
under employed or
unemployed in this
would be the opportunity
to use that skill set those
those great to skills
that workforce fast
and put him back in the jobs
that they would would be
beneficial to them their families
and the overall economy
those are stature the export
opportunities inbound.
Minerals forced drugs would have
the access to the 4
corners if I
can't I'm we do have kind of a hard
stop because we've got a bus
of and I know that this committee is going to
want to ask questions for
do you mind wrapping it up
I'm happy to wrap it up okay
great all slide last slide
recommended the
routes there's 5 different
routes where we're working
with all of our stakeholders and
constituents to determine what are
the and what would be the
best route
to to come out from the I. 40
corridor which which
you can notice those all those
routes terminate one place
and that's already been determined
as the best of
placement for
transloading facility that would
be on the
Navajo agricultural products
industry land
they have available industrial
park space
also it's it's twice as
much to bring the rail line over the
bluffs across the river
that really looks like the
ideal spot to
terminate the line we do have a
website that's
where we get all the anybody
interested in the project can
go to get
information on it all of our
documents that's a repository
for everything we've done with this
project to date
uncertainly once
again thank you for the time
and I'm sure we'll talk more
about.
This projects and questions
we can answer for it thank
you thank you all of
you and I know
Representative Montoya Senator
Diamond you have questions
to ask I I
I am really grateful centers
and so Aaron's gonna take note
of that you
know understanding the economic
injustice that has
been in the inequity that's been
going on I'm
wondering
how like Raquel
you see like the southern part
being able to communicate with the northern
part because you know I've
I've you us as as legislators
is kind of like a board of directors we've
got communities that know exactly
what they need and
we are either in the way or we're
supporting what they need
in order to get the thing so that there
could communities can thrive
and so you
know there are some incredible opportunities
as you pointed out and
ways to be able to
bring our young people
back because that's something
specially in our rural communities we
see such this this
like this
it's so much part of our cultural fabric
of having families together and it's
heartbreaking when our kids
have to leave because there are no jobs for
them and so when we see
these efforts to try and create more
jobs training and everything
to keep our young people here
so that they don't have to leave
I feel it's a disservice that we are
doing to the residents of our
state by not by
not supporting those things
and so I'm very excited
about what you're doing and I think you know
Representative Montoya
you know has some suggestions and so
I'm gonna go ahead and turn it over to you
Sir to go ahead and
and start with your part and
we'll continue with the conversation
thank you madam chair.
Thank you guys for coming all the way up
here that's a bit of a track
from Farmington
but you're not the only ones who did it you
got to representative Allison
and representative Duncan and
myself made that trip
as well madam
chair one of things very interesting is
3 of us in this room
worked at the
power plants and and or the
coal mines in San Juan County
Arvin I actually work for our men
at 1.at
La Plata money
he was in charge of the blasting
crew and I was a explosives
blaster for about
19 years
and then representative Allison
worked with Representative Nelson at
Navajo coal
mine
until we both the
retired what about 10 years
ago. And
the and of course
representative Duncan
represents the community
probably move outside of
the reservation most
affected which is the the
town of
Kirkland.
Real quick Representative
I'm asked the the question about
the potential cost of a
project like this
and is my
my recollection we're looking
at this a couple years ago
we're topping out at about
$500000000 for the total
project
correct.
The one thing that to
that and I don't know if either one
of you could could talk
to this but the
population that
would be
affected
by a rail in San
Juan County one of the
things that folks don't really understand about
San Juan County since we
are. So
isolated
we are also the regional
shopping
hub for
the whole 4 corners region
as as a mystery
trio
mentioned.
A Utah of
Arizona Colorado and
then of course San Juan County.
All come to
to the region for for
everything they need
and I'm in my
mistaken one of you
correct me are we
of Representative
that that that region serves
what 300000 people
is that the right number.
Get it spot
300000 you're looking
at all the way to key into
Arizona.
All the way up to Blanding
in Moab Utah.
And then all the way up to the
silver 10 input goes to
springs Colorado
and then on New Mexico side all
the way
to.
The Apache reservation
to see. So
that whole big
area.
And then going
south all the way
down to about
sheep springs store
actually all
those all that bay area
everybody goes to Farmington
to shop.
So that to be honest as we've been
going through this transition
that's been the only thing that's really saved
us is frankly
the retail but
but even then the jobs
for local folks just has not been
there and that's what I like to
really talk about I I
really loved your
presentation
in part because I can see
exactly in a short period
of time what can
happen
and for
us.
The picture here that you had
to show the big circle was
between rail lines
but for everyone
understand for
interstate travel
we're talking all the way from my
25 all the
way over to what is what is it coming
out of.
Up through up
to Salt Lake down
to
and I certainly
is I. 70.
What we have all the way from
folks going from Salt Lake down
to Las Vegas
down to
to
Phoenix that's
the big hole that we've got
without
transportation and and the
the I'm our local
community has a good
workforce that is one thing we do
have something
that.
Mystery you mentioned
and that is
that that
the coal mines and power
plants I even
though they've had such a bad
reputation.
Over the last several years of
since we've been pushing for
energy transition
it really the one thing that it
did for the Navajo Nation
is it built
that middle
class.
Minus
those jobs.
Really destroying
that entire middle class there
really are no other
jobs the only other
jobs or government
jobs.
With.
Very similar situation what you have
right here which is a transloading
facility and a
short line rail
if we have having that in San
Juan County we do have
some things that are available to us
including we're going down this road of a
hydrogen power
plant which would
be on demand
electricity
one of the things Navajo Nation is
looking at doing potentially
is putting
a an
industrial park a very
similar to what you guys have
here that would
also have dedicated
electricity some of the manufacturers
need electricity that is
reliable that doesn't
shut off go
on go off but
its on demand and
it's their as they needed
so at
them and madam chair
I'm I'm gonna ask
a.
One is not not at
this point not something that we
need to do today.
I am going to ask for
this committee to
endorse of all things
not a not
a bill but a joint
resolution
for this to happen it's going to take
the federal government
we we there's gonna be a big part
first for New Mexico to step
in but the federal government's
going to need to
pick up a lot of this is this
really is Interstate
Commerce.
But all of the pieces
are there for this to be
a success the work
force the
products to be able to go
out and something
else that is that happened
that that.
Governor Richardson did here which
was a
a reduction of the price of
diesel fuel that
would be something that would happen
regardless because
since the
facility be located on the Navajo
reservation we run
into a do dual taxation
issue. And
Navajo Nation doesn't
tax.
Fuels not
the way we do so there would be an the
the very similar situation you would have
here would exist because
the Navajo Nation I
would not in the state of New
Mexico would not be charging
taxes on the fuels
so
I I really appreciate this
because.
As we're looking at 2031
that last power plant that last
coal power
plant could shut down
those remaining jobs which is
a quick which is the
equivalent of 40
percent of the
Navajo nation's entire
operating budget
that would be the same as if
the oil and gas industry
stopped providing us
today what is
providing.
And the right now
we have what a 3.$6000000000
projected
budget.
Of
surplus.
Navajo Nation is not working in a
surplus.
And
so
being able to provide
those jobs for
those workers those would all
be
Navajo a preference
jobs and it
would allow for not
only recapturing that
market of the
Navajo nation's of middle
class but greatly
increasing that with the opportunities
with the tree with a
industrial park so
I will get that you madam chair
but I I think that's something that
that we're gonna need to do
and just to let you know
this is really important.
At this point we have something we've not
had before which is we
have the governor
is a
supportive.
The Navajo Nation
president
is taking steps at
this point to do his part the
governor
actually the chief of
staff for the governor
in a meeting about 2 weeks ago
said that they would help
with there's a
$5000000 environmental
study these take place
and the the governor's
office said that they would make
sure that we that we were able
to get half of that from the state
of New Mexico
2.5000000.
If the Navajo Nation
would come in and just
last a week ago
today.
The meeting took place Navajo Nation
president he committed the
2.5000000.
So the Navajo nation's fully
invested in this.
And the reason
is in the
past.
All of the benefit
from Travis on the Navajo Nation
for the most part have
benefited cities like Farmington
all border towns.
Of all of the revenue
that is that is
made a threat that that goes of the
reservation ends up being
spent on drugs in the
border towns but
what this would allow is that
script to be flipped
and the Navajo Nation would
then be on every product
that is loaded and offloaded
would be able to capitalize
on revenue from the border
towns this is this
is the first real win win
win that I
think that has existed in talked
around our community and I think it's a
real opportunity thank you madam chair
thank you Representative and I
think
we've got some really exciting
opportunities here that would
would help and and
so I'm very very happy
about the the resolution so
Martin already knows about this
and so that brings
up an Senator Diamond we'll get to you
just just a second
that if you have less legislation
or resolutions that you want to be considered
for this communities and this committee's
endorsement they need to be
submitted fully
not draft my right
not draft that we they have
to be complete so those conversations
need to start now
that they need to be ready at
the end of our September meeting so
that we have from September to
October meeting to
review on the
last day of our committee meeting in
Santa Fe in October we
will vote to either approve
or not approve resolutions
or legislation that this
that this committee will
endorse okay
so I'm I'm looking forward to that
Representative Senator
Diamond that we have Senator
Shendo and then representative
Duncan thank you madam chair I
know we're pressed for time so I'm going to
have brief it's
it's really the American realligned
that position to this
country to be
the the worldwide
exporter that we are really like
the super power that became
but it's not lost on me that
part of my Senate district at spaceport
America and we are on the
forefront
of space travel
and we put all this investment
into something like this on the other side
of my Senate district over towards
Burke for example
they're asking for investments
back and write all the
original rate the originals
to share a travel
I was shocked to see this map
to see you know we.
