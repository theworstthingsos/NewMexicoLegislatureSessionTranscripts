then sharing that with the

will do my best to keep us on track
and on time if it looks like a
discussion or questions going off

this committee I recognize that
there is a time commitment and the distance
that you get to travel
and and I appreciate your
commitment to your particular
areas in your constituents and I'm
grateful for your feedback
and so today
we first start off with
the economic impact of the
restaurant industry and workforce
development needs so
I think we have our speakers
here today if you don't mind
had not up to the
the table so that we can do
this we have
Genevieve words who's a culinary
arts instructor from Deming high
school we have
Kristin Thompson who's director of
government affairs from The New Mexico
restaurant association
and Carol Wright the chief executive
officer of The New Mexico
restaurant association
and it's really interesting what I've been
listening to
on and PR this week
is a long series
about tipping in the restaurant
industry and this morning
as I was driving here today
talking about in different countries
how tipping in the service
industry is not
necessarily something that is part
of the culture wars in
the United States we do and
so it's very
interesting to hear about that and
just to hear about the changes
and we know that post
comment you know during
the during the pandemic impose
comment that there are restaurants
and service
industry have had to adapt
and be very flexible me very
creative and
so I'm very grateful for you to
see to be here with us today and
I'm gonna go ahead and let you all
start with your presentation and thank
you again for being here and thank you
to the students we appreciate
you and I are grateful
that you're part of this
today.
So to speak you will need to
push the little talking person on the
microphone I do
have control over the mikes if we have
more than one going at a
time in a particular location will
get feedback
so you might see
the the little red light is what
tells you that your mind is
hot
otherwise you so
just watch that if you're gonna speak you might
need to turn your back on solid to
go ahead and go Chris it looks like you're gonna talk
first.
I madam chair thank you
so much for having us I
am actually going to
have Genevieve
worked 6
did I say that correctly to
talk about pro start
the impact in this community
specifically and
the that so the pro
star program
these are the students back here
that prepared
all of this
food
and if you haven't had the muffins
yet.
Eat them they're so
good thank
you.
My name is Jenna the words I am the
instructor at doing high school
for prostart
prostart is a is
sponsored by the national restaurant
industry.
We
are.
I don't remember how many
strong lots of
prostart schools in New Mexico I think
we're up to 34.
What we 3838
now. Yeah
1800
students.
I'm I'm pretty sure that
all of you in this room
we're in you know
involved in a restaurant at some point
in your life probably had a restaurant
job when you were
kids
my first my
first agriculture job was 9
years old I was a
a pipe starter on a
farm and
so I've been in you know
agriculture my whole life
in the restaurant industry my whole
life these kids
get a little gamut of
everything they do catering
they cook for our football
team every Friday
which recently got a food
truck.
So they're going to be having a
food truck we're gonna be serving
food to our
students
we're going to do events and things like
that but prostart is a great
program I
started doing high school this is my
tenth year just starting my
tenth
year.
We've been to
nationals
2 times
we've been in the top
3.
Every time we've competed except
one which was really
upsetting but it's
okay.
But those kids that have gone on to go
to nationals and things like
that. They've
had some real great experiences
I took a
group of my
prostart team last
year we went to a
thing in Florida called cook
around the world and
some of those teams they were really
impressed by my kids
and they're like are you kidding program
or where Prosser yeah
and it makes a
difference
I can take them anywhere they can
set up a catering all by
themselves they can do all the
food they can do everything by
themselves so it's a great
program great
leadership program builds
leaders and when we
had the pandemic here demi
was a red zone for a
year we don't have school
for a whole year
and a lot of my kids were running the
restaurants here because the adults
brigade they were gone
are they were sick
so these kids how to run the restaurants
and I had probably
9 kids.
As managers in
some of these restaurants
and it was tough because they
were thrown into a very
adult position
very quickly without any
warning you know and
so we were going back
and forth on the phones and how do you
set up a schedule agency and what I
do and how do we do maintenance and how
we it also we
we kind of filtered through that
but it's an amazing
amazing program.
You know I know the state's really crazy
about stem
but I'll tell you they're all those
engineers you 3 times a
day and the
film filmmakers the 3
times a day and
you know spaceport people eat 3
times a day to
so so you
know funding is one of
those things that we
we really need cause
for programs like this it affects
a lot of people I mean
that that's one of our biggest industry
in New Mexico's is
food.
So thank you for
having us it's been great to
be here there's plenty of food
so you all you
don't.
First you
are.
Yes if you can stay
because I've got some questions I think the
committee would like to if you don't
mind Kristin you're
you're thanks
madam chair members of the
committee thank you so
much for having us
today
Genevieve it is
one of our all stars
and we're so
proud to feature them
the prostart program
is.
Is as as you heard
a career and technical
education or a
program in the
state
and as I
would like to quote
the I'm gonna forget her
name but the woman from Albuquerque
public schools she called a
career connected learning
and I think that
really puts a fine
point on
it
okay so I was going
to work off of a presentation
that is video
so I may see some things
that are not on your sheets that
would be pointing to
pictures that
I have.
Just bear with
me I say that
because the first one is who's
hungry
showing all of the dishes
from
from New Mexico that are
unique to New Mexico so
let me paint you a
picture.
Well.
I'll tell you who's hungry are
tourists
are.
Visitors come to New Mexico
I'm sorry.
Read off of this
visitors come to New Mexico
for the food
not only are the the Chile
capital of the world but we're
also home to the green Chile
cheeseburger trail
and the breakfast burrito by
way and
no those are not inventions
of The New Mexico restaurant
association
actually from the tourism
department.
Of the well these
things are are fun to try
the culinary heritage of New
Mexico is known for being
diverse and deeply
rooted in our state's
history and
culture.
It's a fusion of native
American Spanish Mexican
and American influences
that is both distinctive
and an important what
part of what of
what attracts tourists
in their wallets to
our state
24 percent of
visitor spending
24 percent of visitor
spending in our state
as we recovering from
recovering from COVID
was spent on food and
beverage.
All right
in addition to driving
tourism restaurants are
also driving force in New
Mexico's economy
the food service industry
creates thousands of
jobs supports
career growth and
plays a vital role in
every community across the
state we just
heard.
In fiscal
year.
2023 there
were 30 800
just over 30 800
eating and drinking place
locations
that is a federal
statistic
it drove
the food services
industry
drove 5.$3000000000
in sales.
Created just over
90000
jobs that
was a in
2022 the
latest data available
and is
makes up 11 percent
of the employment in New
Mexico
1.forces
a lot of numbers that's why it's on
your sheet.
1.4 6000000000
and Max.
Matched taxable
gross receipts
which was a new 1 for
me
so this
is data from the
economic from
EDD
which they they determine
match taxable growth
receipts to be
the best data to show
economic activity in the
state
but that number 1.4
6000000006
percent of the
total
MTG arcs it's hard
to say match taxable
gross receipts for New
Mexico
it's the 6
largest to this industry
is the sixth largest contributor
to the economy
in New Mexico
and it is
a 12 percent
increase that amount is
a 12 percent increase over
the previous year obviously
these are still recovery years
but 12 percent
growth.
I am a data
nerd in this was what I was
going to put up
but
this
sheet
is all again
federal
data
and it's from
the portal
on the economic
development
website if you want to
go and compare different
industries that industry the
top it looks like 123
fourths 10 industry
in the state you can
actually pull this data for all of
them
and it's
fun.
The other fun thing about this
data is that the census
bureau and the bureau of
labor statistics
categorize this industry
differently so you'll
probably hear we are
see if you're looking at
data the is
the food service
industry
restaurants
hospitality
leisure.
These are all words for the same
industry so when
you're looking at this it actually
shows
that the
leisure in industry which
is not how.
The state
categorizes.
But the restaurant and food
services industry makes
up about 75
percent of the numbers you see on this
page.
You can see from
this data a very big
drop in employment during
the pandemic when you
look at this and compare it
to other
industries
it is that dip
looks very different
there's obviously a flat
line item number of
them.
It.
Unfortunately with
this graph does not show
you is that more
workers are needed
the industry is growing at
a rate faster than the
employment rate
and that is that 12
percent number that growth in
the industry compared
to 6 percent in
employment.
Hey
so I'm gonna just
skip to the workforce
development part of
this
you have obviously
I've I've been in most of the meetings
you have heard many
presentations on
workforce issues
so I'm gonna keep
this
specific to
that the issues that are
very unique to the restaurant
hospitality
industry
obviously it labor shortages
which you guys have heard a lot
about have
been an issue for
restaurants
well they've always been an issue for
restaurants making
it difficult to to
find and hire qualified
staff.
Help that was a period
sorry leave
labor shortages of always
been an issue.
A pandemic related
closures and unemployment
benefits cost the industry
most of our skilled
workers and they are
not coming
back.
So much sought refuge
in industry with less
fluctuation
and others have opted out of
employment all together
the industry starting
fresh with a pool
of applicants with little
to no job
experience.
There are big training and
skills gaps by
far the biggest issues are members
are experiencing in the new
labor pool is a lack of
soft skills
cannot overstate
yes.
It while many training
programs are focused
on technical skills
soft skills are needed to be
successful in restaurants
in both the front and the back of
the house
basics like listening in
conveying information
team work problem
solving adaptability
time management
cultural sensitivity
and punctuality are
what most of our new hires
need to be trained
for
these days.
Actually if you think about
pandemic.
And how kids
were learning in front of a computer
and not with other
people.
Work life balance
so I'm gonna go into sort of some of the
issues the work for work life
balance the restaurant industry
industry often demands long
hours including
evenings and weekends
not everyone has the flexibility
to work odd hours with
further lament which further
limits our pool of
applicants
COVID related health and
safety concerns
concerns still haunt the
industry and workers
must adapt to new safety
protocols.
And you've probably seen those when you
done now.
But this
has led to
high employee turnover
and then finally there
issues like harassment and
discrimination that need to be
addressed addressed immediately
and most restaurants do not
have an HR
department
that which means training for
owners and managers is
paramount to improving
workforce culture within the
industry
and finally there's also the perceived
job instability and that was
you know the sudden
dramatic if you
look at it closure
of you know
of
restaurants
immediately we're just an
entire workforce was laid
off it's hard it's hard
to get over that
perception that
this won't
ever happen
again.
And finally career advancement
opportunities need to be better
articulated across the
industry restaurants
provide good jobs
particularly in
rural communities.
But people students
you know often don't
consider the industry
beyond serving
or prep cooking
in addition to frontline
workers restaurants rely
on accountants 8
chefs marketers
and industry consultants to
grow it's a good
place to start these
jobs usually go to
people within the and
with restaurant industry
experience.
All right we get into the good
stuff. I'm
also trying to watch the
time.
So what is the restaurant
association doing
that's a lot of problems what are we
doing to to
overcome this
well The
New Mexico restaurant association
is probably best known for
offerings the serve safe
program of
programs that include food
handling alcohol
service if anyone here has worked
in the industry of
alcohol service food
safety for managers
this also includes
these important programs like
sexual harassment
prevention and
understanding unconscious
bias training for restaurants
targeted specifically at owners
and managers so
they're quick to deal with
situations
we also just launched a
series of online
modules that restaurants
can use to train
employees that
focus not only on the demands
of the job but on those
soft skills like
handling a difficult
customer addressing
real life workplace
situations like active
shooter training
and individualized sexual
harassment prevention
training I don't mean to
highlight bad
things
but this is the
reality when you are
working with the public
when you're not safe
behind locked
doors
you all know because you also work
in the
public.
But that is that is stuff that
we are.
Providing to
restaurant owners managers and
employees
and finally and I'm all
right. This
is in the middle of the first
class of 35
employees enrolled in our
hospitality business
school which is aimed
at employees looking to move
up.
To master the skills of
organizational leadership
people management and
business finance
you've heard about the prostart program
and I'm just going to get to
that
now.
This is a program of
the hospitality industry
education foundation
which is connected
to the restaurant
association
but provides
us
all of our education
and training programs
that are focused not just on
membership but outside the
organization focused
on the hospitality industry
specifically
prostart is a nationally
recognized 2 year
culinary and business
curriculum for use
in high schools it's
being used in all 50
states of the
hospitality industry
education fund prostart
program
offers high school students a
comprehensive
career and technical education
are us we will just continue to
call it can your
career current enacted
learning.
That provides knowledge and
training in restaurant
and hospitality
management.
In New Mexico the program
is in what we heard 38 high
schools I've got 40
but I will go
30.
And serves about
1800 schools
it R. 1800
students in New
Mexico
every single
year of
their schools with waiting
lists
with waiting lists with dozens
and even hundreds of
kids wanting to be
enrolled in the
program.
Students that complete
the program our
hospitality career
ready and have credits
that can be transferred into 2
year or 4 year culinary
programs in community
college or in
universities in the
state I'm gonna make a plug
here the
NMAA you culinary
program just
because received
a rule to remember
the amount that's a big federal
grant yeah
I don't
okay
we just found
out
it but
to train more
teachers
in culinary
arts
this is really a
Development broke program
for.
Not just college professors
the high school students and the
woman that runs that just
told us that 75
percent of their first
class our prostart
teachers in our
public
schools.
The positive outcomes
and I I
I've Senator
Diamond
really made probably
the best case for C.
T. E. that I've heard and this was
in one of our
other.
One of our of one of the other
meetings
so I'm not going to go over
and over and over but it
is the positive
outcomes really for any
CTE and for this program
specifically
is increased graduation
rates
again over the weekend think New
Mexico just put out a
study
that shows new
data that
shows that career
connected learning programs
like pro start.
Students enrolled in those programs
graduate at a rate
of 90
percent.
And that
cannot be overstated
and on us again
Senator Diamond I think
when you were talking about your
brother that
was powerful
and that was real so I'm
not going to continue
to code health.
That wrote the economic
impact as a case in Deming
students have the opportunity to
provide jobs and remain in their
communities
if they so choose
this helps boost the local
economy.
And also the the
opportunity for increased
entrepreneurship a
lot of students enrolled in
prostart
not only graduate with the skills
and and culinary arts
as well as management
and they go on to start their
own
businesses.
Personal development
I think you made the best
case here but but
that students going through the
program they've shown increase
confidence in all areas of
their lives
and they also learn team work
without the dreaded.
Rupe homework
exercise
and then this picture
that is on
your I
think this one printed out
is actually from
Carlsbad
the they took second place
at the Nash at the statewide
competition
tells took
first with
their new or the
other.
Cloudcroft.
Stay in management and
management first
yes.
So.
What we have
learned not
just this committee
hearing but also what we have
learned through
a number of
up state
listening tour is except
for it is that the current workforce
development
programs
that are funded by the state or
not meeting the
needs of the hospitality
industry
it is not
on the we what
priorities
the work I'm gonna forget
that but that seemed workforce investment
opportunity act
which is a lot of federal money that
comes into the state this
is not on their priorities
and it was actually Senator
crea Hemphill
Correa Hemphill
called out to
the the head
of workforce
development.
And spoke
again passionately
about the fact
that there are that
that the hospitality industry
provides good
jobs it
allows people to stay in
their community
and nothing was
on the list
for the sixth largest
industry in the state
nothing.
Well the the federal
recovery grant
programs
called out.
Specifically funding
for the hospitality
industry none was
dedicated at the state
level.
And few communities that we
know of other than
Los crucis.
Designated funding specifically
to help workforce
and help this
industry.
In recovery.
Leaders labor shortages
are expected to be a multi your
challenge if there
isn't a focused and
funded strategy
restaurants another tourism
industry need
help building a
sustainable workforce
pipeline
prostart is supported
in multiple states
because it is proven
it is a proven successful
curriculum that
builds the talent pool in the
hospitality industry
boost graduation rates
and allows students to develop
careers in their own
communities and I'm just
going to finish with a quote from
the article this weekend about
the.
The data
I think I skipped one
I'm sorry
nope that was
it.
But that was in the
article this weekend
and that is that the US department
of education found
that New Mexico high school students
who take at least 2
CTE or career connected
learning courses
in a program area
graduated with rates above
90 percent
of with in CTE
students can explore everything
from health care and film
to teaching journalism and
culinary arts
while gaining skills
relevant to their home
and work lives
so we put the
money amount on there but
we are asking and we hope
to come to the legislature
with the proposal
for funding for the
prostart program so that
we can expand this
into
more
into more high schools get
students off that
that waiting list
and get more teachers
into the
program at
NMSU
get that career development
not only for students but for the
teachers thank
you.
Madam chair members of the
committee thank you so much
for having us
I'm I'm really here just to
hit cleanup and
basically answer
questions but I will
say you know
part of the situation is
that we don't have the
pipeline.
Yet.
We have access to
restaurants you know
we have a verse
6000
to 10000 emails that we
send out these are
restaurant operators restaurant
managers restaurant
owners
but we don't have them set
up.
To take these prostart
students because
we're a small staff we have 5
people on our staff
and so we we just
can't make that
connection yet and so part
of the money we're asking for
would be to make that
connection to be sure that we're
in those high schools and
what I love about
prostart is it's
in small
communities.
It's in those you know
every community out
there that.
That wants to have a
great.
Graduation rates and
other things for their students
and you know not every
student will
graduate and go into
our industry we totally
understand that but
it's like you know how many
of you started out in
restaurants is one quarter of
all Americans started out
their careers in restaurants
and we're very proud of
that we don't expect
everybody to stay in the restaurant
industry but you
learn things in the restaurant
industry that you will use the
rest of your life
that's those soft skills that's
the soft skills that we're we're
constantly going back to our high
schools and saying why can't you teach
this why can't she teaches and they
can't because
for one reason or another
we teach that
we take these
students and teach them
those soft skills of
looking somebody in the eye when
they're talking to them putting
down their phones.
And so you
know again we're very
proud of those first jobs that
we offer people
I didn't I didn't look at you for
that
reason.
So so I just want
to say we're so proud of the program
I mean is there
any other program in New
Mexico that
has.
38 high schools
and 1800
students I will tell
you Sandia high school has
200 students in their
program and their prostart
program and they have 200
students on a waiting
list and that's
how many of these
programs
are you know the kids
want into them they
want a reason to learn
they want a reason
to make
algebra work
right and we we all do algebra
everyday but we don't
know that.
Until you get into
you know a food costing
on the menu and
they do that they they
actually figure
out of food cost on the
menu. They
figure out finance
financials you know there's
things in this program
that they it's it's a
rigorous program and they
learn. By
doing. And
so
I just want to get make a
huge plug for this and
say we've never asked
for this kind of money before
for this program and hope
that that you all can
support that thank
you.
Thank you 3 so much
for for this and I
think all of us think about the different
opportunities we've had
to enjoy
the amazing food and good
service and we know that when we don't
get that service we know whether or not
we're going to go back to that place of
business and
and for many of us
we we those those
are things that matter as part of the whole
experience I'm really grateful for the
prostart program
I often think of all of
they are they which
has a culinary program in Los
crucis and
those students have
cooked meals for local
charitable organizations and
events and very
grateful for that
support but also just
those experiences of being able
to interact with young
people who are really working
hard to
find their place in this world
that fits that works for
them and that also
feeds their their imagination
and and their passion so I'm really
grateful for the prostart
program we have
Representative Armstrong Representative
little we have
Representative Senator
Diamond Brantley kasa
Representative Lujan.
Thank you
Hey.
Okay.
Okay before as
I'm writing this down
there is a question about the guest
wifi password and I think
Martin and
Ian were helping find
that we do have it will pass
it around here
but if we can get that
password I think
it's written down on a piece of
paper.
Okay might be under no pets but
will pass it around as
well
Representative Alcon
all right so I have
Representative Armstrong and
and then Representative little
I do want to be cognisant of
time and
so if you will be
really direct with your questions that's
great if there are
any questions that you have come
up later remember
Aaron will be really good about getting
those 2 are speaker so
Representative Armstrong your
first thank you madam chair
and thank you for your presentation
welcome to New
Mexico Kristen
nice to see you again
from Moscow when I met
we met Los crucis
so you know ultimately what I
talk about his life
skills.
In on this this program
sounds like it it teaches
life skills and
the teaching life skills is
something when you learn it you can never
fall. Those never
go away no one can take
those away from you will learn for the
rest of your life I
learned I'm still sometimes
the hard way unfortunately but that
is what it
is
so ultimately my
one of my questions is who
funds pro start
now and
is it done through
PED.
So I will say that
the individual schools
get money from the
Perkins requests
and you can correct me on
if I say anything wrong
here
The New Mexico restaurant
association that
administers the program
in the schools
we do teacher training we
do a boot camp
for the students
before our competition
and then we do a competition
and we get about
$26000
from the national restaurant
association to do that
and the money we would be asking for
is is to
build that pipeline and
help the schools and actually
get out to the schools so
that we can help the teachers
because you know a lot of the
teachers are very new in this
some of them came from home mac
and they don't know anything about
running restaurants and they're very
intimidated by the
program
and so we want we
want them to get
comfortable we like to take
some of the
the teachers the the who
have been in the program for a while
and match them up and
mentor these
other.
Newer teachers
and so those are
some of the things that we we
need the additional
money for but $26000
is what we get they get
money from Perkins you can talk
more about how you get
money.
This.
This year we will be getting any money
for Perkins because I think it's going
to medical
in our area
but we have gotten Perkins before
when I first started doing high
school I started
in a very
Becky home Mekhi
kitchen
it was pink and blue if that
gives you any idea when it was
built.
And immediately
I went to work and we got a
$60000 grant
and I upgraded that whole kitchen
my husband was the building
trades teacher at the time
at doing high school
and during the summer they
handed me the keys the first day
of summer and we just tore
up the whole room I
was torn up and
we I bought a
reach in refrigerators
stainless steel tables
there anything that we could do to
upgrade it to be more commercial
looking.
And get it out of that home EC
and there's nothing wrong with the whole mix
thing but I'm gonna tell you a lot
of these teachers that they're talking
about our teachers
that have been teaching home EC for really
long time facts
programs and things like that which
are great but it's not
restaurant ready they're not
restaurant ready and we I
I'm mentor couple of teachers
that just really
struggle with the whole idea
of you know putting on
a catering and having kids
do that and you know
teaching in the soft skills and all
the things that they
need.
But you have to do that and
we got a Perkins grant that's what I
did with that I mean I just
maxed out that kitchen as much
as I could and then
after we built our new building
all of that equipment with
us so we built
into the because I designed the kitchen
that we're currently in
we just designed
it into that
kitchen and it's been great
having all that commercial equipment
really changed the game for us
we went from a really
small program that could do
a couple of things to
you know our team 600
for football banquets and things like
that so it
changes the game the those
monies change the game a
lot and that that
pipeline is important too
because.
You know just getting these kids just
getting them to want to stay in
the industry is tough.
Especially after COVID
you know everybody's kind of running scared
from everything so
it's it's been really tough to
encourage them I've had a couple of
kids go from here
to the CIA
in San Antonio
I have to running
big hotels
in Austin.
Doing a great job
one of my girls went to
New York
and they're doing great things
she's working for a TV now in
Texas making more money than
I did after 20 years of teaching
so you know it's kind of
it's kind of a cool thing to see those kids
go on and and really succeed
and she's been really integral
in her community these
kids learn to go
into their communities and make them better
and I tell you can leave ME
leave ME not taking to see I'll
take anywhere you want to go we'll
go see schools make yourself
better and come back and make a community
better
and that's one of the things we try to teach
them because you know small
towns they need to
shut the arm I mean
there's a lot of things going on
in some of these little communities
that prostart is one
of those programs any CTE
I'm not I'm gonna put
CTE all of
these these kids learn
things in CTE programs
that don't learn
in court.
Having to work on a team having
to to push
through you know just
you know the kids so Mister tidy
stand on your feet 14 hours a
day is to just do it
and when you have a catering you do it
and you do dishes for 3:00 hours
after and you and you're going
to do it again in 3 days so
smile and everybody
be happy
but these programs are amazing
prostart is amazing
program I
would love to see it in every high
school and I would
love to see as many kids involved
in it is possible is
it really teaches them something you know
food is that that
language that we all
speak great and
and that's one of the things that I
think is super
important enough to connect
those cultures of.
And to get them where you
know nourishing someone
is is something else
and and they learn that they learn
that especially they tell
me you turn this into food
stops agency works on like
sorry in.
You're gonna learn that food and that's all there is
to all thank you for
that thank you miss words I
I appreciate your passion
for sure I don't think that you will
provide a
much bigger advocate
than myself for
CTE
construction
food
electrical whatever it
is that
we need to give kids choices and
this is a great choice
one of the things I one of the other
question I had is after
if this is taught in high school after
high school do they have some kind of
certificate there where they
can go out and be some
kind of a server or
or go into the
industry.
I just we just
recently us certified
29 kids and serve
safe handler
so that that
that's the basis that they need for
foods service in New
Mexico but my
level 2 kids will
stir provide
chair the
lead with that and
if they do the test both years to
learn leave with a certificate of
achievement and that
gives some out of about 16
hours in their next
level if they go to culinary school
hospitality the good to
clip out of about 16 hours
a day of school that's a
lot and
and so for them it's very
valuable
you know I I tell him all the time if
you walk out with a
certificate of
that says you're safer
your suppressor safe chair
they're going to pick you over anybody
else because I don't have to waste any
time you're already
ready to go thank
and yeah I I thank you
madam chair and and I appreciate
that answer so I'm just trying
to you know get my arms around it
because a several of us
in here said on the
legislative finance committee
and we need to
you know figure out how we
can work this out
if we could if it's doable
and and try to push this
forward because it would be something that I
would like to push
across the only thing
I wish you had in your your
little presentation is across
New Mexico
where are those 40
schools I'd
like to see that because
you know rural New Mexico
is what I represent
and I that bulletin
has it but I wouldn't
guarantee it so I'm just
curious if that
if you can reach out to
us via air and
to give us a map of
where those 40 schools are
and I appreciate
all that you do I just
wanted to touch really
quick Carol
on if if you
want to
because we're talking about
employment we're talking about
economic development we're talking
about industry we're talking about
growing New Mexico.
What are some of the negative
things
that.
Get pushed in the legislature
that could possibly affect
the food service
negatively just if you could
just touch on you know
just a couple just
because we need to have
everyone understand
what those are what those issues are
thank you madam chair.
Sure and I will you know I
will say
that.
Passing the sick leave law
in the middle of the pandemic was
very difficult for
restaurants
and and it
comes back to the fact that they
don't have HR
departments these
are mom and pops
trying to figure out how to
make pay roll and it's
not easy in the restaurant industry
with with tip wages and
other things you can get
it wrong 0
different ways you know
I I one time
in a committee like this
I brought you know here's
the the stack of
papers that is the
federal law
on of
payroll and then here's
what we're doing in New Mexico
and it's very hard for some
of the small mom and pop
places to keep up
with all of these things we're
actually having another
training on the sick
leave law in
October because we're
getting so many calls
from people that are not
understanding didn't
understand how
to
implemented in the first
place and we had
many trainings
back in July when they
finally.
They finally got the
rules out we
have many trainings then and then
we have continued to have
trainings but this one in
October you know you would think they
would know this by now
but they don't and so
we're we're going to do that
and of course the paid family
medical leave will be another one
of those things that the
small businesses of all have
a very hard time
rolling out and and
dealing with in
their.
In their restaurants I mean if you think
about it of somebody leaves
for a 12
weeks
from your restaurant you have
to replace that person you
you can't run your business
you know and I think of our
office right in
my office if somebody's out
for 12 weeks yes somebody
has to do their job but
there's some of that that just doesn't get
done in a restaurant there's
nothing that can't get done
so you have to replace them
and then when they come back you've got
them replaced so what do you do with
that person so it's
I mean there's things that we have to
think about in in
that law in particular
that we haven't
we haven't been at the
table and we would
appreciate being at the table
for that so and
then the other thing is minimum
wage
you know restaurants.
Where the last bastion
and I've said this many times
of service you
do not go in any other
business to this day
and get service
we're checking out our
own food
I'm like I didn't sign up
for this right
but in restaurants you get
greeted at the door
and you know if everything's
going right do you get
service from every end of
this.
If you think about it restaurants are
very unique
in that we
bring in rob product so
we're a manufacturing
business because
we manufacture that
into regular
product and then we sell
that so we have a whole
retail outlet and a whole
manufacturing outlet
in one building that's
not usual.
And you're asking these mom and
pops to run that kind
of a business and
then on top of that put more
burdens on them and so
that's you know I
thank you for the question
and.
Thank you madam chair thank you so much
for the the
the information
the 2 other things at
environmental do you have any
issues with environmental
inspections or anything like that is
there anything that we need to fix
at that level
for in a restaurant inspections
things like that is there
any issues getting a
license at
the state of New Mexico
and then as far as
catering goes do you all do
the destination source
taxing on
that or
are you supposed to be doing it or
who the hell knows I'm sure we're
supposed to be doing it but I don't
know if it's
getting done
correctly
that's one of the.
The least things that people are
thinking about honestly
and madam
chair members of the committee you
know as.
Did the other part of your question
please. Was
a enlighten
inspections and and licensing
getting a license to do business
in the state of New Mexico
so I want to say that you
know great things about
the state environmental
Department they
are fabulous they do
a great job they
they are mostly
about training
eventually if somebody
doesn't listen to their
training they will
shut them down and they will take
steps but
is that.
Can I see something really quick yeah
if I actually just
reminded committee and and
and our panelists I do want
to try and wrap this up around 1130
so I can keep your your
answers directly to the
question that would be great
like she says when somebody's
not there to do their job our
local office
here in Deming had to shut down
for a little bit because I guess
someone had a baby and
she was gone so we were working
through Silvercity well
Silvercity is trying to
service tier
C.
adamis
us you know
and it's just it was just
packed up so we couldn't get a
license for a long
time for a food truck I mean we had a
hat since summer so
it's it's 1 of those things that is is
that it is impactful
and and it you know and it's growing
all the time I think we have food
trucks and every like you wouldn't believe all
of a sudden just like everybody's
got a food business I don't know how
they're all license I don't know that
they are a license
you know also so sometimes
I think that's 1 of the glitches
that the it's really tough
you get in your big
towns like Albuquerque in
places like that where there's a
lot of food inspectors in a lot
of guys come round
there's not here we have
1 they come shows over
city and he does everyone
so that that's kind of a tough
thing okay thank you for
that thank you I just wanted to
bring it to the the legislature's
a top of mind
that it doesn't work the
same in rural New Mexico
as it does in Albuquerque and Santa Fe thank
you madam chair thank you for the time thank
you thank you Representative little
and then Senator Diamond
rally.
Thank you madam chair and
thank you for The presentation this morning
for you all just take me
back
growing up in a public
the public centrally
penthouse we
get this training very
young very early
for all of the feast days
weddings baptism all's
all these other family
and the community gathering
had no idea about the soft
skills that we were gaining at that
time and just how vital they
are to our
our make up as we
go forward in life
listening team we're building
find a problem solving
and attendance timeliness
in attendance because
and I'm
finding that that
the environment has changed
over time
and
at those challenges you
described
are are very real
so my question madam chair
goes to the
goes to the
other side of the of
this opportunity
I'm wondering
if you would tell me
what you mentioned it before
but whoever can
respond to this please
as the
opportunities for
partnerships with the
owners of
these businesses
and if those
relationships are
established what role do they
play in the
community.
And with the
students.
But thank you
Representative
Madam chair representative
little
right now
it is
we we work with our
owners and encourage the
owners to
to highlight prostart
kids to really look
for this
kind of
training but
again we are
and credibly small
staff
we have one person
that does all of
the education and
training
that is we need funding
to really
have a dedicated
person
dedicated to building that
pipeline
from finding the students
to working to get them
employed in a lot of states
have that
and it is just
you know
time.
But.
Here it with
our staff and so that's
we do need help and in
developing
that.
Thank you I
have to have a follow up question
quickly madam chair
when
these
when there is success
in finding
have restaurant owners for example
to be to take
some of the students are
there opportunities for wages to
be paid to the students as
well how how does
that work with the
school.
Yes they do have an of
an impact opportunity to make
money a lot
of them are already on their
staffs most most
of the kids are already in a town like
demi if you have a kid that
wants to work of
the family so
it's a lot of them do
make a considerable
amount of money and some of those kids even
go off and if with
those same owners they'll
go off and be part of their catering
team more or whatever
because they already know how to do all those
things and so
I think that's probably one of the best
things about pirtle is
the this guy had a more
early quick
I think you're gonna run like
this year they're gonna have opportunities
to run a teacher fridge that they're going
to keep stock little teams
your week it's your week for the
teachers they do all the costing the
do everything so these kids
are are leaving us
knowing how to do all these
things which is is
great for an employer because you don't have
to train them they're ready
their restaurant ready when they walk
out and that's the cool
that's kind of a cool thing I Tom you're
going to work your way through college
in a restaurant most of
you so make sure
that you you know do you
put your best foot forward and you
can that really help somebody
out because that's you
know restaurants are heard and I don't
care what anybody says there
Hurden and it's it's
been tough when you have
to close like some of our
little.
Dining rooms have to close down and
they just run drive through
because they can't find enough people to
work and those kids
can be alone
with the date with the dining room open
so they shut the dining rooms down and
they just run the drive
throughs. So they're
learning how to do all those things and make
those those balances
because they're having to make
decisions that are you know
not really ready for but they're having to
make them
so.
Thank you thank you thank you
I appreciate the information thank you
madam chair thank you Representative
Senator Diamond Brantley and then
Representative Lujan
thank you madam chair were over in our
times I want to be quick and concise
and and both my my questions and
your answers I want to quickly
follow up on representative Armstrong
is question because it wasn't
exactly answered where
exactly does prostart
funding come from
is PED
of managing any of those
funds.
It's a it's a mix the answer
is no PED is
not
managing those funds
there it well it there
is no state
funding
there is no I think yes
there is no state funding
there is no
federal
funding because it goes
to workforce development
and they have not.
Looked at that
they do not consider this ended well
until we force our way
in and one of their
statewide listening to
hers
but but
no I mean there
there is no state there
is no federal there
is a grant
that goes to CTE
and the school has to make the
decision where that is being
spent.
So there is no state funding that
that clarifies that you think thank
you madam chair presenters and
Carol I like the point you
you mentioned about a broken pipeline
because the state well and and
the nation wide we're investing
in infrastructure right
but a lot of the broken pipelines
isn't just with caring caring
water and roads it's
communication here in
information in New
Mexico and so you're
saying we're kind of working in a silo
here where we need
to get we need to connect these
kids are in this programs at
this store into
career opportunities and
I couldn't agree more I'll tell
you a $300000
asked seems very small
to do that and I appreciate you
guys taking on really
the work to fill the
state's workforce
void in this
industry
it's it's in part of the wise
what we're doing is we're graduating
students with the certificate in
culinary arts is still end up
working at Walmart
or the local convenience store
whatever because they weren't connected
to the actual work for so
it's a really important piece
of the puzzle that you're coming to an
asking for
support I absolutely
we can make all the investments
we want in this program and if
we're not willing to invest
what seems like small amounts
into connecting them into the
workforce of the jobs the
vacancies that is really
all for for nothing right
so I I think
that that seems that seems
like a small ask
I do want to ask Miss
$300000
is just use to
fill that gap correct
is to recruit
prostart students and put
them directly into New Mexico workforce
is that
correct.
Madam chair Senator
Diamond it
is really to
to grow the program
okay
to help
develop more
teachers
to help get
the you know it
even out
funding
so that choices are having
to be made
as well
as helping
fund a person
within the foundation
that is dedicated
specifically to
the.
Building that
pipeline all the
way through to supporting
the teachers
to.
Recruiting kids although
it there really.
People want to know the
students want to
and then to see working
with
restaurant owners and
managers to
hire these kids
and to make sure their support
it okay thank you madam chair
on a very similar note
and maybe perhaps care this is a question
for you New Mexico state
university's made considerable
investments into H.
RTM post hotel
restaurant tourism management
industry do they communicate
with your association regularly
and are they recruiting pro
students prostart students
who may want to go directly into a 4
year degree what
with this.
It also if I can add community
20 to community college has a
great
program.
what kind of what you're saying we are
building and the next
generation to take over the the business
thank you Mr madam chair appreciate the
time thank you representative
Representative all come.
Thank you madam chair
I am looking at 2
numbers.
For the 2 sets right now if you
get $300000 you're
looking at $7500
per school
looking at $166
for students.
What I see now and then we will
see if this is correct
you are asking for this
$300000
and PED will be a
funding
agency.
Representative thank
you for the question
we have actually
this really is about
workforce
development.
Yes it is with
in our learning
institutions are
public
schools.
But workforce
development economic
development.
Lots of different places
actually in many many states
this is funded through
workforce
development
we need
the assistance of of the
experts in this room
to determine
the right
place.
Probably that with the
least amount
of of
red tape
and turnover and
change somewhere where
there is a dedication
to making sure
that the
industry and the
program and the students are
supported and it's a
mix.
So you think that didn't
answer her question number
Representative Armstrong
question about who's
going to do the
work it
was going to work on the state side
doesn't use any idea
where the money is going to get
go to get
that you can go to LFC
and they can sit there and say we got
$300000
but.
Okay what's going to happen who's
going to handle it who's going to
but we do that right out the
texture to pay these
bills. We
have to know that to begin
with okay no that's not a
question just a comment okay
I don't want to go into another half an
hour
the other thing that I have is
I know that
once you start getting
the state money
this program is going to
expand.
They're going to ask for
more expansion
of this.
So $300000
not gonna get to anywhere.
Thanks I think we need to go for like
a minute point 5
that's my suggestion
I want the people that are out now
low C. to listen to
that the other
thing that I want people to know
see listen to is
what you're saying that you only have
1 inspector hearing
Silvercity that handles the
building in Silver City
I want to look at the
state of
employment guide
and see how many vacancies
there are for these
positions in rural
New Mexico and why
they're not field
because we do not
pay these people enough money
for them to
go into public service
rather than private business
why would somebody want to work
for 15 Bucks
an hour working for
the state of New Mexico over making
be in private business making
28 and $30
that work so that's
where LESC comes in
and say this
field is vacancies to put the
money into we can recruit
good people so
we have people that
can work in rural New
Mexico and that are
willing to work in rural
New Mexico and not
sit here and say we
don't do nothing in rural
New Mexico
because we can't
do nothing because we get recruit
people that's all
that's still to come in to have madam chair
thank you.
Thank you so much and I could I think
it's very evident that this
committee is supportive and
seen and by the way that banana nut
muffin was
amazing.
Thank you very much I'd strongly
recommend you snag those before
they they get out I think
it's very evident that this committee
is really supportive of of
what our young people are doing
of recognizing that there are
challenges and
you know I think we we all kind of are
on the same page is that we look I
look at this is like a board of directors
and that we need to be
able to provide the resources
for you to do the good work that you're
doing in the community and we see
that and I think also
there are suggestions here to keep
that conversation going
so that that can
happen
because there are opportunities
for expansion there are
opportunities to remove some
of the challenges or obstacles
the bureaucracy in government
have a tendency of putting in
place and
so I think this
is the incredible
conversation
and very evident that
we have folks that want to help you
continue moving forward
instead of walking through mud
and so really
grateful for the comments that
came from the committee today the
questions and if there
are any bits of follow up
that you want to find send those to
Erin and she will share with the entire
committee and so thank you
thank you to your students thank
you all that was
fabulous this morning as a nice
treat and so I would recommend
snagging those muffins before they
have to take them because of
those are really good
so thank you all for being here today we're
very very
grateful.

then I can go and
then the other Chris if that's
okay.
Madam chair and members of the committee
I just want to start out by saying
thank you for taking time out of your
schedule to me with members of
our our industry
and has
Senator Hamblen
mention hi
my name is Kris Schaffer
owner and operator of dry point
distillers in Los
crucis
I employ a
one full time employee
and 7 part time employees
we produce around
between 2 and 3000 cases
of of New Mexico
produce craft spirits
on an annual
basis.
Your whiskey is up frequently
used by my
group of
friends.
You know they are
yeah thank you again
madam chair members of the committee
I am Skye devore I
am the owner of tractor brewing
in troubled minds distilling
I'm a past president of the New
Mexico brewers guild in the New
Mexico distillers guild
and I'm a member of the faculty at
C. N. M. in the brewing and beverage
program so lots
of different hats running around
here today I
wanted to present some data
for you guys about
craft distilling and I'm
sorry that more barbers couldn't
be here today it's great American beer
festival and there are
winning awards so
you get me instead but
I wanted to talk about
craft spirits and
craft beer from a
what the industry is doing and how
we can grow it in our state
outside of our state perspective
so we're gonna talk about really applies
to both industry you
should all have this amazing
giant packet that I am
not going to go over every page
of our in front
of you so
at the bottom
right corner of each
page there's a little numbers
so I'll direct you guys those pages
then you guys can keep all of this
info in case you have
follow up questions
I'm so if you go to page
8
first.
You'll see a map
of distilleries
around the US
and you'll see that New Mexico is sitting
there with a 26
which is a really awesome
number but I think
that the important thing to know
is that most of us if
not all of those distilleries are
very small craft
distilleries a lot
like Chris's business or
or money or somewhere in the
middle between those
and so that is definitely
something that we we need to talk
about you know our our industry
is doing well more of us are
opening up but
none of us have yet at the
level of being consider
large or even medium
sized by national
standards.
And so then if you would like to go to
page
13.
What you're going to see is
where do a craft
distillery sales
happen and
so what you're what
you're going to see is that
24.6
percent of overall
craft distilling sales happened
at my location
so in my own tasting
rooms and then
you're gonna see that 22
percent happen inside
my home state but not
on my promise and
then 53 percent
ideally what happened outside
of your state so most distilleries
export out of state
but in New Mexico only
one of us dies.
So I think that
what what you're gonna start noticing
is that what we do have a lot
of distilleries
we're very small and
we're not hitting that
export market
right now at this point in
our and our growth trajectory
so working on figuring out
ways to export
it's something that a lot of us to really
focus on
and so that would would be something
we would want to talk to you all
about and then if
you go to page 15
just flip on
over.
Keeping in mind that
New Mexico producers
are all small if you look at the
graft on the left
you'll see that small producers
make up 10.9 percent
of all craft
producers.
And we sell
1.7
percent of the volume
nationwide so
figuring out how to get
more of our
small craft producers
into the large craft
producers column
is something that would really
benefit New Mexico
because
that's why and when we're
not seeing everything
going out of our own tasting
rooms.
If you look at
23.
So this is
looking at small
craft producers so this is all
of us in the state of New
Mexico
47.3
percent of our sales are happening in
our own distillery so this is what
you're probably used to seeing
Christmas sales happened at his
location people come and they buy
a drink they buy a bottle and they go
home.
And then you'll see 45 percent
is home state but off
premise so that would be like
a hollow spirits or
us safe house or
any of those guys were you
can see us in a total minor
grocery store so you
can buy just other places
and then only a
7.7 percent go
to other states so that's where
people are actually ending up
exported
and so whenever we ask
the question of how do we grow this
industry in New Mexico
I think that the very obvious answer
is that we need to start exporting
our spirits and beer more
out of state and relying
less on the home
state sales
and part of the way that we do that
is whenever you have an out of
state distributor what
they're looking for and
recruiting someone
to come into their portfolio
and be sold out of state
as what percentage
of your in
state sales
like where do you rank
so F. I mean
who here has heard of teller
vodka. Like
everyone probably has seen
it on a shelf
it is being sold to grocery
stores distributors from out
of state look at how many bottles
are being scanned and
they take note that like
sometimes we sell more
taller than she does
we need to go and recruit them
to be an out of state distillery
that we carry in Texas
and that's how you start getting your
growth so having that
home field advantage is
very important to being
noticed and
and being able to grow your business
outside of the state
and so that's really really
important and thing to
do another way
that we do grow
out of state is obviously leader
funding tomorrow later
going on a tour of little toad creek
who started and
Silvercity as a very
tiny taproom is now building
a facility here in Deming
and because of the
business environment that we've created
for local breweries and
distilleries they
are now looking at
exporting out of state
and are working with
trader Joe's and
sprouts to be able to put
their products out outside
of the state which is really
exciting so building
those manufacturing
facility is is
good and then also
having you know equipment readiness
you sometimes the filling
equipment takes a really long time
to be built so you want to make
sure that you've got the right equipment
at the right time
and something that I
would just like for this group
to consider is the fact
that with
the legalization of cannabis
there are a lot of cannabis
companies who would really
like to make beverages
however the law right now
prohibits New
Mexico
brewers wine growers and
distillers from alternating our
promise with those
companies because you're
not allowed to have a cannabis
establishments and alcohol
establishment on the same
premise so we could
alternate are excess
capacity with
cannabis companies so
that they could when we're not
using our equipment use
it and share some
of that equipment cost
but it's currently not allowed
under state law so.
Just like a little bug about that
that that might be something to be
considered as both industry
grow we'll start with
that also
just looking at the opportunity of
keeping money in our community
well our businesses
and dispensaries
benefit is that those
dispensaries could then rent the
space from you write the rent the time
in the space to use
that and so that would be like money
increases pocket madam chair
members of the committee that's correct
so if Chris is going
and making provide
and putting it into barrels and then
not using has put in all the
time he
could then use that surplus
and rented out share
labor force all kinds
of stuff with cannabis companies but
we're not allowed to do that right
now. Thank
you you're welcome
and so that that is 1
and then another thing
that I wanted to head on and this is going
to be my last slides so we're going
quick if you
look at number 26
that shows the employment
of craft beverage
distillers
and so what it's showing is
that we had a huge dip in
2020 and we're
coming back in 21 but we're
not back to pre
COVID levels and
I think all of you are well
aware that alcohol consumption
did not go downturn
COVID.
So I think that what you're seeing
is that it's not that
we don't winds
of more people working for us or
have that need I
think that something that's really
unique in New Mexico is
that we play
this 0 sum game with our
population
it's great that we're bringing in
Amazon and Facebook
and all of these companies but every
time we do that
I lose employees who go
to work there and because
we're actively recruiting
population for the state of New
Mexico and trying
to grow that pie.
There's really not a very
good way for me to
get those workers
backed unless I can
convince people who are not
participating in the work force at
all
to bridge
bridge that gap income and I
can't go to high schools were a
21 and over industry
and so we don't get
to I
create the same culture that the
restaurants do I
don't want to recruit 17 year
olds coming Fuhrman just
about look I'm
so really it kind of trying
to figure out if
we want to bring in
you know Amazon
Facebook I want those people
drinking my products I want
to grow in that way but
I also need more
people moving to the state
because otherwise every
time a distillery
opens for selling
most of our stuff in state
currently that
instead of buying my
stuff they're buying persist
off and then they trade off
we're not actually growing that
pie so I would
ask that you guys just
in general because we don't have a very
specific financial
legislative asked of
everyone here just
when you're looking at your policy
and economic growth
think about where the people going to
come from to do that
and looking at states that have
offered incentives to move
to their state
and take jobs so that we
do have a growing
population and there are
more consumers and
our state.
Thank
you.
Madam chair members the committee my name is
Christopher Goebel and the executive
director for the New Mexico wine and
grape growers association
thanks for your attention and your time here
in Deming today and
for visiting les Combes winery
looking for to the 2 or
later.
Very quickly The New
Mexico wine growers is a 501
C. 6 nonprofit founded
in 1991
we are the trade
association for
the winegrowers.
I personally have been
in New Mexico since
2019 makes
me someone from a millennial
person who moved
here.
And at the
time that I've spent here is been working
in nonprofit development I
was a main street manager and
Albuquerque I was the
brewers guild director from
2012 to 2016
and since 2016 I've
been here with the New Mexico
winegrowers.
There's a lot of photos in your packet
I'm very visually driven
but to.
Beautiful industry what a beautiful time
in the cycle for
New Mexico 1 or in a
crash in the harvest you'll see
active
manufacturing going on today in
your to our
but I want to quickly just walk
through a couple of the key take
aways from today's
presentation and
what's been happening in 2023
in the wine industry
sent statistics on our
festivals and events
some economic impact numbers
which is a separate document that
you have in front of you
1 of the most important things I'd
like to thank the legislature
our cabinet secretaries act
agriculture Jeff
Whitty Senator
Diamond and Representative Jones
for their work in the provide
funding creating was
probably 1 of most
transformational
investments and stimulus
projects for the
wine industry in New Mexico and
most recent memory.
We have a great project we're working
on right now for opening up a
tasting room in Albuquerque
share a bit about that
project
yesterday I was over at
NMSU we
were demonstrating a new piece of
lab equipment in their new food
science lab and I'll tell
you some of the takeaways
from that experience and then we'll and
with R. 400 your planned
strategy.
The festival
right recap I think is
1 of things that we we
have the the joy and the benefit of
here in New Mexico is these
amazing wine festivals and happen
every memorial and Labor Day
weekend 30 5000
people passed through our doors this
year this is really the
true purpose my we've
created the winegrowers association
of 91
Skive mentioned
talking about retail opportunities
and and 1991
he didn't find a lot of opportunities for
getting New Mexico product into the hands
consumers so we created our
own mechanism on
throughput which was the wine
festivals.
These are stimulus
driven
activations for these winegrowers
it it basically gives them
the opportunity to sell the current vintage
and bring money in to purchase
labels bottles
corks.
And the grapes that they need for the next
vintage so twice
a year we get to come
together in Los crucis and in
Albuquerque
it's a great event for
consumers and it really
feeds the the
engine that drives the wind
industry
28 participating Winant
wineries plus 135
non winery vendors to
generate over $5000000
and economic impact
so pretty
significant festivals I think they are
the largest in the
southwest.
With the exception of a a pretty
sick substantial festival in
grapevine Texas I think
it's certainly the
largest and this
part of the
country.
The 1 thing
I'll point out as we did receive a grant
from the tourism department
of $20000
to drive out of state
tourism in 2024
so we would just be drawing down
those funds and working on
increasing that number from 10
percent to slightly larger
down in the southern part of state you all
must know that a large portion
comes from el Paso
so that's not what we're counting in terms
of out of state we're looking for
out of state outside
of 60 miles
so.
The harvest report this was
a this was a tough year for
growers I think in in many
different
agricultural industry.
1 thing that happened here in Deming
at a winery just down the
street and vineyard at Luna
rose says that a lot of the
Chardonnay that we grew
had a free a frost event
and so we lost the Chardonnay
for 2023
so that
affects certainly folks like
grew a who have sparkling wine
and and use a lot of
that
and so yeah we will we
will not see very much 2023
Chardonnay on the
upside all the rest of the
grapes outside of
Sangiovese seem to have
escaped that freeze frost
events so
that's a that's a
plus it
was not cold enough to kill any divine
so wasn't a terminal events but
it certainly did affect
this year's harvest
we had great rainfall and and
June 10 lead
into the
the drought in the heat of the
summer at some points
it look like no matter how
much drip irrigation we were using
by noon it was evaporated
away and but
thankfully vines enjoy the struggle
and the fight and
they survive through the heats
into the August
temperatures
that turn into rain
right at the exact time we were
starting to harvest and
I just a little quick story
about raining grapes
when the rain comes down to get sucked
into the grapes and they become
diluted and so the
sugars are no longer is
concentrated in so we can't
pick those grapes and so
that that water evaporates
back out of the berries
so it's delayed the harvest
into September and we will
be likely harvesting until
the end of October this
year. And
as you can see the quality the
vintage it's a wait and see
scenario
you never know what's going to happen until it's
in the bottle and it's all done
but from what I
hear from our wine growers are optimistic
that we're going to have a
very good year.
I'm not gonna spend a ton of time on the
economic impact is a lot of
numbers in front of you
on that separate sheet of paper
you'll see white
America as a trade association
we belong to that's national
group of wineries
and wine Association
boards they put
together the economic impact
study on our behalf
so John Dunham and associates
of New York produced
this document that's
in front of you what I will say
about economic impact studies
is that they are
typically.
Large in their statements
of what is being done so I
take with a grain of salt an
outside entity who is looking
at our state and
the particularly the
implied in the induced
impacts I think those
can sometimes
draw in out of
state wine sales
and and attribute them to the in
the state so I really like to just
look at the jobs
created by
winery vineyard in
association
so the numbers around 680
jobs there
and still
while
I do.
Think that these numbers are probably
inflated it certainly
does pandemic a pretty
positive picture for the impact
that the wine industry does have
when you look at the generation of
federal and state local
taxes
the impact this is particularly
large facilities
like grew a LESC
homes and noisy water
are probably the largest
3 wonders in the state making a lot
of that impact with
exporting product out of the
state.
Moving on to the vine fun this is
really the meat potatoes my
presentation here and I think
what is made us most
excited in the
industry
we have seen here in New
Mexico.
A really strong
increase in the interest in planting
vines initially in
2022 when you prove
the funds we were able to use
those funds retroactively to
support the grapes that were planted
in 2022
about 1
quarter of the funds were used
in 2020 to 50 5000
vines were planted at that
time
and
it was a great opportunity
to then
inspire additional
plantings in 2023
we're still calculating the
total number of vines I have
a you may have heard of
Dino serve on taste down here he
is a new grape grower
in these chili grower
who's now moved into the grape
universe and he's planted at
least. 40
acres I believe if not
more and so that's
really exciting project those
grapes are all contracted out
in advance so
another little story here about grapes
they take about 3 years to
4 years to make full
maturity so the drugs
that we planted in
202223252020252026
you'll see those in full
production.
In 2023 we had
14 applicants we've
started to see some new growers that
are coming into the industry like
Dino there's a
new grower in Cuba
we have folks outside of
Albuquerque so
they range in size from as
I said Mr serve on
cases working on about 40 acres
to
3 acre plots that are
smaller producers that are putting
they're dipping their toe in the
water.
The total investment so far
in 2020 to
2023 is about 530
5000 leaves us with
390 4000
remaining for the 24
season we've already started to
ramp up I've
met cabinet secretary
witty and myself met
with just let a
pueblo is that a
problem has been growing grapes
since at least 1846
as far as the documentation we
can see they currently
are not growing but
they have agricultural
products in their new strategic
plan and so we
are very hopeful that they'll
bring back grape growing to
their community.
Santa Ana pueblo has 30
acres they're currently growing for
grew way they did
not plant this year because
unfortunately there the
culture is passed away
and they are going to hopefully
be adding another 20
acres and
2024
Nambi Pueblo left their
grapes during the Pueblo
during the pandemic to
go fallow and they really
didn't have the right varieties
growing in bay they have
about 8 acres available and
so we're in conversations with them
about replanting as
well what we
would be 1 of 2 states in
America that is working with
tribal entities to grow grapes
I think it's a really interesting
time from up
from a publicity and and from
a marketing standpoint.
The wine industry looking for stories
of diversity and I think we can
tell a very strong story here in New
Mexico so I'm
encouraged
however the time when a short
just let Pueblo needs to drill a new
well they need to get the
infrastructure other funding
in place so
if they missed the window for
2025 I'm hopeful
that we can talk here today
about the potential
for renewing the great
and the vine fund for
another 2 years and trying to
really push
this impact
forward.
There's a number of photographs that you
have here that I took
during my vineyard inspections
we want to make sure that those people who are
getting funding actually put the
grapes in the ground
in Deming just down the the
road on the opposite side
of town
gonna roast of endurance
is a company that also
manages and owns now The
New Mexico vineyards and nurseries
they purchased this
from a group of Swiss
investors
it is 75 acres of
grapes they have
added an additional
20 acres of grapes
here and the Deming area and
I believe will be
adding another 20
acres in
2024.
I was up in viva rock a small
winery called
and Dixon they've
added 45 acres of
new grapes.
In noisy water
winery out
of.
Read also New Mexico
has purchased a piece of
property in
Rincon just south of how
much they have been planted
50 acres of of new
grapes in the last 2
years.
And they are speaking with
a number of their neighbors who are
chilly and con farmers who
are interested and also
potentially switching over
to 2 grapes
one of the great things about this product
is it's a drip
irrigation
system and so it uses
the smallest amount of water
that you can possibly use for
agricultural crop
because again the point is to
to make the money struggle
and work hard.
In order to create
a quality product and
then less comes family winery
where we are today has vineyards
in
Lordsburg and they
have.
They've committed to
me.
Other not here all right may have
committed to plant 20
acres
a year for the next 5
years that was the plan that I
heard recently so 100
new vineyard acres and
Lordsburg to expand
their production here and
we certainly hope that that
comes to fruition.
Here's the big the big
aha moment the R. O.
Y. on the
find fund so one acre
of fines is
1000 vines is
$5000 a cost
about $20000 to
put in a new acre
so we are only subsidizing a
quarter of the amount
of the in total
investment so its still requiring
these these wineries and growers to
come up with the other
funds.
That being said these
people are not just growing
what we are paying
for
so dina Servan tastes
less combs noisy
water winery they're planting
more than their
total allowed amounts
we will only pay
back $50000
per grower per year
so we again
stimulating further growth
within the
industry.
Just a very quick numbers 25000
cases per.
Per 0 acres means
$23000
worth of excise tax annually
reoccurring for the life of these
lines.
That 0 acres equates
to 300000 models
are $440000
a G. R. T. so
very quickly the
state of New Mexico is reaping the
benefits of recouping its
investment and
within 5 to 75 to
6 years once these lines are
all mature you're
definitely going to get your money back on
this investment in the in the
industry.
The hope is to plant 250 to
280 acres
by the end of the 2024
growing season.
So again I.
I can't tell you how
important this is to the industry
having grapes is the key
first input that we have
to have in order to make more wine
if we don't plant more
grapes are wine
makers will have to source from out
of state that we trucking grapes
and from
California Washington and
and and and
or again and I think
what we want to see here is a value
added product that is grown here
produced here
and sold out of New
Mexico.
One of the exciting projects I get to work
on this year is opening up a tasting
room in Albuquerque so
once we've planted all these greats we've
made all this money we need to sell it to
the people and so our
tasting room will aggregate from all the
wineries around the states
in a as fair a
way as we can possibly do it
we will probably source from
about 5
to 7 wineries every
2 months and then we will
change that inventory to
keep it fresh for the consumer and
also give everyone a chance
to use our tasting
room
we will also be using
as a welcome senator Azam
activation space so we
we really want to be able to take advantage
of the tourism departments
coop funds to put
advertising The Dallas
airport in
Colorado airport
and and
whatever the other target cities might be
Chicago and say come to New
Mexico come to our
the living a tasting room and plan
your New Mexico 1 to
our use this as a
gateway for folks to find
where they want to go travel
and take their trips across
New Mexico
simultaneously we have a
$80000 grant to redo
our website to add it
e-commerce functions that
allow us to sell 1 online
and distribute the wine
virtually through the internet
and that website will kind
of near our tourism
center giving people
opportunities for traveling
in 2:00 hours tour
operators are contacting us
now to try to be on the
website so we can send customers
their way so they can book their
the C. a valley 1 to our or
their northern New Mexico 12
or. And
we just received $40000
from the visit Albuquerque
xcelerated grant will be working
with IDM which is a
company out of Kerala's they
make these table top
displays where you
can put down your wine glass and it
will pull up a
story about that wind it
will show you photographs it'll tell you
where the grapes were grown
so it's very interactive high
touch experience
some of you might have seen that these
at these Albuquerque
Sunport there's a video
display of all the films that are
being shot in New Mexico
that is an IDM
interactive display they
also did the penguin display at
the bio park
so these are table top displays they're
installing internationally in
cruise ships and out of
state we will have the first beverage
station in New
Mexico so people can
literally come up to the table put their
4 glasses of wine down
and have a guided tasting to
or without any
human interaction
and so they can book an reserve
that space it'll
be 8 a definite
I opening experience for
journalists travelers
and folks coming through the space
and hopefully will
inspire some
tourism officials.
I promise to make this quick
our higher ed partners we
just yesterday were an issue
launching a new piece of equipment called
a speaker it is a juice
analyzer that allows
winegrowers throughout the
life of the Jews to
know what's happening with their products
so they can take
it in from the vineyard and they can
find out how much sugar is in
there is in the
wine and the grapes
after crush they can test
for there
your hand which is
there the nitrogen that
the that the east used
to create the wine
very technical stuff I did not
understand the first of it
which is okay because I don't make
one but I definitely saw
winemakers in the room nodding their
had this piece of
equipment is available for anyone
in the state to use they can
instead of shipping their samples out to
California to Texas they
can now come down to and I miss
you walk on campus
get that analysis done in 25
minutes.
So this is the first
piece of equipment that we really would
like to see at the new food
sciences lab which is going to
be dedicated on November
3
and it's a great opportunity
for us any state that
has a legitimate one industry
California has UC Davis
Washington as Washington State
University Oregon
as Oregon State University New York
has Cornell
all the states that are recognized for
having a legitimate wine
industry have a relationship
with a strong university land
grant university backing
them up and I think that's what
we need to continue to invest in
here in New Mexico to
see our wine industry really take
quality and
and and
quantity to the next
level.
We also dedicated $1 from
every ticket sold from our Labor Day festival
to scholarship $6000
went to see NM for
their beverage management program
which guys one of the educators
and another $6000
came out of Los crucis festival
to support the H. R. team
program we
believe heavily in the
work that Dr Jean hurts men in the
H. R. team folks are making
in their the future servers of
our products and we want to
support them as best we
can.
I think those of you in the
industry on the
economic development for
minded folks here know about the
leader programme and noisy
water winery just received
2050 $0 to do
expansions to the
program.
They're going to triple their
output they're gonna create
25 new jobs
I have some employee
housing
Jasper riddle was the
small business of the year
2019 runner up
nationally and is
really done an amazing job and
and Rideau 7
alto with
his
with his family's business that started
with 2 employees and
800 cases a year about
10 years ago so
really proud of of what
Jaspers doing and I think this
is another sign of the
investment that the state is made and
it's 1 industry
to wrap up we have
the 4 hundredth anniversary I keep
reminding people 2029
is just around the corner
our state 5 year strategic
plan for the quad wrist and
Tennille is
under way and I think
step number 1 of that was the provide
fund program that you all created
for us
we would love to talk today
and further about the
renewal of the vine
Fund. I I
mentioned the.
MSU lab I think there's
some pieces of equipment that we could
talk about and
potentially the
idea of right reoccurring
funds for a laboratory
staff in the food sciences
lab they're
gonna need someone to continuously
operate these machines
it can be used by the brewing industry
by the distilling industry
anyone who's making cereal
any other food products can
use this piece of equipment is
not just isolated
for the winegrowers
and alkalis
how. There's some
machine that.
That will tell you the exact amount of alcohol
and beverage it's about
$25000
it gives us what we could put
on our labels the
exact amount of alcohol
instead of doing calculations
and getting close we would know
specifically again it's
piece of equipment could be used
across all the craft
beverage sectors so I think
there's some opportunities for discussion
there we
were participants in the state
fair this year and have been for the
last 8 years in the agriculture
building we do wind
happy hours
we are in conversations with the
state fair and the cabinet
secretary of agricultural
bout a renovation
to the Act building which is called the
block building
we would like to put a
permanent tasting room
inside of this building so
that for the 11 days of fair
we can be reaching those 5000
people who are walking through the
doors and
so I think you'll be seeing
some I see P.
I think they call it.
I see I. P. requests coming
through important Dan morning
that is focused on the
potentially some renovations to
that building at the state
fair we have
a state viticulturist the guy
who's the vine consultants we would
like to add a state and knowledge
just this is the wine
a consultant that comes in and
helps work on quality.
And and we are avid
fans of the tourism
department cooperative marketing
and the value added producer
and that specially crop block
grants so we thank you
for your continued support
of tourism those
dollars funneled down to
us and we get
to the opportunity to take our
marketing message
nationally.
One big request from
this group we haven't been able to figure
out road signage for
hot for for
wineries.
30 states across
the country have road signage
for whiners Alabama has
road signs for wineries and
they they're not known for
their wine I think this is
something that would be amazing
it's a it's a project we have
to work with TOT
on and we have to figure
out how to do it
in a responsible way
I don't think I'm talking about
giant signs on I.
25910 I'm talking
about turning points
when you get off the road that says
winery 5.2 miles
this way 2.2
miles that way
it would be ideal if we had a pilot
project perhaps
we could do it in the corral just
area we could do
it down along not 1
highway on highway 28
but highway road signage for
the fourteenth anniversary would be
a game changer
and I I would I would love to figure
out how we do that I think it's a
multi department
program but I think
pilot project would be a great place
to start and thank you
for your time and your consideration
I
appreciate.
So thank you I think we
have a lot of questions
you know it's it I
I look at it from a marketing perspective
and and look at
the ways that we can
celebrate all
the different things that make you New Mexico
unique and also just recognizing
the economic opportunities when we talk
about diversifying our revenue stream
we've got this I've got you
senator Tom anyone ask a question
okay that
we really want to look
at these different opportunities that
can not only bring people
to our state but also
provide
economic support in
different region especially when we're
looking at rural communities like here in
Deming just the
opportunities
I'm I'm I
I'm thinking and I'm gonna
start turning on like the
ideas of how we can help
maximize the 400 years
because correct me if I'm
wrong the wine industry
started here way before
napa we're
170 years before
California right so
we're we're doing ourselves
a disservice by ignoring that
we should be really promoting
that because I'm
tired of napa valley getting all the
credit and getting all the
money and all the visitor
ship so you know
I think that's something that we can
do I do have
representative Armstrong Representative
Hernandez Senator Diamond
Brantley Senator
toman
also wanting to ask
Representative all
COVID.
If I can the Chris I'm
thinking of of of yours in skies
above your your business
is as you know it just
really kind of the the the in the
community small
businesses and I'm
wondering what
what are the things that are keeping
you from being able to
export.
Hi Chris I think of years because I'm familiar
with your operation
and really you're still
fairly new in the in the
world of of distilling
and you've made such a big impact
on it so we what would.
In your case what would
it take in order
for you to be able to export
your
spirits.
Well madam chair thanks for the
question
so in my specific
situation I you know
like I said I I'm a small
operator I kind of you know
jokingly refer to myself as a now
additional are automatic
microdistiller really
quite small and so a lot of it
is coming
up with the funding to be able
to expand my facility I
run my
distilleries and a tasting
room all within
2400 square
feet and
so I've tried to
expand to where I'm at
but you know starting at you
as with any small business you
you struggle with
you know coming up with funds for expansion
and so the manufacturing
industry and specifically
in that you know additional
spirits manufacturing industry
we have to deal with
you know zoning just
you know that your parcels
owned for for
industrial uses
you know fire codes
that you know a
lexical
fixtures the decision
area like a distillery
are really expensive being
explosion proof so
a lot of that comes up with funding
but also like sky was
mentioning just having
to be able to fight with
you know are competing with
national
brands you
know some of the household names
that we're competing with
on the retail shelf to
to try to you
know showcase New Mexico
spirits and you know try
to convince the the consumer
that taking a risk
on a product such
as ours which is usually sold at a
premium because we're
you know we're small you know small
businesses
and be able to get that market
share to show the
distributors that were
worthwhile brand
to be able to take out of
state
and so as far as specific
goal requests that mean I I
don't know that we have any you
know as a distillers
guild any specific quest but
you know on a personal side B.
O. date get easier access
to to state funds I looked at
early on some some
funding
through I think is in New Mexico
department of agriculture but you. Had to
have a certain period of
time of you know
financial records to be able to
apply to some of these
funds
and so you
know. Just trying
to navigate some
potential avenues
for maybe
state assistance in growing growing
small businesses would be
you know if 11
aspect.
Thank you for that I'm wondering if
you know when sky when you're talking
about. Being
able to in because
of that we can't cross in
essence cross pollinate cannabis and
alcohol but
you you sparked an idea with me
that that I'm wondering and I and I'd
like to get just your honest feedback
on that if we were to have
in different regions of the state
kind of like an
incubator a multi
use where
then you wouldn't
be putting together
the full costs of of
expansion facility
but that it it can be
used by multiple
distillers
it and be able to
expand I've is that reasonable
or is that just
the. I
I'm kind of curious about
the reason why I ask is because it's
it's much less because it's much less
cost
oppressive for one
particular distiller
and then it gets it gets
expanded over multiple ones that
can be using this facility
but I don't know if that's practical for
you and that's why I'm asking right
madam chair members of the committee it's
a great question so what
you kind of run into is like
legal problems we would have to
alternate our promise at the federal
level and then also
at the at the state level
also knowing can you
know make money off of alcohol
who's not a liquor license
holder from like a
state wide
perspective and
also you know if you look at
the numbers where do small
people sell most of
their product people Chris is
size well it's not his
tasting room so if you have
one big manufacturing
facility that everyone is
alternating would
have to allow for each of those
alternating proprietors
to have a separate retail
space or tasting room that's
not connected to their
distillery which is not
currently really allowable
under the law I mean it could have
one book and then off
sites but we would have to really kind
of work with alcoholic beverage
control who you'll hear from
later about how
that that might work
out from a
from an alternating promise
perspective.
I appreciate that I'm trying to look at
what ways are cost effective but
also don't put as
much hardship on our
smaller local
businesses to
make it a little bit more accessible
for them to be able to do that
so I appreciate your ideas on
that and
and and really we want to keep
a practical but we want to keep the cost
effective but we also want to be able to
uplift you and
and be able to help you make money outside
of the state because there's only so
many people that can keep coming back to
your places you
know and and you your constant
jobs to try and recruit new
people so I
appreciate that thank you
for answering that question and and let's
keep that conversation going I'm
representative Armstrong your first and
then Representative Lujan Hernandez after
that thank you madam
chair and thank you for The presentation
it's this is an industry
that I don't know a lot about but
I I really like learning
about it so
who keeps actual track
because you're saying to be able to
distribute into other
states you need to kind of
be at the top of that list
for sales who keeps
track of those sales.
Madam chair representative
Armstrong but so there
is a company that
tracks grocery store
scans so the big
grocery stores like Smith's
Albertsons
they track every you
PC that is scanned through
their check out system
and then they compile the data
and sell it to people
so distributors from other
markets will by the data I
think it's $10000 a
year to access it
so they'll know exactly how
much the commemorate a livid
IPA versus Santa Fe
bring 7 K. IPA
went through their stores
and so the southern wine and spirits
in like another state will look at
that and actively
pursue crest if he's
above the Mendoza
line of sales
for his state
okay thank you that that was a little
confusing for me but I understand
it better now so madam chair is
that also like
it it do
you sell to total
wine industry
like that or is it just grocery
stores.
Madam chair representative Armstrong
we sell to everybody
total wine is that large
chain will look at their
local numbers
when they're considering going
to others and and then
there are such a big player
they will ask a distributor to
pick you up and
so that it's like oh you're
going into HB
total wind wherever it
is it doesn't take into
account small places like
cliffs
Connie's quarters
Kelly is those aren't those aren't
tracked.
Okay thank you so much I'll start
buying well
you know I just want to total wine I
had a big party and I bought all New
Mexico spirits
because I'm a huge New Mexico
supporter.
But I'd you know I want to make sure it's
getting tracks on a bite from
the place that I
want to get tracked
so and
and on the
other point of cannabis
and liquor are you talking
about cannabis
infused beer and
alcohol no Madam
chair representative I'm sorry no
not at all a
federally we can't we can't
do that it's a very big no no
we're talking about someone
wants to make a cannabis
beverage
and we don't
make anything on our canning
line not day out
beer wise they bring in
their cannabis beverage can
add on our canning line we
completely clean it they
leave and they're just
basically renting that piece of
equipment from us.
Okay thank you I I was just
curious so like
Canibus to defuse
soda or water
or okay
thank you thank you madam chair.
Thank you so much we have a
full gringo chili company does the same
thing where they rent
out their
their facilities for other small
smaller cells producers
Representative Hernandez and then
Senator Diamond Brantley thank
you madam chair
that statement real quick I rented
to Chris from teller yesterday so
everybody here knows from safe
house sorry who has teller
they got approved last week
to expand to 7 new
states so they will
be doing
a huge export
and they just won Beth
best craft
vodka in the
country
which is awesome he's proudly
displayed his point his
glass plate award
so.
And then I was gonna talk
about this but the THC and alcohol so
a big thing that's happening right now in the
industry just kind of
going through other states is
that like
ATC infused
seltzer
is big in breweries
now and
it's big in retail they
bring I can and like we
can't sell it in our state because
we can't produce it in our state and
everything that we sell in our state has to
be produced here
so I've started a draft of a
bill with the
governor's office because what
other states are doing is they're
using synthetic
marijuana or
THC called delta 8
that has ridiculous
health risks attached to it
as they're getting further and
further in people actually died from
it and so I
would rather have a.
You know let the brewers and
distillers
be able to produce something in the state
that we can sell in the state that's going to be
safe instead of getting
through a loophole by using as
delta 8 so
I would love both of you guys help on
that as as I get a draft
back.
So actually my I have
2 things I would love for you to talk
about the C. N. M.
distilling and brewing
program and how that's bringing students
from other states to come
here and learn and then
work in the industry
because I think that that is a
huge thing I mean as you were saying
population growth is
something that we are that
is a huge problem as we
continue to go on
so if you just like 30
second thing about with C.
N. M. as providing
but thank you madam
chair Representative Hernandez
so the C. N. and bring a beverage
program I started
several years ago
and what we have done is
we have gone and toward
schools that other at
other colleges
that specialize in bring about
fridge and with
funds from the legislature
we've built out a brewing distilling
and winemaking lab
at C. N. that it's
actually nicer than probably
any brewery distillery
or winemaker in the whole
entire state and we
are now seeing students from other states
come and so that they can get this
education
and those
jobs are
staying here and there
state and local we can't produce
enough graduates to
satisfy like the need in our
state and every single
member of my during through today
is one of my former students
so I'm proud of that
one.
Thank you so much and madam
chair and I
wanted real quick as you and I have
talked about this in the past through a
bill
brewers association I
know pieces
about direct to consumer
shipping and I know
that this is a bad
model for New Mexico can you
give like a 60 second
overview of why
that because there's a lot of
info in here and I don't know that
everybody's gonna read it can
you give me like
a 60 second overview of why this
would be bad for breweries and
distilleries in our state
please thank you
madam chair Representative
Hernandez so
direct to consumer shipping
allows people
to ship into our state
so every state is home state
rule so in New Mexico
we currently have a law where
out of state wineries kinship
in state and that's
a great law because you go to
napa
and you want to join the
wine club anyone have acacia
back to you once in awhile and that's
a really really good model
that's been proven to work
I think where you get into
trouble is when ever
I was brewing and distilling
if you are the first state or
one of the first few states to
jump into this boat
basically what would happen is out
of state breweries and distilleries
would be allowed to ship into New
Mexico but we wouldn't
necessarily be allowed to ship
out so if you're looking
at taxes and we allow
Texas distilleries to ship in
New Mexico but I can't than
ship into taxes
you're taking what people would
normally buy as craft
in New Mexico from New Mexico
breweries and distilleries
and you were giving them the option
of having something from
another state chipped
in so those
manufacturing jobs are
ending up in that other
state at the end of the
day and so it's something
that it's great to
get on the on the boat
with everyone when everyone's already
on the boat but you don't want to
be the one building about
and so that's where we're we
kind of have some some issues with
that.
me if I'm wrong grew away is not
recognizes is recognized
as either
the best if not one of the best
champagnes in the
country.
Madam chair thank you for bringing that
to the attention of this group are
creating a is one of
the top
5 producers of sparkling wine
in the nation they make all the private
label for whole foods for
total wine for trader
Joe's
they are about a 400000
case winery now
they just installed brand
new equipment that will allow them to
put.
I think it's 1000
bottles
every 5
minutes into basis
so the expansion of money that's
going into creating a is is
is phenomenal and their new
one maker from France 0
tonnes Act is doing
amazing things we should be
very proud and we should be working
hard to bring the attention
of the world to the fact that
sparkling wine is made here
we've also added vara
distilling where the wrong
grew a the founder of creating a is now
the sparkling wine maker so we have
second facility that's now in
Albuquerque
and I think's bubbles in
the desert is a great
campaign to celebrate
400 years of New Mexico
one making. So
my wife's favorite champagne
if not the the most so I
appreciate that
Representative L. con then
Representative Zamora and
then Senator Griggs with finishes
off. Thank
you madam chair I want to
just give you a short story
before I go into my
idea
it is I hope
everybody knows why we
have magistrates judges
in the state of New Mexico
rather than justice of the
peace's.
That does the system
where the judges would get
paid for every case they
heard instead of a
salary.
The judges didn't but bill
New Mexico with
legislation close to the
Reds area
and the judges in Santa
Rosa we're
making more money
than the Supreme Court
justice
because of their fees that they
collected
okay so
to get to my story
is why can't
we have a set
up we
have a
basically something
along the
interstate
on all the other states
what we sell New Mexico
products to
the people that are traveling
through New Mexico
and they can buy their beer
they're wonderful whiskey
anything made in New
Mexico other
this establishments
so thinking taken back
home I know we
have some kind of license
like that that
would allow us to do
something like this
I see those
Davies we're
making all that money
you can imagine how much
traffic travels Senator
state.
And how much
money you could bring
into the
coffers.
Of people like
you. How
would anybody ever thought of
her licensing system like
that Senator
Griggs.
100 is the I mean there's I'm
familiar with the picnic license
that a lot of but it's
got you can go and where I I
Madam chair representative
Akan
basically that kind of a license
would be a package liquor license
and it would essentially compete
with are very expensive
package liquor
licenses
and so I know that
you're not going to like that answer but
that is the answer.
In madam chair and I
understand that correctly
but the thing is that this
would be deciding to be
only New Mexico
products nothing
else I mean you could not
bring but like to the to made
somewhere else and put it
in your establishment or whatever
brand okay color at a
lot of big scores to get Regan
into this establishment
is gonna be New Mexico
well Representative I do know that like
we've got the system we've got
this in place now that like our
local wineries can also sell our
local beers and our local
spirit so
starting to get there
to where you can cross promote each
other but I
don't know if you want to expand on that
sky
Madam chair representative all
con that is like a very innovative
idea and I think that of New
Mexico only
quote liquor store would be a
really fun thing to
do and try we now have like
the restaurant be
lessons were present
a I don't remember where you
can only do New Mexico
spirits and so I
think that that's definitely something
that we could talk to
director.
I don't remember Phillips last
name Sanchez
about whenever
he gets out to
right.
Sorry
whenever whenever he gets out but I
I definitely think that's a great
idea whenever you have
when you go to Denver you can buy
Colorado beer in the airport
and take it on the plane with you
are you can buy green chili in New
Mexico I'm pretty sure you can
probably buy why now we're just a
little behind.
Madam chair if I may also
add to this
I think that the department of agriculture
doesn't amazing job of
promoting the taste the tradition
program which is products that are
made in New Mexico if
you go to the country store at the state fair
the last 11 days they've been
selling an enormous amount
of product they are
not allowed to sell your one
in spirits however
their homegrown show they do at
the farm
and livestock
museum is an example
of taking that that
show on the road so I
a collaboration with the department
of agriculture might be a really great
opportunity to find a solution
to your wonderful
idea.
Thank you Representative Representative
Zamora and then Senator
Griggs.
Thank you madam chair and
thank you presenters it's been a great
presentation I've learned a
lot. I have
a question for
anyone of you is
it not true that we
can make one out of.
Rice beans
apples all
kinds of other things.
Madam chair representative more
a it is true that you can make
wine or spirits
or beer pretty much out
of any agricultural
product we upon the
grant wine that we make in the
state apple wine
or cider are
both made with with apples or
pears
under the license chair New Mexico
I'm sure you could make sake
of rice so I
think the fermentation of
any sugar
based agricultural
product is legal in the state
okay and and why is
everybody so hooked on the
grapes.
Madam chair representative is more
the the return
on investment so that the value
added chain from taking
grapes into wine is one of the
highest in the in all
agricultural products
so the conversion in the price point
that one can get from taking
grapes from the ground and putting it into
a bottle and selling just as
wine
is is the highest
conversion rate for the value
chain.
And I think it's one that the consumers
currently are the most familiar
with I will say that the new
generation of
22 to
30 year olds are experimenting
and they're interested.
In new products that are made
with different with different
fruits vegetables
grains
and I think the industry is
definitely showing
the craft beverage injury cost
industry across the board has
been bringing in
New.
Baseline products new
agricultural products and converting
them adding them for example in New
Mexico we make blue corn
whiskey for example
right and I think that's we're probably
one of the only states that does
that
so I think
the it's a combination of
what the consumers willing to pay
for and what the industry
is prepared to to
work with okay
and and madam chair
and.
So if
if a
person has
a.
Winemaking facility like
this if
they important Jews
from Washington
state are.
Maybe the country
Mexico.
The in the import grape
juice they can turn
that into one.
Is that considered New Mexico
wind. Madam
chair representative the more that is
correct any
any. Half
beverage producer in the state can
bring in their inputs
from anywhere they source
from they
can then converted through the
fermentation process into
alcohol here and then sell
that as in New Mexico made
product in New Mexico
we do have stature statutes
in place that protect the one
industry that say a
New Mexico winery must use
51 percent
grapes from the state of New
Mexico in
order to produce
their products in order to have their
license and only in a
time of shortage or when they
cannot purchase those
products from New Mexico are they
allowed to then buy from out of
state and
madam chair.
Chris right so
so then
was that rural put into place
to protect the great growers
here in New Mexico
or or
is that like a federal rule
that that every state can
just claim if they have 51
percent Madam chair representative
Zamora
so that was written in statute
when we created the winegrowers license
in the seventies as a way
to ensure that the product
was grown here and maybe here
other states for example all
pick on Texas because we like
to
the predominant source
of Texas wine is
from great to come
from out of state and there is
not the same
protections for the growers in Texas
that we have here in New Mexico
I will say it's a very
difficult
enforcement
process for
for an entity from the government to
come in and and check
the the 51 percent
rural
however I think the intention
from writing the original
legislation was to say
that we want to have the product grown here
the product made here
from our personal
opinion is the one grows
Association
it is the highest level of
the value chain in the value added
process though I
think it's a it's essential
for the investment that we've made
with the vine Fund
to have the production of
grapes here in the state in
order to say that this product is
truly a New Mexico
product and
madam chair and and
Chris I've
farmed my whole life made a
living in in the agriculture
business and that be
great if
if we had people interested
in growing grapes here
and to improve
our farming industry
but if we don't does that
rule doesn't that rule just actually
heard 2
more.
Madam chair representative Mara
I.
At this point we have 55
wineries in the state
and there is
a a great balance
to the amount of grapes that we're
growing to the not a product that we're
producing.
There is a clause within the
statute that allows for winery
to purchase from out of state when it's
not available so it does
not inhibit growth
and I would say very
honestly to the folks in this
committee grew a winery
cannot get their hands on enough Chardonnay
grapes in New Mexico to
make a tenth
of what they need so
grew As an example of a company
who has to source
from out of state in order to meet
their production demands
and and so
the the rule in the statute
does not in it does
not prohibit the growth
of the wine industry but
I do think it creates a degree of
authenticity so that when somebody
comes here they know that the
product
at the great
the wind the wind river
statute allows for
a lot of things to happen I was for
folks to bring in.
Finished wine and
and stored in New
Mexico for a couple of months
and put a label on and call in New Mexico
product something that we
would we would like to
not see happen we would like to
maintain the integrity of the industry
and.
And so while I do believe
that the statute is written in such a
way as to create
opportunity for the wine industry
to grow
sometimes things that are written too
broadly into openly
can be detrimental if it's
taken to
the logical conclusion
thank you thank you madam chair
and thank you for your
answer. I see
we have a little more yeah I just
wanted to if you made
that Madam chair representative
somewhere if I could get back on
that and speak at to the same
issue but from
distillers and maybe even a burger
standpoint is that when
you're looking at
sourcing our raw
materials so with that
the wonders industry that be the
great but with that
distillers I'd be you know grain
so I make blue corn
Bourbon
but I also
use a ride we and
barley in that that
same Bourbon and I've had
some difficulties in the state's
sourcing these grains that
are grown in New
Mexico but most of those are being
used for silage and so
you know I requirements as a
distillery's to to
start with that food
grade you know refined
grain there's no
you know stands are chapter
rocks or anything else that
you know I I I County
be okay using and
so for instance.
I purchased my blue corn
and yellow corn for
my Bourbon from
local greenery up in
Albuquerque southwest heritage
mills which is a all native
American owned and
operated and sourced
granary but he's prices
since you know to the
pandemic of race 300
percent in so just trying
to find affordable sources so
this may be more of an appeal for New Mexico
department of agriculture to
develop these programs
to encourage farmers
to potentially produce more
corn right
we are the things that
that distillers and
and brewers would be
using their products
may to create
a you know ripple effect
of these
industry using
you know these trains that are actually
produce inside the
state.
Thank you thank you
thank you madam chair.
Thanks guy you want to add to it
madam chair and Representative
Zamora additionally bers
require extra processing of
malting and so what
traditionally happens if people
decide to programs in New Mexico
we have to ship it out of state to be
malted for
State malting facility
just opened out as far back
farms and so we're hoping
to bring some of that back in state
but we're really missing a whole bunch of
infrastructure and processing
to take these agricultural
products and turn them into
usable inputs for
for beer.
Thank you so much for that I keep thinking
is is we as we continue
to have discussions in this committee
and senator grateful to justice
sack is like having each
industry like have like a
wishlist because the thing that drives
me nuts is when we have
to go out of state to get these
things when we
you know in some cases don't know
that we need to start trying
to nurture these industries
within our state so
that we can keep the products
here and then make the money
here and support jobs here
instead of supporting jobs from
elsewhere and so
I I don't know where we can begin
but I kind of think of it as like a wish
list so that then we can
start working with other industries
and other areas of
production and trying
to find the sort resources
for you so that
it's all creating the
sustainable
community that
we really would benefit from the
state so my
I just want to kind of marinade on
that Senator going to we're
gonna finish this
up.
Thank you madam chair and and you
all to.
To say the kind
of that that liquor laws
nationally and in New
Mexico
our our convoluted
is probably an
understatement.
Every every year
we come up and we talk
about different
things and
we we
try I think and
we've tried for years to
put together staff
in place to make
things easier better
more accessible
to to industries
across across the
way
and then you run into staff
we're.
Guys who
have.
Licensure is to
produce licenses to
shale but they
can't shale
outside of New
Mexico
Representative alcune
probably has a
idea that is is
workable
in that you allow
the shale of New
Mexico
whiskeys outside
of the of the Mexico
we're not talking about you
know others come
in different things like
that we're talking about
allowing the small producers
to to
sell outside now I don't
know I don't know
when when I say that.
Wholesalers fate in this
mix
somewhere
and where
is that I
don't know when I think that would
be
a deal which would be good
to
discuss
with the with the wholesalers
and she have that might
might work and how they might could
benefit all of
the but I
think it could be at a
chance.
One of the things I want to bring
up to the committee and
and we're gonna talk
about
we should be here for
second
wish he has a a
certain
definition.
In which people primarily
is tied to
Kentucky.
And then there's this other
Wyszki
which made in
Tennessee.
H. called Tennessee
whiskey because it's
actually.
A Bourbon.
Which is different.
It's different
whether to barley or
what it corn
whatever it has in it that's
that said makes it different
than traditional
whiskey.
My thought is that
you know you you guys
in New Mexico are
making.
A product.
And if you wish he
or to Bourbon.
Is there something that the
associations are the
trade group
could start thinking about
and say that we're going to
make a New
Mexico
Wyszki. And
that New Mexico which queue
will be made with a
certain percentage
of their sure
that and so
then you have a
distinct
marketing
tool to
go outside of New
Mexico and and
makes it different maybe
it it makes each
mood or maybe to any a
number of things but
something to to think
about if that
you in a
reasonable
thought.
Your last year madam chair we
had a we had a building
that came through that that
wound up being in the in the
tax package that would
each we're.
Or something that
in the the
Senate
the Senate tax
committee.
Motion version didn't
like a lot.
But it wound up
being in
there.
And. That
particular bill I
think would be very
harmful.
To to you
all and
and in a long way to
the industry.
Does it mean we don't need to do
something. But
we need to do that
bill. But it
came that close to being in
in in what was in
they came that close to being
signed but it didn't
happen and
rightly show
do you guys I mean
can you kind of talk a little
bit about the
impact that might
have had on
you
as in as an industry
and and what do you SSI
I mean do you see any
idea is
that maybe would make
that more
palatable
to to you
get.
Because I'm afraid it's coming back
so I'm hoping everybody's
paying
attention.
You madam chair that
Senator Griggs I'd
I'd greatly appreciate you
bring that to the attention the committee and
it's certainly worth a
discussion
each one of us as small
producers
has.
Has a differential on
the excise tax that we pay
as local producers that is
not the same as but
out of state producers
pay right it is the
the leg up that you give us in order
to function and get our
businesses off the ground
and and it's scalable
as you scale up as a business
that that tax rate increases
and it gets closer to what
the the out of state
producers are paying
and.
I think that nationally
there's a lot of
concerns with regards
to.
Folks were putting
messages regarding
alcohol cessation
there is the World Health
Organization who's looking at
putting out notices that say no
amount of alcohol consumption
is good for you it's it is all
unhealthy
there are folks who look
at excise tax as a way to
control consumption or control
behavior
and I think that is a narrative
that's going to continue to come back
to the legislature I think
responsibility is something that we're all
concerned about and
responsible drinking is
definitely something
that we all as producers take
quite seriously
I don't know that
legislating behavior
through excise taxes going
to have the impact that I think that
the intent of the bill was
trying to propose
however I I certainly do
recognize the intention of
the
the the bill Sanchez
that they are looking for ways
in which we can become
all more responsible
to the citizens of New
Mexico.
I'm concerned that if
the differential for that
we have as producers was
changed it was normalized and
flattened out across
that the leg up with them to get into the
out of state producers and
no longer would you have an industry
in New Mexico that had
the opportunity to grow from
small businesses to large
businesses
instead by leveling
quorum court the playing field
you create an
unfair competition for
those larger businesses and and
most alcohol producers
from out of state that are importing into
New Mexico would be considered
macro producers the
largest of large producers
they have the ability to potentially
absorb these taxes
in a way that I do not think
the local industry would be able
to so
while I think the intention
was good I do
I do think it's great that we now
have the opportunity to have a discussion
that how do we get
to the intent of what the bill's
sponsors were trying to
to to to
achieve without
penalizing the small businesses
that we work so hard over the last
10 years to really
develop I I was part of
the first excise tax
change that we created for the craft
brewers back in
2013
and it was meant to be
a short term
will this work let's take a
look and see if we give
these brewers a break
will the industry
thrive will it
grow
and it certainly has had
that effect and
so much to the so that the
the members the legislature made a
permanent and I think
what we would see is
we would be backtracking on all
the great work that we've done
over the last decade to
really build up a craft beverage
industry if that
bill had passed if I'm
interpreting the same bill that you
were speaking
of.
And Madam chair
Senator creeks
I would also like to say that when we talk
about like data of what our in
home market sales are being able
to export
at changing those tax rates
definitely hurts like what we're
pulling through in the state our ultimate
goal isn't to sell more alcohol
in New Mexico clearly there's
not more consumers of selling
more doesn't doesn't make a
difference
and when I'm looking at our
typical consumer we have
3 drink limits at all of our
locations we encourage people to
take a growler home
rather than staying on I and
and those things we do
make higher and stuff
and so I feel like what
what we're really talking about we're
talking about problems of addiction
and living in Albuquerque
I mean I see people who are
are addicted and struggling every
day on the streets
and there's not a big
effort to
figure out outreach we
have the money it's
not the money they don't
care how much that fifth of
vodka costs it's
whenever they get enough money in
their hand to go buy it
and we're we're
not addressing that addiction
and those services the loss
of mental health providers in our
state and so
raising more money to
fix the not money
problem I don't
feel like really gets us across the
mark I know that that's not my
industry but
seeing seeing what I'm
seeing in the market it's not the
people that come and
who are going to pay $6
versus $80 for a B.
R. it's it's
thought lower tier and
getting the services to the
people in need and making sure that
they're available and that we have
providers and
making sure that people who
are
you know really struggling
aren't choosing to buy a fifth of
vodka versus a pack of diapers
for their kids because those are the
choices that I'm really worried
about.
The madam chair members of the
committee so I
you know that can emphasize
that the points enough that
that these 2 have made have
they're very valid but you know
also looking at just a dollars and
sense of running a small business
such as mine I can speak
to myself so when
this bill was being discussed
last year I had
just implemented my
first price increase in
the 5 years that I had been in
operation
because of increases of prices
across the board from
glass bottles are
seen at 20 percent price
increase post pandemic
labels 10 percent price
increase
and then you know raw materials
for for fermenting
and distilling seeing you know I pretty
significant increase and
so the the idea
that being faced
with the increased
you know excise tax
burden you know
what a business like mine would
do it either it would absorb
that internally and
not raise my prices or
raise the price on my
you know my my drinks in
the tasting room or on that
the liquor store shelf
pass it off on to the customers
and as a skied
mention we we
produce at a craft product
that we charge a premium
for
you know we we require
a certain amount of profit margin
just to keep our doors open that
larger industry
outside of the state
that you see here can
you know they can accept a much lower profit
margin on those products and so
we're competing already with that
you know I cheaper vodka
right next to our market for
instance and so
pushing that off on to the consumer
risks of what's called sticker
shock in the industry where
somebody comes in
used to buying a bottle for
$20 and
now we have to pass
that excise tax increase on
to the consumer in the bottles
of $28
and so what they'll do is they'll go
to the Tito's vodka or the
other out of state industries
so you that would
directly be targeting New
Mexico home grown businesses
that are involved in the
communities
you know we're hiring community
members if we're
don't. A into community organizations
things like that so
you know that's sort of where I'm seeing
this as a you know small
business.
And yes thank you for that and
madam madam chair I
mean kind of the
point on on
some of this is.
We've passed some laws
recently
that you will
I we're good laws
amendment talk about that
internet sales tax iterations
we thought it was a good
saying it's a good thing
for Albuquerque
maybe it's a good thing but
it but it had and an
impact on the
harms and and
Carlsbad because of
the way
things were are
done with
with that particular tax
and if we
go in and we and we
deal with this
one for the one that
was proposed.
The impact would have
been.
Probably a measurable
at the moment in may have been
very very damaging
because that was a
that was a bill that was
showing introduced
to increase
the price of alcohol
in order to
decrease
the consumption of alcohol
that's that's what it's purpose
what.
And.
Right or wrong.
We've got representatives of
businesses right here that may
have been at you
impacted
substantially from that
from that bill
and what would
they have lost what would New
Mexico lost
from that perspective.
You they're absolutely right
to preserve actually right we
talk about same gender
the the health
issues
we deal with the health
issues and possibly in a way
that you different
but but maybe
there are more reasonable
ways
to deal with
increases in
in alcohol
taxes.
That one which were
scattershot
and maybe there are a
shameful ways to
to do that
that that.
Help me with
the funding that
the sponsors were looking
for but
don't destroy
the people that
are engaged in industries
that are employed
that we all wish and don't
have employed in
maybe then they become part
of the problem that we're trying to
fix
which I look I look forward to
seeing what Startin
to mobile up
and hopefully some
good things will because
I'm. This one
I don't I don't know whether
it will be on this
session. But
he sure could be and
if it if it is I
hope that
you all in and
people like
Mr Thompson back there those
industries or or
engaged
in and talk
indicators we
certainly want to do something
that that
works that works for
for everybody in the Asian
Josh
be a a
punishment to some
and I look
forward to being part of that if
it's it's it all looked
makers for somehow I
I don't know why I went on
to have
an.
Have been more involvement
in liquor stuff than
I would have ever thought
ever ever ever.
But yeah we've
got some.
We have some challenges there and
I think we can still we can still
do some things infections
staff that make
it that where
people
can
have licenses that they
can and they can
afford and the
licenses that exist
that are high value
can still exist with
limited impact
and I I certainly believe
that. And I'm
I'm looking forward to seeing where we
go on some of these things
with you're sure you
guys noted as a
craft
day I
was over at shelf
rejuvenation in
London England
and they had a display
of whiskey
this one type of
whiskey.
One time they had
one. It'll
bottle.
710
pounds.
Sterling pounds sterling
for that one the law.
They're a bottle that was
about this
big.
95000
pounds sterling.
Sure you can future get
an
opportunity.
So there you go that's right actually
blue the thirteenth or something
