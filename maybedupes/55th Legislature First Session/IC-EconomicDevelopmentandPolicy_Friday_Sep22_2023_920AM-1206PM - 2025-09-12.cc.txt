Good morning Good Friday morning to
you hi
this is the economic in a
rural development policy
committee and senator Kerry
Hamblen serving as
chair of the committee this year
today we have a short day
even shorter since I was 20
minutes late to my own meeting my
apologies for that
we are finishing up for meetings
here with an update on forced
health in the logging industry
and then we'll and with a presentation
on agrarian economy of
economics and reminder
that there are 3
bits of legislation that we're just going
to do a really quick preview
to so
that it in
all honesty it's just so that we can
make sure that you are aware of
it and
those will be 3 bits of
legislation that we will vote

this kid committee to
consider
endorsing and
we'll finish off of public comment

committee today.
Thank you madam chair
and committee members good morning
and I'd like to thank everyone here for
coming and
the committee for inviting us to
return
my name is and receives I own a
okay forestry in the New
Mexico and this is
Russell Laney the owner
of timber tramp logging also
Linda we're both residents
of catching County and Russell
has over 50 years of experience
in the logging and lumber
industry.
So for years
stakeholders 0 in the
industry have warned of the
consequences of failure to chair
force responsibly and in
2023 you passed Senate
bill 21
unfortunately this action came
after the devastation of the
2022 fires
too little too late for those
impacted we're
coming to you today with
another warning and our hope is
that you will not wait until the damages
done to take action on these
matters.
So I'd like to start by asking the
committee to question is
what is a healthy properly
managed force look
like. Well
you reflect on this question I'd like to
share some thoughts with
you.
Our national forests are an important
part of our lives as Americans in New
Mexicans healthy
forces a place where we can camp
hunt fish hike
and Marvel at its
beauty as you
know Theodore Roosevelt is the father
of our national parks and was co
founder along with Gifford Pinchot
ought to create the United
States for service
the systems have been the inspiration
pinnacle of land conservation in
the world many were
leaders have been inspired by
efforts to protect our
natural resources
today we the
collective public but more
specifically stakeholders in the
forestry industry are
at the mercy of the for service in
the management of the forests
as I'm sure you're aware R.
Forster overgrown and pose a
significant risk of fire
you'll recall in 2022
New Mexico lost 660
6000 800
71 acres of forest
just to the black fire and
calf canyon hermit's peak fires
alone.
These are the most devastating fires in
New Mexico history and the were the
result of mismanagement by the
for service
management of our endorsed by
the 4 services primarily done
through timber sale contracts.
Today contracts are being
dictated by a skewed public
image image of the
industry environmental
groups are telling the for service to
stop cutting old growth
with the U. S. for services
currently having is cut is primarily
understorey logs
which are relatively quite young
compared to an average trees
lifespan in order to
preserve. What
older trees.
The long term result of this practice
is essentially a delayed clear
cutting.
Silas as most of
the trees they have us remove
belong to the same generation
over time the trees
left which are of a different
generation from those we cut
but in the same generation as one
another die off roughly
at the same time leading to a
force that does not have a diverse
age group.
Today timber sale contracts are not
as lucrative nor as effective
as the used to be for us to
purchase a sailing to be
profitable 60
percent of the trees need to have a minimum
diameter 16 inches at
breast height
we call this the B. H.
which stands for diameter breast
height the minimum
diameter allows
us to not only run our sawmilling
peeler but allow
also allows us
to remove the smaller trees for the for
service essentially
access to larger logs allows
us to 4 tough also
cut the smaller ones
for a sawmill 16
inch deviation great it
will provide the required
size of lumber that can be sold
in store
hurdle that we've encountered is
that according to the US for
service the definition of
us all August 12 to 16
inches D. B. H.
this falls into what we commonly
consider pulp wood which is
usable as fire would and in
some cases utility poles
but is unusable for
quality lumber.
What the US for services
generally so currently
soliciting for timber sales
consist of roughly only 30
percent trees 16
inches and greater DPH
trees we can sign a quality
lumber and 70
percent R. 15
inch and inches and
below public
many of these timber sales are going
on bid or bid in a way
that the lawyers who purchased them and
up taking a loss.
When this occurs the 4
service will offer the sale is a cuts
get index ale this
type of sale is when the
contractors bid per acre on
what they will charge to complete the work of
cutting dragging and stacking the
country's.
Where they are left until the 4
service hold a separate
exam the buyer
of the deck sale moves the logs
off the sale and does with them what they
well again these logs
are not profitable to
songs like ours
which is why we do not
bid on them.
Additionally the tax payer
and that paying for these types of
sales rather than the better
paying for the work as in a
traditional timber
sale.
So contractors like us would like
to continue to purchase timber sales
and sustainably log in a way
that is profitable for us
and for tax payers
by doing so we can increase our
workforce and provide opportunities
for individuals in our
communities.
Access to the appropriate trees
would allow us to open our sawmilling
peeler operation
and once again provide material
to not only our community
but the greater community.
If the 4 service wants the
force to be lobbed their
way there really isn't a
viable option for us other than
the charger per acre
price to cut skin and Dick
and further the
impacts of this process
on the health of the Forrester
generational as I
touched on
earlier.
Here's where the state comes in
the cuts getting Dick sales
require bonding outside of the
U. S. for service
we've had multiple US Forest Service
employees tell us that if they were able to
receive more financial
assistance from the state to pay
for the cuts skindex
sales they would be able to
provide those opportunities with
greater frequency
ideally we would have access
to the appropriate size logs
but cuts get indexing as would
maintain potential for us to
find jobs in our
communities.
The state has the ability to improve
the condition of logging and lumber
industries in New Mexico
the U. S. for services providing
grant opportunities to sawmills
for improvement or to re
open understanding
that many have become stagnant or
closed after COVID and the
costs of inflation
on the other hand
there leaving the logging industry
without grant opportunities for the
C. foreseeable future
making sawmill support less
viable over
time.
If New Mexico legislators can come
together make changes to the anti
donation clause you open the
door to make grants
available for the logging
industry with these
requests lawyers will be able to purchase
newer and more efficient equipment
that can make learning easier
faster and importantly
more environmentally
friendly. We
understand that National Forest are
federally managed but the
health of the forced in our state
impact your constituents.
With overgrown forests New
Mexico New Mexicans will
continue to suffer from drought
conditions and with
the burn scars that occur from
wildfires will continue to
suffer from flash floods and
risk of harm from dead standing
trees.
The legislators of New Mexico
have real power to make changes
for the better this is
a bipartisan problem
and requires the bipartisan
solutions of partnering with
the for service in
making cuts get index is
more readily available
changing the anti donation clause
to allow grants to be available for
the logging industry and
providing access to trees that will
allow some is to generate
profitable products.
So I'd like to circle back to my
earlier question for
me healthy forest
is one that is not overcrowded with
trees and provides open
grasslands for a wildlife to
thrive. A
force that we can co exist
with that provides resources
to us that takes care of
us for as long as we take care of
it and generations from
now has a diversity of
growth.
A forest ranger once again
is a great piece of wisdom
and I like to share that with
you. If you can
see a quarter of a mile through the
forest that's a healthy
forest if
you can't see the forest for the
trees that's a force
that needs help.
So if
anybody has any questions for us
I'm sure there are some
please ask
away thank you
appreciate that insight
and you know it makes
a lot of sense with
what you're talking about and so I do appreciate
you being here
Mr Lanier I don't know if there's anything you
want to tell us about your experience
as a as a longer and
and what you've
seen.
Well what what happened
is it.
The farmers is been
missed mismanaged.
This started
with the environmental
movement in
1993.
And the forces
overgrown.
A basically
stop to timber sales
forces over rooms
so this is causing these
catastrophic
wildfires.
And the
the 4 service started
now.
Trying to
do part of this with what they're
doing in ****
are taking out everything under
the I'm not
taking that into the bigger
trees basically
letter to take
3 of you all are
folks.
Stand out here.
And I thought they do is they
put only
paying on the Lee
Terry.
Okay I believe paying on
the country.
So your folks and yet
here put on staying
on the they call
your grant is pretty
there but Jim out
here paying
on what they're
doing is they're taking out the grand
kids in the myself
New Mexico peel and
gentleman.
There.
This is just not happening
for us.
In or areas
Pacific the.
We live in
no and they have
the the but is
already done.
It's all cleared.
We have ACC you
roses.
December available
there do this for
frustration
clearing out of the forest
to for students for for
is still is not
able to
for whatever reason I've got
my ideas.
To get the timber
sales.
As of last year
June.
Last year we have a male
and the we
have not run our phone
mail since
June of last year
last year we had 21
employees
today we've got for.
For the elector timber big enough
to run our mail.
What we're doing now is we're this
transport and
lotion from
the he the
forest
Authority here and on the
for firewood
and polls it is not
quality for the
or call the
polls we've
got all of this is there in
our for us
is that we can
get a hold of it and
then being able to for
us to operate
and manage.
We're able to find
jobs.
We supply to tumors
to different offices and
one in Albuquerque one
Bernalillo.
Hello we we haven't
been able to do
any of this for a
year just
because of the mismanagement
of the for for.
If they would
you know ideally
I'd like to see the state takeover
the force.
In the state
that the individual counties
take over their own
for.
And then as soon to create
a healthy for us I'm
not about their cotton
are I've been to
this is us 60 years
old. And I
want to be able to do is I've
got grandkids
and the Roose
detained this much
on all I've
got a 2 of the 2
daughters and 2 sons
hello I see them able to
continue to do this
all I wanted I want to healthy
for us the last
piece of healthy forest
in our area
code right up from the blue
river but as soon
to go to faster to come
on again
to you has to
be our next major also
are just
because of
mismanagement from for
for.
Thank you so much Mr landing
appreciate that.
We have Representative Armstrong
Senator Griggs Representative
Zamora and representative Duncan
also representative Armstrong
here ready to go
thank you madam chair and thank you
for your presentation that was
clear and concise
I think everyone
on this committee understands
that there is issues
with the for service
or you know even during the
catastrophic fires
trying to get help into the
areas
where they just let it burn
and it got away from.
One of the questions I had
was I know
a couple years ago when we were
working on this
with Purcell sero in
the as the call
manager or cog
a person is that the
nepa process was being held
up that they
weren't
processing the doing
the process quick enough
is that still the case or
did I hear you say
that the need is been
done.
This year yes ma'am the name
has been done
the store is a need for the
94 and
2014
for that area they just
clear to this is that
the.
The 0.5 ago now
only 2 years ago.
They got to the the.
It is the the need for has
gotten.
Way out of line.
And this needs to
be the
changes the.
There's so much that it
used to be
about a little
over a quarter inch thick paper
of our now
just
236
and that has to be done for each
individual area.
And then they've got to archaeological
sites and
and everything else goes with it
and so right well I was
curious madam chair
on the on
the size.
That was a complaint before as
well as the size of
the the pieces a point
that they were but the
blocks of for us that they
were being able to
open up for
for
for logging has this
is the size large enough
or is it
still.
Because what happens madam
chair is.
If the size isn't big enough for
them to go in and log it doesn't
make it feasible for them to go
in there and do that
so what we are pushing for was
to get a larger
section auctioned off
at each time or option
you know
put out for bid so was the
size
also been
enlarged no
they did with the just the
sale we're out there
on the stage stayed
on the court
there's too contracted in New
Mexico 3
contacted in error
zona.
And there they just on the
sale just yesterday
$450.
And that hundred 50 those
lasts about
every 6
months to 6 weeks
I contracted I've
been on I won't lose a piece of
material because
that's the only one
available at
this point and
so it's been made available
so far this year
and there's a possibility
of one more small on
this year and nothing
else.
Rest of the time in
and as I think most
you understand
we have to bid on those
sales yeah
we don't they don't just give it
to we got a bit
on yes Sir thank you
for that and and just
a reminder to go through the chair
just say madam chair if
you don't mind just just as
protocol I should have told
you that before I apologize
so it sounds like
to meet can you explain
a little bit for people that may not
know what is cut
skin and Dick.
Madam chair.
Of what.
Yes given that can drive
from was
the photos and
timber sales
that were economically feasible
of it all. And
they were putting out for bid
a warm bit on the
side brought back out
and they.
The 4
service.
Has an area for the same
sale what they
do is a.
Thank you so much an
acre to get
excuse isn't deck
is.
And
this last one is a
done up here
for whatever reason
we had a bid for item
50 per acre
they are all going had a bit
for 12 owners
per acre 12 they got
the bid but
anyway they took over
here to the
finish the contract
by the time they got the contract
on the tumor was no
good and
so
sieve go wasted deal
that could be much more efficient
but that's what it is
is actually
you get paid.
To do the work
as opposed
to.
The path through the make of the
judges of the way thank
you for that I could you just give
me madam chair
the definite what
explain what cut
skid and deck is
the process
Madam chair what is
is a.
Designate what
do they want to have
the.
The beauty of
mark with blue paint
you're going to.
The half $0
machine because I'm down
she in postmenopausal.
The state is here going
along picks up all the
takes to the road
the prosecution
ever try to reload
fix at all the
processes into log
links take sent
off president
of these is there for us
to print by
our
contractor.
Thank you for that that's I just
don't think a lot of people
here knew what that what you meant
by that so thank you for that
explanation
and so
we are talking about
madam chair more state funding
would that be to the state
forester.
Yes that
that would be sued through
the state for free.
Division.
And there is
has.
Of their own funding
this year they're supposed to be to
do most of
already. All
right foot out to
contracts
this fall and now they've postponed
until next spring
which is just as
of these
contractors in order for
this fall thank
you madam chair thank you for that
to I am
personally going to look into why
are they putting those on hold
we just did madam chair
big tour
of everything that they're wanting
to do with the
legislative
thing was legislative finance
committee and you know
they're what they're asking for
millions.
Of dollars I want to
say maybe
someone can at the table can
remember but I
want to say they're asking for a
5060
$0 to
expand.
Things that don't include
this.
And so if we're not
even managing this
correctly at the state
level
I'm gonna personally look into
why. As
we watch our state burned down
around us.
And the other
thing madam chair this is economic
development this is
these are the the faces
Madam chair of the people
that are in catching County and
other counties that
wanted state
there live there and
this is the reason why
they've invested time energy
effort money
children grand
children. Into
the county that want to
live 8
work and play there.
And be
educated.
And so.
We're talking about economic development
but we're talking about tying
one handed one foot behind
their back and pass
on to make a living
as they take out
loans. To
buy the equipment to set up
to follow all the
rules.
And and this is
how.
And this is the first time that
they have presented madam
chair.
And so I don't know how
much more we need to say
or do but everybody
at this table.
Better get on board
are you gonna see rural New Mexico
go away.
Thank you for your commitment and
yes point call
in that
madam chair
the state
ought to go talk to the bank we don't
let it is amber.
See how it goes or.
We had to do
it.
Thank
you.
Okay you madam chair
I can just state that
we also
get sale
information from different
forces for just
like the Coconino the
Kaibab in the staff.
They put out sales
that when you get those
awarded you
have a term like of 3
years of
work the
sales that we're getting on the
healing we're lucky
if we get 3 months
and I don't understand
why.
So the Apache stick graves
is in the same region
and they do stuff differently
there than they do on
the list so I'm not sure
why this is such a
problem on the
healer.
Thank
you.
Madam chair thank you I'd I'd
like to circle back a little
bit from my
presentation last year
a little bit as Gil had
mentioned with the fires.
So last year I worked on the
reclamation efforts from
the calf canyon plan
cat canyon hermit's peak
fire.
And.
I'm not proud of the amount
of money that was made on
that fire.
As taxpayers
yourselves and taxpayers your
constituents are.
The amount of money that is wasted
on for service
fires.
Is a number that
is.
Incomprehensible when you actually
hear it
so I'll tell you exactly how
much I had made in
19 days and
14 days of those
were actually
productive and
I worked for 2:00 hours a
day at the most on
that fire
$97000.
For 19 days.
$97000
for 19 days that include
our travel fees in our per diem
but regardless
$97000
and.
That's taxpayer
money.
Along with that doesn't
go directly going
to our local economy most of the
time
you would not believe how many
contractors come from out of
state
Wyoming
Montana
Oregon California
Washington.
They drive across the United States
to call the fire chasers because that's
all that they do and is a very lucrative
business and it
really shouldn't be you know
we we should be able to protect our
force before it's a
fire
the other thing I'd like to address that
you may not know because
usually those sites are closed
very little work is done
in general by anybody
the 4 service prolongs
the fire fighting
efforts because
they make more money
and their contractors make more money
and there is a level of nepotism
involved in that as a
creating
different.
They have different leadership
that will take over on the fire
and certain leadership for
for certain companies
and so when there's a leadership
change we could
have stayed on that fire but the moment the
leadership is changed a late every
they removed everybody from the fire
hired completely new
careers.
So I just
want just wanted to bring that up
for you thank you and
Andrea I made
it as part of this conversation
do we have
enough state
and local folks to do
this to where people from
out of state don't get access
to these budget.
The gas
use.
Madam chair let me give you an
example here
12 years ago when they had
the.
The.
White water
volley fire
we work in that
area. They
come over and tell us what we need to
move back a little bit
because they were going to come in and
back burn they
moved back to more than a
back burn fire
okay so as to move out of
this open place we
moved out into this open
place and
just as we got out in the
open place here
comes a truck by from
Montana hold
on the exact
it is Jack model
exact errors the
peace we quit line on his truck
going to the fire
the farmers rest
there. And
we were
not.
You have to sign that's building
fires you have
to have a certain
quality of equipment to
be on the fire
unless you're actually
in the higher echelons
is pretty hard to get on the
fire it is used
to be they take
whatever they can get especially
the locals but not
anymore.
I appreciate that I don't understand why we
can give New Mexicans
priority on any
of these well madam chair the
other thing is is is not
just on the fires but
if and it's like
Mr Laney said you know they had
5 people
bidding on setting
that forest
and and
and and it is spending
madam chair it's not rape and
pillage it's funding
and and it's making a
better watershed it's it's
really allowing the forced
to grow but not in a manner
that could
be detrimental if there was
a fire started.
But for 5 people to bid on
that and and
for the highest bidder to get the
bid that's an
issue I mean it should
in the state agencies should
always be the lowest
better.
But with the
qualifications
and.
So we have 5 people betting on
this little tiny piece of
forest that would last 3
months.
And so I think and
I think it's a federal issue to open
that up higher it's
not to a larger piece of
a. It would be great
if they could build a piece that would last
a year.
I mean I don't I don't want to work
someplace where I can I am
might only be able to work 3
months and then you don't know where your
next paycheck is coming from
so thank you so much for
your commitment
to rural New
Mexico thank you madam chair
thank you Representative
Senator Griggs and then
Representative Zamora
representative Duncan Representative
Lujan.
Thank you madam chair and
you know thank you guys for
coming in and talking to us
today our
management of the national
of the national force.
Has been a colossal
failure.
I think there's no way
no way you can say anything
different. Are
the only people
who
can get things as
screwed up as the
4 service can
and still have their
jobs our
weather man.
Just.
It's just that
way.
Madam chair and engaged in
the in the Hilo which is where I'm
guessing you work
mainly
or the trees primarily
ponderosa pine or or
what are the trees in
the.
The majority of the trees that we're
logging are ponderous
fine occasionally
run through a little bit of Douglas fir
but it is primarily
like 99 percent of the
spine are not that
ponderosa pine excuse me
okay.
Okay
the healer contains madam
chair I think somewhere somewhere
in the neighborhood of about 3000000
acres the the national
forces
maybe more the
link and I think is about
1000000 then we
have the Carson and we have the
Santa Fe I think we have one
other national force
in the in the state.
And.
We're just waiting
we're just waiting
for the
state to burn
up.
It doesn't matter the
cars whether to
prescribed burn whether
it's lightning whether it's
whatever it might be
we're just waiting for
that to happen
we've let it go
to a point to
where we.
We honestly can't fix
it unless we
operate
more.
Feigning
operations
average kind of it's going
to run as the people that live in the
forced every
day are faced
with the fact that they get home
every night and be blessed
with the fact that they get a house
didn't burn them.
Because it's.
It's just amazing
how they she's gotten to the
point it has
gotten to
I live in Alamogordo.
And show yeah
I see it every day
with Cloudcroft in
the rear the ocean
in the places around there than in
Lincoln you know I've
been I've been here where
you get you get
fantastic views
across the healer
were you just here where you can see all
the trees are just gorgeous
absolutely gorgeous.
But there's way too many
tree.
And it's I mean these fires when
they get to go on or
pretty much
unstoppable.
And you know
the that's why the
berm show many acres
is you. You just
can't get your arms
around.
The
legislature.
The legislature did something
this year which
has been you know maybe didn't
have a big effect maybe it'll have
impact some day down the
road but
the the
legislature
voted without a no
vote on the floor of both
allergies.
To support Senate bill
21.
Just say bill 21 you say
you can't conduct a prescribed
burn during a red flag warning
or started when that happened
and so the is that a big
deal you know more
likely not but it's a
message sender if
nothing else madam
chair to the to the
4 service
primarily
is try to do your job
right.
But I think I think
madam chair Nish this next
statement might be kind of
I don't have everybody look
at 8.
But.
Recently the the
governor.
Utilized her emergency
powers
to
to to do some staff up
in Albuquerque.
If you want to see an emergency
in New Mexico.
You look at the forced
that's an emergency.
The governor of New Mexico
has every right
to sit there and protect
the people that live in New
Mexico and to
protect the forced
utilizing her
emergency powers
your
federal.
Representative and
they've been you know Democrats
Republicans the
Democrats and Republicans all
across the all the way
they have been unable.
Been unable
to do anything with
the for service to make
sure it manages force
correctly.
Utah has led the charge
for years to
try to bring
all.
All the federal lands in
Utah
back to
you to all the western
states are the only stage
madam chair in the country
that have large
concentrations of
federal land
federally controlled land
within their boundaries.
One day
one day in New
Mexico.
Should you 9 with
all the rest of the
west and figure
out how we can bring that
land back
to state
control.
If nothing else
if nothing else for
the fact that when you
have operations
on BLM over an
oil and gas country madam
chair you give
up about
52 percent
of the revenues from
oil and gas operations
owned that federally
controlled land.
How much revenue is New
Mexico meshed out
over time
because that
BLM
land were oil and
gas is recovered
from.
New Mexico
gets 48
percent.
And that's at the whim of the federal
government they may
not get that next
time but
the. Yeah all
I I appreciate what
you're what you're doing I I
appreciate what.
What you're talking about I
think it's great that you're
coming to talk to members
of this
committee we need to be talking
to members of every
committee.
These these people to
New Mexico's history
they've been here they
worked.
Their families have worked
hard here for
years.
And we're doing the
state not as bad
but the federal government to and everything
they can to run
you guys all.
Federal government is doing everything
it can to run everybody
off the forced.
I don't even know madam chair
that the federal government wants
recreation
on the force.
So I I think
as this legislature
members
we need to continue to
be aware of what you're seeing here
today.
And how can we
we yeah we
shud damning in Lordsburg
we show everyone
come here yesterday talking
about what they feel like
they need to help
them just
be successful
where they can continue to live
and damning in order
for.
We're seeing more people
appear in Silver City as
well who want to live
in reserve 11
of living in
a all the little communities
up and down through the
years.
And we're helping the federal government
do what it can to
run people like these
out.
Our representatives
in Congress for failing
you.
They're failing this
state because
they you 98 with
special interest groups
who they believe
have a better hold
on the values of New
Mexico.
We all need to get tired of
that. We need
to understand that we live
here this is our
state.
We need to take it back
from federal over
reach in areas like
this.
And I'm gonna stop
before I can to go war
and I I
want you guys to know that I should
point you 0 percent there's ways
I can help and
I I want you to know that
every member up here
every member of
peer.
Shined on their right side
on that they voted for Senate
bill 21.
Sure we should point here
in some way
hopefully we can support you in
Warsaw thank you madam
chair.
Thank you very much senator grace and
thank you for all your work that you did on
that bill. That was
a tremendous effort that
you're
actually.
We have Representative Zamora
representative Duncan and then
Representative Lujan Representative
Zamora.
Thank you madam chair and
presenters.
There's no question.
As to what we're doing today is it
working.
We've got a long ways to go because
we're way behind.
On what we should've kept
doing years ago and because
of.
A certain species are
conservation or whatever
we we just dropped
the ball.
And we shouldn't have
done that that's that's
a big mistake we've got a long
ways to go to catch
up.
In in when you talk
about thinning down the
forest.
Is there just certain kind
of. Trees you
can use or
like can use the the
cedars for anything or
the the Pina owns
or.
What. Is there just
certain kind of trees that you
guys are after.
Madam chair members of.
We
up.
All falls all ties can
be utilized.
But our situation
is basically just
for fun rules of
provide for
spruce that kind of saw
timber we
provide
a.
The outfit in
Arizona.
With over 5000
cords career
of of timbre
the state spends
of into far would
that's fine but
it has to be a certain side and
figure they can make you
money split
and also
the the the there
you started now
to do a poll the ill
they used to make calls all of
our first
telephone poll of
polls there is
a chemical used for the US no
longer available
so now there you
find 0
or situation but
it takes almost the sixties
deviation Fund
to make a 50 foot
pole that's
78 those are
limits on 63 we
use Mason
basically fund for
what we use for our so
so madam chair members
of the committee and and presenter
so that that
leaves a big part of
our state to cedars
if am I correct in
being and saying
that.
The madam chair
non not
not in our area
there's quite a bit
do for their
and the.
It's.
Actually have the
disqualifier
really bad wealth are groove
back up in juniper
raising grasslands
and courage to
the. And
and madam chair
and.
Mr
Russell.
Mr Mr
Laney.
Madam chair Mr Laney
so if you're
awarded a
contract.
To to thin a certain
part of the force you have to call
for an archaeologist
to come in and and clear
that am I correct.
No Sir the
for first does all of
that for the
put to bid up yes
that's to be done
they have the
yeah this is so
conservation is to
have the the L.
yield all of us
the issue the
the all and and
I have a
hard okay and
and madam chair and members
of the committee up I'd like
to bring up a an
important
interesting thing that happened to
me well I
owned a ranch south amount
more.
And
when we do standing on our
private ranches
which is some of it is is
funded from the
federal side and I
don't know if some of state side
or not. And I
might have that confused
but when we do
that then in on our
ranch we had
to get an ark ark
clearance which is an archaeological
clearance if there's any
kind of shards
arrowheads pottery or
anything found
those sites are not to be
disturbed and those
rules
are behind
their times because.
I had a neighbor
rancher that
said that him and his
brothers when
they grew up on the ranch
50 years
we're talking a 50 year time
period back.
They had built fires and
stacked rocks and they'd
camp out at this place
and they cut the the archaeologist
would come in and call it an
oxide.
And it wasn't on our side
it was it was recent
and it was stuff that they did
themselves as kids.
So those places were
not to be disturbed
and then on top of that
if you
asked.
For certain part of the
ranch to be cleared
permission to to get
cleared.
We didn't have enough archaeologist
in the state of New Mexico
so it might take me 6
months or a year
before the archaeologist got
out there and clear the
site.
So we
need as a state
to look at.
Attracting some archaeologist
and having them ready and and
get these things done quicker
I don't know how if
the federal people have
people contracted here in the state
and stuff but I know
in the private side of
it it was hard to get
done and it would take for
ever for you to get an
application through
because all the the
archaeologist would hold it
up.
And.
I think.
As a state we ought to be looking
at.
They they have these giant machines
are called masticating.
And they can actually shredded
tree down into
mulch and
we see it done on on
private ranches
there's no reason why we shouldn't
be looking at the
maybe some of the trees that you can't
use I'm not
for masticating good trees that
you can use and and and
be productive for not
only the state of New Mexico but
your communities in
your
family.
And why can't the state
of New Mexico
attract.
Pellet
production.
We have pellet stoves all
over this country now
people use of left and
right
maybe a family like
yours that has worked in the force
could go into a pellet
production business support
he could produce pellets
and. I
I know I drove by a site
in Arizona one time and they
were they were making pellets
for pellet stoves I
don't see anything like that in the state
of New Mexico it had
big create
jobs.
If they are forced to.
Kill 2 birds with one
stone.
And that's all I have
madam chair and presenters thank
you thank you for presented
today. Madam
chair on
the Bellagio there's
a that is huge
on.
Discussed well it's not just
across state lines over
and over show
low and lot of
the really small
to ensure we
take it to
basically be
in on the hill is out of
our transportation
range and
so it makes it really costly
for us to have to do that
also
like.
Mr Morris and
they're that they're
they've been talking a little
bit of values and some of
the.
The she's
to mulch
with on the juniper.
Side of stuff in doing
some but you know
this is happening
thank you for I
I appreciate your comments that
you want to go
ahead.
Just as far as the public
thing to
when they start the pellet
mill starting
up and shutting it down
is quite a process
so when they start
running it they running 24
hour shifts.
We can't get
enough timber to run
a sawmill in lieu
New Mexico.
Where would we get the material
to run a pellet mill
in New
Mexico.
It appreciate that
you know I think we all share the
same frustration is when
people who are doing
things in their communities and
working for their living is
that
there systems in place that make
people feel like they're walking through
mud.
And that's the thing
I think we all want to try
and remove is
that feeling or that whole
experience of walking through mud
because we know that you know what
you need to do you
know what needs to happen in order for
you to be able to continue doing
what you're doing and
when we hear the stories of all
these barriers that are put up in
front of you it's
frustrating for us
because there are some things that
federally we can
go ahead and have conversations
with our congressional delegation
on behalf of you.
And then there are some things that we can do with
the state to try and at
least thin that might a
little bit for
you
you know if I may Senator
Diamond Brantley we're talking about
the the legacy
fund SB
9.
And seen Aaron's going
to kind of explore that a little bit
for you to see
where there might
be some things in that bill that
might be helpful
but I do think that
these are incredible and
important conversations
that we're having when we understand
that really I mean when we think of
an industry in New
Mexico
logging is not one the kind of rises
to the top right it's kind of what it's
one of those it's been long in
our state but
when we if we were to look at the
top 3
that's not necessarily something that easily
pops into somebody's mind and
so it's important
that you keep that conversation
up on that top and I'm
grateful for you to do
that.
Madam chair thank you
I I did want to kind of
come back as a
Representative Zamora did
speak on masticating
equipment
you know and and part of that
you know as I said
earlier what
would be most very beneficial
for us
since the for services providing
grant opportunities for someone
else the system
is don't get supplied
there's no point in that
and then again and so I
said that New Mexico has a very
unique opportunity in order
to provide those
opportunities
to the
logging
community.
I know that one thing
that was discussed previously
and I'd mention was the anti
donation clause because you can't
donate the money
directly
what could be done as an
alternative and we had actually had
this discussion the way the 4
service does their requests as they
own the equipment and
you use it until
the value reaches less
than
$5000
and then you can retain
ownership of the equipment
so that may be a way to get
around
the anti donation clause
temporarily but that's a
very big hurdle because
the domesticate
or.
Starts at
around
I believe
$375000
for a new one
and I don't know a whole lot of people that
can afford to pay that out of pocket
and that's a pretty big loan
so if there is a way to
to assist the
logging community
with those requests for
newer equipment that
be very helpful the other
thing that we run into
is.
Our trees the ponderosa
pine here are very different
from trees north
of us like you think of logging in the
Pacific Northwest in the northern part
of the United States
those trees
are very
straight very tall
with very small limbs
up high and so when
you have a processor that runs
through those
it it goes through very
easily cuts off all the
limbs cut it to size
loaded up and it
takes very little time
to to deal in
New Mexico trees ponderosa
pines have limbs that
go down as low as 3
feet from the ground
and you know bigger
than my wrist
and that is much more
difficult for a machine
to process through and so you
need more specialty
equipment for that
you specific
machines
so one once again that would be
very beneficial for the logging
community to be able to
supply these other
industries to supply
sawmills to supply
our our
lumber industry and as I I'd
seen on the hand out
that of topic
that was supposed to be brought up was
the lumber
micro industries
and in New Mexico
we are part of that
as long as we can supplier
sawmill so we we are
not only aware of the
logging aspect we're very aware
of the sawmill and of it
as wristlet stated
before we send lumber
to Albuquerque and
Bernalillo
2 major companies
there that specialize in
right rough cut lumber.
We haven't been able to provide for
them since July
June of last
year.
So again it please
bring that into consideration
to to
make those changes for
us.
Thank you so much and.
Representative Duncan and then
Representative Lujan.
Thank you madam chair
if you'll indulge me
for a few seconds
here I'm gonna go on a soapbox.
As the mayor of a small town
who has
been severely
impacted by the closure of
mines and power
plants.
That young man in the middle there
is not talking about
staying in New Mexico.
His next choice is to go to
Arizona maybe
you to
and their grandkids gonna go
with. So we're
not talking about an industry
that that
you know you can you just up and
quit and
and go to
doing some else tomorrow
you've got to years years
invested in this and
so as a
as a more of a community that
is seen family after family after
family leave my
community and go to
other states because
there's jobs in other states
that's exactly what we're doing
to learn we're
saying what you're
doing now really
not of top our list
so we'll stop
by in Arizona and see
on our way
through.
Madam chair if we if
we don't do something here
then
11 thing that we
set ourselves up as and
we
we see the commercial after
commercial after commercial inviting
people to come to our beautiful
state.
The next thing we should put on that is
come per pupil state and see
the burned out
areas.
That's what we're going to have
I hunt I fish I hi
hi hi
I bike
and I absolutely love
that and I don't want to lose that in our
state. So
now ask some questions thank
you for allowing me my
soapbox
can you tell me again.
How
many
contracts have been let in the last
year maybe 2
years in the
heat of the has 3000000 acres
on madam
chair
the.
The.
This year.
It's been one.
Who's supposed to have been to
administering
in the state.
Just around funding of one
done this fall
that contracted
consists of
a.
This 2 of
those issues
here for
2012
thanks to.
Good to the workings
of the axes
the 5000
CC of.
We continue to
contend with that is to
that chair CCS
as QB coach
the okay
it takes 7.2
Q. redundancy to make on
some of those.
Okay who are
ordinarily our
company last
year we had
to downsize
we could do somewhere around
about 2000
CC F. or not to
the to the
121212
15000
CCS per year
the sale was.
It is just a
really really insignificant
within it have
any.
Sales last year what we ended
up doing last year
was activities of for
for for under local fourth
graders came to us
and ask is if we would do the
fuel break on
the south side alone.
And so it.
The the
do you like the
which is Jessica.
Very just as they do the outside
mounted on market
they tell us what they want out of
it so it's 12 aces
alleys of those 2
of fuel breaks
just to keep us
work and we're
making money off of them
but we kept the 4
people that we still
have now one of
the like to emphasize
also is the
the 4 people we've got
working for us now
Persico subject our very
own guys
and they all have wives and
families.
We had 21 people
workforce last
year they were
good people.
They were trained by us in
order to get people
who issues related mall
they got another job
committed the
jobs and ages when
there's no next day
our own they're gone
so soon youth orders
come back as is well we got
to now we don't
hello. He
does it in the
madam chair thank you madam
chair can
you put in to
acreage how much that
was I I'm I'm
trying to quit we have 3000000
acres of of
timber and how many
acres was
that they did
basically it takes
about.
633
correlated new
the.
The.
One load of of
long to do so
for the most part we can do
a I get the
number right it
her.
30 closed.
To 1500 acres
here of the
5050
0 they could hear
yeah 15000
acres here when we had
our tool to approve the
loan.
Full details
we could do a lot of
for frustration.
If the for purposes
let us.
Into the for sure we can do
the thank you madam
chair my point is you
didn't even do.
One percent.
Of what the forces if
that were the case on this one
bit so thank
you for that.
I would love to help
out and I would love
to say let's put some money to
this my
concern madam chair
is can we be
assured that the for services
going to put that money to
use are they even
get a let contracts
out and and that's
my concern I'm
all on board for helping
we need to help
otherwise like I said
we're gonna have commercial
the state comes have burned out
areas so thank
you madam chair and thank you for your
presentation thank you
Representative.
Representative Lujan and then
Representative little.
Thank you madam chair thank
you get for presenting
today I
mean a big thank you for the
work because it is a
dangerous when the
most dangerous jobs out there
and so there that
is associated with some the cost
but as you mentioned
and you some of
those.
Those big price tags
that we put on on some of the
work and we're not
utilizing from
within so
I. propri Representative Santa
Fe County but I'm I have
family and I'm from northern
New Mexico very
involved with the calf
canyon number its
peak
after Masser of
what's been going on really bringing our
communities together I've I've
been talking with DFA been trying
to figure out a lot of things
when things are going wrong and I'd like to say
that our governor spent a whole
I think under 4 days or
something up there more to just a couple
weeks ago
because we're diving
in to really
trying to solve what is going
on and it's most of
it is
communication.
And madam chairman if you know this and
you probably do but
that money if
we have it wouldn't if we
wouldn't have done that we wouldn't
have money to leverage the
federal government to
repay or get
the projects done.
That that are really liking
right.
There's a lot of effort there's a lot
of people working on these things but it's a
communication thing I want to say thank you
for the work you're doing I
really would challenge us
to come together and I think the
leadership was Senator Griggs and
others Senator Campos
and Senator list of
phonics
Representative I'm discussed yeah
no Representative
Joseph Sanchez coming
together on these and others from
this these
areas to come together to work with
you to make sure that we get a plan
for
in an innovation bill
is kind of what I'm looking at
we ought we know when I spoke
yesterday that we're going to need another recovery
type bill or
planned because we're gonna have
more force fires
we really need to focus this is a
crisis is due to
climate change this
is due to a lot of things that we
have put on the back burner so
to speak and
I think that you coming
forward and giving us an update
we spoke with you last
year and I want to thank
you for for giving us all that
information but it it's true
what's been going on even up in the
north and and they're bringing
in folks from all
over all over the states
and there are locals
that have.
The ability have the machinery
and want to work
and so we intervene until
we started talking and coming
forward those measures
and there's 2 degree still not
happening.
So we need to
really come together and figure
out how this is how we're
going to mitigate this
because we
are we are headed down this
trail that this is going to
repeat itself
and we
have your wisdom at
hand and I think
you know what you're hearing from
all of us at the for all involved in
want to do this work
I I just say
that you know how do we
do that how do we bring everybody
together to really come
up with this innovation in this type of
legislation because this
is this is going to take policy
this is going to take us working together
and and
obviously our governors involved
in and wants to and
has been leading on this and
and really entertaining
as much as she can to with
our federal government needs to
come. Come
to us and they have to degree
you know to what they can do but it's
gonna take a long time because that's
just FEMA.
So thank you for
for this I'd like us
you know from the work in the
the messaging it's been done
today and and other
days of for us to really come together
to take the task force madam chair
but if if that's
something we need to do the
comes on this committee I know the LFC
did the task force we got the
$6000000
last year if we
need to do something economically
challenging from what from your
committee I think that this
is this is a great challenge
and it's a it's
a.
We have the innovation to do
this and I don't know what to call other
than that but we
we know what we need and we
know what we
can do so it's going to
take that the hand of policy to do
this thank you madam chair appreciate
thank you Representative
Lujan I don't know
if Senator Diamond really wanted
to respond or you want to go ahead have
separate.
Okay because Representative little and
then Senator done
correctly.
You want to respond okay
thank you Mr chairman
Representative Lujan I I appreciate
that we definitely had a good
conversation last year about
this I was
definitely holding on to
when you asked what we need to do
to come together on
this.
And if you'll excuse
me for being so forward
either decisions are
made
for.
The forces gonna burn that's that's
really what it boils down to that's what needs
to bring everybody together
homes and livelihoods will be
lost if
nothing changes so
if if nothing else
if you're on even
on the fence at all
that's probably
the top priority to consider
thank
you.
Thank you madam chair
thank you so much for the information
you presented this morning
this is the
new
no not quite completely
new but as an industry
I'm learning a lot of good
thing I have a lot more
questions to take away and
to do some research on my
own so I
appreciate everything that you've brought
up today and and some
of my questions actually were answered
asked by my colleagues and I
appreciate that very
very much the 2
that I have
are.
Can you tell me you were describing
the of the
acreage in
force lands so
when we're talking about
you're telling describing
the those
trees that are going to that marked
for cutting and those that are
marks to the to
remain. Can
you tell me is there an
ideal ratio
of old to new
growth it would you
happen to know
that.
Madam chair representative little
thank you
pretty will equal parts
you know if it if it was just
generally a 30
each as each
generation mentored
you could harvest that
generation in the following generation
would would be next
up in
line.
The wonderful thing about logging
that I I think is
a little overlooked
is a part of our
process of skating which is dragging
trees from one
location to the other
as they're dragged across
the ground and their seeding
the ground for future
generations and so
this is a
renewable source
of of industry and
it's a renewable source what it what
is an resources concrete
is not you can't grow concrete you can
grow trees and
so.
Yeah just having a really an
equal part would be most
ideal for the forest.
Thank you very much madam
chair I would have never known
that thank you for
that information the last
piece at my last second
question as
helping me to understand what
cut skindex sales
are I was looking
on my phone I apologize but I was
trying to find the definition for
that and my
understanding and
correct me if I'm wrong that
those are trees that
are have been cut
but I just stay there and
are not being gathered to
take out or at
that please correct me if I'm
wrong.
Then. Representative
little thank you for the question
obviously this is not
it's a it's a term that
not a lot of people are aware of so
I I'd be more than happy to clarify
that for you have any questions
cut skidded and Dick
are where you
go in so you you
bid for this as
we mentioned the per acre
cost you
go in with a what's
called the filler bunter
ours is a wheeled
machine
if you think of.
Basically a front end loader
but have here in lower to
the ground and has a
circular cutting disc on the
front it's about 2 feet
across thank you the girl
grab on to the trees you cut him
down dropping down
and then the skater which
is basically a
taller version of that
has a set of grapples on
the back on a boom
and they come down and they grab the
trees and you drag them to
another location a central
location where there
is a piece
of processing equipment
processing equipment there's
quite a few different types
ours are
tracked so
like an excavator
actually both in would be on an excavator
platform one of them
has a the
boom from the excavator and it has
a head that
has to to with
wheels and knives
on it the other one
has a telescopic
arm so what it does that drugs
that with the 7 knives and it
runs out from
it and it comes back in to cut it
and they both have a saw so
what you do is you you go through that
process you get to the final piece of
equipment it deal
ends the tree
cut it to size they get
put into a dak and
normally we would
a deck is just a pile of trees
and normally we would
low those onto a truck
and haul them off ourselves
what with the cuts
getting Dick which is
exactly what it is you just pile
it up and you leave those
trees there
those trees can then be sold
later and 8
what's called the decks sale
so somebody will later on
bid on
what they would like to purchase the tax
for
so right
now where we're
working we're working on
the
the end of a cut deck is getting
we're just loading logs
for another contractor and
hauling it to their location in
Arizona.
Thank you
madam chair
that I appreciate
that.
The clarification and
the the
details and
yes I would like to learn more
about this this
piece thank you madam chair
those are my 2 questions
thank you so much and am familiar
with a lot of the equipment just because of
the A. S. M. R. videos that
you'll see eve you
know and just it's a
fascinating
fascinating industry in terms
of the equipment the tools
that you get to play with
super
jealous
but.
If you'll see that
representative of a lot of
just a more videos will just
take him to a band saw will
take him through it
it's fascinating
yes if I may
I just like you guys
information one
piece of logging equipment
costs you about what is home
now
costs.
So you have to have
several pieces of logging
equipment or so
there's a lot more money invested
along side
there is just for us is
just quickly
here your
process started
$750000.
New in down
years cutters
gonna be $500000
or Skinner's going to be
$300000
and now even
today log
trucks or get up to
$200000.
Thank you and pretty much are
to really just
from the beginnings of
logging it's like a lot of
this equipment now is really taking
what used to be at the sawmill
really out into the field to make
it more efficient.
No no no not really
okay no no
no the
the you
still all be done
by by by
hand.
Is it basically is
a low I'm
not.
I for vision
contracting or follow for
about about
3 years unless
we don't at all all
lands for getting
on the ground they donated
and all of them
but the when
you. Now
but the labor issues
to we don't of
course going to we
only use we can
afford to go by
2 $3000000 equipment
the equipment and then
the in the woods
is. Just
in the and
then the equipment to
mail the only
real we'll
initiate that is
a is a
movie maybe a forklift
and and the for
in a front end loader
rest as they get basalt
but the other
state committee well
does to you for doing that all by hand
for so long that's amazing
incredible back breaking
work the thank
you senator Jim Bentley want to finish
this off. Thank you
madam chair I just wanted to follow
up a little bit on on some stuff
that Representative
at terra Lujan
had head start discussing mainly
because we're sitting here in the heart of the
Hilo forest well
it's true that that the northern
fire areas
received over $100000000
in state funds
in addition to the federal
dollars that were coming and
because the fire was started by
federal sort fat you just
for service there is additional
revenues in response
to the largest most catastrophic
wildfire that the Hewlett
has ever experienced last year at
the black fire we
had 0 federal
really federal agency
step in to help and
when in addition and and
and you know
comparison to the 0
that the legislature allocated to
the northern fire only
2 was
allocated to the black fire
yesterday I missed interim committee
because I was meeting with my local
local local stormwater district
to see how much of that money is on
the ground not
surprising to many of us 0
so it's been a year since the fire
and state government is now
the delays in getting this money
out and so that's where
we as legislators can
commend our local
entities that that are housing
that money on the Sierra side of this
mountain is a C. R. so on water
conservation district
the the headache that they're having
is they have to ask
for permission from DFA
for every single project
before it's the money is
issued out every single time
they want to turn around remember this is in
response to an emergency
and in addition in addition
that money here in the state
is reimbursable
so they have to come up with the
money first make the pay
out and then ask our state
agencies to reimbursement
for some local municipalities
and and agencies that's
a difficult for them to
do and so we really
kind of tied their hands in
response to that
additionally we talk
about the anti donation
clause and you mention some of the
concerns that that and
and you did you had and that
I I totally agree it
must be reforms
because a lot of the damage that was
done by the black fires actually
on
private.
jobs generates
11.5000000000
in wages
4.1000000000
and in taxes
and over
495000000
in exports.
Bring your attention to
another thing
that we've been working on
in.
The state is
the healthy soils program
program this was
started in 2019
with the pilot project and
in 2020
the yellow squares on the map
in front of you are local
governmental entities like soil
and water conservation
districts that
are implementing projects to
increase the health of our
soil to get
better coverage
better control
erosion and
take care of stuff like that
the greens of the circle show
we're non governmental parties
it manage lander
implementing projects for
with this we've
deployed stepped up
quite a bit of money in doing
that and that that's reflected
in the bottom table of
that.
Page.
Ongoing soil health
research funded through the New
Mexico department of
agriculture's healthy soils
program
is.
Creating an optimal mix
of cover crops and organic
amendments on croplands
we're doing research we're helping
fund research I can say
the department is doing itself
but we're helping fund
research in order
to control
erosion improve soil
quality and
conserve
water.
The best soil health practices
to guard against erosion
auctions weeds of course
in that noxious weeds brings
me to a point we've had a lot of
conversation previously
about the calf
Kaman canyon Hermance
speak the black fire that
recently and that's 1
of the things that we need to
focus on that's 1
of the things that we need to be
worried about with the soil
health research that we're
doing as these
fires come through and
devastate the landscape
it creates an opportunity
for noxious weeds to come
into play when
the rains come rather
than the native plants
we have poisonous
weeds that come up it
devastates the cattle
industry a good devastates
wildlife industry
and that's where the legacy
fund that was referenced
earlier as well starting
in July of
2024
part of that funding will be
used by the DIA department
of agriculture
to request
Knox's call
noxious weed specialist
and help figure out a way to
manage identify
find and work
with this in order to
sustain and maintain
agriculture in
the in the in the
state this will be done
in cooperation with the soil
and water conservation districts
and other entities throughout the
state to ensure that
we get back to where we're
supposed to be.
Back to
what's supposed to be on the ground
and that we're
not.
We're we're not facing huge
problem she's impacts
with agriculture in the
state in New Mexico
one of the things that
secretary what do
us that we bring in front of you
as part of this is is our
upcoming legislative
request I'll be brief on
that the department
itself has only one
recurring quest
reflected on this and it's
$130000
$7000
for what I feel
is I spent little
known to the to the
group and even my
employees I spent 21
years in the.
Information communication
technologies industry
and software
licensees was something
that I deal with
Microsoft is a beast
to deal with and they
hit us with the new bill
this summer that we're eating
out of the current budget and but we're
asking to be funded to recover
that recurring cost of
$137000
the rest of the recurring
money that we're asking for
goes to
to what we call
passed through for lack of a
better description but it goes to
the executive community
discipline
needs
the bounce for
signing contently exceeds
funding available
this is for for adjudication
and selling to settle in the
water
lawsuits in the
state.
And and value incentive
program to provide
money for we can partner
with federal and other entities
to do matching money to get
more. Objects
on the ground to help
it improve agriculture in the
state and then
we want to continue
to grow in premier our our
products if we have a
nonrecurring
request
for to support
marketing promotion and create
units that we can deployed
to to advertise
agriculture.
And with that I will pass
this on to
the next
presenter.
Yes.
Good morning madam chair members of
the committee thank you for
inviting us to talk to you
this morning
so I would act actually
liked ask for just a little
leniency for about 3
minutes to make a comment about
the our health
if that would be okay thank
you. So
I personally lived through the
dog have fire
it was half a mile
from our house
and I stood right next to
a lot of the supervisors
over over the firefighting
crews the comments
made to us during that time
was the underbrush is killing
us we can't
control this fire
because of the underbrush is
burning.
So control of the
underbrush has been
done naturally for
years and years by the
grazing rights of the
cattle.
So I strongly
encourage you to not
let those grazing rights go
away. I think
it's very very important to our
force I
support the logging
industry but
those Katelin those sheep that's
run in those forests for
centuries have really
control that
and I think it's very
important
the underbrush also
chokes out the new growth
of the trees
so just as a
thought to.
So thank you.
So what I'm here today
to present on is our meat
and poultry inspection program
our
we're still trying to
to stand this program up as
requested by the
legislators so
I'm gonna try not to read a
lot off of the slide you can
redeem yourselves but there are a
couple of things that are I think are
important that I would like to just
quote out here
so the federal meat
inspection and pro
federal meat inspection
act does give the
federal government federal
preemption over all meat
and poultry inspection across the
United States that
means that we have to meet their
requirements in order to have
a inspection
program.
The federal meat inspection
program are active
in the poultry products
inspection act gives
the FSIS which
is a unit under the
USDA the right
to work with state
in order for the states they have
their own meat and poultry
inspection programs.
So in order for us to have
those one of those programs you
must enter into a cooperative
agreement which is
called a state MPI
program and
in order to have an
agreement in place we
must be at least at least
equal to the federal inspection
requirements.
So this is one of the sentences
I would like to read
that at least equal
to standards require state
M. P. I. programs operate
in a manner that is not less
effective than those
standards adopted by the federal
inspection program.
So that's what we're striving
for and trying
to reinstate this
program across our
state.
So this next slide
is just a blur out of
the 2024
USDA budget summary
this is in their request
that the federal legislators
are now working on of course for
our national
budget.
So the state
meat and poultry inspection M.
P. I. programs are
an integral part of the
nation's food safety
system they help
prevent supply chain
bottlenecks within the
state ensuring
American families have plentiful
access to safe safe
meat and poultry
products.
So I would like to expand on
this this is a role
economic committee
so some of the economic
possibilities that this
program can bring about
for our state is
that our cattle producers
don't have to ship their
livestock out of state to be
fed out to be processed
lots of our cattle going
into the panhandle
which some of your very well aware
of that
money moves into Texas
those cattle are typically
process in Texas and
we bring that me back into
the state what this
program could do is open
up more processing
plants within the state
which gives the possibility
for ranchers to maybe
establish some feed yards
which the feed yards could
bring sales
prospects to the
farmers it also
creates jobs
not only does pen riders
veterinarians it
also there's welders
of course that need to
be on hired
to provide put stand up the
pans in the building's
construction companies
there is a vast
amount of economic development
that could come with this program
just by simply having
plants that can process
the livestock in the
state.
So the next
sentence here in the slide
does show that the
USDA FSIS
is committed to these
programs for
the 2024
budget there is a
request for
6.1000000
to cover the FSIS
contributions to the
program so
that once we enter into
a cooperative agreement up
to 50 percent of the
cost can be reimbursed
back to the state
but we have to be into that
agreement before that can
happen.
So Hey
if the program
grows and we can enter
into a C. I. S. program
which the C. I. S. program is a
little different than the MPI
program the C.
I. S. program allows
for
sales across state
lines the MPI
is for sales only within
the state so but
if you actually get into a C.
I. S. program
there you can be reimbursed up
to 60
percent.
So the next slide
in order in to enter
into a cooperative agreement
there is 9 components
that's required that we must
be at least equal
to.
The first and foremost
component is statutory
authority and food safety
regulations
we are in the process of
working with the governor's office
hopefully we will be able to
introduce our statutory
authority bill again
we are hoping that it does
go through this next time
so we have the bill we
went back through it we change just
a few minor parts in
it I am working
like I said with the governor's office
to get on the call for the
next session.
So the next one
is inspection
that will come there
are different types of inspections
summer on what we call custom
plants those are not
inspected daily those
are plants that
they processed meat for an
individual owner
and it goes back to that
household those
plants are inspected for pretty
much cleanliness the
other
type of inspection are for
retail sales
so an inspector must
stand in the plant from the
time the animal enters
into the plant
facilities to the
time it goes out and
packages
the inspector looks at
the animal anti
mortem and then
walks the animal through the
process all the way to post
mortem and
that is required for
retail sale inspector
looks at the live animal to make
sure there's no signs of the economy
and sick or
possibly injured that there
was antibiotics
possibly used on
all the way through the hanging
to make sure that the carcass looks
good in the process
and all of the cleanliness all
of the packaging is done correctly
as well as
labeling.
The third component is sampling
programs we have not worked
on this yet because there
are
some imho use and some
contracts that will have to be
entered into with
the environmental Department because
they currently inspect
for labeling
but we'll work on
those ones for closer to
expanding the program up
also will have to have
sampling that sent to
labs.
So the next one
is compliance
if you enter into a cooperative
agreement they come in and
they kind of audit how you're
going to operate your
program and then they come
back annually and they do an
audit so
it is very essential that
through this program and through
the each annual
period of operation that
all of your documents
and everything are
handled correctly and your
finances are ready for
audit.
The fifth one is humane
handling
that is really all spelled
out word by
word into CF are
from the office I
just we have adopted
rules to pretty much
just
we've adopted state
rules by reference
to the state of ours so
those are already in
place.
So staffing training and
supervision I I
on this one I would like to refer
back to the very last
slides in this
presentation
the words as where we are
now I'm very
proud to say that on August
18 the New Mexico
state personnel board approved
all of our positions for this
program the
it took us awhile to get these in
place but I have a ready to
go
it's the MPI director
the MPI deputy director
who will also serve as a training
officer in the enforcement
investigative analysis
officer.
I need to NPR
regional operations managers
to begin with I'm gonna
have of
what we call Ron
like in the northern part of the state
and one in the southern part of the
state and then we have
a meat and poultry inspector
to the meat and poultry
inspector one which is more of a
training position
so I'm proud to say those
are ready to go.
Of the seventh component
is laboratory methods and quality
assurance programs these
are again go back to M. O.
using contracts
with basic
state labs across the
state. The
civil rights that's all
handle of course through our state
personnel office that's pretty much
in place and then
the last one is financial
accountability
and
the Senate and the house
has been gracious enough to give
us reoccurring funding
so that one is secure at
this point we will be
going back to their budget
request for
more reoccurring
funding.
So the last last slide
and go over some of
this I've already touched on
but
again I want to reinforce
it under the authority
of 77
to 700
NMSA we
have adopted the rules
for these MPI program
and it is reference back to
the the federal
CFR.
The other thing is
The New Mexico livestock board
has submitted an official letter
of intent to initiate the
New Mexico MPI
program to the FSI
administrator
FS I have at this I
just has accepted the
letter. As
the in New Mexico in P. I. programs
formal application so
that is in place they're just
waiting on us for
statutory authority.
Thank
you.
Alright good morning madam chair members the
committee good to see you guys
again
okay.
We'll be
back.
Thank you madam chair.
So again try to stay executive
director New Mexico Chile Association
we are nonprofit organization
made up of
processors farmers
manufacturers really anybody
involved in the chilly industry
our membership ranges from
the state's largest processor
all the way down to farmers that
have a single row or
quarter of an acre so our membership
is very diverse across the
board. And
so if you go to the next slide I
just want to talk about some of
the historic chilly numbers
and and a graph that really
stands out to a lot of people that we
show it to and if you look
back to the 19 nineties
there's about 30 5000 acres
of Chile in New Mexico
fast forward to
2023 were covered
around that 80 500
acres so pretty
significant decrease in
the acreage of Chile
planted and harvested in the
state and while
you look at that and may be alarming
that doesn't tell the whole story
there's been a lot of research and development
over the years that have greatly
benefited
the chili industries to where we're seeing
a lot more higher production
despite the lower
acreage.
Going to the next slide looking at the chilly
numbers for 2022
lasted there is over 50 3000
acre Committee 50
3000 tons of Chile produced
in the state that was
a 4.5 percent increase
from 2021 so
positive trend over
from year to year primarily
our industry is
green Chile focused
we have over 40 9000
tons of Chile in New Mexico
green Chile and a little over
4000 tons of readily
in the state so we are primarily
green dominant.
And again when I talked earlier about the
significant do significant decrease
in acreage if you look at that next
line there's as far as going
to there's 13.8
tons per acre
so pretty significant
increase when it comes to
yield compared
to what we're seeing in the
nineties.
Total crop value is at
46.$2000000
41.8000000
of that was going to
drugs that we're on the
process side and
4.4000000 was
on the first sold as fresh
goods.
Going to the next slide looking at just some
of the issues and the
concerns that we're facing as
an industry of course
labor we're not
immune to the labor
issue and the state
in the country our
industry very labor
intensive it takes a
lot of folks to go on actually
pick the chili and
during COVID we seen a
significant decrease
in even the shortage that we had
prior to the pandemic
and talking to one farmer during
that time he was worried that he was going
to leave 50 percent
of his crop in the field because
he could not get it out
so pretty pretty
concerning pretty alarming as we
move out of the pandemic we're seeing
a little better
movie labor but still not
where we need to be as an
industry
the governor did fund
and the legislature subsequently
funded the chili labor
incentive program a couple years
ago and what we were very
appreciative and it was a good working
relationship with the state there
was some unintended
consequences of
that number
one are folks that apply
for that funding were subject to the
inspector public records act
and also the following year
the workers are see that supplemental
funding came back and said
if I don't receive that supplemental funding
I'm not going to work for you this
year and so the state
not funding that
farmers obviously we're not able
to supplement their
wages on their own so
we're and in some issues there
and and what we learned at the end
of it was the workers that we're
gonna come back anyway we're the
ones that came back and so
while it was intended to
attract new workers
it just essentially supplemented the wages
of those that we're gonna show up
anyway
so what that leads to is a lot of our
folks relying on migrant workers
primarily through the H. 2 A.
program that is a federal
program
and that works are big producers of
primary in the hatch Dona ana
and Luna County areas a
lot of those folks utilize that
program but as you move up
north where you're talking you know the 20
acres 30 acres of farmland
H. 2 ETS is not feasible by
time the factor in the
transportation cost to housing
costs associated with that
program so they to
a program we hear a
lot from the fed that that is a
solution it may
be. For larger productions but the smaller
producer and the mom and pop
farms it just doesn't work for
them they cannot afford it and so there
anymore difficulties of having to
rely on the American work
force as we all know that's it's really
difficult to get folks out picking
Shelly if you're
lying on the American work
force.
Listening to our water
shortage we're all face
in the drought including our farmers
are not immune to that
and so we're really looking at what
that Texas V. New Mexico
settlements going to look like and how that's
going to affect our folks on the
ground.
Increased costs of business
again one that was really
expedited during
the
pandemic when
some cases we seen fertilizers
quadruple in price
and so our farmers are faced with the
issue of what do we add to
put on the same out of fertilizer
just take the hit on the expenses
are do we not put it on
and face just what yield
loss we have that was
extremely difficult
for folks in
and a lot of got there but it was
a really hurt their pocketbook a lot of
folks actually lost money during the
pandemic because of that input
costs.
The next thing is just added
business that's put on by regulation
the healthy workplace Act was
extremely difficult for guys on
the ground implement
there's a lot of confusion on how to do that
even believer to 3 years
into that next folks still
having difficulty in managing that
for their workers and so
we're a little concerned with that
and and the increases in minimum
wage
that's being proposed in
in the past couple of days later sessions
are folks brought dollars
not that big their margins
are not that strong and so
when you continue to add expenses
businesses it really does
hurt the bottom dollar and as price
takers they can't just simply pass
that on to their consumers say
they just absorb that
and so it's it's extremely scary
for folks and and
scary enough for the president
more so ciation actually
got out of the chili Business because
he could just no longer afford
it I think over the past
5 years in discussions with them
he was doing it out of a
labor of love in a lot of passion
and and of course a passion
is not pay the bills and
so he did drop out of the
chili Business.
And I think that we've been dealing with a lot
lately is misbranding of
chili products there's a couple
lawsuits filed that in New
York for companies are
putting the New Mexico or hatch name
on their products and
selling it as New Mexico and hats
when it was actually source back
to either another state or out of
Mexico and so
we're really facing a lot of that is really
unfair business practice unfair
producers here in New Mexico
over really putting their love in
your talking generations
of work and and and
family
going into their products and when
you have a company just put the New Mexico
name on it's pretty disheartening for
us.
Going on to the next one kind of how
these industries in the association
is addressing those
so as far as labor and and and I want
to bring up we do have
an existing memorandum of
understanding with New Mexico State
University for
research
it's about $400000
legislative appropriation
every year that the association
are board of directors over
season and makes decisions
on what proposals are being
funded in cooperation with
NMSU there's been a
lot of good work that's come out of
that that address the number of issues
that are industry facing
and specifically the
development of New Mexico Odyssey
by Dr Stephanie Walker's
one that I'm gonna miss
you in the association for the hang
our hats on in New
Mexico this is the first Friday
that was developed for mechanized
harvest
and what essentially did is it
created a variety that makes the plant
more of a tree shape instead of a
bush 8 so allows
the machine actually go out and
and pick that up
pods right off the plant
itself and actually not
damage the plants so we're
we're very proud of that and we're extremely
grateful for the work that
the researchers New Mexico State
University is doing
and what comes a mechanized
harvest this is been something
that's been discussed for many years and
finally becoming a reality for
us readily we've been
always able to pick
mechanically but green is always
been the issue
and then there's been
hundreds of thousands of dollars
on engineers
to help develop a machine actually
what it took was a farmer that was
just kind of backed into a corner
we had one of our members who
again was facing labor shortages
and said I've got to do something
and he actually built and
perfected their
harvesting machine
to where you know
when you go through and you pick the chili with the
machine and you look back behind
where the machine is gone and the plant
is still there because in some
cases we're going to picking a
year and so the machine is able to
pick twice a year
on grants a pretty significant I
think it goes to just
the resilience of our membership in
our industry.
Water shortages
you know there's not much we can do about
getting more water we you know
if anyone has a solution to make
it rain more that would be
great
but what our guys are focusing on is
utilizing and making more efficient
use of the water that they're already
getting so we're seeing a
lot more drip irrigation being
put in a traditional
dirt it is being implemented
tur turned into concrete lined
it's is just try to utilize
some most water and get
the most efficiency out of water they
do get.
I'm increased cost of business then
again regulation is one that we
can't control we can just go
talk to you guys legislators
as policy makers
and hope that we can share our
stories and share the impacts on industry
policies that come down from Santa Fe
and even from DC
but on the ground with our guys are doing
is they're controlling what
they can and and that's looking at
more regenerative agricultural
practices to help minimize
the amount of inputs that are put into the
ground we're seeing a lot
more folks do more
of health folks on health social health
and I look at healthy soul
programs and other funding opportunities
to help that.
Sars misbranding
we do run the what's called the
New Mexico certified chili programs
you look at the spices that you got
yesterday there is a label on the
side and that's the
associations way of giving
for the consumers the confidence
that their chili products are from New
Mexico I was very
similar to the New Mexico true the grow
tradition it's more just a chilly
focused that falls
in line with the hat or the chili
advertising act
and there is audits behind that
so myself and
some our border directors actually gonna
do those audits and we can actually
source the product back to the
field that they came from
and so we feel pretty confident that
trademark and we want to give consumers
that confidence
the very last thing is we do have a good partnership
with NMDA we work with their staff
to do field verifications for
growers every year just to ensure
that they can get their loading
documents in a timely manner
and we're extremely grateful for the work that
secretary waiting his staff to it's
it's a great partnership one that we're
collaborating very well
together.
And with that Madam chairman of the committee
that is it I'll
be happy to answer any
questions.
Thank you so much and thank you all of
you for what you're doing
and and as I've referenced
before the the wheel of
a bicycle tire and we
look at how some of
the things that you've talked about are
also impacting like from
the previous panel and
and they all are kind
of intertwined in its
it's our goal and our mission and
I think our our purpose
is to try and be able to see all
of those things but also support those
of you who are addressing
each of those issues
I know representative Armstrong you
wanted to ask a couple of questions I
don't know if there's anybody else
who Representative
Duncan and I'll come with have got you
down I do want
to if I may
years ago when I was
working as a morning
news anchor and when the
mechanization of Chile
harvesting was a
big deal and it was kind of like
the sky is falling type
thing
because what we were looking at
was the
removal of
farmworkers
so the removal of jobs but
we're also looking at that balance
of what is cost effective
for some farmers where is
hand picking might be the more
practical approach
because of the quality of the project
and where mechanization was
at the time
and so I I'm
I I appreciate you
addressing that
and kudos to the
farmer who develop that because we
all like become
very creative out of necessity
sometimes and to be able to do
our jobs a little bit easier
so I'm I'm
really grateful for that
one of the things that I think
that you brought up in this is
more of a COVID is that we
have throughout this committee
heard about the cost of goods
and services going up
and we are just I
think at the beginning of this we
are going to continue to
hear of
different
industries
saying the cost of goods
and services are coming up we
are seeing it as
consumers
and even just with basic groceries
but I think it's really important
for us and it's a challenge for those
of you in the field of
conveying those things
like you know our restaurants are saying
that their prices have to go up because
the prices of their goods are going
up but it's hard for
us we feel uncomfortable about
talking about
that. In state
in as a business
our product our
special has to go up
because of these things
but I think we have to become
more comfortable with understanding
that not necessarily accepting
it but understanding
that that's what's happening
in our businesses in
our different industries as
at the cost of their goods and
services is going up and so
our challenge will be
how can we help them adjust
to that and keep them in
business
and so I I
appreciate that that is continuing
and please understand that when you
start talking about the cost of goods
and services sometimes
it feels like we are been saying
this so much that
we sound like we're complaining
but you're not.
We understand that we need
to continue to understand
how the cost of goods and services
for people who are providing a service
in the state are being
impacted and I think we need
to be sympathetic to that and
understanding and figure out
ways that we can help support
that but not as a
handout but as a support
and understanding that this is kind of the
nature and I I worry that
this is going to be kind of a trend that
we're going to experience for the next couple
of years at least at a
minimum. And
so for many of us who are in business
or in the business area we understand
that we're hearing that on a regular basis
so please do not stop
reminding us and
showing us how those costs
are impacting
you because
we need to we need to have that
on the forefront and
so
Representative Armstrong Emily go
first and then representative Duncan
and then Representative all
come. Thank you
madam chair and thank you all for
your presentation a
it always feels good to me
to have something presented
to me that I know a little bit
about I'm not
feel quite so
everything over my head
which is part of the
legislature right we all are
here to understanding get a
grasp on.
What happens in different
parts of the of
the whole the whole we all
as madam chair set
up plus the spokes
plus the hub.
And and figure out how that
all circulates and how it
all ends up on our table
madam chair I think a lot of
people.
I always like to say
I want to educate people
why I live where I
live and why I
do what I do I'm
a rancher first
and foremost I'm a rancher.
And I understand
the whole process
from a baby calf being
born protecting
it from the wolves that have
been re introduced
getting it to of
the. To be
raised to get
on the on the train
or the semi or whatever
to go be processed and raise
beef. But I
also have been highly
involved in trying to get this
meat inspection bill
passed.
And I have
constituents waiting.
Waiting in the wind.
For for it to be passed
so that they can vote of
a processing
plant so that
they can be USDA
certified
and and actually sell
beef I was told this morning of
the story where
in Arizona to USDA
certified plant looking for New
Mexico beef
so guess what they can process
it and sell it back
to New Mexico.
For the schools
and for the
food banks here in New
Mexico.
We could be doing that right here
all that money was state right here
all those jobs would be created right
here so I I just
want to push really hard
for New Mexico
people to be able to feed New
Mexicans.
And all that money staying right
here.
Part of the the
process that to
a. Miss
garland and others have been working
on is creating this
process and making it a
walk through which is not
the norm is not
the norm to be able
to say we have
this
entity and let
me walk you through the process
of how can
you become USDA
certified instead
of which is the majority
of the things in New Mexico
is all I gotcha let me provide
you. Gotcha
we caught you you're
doing something wrong let me find
you this is a
process that they want to
implement that is walk
through the process
people ultimately want
to do what's right they want to follow
the rules.
But when it government
and bureaucracy makes it
so difficult
to follow the rules there's nowhere to go
to say how do I do
this. It's
more of a gotcha well this entity
wants to walk you through the process
and I commend you for that
because of.
I've been in the gotcha
situations
before.
And and it's not fun and it's not
because we want to do wrong it's
because we didn't understand
the process so I commend
you for that I
I.
Love
what.
Mr parents put on
here.
On on how many acres
of farms and how many
billions of dollars and the cattle
country in the
rankings.
We need to remember
madam chair where our food comes
from and when people
get hungry enough
because the grocery store
can't bring in this
involves semi trucks
trains.
Fuel.
Employees.
Will need to really remember
the whole picture
remember the whole picture it's not
just about.
One thing
every single thing is
connected.
And as
far as my little
sawmill guys from catching
County
Luna.
You know and and thank you
miss garland for bringing up the
fact madam chair that
grazing shame on me for
not even thinking
about.
But the grazing on
this for slander it is
it's an important thing and guess what
those are some of my
cals.
They're helping but you know I'm
the bad guy have a private
ranch but I
also lease federal
land to run my cattle on
as well.
So I I know I'm on a soapbox
but I get really
angry.
When all we're trying all those
3 right there are
trying to do is keep
New Mexico good place make it
better.
And the panel before it the
same.
And it gets a little
exhaust.
Thank you.
Thank you Representative.
We constantly say about the
mud you know
and and I think
you know I bring that
back from my experience in non profits
and having a board of directors
that would make me feel
like I'm walking through mud
and you know as
my chairman Senator
Diamond Brantley is also
coming in in the same class
and. You know
Representative little coming in
a little bit later and you know
understanding that there's
a lot of mud.
In government
and
you know there's some that
it's it's
practical and maybe
effective and then there are other cases
where we're hearing that it's not
and I think
it's exhausting as it is
understanding that there's a group of
people it's not just one
person hopefully
to help remove that
I think is our goal
and so I appreciate that and
madam chair first I was remiss
and and and
congratulating Travis
in his newly
a beautiful wife Trinity
and and their their wedding
so congratulations on
your marriage.
Thank you representative Representative
Duncan and Representative all Cologne
and Representative Zamora
thank you madam
chair.
In some cases I don't think
it's much we're going through I
think we're up to
our oil wells
in mud we're not
moving it's
stuck.
And and that's my fear
is that we're gonna be stuck
we're gonna be here at
western 6
years now with
you 3 again and we're
still stuck we haven't
done what needs to be done and
so I applaud your
efforts I'm working with
a large way
do
rancher and he
is looking at
locating a
USA plant in New
Mexico and
8 it's it's choices
between Colorado
right across the border
for my
community.
And guess where he's
leaning.
We all know recently in
Colorado.
Because we can't get out of the
mud.
And that's unfortunate that's
jobs that will be
created in
Cortez Colorado
as a result
of
I'm gonna help you out.
Miss garland.
When I'm finished with everything I want to
do I'm gonna donate my time
to be a brand inspector to
you. I love my
counts I don't have
near the phone but I love
in and so I'm gonna
donate my time to how can I
send it to to do
that.
Would you would like to give me your
phone number and all
absolutely we
absolutely will
thank you for what you do and thank you
for pushing one of the
most important things
I love the and it's
this and everybody
else does too and so thank you
for for bringing
a critical role in
New Mexico and keeping that
at the forefront appreciate
that thank you.
Thank you Representative and I think
you know it's that is really
important for us to remember
where it comes from I mean I'm
still flashing back to that amazing
brisket gravy that we had last
night at the popcorn that I will
talk about forever the
thing that drives me nuts
is that we send money out of our state we've
heard these and other different panels about
how we export more food
and we have to bring in food
for the people who live in New
Mexico and you always
hear me talk about thank you local
first and it drives
me nuts and I remember this conversation
about a meat processing plant and
how are ranchers
and and meat processors have to go
to Texas in order to do
that. You
mentioned you were talking about it as I was
getting up some
snacks and it's it's so
frustrating that we
are we are just
letting money go out of our
state instead of
supporting industry so that we
can support level jobs keep money
here. I understand
the quality of the food that we're getting in
putting on our tables from
so I appreciate the
continuing conversation about
that Representative
Akan and then Representative
Zamora.
Thank you madam
chair. In
today's world if
you have a cow or calf
or and you want to get
slaughtered you can
take it to.
Somebody and
they will do this for you and
they will packages and
everything else
do these people
that process your
personal
we so to
speak.
Do do they get
inspected.
Madam chair
Representative Alcon yes
they are supposed to be
inspected those are what we
call refer to as our custom
plants and they
are to be inspected for
cleanliness they don't
the meat itself
does not have to be inspected
from beginning to end
because that goes back to a
personal household that's
supposed to be for that
person's house sold
in itself it's not supposed
to really go outside of that
but they are inspected for
cleanliness yes
I I can't say that
they are inspected
a lot in this state right
now because of the limitation
that FSIS house on their
number of inspectors.
So madam chair
of there for
I think my mic my
calf or the state
or get it
the
process.
The only thing that I can do
is use of myself I
could not sell it to anybody
else.
Madam chair representative al
cone that is correct
yes.
Thank you that's
interesting no.
The other thing I have you know
I I'm I'm on
the green chili a thing
you know I'm old
enough to wear
I remember by the secretary
for 10 Bucks
and paid like
even 2 or $3 to
get roasted
you know that's how old are
you.
And in today's
world that.
To get this whole thing
done at $50
a sack.
You know
the.
That long ago
we processed
for sex for
personal use
okay this
year. We're
processing for sex
for our personal
use.
Did the difference in
price need
anything to us
I don't think so because
a. Even
though we only paid 20
Bucks then number paying
50 Bucks or 13
Bucks then that we're only paying
that we're paying 50 Bucks
we're still
by the same
thing that we bought
at that lower price we
backed it.
So I
just don't wanna
thing to kill Division
of but it is of
kids when I was a kid
how used to get
paid but
looks day for bucking
hay.
And even that was
the best part of the day.
But. And
I and I think of how
intense and how hard
that labor is.
And when I think of the
somebody had to feel picking
chili.
In the hot sun
and I mean.
I mean I you know I remember
as a kid how hard it was to do
this kind of stuff
and they're getting paid minimum
wage.
It kind of makes me feel like
a our
world just turned
around and the you know
the guy that sit behind the
desk.
On the computer should be getting
paid minimum wage
and this guy picking silly should be
get paid $150000
a year
all.
That's how would
that work is so I
just.
I just got another step really
a how we can base somebody
for that kind of work minimum
wage
and I really get
and see how we can
complain about.
How we can sell our
product the New Mexico
because like I said
it didn't bother me this year
to pay 50 Bucks a
sack.
It when I got to buy
another 1 because we only got 3
done this year so far so as
to to get that open my wife
and again we do get to do it
anyway so
I just wanted to think about
that wouldn't it when you're looking
at this it's
it's hard work it's really
intense hard work
I just don't
see how we get
away with paying 750 I
mean whatever minimum wage is
now so with
that madam chair I leave it at that
thank you
madam chair if I could
if I could just clarify my answer
just a little bit
Representative Alcon
so if you
process your own
steer through
a custom plant that
meat is supposed to go back to your
household but if you have a
there are a few ranchers
out there that they
are set up in a business type
of environment and they
process their meat through a
plant that's inspected from the
beginning to the end
then they can retail that
meet it's all dependent
on that inspection if there's
an inspector in that plant
from beginning to end you
can retail the maybe if
it's coming out of a custom plant
you can not.
And thank you I thought I'd better
clarify that
so just to follow
up on that Madam chairman and
and I'll let you go okay.
Up so
therefore if I
intend to sell
the product that I'm going
to take
okay would to read a little more take
or.
I had to let that
the process
to know that it
needs to be inspected all the
way through.
And they will have an inspector there
to do it
Madam chair representative outcome
some custom plants
are not set up for that type
of inspection at all
you would have to find a plant
that actually has an
inspector standing in there every
day and that is
part of why we're trying to bring
this program back
FSIS is very
limited on their amount
of inspectors in the state
we sure inspectors with
Colorado
there's an inspector that comes in
direct tone he goes back
to Colorado so
there's only certain days of the
week that the private plant
in rat tone
can
processed meat for retail
sale so there's custom
plants out there
I believe maybe the one in for
some or is like that
they never have an inspector
come in there and stand from
beginning to end they only
do custom
slaughter.
So madam
chair so these Egolf
coming from Colorado's a
federal inspector
or
they work for.
Madam chair representative outcome
they work for FSIS their
federal employees
so our intent with this
program is to put more
inspectors out there which
enables more plants to
vote.
Thank you thank you madam chair.
Thank you I appreciate that and I
I will we'll
go representatives more in just a
second but I'm thinking of
we've had this idea about
for the wine industry and
bottle sanitation and
it is there a reason
that I'm sure it's probably
place closer to where the
demand is
of processing plants
or is it
realistic to think
of having
a large processing plant
like centrally located
in the state I'm
I'm just kind of curious
about that.
Madam chair I I don't
know that are
really.
I don't know if location is a
big factor I think it's
more people on open
plants I know
for example there is a
plant trying open fort
Sumner there's a gentleman
that wants to open a plant in we
already there is a
plan even in little town
of mountain air that house an
inspector in there a few days
a week there is
a huge big plan and
Rossell that is
in more the CIS
they they shipped their meat
across the state line
so I I think
it's all I don't know if it
really matters for location
I appreciate that
Representative
Zamora.
Thank you madam chair
and
presenters.
I don't know how many people in here
can have the history that I have
I was born on a farm
delivered by a
midwife.
And I've made my
living off
Ag my whole
life
it in the past couple
years I've sold my farm in
my range that I personally
accumulated
through a lot of years of hard
work.
Farming and ranching is a tough
business I've I've
seen. People
commit suicide.
I've seen people go
broke.
In far on farms
that were
generational.
That were paid for that through
the years and and somebody
else takes it over and.
And times can get so
hard of farming
that.
You can lose a farm or
a ranch and
it's it's a tough business
you deal with mother
nature.
You deal with prices of
commodities
fertilizer prices.
And we're the only
business and not
then these words
were taken
from I believe Pat
Woods.
Senator Pat Woods it
said we
by.
Retail and we sell
our product
wholesale.
And it's because of the farm
Act that was
created here in the United
States to
create
cheap inexpensive
food good quality
inexpensive food
for the people of this
country.
And it puts
stresses and
and.
On our business
to as farmers and
and Ag people.
We have seen an
environmentalist try
to push the.
The ranchers out
of places where they're doing
good.
And.
My personal
experiences
madam chair and and
the.
And.
Travis.
Is a.
In the in the in the I've been in
the fertilizer
Business.
That's one of the businesses I was in
it at a young age.
And.
I didn't understand it
till I bought my own
farm.
To the great degree that I understand
it today till I bought my own farm
and started buying the
product.
And then you always
wonder.
When the price of corn goes up a
little bit fertilizer
price goes up.
Even if the field in go
up or or some other costs that
it might a cop that might have
affected the mining of the
product or the or the
making of say you
re a.
And.
You look at the prices go
up and you always wondered are
the price gouging us
ordered.
Because they never give us
any room to
breathe.
We saw the prices
price of corn
go up this
year and what
did the price fertilizer
to.
It's skyrocketed and
in and I thought
man I'm glad I don't own my farm
this is it was
I'm glad I sold out.
But you see the farmers go through
those stresses and
and.
I don't think it's it at a state
level that we that
it needs to be looked at I think it's
more of federal
level.
But why do we get gallons
on prices like
that. It's
it's got to be a question we
we need to ask
our people in
Washington.
It's just
ridiculous.
That's more of a statement than a
question madam chair
over the years and and what
I've what I've seen in
faced
an.
White white
Travis this questions
for you quite
quietly.
As at in the big
picture do we not
see.
Labour's coming to harvest
chili we we
see that we have record
numbers.
Of immigrants coming
into this country.
They're coming in from all
over the world.
Not just Mexico anymore
it used to be Mexicans
out of Mexico would come in and
and they they were looking for
work and they were probably
hungry. And
their families are hungry and they were
they were striving to put food
on the
table.
In in the big picture of
it do you
feel.
Like the policy of
of this
country.
Has just do toward people
from stopping at that Chile
fielded pecan chili
do you feel like
we.
Have given
immigrants.
Money.
Free money just to come into
this country.
And. Be
able to live here without
having to work
to put food on the table
the is the is that a feeling that
you get so Madam
chair representative market yes and
and that's the feeling from of a
our membership as well
if you look at the typical people work
in the field you're talking 56
year old men and women doing it
that the younger generation is
not stepping up
I think that's a couple different
things first off I
think there's just a generational shift
in the work force to
where we're seeing you
know the millennials and and and
people more for you know my age
gap in age range
not wanting those physical jobs
they're wanting air
conditioned jobs are on technology
jobs and so
I do agree with and I think there's a number of
different things that play into
it what we're
hearing from folks is the workers that we
have the workers that we've had the last couple
years and we're not getting anyone you
even though with you're the high
movement from south of the
border coming in the United States we're not
seeing them in the field.
And and madam chair and and
Travis.
I think it's 90 percent
policy.
I don't think that the people are willing
to work I think they're
willing to work.
I I saw it in the potato
Business I've
seen it in in in the vegetable
business and around
Clovis
a.
Every quarter where where
people were willing to
work but now
days are not.
Because we
have made it in this country
so easy.
And and I worked for a guy and
and and I managed as
farm I had
the opportunity at the age
of.
Gonna say I was.
1819 years
old to manage
my first
for.
And it was because I grew up in
Farmington in farming
you don't you don't understand
and learn farming at a at a
college like this
you have to have your actual hands
in the dirt.
And you have to understand the
weather.
And you have to understand the seasons
and everything you have to
you have to have broad
knowledge of seeds
fertility balances
in the soil you have to
understand equipment you
have to be able work on the tractor
and you don't you don't get all that
in one day you
almost have to grow up in and that's
why we see these
generations.
Of farmers the keep
their farms and ranches in
the in in their
families.
But I was I would I would
I had the opportunity at a
young age.
To manage my first
farm.
And we see.
These things happen over the years
and and you just it
frustrates
you.
And it's maybe it's because we don't
have a bunch of farmers and
and in in the
legislature and the
state and
and sure enough not a not a bunch
of them in the in at the
national level.
But the policy
for farming to survive
has just gotten terrible
and and it's it's they've
done. The same
thing in farming as
we've done
with incentivizing
people to work is
the federal people have thrown money
at it. So
now we have
payments.
They go to ranchers
and farmers for
growing this crop for that
crop.
But it doesn't fix our
problems and
we're seeing the big problems in
labor in the in the
chilly industry.
It just. The
the just like you talked a little while
ago you we had money given
to us to help
put people in the field to pick
chilly but it hurt
us it wasn't the
right
policy.
And the.
I I think we need to get on our
federal delegation we have been
right Lujan sitting on the on
the ag.
Committee in in
DC I
think a lot of these issues
need to be brought
forth
I'm very proud
of the dairy industry in
in the eastern New
Mexico.
We have a big cheese factory over
there
it creates a lot of
jobs.
Brings in a lot of money into the
state.
We are importing milk
and and turning it into cheese
and eastern eastern New
Mexico
which helps the state a
lot. Very
proud of that we're we're facing a
lot of challenges with
with water
the price of commodities the
price of milk verses
the price of a the feed
that that the
cattle.
The need to be
fed. We're
seeing dairies go out of business
and in the eastern New Mexico left
and right.
They're selling out there
they're moving to Texas
to go live in Texas
what a
shame.
It's it's about policy
also I I hate
seeing that a
lot of good people there in eastern New
Mexico moving
out.
I I hope in the
future.
We can do better with the with our
policy in the state and at the
national level with with
farm policy that we
haven't seen good farm policy no
problem I'm interested to see
what this new farm bill brings
out. It'll
be interesting to get into that and
see
that.
Mr but at the
bottom
Anthony.
So so the ask
that you're doing and and maybe
Representative Armstrong can
help us with this madam
chair is that
directly to the
LFC are
you expecting
junior money in capital outlay
money for those ask
a.
What which
direction are we headed with that
madam chair madam
chair members that
ask is directly
we we as a state
agency said in kind of a
unique situation
where the only department
of agriculture in the state
or in the in the nation this
associated
with a
land grant university New
Mexico State University
so when it comes through our
budget we
go through the higher
education department
this request
is coordinated through the governor's
office and the higher
education department
directly.
So madam chair
and and maybe
Representative Armstrong can
is this budget being put into
H. B. 2 or.
This budget ask.
Madam chair
representative and
and and and the we
they'll requests through
NMSU because
they're housed under NMAA too
so it'll be a
request
in house bill 2
okay under the higher Education
NMSU
budget madam chair
members if I might add
just a point of clarification
our budget is a clean
line item under New
Mexico State University so
you have the Mexico State
University you have
the extension service
the experiment
stations and then New
Mexico department of agriculture's
and independent budget
under the board of
regents okay
thank you thank you for that
and thank you madam chair
and and that just
are the so those Asker
pretty much.
Well to it taking care of
as we speak madam chair
and and and
Representative Armstrong
madam chair and as soon as
they present their
budgets.
They'll ask for that and then
will you know as a
as a committee will go through it and
see if that's what is
recommended
from
LFC
but I can guarantee you
that myself and
the others that are on that
committee will do our best to
push for those
tasks and
and madam chair presenters
and and
Representative Armstrong
I learned that as a
rookie.
When I went in.
I I pushed
what everybody's familiar with
the weather station bill.
And we
we had a lot of support
behind us.
But the university never had
made the us the state
climatologist works through
the university for the
state of New Mexico
and.
One when I went up
to.
To Representative
lock Lundstrom.
To to get this put
together she
said no you can't do it this way you're
doing it backwards
and it so we
had we had to really
work hard to get it all put
together.
We did get it put together
after a few years a couple
years we
did get some federal assistance
from Martin
Heinrich and Ben ray Lujan
supported the program.
We're going to have one of the best
weather station programs in the
United States when this is done
and it's to support our ag
community.
Where they can receive their claims
from the are in may when
when they have a loss in the
on their forge programs
and I'm very happy
that I have
been
successful in that and
able to represent that
community in New Mexico doing
that
and
the those are all my
statements and questions madam
chair thank you thank you
presenters thank you
representative Representative Allison
who won Task.
Thank you madam chair my
first question is going to be
for Travis
and your second slide
your historic chilly
numbers you
have a reduction of
400 percent
over a period of 30
years how
much of that reduction do
you attribute to climate
change.
So madam chair representative
Allison and that certainly plays
into it I think
there's a number of different things
that we're moving we've
been in a significant drowned
that that place played into
and I think that
if I had to put a percentage to
it I'd probably say around 1520
percent.
Okay so you do believe in
climate change
I believe our climate is changing yes
Sir okay and
then the my second question
is for of
Mr Parker.
Most of my the farmers
in my district have a
problem with noxious
weeds.
We have made
several attempts
calling the New
Mexico state extension
office in Farmington.
They have promised to visit the
farmers
but 3 years
4 years later we
have not seen them what
steps do you suggest
next
to remedy
that knocks the Swedes
pandemic.
Thank you madam chair Madam
chair representative
Allison it
is a great question and that is
one of the things that we're going to
focus on heavily
with the legacy fund
we are currently
have a vacancy for a
noxious weed specialist for
the department of agriculture
and it's important to clarify
that the cooperative extension
service and the New Mexico department
of agriculture work
hand in hand are separate
entities managed
independently
I would suggest through
the through the
soil
healthy soils initiative that
we partner and create
some type of
project in that area to
focus on it the
opportunity is there
the funding is becoming
available in the near
future and we put that
program together
I will independently
send you information
so you can share with your
constituents for
our contact at the department
of agriculture the lady's
name is Julie Maitland she's
a division director over our
policy group and overseas
are are noxious
weed specialist and
in the future specialists
we're adding at least
2 because of our
concerns with the
wildfires and we
can start heading that direction
and collaborative Lee
we can get our partners
at at the extension
service in the experiment
station to help with that
as well.
Okay thanks for that thank you madam
chair.
Thank you so much he wanted
to go head to respond.
No I I if you madam
chair if you'd let me just make a
announcement that I
think would be of interest to this
panel
about a month ago our
state that Marian Mr
Ralph Simmons released
a dairy down in
the Roswell area from the
TV quarantine that
have been in place for 6
years.
So that was a
very large very
that I am very proud
that he and his team
worked extremely hard
to save he
worked with the banks he worked with
the the dairymen he
worked with the USDA
they tested they were testing
on a quarterly basis
but he did there and he did
remove them from quarantine about
a month ago and I'm very
very proud of that effort he put
into that that saved
a very large facility
that produces a lot of milk for the
state and employs a
lot of people.
Thank you so much thank
you. Well
thank thanks to the 3 of
you for being here today you are
our last presentation
of this particular committee
meeting here in Silvercity
and that means so thank
you all for your work and I know that
you know we've got some really great
cheerleaders on this committee for
you and we appreciate
what you do so to
go ahead and and stand we've got just
a little bit of business to take care
of that will get quickly
we do not have any public
comment and
so at this point
well I promise that we would do
like a really quick summary
of legislation
that we are going to be considering
for endorsing and just to give
you a timeline
what will happen is is that we
have 3 bits of
legislation
the final draft will be sent
to Erin by October 6
Martin will work on that.
And he's if
he's already confirm that to over
6 is a reasonable
date for that and
then Aaron will send
that to the committee on
October 9 via email
but also the on the first
day of our meeting
inTaos
you will have a separate folder
beside the the information
that you have for your per diem
and the the pandemic
you have a separate folder of
the legislation on the first
day so that you can go over
that before we actually
vote on that on our very last
day in Santa Fe so
that's that's kind of the run a show
on that one. And
so at this point I'm
just to give a little bit of a preview
I don't know if representative Duncan
and Representative Zamora ready to
talk you're welcome to start first
if you'd like and then Senator
Diamond Brantley and
then I don't have to go up to the
table you can just go from your committee
chair there
so you have to be that
formal let's talk
talk amongst ourselves all
right thank you madam chair I
would like to ask for Representative
Allison instead of Representative
more colleges you keep
learning and I'm so sorry yes
representative
Allison.
Now and this is really talking
about the importance
of rail lines
on the Navajo Nation for the to
make people so I appreciate
that Representative
Allison.
Okay of.
We have been talking about this
realligned for a number of
years
and it would
really benefit our area
because of loss
economic opportunity
that my colleague
mention of the
lost of power plants
and.
Hi support this realligned
because it would bring economic
opportunity not
only will it
of import and
export services
in addition to that I see
it as an employment
opportunity because
when I was working at the Navajo
money we had a real
we systems that
transported coal
from like 5
or 6 miles away
so we have
Navajo people that
were mechanics on the
diesel engine locomotives
and then when we converted
of some
abandon
electric locomotives I
was part of the transformation
we reduce the speed and
just the really
tone them down to only run
at like
40 miles an hour
Max rhetoric a major
reduction from 200
miles an hour anyway we
did that and we have
people with expertise to
do that and then there's
also going to be real
maintenance my
people the Navajo people
are very good at
of maintaining the
tracks and they are just
meticulous and all
that they do so I
look at it as an economic
opportunity in that manner
as well it's going to produce
jobs and then
1 of my legislation
earlier was to
promote the uranium
mine cleanup detailing
cleanups we're gonna
need major
equipment
and some of those I
understand can't be transported
over the highways
and that railroad
if we had a system to transport
it that would really assist
us as well so
of we would be asking
our colleagues to sepsis
help us support a real
way into the 4
corners my
preference would be
to run alongside the
371
instead of following the
P. G. and E. lines
which I heard was another
proposal so
I would support the 1 going
along highway
371.
Madam chair
the metropolitan
district can in San Juan
County that's one of the largest
districts in the nation that does not
have rail or
interstate it is the
only district in the state
of New Mexico that has neither one of
those and so we're
asking the this
this committee to
ask our deal with the federal
delegation to put us
down and
this is a it's about
a $20000000000
opportunity
for transport
Economic Development
employment the
Navajo Nation is the
largest
is the largest employer
of the 4
corners power plant
and they were 60 percent
San Juan this went down with the money
as well so
there's opportunities for
lots and lots of business to grow
there and so we increase
this committee to.
To help us for this
legislation or in this
case I think it's just going to be a
memorial I
think resolution chair
at how's it going
how's it been Frank Martin.
Memorial okay.
More yes Sir the Joint
Memorial yes okay
you know and I think it was really important was
when we saw that image the
visual the the the
slide that was presented
that showed no
development
whatsoever
and we can talk about
the reasons behind that
and all sorts of
things but I think
it's like I think there's an agreement
that we're long overdue
on that and and we need to move
forward that so thank you
representative Allison thank you
representative Duncan and also thank
you to Representative Montoya
because he was the one who brought this up
and really
was able to to have those voices
at the table as well so I'm really
grateful that we're able to discuss
that here
so thank you very much for
that Senator Diamond
Brantley do you want to go ahead and go over
here.
Thank thank you madam chair
following up on that
conversation I think that was a Santa
Theresa conversation
I also wanted to propose to this
committee
it was it was Senator
SI Hemphill and representative
of Taurasi's who are initially
approached I believe for
short line railroad
expansions because of the mines
in this area the Jennifer
Jones and I down on on the border
region for and and
not just be 2 to
one Martin has a copy
of
is what it does is it just provides
a tax credit up
to 50 percent up to
$1000000 per company
with a maximum of a
$6000000 tax different
we're just giving and they have to
it's we're between but they have to
put the infrastructure in first
and then we'll make reimbursement
really what it did is it it
aligns
really our tax policy
it's it's
nationwide it kind of brings it up to
date with a lot of of
other other states and so all
that's doing is incentivizing are
smaller.
Class to class 3 roads here
in New Mexico so that would
connect to BNSF and
union Pacific which were very
supportive of it as well a
tax and and I don't know
the details of of what that needs
to look like but I will I
wish Senator Shendo was
here it's my understanding that when
those tax bills got rolled
into that the
Senate tax committee that
it was they were judging a ranking
it came in just shy of the
top 5 that seem to go in
and as we know the tax package
kind of went awry from there
didn't seem to have any opposition but
just can't seem to get done to
get past the the the finish
line on that I was also
taking pretty close notes and
communicating with Martin
after Deming meeting
I would propose again
$1000000 for one
time funding for
the wine restoration Fund
we had the presentation that was
certainly money well spent if you
remember in the
presentation
a $1000000 investment
has a return within 3
years and just G. R. T.
we're getting 2000000 back
that money was very well spent it
was put in the ground and
the tribes have now come
in saying we too would be interested
in that program has a long
list of justice tribal
lands who also want to expand
our great garter
vineyard production what
that provides just
rootstock to expand
vineyards is what
that one and then the last
one that I wanted to talk about was also
brought up during
that that same meeting in which
we had the
the prostart a
presentation was brought to us and
so I would propose the
$500000 from the
general fund to the tourism
department
we cannot specifically state
for prostart but we
could we could
the language in there could say for
recurring grant expenditures
for hospitality career
high school program
that supports the industry and
supports instructors in the high
school of culinary
and restaurant persons
and so those would just be
up you know proposed
appropriations that that I would like
to see move forward on this committee
that's fantastic and
so those be 3 different
okay so we'll have just a little
bit on our flight left I
think which is from.
Tastic thank
you very much for that I appreciate
that lastly
minus the catastrophic Business
relief program we heard about
this in Los crucis
and it was the the the history
of that was that we had a local brewery
that experienced a fire last
March
and
they need access to
quick money
and and to to
help if anything to pay their
premium or to help
at least trying to keep their employees
covered up for a little
while while they were getting insurance
coverage and all sorts of stuff and
so it
was really that demonstrating that
each businesses really one cat
catastrophe away from from
being threatened to to shut
down and
businesses need access to quick
money and so this does fall
under Lida
and so we're not violating the anti
donation this
covers unexpected events
not maintenance
in Los crucis we've had
over 20 businesses
apply
but several of them were like well my burger
was going out on my my
stove and so I want
that doesn't that's not a cat and
that's not a catastrophe a catastrophe
is something that is unexpected
that is harming and
I'll give you the definition when we
talk about it Santa Fe you'll have
that information for you
but but it's really something that
is a catastrophe an
unexpected event
and so what happened in our
particular case is
that we have a lot of 5 to
$10000 Max per
business.
But understanding that already
since July 6 businesses
have benefited from this and really
what was happening is during the the
hot parts of the summer there H.
fax systems were shutting down
and those are catastrophic events
because if you don't have
during 106 degree
temperatures have a building
that's cool you're not gonna be able to
have people in your in your place of
business and
so we'll have more
information is this comes before
the legislature the
city economic development department
is keeping very tight
information on the
different types of businesses
that are applying but
you know when we say as
a state we want to be friendly to
small businesses
you know as we found that many
of our small businesses have no
idea what programs are
available.
Much less the capacity to
apply for those programs
so not only does this
provide them
immediate within
2 to 3 days because in our
case what happens is the city of Los
crucis went
before the city council
and asked for an approval
of the entire appropriation which
typically they have to
do that for every single
application
that's the mud
that we're talking about
and so what they did was they were
like we're going to ask for the
approval of the $50000
that I dedicated is junior
money to start this
program. I
see that this is something that can help
businesses all over the state
the challenge that we will have to
explore is
how can smaller rural
communities that don't have an economic
development department that issues
lead to funding.
How can the access that money so that's
going to be the challenge that I'm gonna find
and that will work with the EDD
on because
there might be regional the small business
development center I don't think can
do that.
But what we'll explore that because
we want to make sure that it is
available and
for me personally a priority
for our rural communities as
well just because
it seems that the the
axis opportunities
are are a little bit more limited
but in addition to this it also
provides businesses with the
department that can help them on other
bills and on other on other
funding sources
because often they don't
know they don't have the time to
but if they are driven
to reach out
to an economic development office
because of a catastrophe
and maybe they've got something
else that can be covered by other
funding in the state
and since I feel that we are
doing not the best job
at letting businesses know what is
available to them this is
really an entrance into
that so it's kind of like
you got the catastrophe but let's
share with you other things that
are available to you to
help you thrive so
I I feel that this is kind of 2
fold is helping businesses out
in our unexpected
event but also introducing
them to the other
opportunities that we provided
the state to help them
thrive in case they have
emergencies and and that
and that case
so I'll get
definitions of catastrophe to
you and with the
one thing that Martin are going to talk about
is like how do we
find those areas that don't
have somebody that can issue lead
to funding how do they get
access to that so those are the 2
things that I want to make sure that we
provide to make sure that
happens.
Madam is
is that as we open
up that so
the guy has a fire.
And then the sprinklers come
on as a flood
just go in this case
the guy will these down so to speak
directly and so
will that be a one stop shop
that as we we tell
them okay this is this is a
list of A. list available
okay thank you.
Yes Representative I thank you madam
chair I just wanted
to to remind
you of the cat catastrophe
that we had in in Magdalena
where the business
owner I knew fairly new business
owner became
severely ill
and so just
keep that in mind when I to
define your catastrophe
and then I also just wanted to mention
that I would like
to
have the committee's
endorsement on the meat
inspection
bill as well it's
changed a little bit there trying
to untangle some of the
messiness that were
brought. Brought
some
some.
Pause to some people
and so I would
like to mention that I
I sounds like I did
get a text from Kendall
Chavis while I was
sitting here and she says
this will be it will
she didn't say it will be on the call but she
indicated that
maybe it can pass this year
so to me that indicates that it
might be on the call thank
you madam
chair.
It died in Senate
Judiciary just
not because
of a lack
of getting there it sat
in there for a month point 5
thank you madam
chair.
So I'm I'm suspecting
that you and I both received a Texan
candles I'm suspecting that she is
watching this committee right now
so hi
Kendall.
So the thing is is so
if we can get a copy
of that bill
that would be great and that's already
drafted so
I'm thinking of just dumping a
bunch of things on Martin's play
and I want to do that
I'll get you a copy madam chair okay
if you get that Martin and
then we'll go through so that
will have a series of
that so we'll plan for about an
hour on our
last day to have
these discussions and I will try and
set up like
if if I can ask of
the committee to please review
that so that our questions
are really straight into the point
and we can really plow through that and get
be very efficient
that would be fantastic
I'm excited about that about
that there's a several bits of
legislation that that that we want
to try and and look at and see if we
can endorse and I move through so
thank you very much
so at this point of
I think we are done in this or any
other questions or
comments.
