All righty good
morning everybody this
my name is Carrie Hamblen and I'm serving
as the chair of the economic and rural
development policy
committee we are
here in Sunland park at doing
in a community college
for the first of 3 days in
southern New Mexico
we do not have
a quorum will operate as a
subcommittee but once we reach
a quorum we
will at some point in
the next 2 or 3 days
votes to approve the
last 2 meetings minutes
K. we know that there are some people
some of you experienced
the lovely construction in
Texas
and strongly recommends
taking Donovan to get back
home if you need
to go back up north but we
have a quite a bit on
our agenda the
next couple of days and I'm really
grateful
that we are here today
our meeting today will consist
about hearing about short line railroads
in the rail system and
driving through our state you know we may look
off into the distance
and see a line of real core
cars transporting goods
and services to us throughout
our region sometimes
I often think of when I see our our
our trails are are short
line railroads and looking at the
base of the mountain and seen
these long line
of of trail cars what we may not
realize is the origin
of that particular trade and how it
helps our state and we'll see a lot
of examples of that
today and I'm
very excited about what we're going to be
learning and then tomorrow and
Wednesday will be at the Burrell College
in our topics will be the metropolitan
redevelopment act
helping small businesses
film public banking
nonprofits a whole bunch
of good stuff and then we'll finish
off with public comment on
each of those days if we have
any before we recess and
for those of us who are watching on the webcast
thank you so much appreciate you
tuning in
as committee members I do
like to remind just a couple of
requests that I have for
you that remember that people who are
presenting to our committee are here at
our request and
many are giving up their day and
sometimes pay invaluable
time away from work to come and talk
to us so I would like us
to be respectful of their time
I do ask that you keep your questions
to the topic at hand if you have
any for. Follow up questions Aaron is
really good about
reaching out to those speakers
and getting the answers for
you from that
and then I'll do out my best to keep
us on track and on time if it
looks like it discussions going off subject
will certainly bring us back
but most importantly I do appreciate
all of you being here today I
know that we had a little bit of a construction
of maze to go through
to get down here and I'm
grateful for your commitment to being
here to the committee.
Okay I do
want to have a this disclaimer
this is this is kind of a unique
situation but we know in New Mexico
it's always 2 degrees of separation
in some way or another that
were either related or we work with
people of many of the
presenters during our time here in
southern New Mexico are
professionals that I and Representative
guy a goes have the honor of working
with because of our jobs
and in most cases these in
in my case most of them
are also members of the Los crucis being
chamber of commerce of which I am the CEO
and president their
membership is had no influence on the
presentations today and also
as we do everything we can
to maintain committee protocols
and decorum I also
recognize that there may be times
that because of these relationships
our presenters may not go through the
chair or call me madam chair
because they know me is simply
just Kerry.
And I'm not going to fault them for and I'm not
going to correct them so I hope you
understand this is kind of a unique
situation that
many of us I have worked
together in a and a variety of
ways but it's a it's
an honor I think for
the both of us to have
such incredible people who
are doing great work down in southern
New Mexico because
we're often ignored sort
south of Sapporo
and we get kind of a
little a little crappy when that
happens and so
in those of you who know me know I probably
would have used a different word
but we do get a little
crappy when we get ignored but there are some
incredible things happening in southern
New Mexico and
and I'm really really
grateful for those of you who come here
today so that you can see
because all of us especially those of
us who are in rural parts of the
state no that
our communities are doing great things
and we need to highlight those
because it's not just the big cities
of Albuquerque Santa Fe Los
crucis my right
because we've we've got some stuff going
on so
today we're gonna go ahead and get into
the nitty gritty of it I
would like to welcome Dr Monica what
is who is the president of done in a
community college
thank you doctor put the onus for
letting us use your facility today
we've had a couple of things
I'm having the same thing because
I know Dr Torrez on a personal level
in the fact that I have to call the president or
Dr Torrez is always something
that we can go about when
we're out in public so
drive but it's thank you so much for
being here today and thank you for
letting us use your facility
we're very
grateful.
Thank you madam chair
that little
bit.
Thank you madam madam
chair.
Madam chair members of the committee I'm
so happy that you are in southern New
Mexico and that you're at our someone
part campus
might my job today is talk to
a little bit about Dona ana community
college and what we
do if that you should
have a handout that
is the
basically slides
I I'd like to talk about 3 things today
I'd like to talk about what our commitment
to our communities are
we often say commitment to community
but Willie we know that we serve
multiple communities
and in the last few years
we've we've made a very specific
commitment to them that I'll talk about
and also like to provide a little
bit of a college update
talking about some of our facilities
our programs our students
and I want to talk about this the
opportunities that we're seeing in the
southern part of the county
just specifically the someone parks
on that that this
area.
You know a lot of times colleges
I was at a meeting
a few years ago with legislators
and higher ed person
said well this will help our
enrollment 1 of the 1 of the
representative said I don't
really care about your role that I care
about community members who
have access to
opportunities and
and I heard that and and I thought
well of course I know my
colleagues we care about our
community members but we don't always talk
like that so so in the
last couple years I've really asked us
to start thinking in those
terms and so I asked us
to make a commitment at the college to
ensure that people in the communities
we serve not only can
access opportunities
but actually can benefit from
them you know a lot of times
higher it's been known to that we
care about enrollment
but in the last 45
years we've had to be
very intentional that not
just caring about enrollment to carry about
completion caring about
graduation making sure
that people don't leave
our institutions with
lots of credits and
lots of debt right and and so
that's our commitment to to the communities
we serve in in Dona ana
county of the way
that we try to operationalize that
is we've actually sent
out for very specific
priorities that
that have gone in in the strategic
enrollment management plans that that
we submit to LED at
HPD and and
LFC and
and we're finding things that matter
these are the things that matter
to to us it at
the ACC first 1
is access how do
we simply increase
the numbers of people who
access our services
and resources.
A lot of people would say well that's just
enrollment and that's
a promise if you're talking
institutionally these
right but but more importantly
it's about the human beings in our
communities how do we help them
access resources
that we know can make a difference in their
lives the second
priority is really how do we increase
the number of people who are using the
resources at the
college and in the
community that we
know make a difference for
success we
know that if they if
they access these resources and
use them they will they
the numbers show that that
they're more successful the third
one is is completion often
we talk about completion
in higher ed we're talking about
graduation rates or credentials
and those are those are important those if that's
what I'm gonna report on today
but one of the things that we're trying to
figure out also is something some
students don't come to us for a degree
or certificate they come to
us for a very specific set of
skills they come to us
to learn something we
don't know yet and higher at
how to track that we just
don't right into that so
well I'll I'll give you
graduation to get the number of credentials
that we produce one of the things we're
also working on this is how do
we capture as
successful those students who come
to us for one or 2 things
right set of skills
and industry recognized credential
something how do we capture that because we
don't yet know how to do that
and the last thing is efficiency
one of the things we know is
that as a bureaucratic
organization we can put
barriers in front of
students right and and and
and they're kind of journey on their
journey to success so one of
the things were also asking ourselves
is is
how do we clean up our
operations how do we
restructure our operations to
really support what they're
doing.
I mean it I mean it I'd like to go
then to to the college
update and and
I'm on slide page 3
but slide
6
and and this is yes
6 facility 6 locations
and doing and County 3
Los crucis to major
campuses there there are to be
there are 2 campuses in their and their
sizable they they serve
several 0 students each
and then we have a small
at the workforce center
in Los crucis an educational center
and then in in southern Dona ana
county we have a location
at chaparral
Anthony just off I. 10 you
probably order and and
someone park and and there
you can see kind of where they're
located on the maps
when I talk about DCC
programs
there's a there's a variety of ways to
think about what we actually
do most of the time
people think about credit credit
to programs
it's all talk about those first in
your packet you also have this
handout.
And this basically
Liss
all of the associate
degrees that the ACC offers
on the left and all
of the certificates we offer on
the right and what you'll
see is you'll see a couple of a couple
of signals of
signs symbols
rather one of them is
like a little wifi symbol and
that means that that's offered
online and
then in NMAA you symbol and
that means that that's a
program that is designed
to link a student from the
ACC to the
university.
So we have 44 associate degrees
and 76 certificates that
we offer at the college
of those associate
degrees 10 of them
are transfer explicitly
transfer programs to the
university and those are
set up to be essentially 2
plus 2 so students can do the first
2 the first 2
years at at the college and then
the last 2 in New Mexico state
and the curricular are linked pretty
tightly so students are going to lose
a lot of credits when they go from one to the
other and
then the other
34 associate degrees are
all applied associate degrees to
put students into the workforce after
2 year degree
in addition to that there are 76
certificates some of
those certificates are less
than one year some
of those certificates are one year
to 2 years and then just
student would get an associate degree
all of those our work force
our our focus on getting students
into the
workforce.
I will talk just a little bit about
face to face and hybrid
almost every
program now
offers some classes
online right
the everybody had to gear to that'll
show you a graphic in just a
little bit everybody had to do
some of that during the pandemic
so that as much as possible
during the pandemic went
online we
did right so even
if you were in building construction
technology if there's a
particular set of information that could go
online we did it online
we reserves any face to face
time on campus during the pandemic
for those classes that simply could
not be taught online
some things you just have to do
in person welding
certain sorts of chemistry
testing for water
technology a certain
court sorts of demonstrations
for culinary or for for
H. back so so
every program has some classes that
they teach online
we but as I noted
we have a number of programs that are
fully online that
you can you can get the entire
degree but by going
online I will say
one thing that's changed
is that during the pandemic we
obviously shifted over
to as much as possible
online this is the
first semester where we're
feeling a real difference
on campus.
Up people are telling me of visors
and federally or state for whatever
reason they feel like the fog
has lifted and students
are saying wait wait can I get
that face to face can I
be on campus there is a different
energy on can't we've been we've
been back since July of
2022 we've
we've we've done a lot of stuff on
campus and had most of our staff
that since July
twenty twenty two this is the first time
where there seems to be an energy
around being being face to
face.
If we take a look at the non credit
options and and for us the non
credit options are I mean
we often think about
colleges credit but
one of the I think tremendous
opportunities that a
community college offers lots
of non credit opportunities for
people to get training so we
do what we do a lot of workforce
training I'll talk a little bit more
about that when I talk about what's happening
at someone some of
that is customized training
for of
businesses if a business as
I you know I need customer
service training can you do this I
need forklift training can you do
this we will we will work
with the business to get that done
and some of it is independent classes
that that students we we offer
noncredit of that tech
class for example so
that that is a sponsored by a business
but we know there's some need and and
students want want to do
that and those are all non
credit of course we have a
an adult at a
significant adult and population
across the county a big one
here for sure
so high school equivalency in
ESL classes
article that program also does
something and has really
gotten something that's a national
movement so you will have heard of it from your
community colleges in your
counties and
that is what's called I. E.
tier integrated education
training a student
shouldn't have to wait until they
finish their GED
to get some workforce training the
students shouldn't have to wait
until they're they're what
we call fully fluent
in English to get
workforce training and so we're seeing are
dealt at populations are adult
and employees
work with 12 employees to
try to to try to maximize
those I know one of the
areas that we've done that in is in building
construction tech
technology.
And then one of the one of the
things that we
offer in
the county we have
our main office in Los
crucis but we we very
proudly have an office here that's our small
business development center
and I was talking to representative Armstrong I know
she was really supportive of
action Representative
Madrid Representative
Lara
Representative small
super supportive of
putting an an SBDC
office in Dona ana
county obviously
with with the assistance of
of Russell
and plan
we knew that there was a we knew that there
was business here that needed to be
done and so I
and so we have a have an
office.
Go to page 5
slide 9 and talk a little bit
about the ACC enrollment
as most of you know because this is been
up in conversations a lot
in the legislature the last number of
years is that almost
all institutions of higher
education than losing in Roman
for about 10 years we're
going to see about 6 years of
TACC enrollment here and you can
kind of see the end of that
20182019
you can see that that
and I'm gonna use the number the top just
because it's easier to see that's fall
enrollment so you can
see the I can tell you there was
lost before that if you could see
the years before that you would see
the some loss
you can see that it's it's about
flat in 2018
follow 2018 info
2019 we were actually
up 3 percent
and that was the first time that we've
been kind of up that
much in if in a few
years price for I
but then what you see what happens in the
pandemic DCC lost
20 percent enrollment
during the pandemic
that's just the this is the
heart of opportunity lost
for members of our community
just a ton of
opportunity lost and you
can see 13 percent 1 year
and 7 right that the
following year 2021
in in 2223
we saw an increase in enrollment
of course some of that that there
there 2 reasons I I believe is
that people work we were coming out of
pandemic but as you know
the opportunity scholarship
made a huge difference
for Dona ana county
residents for sure coming to
school you know 1
of the things we talk about a lot of the
lottery scholarship 1 of the differences
is the opportunity scholarship just
the elements of those.
That the elements of that scholarship
really was some of those were
built for community college students
the circumstances of of our
students so for example
in the very first ball the
opportunity the second follow the
opportunity scholarship last are
financially director tell me the
numbers we had about
200 students who were
benefiting from the lottery
scholarship we had
somewhere in the neighborhood of 2000
students who are benefiting from the
opportunity scholarship
and part of that is just the
different circumstances
that that are that are built around
the scholarships and
then in the orange the orange people
there that's what we're projecting
what that's what projecting for this
year we're projecting another 3
to 44.5 percent
increase this year
for me that with 20
percent loss I would've expected
to see enrollment to recover
more quickly that's just so much
loss but
I think I think we pry have a few more
years we're gonna see 3 to 4
percent and
and I
think 1 of the things that may be
different to is as we know
people developed a lot
of the recognized other
priorities in their lives beside
school young people
did older folks
that and so that may be why
the recovery is a little bit more modest
than than I anticipated
appeared right next to it that's really
national information that shows
you if you go all the way to the right
that's the community college
secretary and you can see
everything's below flat
rate for the last 4 years
everything is below flat I
mean it was just kind of
recognizes the tremendous
loss of enrollment nationally
community colleges but you
can see that last year which is
spring of 2023
there was a little bit of gain and I
think we'll continue to see gate in the
in the community college sector
over the next period in the next
few years at least for
sure.
I wanted to just chat briefly
about one of the other changes that we
saw as a result of the pandemic
if you take a look at slide 11
on page 6 you'll
see the those blue lines
in the that blue line is
basically
mostly face to face
classes.
There the including clinicals
for example health clinical
you can see that prior to the
pandemic we taught
80 percent of our classes
were were most were face
to face right and you could see that
would we're pretty consistent
2022 percent
online and then you
see with the pandemic us right
you can just see that radical
shift to online
instruction during the pandemic
almost every community college at some
face to face because begin
because we teach career technical
education we absolutely
have to have some
some face to face instruction
and and then you can see that as
we were moving out of the pandemic
we there is
there is some growth back towards
face to face
there couple things I don't think right
now we're at about 50.4
percent of our enrollment is
is online
still I think it'll even
out a little bit more I I think
I don't think it's going to stay
major online I think
we'll see more face to face and if
it and if I'm hearing our by our
faculty right now right I
think they are telling me
that there is they that people
are starting to think about
being in a in a in
person face to face to face
environment I think that'll change
was still we have 54 percent
of armament is is still
online.
If you take a look this
is spring 2023
enrollment and
DC server somewhere in the neighborhood
of about 50 500
students in the
springs were over
I think we're close to 7000
in falls were between 65
and 7000 each fall
and that's that's head
count
it's so if you take a look at
what is our enrollment look like
if the first the first
slide which is slide 12
really shows you the female male
brink Brigham this is been
changing over the last I
would say 10 to 20 years
where you years we're seeing fewer
males and it that
females occupying a greater percentage
of our student bodies
I read an article in the
spring and the chronicle of
higher education that suggested
that it wasn't necessarily there were fewer
men in college.
There are more women in
college so so
it the the males in college
make continue that number
may be relatively static I
have not done that study for DAC see
this was a national
publication about what we're
seeing is lots more women
coming coming to school.
If you take a look at the next
page you will see
how our students are coming to school full
time and part relative to whether
they're full time part time
we have the slides right yes I
do slide 13
of full time part time
it's interesting
so.
Recently I have a new relationship
with NMSU grants in an agency
to NMSA
on Bordeaux it's
interesting how what
they're chart looks like
entirely different
so requests
has way more part
time students and full time
students Alamogordo
has way more full
time students and part time
students and DCC
just with the difference this is the
about half of our students are full time and
half of our students are part
time I can't explain
I'm sure that if we wanted to if we want to
do some analysis of the communities
that there and we would discover pretty
quickly what those differences
are of the DCC
is about half half and
half if you take a
look at the chart on the right
slide 14 that's
really of a race ethnicity
demographic what what are
demographics or lookalike
and clearly the huge percentage
of our students are Hispanic right
73 percent
and then 18 percent
our European American or
or white students and
then we have very small percentages
of of American
Indian Asian
and African American students
I know that one of the things that the
NMSU provost is interested
in he's he's really started to
think about wait wait how do we
support our American Indian
students in the state of New Mexico more
fully the New Mexico state has in the
past and we will we
will be at the community college
in the same city as New Mexico state we
will be part of part of that
conversation.
If you take a look on
slide
15
no one of the things we talk about
career technical education what
there's a lot of conversation in the
legislature about that and
DCC is
celebrating our fiftieth anniversary
we just launched our fiftieth
year of our
fiftieth anniversary year so we'll see
lots of celebration
celebrations this year DCC
started as an occupational
education branch in fact our regional
name was deco
web. Is that
catchy or
what.
Dona Ana County occupational
education branch and
it was founded obviously in partnership
with New Mexico state the 3 school
districts and explore
expressed purpose was really
occupational education or what we
call vocational education and
what we now call career tech
ed if you take a look
at at the chart on slide
15 you will see that
that 65 percent
this is this actually is
is student credit hours so
the number of the net the
classes students are actually taking
in these areas you'll see that
65 percent what we offers
general education and
35 percent of the classes
we take in our in career tech
and these are not the
students and what their majors
are so for example lots
of students who come into career tech at
getting certificates they're
going to be in that greenish
portion and not
in that general education questions
very few of our of our
certificates have a lot of
Janet in them
all career tech ed
associate degrees
have to have Janet in the
1515 credit hours
is what they have to have so when
we look at those Janet hours
they are people who are majoring
maybe an associate of science
associate of art and associate
of criminal justice and intend
to transfer New Mexico state
but many of them in there are
also career tech ed
associate degree
students who are
taking more ticket and I'm
I'll make a patch as a as a
humanities person myself
I'll just I'll just make a patch
that part of the part of what
is essential for career
tech ed students right is
in fact the technical skills they're
going to get to move into an
industry but in addition
to that we know that we want
them to be able to problem solve
to think critically when a problem
emerges up to
to be able to communicate
to to work with our colleagues
and and some of that is
done in career tech at right
just as just the very nature
of that of that kind of that
kind of education some
of that is done in Janet
right some of the general courses
and so I'm I'm
splitting them here
to show you kind of where the students are
taking classes but the reality
is they work quite closely together
particularly for those students who
are we're doing associate
degrees. If you take
a look at at slide
16
what you'll see is the kind of
credentials that the ACC
produces so the very
bottom if you read that very bottom
row you can see
that that we
awarded in
2820192020
over 1500
credentials that
include certificates and
associate degrees if
you take a look you know
going right you can see that there some
lost their over 1300
and then just under 1300
for the last couple of years I
think I think those numbers will
recover and get better I think
those also were impacted by
COVID when you lose 20 percent of
people are rolled some of those
you're losing we're about
to certificate or an
associate degree
and and so I think we'll see those
numbers but it's not small amount
we we probably have 5 or 600
students come to graduation
and and we have many more who are
earning earning credentials
of a variety of sorts.
So I want to talk
a little bit about what's happening here
because
because.
I do think that what's happening in the
southern part of the counties
incredibly exciting from
an economic development perspective
and I I think you'll you'll hear
kind of with over the course of the next few
days some of the things that are happening
here I know that
that the B. I. A. that you're
but be talking a little bit
later incredibly
exciting to hear kind of from
from his perspective the work that
the work that the industrial
park is doing but
let me talk a little bit about the the
center here so
Senator was actually built in
1996 so it's been
around for almost almost
30 years of
and it's about just under
1990000
gross square foot
if it is what I mean
you can kind of see we're if we're
work closely packed
here. I'll
talk a little bit DAC see
officially use the space
we are the most
efficient user of
of educational space and
in the state you'll
see that our gross square
footage per student FTE
is is 123 and
that that is the lowest
in the state because I think a lot of times people
say you have 6 locations argue
over building but when
you actually look at gross square
footage per student grant student
FTE that's not true we're not
we're not
overbuilt and if if you take
a look at the someone
participation center of
all the locations of DCC
that is I would say
most efficient and the and I'm not
sure I'll talk a little bit about the
problematic but there it's
73 gross square
foot per student
FTE.
I and and
so I'm I'm saying
this is too efficient.
That that this is not providing
students kind of the space
that that that they really could could
benefit from so as a result
for those of you who are local we
will be we will have a
local G. O. bond
but we will be on the deal bond
election this fall and
one of the projects
is someone
parked addition additional
additional capacity here at someone
park part of that has
to do with we need the additional capacity
given the student population
the other part of it is really
we see so much economic
development happening here
we believe there's more we can
do on the education
side in working with what's
happening in in the southern part of the
county.
The other thing the up the rest of
that money will go for its its
its Representative $60000000
the rest of money because one of the
things is changing is
how we do education
for example weren't weren't I do
not believe we're ever going to see you
know desks in rows
again right that's
that's just not how
that's just not how education is working
we're gonna see these movable tables where
people what we're gonna see 2
things one where people can
collaborate and 2 rooms
that our tech enabled
we've started to build
much more flexible tech
enabled collaborative
spaces we've got one of
these being a campus one of
the east
mesa of
one at Gadsden I
think we pry have one slated for
here as well but but support
that money is like how do we create
taken able spaces where people
can collaborate because that's how learning
happens and that's
I think students are just more
interested in that sort of learning of
20 percent the other thing
some of the other expense
dollars will go to safety and
security how do we make our
campuses and and location
safe and safer and
secure
so when we talk a
little bit about academic programs in
general again
we have a we have a large
GED and adult education
program here they do the high
school equivalency NCSL
we do a lot of dual credit
both here well all
3 of the 7 county locations
in addition to the ones in Los crucis
here we work closely with
with gas and Independent School
District we have
a number of face to face classes
here most of the face to face
classes at some part
alright on the genocide
of in in in
part.
Because it's it's challenging
to reproduce major
labs it's expensive
to reproduce major labs
now ask as the population
grows and gassed
and at that the someone
rather before
the. Pandemic
was we were serving about
350 or 400 students
here right now I think we're
between 200 to 25
again I think I
think those face to face
students will come back for
additional face to face
to but
there are a number of their quite a number
of majors that students
take can take face to face
classes here
online classes from from
the other locations
and get a degree without
having to leave their home
right there
are many students would
like more options down
here and and will will
continue to work on that but there's
quite quite a number that
that they can they
can do that but one of
the things we also see in the south
is what the students want to start here
and then go to New Mexico state
so students can do it
get a 2 year degree here
again face to face
and some online and then
transfer to New Mexico state with an
associate of arts and associate of science
associate criminal justice those
those sorts of degrees.
But I wanted to talk about 3
projects that I think really are highlighting
some of the economic development work
that's happening in in the
southern Dona Ana County
and particularly in this area
I and I'm gonna I'm gonna start
with nurse but we
we just started our very
first call board of nursing students
at Sunland park
we knew that there was there
was some growth it needed to happen
in terms of health health
sciences we knew that there
was growth that needed to happen
in the southern part of the county in the
first program that's been able to do
that that has
that we've built the capacity
but also there's lots of
interested in nursing we
have had many many
students want to be nurse
and so we we were trying to build
capacity down in the southern part
lots of that has
been completely
possible
because of funding the legislature has
made available for nursing
programs just just no doubt
we would build capacity much more
slowly had we not had
access to additional
dollars funded by the
legislature so so
we're we're grateful
for the work that you what you've been doing
and in that arena I
think in the long term we also were
interested in starting a respiratory
therapy therapy program
probably at
the aspen center
again trying to expand
health care in this in this part of
the county
and and I think our covert
is fairly small this post could first
cohort may between between
812 students but it's
the first cohort and it'll grow
at I have I have no doubts that
that it'll grow because there's
such a need for such interest
on the students aren't as
well the second thing
I want to talk about a small business
development center and and again as
I mentioned this took a lot of
work on a lot of people
sports and I'm grateful to the
the state SBDC program
because because
they.
They basically floated it for
a year with some funding from what
they floated the idea I
got some one time funding from the
legislature and then really work the
process state to get permanent
funding this is an area
where small businesses
abound right
many many of them
and of many
many particularly very
very small businesses who just
need support they need
information about how to start
a long how to launch a successful
business and how to grow a successful
business and so
we were very happy are
David this is
our
advisor or business adviser down
here he's been on board I think maybe for about
a year and we're seeing
booming business very happy
to see.
I think actually the the the
slide that house an introduction
to some part actually
has our our sign
off on the street that has just
be seen on.
The last thing I'd like to talk about
is it's like
23 is the
union Pacific industrial careers
academy the ACC is
very very grateful for funding from
union Pacific we
know that they're going
to be that there are
jobs in this
region that need
very very specific technical
training and so with that with
a grant from union Pacific
we started what we called the industrial
careers academy that the
3 programs that there
that that
we're teaching out of that correct
County one is we we have a truck driving
academy in Los crucis but
we're we're teaching truck
driving here see so we have CDL
program here that's
going from what I hear gang
busters lots of people
lots of opportunity
for CDL drivers the
second thing is we offer
forklift classes here and it's
for forklift certification
which is a one day certification
gangbusters lots of people
are interested lots of need need
for that as well in addition
to that based
on some funny we also got
from the state adult
ed program we have bought
several simulators
that of train people
in automation and
logistics fewer
students in this
if you were in New
this is also
true we have a
manufacturing program at the ACC
manufacturing electronics
incredible jobs all over the
county in those areas
we have trouble recruiting students
are working right now with with
economic to the
data and
also with the city of Los crucis to
say how do we think
about recruiting why aren't
people attracted to these jobs
that are really desirable
jobs with incredible
salaries of why
and so and so we're doing a little bit of work
on that but
here the union
Pacific industrial careers
academy I think is a
really incredible
example of how you can
do short term
training to get people into
the workforce as soon as
possible and that's that's
what that's what that Academy
specifically designed for is
to get people skills quickly
and get them into the workforce we
always want to see them back in the
educational institution at some point in
their lives but.
Many people need a job
today or tomorrow
and so with so the academy is really
meant to get them to
market.
That's all I would be happy
to answer any questions if you
have them but thank you for your
attention thank you for your support
of higher education and
I'm so glad that the committee has been
here. Well thank
you and and I do have to correct
myself chancellor
Torrez which is
still something
fairly new so
congratulations on
that
and so we do have
Representative Garrett Senator
Griggs and representative
Armstrong
and representative
Duncan anybody
else.
Okay Representative
care if you will go ahead
thank you madam chair thank you
chancellor 3 quick
questions on the first
is in your system do you have
any teacher residency
programs
serving
either.
Post graduate
post BA or
undergraduates in
your system the done on
this.
Madam chair representative
there
I'm not familiar with residency
programs I don't believe we
have any in in the community
college systems it
but but help me understand
that.
Madam chair it's it's like
I think Santa
Fe and
scene of both have residency
programs that
they've worked
out.
Madam chair representative I'm not
familiar Representative Garrett we check
on that okay thank
you madam
chair and entrances
David how many
instructors to have in the
Dona Ana system
and what percentage are full time
what percentage are at
jokes.
Madam chair representative there we have
a doctor
we take a of.
About
13325
of them or so pretty
close to that number are full time
faculty and the rest part
time and it
varies from program to program I
would guess that if you
take a look at general education
we're probably talking about
if.
3540
percent full time 60
percent of part
time if you take a
look at the CTE programs which
have much smaller programs but
also much more specialized
we're probably
8027520.
Thank you one final question madam
chair in chancellor is
this very exciting to hear about the
industrial careers academy
one big issue with
our 2 year
colleges is that
some of the professional courses
required fees because they're
not credit
so in this
does your careers
academy
does our students
having to pay fees that
are not covered by the opportunity
scholarship or or other
forms.
Madam chair representative garret
Macy.
I can give an answer that I think is
correct
in this case because it's not credit yes
they do pay fees so this is
operated by our non
credit
unit which is really a
self sustaining unit
so they do pay that because
it's not credit is not covered
by it is not
covered by of the opportunity
scholarship however having said
that there is some legislation and
I don't have a number in my
head that
was.
That I think the secretary higher
education recently worked on
because it it had the
word work study in
it and it was dollars
actually allocated for
workforce
training
that could be it
appeared used for this
sort of this
sort of training for
students
that the issue has not
been so as not been worked out
that those dollars and I and I can
get that I I'm sorry that I I
don't have the bill in my head
but I can get that information
to you because
we think that
it's too much
money.
To only be used for work
study because
I think we can cover we can we can
cover some of our works at a lot
of all over work city needs with some of
that money but we really
needed on the work for sites that
people are hung up because they
can't afford the
$100 fee or or
something of that nature
thank you madam chair thank you
chancellor thank you Representative
and and thank you chancellor because
those are some of the things that that
I always encourage is
you know if our speakers aren't able to
answer those questions that
drive but as if you could send
your responses to Erin and then
Erin will send it to the entire
committee so that we can have
those answers I really appreciate
that next up is
Senator Griggs and then following that
representative
Armstrong.
Thank you madam chair and and
thank you madam president for being here
it's it's it's
always good to see where our
community colleges are going
other than that Alamogordo
cagey and we see that
but.
You guys really have to
be candle light on your feet
to have to be able to Josh
to what the
needs of the community
are as
well as the academic
needs of the of the
institution you were part
of
you have down
here
you have direct
competition between
you and they'll pass
community college
how is that how is
that playing out is it
make it difficult
here or you
gauge have
a great relationship where they
do these things and you
do these things
or or have
had you guys get
along.
Madam chair Senator
Griggs than the very
question.
Very good very good
question we
do we do not have
of that sort of agreement good
idea but we
have that in place
but what we do is
there there couple things 1 of the
things we've done recently
is we we
have a New Mexico state offices
we've just never offered in the in
the branch campuses and
that is what's called the
135 tuition waiver
for students who live within
100 35
miles of Los
crucis right that they're able
to pay in state
tuition plus 10 percent
is what we do that and 1
of the reasons is because as you drove
here you would you would you
got I probably on
your on your
car
you got some welcome to
Texas.
Welcome to New Mexico
welcome to tax
that what we're finding is we have people
living across the street from each other
some of them are paying $90
a greater $78 a credit
and so we're paying $225
a credit even even though
they're really part of the Anthony
community they're really
part of
of the some part community
but they they're on the wrong side
of the street so so part of what we're doing
is we just had what we recognize
that we're a regional we're
region. And
I feel like what's happening in
the economic arena
in this part of the county we're
really region right we're
region with plus crucis
of Paso and what is
right and so as part of it is we
recognize part of a regional
economy and that students
students may live
on the other side of the street but
really really they're going to
serve in some cases New
Mexico
we we in we
don't have so I as I
mentioned we don't have that sort of that
sort of agreement but we don't
have a lot of
people if they
see us
and they know that the ACC in
NMAA you
they really will come to us
right unless
unless we don't have something they
offer
if they see if their el Paso
community college people they
really it really is there is
this kind of affiliation with
an with an institution
but I I'm not I'm
not hearing that we have a particularly difficult
time because of a pass a community
college it which is surprising
because you see
them on the freeway is you're coming
from Los crucis Los
crucis to to a
passive.
Thank you for that matter Madam
chair representative
that.
El Paso community college
had major
grows and
Dona Ana County
community college or Dona ana
community college
has experienced
quite a bit of growth as well
show which is showing
us that there's opportunities
down here maybe for
for everyone those of
us who are.
Cash graduation graduation
New Mexico state I can't
understand why anybody want to
go to school at el Paso community
college you to
look at that make any sense to me
whatsoever but however
some people do
have. I
noticed on
your Shannon
park educational centers
allied your your
support services
side and one of the
things you you put on there
is a cashier sure
which and I
don't I don't know
exactly
what that is and and
madam chair if you could talk
about a little because
one of the things that
I she is
getting away from.
Cashiers it at
all to we're we're
going to self
checkouts and
issue is just related
to that ours is related to
something different.
Madam chair Senator
Griggs it
it is something different is it's kind
of prior to that
a lot of times what would happen
is we would have
cashier Services
in Los crucis we would have cashier
services at east
mesa so the student
needs to do some sort of transaction
for their toolbox for
example an automotive
and they're the just being a campus
they would have to drive to east
mesa.
To to do that and so so
some of this is a little bit of
kind of legacy of the way we
used to operate the students
can can do
can can make transactions
here
but we are going more more like
tronic I mean
that.
The pandemic I mean everybody was
forcing of the pandemic accelerated
that but that so the cashier
Services kind of
again are a legacy
from the way we used to do business
kind of in person but
but we're moving more in the direction of
students have the option to do it electronically
as well.
Thank you for that and and madam
chair one.
One of the things that you
guys are more
shut up to deal
with
and.
Whether
whether we we
intended for some of these
things to happen or
not in part
of our.
Discussions in part of our
changes in
in minimum wage
structure and and
things
we
encouraged.
These issues to go
to.
Self checkout weather
encourages right we're
not it's it's
certainly a word
and
when when those
things started
happening.
Yeah we're we're doing
things it that correction
those entry level
jobs and
so hello hello
or or you.
In in watch
in that sort of
change.
What are you looking at
doing the in in the
community college station
to maybe help
people.
Be able to
get above the entry
level
for.
What what can we do
because some of these some
of these jobs are
going to be gone forever.
And people who have
had a for years
and years.
Won't have all.
What are they gonna
have what opportunities
will be for them so they
can continue to
make an adequate
living and hopefully
even a better living
but what can we what
we do want to
address things it in the
changes that we're seeing
in. Because
they certainly exist and
whether it's completely
driven by the change and
and wages or
or.
We're changing
and we've got a we've
got to help people
be able to do the
things that they can
do to support
themselves and their family
show have how are you
guys looking at that at that
shortage challenge.
Madam chair Senator breaks there
there are a couple
things one is
you know the young folks
today really are growing up in a different
world certainly than the one I grew
up in New and one of the things that's
happening is things are changing
so rapidly
technology is changing so rapidly
I mean a I you know I was
reading the newspaper A. I. last
summer some.
It's exploded
right I mean the world is
changing rapidly
technologies change rapidly so and
sore job so one of the things I
think that we really need to be thinking
about all of our educational
structures is how do we help
people think about change
that to normalize
change as as part of what
we do in educational environments
I think that's one of the things but
the second thing and I think more specifically
to some of the questions you're asking
this is how do
we how
do we help people
find
new careers
new skills
in a in a in a
affordable way
in a way that's pretty easy to
access one of the things I absolutely
love about community colleges
is the is the fact that and
and the the great thing is that
merry Olrik who runs our
our non credit training
program thank you for
more who runs our advanced technologies
on the great
on the credit side they have a
great relationship and they're
really thinking about how do
we use short term create
training opportunities
to help people pivot
quickly
right in addition to
that how do in
in connecting them is that
maybe they maybe they need a
6 week trek 6 week training
they need something maybe the
forklift training which is one
day.
How do we then open the door so
that if they need additional training
they they're able to get that whether it's
on the credit side or the
the other credit so it's I think one is how
do we normalized change its
have it that's the world we're
living in right now and to
how do we make those opportunities
accessible and affordable
to them and and I think for
example I what I love is that is
that on the non credit side we can
we can put something up pretty quickly
what within a matter of weeks we
can get some some training
up but also
talking with the I. you know I was at a I
was at a workshop over the weekend
and the person
who is leading the workshop said you know I'm a third
grade teacher and I'm looking I'm
looking for another career I
kind of read I've done this I really
loved it ready to move something
and so I'm I'm talking
to to a friend at the ACC
it somebody who works for us
and and trying to figure out what the options
are so how do we make that more available
to to folks in the
community.
Thank you for that madam chair
that's that's really all I have but
these guys are on the.
On the front lines
of trying to help people
move ahead with their
lives and so as
we look at at funding
opportunities we look at
any number of things in the
legislature
they're the guys are going to
put together some of the
things that let
these people move forward
because some of the jobs that
we've seen that we grew
up with won't be
there anymore and you
can you can simply go back
to the day
when.
Some of us remember some of which may
not even remember this but
you go back to the day when you
pulled up into the gas
station and they
filled your your tank
they wash your windows they did
all that stuff and
I didn't happen anymore hardly
accepted in order it was
required in order to
recently
but.
We need to help them be able
to to move
quickly and nimbly
because these things
education for
changing and they're changing
right now
and we had to
be able to do something that helps
them help people
so thank you madam chair and thank
you for your interest thank you
senator and and I do have to
adjust to.
Personal point of privilege and and
my capacity with the green chamber
and also my colleague Debbie Moore whom
you'll meet tomorrow with the greater
Las Cruces chamber
and chancellor photos
it you know I have to to commend
chancellor Torrez because there's
always whenever there's an opportunity
to create training
programs she's
always like how can we do this
and it's really meeting the workforce
needs and looking
at that and understanding that throughout the
state and I and I I think
is an example we've had some
other presidents
of of like C. N. M.
Tracy at
CNM of
I think all of our community
college. Residents
and chances are like we know
what we need in our communities
so let us you know give us the
freedom to go ahead and create that meet
those workforce needs so I'm
really really grateful and
and we also know that return
on investment for a lot of these
certificates and
accreditations the
return on investment is much higher than
higher ed
and so somebody who has
2 master's degrees I'm always like
talking about the importance
of workforce training and how we
really need to do that Representative
Armstrong here next and then representative
Duncan. Thank
you madam chair and thank you for your
presentation I would just
also add in
of public
education that we
in our own communities know what
our students need
so along with the
higher education the same
thing so I would
include public education in that as
well I have to say this is a
friend of mine on the front on this
page.
Yeah I went to high school with
her. And
so I was like oh my
gosh. I had
to take a picture and blow it up because
that's how long ago was
up
so I
was happy to see her little
smiling face on there and and
I've been following her and she's
a
single.
Grandmother and
I'm happy to see she's
she's creating court
career changes for herself
I one of the
interesting things that I found
out last week
at highland university
is that it was
brought to our attention
that people
are having trouble and
I just wondered if it was happening in this
area
applying for
the scholarships
and confused about
the lottery
and and everything else
and when the other one kicks in
and opportunity kicks in
are you seeing that as a problem
and do we need to
to look at navigating that
differently.
Madam chair representative Armstrong
I do believe we're seeing that I I
can't I can't talk
about any specifics but
I received a
communication couple weeks
ago from my
from my the
financial aid director at the community
college saying we're really
struggling with this one of the things
I think we're trying to understand is
what is a problem that might be in the
system the NMAA you system and
how we how we have financially
to the Parcells and
what is a problem at the state level
that's a disconnect between
kind of what the institutions need to
get that money out the door with the state
needs to to get the money
to us so yes but
what I think we are seeing some challenges
there okay I just
want everyone on madam chair to take
note that that's happening
and that we need to fix it
if we're going to have
free college
we need to make it an easy pathway
for students but we
also need to bring PED into
the picture because a lot of
this needs to be happening at the high
school level I
guess of course with you
know people that are out of
high school but
the new the kids coming out of high school
need a path
paved that makes
it easy for the parents
and easy for them
I know there was talk about
making the fast for
mandatory and
I would really highly
discourage that
because.
People some people know
they're going to get help and some people know
they're not going to get help.
And so I would really discourage making
the fast fun
of mandatory
the other question I had
madam chair was what
is your total capacity
here if you had
everyone and every
seat feel filled
in house
not
online.
Madam chair representative Armstrong
I do not know but I can find
out. Thank
you I was just curious because
I I want to see
compare I mean everybody
talks about square footage
per
student but I'd like to
know what is the actual
capacity because if
you are filled and then you
could still do online.
That would be tremendous so
thank you madam
chair.
If I could ask Miss clear for you and your
thinking it every.
Every seat filled
like through the day
use it using it as fully as
possible yes
ma'am.
Thank you representative Representative
Duncan and then Senator
Diamond.
Thank you madam chair
Chester would you explain
to me the difference between the opportunity
scholarship the lottery
scholarship.
I can explain a bit
but but not much I here's
for me when I talk to I'm sorry
madam chair representative
Duncan the
the the big difference for me like
when when I was citing the numbers
at 202000 the
biggest difference for me is
that part time
students have
access to those dollars and returning
students have access to those dollars
for the those are kind of the
critical
differences
I don't know that I can
tell you with any kind of
reliable.
Any any other different
distinctions between the 2 I have
not looked at the fairly recently
for those are to the big differences
that have impacted
us.
Thank you madam chair so
I guess my question was the
lottery is strictly coming out
of high school and the
opportunity is for those are coming
back what if I sit out a
semester is that
opportunity available to me then
as a one
semester out of high
school.
Madam chair representative
Duncan there are they really
are the people who knows I
can get this deep I think
actually you have
to start school within at least
this was the only within
6 teen
months might
I I could be wrong let me know let me
not step any further into
this.
That we may not but I can I can find
that out. Thank
you thank you madam chair I I
honestly I was curious
about exactly what those states
were and so so thank you very
much thank you madam
chair.
Thank you Representative Sierra
Senator Diamond actually
Diamond frankly my
correct the senator formally known
as diamond
yes.
Come up with a logo for
your madam chair
chance are I would sure quick success
story the Dona ana community
college's it really
impacted there's a junior in high school
in truth or consequences New
Mexico mid football
season that the program was
abruptly
halted and
I'm sure this is K. with many
small town
of students he loses
interest in school because
the reason for making those grades was
to stay on this academic football
team and has no
desire really to to commit
himself to school anymore and
as the branch to make somewhere
school that if he
is if he is going
to pretty much check out of public school
there's an option to
attend Dona ana community college
to get the GED
program so when this program
they actually take you through the classes
yes for the GED
and he passes with flying
colours wallet don't Hannah
they also make him aware
of the electrical lineman
course that they offer to one
here program he rules in
that program he
just got offered last week a
job with excel that starts
emit $58000
plus an additional $6000
living expenses 100
percent of his benefits for a family
up to 4 and a
vehicle and he starts in
Carlsbad he's 19
years old.
That is a story that is my
brother I'm proud to say
that is a story in which
you reach a part
and you make a difference in someone's
life it's also a testament to
us as legislators and
to my family my dad is an
act of professor of New Mexico
state that a 4 year
degree does not
equal that is not the only
pathway to
success that's the
value that this community colleges
bring and really make a big
difference I also think it's
testament back to your mission
statement that saying that
you are here to make sure
that communities have
access and then a
budget because we're
state government is
failing I was a
collectively as a legislator
which good thanks
at least we think we do good
things and we get on our
community and realize
there's one there's no information
on they're not accessing
the the budget that we intend
to put out there inside
I think the representative
Armstrong hit on that
is legislators we
don't know what we don't know and so
we get back and we find out they
don't know about the scholarships
or in your case
right after we pass the
opportunity scholarship
from from Dona Ana
there was a student was told without
opportunities gosh it doesn't apply
to Dona Ana that did
to her credit which was incorrect
right to our credit they
didn't know anything we had just
done because the state had not
informed them of
any of the funding
opportunities that we could just change
for students it was all
kind of in real time
so as
legislators we seem to also
be a complacent in
allowing these agencies to
work in silos you don't
know what PED's doing
you know we're not telling you the funding
mechanisms and
and that's we're kind of we're failing
you would really ultimately
ultimately New Mexicans by not
getting that information out
but but I want to tell you you're not
and we can follow this model of
allowing people to know that
excess access
to then see the benefits
I also wanted to touch up just a
little bit about Representative
Garrett if she saying that
there are some courses
including CDL forklift
drivers whatever it may be
and we are not providing state
funds that cover those
certificates. It's very
important to give us this information
as we go into a budget here
you could argue that
those students may need access
to that funding even more than
the resources people have
to to attend a 4 year degree
so if that is the place please
let us know sooner than
later so that we can I
think it's our intent to make sure that
we're covering a providing those
and we find out that we're not
and people may be turned away and
discouraged from from attending
those are are getting those
that's not the intent of the legislature
we want to make you know
that that education also
available to them so please
let us know if there are
loopholes that were unaware of
a specifically on half so
again thank you thank you for all you
do and and the difference you're making
special with our will
kids.
Thank you Senator Diamond
greatly Representative
Zamora.
Thank you madam chair and
thank you chancellor
so you
stated I believe in in
your presentation that you were
down in enrollment.
But then you're asking for more
space can you kind of get into that
a little bit and
tell us maybe
how long you think it'll take
for for the come back
you know on on filling up the
space that you have an
and then maybe get into
how the
the efficiency is hurting
you the small space
that you do
have.
Madam chair of Representative
Zamora
we we were there was a period of
time when when we were down
I would say probably 2010
to 20 probably 2008
I I think if I were to look at
statewide that
I think we've seen a decline
across the state
I think there I guess there are a couple
things 1
is.
There are facilities for
example we we pass a local
bond recently we're building
a a creative media technology
building in Los crucis right
now and
and in some
cases
people say well why are you making a
case for that building because your
enrollment is down that's
specialized.
Your technical education space
and the space that we are training students
and was just was simply an out of it so
I think there are times when
it when you have to say what is
the need here in terms of the
kind of space and can
we retrofit something
right can we retrofit
or or do we need
some something you in that case
we felt like we needed something you we're
getting pretty close I think in Los
crucis for our trades
programs to having to think about how do
we do a major retrofit
a big because those buildings
are are also if there's a specialized
the in the
in in this particular case in
terms of someone park
73 it and I think
it's I think it's a fair question
for representative Armstrong to
say I think that was
you representative Armstrong what is the space
actually look like how are you using the
space and and not just gross
square footage per student
FTE
I think that
so so I think that's a fair question
to ask institutions say what is the
space actually look like when it's filled
or important or not
filled but there
are times when I think
that it's
pretty efficient to put
people in
rows.
Right I mean that that that really act that
literally comes out of an old industrial
model right
the way that instruction is working
now it really is different
it is more collaborative it
is more tech enabled and
so part of what we're seeing is
just instruction itself
is is changing
and and I'm not sure I
don't know I and I have not done
this we probably done the space studies
I don't I'm not aware of them with
the state what what how does that change
the way you can fill people into
space you can put people in space can
you put the same amount of people can do with
your people people but those are the
sorts of things are changing
and I and I don't have all of the
information
I do think this is always
been this this is not the smallest
Chaparrals the smallest it's a
very very small
location but in
terms of the number of students were seen in
the space when
when they are face to
face and again this is
the first Mr are feeling we're seeing those
numbers since before the pandemic
it's it's just it's
crowded right so
how do we adapt the space for
career technical education needs
right how do we adapt the space for
learning needs and and
then how do we take care of if it
was just always a small
facility
and and we just never had adequate
size and then how do we take care of that
those are the kinds of things that will be thinking
about Representative someone.
Thank thank you madam chair and
thank yous testing that's all my
questions.
Great thank you so much are there any
other questions before we left
the chancellor go and and
we move on to our our next
presentation.
Right thank you doctor
thank you.
Thank you members of the committee it's
nice to see you
thank you again for hosting us here
today.
Kind of our next co hosts
they're providing lunch as
well.
You know when we have a tour later
on of the border
industrialists association the first
time I came out here Jerry Jerry
market economic guidance
exceed
just seeing the sites out
here I think you were going to be
absolutely amazed
at what is going
on out here in
the border the border
area so.
We are bringing up with us now
Jerry Pacheco who is the president
of the border industrialists
association
and the executive director of the
international business
accelerator also

a little bit we're we're
actually ahead of what
we're normally our 30 minute lag
on our time so thank

providing the snacks
and very excited about our
our tour this afternoon so
Jerry and
and creating a minute let you go ahead and
start.
You madam
chair members committee welcome to
southern.
Welcome Southern New
Mexico
beautiful the in southern New
Mexico 1.of
housekeeping madam chair
I know working to take the 2 we have
a bus arranged to take the
tour I know there's a
dinner tonight ability cruise
Billy Cruz is about 2 miles
down the road it would
probably be best if I
have the bus go to Billy crews
to pick us up there that we the committee
members are taken from
here to the industrial base
back over here back to Billy
Cruz if that's alright with
you.
Okay I'll make those
arrangements
thank you again
as you mention madam chair I'm
of the executive director of the international
business accelerator we
are part of the small business development
centers network New Mexico we
have Mr David
adults who runs or someone
park center here in
our state director I think Russell
wirex back there somewhere
so we work to
build small businesses
the IBA's we call it
is the international branch
of the small business development centers
we help companies go global
either exporting or
importing
we do research for companies
we help companies get out of
trouble if there is
trouble internationally
we also out of my
office run the border and national
association with the state's
largest industrial
association we have about
130
members
we represent the Senate we should
denture base we advocate with
the legislature with the governor's
office we solve problems
and we deal with government
all levels and we
also out of my officer contracted
by what's the New Mexico
partnership which recruits
promotes New Mexico throughout the
world and.
Companies to the state so
if you will please
I'm gonna go through this as quickly as I
can the next
slide on the flip side
there is the industrial
base in Santa Theresa
you got for industrial parks as
you can see right there
the Senate we should chip work which
I think I'll talk a little bit
about but I think what was going to
talk about that sure you
are you on the on page 2
yes okay thank you excuse
me yes so just flip
over the pages of we
go we
have the Santa Teresa port of
entry which is that
little yellow.with
the red outline on
that we have about
70 now we're up to about
75 companies I just need to
update this we have
about 6000000 square feet of
industrial space and about
we support about 6000 employees
where the state's largest industrial
basin
next slide our
international business accelerator
Josh will school who's with me
here part of my team
tracks exports exports
as an economic indicator
of the health of our economy how
how well we should
be New Mexico made goods and
services to the rest of the
world and
so if you look
at our export
growth to the world
that the next slide on
page 3 there slide 3
is a graph of
all 50 states exports
to the world by export
growth percentage.
It's always beautiful
when we in New Mexico
I am a New Mexicans
that down the I
love my state but
I I get
so
frustrated sometimes that we're
number one in the worst
thinks.
We're number one in export
growth to the world
we lead the nation
in export growth percentage
and that's because what's
happening in the Senate we should definitely
some make that case
next slide please.
Until this last year we
were leading the nation in
export growth percentage
to Mexico you see
that of almost but
yellow line that's Washington
state and that's an aberration
so Washington state
made us number 2
last year but for the last
10 years or so we've led the
nation in export
growth to Mexico I
would expect that that aberration
goes away and we again leads
the nation in export growth to
Mexico.
And that excites me because when I
started my career 32 years
ago as working for the governor
king
administration
back then I used to have to
testify that the states
of the
Delaware Connecticut and
Iowa exported
more today Mexico X.
more to Mexico the New
Mexico so we're right
in the middle of the pack and
I think we're punching above our
weight.
So the next slide
on page
5 shows
that the the ex worked
kind of went down
last year but that's because
of China
we have a big company up and
Sandoval County Intel
and Intel does this with
China there was
times when Israel was
our number one export destination
because of
Intel shipping the chips over
there Intel's
influence in terms of
being able affect exports has
gone down as we
grow the borders industrial
space for down a little bit
last year but our exports to
Mexico on the next page page
6 you can see
one up so as long as we
keep increase in New Mexico
exports to Mexico we're going to be
fine.
Next slide on page
7 I love the
slide because you can see
the Green Line is total
exports The New
Mexico exports to the
world the
blue line is
Donia anis
metropolitan statistical
area we can track exports
based on MSA
that's the blue line
then if you look at that look
at New Mexico to Mexico the
blue line and the redline are
almost exactly the
same so what what
can you infer from that.
Dona ana county's
accounting for about 60
percent of the state's exports
to the world
and we love Los
crucis beautiful
town
university town retiree
town federal government
town don't make
very much up in Los crucis
what's getting made and exported
is out of the Senate recent national
based.
Next slide please.
This is a slide
of the
top 10.of
entry in terms of volume
of trade on the U. S. Mexico
border you can see
the Santa Theresa is the
sixth largest port of entry
now on the US
Mexico border we're gonna see
the Santa Teresa port of entry
and you get a state that's accountable
that that little port of
entry will
more who's got the
responsibility of of the of
getting this $200000000 to
expand the port of entry so.
Yes so
I expect us to pass eagle
pass Texas this
year if not this year
next year will be the fifth largest
port of entry.
Next slide.
Page line
is slide
the indicating the
north bound commercial
crossings and you can see
we've had a healthy healthy
growth at the port of entry
that port of entries only
had 1 major
modifications since it was opened
in 1993 and that was
1 extra commercial
lane added so now we
have 3 and
we're now doing more business
at this point of entry then
the bridge of the
Americas in downtown el
Paso it's just incredible
what's happening from Santa
Theresa.
Next slide please all
quickly review some of our
recently committed
completed projects in the
Senate we should denture base
at will table should
be open quarter one of
next year advocate wills
one of 3
Taiwanese companies we
recruited in the roughly the last
3 years when
you see you see in the news
reshoring you're showing
this is actually happening
in Santa Theresa
3 Taiwanese
companies and one
Chinese company that we recruited
here symmetric
is the second time at Tony's
company the do bar code labels
and by the way and table those power
cables
motion is the world's
largest manufacturer
of adjustable bedding
and that's a Chinese company.
W. silver recycling
just at 120000
square foot unit areas
logistics you'll hear from my buddy
are Dennis Miller lotus on the
logistics session
they just at least
145000 square
feet and because of
what I'll talk about here
a little bit the overweight
zone we're recruiting
a lot of agricultural business
to to Senator which those
are 2 Mexican produce
importers and there are
in Santa Theresa
because one thing
we established an overweight
Carlos old for
trucks the truck from
Mexico can be loaded up to
96000 pounds
if they cross the border into
divisible load they have
to off load to 80000
pounds to to get
into the United States
we legislatively
modify that we created a
12 mile zone in which those
guys 6000 contracts
can come what was
an annual permit unloaded
there were all school back or they
can load in the Senate we should
denture base and go back to
Mexico it's been a
heck of an economic development
tool to attract business
and both of those companies
which recently located
personally told me they would be here if
it wasn't for the overweight so
so that's beautiful
economic development.
Recently committee completed
speculates inspect buildings a
speculative
building
you build a building then you'll find
a tenant or tenants to occupy
the space if you don't
have that space available
then a company that says
I need to move it in 3 months
you don't have the space available it's going
to take 12 months to build a building
for them they're gonna go on
down the road tell pasal
so being in the
spec building
business is extremely
important and right
now we are 100
percent occupied we don't have a space
for these there's one building that's
being completed
and that's 135000
square feet but
we have all of this new
stuff going on
we have one company that's
building
actually let me let me go
back here that bill
315000
square feet of space
least built
365000
square feet square feet
space before the building
was even completed that was leased
out and then we have our
local billionaire Mr Paul
foster right down the road no
pasal who's built
to spec buildings each at
183000 square
feet all
the.
Projects under construction that would
be page 12
here's another value added
agricultural company again I
it excites me because that's an
area that we traditionally have
not had in the industrial base
Diamond onion is an onion
processor the process onions
and potatoes that's
the brand new rail spur they'll
have 80000 square feet
of production space on that real
for
we have Louisiana pepper
exchange out of New
Orleans
they do Chile match to
mash is the basis for your hot
sauce if you ever go to
McDonald's and get a spicy
McChicken sandwich that's
their spice and
I'm excited about this company
because when this company
locates in a certain
place all the spice
companies tend to come in behind
tend to be an anchor tenant
we have a metals distributor we
have not announced this yet because
I'm still waiting on the company's
permission they just broke
ground in their building to 75000
square foot warehouse
Monty is in the
lower left hand
corner at a Cincinnati
Ohio they do metal
fabrication good paying
jobs in fact we're
going to be using the industry careers
academy here to fill those
jobs we have Frank
mountain packaging
which is Mr Paul foster's company
he already has
140000 square
feet of corrugated
space coordinating operations
make cardboard for packaging
he's building a second
50000 square foot
building next page
the new spec buildings under
construction the same
company that built the the first
2 specs I mentioned
is doing 2 buildings at the
same time so they're
doing a 220000
square foot building you can see the dirt
work there then they're
doing a 425000
square foot building
and the next slide shows exactly
where they're going to be located
this is my next door
neighbor up in the industrial
base they built
135000 square
foot building that's being
completed there are going
to build another
35000 right
by the first building
at the border we have another
20000
the land's been bought the signs
there there by. It took a
undergo construction.
Next slide
up slide
14 I just want to
put that in there that we're actually
getting a little retail
there are some restaurants
so the loves truck
stop of all the exciting stuff
we have going to **** if you took a vote
that would be the most popular thing
it's just 2473
restaurants beautiful
truck stop but we're also
getting a couple of restaurants you
1 is
in my office complex and
then the she won't cattlemen's
association
which has the the
borders largest
cattle crossing they
just put in their own little diner
which the Mexican food there is
excellent. Next
slide.
You Pacific project
union Pacific as being an anchor
tenant and if you
recall some members of
the committee may recall that
the legislature passed in the
governor signed a diesel
tax abatement for
this company to
even out the taxes that they pay
in taxes and New Mexico
this company is run
been an anchor tenant in the sense
that we're recruiting rail
based companies that
are going to Senate rescind Committee
New Mexico because of the union
Pacific project and
about a year point 5 ago the
this is a
$418000000
project he imagines
like twice the size of spaceport
in terms of the investment
they just invested another
$20000000 to expand the
facility.
We get to see that today for taking
the tier the cattle
crossing we
often forget to mention the
economic importance
this thing is is worth
about a 0.$5000000000 of
trade a year the
cattle crossing
there are a about to get
to 600000 head of
cattle my buddy done in
months and not just from I think you runs
that both sides of
the border are owned and operated
by that you won't cattlemen's
association so we have that
important investment they're.
Next slide to slide
17
this is truly a very
exciting thing I can mention a
resident billionaire
well resident billionaire has act
created a chunk of
land between the
airport and the love's gas
station and he is
already submitted plans to
the county to do his own
industrial park to
really get a brand new industrial
park some
well capitalized money
right there going in and
we're gonna see growth for
the foreseeable future
now next slide slide
20 if you tally
up the
construction on the Mexican
side fox could
not has 1000000.5 square
feet of space foster's
just right across the border if you
have a strong army can take a rack
and you can hit the other side
support. They
do
140000
dell computers a
day that come through
our port of entry.
Update and if that's
not enough there adding a
1.2000000 square
foot expansion to the
plant they're bringing
Evey production to bring in
components production
and always get the
question what does that matter to
us every
time you see a manufacturer
located on the other side of the
border the greeting 3
jobs we create at least one
job here right now
we have I'm gonna
estimate.
About 450000
square feet of leased space
that's tied to Foxconn
tied to Foxconn in the way that it's
supplying of
the building of those
70000 computers
so as foxtrot expands
we're going to get more business on the
side which is imperative
again that we have leased up
we have legislation restricts
we have a gummy bear factory
on the other side that was just
built about a year ago
220000 square feet
of gummy bear production
830000
pounds of gummy bears a day
it's gonna be very haven't for those the
incoming
players.
If that's not enough I mean
the the the demand for
gummy bears is going up because
working they're building another
280000
square feet for more gummy
bears this
company is I don't
want to free come out of
this and that it is not
cannabis is not cannabis infused
it's a legit you know
there's not there's not
pertinent areas
opportunity as an
opportunity
yeah
so
this company estimates that
last year they made a gummy
bear the amount
of gummy bears and maybe they
could give a gummy bear to every human
being on the planet that's
how many coming versus guys
make. GMC
is a an east
Indian
investment group they're building
the first section of the paper
mill rate across more
and again I emphasize when
you of bills on the other
side of the border we get a piece
of that so all right
now between
order that that just out of shape
and I skipped dislike excuse me
madam chair
of.
I skipped a couple
slides.
Senator will project you see
those on 18.
And then the Senate
pressure us the space
under construction is on page
19 I got what
I get so excited
talking about what's going on to get ahead
of myself if you
look it's slide
19.
That's the Santa Theresa space under
construction got the 2 suspects
from Blue Road you
got the abi actual 130
5000 screen completed
another hundred 30 5000
you've got the borders back at
120 Frank not
packaging at 150
the metal fabrication company
at 80000 Monte
at 75 Diamond ani
in Louisiana pepper
exchange we have
1.4000000 square
feet of industrial space under
construction I'm gonna make
you bet.
I bet you that that's more
industrial space space being built
here than all of the rest
of the state combined.
Next slide so it
only will space talk about
Foxconn sunrise
GMC
and Jeff Gordon
proven thank you
very much members of the committee
that the legislature you've
decided to invest in our
jet port
$20000000 they
are already out to bid
on contracts we're going
to strengthen the runways
make them 100 feet
wider we can we will
be able to land
757
jets by the time
this is done we're gonna have a
cargo airport here we're going
to compete against all
pass.
Finally madam chair
members of the committee one of the
exciting things we're doing with and
I miss you we started this
about 6 years ago
we are.
In a project to establish
a desalination
plant in Santa
Theresa according
to the water engineers and
scientists were sitting on a
lot of C. they say it's
a sea or brackish water
and while we
have plenty of water
right so we have plenty of capacity
right now as water
tightens we want to get
caught flat footed so we're
already deep
into this study
the admissions Tax.technologies
being tested at the key Bailey
Hutchinson plant in a passel
which is the world's largest
in the land the cell plant
they will have the final report
done in October
and although the feasibility of
doing that now or in 5
years and that will take care
of our our water supply
for the foreseeable future
because not only
what we're seeing growth in the industrial
base there's about 6
housing projects of when we
take the bus to go up to the
industrial base you can see
the tremendous amount of
housing construction that's
being done up the road
here. Finally
I don't have a slide on this but
I will mention it through or
into a I
B. program international
businesses celebrate right a
program about
67 years ago we
establish what's called the supply
the supplier program
I had like 1 of those
you Rica moments when
I I I
knew this but it just became
clear we about
were up on them the measure here we're
supply base pretty much
a supply base to
Mexico K. which
we ship them components
metals corrugated
stuff or we bring
stuff finished out of Mexico
in warehouses and
transponder I
kept thinking well
we are guilty sometimes
of being our own little world
up there on the message how do
we get how do we
see a college reaping
the benefits of the border
throughout the state how do we do
that and then it occurred
to my team wait a
minute you know we
do surveys of the
industrial base periodically
you know how are you going to create some new
jobs what are they going to pay what
your problems 1 we
ask all of our members
every day that the open the
door what are the
consuming well
let's shrink up
a short lubricants
Center gases
landscaping services
and we created a chart of
everything that the industrial bases
is utilizing
their and then literally
I got in my car and I
went all around the state
with that investor base and
every economic developer I could
I handed that to
the to them
and we started
getting success
is the first 1 was in
Hobbs
down the road Senator Gallegos
is a
constituent we have a
company up in Santa Theresa was
making portable lighting that you
see on construction groups
and the they were building
it in China. And
they hated it because
it was kind of shoddy the
engineering it's hard to re
engineer and
the there's a company called
Watson hopper out of
harm's that
is a fabrication
entity we got
the contract to do 16000
units of this stuff
and then we kept going going
going and I think you'll
see who's in the other room
getting your lunch
prepared.
Told me that we're up to about
$66000000 worth of
contracts out of
Santa Theresa that we've
spread around the state
Osho company out of
Albuquerque RT
electric out of Los
crucis
remediation company out
of trouble at all.
We've got like all this
going and we have
the ability
to connect the border to the rest
of the state which is what we want
to do because we don't want
anybody to think that you're down
there how do you affect us I
mean what good are you
guys to somebody in place in
my hometown of espagnol
well as our supplier
that can do this or that would
have. We
can't promise you that you can get a
contract but I can't promise
you that I'll put you in front of
the supply chain manager of
fire so that
programs been very very successful
through our IB
program so madam chair
thank you for the time to
percent thank you Jerry
and I think for those of us who know you that
was probably clocked as one of the
fastest speed
presentation.
So I know a lot of information
and and you know a lot of
this we're going to see when we go
on the tour this afternoon I'm
I'm very grateful that you coordinated
that just because I want all of you
to see what is
happening market
was going to go to you next if you
are if you're alright with that and then we'll
open it up and representative Armstrong
wants to ask questions and for
some of the folks just let me
know.
Madam chair members of the committee at first I want
to say that Jerry's
been promising you
know to get us some gummy
bears for you know every
every single meeting that I've been that
and. We're
still waiting we're still waiting for the
government
so.
Madam chair I just wanna see we
have an incredible
opportunity here in New
Mexico
you know when you're talking about near
shoring and and
and all these you know companies coming
information.
They're all looking
at this region.
And this region.
Everybody's looking at New
Mexico.
We are the opportunity
for the region.
You look at el Paso el
Paso saturated
we have the ability
to make our
entire border Blix
region much more
competitive.
So who are we and members
you do have the packet there's plenty
of.
Up the border Authority when is
the you can see our our beautiful
building there right there by
the border.
By the port of entry up
when executive branch the agency
where were created to
provide leadership
assist in the development of
public and private
infrastructure.
Really set a regional
agenda not just here in New
Mexico but also in
Mexico of be
the leaders are here on the border
and Services liaison with
federal agencies
well.
It's important to highlight
that the agency
wasn't always
doing too well and Jerry you won't
let me lie about
this.
You know 4 years ago the
HSD had to projects that were
stalled.
We had no revenue
or our revenue was down
up general funding
was insufficient
and then we turned it around
we're really turned it
around in the last 4
years now I'm not
bragging I'm simply saying
this is how it
should
work.
Now in the last 4 years we've we've
had 3 focuses
and and the
you know to get Jerry will let
me lie in this I think we've
done an incredible job as
a team to advance
critical water
infrastructure projects on the border
Jareth just talked about some of those
we'll go in a little bit more
detail we've been
able to expand
collaboration
not just here in southern New
Mexico working with our
partners in the private
industry local
governments but also
in in Mexico we meet
on a regular basis with
folks in Chippawa
to us what is Mexico
City I mean when you and
I were both from the area we we
can we can switch back and
forth Spanish no problem you you
were in Mexico City the confuses
with the Mexican delegation you know but
we're not where we're for the New Mexico
side but we've been
able to expand collaboration
and and that's critical
because what
we're investing here in the US
side we want
Mexico to mirror
those investments in order to
have that true benefit
you know what you're just talking about all
that opportunity all that
growth.
US. The
state with your help.
We're gonna make it make
it possible to expand that even
further and honestly again
I'm I'm not lying everybody's
looking in New Mexico.
Another important part of the agency
has been strengthening the border
Authority again and as I talked
about 4 years ago we
weren't in a good
position as far as as
our revenue our revenue was down
you know I had to go up to the legislative
finance committee Intel
please give us an
opportunity give us an
opportunity increase our general
funding in and so
you know I I think we've been able to come
around our
revenues going up we're we're
always looking at adding new
contracts or
projects
the start off with the projects
this is that we're I think we've we've
excel.
Again you know our first
priority was advancing
projects we had to stall
projects you know when when
I came in to the
agency 4 years
ago we were able to advance those
projects thanks for
your support
in thanks in support of our our
industry partners and agency
partners and we were able
to push for new new
projects on the next
page here you'll see
this graph this
is a some of the key
state investments here on the
border. That's
not all the product does not all of the
projects are funded but these are
the main projects that are funded
over $107000000
in investment here on
the border coming from
the state governments
and that's not including what we
expect is going to be an additional
$200000000 coming the
port of entry very soon
Jerry I the committee we're going to get
that done is going to get that the
but significant
improvement insofar
as the investments you on the
border I think you know we've
been able to Townsend the
the potential
in and thankfully you all
have been listening our federal
partners have been listening
in and again all of that is going
to creates you know
significant opportunities for us
here one of our many
projects and this is
one of the projects that were stalled
because when I came
in there was no agreement as to
who would who would own
this project as a border highway
connector this is going to be a
new highway between
so that that is a
the Peavey diminishing highway
and whatnot.
Of that's the first phase of that
project eventually we want to connected
all the way to the Texas highways
so we have you
know nonstop
traffic
moving between so that that is
a all the way
to the order I
will say is that is that I will support of
entry in in Far East el
Paso that's the vision that's
what we're going to go up
but this is the main project again
it was stalled when we came in
now it's fully funded I'm
gonna turn it over to Julio
of humanities are deputy
director just to give us an update on
where that project is right
now it
and I I brought who you
in because you know I
I want him to start
experiencing you know this
interaction with you all
and in so we can feel what
I feel a little bit.
Chair most of or the other which
is our me under the
bus.
That we we don't we don't but yes
thank god thank you for being
here thank you for all your help the
user you get you've given us
to the agency just
to let you know all
it's a really basic you guys you
can see a face a alternatives
the this project will read this
this phase is already finished we're working
on page B. which will give us the
exact alternative for
the for this role what are the
benefits of this short instead of
you going on P. W. T.
to our craft ward I tended
taking let's say
2530 minutes or more
because I don't
down that road sometimes and there's a lot
of traffic this role is
gonna take you in 5 minutes to 10
minutes to midnight.
M. or something part was still
no it also make Marcos
commute much shorter
yes Representative is that the real reason
that's why you.
Once once a direct
role to his house actually
that's the north
that's that's the
the main point of this road I'm is
gonna help us out a lot it's a game changer
for the area this is going to track
more industry to our area
as well as something Sentinel
anymore so that's gonna help us on
a lot.
Next page
please.
Then we'll be able to see
that the signage to son
had only able as were
going on the 2 you'll see how
close we are and
how all of this what they're saying
to say today when
we do the tour a lot of that will
all come together because there's so much
here I've had the
benefit of the tour and
so just
it to give you all context
is that they're they're
dumping a lot on our plate right now
because there's so much going
on but when we
do the tour a lot of that
will all make sense to you and
they'll make those connections
and before we move on I
wanted to quickly highlight
the that so this is this is where
we're at as as who said the
phase a portion of the project
is a feasibility of the
project it's already
fully funded we have we have funding from
the federal side
and also from the state
side but what you're
looking at here are the possible
connection so you have Pete V.
Domenici here on the left
and you have but not
road on the right
all of these are alternatives
are between you know
about a mile from the border
on on the equipment you have as you
leave the port of entry
to as high as highway
9 so highway
9 was included
as an alternative because
you know of the possibility of
connecting the Columbus port of
entry as well but
again as as Julio said
all of these are just
alternatives the phase
be part of that
project
will determine the the
the preferred alignment which
would then go over to the
environmental and and
final design of that project but
again it's a point to know that we're
in the earliest early phases
of this project and it's already fully
funded that that's how important
this project is very as
it is here in New Mexico what a
right wing connector all romance
from primary
I would you can see face HBs
being exported expected completion
at the end of this year summer this
year and that will follow
the the following up
as part of the
study
also wondering about a little bit
about us but that is a port of
entry. This
is a major
project.
the investments and
the greater part of those investments
are in infrastructure development
obviously and then of
course in the projects
themselves.
As in a community economic
developer I'm concerned
about the return
on investment for
communities so
my question is what are the
social contributions
that
these.
Corporate the corporate
presence that we have because
it's a significant
presence
things like how
are they investing in
education how
are they investing in
daycare how are
they investing in social
services how are they
working to improve
madam chair the
overall
on social
economic
conditions
and and lifting our
communities out of poverty
we know that we've
given significant madam
chair tax
abatements and other
types of lucrative ways
in which to
entice
this corporate presence
but I'm really concerned when I
do drive around
and I see
that we have still
a great deal of work to
do to uplift our
property our communities
from poverty
and so I
think I'd like for you to just
just talk about that a little
bit and in maybe
give examples of
what those contributions are
thank you madam chair.
Representative robocup
colloidal madam
chair.
One thing I the collected to
put the front here's the Santa
Theresa charitable foundation
so I won't see
3.
We get a significant
amount of donations
the the STF was
recalled the charitable
foundation is focused
on educational programs
and development in this gaps
in school district so
every year we raise money
for kids so we
do live in a very impoverished
area I mean it's a weird
dichotomy because of the street
that the Senate old Santa Teresa
Country Club pretty F.
feel affluent some of
the work 30 percent
of the households live in
poverty in some part
and so a
lot don't have.
It connections
so we focused on doing
a lot of things we we
find out that there's people of
kids that can only
for one
uniformed.
To wear to school so
we do uniformed donations to
scholarships we
do
this. Clemente
go to 6 grade
classes were
funded to go to Washington
DC and to
New York City and to
us that sounds that's right
that's a nice trip.
What do these people never
left someone
park I'll tell
you an anecdotal story here
one of the principals was telling me
because we funded some field
trips the
kids got on the bus that we can go to the
apostles of down the
highway all of a sudden
all the kids moved to the left side
of the bus you know why did
receive some of our mall
right off the highway
of those kids with that
that were sent to Washington in New
York.
The the issue with
things a lot of them
couldn't rule unless we brought
suitcases we
brought suitcases where's
all that money come from the
industrial base
for example if
you Pacific it's been
a big big partner kids
back there funding our
programs to to the to be able
to to sponsor the
kids again
we've been doing this 23 years
of back then I thought to
myself you know we're
again we're like a little island
into ourselves you see
have people go chair
plants go home and please
pass right through some part and don't
think anything of it so
we're really trying to get the industrial
base connectivity I think we've done
about $750000
with the contributions to
the educational programs here
I think we're about
750000
our general golf tournament is
next month
September 15 that's our
big
fundraiser but we do have
corporate sponsors but you
that contribute to what we're doing
here. Thank
you madam chair and that
and I want you to highlight that
because saying I'm aware of
that
next question final
question it has to do with
how were these of
corporations these
businesses.
Employing
or offering
apprenticeship
programs in order
to be able to go from
you know they're they're
education
educational pipeline
into
positions job
creation but more
important to have good
futures rather than just
a job career development
and I know that Dona Ana of
French Canadian going on
a community college
has contributed to
that pipeline
but I it real
specifically are
these companies
or how how can we help
you
increase
the apprenticeship
approach to
creating a long
term sustainability
economic
sustainability.
Representative madam chair a couple
of things.
The Dona ana
community college been a fantastic
partner
we I
have about 3
good prospects I hope to close
all of them to come
the first call I usually
make is to
merry already and I don't I
put her in touch with the
HR person to the person that
needs help
whatever we have hiring
of or need for hiring
in the industrial base we go to the
community college but then
also the county
sponsored
internship programs this
summer with high school
kids
a lot of the kids particularly
here in some part don't even know
that there's an industrial base up on
the message here and so
in my office we actually had to
the interns County sponsored insurance
we helped provide businesses
in the industrial base places
people the
need for labor
is great and they were not
unusual I mean that's
everywhere but
if if a kid doesn't want
necessarily a for your
education
they can get a certificate
up until going to certificate
program a community college
and rise up really
quickly I mean the the
the general manager of fed ex
ground big big warehouse
that services fed ex
business from the
border to the Arizona
border to truth or consequences
started out when
he was in college just lifting
boxes part time
over the years now he's a general
manager I mean
he's a true success
story come from a very poor
family but the companies
are very open
to to training
people
hiring people moving them
up if you can show up
to work on time you don't cause
problems and you're interested
in and advancing there
is our great opportunities
in the industrial base
thank you and just add
to that madam chair do you
have the ability on
or have you set up a way
to track
that.
Employment plate training
employment
placement
pipeline do have a way of
tracking that because
I I I think it's
really incredibly important
these are the kinds of questions
that I know legislators and
others are asking about
whether our
investments are
actually.
Successful and
how do we measure that
and then how do we report that
success and
it's really important because
I see everything in this
report leaning
towards.
Expansion and
leaning towards development
and all
industrial
related corporation
related which it that's
what your purpose was
but somehow we've got a
show
at the greater picture how
are you know that's
the outcomes what are the
outcomes of these
investments
in our
communities.
Representative madam chair I
I I don't have a way to
track that maybe could be college does
but let me give the statistic that might
help answer that question
years ago when we started
interviewing are the companies
in the industrial base
one of the questions we asked us
what percentage you workforce from
Texas what percentage of New
Mexico and we
started doing that because I got
beat up in front of a a few
committees because
the sentiment was all you doing down
there is creating jobs for
Texans and that's
not true so we started
you know interviewing
years ago was about 60
percent of past ones working
in Santa Theresa 40 percent
New Mexicans
I didn't think that was bad
even though that looks kind
of incongruity apostle
County has 800000 people
Dona Ana County has
220000
okay and we're almost
you know
plus the Texans to come to New
Mexico yes what we take a bite
out of their paycheck with personal income
taxes they don't use our
schools that use of social
services we just take a piece of the
paycheck the last
survey we did
the percentage of Texans
in the industrial base went down
53 percent
as opposed to 40 percent
47 percent
New Mexico residents we've
been very conscious
about doing job fairs
working with community
college thanks
to a workforce solutions
they actually put the
office here in some part
a lot of our companies will not
accessing that state service
because it was opened offices
in just kind of hard
and now you have a representative
right here just a couple of
miles more city so
we're trying to increase that
percentage New Mexican
and a lot of that's who apprenticed
**** programs that's through
actively going on funding
New Mexicans to occupy
the jobs. Thank
you madam chair and just
may I have your I'm I'm gonna be
attending the border
provided.
Meeting in in
October as an
appointee from New
Mexico.
In California
and I know that you
have valuable information
here I'm gonna be sharing this because
our order legislators are
concerned about all the issues
you talk about so
it is it okay to share the
information I just wanted
to make sure that it's not thank
you madam chair and thank you very much
again thank you so much
and I do want to point out that
you know credit to union Pacific
when we talk about like supporting
Texas jobs or
or incomes
there Representative
Lara and I
had asked Raquel
Espinoza from union Pacific
to please give priority
to New Mexicans up
for the industrial academy
and that was not a
problem at all for you Pacific so
I think if we don't ask
it doesn't it doesn't get recognized
as a priority for us I I don't
think it's inappropriate for us to ask
for that understanding that there's
always going to be an exception
but that we're really
pushing to make sure that New Mexicans
get those jobs and get those benefits
and so we have vice chair
Gallegos and then Senator graceful
finishes off.
Thank you madam chair and thank you
presenters you know you Jerry
I've been around for about 10 years and
that you talk faster every year
so I just wanted to comment
on that.
Always for at appreciate
your presentation and I
think it's great that legislators
are going to get to see
the good work you're doing it like
I just said I've been here for 10
years and I think when I first started
and we we just started with
the so
many of these projects and we're starting
to see them come to fruition
and so that's really exciting
I think where we
continue
to
not do as well
is the whole state does
it no what a great
job what a gem this
is down here and how much
growth is happening here
and I think that that's where
we are missing the boat in
when we talk about
you know need to ask for
more appropriations monies
for general fund we
need to really be able to
highlight that we need to make sure that
legislators understand the importance
of that because when we
talk about
the you know Sixtyeight percent
of gross that's happening
here
that's very
significant
I I and I think and I would
encourage you to
really really push that
with
you know the governor's office with
legislators
because I think you know we know
it but we need
the rest of the state to know that so I
I would encourage
that
could you give
an example of
and I know there's there's lots
but just so people
who understand people who are
listening online I understand
what we're
exporting.
Representative madam chair
everything.
The Turkish company here the
US occupying 260000
square feet they make copper
wire of all kinds
dimensions
they do about 7000000
pounds a
month 80 percent
of that goes in the automotive industry
a lot of people don't realize
and I I love posing
this question whenever I'm
talking to people you
do know that New Mexico is a major
automotive up
right. People
look at me like I have a second grown a
second head on my
shoulder.
What one side of the Suffolk side
touch your headliner new car
that's what's being on the other side
of the steel technologies they do
the the role of the cold
steel the gate slip and
part of that goes into
cars C.
N. wire the Turkish company 80
percent of what they do in the
automotive industry across the streets
north wire north side
takes a copper wire
put it into
cables that goes into those
applications behind them
the Tesco German company
auto sensors behind them is do
you think Japanese
company plastic injection
we export so much in terms
the auto industry because
of Foxconn and because it come
school in Santa
Theresa we're heavy in
the electronics industry
also but we
have the the the
state's largest of
cold storage unit
7407000
next time you go by your frozen water
Brenchley the the raw
material stored here
everything we're part of
the global supply chain
little New Mexico we don't
think of it that way
I mean and when you consider the
industrialization it's a great
point Representative part
of our problem is run a different
media market we're on the
el Paso stations north of
tier C. you get the Albuquerque
state so all the good stuff
that's happening here kind of
trickles a little bit through the
Albuquerque journal or what have you
but not as strong as it does
here and we put
this into perspective
2 years ago animus you
did an economic impact
study on the
value of the sentries
industrial base and I was so glad
they did it because for
years legislators have been asking
me what you economic impact
it's like hello
so 2 years ago
the spaceport
did its own economic impact
study during the 15 years of
speech for for an open they've
contributed the estimate
about $1000000000 to the state
economy Phil
which is.
Big in New Mexico they did
their own economic impact study
800000000 here
and miss you estimated that our
industrial base there's about
1.1000000000 a
year so if you
put that in context we're
bigger than film will be to the
spaceport we're not a
sexy you know
we're not Netflix what Richard
Branson I mean I
always see with the meat and
potatoes I'm
here it's not exciting anymore
metal fabrication copper wire
that doesn't get anybody side
but.
Those companies to come to New Mexico
to spend a lot of money building
the plant they hired a bunch of
employees and they're here
for a long time it's not a
geek deals
start to give employment this
is a long term economic
growth but I think you're
right we we tend
to be a little hidden
in the northern part of the
state.
Sorry about that that
yeah the 12
part.
Yes that's right
you also made a comment
about across the borders
it's a 3 to
one.
Hey that for us could you talk a little bit about
that. So let's
say Madam chair
representative madam chair let's
say
the coming their factory
the brand you got me a factory
where they're getting the fructose and
sucrose through our
short line railroad
today if you take the tour I'll show
you the the huge
tankers of fructose
and sucrose we shipped to
Mexico by the billions of
gallons comes out of Santa
Theresa
Foxconn okay
Foxconn has a
system work by they don't
deal with their own suppliers to
get what's called a third
party logistics firm
to aggregate all the stuff
that goes into computer then
they're tied into
Foxconn's
computer system and
they can do a turnaround like in 3:00
hours from Santa Theresa
that's all warehouse
in supplied other senator
research so those
jobs are being built
in on the US side of the
border that are tied to the Mexican
production plant
so I find myself
often promoting
the other side of the border is much
simpler promoting this side of the
border because.
The general
rule. Is
a if if you make
this and a 40
percent of the value of
this is labor
you're probably going to be on the other side of
the border okay
but we're still getting yet the
supply we can still
be in the supply chain to supply
this the electronics
the copper what have you
we have the opportunity to
warehouse and supply that out of our
side of the border.
Thank you.
I I appreciate that I think
that's good that legislators here
that because they they need to
understand how
it is a fluid number
and like I said I've done a tour
many times so I'm always
really proud in
the in the work that you all do
and once again I would just
Fund courage madam chair that
did you all the maybe through New
Mexico true
through anyways
that we can start
to
advertise and
showcase what is going on
down here I think only budget
all of New Mexico so
I appreciate the opportunity
for to make some remarks thank
you madam chair.
Thank you so much US senators
are going to finish off
today.
Thank you madam chair and I just wanted
to just
Jared.
When Washington
state took over
number one and when you
what what happens what
wish to reach.
We have a
Senator of madam chair we
research that that's an
automotive component
that's somehow coming out of Washington
state and I just did
this
I don't know if that's sustainable
I think it's an aberration
because you'll see that
sometimes in New Mexico want one
here. One
your exports to.
Was Norway or Denmark
one up to like top
I knew what that
was a couple of
pieces of fine art Santa
Fe that had like $0
values got sold to
Norway so it's an aberration
and I would bet you some
money if you're betting
then that that
will be the case next year I
think we'll see that
normalized.
Thank you madam chair Jerry thank
you for that because one of the things that I
would I was thinking that
it it might
be is there's a
lot of discussion up there in
the Pacific Northwest
about LNG
facilities
and I thought maybe that was one
of the delusion that occurred
I thank you Mexico's mission
an opportunity with
LNG
I think
Santa Theresa and others
can play a part in that
there's a there's a major Mexican
highway that goes down
to the
Pacific coast just south
of Law.
And I believe they've been looking into
some of that as well so
I think as we move
ahead we had a look
in opportunities with LNG
processed out
through
Mexico
because you for Farmington
for a for the
southeast Asian pipe
it across or you trucking
across
as
compression natural gas
you could probably the interrelation
it down there for LNG
or making
LNG in New
Mexico and then
take it to be.
LFC shipped out to
China or wherever
because you're part of the
stuff that we talk about when
we talk about issues in New
Mexico that
deal with oil and gas related
things
we we forget that are
a lot of the world
that continues to
use or
the gas use coal
if they if they could
take
the uses of coal in many
places in use
LNG
far cleaner
far better for the environment and
we could play a big role in that
hearing care in New
Mexico
one of the things that I've I
want to point out image
it's an economic development
issue in New Mexico
versus Texas
whether it should
be or shouldn't
be.
New Mexico has a personal income
tax Texas does
not. One of
the one of the things that you
hear almost immediately
and competition
is the fact that New Mexico
has a personal income
tax then affect the
business so much it made me
want to be here but it
affects the people that work
in that business shows
there have in the brain people
with some.
Even though the the
property taxes are
less.
Their employee she the fact
that they're gonna be Lujan
money because they have a personal
we have a personal income tax
I don't know that New Mexico can
get rid of that I I
don't know but I
think that we've got to
market better.
When we deal with companies
like that as far as
are they bring employees
and or do we
have those employees
here they can do the
job for that
previous and I think it's
just it's a challenge
for us when you talk about
some of the some of the
bigger
companies that
bring in a high paying
jobs were New
Mexico's workforce may
not be ready for that yet
show I think those are those
are issues that we
we we deal with I think we've
got overcome issues
sometimes in in quality
of life.
We have to show people why it
is that they need
to live in New Mexico
why this
place is better
and in most instances
you know we all think it is
but I can't sometimes think
we get past
Texas and Arizona because
of the quality of
life from our
another.
Jerry I want to ask you to
you know and and
Marco may be as well
madam chair we talk about the
700
trucks that
come out of
at a Senator ratio and
go.
Show more.
Where are the we have a
delivery tracking are they going
north they go on west
primarily going east
we're we're we Ruiloba
going
to.
Senator Amanda trawled
I'll take a stab at that moment more
local kind of
to fund that a lot
of that truck traffic is drayage
truck traffic those shortfall
through the coming from a kilo
bring stuff you're there for taking
supply support from here
take him right across the
border
usually what happens with
the logistics of you here
this afternoon
those traits trucks are are
not long haul trucks
don't know tend to bring
we have facilities called prospect
facilities we have a dock on either
side of the building
Dr drive worst
the truck from Mexico might come
in a little over here might
get package or what have you
loaded on a long haul truck
that goes north
to the Midwest or what have
so it
runs the gamut
and and before turnover to
Markle believe it or not
Senator madam chair
into the 2001
session we passed
the law the legislature passed
a law and it's referred
to as a personal income tax
exemption for non New
Mexico
residents.
With that lot did.
Is it allowed the company
to to come to New
Mexico higher
taxes
as long as it was adding 10
percent to which New Mexico
10 percent New Mexicans
in its workforce every year
the employees got the exemption
they didn't have to pay personal income
taxes in New Mexico.
Worst loss ever seen in my
life we never made it work
with us on a single company
because the way the law was written it's
almost untenable
but it's on the books if you want to
look it up it's a 2001
session we actually created
a borders on
were personal income
taxes are
exempt.
And madam chair jury thanks for that I
can't imagine legislature
ever passion a lot of people
didn't
understand.
But no 11 of the things
I wanted I wanted to bring out
about the the trucks
and H. to to
everyone 1 here
hi we 54 which runs
out of el Paso goes up
goes up to Wichita Kansas
and on into Chicago
highway 50 for the
busiest 2 lane truck
traffic highway in
the United
States.
You drive from here
to
Albuquerque
on I.
25.
Your got not going to see
as many trucks on I.
25 agency
on highway 54.
For the most part they're getting here in
your and they're
going west to
east on
on interstate 10
but.
The traffic that's going
north is coming
up 54
in a large degree
ensures New Mexico looks
at things
for New Mexico to do to
help economic
opportunity.
4 lane highway 54
is one of those things that
ought to be on
everybody's mind
whether it's on the top of your mind
or where it is but if
we can bring that traffic
more of it through
54
we can do we can do more
good for for the
state and those communities
are along highway
54 but
that you all
are you guys
are doing did a great
great job down here
and I hopefully we can help
you with some things and I
want you Jerry I want
to take a crack at question because
it's always been
something which which concerned
me that concern because related
economic
opportunity.
It's a little different than some people
might ask
but.
Can you tell me.
Who came first
or who comes first
the cow boy or the
solar.
Senator business for people
is simple as simple as that
is what it
is.
Okay.
I think you have to have a saloon first to
attract the
table.
Jerry I think you should say
that where you
are I right here but I
think that is something
that. Economic
developers struggle with all
the time is what do you do
you have to have the people
first or you
have to have the business for
and that's what that's what that question
is except it's maybe
a little more
fun to
ask so thank you madam
chair Senator chair I
will say this and I'm gonna put
a pigeon
if there's anything
that you would take away today
that you could help us
it's for water
wastewater system
armados keeping infrastructure
had a development because the day you
can't flush toilets the day we
don't recruiting more businesses
and we've gotten that close
that close to capacity
that close to what have
you I mean a couple years
ago up Google usual last
summer.
I was asked by the water authority
to ask for businesses not to water
their lawns because
the water pressure was going down because
we we connecting these
big businesses
onto a water system that totally
needs to be revamped overhauled
so anything you can do to help us
with water waste water that's
when we need help.
Thank you madam chair for
light on water
issues
especially where you
are. And
the Texas New
Mexico
watershed moment staff
your desalination
deal is probably a
great opportunity
because that are to be taken
water that you're not going
into the Rio Grande
and being able
to be
used in not affect that
any I
believe I believe these
allegations big deal for
our state big
deal over
Alamogordo
but ultimately it can
help us do
things that were unable to
do that.
