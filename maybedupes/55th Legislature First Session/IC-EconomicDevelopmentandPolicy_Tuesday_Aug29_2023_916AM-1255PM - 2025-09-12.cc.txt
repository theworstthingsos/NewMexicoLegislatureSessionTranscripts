Hello hometown

economic and rural development policy
committee thank
you all for being here today for
those of you who are watching on the web

thank you very much
this is the third meeting of the
economic and rural development policy

At.
Metropolitan redevelopment Act the
catastrophic Business relief funds
Ted helping small businesses the
film industry and public
banking and more hot
tomorrow and we will finish off with public
comment before we recess
today there
is I I am we're
in this unique situation in the
committee knows enough to say this
each day
as a disclaimer that many the presenters
during our time here in southern New Mexico
are professionals that myself and
Representative guy goes
have the honor of working with because
of our jobs
and in most cases they are also
members of the Los crucis being chamber
of commerce which time CEO and
president of for
full transparency their membership has
had no influence on their presentations
today and also as
we do everything we can to maintain
committee protocols and a quorum
I also recognize that there may be
times that because of these
relationships our
presenters may not go through
the chair because many of them
know me as
Kerry.
So I will not fault them for that
or correct them I
and I hope you understand this is kind of one
of those unique circumstances
but so typical of
New Mexico so
very very happy to
have some really amazing
people talking about incredible
stuff in
southern New Mexico
well as committee members I just like
to remind you if you request I have a
few of you remember
that the folks who are presenting to our
committee are here at our request
and many people are giving up their day
sometimes pay and valuable
time away from work to come talk to us
so let's be respectful of their
time please keep your
questions to the topic at hand
if you have any follow up questions
you can email those to
Erin and she will get the answers from
the appropriate speaker
I will do my best to keep us on
track and on time if it looks like
a discussion is going off topic I
will bring it back this is
not means meant as a means of
centering any committee member but more
respecting the time taken by our
speakers and committee
members and lastly and
most appreciative all of you here
today and members of this committee
those of you who are speaking and presenting
today just let you know that
this committee is very curious that like
to ask questions which is a really
good thing because they are engaged in the
topics and
so I'm very happy
happy and appreciative
and value the the
the expertise and questions that you
bring to this committee
so we are here at the
Burrell college of osteopathic
medicine school
that has been here just for a short
time really when we start looking
at the bigger picture of things
but they've made an incredible
incredible dance in our
community and also
providing a really
important
service to our medical
community
and I'm really grateful that John
Hummer John if you want to go ahead and
come on up he is the president
and chief executive officer
of the Burrell college of osteopathic
medicine and I remember when the
school when it was announced
and I remember emailing you John
thank you because of
what we need to do in terms
of to bring medical care
to southern New Mexico especially
to our rural communities in understanding
the value of osteopathic
medicine as well so
I'm very grateful thank you for
hosting us today
and I'm gonna let you
go ahead. And do your thing that
you do so well.
Well thank you madam chair and
members of the legislature
welcome we're it's an honor
to have you here
today and
as I always say when I
when I speak at that
these
sessions I want to first
by expressing our gratitude
for the services you provide the
state
you know you're you're citizen
leaders for
our for our state
and you put in a lot of time
and effort on behalf of the
citizens of New Mexico
so on behalf
of our college thank you for your
service to the state
what I'd like to do is I put together
presentation
and thank you madam chair
for the opportunity to share our
story and
I've tailored this to really
talk
later in the presentation
about our economic development are
impact
to our region and and to our
state I've number
the pages so all call out
each page
as I go through this and you should have
a copy in front of you as
well and also John before
you one if you are watching on the web
at click on the agenda you'll find
links to all of the all
the slide shows that
are being presented throughout a
committee thank you John
so as I
we start off and you'll see on our
monitors around not only
this room but throughout
the college is our
mission that is
our purpose that is our reason
for being this mission
was put together back in
2014
before
anything was put together from a
financial
structure to make
this a reality in
the in the foundation of our
mission
is self evident as
far as being a medical school
to
look at the
needs of our state
to provide a response
to be proactive and not
wait
and and to settle for the
status quo but to
recruits
educates.
And most importantly
retain
a fair number of graduates
after their residency
to either stay in the
state or to come back
to the state of New
Mexico but more
than that what
you'll see in our mission
is that we also
saw at that time
and this is well before D. E.
I was a catch phrase as you
all well know back in
2014
there wasn't a lot of emphasis on
it we knew that
as a medical school we could do a better
job
to
educate
future physicians
that represent the fabric of
this to communities in the
society that they serve
so we made that fund
fundamental part of our mission
in the area of diversity which I'll talk
about in a
moment.
On page 4.
One of things were very
proud of is that we just
did not put it into our
mission statement
but we put it into action
and fast forward from
2016 when we
admitted our first class to
today and when
you look at all 64
osteopathic medical school
locations
throughout.
The United States
and you look at the last 4 years
on the percentage of underrepresented
minorities were right number 2 in the
nation
osteopathic medical
schools in
the in in the end the aspect
of diversity and that's
right at 25 percent and you
look at the kind of the national
average of the
allopathic medical schools
hovers right in the 11 percent
range from that from that
aspect so 25
percent may sound small it's all
perspective but when you look in the
medical
profession that
is a large percentage
and we're proud of that but we're not
we don't rest on it we know we can
always do better and we're always
striving to
increase that and provide
opportunities in that in
that area we were
recognized if you see on
page 5 this
past year
as a
recipient of the national
insight
into diversity
Heat award
in higher education
and we're one of only 6
colleges of
osteopathic medicine in the
nation to receive that
award and we're
going for a renewal of that
award this year.
I'd like to kind of
shift into our social
impact
starting on page
7.
Actually this should be the
20202021
and 2023
we've graduated for
classes we
have graduated 500
65 physicians
since our first
graduating class and
2020.
The percentage of
our graduates have been placed
into residencies
is 99 percent we call
that employment
there's 2 that we're
not placed one
we hope will be placed maybe this
year on that so even though they
graduate we continue to work with
them to do that that's
well above the national
average
replacement.
In the area primary care which
osteopathic medical schools
historically
have
had a higher
percentage
of of of
the graduates in positions
going to primary care
you'll see here on slide 8
we're right at 6566
percent we do
count psychiatry in
that the state of New
Mexico has
defined that is
part of primary care and that's why
we include psychiatry
and that.
Additional residency placements
on page 9
and you will see that we have
placed our graduates
into many other
types of specialties
I'm not only here in New Mexico
but throughout the nation
the residency placement process
for the those that are not aware to
national match
no wonder residency program
has a clue exclusivity
to a medical school
it goes to a national match
process there's interviews that take
place so
no one can be guaranteed a
residency
aspect on that
so that's why when you see students to
go out side of the state
it might not be because of their choice
because it's a large algorithm it's
a competition that occurs
nationwide for
residencies throughout the
nation. But
I'll talk more about getting them back
those that have left.
Our regional residency placements
if you look here this is up to
date
as of as of
2023
we have our graduates that are at
the university of New Mexico health Science
Center Memorial
Medical Center
Mountain the regional Medical Center
residencies Texas tech in
el Paso las
Palmas del sole NO
Paso William
Beaumont Paso when university
of Arizona in Tucson
and given the close proximity
the closer the student is
to their their home medical
school the higher probability
that that they're going to
stay or come back
to the area given their close
connections on that so
right now 52
residents are in the state of New
Mexico and
34 in el
Paso.
Other notable placements when
I always mention this it's not on
page 11 not that
these individuals
are any more important
than somebody that is that Memorial
Medical Center family practice
one might argue that that family
practice resident in moral Medical
Center is more critically
important to our state
then an individual about the
Cleveland Clinic for surgery
but what it does speak to
is the quality of our
education which
helps our reputation recruitment
of students not only here in New
Mexico but when you look
at where we have placed other
graduates it does
speak to the quality of our faculty
in our education
and for these reputable
institutions to select our
students we're proud of that
but we're just as equally proud of
not more for those that
are in the state of New Mexico during the
residencies.
Page 12 we always
like to highlight
our students that I know those of
you that are in
this area you've probably run into
our students at health fairs to be
at the that city hall
or at farmers market
I using them at
other safety
net providers in our community
as a volunteer
out in the community
13 plus 0 hours
just in the last 2 years
and that's just a small sample
of organizations that they
support and there's 43
plus student led
organizations
here on our campus of our
students so now
switch into the economic
contributions
which ties directly to this
committee.
Just going to give you an update since
our opening on page
14 if
you look at what
we find internally
ourselves that we
fund for
scholarships we have
funded since
161.almost
1.$9000000 in
scholarships and those
scholarships go to those
individuals that are from our
mission region obviously New
Mexico they
get preference
on scholarships
given of being
from New Mexico
and the next item there is
New Mexico State University part of
our affiliation agreement
we've provided up until
currently 1.$9000000
to the foundation
NMSU foundation
for scholarships
for pre med students for the best
and brightest New Mexico
students coming to
NMSU they
can be duly accepted
their freshman year
at NMSU and here at
the medical school that
takes a lot of stress and pressure
off of them as far as
having to compete for medical school
seat nationwide
and then there in a living learning
community and they interact
with the medical school with
us as well but they also
get scholarship money during
that time
whether in their undergraduate years
well and so that's
50 percent current use
and 50 percent building an
endowment so money can
go immediately and then we're building
the endowment for perpetuity
sakes on that
the affiliation agreement with
NMAA you were the land
we're sitting on right here we have a 60
year land lease
and to look at the contribution
of revenue to New Mexico
State University it's
340 $3000
a year to date
1.9000000 roughly
of contribution to the
state and
then the affiliation agreement
with an issue this is a student
fees and I was talking with 1 of the
representatives earlier.
Our affiliation agreement
we charge the
same student
fee that the graduate
students at NMSU
pay we collect
that we pass that on to NMAA
you and then our students.
Can utilize
in a misuse wholesaler
fitness center they
can also utilize student
housing
the library space on
campus as well
and release the beauty that public
private partnership we're not
duplicating resources and
we're supporting the state
university and vice
versa there supporting us
but obviously economically
it helps them as well on
that.
We also have a
supporting foundation
which I'm not gonna go to a lot of detail
but one of the unique factors is
we do have a foundation
that raises scholarship
money to date
we're pushing close to
$7000000
the foundation is of
scholarships that
are been contributed from
individuals throughout the state
to support students
New Mexico students primarily
to stay in the state
to practice medicine.
And then graduate medical
education we have
a division within our medical
school before
we were ever 12
Mountainview regional Medical
Center
was the first
residency program that we
facilitated and work with them
to become a sponsoring
institution and they have
grown residency
programs there we've
worked with Memorial Medical Center
their existing residency program
to help them expand
that Lea
County we're working with
covenant Hobbs on
a new residency
program
in in Lee County
Alamogordo now has residents
that rotate out in
Alamogordo as
well
the state has funded you all are
aware of the need any money
we receive grants from
that that help us
support these other residency
programs or infrastructure
is is outward facing in
connecting with the medical
community to be a support
mechanism to make sure that
those residency programs are
strong
as they grow as
well so if you look at
all told 11.5
$7000000
since our opening
about 2.$6000000
a year that we're
contributing in the form
of scholarships to students
and to
the other items that are on the
sheet.
If you look at page
15.
If you look at the
budgeted salaries and
benefits
witnesses.
The data that I'm gonna share comes
from the C. a valley economic
development but our our our data
our pay roll our salaries and
benefits after this current
year of
20.$2000000
are budgeted FTEs is
100 56
but our average salary
in this community is
120 9000
563 when
you do a multiplier effect
which was right run by buying
the vita we create
40 new jobs
incrementally new jobs
in the community so when
you combine that together we represent
100 96
jobs and
but more importantly when you look at
that what how many people do
we support in the community
that number 300
54 that we
support in the community as a
result of our presence
here and Dona
Ana County.
Page 16
our 5 year
household spending impact
is $74000000
over 5
years.
I mentioned the 300
54 and 1 way to look
at this is for every $1
that we invest in payroll
another dollar $0.21
of new payroll is created
in the local economy from
a multiplier
effect.
Our investments in medical education
and taxes paid to the
state our total
operating budget
for 5 years
the last 5 years including this
year is
150000544
that's what it is cost us over the
last 5 years to
operate the medical
school. And I
mention that from the
aspect if you think
about if
we were not
privately funded in the state look
to do another medical
school this is
what the
state is not having to
invest in medical
education on
that and
in order to come into later when I talk
about some of the the
public private partnerships
that we have with the state that we'd
like to grow as well which we
think provides a good return on investment
for the state and then the
G. R. T. for 5 years
is 12.7000000 for the
last 5 years of G. R.
T. to the
state as
well.
Now the
really exciting part is what I
talked about with our graduates
on the economic aspect
I talked about the medical school
itself but if
we switch and really look at the
Altamonte goal in our mission
is what.
The impact of an individual
physician to a
community in our state
and these numbers are are well
published nationally
and I cite the source here on
page 18
but for every
physicians placed into a
community.
They touch in
support 17 other
individuals within
within that community
the actual impact
of that one physician
including their salary
and support staff
that support that position is
1.$4000000 a
year on that for
one position.
How many think of the loan for
service forgiveness program at
$25000 a
year and
thank you all for supporting the increase
I mention this in Las Vegas last
week and hopefully
that number will continue went from
1000000 to $13000000
and 724
recipients
between nursing and physicians receive
that so if you invest
$75000
over 3 years or 4 years as
$100000 for us
medical student I take it off for
years and they agree
to stay in the area for 3
years you know you're looking
at almost 4.$2000000
for $100000 investment
so that I would challenge
any our ally in any other
economic development initiatives
in the state that provides that
kind of return we're
not even talking about the increase in health
status and reduction emergency room
visits and what that does
for community which is even
more powerful I think the just the
dollars on
that.
On page 19.
So that we talk about to the strategy
of reach retaining our
graduates our
first data points
is this July is
the first this past
July was
our class of 2020 those
individuals
that.
Finished their 3 year
residencies family practice
internal medicine pediatrics
emergency medicine.
If you look at national data
and we're gonna be trending this
and following this data
we only have one data point right now
so it's too early to to do
this but if you look at national
data for New
Mexico because this is well published
data. If
you graduate from the
graduates of the medical school
those the graduate
and let's say they all
leave the area
they don't stay in the state for
residency on
average 38 percent will come
back within 100
mile radius.
Of the medical school.
Now if
they graduated
here and they went to a
residency in New Mexico which is
why the residency investments
so important you're
looking at
roughly
68 percent
retention in New
Mexico of them
staying in the area and why is that
it's we I think we all we know
is they've been here longer
they for their custom to the state
they develop friends that might have gotten
married they've gotten that
rooted in the community
on that as well so that's
why the GME is so important
on that.
I'll talk a little bit about some of our early
success stories later
on on that on those
items.
So I home page 20
I can't wait to we celebrate the
0 physician
that graduated from Burrell
that's in the state of New Mexico.
And that 0 physician
based on this data that's going to be
$142000000
roughly annually
economic contribution in the state
of New Mexico for those
100 physicians on
that as as as shown on
page
20.
So state
appropriation thank you all
last year we
received $1000000
of state appropriation
to support the following items
that are summarized on page
21.
We were late in the
process.
To be fully
transparent we were
thinking. Based
on what we're doing for the state
should we maybe look at G. R.
T. course you know what
what what happened then we came
up here and said well.
We should have to pay G. R. T. given
a contribution
just how many other people would line up behind
us and say what you're doing it for
them large dinner for
us right so
we thought that probably wasn't
you know the best approach on
that and so we said well let's look
at the services that we're
providing and there
are sole source
agreements there's
contracts in the
state with private entities that
provide services for the state
and we're providing a service and
so it was passed
the $0 we had
asked for some work but more
than that that
we're we were able to put those
dollars to use for
finalizing
the agreement with the
AGD Department
and we plan to execute
that very shortly
if you look at the the partnership
training our students go
throughout I
different regional academic
centers in the state so
we have students that are and
the 4 corners Albuquerque
eastern New Mexico
Los crucis
area
and we started opening up Santa Fe
by the way we just got an
affiliation agreement with same with
the same benefits as well
and will be building that
over time
talked about the need any
support
talked about one of
things we've talked about in the past is
we're getting our students
more embedded in the community
as part of the curriculum
2 or they're actually going to be out with
safety net providers
right there by their side
helping with health assessments health
education doing some
research providing valuable
data as well
on the on the community
admission Medicine curriculum as
well so
that's what that money is going
towards work and we're gonna be coming
forward we've
talked with other individuals the
governor's office with
a larger ask
this coming session
as well to actually
strengthen this
program and
back it up with metrics
and deliverables
that show you what we're doing as
well to contribute to the health and
welfare of the state and
I think one of the things we're trying to do too
and I know many of you agree with this
is to look at health care
is. Ashley future
physicians as just as
important infrastructure and economic
development which is
apropos to this committee being
economic development sometimes
I think I've been in the state 24
years and used
to be on the hospital side
that health care kind of got treated
as as
large
program of
health social
welfare programs on and so
forth but really underneath
it all its infrastructure
just as important as roads bridges
electric electricity the grid
and everything else
and and I'm
biased but I do think that it
from in our ally
the investment in
future physicians and getting them to
stay here committee here is
important.
All all finished with that
2 examples
in this is us to we have other
physicians that are staying in the area
from Mountain View we have
physicians up in Albuquerque
staying but let
me talk about this first one
Dr Mario
opinion on page
22
from Connecticut
heard about our medical school she
interviewed she applied
she was accepted
I came here.
She then went to our rural
track our rural track
for the clinical years year 3
and 4 she went to eastern
New Mexico.
She went to the national
match she
was matched into a
family practice program in
Maine.
And now she started July at
Roosevelt General Hospital per
callous doing family
practice she was
required to she did
not have the low for the for
service forgiveness program
I she's gonna be applying for the program
for fifth act physicians
that are here to do that but
that she didn't do it why'd you do
it because
she.
Met folks from New
Mexico she
met individuals throughout the
community her fellow students
the college eastern New
Mexico the rural
area and she fell in love with it
and she got inspired and that was our
passion. So
our east our rural track
out in in
eastern New Mexico
is doing that are 4 corners
track as well is doing
that as well is because
we believe thoroughly to get art we
get our students out in the
community.
To where they can meet.
New Mexicans understand
the history the beauty of our
state that
there's gonna be a higher probability
that they're going to want to come back.
Is economics important
absolutely because
they're getting recruited all over the
nation and we have
to be competitive on issues
such as malpractice
other aspects we need to be a
competitive state we can't be at a
disadvantage but
all things being equal
or close to equal we
can recruit people back here
when I ran a hospital I I did
that in if you show
people the beauty of the
state and the things that they can do
here verses in a large
metropolitan area we can recruit
and the last example
is Meghan Safka Meghan
grew up half a mile from
here in Los crucis
went to
organ mountain high
school.
Had a lapse of judgment with the
UNM for medical
school.
Years but but that came
here for medical school
and and by the way let me say
on you and it's
been refreshing
doctors Adonis and
Dr fan the new dean
Dr Finn was here last month
visiting first you in person
that actually came to visit us
doctors don't just plans on
visiting we've had several conversations
we have a real excellent collaborative
relationship with you and and
and and we're excited about
that as well but anyway
Meghan is
now opening a private
practice she went to
New York for her residency and now
opened a private practice in
Albuquerque
so that's what we're that's our this is
our mission this is our
vision and this is
over excited about and we
continue we we we look for
to every year.
With our map showing the dots in
New Mexico over future
graduates
of coming back to the area
some of our internal medicine graduates
have gone on to fellowships
in the GI and other subspecialties
we're tracking them
all the hospitals in New Mexico get
a list every year
of where are rather where our
graduates are so they have a head
start on recruiting
them before all the other
national recruiters so they can
start that relationship as
well so with that
that concludes my presentation
and open up for any questions but thank
you for listening and
thank you for what you do thanks
for. Thank you
John and I love the
idea of our local
hospitals knowing when
their folks are going to graduate
so that they can start come courting
them in advance so that they
can have the
experience continuing to have
the experience here and helping our
communities
we're gonna open it up for questions
and because of how we're sitting
I might need you to set sail
your your name but so far
I have Senator Diamond
Senator Griggs representative
Armstrong representative Allison
Senator Shendo.
Representative Roybal cover
yet all who else
okay.
Representative don't
give.
The mails.
Okay I'm sure that something will
happen and other people will be like I want
to get in on that too
so.
So let's go ahead and start off
with the Senator Diamond
thank you and good morning madam chair thank
you Mr Hummer for your
presentation
we noticed legislators we hear all the
time The New Mexico is facing a
shortage of doctors
and physicians specifically in
the rural areas of New Mexico
and so we begin the conversation
about what we're going to do about it that's what
we're doing here right here
today I
want to be very specific
with with you if you would
come to us keep in
mind we're going into a budget
session and thanks to
a strong oil and gas economy
here in New Mexico we're seeing a
surplus of funds
could you be very direct and
what your wish list
and how do we help
you help New
Mexico.
I'll talk about kind of.
What are we go external
wish list and then
I'll go internal on
that external wishlist
I think the malpractice issue
still isn't resolved
I
at Las Vegas those
either Las Vegas last week you
heard some of the this the
examples of the
400 percent increase in
malpractice premiums
for hospitals and
physician practices
and how there's only one insurance
company that's under right in our state
and they may not be around
here we may not have any insurance going
to the west under right just
now I don't
claim to
know.
All the details.
I would think though that we as a
state should be able to look
at the other
states and be
competitive.
Not be way out of the norm
in this area
so I think that's one aspect
that is
it it
is a
reality that
physicians.
Have chosen to either
not consider
New Mexico or
have left now
have other physicians considered
income yes
are they employed by hospitals
that have self insurance and or
other areas yes but that
private independent position
it's getting pretty
scary.
I have a hard time getting to see a
physician and I
know a lot of the doctors and I still have
a hard time and I shouldn't be treated any
differently and you
guys hear it in your communities
you know how hard it is for people to get
to see a physician on that so
I think about practices one that I
think really needs to be
tackled I was
at meeting a
summit last month that
the governor's mansion health care
summit and was you
know you was there a lot of
large hospital systems were
there some a rural hospital
representation and I think that
the take away was that there needs to be
another summit if you will
on malpractice
to really for the state
to get our arms around at the governor
puts what 50000000 plus
into the patient compensation
fund to help subsidize
the private physicians that's gonna run
out so there has to
and we need to be proactive on that's all
amended I think that is the
one
aspect there some
exciting things of the directed
payment program Medicaid I'm
not gonna get too much in the weeds at the
hospital associations working
on to increase
the federal match the one before
match for every $1 $4
of Medicaid money can come into
our state that's going to
help solidify our rural
hospitals because without
a hospital there's not a place for
the position of practicing vice versa
without a position there's not a hospital
on that as well so anyway
that's extra internally for
us. That
helps us we're we're
we're dependent on tuition we're
not states funded
and we're private medical
school our tuition
right now is $65000
plus or minus sounds like a
lot right but if you look
at what the cost of
tuition is state to state
school even though you
charge say
30000 for
medical school that you and
I it I'm not saying that's what it is
close to that.
We the taxpayers are probably
covering another 40 to
50000 because
the cost of an allopathic schools a
different cost model on that as
well so it's expensive
it's a constitution but I think one
thing that we're proud of here
is that even though we're
private at that
number you can go
to to Phoenix
and there isn't a not
for profit osteopathic
medical school charging
$82000.
We could probably charge $82000
and get it because student loans will
pay for it but
I've always said this how much is
enough it doesn't that doesn't help our
mission
we need to be competitive from a cost
standpoint from that
aspect so that's a lead
into what helps us with the
state on looking at
this allocation
we're looking to increase from
1000000 to 3000000
per year from the
state in that agreement
that we're working on to
continue to fund our scholarships
here because with
cost increases and everything else
if we can get some relief it takes the
pressure off tuition
immersed our our our number
one customer is
our student body and if we
can give our tuition
competitive
then that helps from that
aspect so that
is our ask
that you'll be it'll be more formal
aspect it'll come to to
the legislative
finance committee the governor
we're working with the governor's office on
it as well last year she but
7.$5000000 2.$5000000 a half million dollars two and a
half million dollars a year for 3
years we're looking at
3000000 a year
for 4 years
is kind of right now in the
discussions but we have
to earn it every year we just don't have to
come back to the legislature every
year but if we can
go back to the higher education
department show our metrics
all it takes is for them to approve it
to renew it but not having to
go back each time for
that so that's that's what we're
looking at from that aspect
so. That
helps us
maintain a competitive
tuition level and support
these pathway
programs
for the for the college and all of that answers
your question and
and it does madam chairman
president Hummer I appreciate
I'm glad you brought up the the
settlement out issue that we have
because it's going to take a real want
and will of both leadership
legislative leaders
and the executive to make
sure that we can put all the investments
and encouraging people to go to middle
school medical school here investing in
this program but if they
can't if they can't
afford to practice in New Mexico
they're going to continue to leave the
state so it's a 2 fold
investment we're gonna have to invest
invest here and then make
sure that we're doing what we can to keep
them here I
want to be very clear so you're
saying we did
last year legislator appropriated
$1000000 yes used for
scholarships well
that and other things
as well on that page
okay and you're coming
we're really for the same for the
same appropriation you're asking
3000000 I think
as we go into this legislative
session I looked here
just the G. R. T. was funny that you
would mention can we just keep our G. R.
T. cause on that side I was
thinking well let's see we've got
12.$7000000 over
5 years ago investing about
2.5 in G. R.
T. if we could just to
allow you to keep your own
money it seems very
clear that you were spending it far
far better than the state of New Mexico
well I can assure that
so although we may not
waive G. R. tease I think that
that is a reasonable ask
is for the stated a minimum
2.5 I I understand
your ask of 3
so that we can we're clearly seeing a
return on that and so for the work that
you do here for what you're
trying to do to fill that void
expressly in rural New Mexico we
appreciate your service to New Mexico
thank you madam chair
thank you Senator Diamond.
Senator Griggs and then representative
Armstrong.
Thank you madam chair and and
again thank you for the
for the presentation I'm over
in Alamogordo
and.
It didn't sound like you have a
residency relationship
with which in our
Christian issue over
there
could you I mean are you
looking at that is that
an opportunity for you
or or what
Madam chair Senator
Griggs
so we do have
a relationship with with the house we have
an affiliation agreement our students
to rotate their on the
residency we
work with Memorial Medical Center
on increasing
their number of family practice
residents so now they have a
roll track the college
2 plus one in the vernacular
GME to
where they are
rotating out into
Alamogordo the family practice
residents so there are residents out
there now rotating through
the Memorial Medical Center
family medicine program on
that with
Christus we
do have an affiliation with Chris
this I'll just
mention this so we had our first
graduate match
into their family medicine
residents residency up
in Santa Fe which we're very excited
about any time you know we've
we've got a lot of you and and we
have some down here the first
only we were able to get
into
into Chris this is program
at that segments.
Thank you for that and and thank you
madam chair and I'm I'm glad
you you touched on
because I wish my and you
didn't really you more they
touched on our
medical malpractice of me that
was the the next
question that
I had and
you know. I
just mentioned that
Alamogordo is Christian
same vengeance now it's not
it's no longer Gerald champion
which it'd been for nearly
75 years
and in large part.
In large part that's
because of the issues
with medical malpractice
and it's important
I mean the legislature addressed
one part but the
legislature's not address
the other part as it relates
to hospitals
and medical malpractice
and so it's
critical I believe
that we do that or you will
see hospitals
like Alamogordo.
If they can't merge
they will go away
and that rural hospital
in Alamogordo important
lesson Carlsbad and
Hobbs the
services that those things
provide to those local
communities can't be
understated
and we are the
ones shouldn't
appear in when
we're in Santa Fe
discussion hello
all and I think
you in too many
instances we're in an
orange the
impact from the
hospitals
and and what it's doing
to them you know you talk
about.
38 percent
68
percent.
Returning to New Mexico
we're staying in New
Mexico.
We'll see
I mean that number may or
may not be correct
Senator Wirth similar
competitive.
Correct and and I
you know we all of you
will love New
Mexico.
All of us in the room led New
Mexico which our home and
we want it to be the best we
can make it but we're
challenged with
things like that
and there you go
over use go to
Arizona and
you look at the impact
that the Mayo Clinic had
on the east side of Phoenix
and Scottsdale the
jobs the growth
in the in the area a lot of that
can be attributed
specifically
to the Mayo Clinic
and so if we could
if we could use
that model
and promote our
part of the world then
I think we have additional
opportunities here because
it's without question.
Medicine is an economic
driver hospitals are
economic drivers
there's too many of us like
centers sold over there who
chairs callers close to
mine and and we
have to spend time in some of those
places and would rather
not but we we get that
opportunity so
I.
I I hope we can
find the answer to
malpractice could is 2
important
and for you
all.
The Senator Diamond
you know ask about
your your wish
list and and
show. There
are some things that I think we
could address that
maybe could help you
have.
More opportunities with the state
but your your
private.
Show the anti donation
clause in New Mexico
is bound to be an issue
with that
if there's some way we can
determine.
A means to work
with that or work
around that
maybe there's opportunities
to to help the
cage you know we
spend money New Mexico
state we spend money it
at U. N. M. on
Capitol type projects
and and all of
that
you can hardly ask for
that because
it's a violation
anti donation clause.
But there may be changes so
maybe we need to see if there's
ways either
through co op agreements
within an issue or
whatever it might be
and I'd look forward to the
opportunity to
to help you guys with some
of that if if those are
things that are
needed thank you
senator I I we
we have
we only have one agreement
with HSD
on the GMAT
aspect
we're we've had we've received
requests on that so we've
we've gone through the whole
the anti donation
requirements
this this $0
requirement were also we've
gone through that process as well
one of the things that helped on that
is and you all know the anti donation
when it comes to providing
care for the indigent
our students are on the front
lines out in the
communities when
they're doing the rotations
and then our curriculum of mission
medicine and community based
learning actually puts our
students in areas such as the
colonias and other aspects
where they're actually providing assessments
and other things providing care
and education and so
we're able to get we we've been able
to get through the anti
donation aspect
with the remote HSD were
finalizing the one with
AGD right
now but I do appreciate your
support
if we run into any snags
maybe call you on that but
so far so good so
with an age greater thank
yes thank you for that madam
chair and you know
The New Mexico's
fortunate right now and and
we all know
the the revenue stream
is substantial
show if there's means to
do capital type things
those are the things that
that I personally believe we need
to be considering with all
the all the revenues
that we have because
H. it was one time
it may not be back next
year and we just need to be
here we look at
where we can fix
New Mexico and
maybe there's opportunities here
so thank you madam chair and
thank you for the presentation thanks
thank you senator X. I do
we do have representative
Armstrong. Representative Allison
Senator Shendo representative
about coming at all
representative Duncan and
Representative Martinez I do want
to remind folks that
we are about 15 minutes
behind I do try
to wanna so
if I can remind our our
our Mr Hummer
and Committee
let's uh try to keep the questions
and answers so that we can
trying get eventually
back on time
so Representative
Armstrong you're next.
Thank you madam chair and thank you for your
presentation I
learned last week while
LFC
that New Mexico
is surrounded by states
that.
Get reimbursed from the
federal government for medical
up for Medicaid.
More than New Mexico
dad's.
So we're they they're
some kind of crazy formula
that they used
to predict the
reimbursement for the state of New
Mexico.
And we need to be
contacting our federal
delegation
to get them to fight
harder to increase
that that reimbursement
rate I didn't
know that before now
I worked really hard last year to get
the Medicaid reimbursement raise
but that's a state
dollars those
are state dollars we
need to be.
Making sure that we are getting all
the federal dollars that we possibly
can
knowing.
That those are all still taxpayer
dollars but I'd
rather receive one from the federal government
than from our state and we can use
those in other areas so I was
surprised to learn that so I
would implore all
of us to be contacting
our federal delegation
to see if we can get that
that formula changed
for New Mexico
so that's one thing that I I'd
learned I didn't know that I was on the health
committee for for
7 years and I didn't
know that and so that
was interesting that I had never heard
that before
do you happen to know
on the residency
aspect of it how many
residency programs
or or
placement
positions are there in the state of
New Mexico.
Madam chair
Representative Armstrong I do not
have the exact number but I
can get that for you I'd you
know obviously UNM
has.
500 plus
spots very
large which is
great.
Then if you look down here look
at
3040.
Was a maybe 600 plus
or minus
on that but I I I'll get
the exact number I can send
it out to the.
Thank you thank you
I was just curious because I'm
wondering you know what do we have
enough residency spots for
the the amount that we're
graduating or you know I
just want to make sure that we have those
residency spots open
and and
so.
Of course everybody's touched
on madam Mao
all agree with
everyone here
and then just a
comment that New
Mexico spends more money
on film industry
than we do on physicians
staying here in the state of New
Mexico so we
need to look long and hard at what are we
really doing thank you
madam chair.
Thank you representative Representative
Allison. Thank
you madam chair.
I've got 4 questions that I want
to do all in one
sentence in the essence of
time. First
of all hi what's your name of
electricity.
So I need you to tell me the
difference between an osteopathic
doctor and a regular
doctor and the
second part of my question
is can you give
me an example
of an osteopathic
medicine and
the way I understand us
to.
I think medicine
is of
it's a study of bones and things
like that so how is your
practice different
than chiropractic's.
Okay thank you madam
chair hello
Representative.
Madam chair representative
the difference between DO and
MD I'm give you
real quick.
Today it's but virtually
in in distant
indistinguishable with
one exception which I'll come back
to brief history
old civil war
Dr 80 still was an M.
D. he was
disenchanted with the way that medicine
was being performed at that time there was
a lot of surgical
interventions bloodletting amputations
a lot of stuff they just didn't of
thought was not the best way
he was an early pioneer
and what we see today and
and alternative
but to be called alternative
care
nutrition.
Mental health mind body
spirit he
did address the issue of the
alignment of the spine
that if you had a
pain in your shoulder
you should just start cutting
maybe that's tied to something
else alignment with the
body that's a small example
of that's we founded the
profession.
The D. O. profession
over the 0 plus years
went to its own civil rights
movement it
was different it was
unique in its
approach
the allopathic
um Sistema
society positions
fight against it
hospitals discriminated
against the o's did not let them get
on
on the privileges to
to admit some
states California
the state medical society
I think was 50 Bucks back in the sixties
you could pay $50 becoming
MD just to get rid
to DO degree then there's that
whole history of it
anytime there's changes resistance
right but through
all that the profession
grew
that's fast forward to the
eighties in the
eighties
late seventies given
the shortage of applicants
to residencies the
allopathic residencies
started allowing DO
graduates to go into M. D.
residencies the yield
had their own residencies to
mainly a lot of primary care
residencies so
that started populating the
residencies on that
more schools started to
open.
Today.
10 percent of practicing
physicians
indios are licensed in all
50 states
they they can
prescribe same
prescriptive authority
as Indies you
have. D. O.
as in every specialty
neurosurgery to family
practice in between
on that
but 25 percent of all
medical students today
are in a D.
O. chairs was the fastest growing
among the physician
professions on
that.
2020 was a landmark
year
that the residencies
merged so
now the Indies
indios are all 12
the residency programs
by 1 accrediting body
on that
which is
really
a breakthrough in a
recognition of to
where it's it's very much
hard to distinguish
but still today across the
hall.
There is a large
room where the
we have the treatment tables were our
students continue to learn
that the foundations and the
basics of the
neuromuscular system
and a lot of people confuse
that with chiropractic
the difference mainly is the
modalities that they treat
they also learn
pharmacology and
other things to also augment
that so
our curriculum is the same
as a M. D. curriculum
of the basic science to clinical
training with one big
difference as we still do I think is
roughly 880 hours
over 4 years of the
traditional osteopathic manual
manipulation
treatments
and the mind body spirit
aspects of of
health and and and care
I could spend a lot more time on I
try to be brief
but
I encourage you to
look for the in your community and check
about so
thank you for that Madam
chair of
the examples that you
gave it kind
of reminds me of the native
American healers
so it I think instead of calling
the medicine men from no
I want to call us you
pay.
Thank you Mr 0
thank you madam chair thank you
Representative Senator
Shendo than Representative
Rebecca we had and then
Representative Martinez
thank you madam chair and thank you
a number for a
presentation just
the building on the
Representative thousands of
question in terms of
of the last comment to
an inmate communities I know that
the you're talking about
25 percent and diverse
student I know that
back in 2016
or 2015 when you
were approaching the legislature
about starting this
1 focus areas that we looking
at was the American
of how is that going
and what is the numbers look
like. Still
challenging that kind of ties to
scholarships.
The
the native American
students that
apply for medical
school
are gonna get scholarship full ride
offers or
have for a have scholarships
all of the country
so we're building that scholarship
base to
to address that from
a pathway program
COVID really kind of derailed our
outreach out
into the native
American communities
with our curriculum that is
being launched this year the mission
medicine curriculum which we
have physician
Dr McKay's and associate
dean working
on that we're
also working with the extension
office at MSU we have an
MO you to work through the
extension offices
and our goal is up to the 4
corners in particular
and eastern New Mexico because
we have clinical rotations with our
third and fourth year students we have third and
fourth year students in Gallup
in Farmington area
is to implement and right
right you know reconnect
with the native American
published tribes and nations up in
those 8 and definitely up in
the in the 4 corners area
less so in the east because of
location but Mescalero
we talked about Mescalero
we had a meeting 2 days ago
with the extension office and NMAA
you and they have
And roads within
muscular as well
so our
goals over the next 2
years you're gonna see an increase in our
outreach and connecting our
students
with with the
aid of American
communities Madam
has any native American students
been admitted to the school and yes
yes they have
and we've had
students graduate as
well and I can get you that
information okay well we should
get thank you.
Senator Shendo Representative
Roybal Caballero
thank you madam chair and thank
you Mr hammer and and thank
you to the previous
my previous colleagues because
they touched on some of what
I was going to ask
that in particular
Mr Chairman consists of
not concern and I
am.
Thank you mentioned earlier
that there were
the students are
interacting
with various family
health
facilities.
And so I'm particularly
interested in knowing a little bit
more about how they are
with public health or
the community
health
greeny guys and clinics
that are of rail available
in the area and then in
particular more
so
would
how the invention
colonias and as we all
know there's a multitude of
colonias
bordering on the New
Mexico here and
with Texas
next door and
then also County
so
but there's a great deal
of colonias and in this
particular area so
how are the
what is the role of the promote the
lotus and
the the
school is there a
role and
then.
If you could elaborate on that
thank you madam chair madam
chair Representative
Caballero I thank you for that
question
yes our
students.
R. there's been there clinical
years third and fourth here
they are we are affiliated
with the
FQHCs
throughout the state press
secretary medical services like
clinic
in particular the 2 large ones
or with and they
rotate through that
on this mission medicine curriculum
which is a combination of didactic
where the in the classroom were there looking at
population health
social determinants of
health
biostatistics and then the
getting out starting next
semester out into the
community and we're in the
we've connected with
right now we have about 176
slots pushing to 200 more
students that will
be connected
with the
school health
public health
school nurse programs
promised course that will also
go out into the
colonias of
the B. side by side
with them and they'll be
bringing with them basically
assistance in providing health
education some data
collection doing
some projects seeing what
are their needs and how can they
help with that versus just
going in there and say well here's what you need to
do we don't I mean they're
there to learn but also to be
inspired into
and understand what
the barriers are to
health
and you know
Fardeen was Terry talk about what
we're trying to do is go upstream
so they can actually see
what is preventing you
know good care
and then how can they
help with that and make a
difference in the
end result ideally
similar to Dr
Pena who I met mentioned
earlier to have more
individuals that say look I want
to be part of the solution
and I think I can make a difference
and if they don't see it in the not part
of it then that it's
gonna be very difficult for them to do
that but
up and almost working with up and
down was down here
the homeless shelters
you know the food banks so
they're they're gonna be
aligned with the safety net
providers and then eventually
are third and fourth year students and all
of our clinical. Areas
4 corners
Albuquerque eastern Mexico
here to be involved
as well to work into the
extension offices within a measure
that circle thank
you and just real
quickly it's really
important because osteopathic
medicine tex
addresses the ballistic
is a holistic
approach to
medicine and I
think the students
could actually learn.
From the the community
outreach and from the from a taught
us and also
a strong social
cultural practices
that exist that they can be
incorporated
into the cold
curriculum and
practices
that the students learn
formally as they
proceed through the program and
graduate so it's
a little bit of the other way around
to it's a tough way yes
this is actually what it's for exactly
it's community based learning and
for them to learn thank
and to ideally be
inspired to be part of the solution
and I just wanted to commend you and
thank you because over the years we've
been here of
several years now on
different capacities
and that has been one of the
questions that I've consistently
asked and then also
but the diversity of the program so
thank you for increasing all
of that and for paying
attention thank you thank
you. Thank you
Representative role that coming out
of lastly Representative
Martinez.
Thank you madam chair all be very
quick I
just.
I just wanted to get
your.
Take on the
current trend of
up the corporate
takeovers of smaller
practices I'm seeing
the trend happen a lot
in Sandoval
county and Bernalillo
county some
of these private
practitioners that have been in business
for years and years are
now.
Selling the practice
to some of
these out of state corporations
that.
In my opinion not
delivering
the.
Individualized care
that people are used
to going to
those practitioners
I was just wondering if you
had
an opinion on
that.
Madam chair
Representative Martinez
I'm you know when I when you bring
that up and I think when I was
when I first came here in
2000.
And development and you
and when I left did
not have a single employed
physician we was all
independent so I
can't really relate on
a personal level with the
shift on
that I know have
colleagues and friends that are
that are in
the
Business still if you will and
where they've acquired practices
on that I have friends who are
physicians and
I know what they tell me why they have
sold was
because of the
expenses
malpractice has been one of the
key wants to say
it's just it's gotten too
large
the operations of that of
the of the clinic as
well. And
I think at the same time those that
have sold I've heard from them to have some
regrets on
that but then again
they look back it was if it was a
decision I think they had to make
in the best interests of themselves and
their family from a financial
standpoint on that
my opinion about
whether its for profit
or not for profit operators
of clinics it all comes
down to ethics of the individual
running the company
you have not for profit
organizations.
That treat physicians
poorly.
I have seen that
and you just as much you have a
investor owned company that would
not treat physicians
well and there's investor owned companies
that harness
involve physicians in their
decision making
more so than maybe a not for profit
so I really think it comes down
to to buyer beware
right I mean or Celebi
aware who rejoining
what's their mission what's their
ethics
how may gonna be
treated
sometimes that changes right because they get
sold not for
profit sell out to for
profits for profits
in our there's we're seeing conversions
a for profit company to sell it to
not for profits to get you know
to you know get out of that
so my opinion
is is
that
it's an individual decision
and it's really up to them
to to see what is best for
them and really look beyond
just the the contract look
at the people and their culture
and their ethics and the
philosophy on
that I
think in a perfect world I
I I like the independent
physician model
I think
that.
As long as they can they can
thrive and
to be able to operate the practice
so if I had my choice I'd rather have a
community full of independent physicians
and.
Then.
Corporate corporate run medicine
but that's just my personal
opinion.
Madam chair Mr Humber
Mr Homer I completely
agree with you
and in questioning
some of the
private practitioners that
have had to
make a business decision for
their own families
to sell out to some of
these corporate
entities.
The overall comment
that I've gotten back
is that
these this is
caused by the policies
that you was a
legislator.
And the the legislature's
whole have
allowed to happen
so I think we really need
to. Look
at the politics of policy
decisions that we make
in Santa Fe
and how it
those policies truly
affect
everyday
people.
That's just my editorial
comment of the day
thank you madam chair.
Thank you representative Representative
Mason you wanted to follow up with a
question.
Thank you one
question up
speaking for myself
most of my
family and
my friends we don't go
to doctors we
go to.
P. yes
Dr is there
any room in your bill for
that
pathway.
Madam chair
Representative Mason one
of the things that I just a
little bit more background we're going
to reach out
institutional accreditation with the higher
learning commission
which it
allows a
our our college to shift from
a single degree medical
school to health science
university so in our
strategic plans we are looking
at other
degree programs
but we'll be talking to stakeholders
hospitals community leaders
legislature what are the
needs
can they be trained out in the
clinical area
PA is come up
nurse practitioner with
anything with nursing we would not compete
with an issue on
that there's been some
other special
allied health programs that we're looking
at
but were we to be 2 years to
were institutionally
accredited at the earliest
so we are looking at all options on
that where the early
stages of doing feasibility
studies on that but you
we have 7 acres behind here
part of our plan is to grow
in the area of health science
and the health sciences and other degree
programs that
makes sense
thank you with the I just know
in a small town like
artesian you
don't see.
A doctor.
Very so he has
3 of these others that were
poor health you know
in the. It has
to be a serious.
Catching
locally you know to see a
doctor so to me it looks like
a big growth
industry.
Let me if you Madam you don't mind
I just want to say
that our teachers is been
so welcoming you know to our
students all the communities
have and I mention
of supporting foundation
and rate Yates

Hello okay
good morning at chair
and senators and
representatives of the committee
again my name's Melissa teeters
and I thank you for giving us
the opportunity to talk about these
2 these
2 new programs today
well I proposing redevelopment
areas aren't exactly new but there is a
big change that happened this
past.
Okay there is a
change that happened this past
session
legislative session and I'm going to
go into a little more detail
about there are
presentations in your
your packets that were handed out
so we'll just go through it as
we yes
as well as we go
one by one
just a quick overview of what we're
gonna talk about today we're gonna
do some brief
introductions
and then talk about the
city of Los crucis and how
the economic development department
has really shifted our focus
to revitalization
efforts
within the core of our city
which is specifically the metropolitan
redevelopment due to redevelopment
areas and catastrophic business
assistance program and then
I'm gonna talk a little bit about next
steps and kind of build
on what Senator Hamblen just spoke
about a little bit and
I'm gonna turn over to Joanne
to introduce yourself.
Good morning I'm John got I am
the director of the small business development
center
and.
A lot of people confuse us with the
SBA and we're
not the SBA.
Kind of sounds like the SB we
are partially funded by the
SBA and
by the New Mexico legislation
under higher at
so our center here
in Los crucis where house
under and I miss you though
Anna Committee
college
our mission is to
develop skilled entrepreneurs
and strong
businesses which is why
this partnership with the city
just works really well with
us and
we around the state
we have just different expertise
our center here in Los crucis
as we serve Dona ana
and Sierra counties
however we have 18
centers across the
state and we have
R. Lee center which is in Santa
Fe
And next I'll go ahead and pass
it over to
Dappy.
Thank you madam chair
and members of the committee Debbie Moore
president CEO The Great offices
chamber of commerce most of
you I know I've been around too many
years to count
I think you know me well enough to
know that my passion is small
business my passion
is entrepreneurship my
passion is helping our
businesses grow and prosper
within our state
right now I'm very partial to
Dona Ana County but having
worked in Lee County at the Hobbs
chamber on staff the Albuquerque
chamber and in Rio
Rancho a chamber
I am very passionate about
helping our businesses around the
state presentations
are going to be hearing from
Elizabeth and the
follow up with this we do see
our important it can be
replicated throughout
the state
catastrophic is a very
interesting word and I
don't think it really came
into our lingo into
comment and
so how do we help
those that are faced
with catastrophic fortunately
I'm not fun would
we will not face that the COVID
you're my career path
but if we do I think
we've learned a lot
of the catastrophic
peace can
be give
or take it can be the
end of a business if they
don't have some assistance
in so I'm very proud of
Senator Hamblen a relationship
that we have worked with the
city and SPDC
of furthering that all
I'm very partial as well to
the metropolitan
redevelopment Act very proud
to say Senator Hamblen
had Senator Brandt Senator Kernan
sign on 2 areas
that I had served in with the chamber
of commerce and I'm
very proud that again this
is another tool in
our community businesses
toolbox well
one thing I if I can leave
with you is go back
to your districts works your
SPDC work with your
chambers work with your
communities you play
a vital and important
role in moving a lot of
these programs forward
and played a key role in
helping them sustain
and build in our community thank you
madam
chair.
So just let you know we do turn off
like we only have one my going out
of time to just because of feedback
in the dynamic so
I actually have the power to
shut that off so
just look for the red light on
the your Mike is on.
I also have the power to mute
anybody.
But I will.
And again
hi my name's Elizabeth Peters I am
currently the economic development director
for the city Los crucis
I have now lived in Los crucis
for for 6
years the Air Force brought
my family here my husband
was stationed at Holloman before he
retired last year
and prior to living
here I actually worked in rural
Missouri and 7
county region and the entire
population of the 7 counties
was smaller
than Los crucis
so at you know when I
talk about implementing these
programs statewide
while I I
understand in Los crucis
you know we have the resources to do
this stuff and also there's a
piece of me that understands
how much world up were all
I'm economic development in rural
cities struggle so
you know I I sit up here with
wearing 2 hats and hoping
that I can help in some
way implement this these
programs around the state
I'm if you look at the
presentation to
to page 8 so
I was fortunate enough to
sit in front of this committee
2 years ago and talk about
economic development in Los
crucis and the main focus at
the time was
recruitment that was our
area we were trying to get all of our ducks
in a row
and since then you know
we recently announced a
distribution center at our industrial
park it's a fortune 5
RT fortune 100 distribution
center that I can't
say who exactly who it is
yet but 828
studios also has announced
in the past 2 years to
put a 70 $5000000
into our community for their
their studios and and
complexes and then
also we had a local
business electronic care
giver
expand and they plan
on adding 750
jobs
to the community over the next 5
years so you know the
ball is rolling and the airport
also all has added
passenger service so if you're
in Albuquerque and 1 come down to
Los crucis maybe
you should give it a try
so the ball is rolling when it comes
to recruitment and so we what
we've done in the past year
shift that focus to
revitalization.
Because and looking really at the
core of our community and
looking at these areas
that used to be vibrant that used
to be where you went on the weekends
where you walked around you want to
restaurants you went shopping
but now they've kind of become ghost
towns so how can we get
public are how can
we get investment back into these
areas
there's 2 programs I'm just going to touch
on it briefly that are in
your packet that we've
created in the past year at one of
them's a storefront repair
program and
it it allows
for businesses who have been vandalized
to apply for money through our
past funds to be
able to to
help pay for some of that
some of the issues are having
in their business
we also
updated our leader plan our local
Economic Development Act planned
to include retail
something that changed in the lead
a state statute 2 or 3
years ago is that retail can
be included so
we found a way to
allow for small businesses
to be able to apply for Leda
funds and
basically take the same path to
get money but
the main focus today is going to
be on metropolitan
redevelopment areas
and the catastrophic Business assistance
program so those
are the 4 main programs that
we've implemented in just a short
period of time in the
city.
Starting with M. R. A.'s
so the benefit and of an MRA
is that allows for the contribution
of public resources to
private redevelopment
projects without violation of
the state's anti donation
clause and it
demonstrates the commitment of the
city to invest within the
proposed areas so
these are areas that have to be
designated as a
blight
in the city of Los crucis
of and the main one you can think of
is also on on alpha
sale Westacott
show we
currently have a M.
R. A. in our downtown and have
had one for many
years so
what we did is in the
past year if you go to
page 12 we
have an in fill
development overlay district
we brought in consultants
and showed him the entire
district and we had
them do a complete flight
analysis we understood
that realistically the
whole area wasn't going to be
designated an MRA but
we didn't want to give
them what we
believe to be blighted
because we know these main
areas but we could be missing
something so what we did
is we spent months what the
consultants they did their blight
analysis and
we let them determine for
us what areas
they would recommend for a future
M. R. A.'s.
And then the next slide shows
that 6 total areas came
out of that analysis
and then from there
we have decided to go ahead
and designate help
assailants also on and
Westacott so as our first
2 metropolitan
redevelopment areas with the
plan in the next
2 to 3 years once we get the
ball rolling to designate the
other areas as
well and
so what we're
doing now the
designations are in place
that doesn't
metropolitan redevelopment areas
you first have to designate
and then you have to create a plan
and then you can implement
so this year is we
are going to be creating plans
to do these are
these 2 areas.
And then as I
said if as
we create these plans and we
start implementation we're
going to move into that
the other 4 areas
and really focus because
we're gonna have specific funding
and specific resources
brought back to these areas that are are
desperately in need
so I do want to thank all of you
for passing the state statute
changes for the metropolitan
redevelopment area this
past session.
You know it's really going to help
you know it's going to really
work out in our
favor because we're gonna have
our plans in place just in
time to be able to go and ask
for the tax increments
so that's what that the Amorite
the state statute changes were
it was to be able to add a tax
incremental up to 75
percent of gross receipts
tax to an
area and it can only be used
in that area so it's
similar to attend but
without
it's it's not just infrastructure
you can use it and public private
partnerships you can use it
on infrastructure there's just all
of a wide range of uses
and like I said before I do
have a rural background
so well I
I'm hoping Los crucis can
be the first to municipality
to implement the tax increments
State I'm hoping
that we can provide help
find a way for community
other communities to
implement as well there are
currently 25 Emory
plans sitting
on shelves throughout the state in
different communities so they've already
done all the leg work all they have
to do is create
this tax increment put that in
place and then they can instantly
we'll have resources or will
have investment
to go back to implement
their plans.
Liz can I just interject as for
second just kind of the brief
summary is that pretty much
taxes are increased in
communities in communities have
the autonomy rather than the state
to state what that 75
percent of taxes
that that money goes right
back into that community for economic
development after
the economic development department
conducts community meetings
and conversations
and so this isn't something that just the
economic development department comes in
and does they actually gather
input from the communities the
businesses the residents what
they want to see those
changes and then they use
the 75 percent of those taxes
that are crude in that area
to go right back into that
development which is why it
was unanimously supported on the
floor of the Senate and I think it had
a very positive if
not almost unanimous support
in the house.
I'm gonna find it for you
I forgot what the bill was
251 thank you very
much Senate bill
Senate bill 251.
And that's one of the reasons why Senator
Brandt and and Senator Kernan
also supported that
bill.
Thank you madam chair
and came to just to build on
that also I was
I did get to sit next to Senator
Hamlin and be the expert witness throughout
the process to get it to the
Senate floor and
get it passed but
something else to is
while you know I
I understand the city Los crucis
has the resources to
hire consultants to do our planning
process the state
statute does not actually
state that you have to go
through this big expensive
planning process so
for these communities that don't have those
types of resources
you know you just have to
go through to the public meetings
figure out what the needs are and
then just have a plan
adopted by your your
local government whether I like
city council
because that's that's all it really
takes and then you can ask for the
increments so
it's what I have
found with both
working through the catastrophic
Business assistance program
and the M. R. A.
process is while the states
that the state statutes
are they they
spell out what what is
needed they also
leave a lot of room for you
to do what
you need to do and
do it in a more efficient
manner than going
all out with the big planning
processes.
So with that I'm gonna turn it
over to Debbie
to kind of start
talking about how
the catastrophic Business
assistance program
began.
Thank you madam chair
members of the committee the
catastrophic Business
we started with a conversation
with senator Hamlin
about how we can help our
businesses with
catastrophic.
Incidences that
happened and
I think part of the
rollout was really
following COVID
and center have one and I
knew through our
respective connections here in our
community specifically
that there were a lot of needs
out there that we're
perhaps addressed through opera
funds but the funds were going
to be coming out
and we're really in
response to some of the
catastrophic things that we
faced in our
community I
E. it's been really
hot this summer and I know
there's been requests for air
conditioners going out in restaurants
of had to close so
I think in the conversation about
how we can help businesses
locally I
became one of those
conversations that center have
on and I had
to continue to have how
can we help these
small businesses and many
of them are mom and pops you all
have them in your community
when that air conditioner
dies and it's a restaurant
and you can't vote for customers
guess what.
You're down you're
losing money
so how can we
as legislature's and through
our local governments assisted
create programs I'm
very passionate about I'm
not saying we just start giving
to all the money that we have to have
a definitions we have to have
criterion but
anything we can help that mom
part right restaurant
particularly in Los
crucis to sell
a few more green chili
enchiladas are green chili
hamburgers it helps the
economy as a whole
I think one key that
are examined I constantly
talk about is the
power and influence
of small businesses that our
communities because
those are the heart of
America that's why I'm
so passionate also but as
we do see those
small businesses are the business
who'd who support our
little leagues to support our
soccer team to support our
band groups those are
the businesses who really
consistently give back
to our community so this
catastrophic funding
hopefully it will go
statewide I see
it as another huge tool
in the community in our
communities because it makes
a difference in how
the communities
respond and it
ultimately.
The end result of a business
growing in your community
unity as providing
jobs.
You know those sometimes a
small businesses are that first
higher that would have high
school student we just had a
very of
successful internship
program and Anjana County
and those small businesses are
the ones who step up
and they hire our
students in a long
term we can get their community are
committed to our community to stay
raise their own families thank
you madam chair committee
members.
So from there I got
a call from Senator Hamblen
when they add that
asked if you know
she had during the legislative
session yes
at
that you know she
said that she had junior money
and that Debbie
and her had this idea
to be able to give money
with a quick turnaround to
small businesses and
she had spoken to the number New Mexico
economic development department and they
believe using the local
economic development actively
to
that.
There would be a way to make this
happen and she wanted
to know if the city of
Los crucis would be interested
in using those
funds in implementing these
programs and then
at the very end she said by the way
you have one day to figure this
out because the money and
that information is due tomorrow
so I instantly
called W. secretary
only not that much of a jerk
to select
quick turnaround and it
just a quick side now
I'd been trying of because
I knew that Leda had added
retail I had been trying to find
a way to make
kind of this kind of program
in place so it kind it really
just gave me
the. The
ability to take the time
and create a pilot
program based on what we
already wanted to do
anyway. So I
wasn't upset
so I I
instantly called deputy
secretary John Clark
and the economic development
department he
walked me through how they could
pop how we could possibly do this
there are just so many questions
are how it fits into the
the in the lead up because
we only know Lita
as using
these funds to either recruit
business to help business expanded
bringing jobs and investment
so how can we create such
a smaller program with such a quick
turnaround and also
there is you know you
you have to have heard the state
statute has to have a positive
economic impact the business
has to put a security down there
has to be post performance
measures how can you do
this it was just there is
so much and then fortunately
W. secretary really helped
us walk through
it.
And I was able to call Senator him
back in Taylor yes we can do
this let's if you
can get us $150000
in junior money we can create this pilot
program so that's what we
did is we started creating the
program we updated our lead a
plan like
as Debbie said
that.
One of the biggest things
is by definition what is
catastrophic what
help what would make a
business qualify for something
like this and that the
definition of on page 18
and it's really
long but
a big part of it is
that I do want to read it says
at are these
incidents can lead to
significant operational
disruptions loss of
critical data and
financial losses and
this is what Debbie touched
on when she spoke
is if this if
it's an incident where a
business is going to have to shut
down or
they have to
even for a few hours
shut down
if it's something where
it's a restaurant and they have a
grill go out and so they can't
sell burgers for a few
days that has
a very negative impact
on the small businesses
so we felt like this
that is kind of the baseline
of where we're gonna start
with these kinds of funds
at then we created this
application process
one thing we learned in
during comment is that
while there is tons of funds out
there a lot lease but a lot of the
small businesses and I know Joanne
can touch on it.
They didn't even know how to get to the
applications because they were
pages and pages long they
need all this information so
we wanted to be able to have a short
process where we can
streamline the funds
and then the post
performance measures
we're going to be nice and
simple.
And so.
That the entire process
is it's we have an
initial application you get on the
city website you put in basic
information and
then it comes to us and
then we immediately reach
out to you and we send a full
application which is just 2
pages long and the
re what part of the reason we wanted
to do an initial application
and then a full application is because
we want to be there to help
you work through
the process be able to answer
questions for you instead
of you filling out a full
application sending it to
us we tell US we
need sending it again
you know that we were working with
you throughout the entire
process and another
aspect we wanted to do
because this is what normally is done in
the lead up process is a financial
review while
I would love to give money
to any business we need to make
sure that the business is viable
and that's when we brought in the
SPDC because
we felt like they were great partners
and they would be able to work while
we were working for that through
the full application
process they would be able
to work through the
financial review
for the business so that
when they were both
at the same time we could easily
give the funds
out.
So
I'm.
After that
Elisabeth and W. to
her I'm numb to
look deputy director Chris fair
because instead of take me
with the STTC and see how
we could partner and
help with with
districts with the leader
application on the financial
review
and
because it again it
falls into the mission
of developing skilled
entrepreneur skilled entrepreneurs and
strong businesses what we
found going back to
COVID and we were helping with
the idle and the PPP is
a lot of business owners
they did not have a good record keeping
system they did not even
know what the profit and loss
for the most part what a profit and loss statement
was so they would come
to us and we would
help
put that together and
and a lot of small business owners
what happens is they
they put a lot of a trust
on their accounts and their
bookkeepers and
we like to consult with them as a hate
you have to keep track of that to
you know what that's like the bottom
line of the business and
so when we
bring the client and
we actually 8 not only
do we go to the financial right
review but we're teaching them
what is a profit what are the
expenses and what is the
net what is your net
loss or the net profit and how do
you if need
be do we need to decrease expenses
how do we increase
revenue so
when we do a consulting
is not only for the the start up
of the business but it's also
growing and staying
in business and even all
the way that the succession planning
of the business and so
when they come on we not only
do the business planning
but it's
with with the
catastrophic
leader program
we want to set with a
client review
there the financial
projections and
as we're consulting with them as
we're talking with them then we find
out other things that's going on
because we we develop those
relationships
and it could be that
they didn't really look at their
lease agreements or they
don't really know that there was
insurance that they needed to get
and and so
what we're wanting to do is we want to
make sure not only that the business
state. It stays open
but that they continue
to have those jobs
and they create jobs and
so when we met
we determined that the best
thing to do was that
not only what they me with us
initially we would
continue to be with them
quarterly so that
we can make sure that those
jobs.
Not only state or but
they also
increased.
So.
Aside from just
advising the client
we also have resources that
we can help them with it that
has to do with their industry and where
they should be
and demographically
and how do they market
their business and
so.
We
are.
That's what we found that this was a great
partnership with them and so
with the ongoing support and
the assistance that they get from the
SBDC they
can you know continue to stay
in
business.
So after they get through
the application process
and the finance review they start
working with SPDC there's
either either approved or
denied and the
way that this program has kind of
worked itself out that even if
they're not denied funds are still
going to have that relationship with the
SPDC they're still
going to be able to to work with
them and maybe find other funding
sources find other avenues
for the to to help their
business in the time I cap
catastrophic
need.
Yeah and I and I wanted to add
that the STTC does
not deny or approve the
the application of what we're
doing is we're providing the
support and we're helping them
to understand where their financials
goes the the city
of Los crucis approves or
denies application however
they continue with the long term
relationship with the
SPDC
and we help
with the loan if they need to get along
with helping with the loan packaging
and and so
forth.
So when when they are
approved the funds
are distributed immediately
and then for the post performance
we have a 6 month review
an annual review and the way we
set it up is
that a year
from the date they receive
the funds they have to have 2
things they have to be
operational and
if not like if it's
catastrophic think we had
a a brewery burned out like
have a huge fire
about 6 months ago or so
so you know a year
from now being open might not be
realistic but for the
most part we want to business the
operational and have the same at
least the same number of
employees
that they had
before the incident
happened and
when you look at the economic
impact the way that we
justify it is
if we weren't able to give these
funds it would have
had such a negative
economic impact to our
community so just by providing
5 to $10000
to help them out an immediate
need we're helping them
to at least get the ball rolling
to help them get back
on their feet get the business opening
so that's a positive economic
impact
so that's you know that the
basics of the process they have a
pre app application
application financial
review they get the funds
and then we check in periodically
with them this
program went into effect on
July 1 we have
had 20
and national applications
a 6 of them have been
completed with the
have completed the full application
and have been referred to the
SPDC and
what we're seeing what we think
of catastrophic as big
incidents like a
brewery catching
fire what we're seeing like
Debbie said is AC
replacements you know we just had the
hottest summer and
history so it's
we're seeing a lot of AC's
going out so they need these kinds
of funds
vandalism this that
this pairs really well with our store
front repair program water
damage.
Leisure due to water line repairs
there is one specific
application I remember
that it was out
water line repairs and
the business had to close down
for it was a restaurant
for 2 days so they had
lost
so employees lost salaries
they had it's
a bakery so they
had orders they had to
cancel because they
couldn't they
couldn't make so cakes
and pastries or
not and then
and just so what the loss of
revenue from not being opened
so that adds up real
fast for just being closed
for just a few days
so that's kind of we're already
seeing
success like 20
applications in just a few
months is is big
for our big for the program
and you know that
$50000
is going to go
a long way in this
community.
And so like
Senator Hamad said
this is we want to start this as a
pilot program
and but with statewide
implementation.
Yes and so thank you
for this and and I know that we've
got some some other
questions
that the so if you will and
look around and then we'll take this call
I I continue to to
springboard off of what Elizabeth was
saying is that
really what we're looking
at here is collaboration
which we also talked about
yesterday in our committee meeting and
how important it is for this
collaboration
you know I step out of that process
of of selecting we leave it up to the
Economic Development Department but
where I see this
as a statewide
opportunity
and that's what Joanne I'm glad that
you're here because not
every community especially our
rural communities have economic
development departments
so what we have to
look at is how
they get access to those leader
funds because that's
the the channel that they will go
through and knowing
that this is been vetted
that this is not violating anti
donation that this is really
providing that quick
turnaround assistance
that could shut a business down
for 2 days or shut them down for 2
weeks and
so we're looking at
this as just
really that that assistance that
many of us who I have the small
communities know
that you know if
they they can
try and apply for loans but
that's at least a week
out.
That they
maybe you know they'll be able to
use their insurance money but
like in the case of the brewery that
we're talking about what we
could've done is help them with their premium
so that they can get moving on the
insurance quicker
but you know I just found out that
the the this brewery that we're
talking about just got their insurance
check 2 weeks
ago.
Unfortunately this program could be
retroactive and help them but they
were really what inspired
this idea of what
happens when a business experiences
a catastrophe
so at
this point I'd like
to leave it open for questions I know that
we've got some folks want who
have questions
and also that I
would like to
you know offer up
the the services of
of these incredible
women who are here on the panel
because we
recognize that there are
communities that are
struggling with these in
may need assistance or guidance
on how to implement
programs like this
and and I'm really proud
and an honor to work with
them to to be able to come up
with ways that are really
addressing the needs because we can
come up with all the ideas we want as
legislators on what we think are going to help
small businesses.
But we need to ask small businesses
what are going to really help them
and so being able to navigate
that and work with these folks
to be able to do that I think is
really critical so
I have Senator Griggs
Representative Garrett representative
Armstrong Representative Roybal
Caballero I don't know if there's
anybody else if you want to
shout out your name otherwise
you can either text
the vice chair
and we'll get your your name on there
but senator grace here welcome to
the first. Thank
you madam chair and you know economic
development is is something
that's very critical and
small communities we've worked on
that in Alamogordo for
seems like forever
couple things though I
wanted to ask is
does Los crucis
is Los crucis have
or have the imposed
the any increments of the
local economic development
tax.
Madam chair Senator
Griggs you with the
local economic development act
yes the actual taxes
we have the ability to in
public we have not
can madam madam chair 20
the things it.
Was really concerning
when we
passed Senate bill 19
which was Senator Woods
bill a few
years back to allow
for
help to retail
businesses because
retail businesses from a
state perspective
and from a local perspective
to your picking winners and
losers you're actually
picking somebody
over somebody else in
most cases
but what that bill did was
it bill said that if you've
imposed the tax
you can utilize the
tax that you
impose for
that for that short of
help and I
think that that's something that you'll
need to to look
at and see how
you might be able to
consider using
using that
particular
thing
one other one other deal
that I wanted to mention to
others to others one of
which was Senate bill
11 that we should.
Which passed a
awhile back as well during the
special session and
that's for for really big
projects but
that's the the bill that
allows for gross
receipts tax that
basically half of the gross receipts
tax to be waived
as that if you get you
got invests like
$350000000
in the in the project
show it just
Mr for big deal but could
be could be something down
here that would do that
then one of the things it
is far as restaurants
go and and
Debbie mention restaurant
is the
challenges been for
years and years on
the ability of a small
restaurant to
purchase an affordable
liquor license.
And that changed a
few years ago we sent a bill
to our house bill
255
and that allows for the
purchase of a
restaurant a
restaurant to purchase a
license for
beer wine and spirits
cost $10000 to
purchase that
and it's renewed it
$10000
sure that may be something that
the legislature wants to
think about is
that renewal fee
for that
particular
type of of
libations whichever
range a a small
restaurant.
Then we'll pick one right
here because there's one right
over here called not believe
it was but if if
Napoli does wanted to
shale of
margaritas and
tequila sunrises
up there.
Then they can purchase that
license which would allow that
to happen
job to them
up to them but I think
for restaurants
and in a community like
this
that has
the lot of them
that's an opportunity
that you know if we're not taking
advantage of oil maybe
maybe were mission it
but I think I think
it would be smart for the
legislature to look at
that renewal fee
to see if each to hire
not
sure I just wanted to mention
those things
because they
can help you
as you try to move forward
in in your endeavors
with the businesses are trying to
help so thank you madam
chair.
Thank you W. wanted to
respond to that I did thank you
senator Senator
Griggs.
I was sitting here listening to use
talking and it's the very
reason why you
all know me well enough to
know that I'm very
pro collaboration
I'm very pro cooperation
and communication within your
communities many of
you don't think you
have a chamber but you have a
business voice
you may not have an economic
development but you also
Pasila take
discussions
and the 1 thing I've noticed my
first session that I was
that the Santa Fe was
1990 yes I'm that
old I will was
that over the years
the communication
regarding small business
and how the legislation
legislature can
really dive
deep into the communication
of how can we help
the businesses within our
communities and
you just throughout 23
pools the toolbox Senator
Griggs that I
encourage you as you go
into a budget session
to committee to continue
that level of communication
with us is chambers with
us the city levels
and I worked with during the
COVID I met with all your
chambers twice a
week versus a
so I know you're communities
intimately of more
than I ever thought I would with
COVID and that
key is communication
and then together
legislature's both house
where in the house and
Senate you all
can work in create
the toolbox even
stronger to help
our businesses survive thank
you senator thank you Debbie
and and 1 of the things that like to add
to this is that
you know I think all of us to kind of agree
that there are many programs that the
Economic Development Department offers that
we don't know about.
And you know
we continue to talk
about how I mean
at the state level
but also we look at
this opportunities as
both of you Joanne and Liz
and talked about is
that even if a business
does not qualify for this
fund they're still
getting connected with the resources
because we we've recognize
that also in Los crucis
as that there are these different
programs that businesses have
no idea what what are
available for them so
ultimately not only
does it you know that what we're
talking about is the the
catastrophic Business relief fund
but we're also looking at
that we need to
develop a stronger work you
know stronger small business
community
and you know many of them are busy
just trying to keep their businesses open they
don't have time to explore
and so we we are
looking at this as an opportunity
of opening that door to create
not only relationships but also
knowledge about the programs that are
offered at the city and then
they therefore share about also
what's available at the state
and so but we know that
that doesn't happen everywhere
and we know that we need
to do better and that's why we
constantly encourage partnership
with chambers Economic
Development Department small business
development centers
to help do that because
especially I I want to give Joanna
shut out because during the pandemic
when all of us were meeting virtually
every 2 weeks to find
out what we could do the
small business development center every
single small business development center
around the state
shouldered
the challenges of our small
businesses and getting them their PPP
loans and so I
want to commend you and the whole entire
department at the state level
because they were
working all the time
to make sure that they had emails
that they were using quickbooks that
all of their documents were in a
row so that they could qualify
for that funding so thank you
joined.
So Representative
Garrett.
Thank you madam chair and
thank you that point about
not knowing about things
every time I come to this committee
and one reason I come to this committee
is because I learned about stuff
that I never knew which
brings me to my question math
madam chair around
the state establishing
broadband is a big issue
and the anti donation
clause often comes up in
jail they had
to turn circles
around because
of the whole anti donation
clause so so my
question then
is.
Can broadband be part
of that as I read
it
it's for blighted areas but it's
also for economics
so a community that's
revitalizing in
a region
can they use
of money that they
collect through the establishment
the metropolitan redevelopment
area for
broadband.
Madam chair representative
Garrett. That's
an interesting question
and as it aligns with
especially anti
donation and
I think through my experience
within the state
I broadband has been
an issue that we I've
discussed in everyone of my
roles as president
Executive Director in
Rio Rancho I thought we were real
close around 2009
and it didn't work out we're
still struggling for I'm
not real sure the in what this
particular of bills
provided would cover
that however I'm
gonna throw this out there I think we
all need to have that long discussion
about I am anti
donation
businesses are changing
the culture businesses a
changing things are
happening very quickly
overall Representative
Garrett with the things that we
learned of
madam chairman Senator
Hamblen during the
COVID to
do this we do cease
point we were
part of the county distribution
of our funds many many
rural businesses
did not have quick books
they didn't they weren't they were all then
what we would get tons of
paper so
that broadband
is very very important
not only in economic development but
also health related things
etcetera etcetera
so up I
would be open for the discussion
I think I would speak for
Senator Hamblen ever of the
giggles particularly because we
have a challenge here we all
do within the state with
broadband and I think
bottom line is
Representative Garrett to help
our businesses grow
and reach that level of
sustainability that's
got to be a priority in there's
got to be a
statewide broadband
access thank
you thank you
and and one more
question
madam chair.
The I've been working
on a public private
partnership
bill bipartisan
bill and various ones have been
working on this for years
and we're working on it again and as I
go into it
it's like you Sir discovering there's
all these mechanisms for public
private partnerships that nobody
talks about I mean
this one just popped up for me
because that's what I have my
eyes on so that
was interesting to learn
from your presentation
thank you for the very helpful
handouts
that's. Thank
you Representative Garrett representative
Armstrong and then Representative
Roybal Caballero.
Thank you madam chair and thank you for
the
presentation.
I just need to
let people know that
you know in rural New
Mexico I represents
the largest house district
in the state.
And we've had a real
issue across the
state with
being having our
economic development
entities
certified by the
state
last year that
certification are they
applied for it
and didn't not a single
rural New Mexico
economic development department
received certification
was all urban.
So they applied again this
year and this is
on the middle Rio Grande economic
development association
there that represents a
coral Sierra Valencia
and capturing.
We're doing a tremendous job in
our area but they're not
I believe the word is certified
through the state.
And I
helped start that what by
giving some capital
outlay money we had to do
it through New Mexico
tech
and they
just fight to keep their head above
water all the
time. And
other doing great things in our in
our area but
that's one problem
is what they have to
be a certified
economic
development.
Madam chair representative
Armstrong so at
the this
certification through the net New
Mexico economic development department
is through the
the ATO's the economic
development organizations
if that is the only
economic development
organization within your
region they could
potentially implement these
programs you through
their municipalities but they do
not have to be certified EDS
that's a separate program
okay thank you for that because
it's an issue to get certified
in rural New Mexico
so that would be one question my next
question in in
Magdalene a
where I'm from of the
last.
All 3 or 4 months we've had
to catastrophes
one of I'm building a
new business owner came
in guns blazing
everything was great
did all the right
things got
her beer and wine license
in our little restaurant
and we
have no restaurants
in the in Magdalena except
for that has any
kind of opening except for
her and then she
would that was diagnosed with
the. Horrible
disease.
What that.
Be something that
would.
Qualify would
be my next because she
was unable to run her
business you know she
needed help
they stopped being open
7 days a week or 6 days
a week just to weakens
so I was.
Catastrophic to
her
so that was one question my next
question is
the electricity went out for
3 days in
Magdalena.
My husband and I brought in
generators.
To keep the village Water
going so the people in the
village actually had
water to their homes
and we took on to our gas
station that we on there so the people
people to buy gas for their
generators.
And be able to get by
and so on and so forth so what
that qualify
as a catastrophe
those are my
2.
Madam chair and
Representative Armstrong what
I really like about this program
is that it is a pilot program
at what we do have a definition
in place you
it's it's
very broad for a reason
so it's really up to
you know when it
when it's implemented at
the state level I can
see both the
situations being
considered catastrophic
because it is
it's impacting having a negative
impact on the business
now there would of course as
part of the the process the
application process with
these funds as we are
working with and we're trying to
figure out you know
if they do
have. Lands
for re opening if they're going to
be closed are going.
Stacked 7 days a week
consider weekends so that would
have to be part of the process it
would have to be working with these
business owners and figuring out
exactly.
How this would work what how the funds
could be used to know how
we can get to help you get back
on your feet a
so I believe
that I personally
see these both of those situations
as catastrophic but
but that's again that's what's nice about
it being a pilot program is that
we are we're seeing
these we're not seeing
these big incidents
fortunately we're seeing
these smaller.
Smaller incidents that we
don't we we never
thought of when planning all this
out and it's it's just helping
us learn and helping us
see other ways we can help
businesses thank
you for those answers I was just
curious because I think
I think madam chair that that's going to be
the situation is
where where
where are the rails of the
definition and
there's going to be things that pop
up
that.
That we're just gonna have questions about
so you know northern New Mexico during
the fires you know
things like that
so
and when we don't want to
to necessarily
double dip into
emergency type
situations but we also
want to
help
businesses and so I
I and right now
I really like this
idea.
I just want to make
sure.
That all of New
Mexico could access
this through the small business
development.
Centers we can do that
on their own all across New
Mexico but a
lot of businesses don't know
about on yeah it's exactly
what Representative Garrett said you
know there we learn all the
time all the things I wish we had
like a checklist
of L. business
that's the only tab
talking about that you know
that's tab media we need to
look at with something
else it's tab see
because everything it's
it's a big hairy monster
and navigating it
is is also a little
bit scary to me and
then I just want to
bring home the point
about
if if this goes through
it needs to be
language in their needs to make
sure that we
have
if ours gets cert
cert economic
development and we're really
happy but if they're not
certified through
the economic development department I
want to make sure that we can still
access that because
in rural New Mexico we we don't
have that well I think it's
it's if I may and I don't
W. wanted to respond to
that it's if
there if the agency
is able to administer Leda funds
than the certification is is
relevant that
it's really that that that
is the Avenue it which
this is going under
and so
not going under is in like failing
but falling
under
and so I I think that
that's that's not
really the the main
I mean I understand your concern about
it because especially if it's so frustrating
for rural areas but
regarding the ministry in this
fund or these monies that's
not that's not going to be an
impediment to
that
the other thing is is that I think
it's what's really critical
about this when we think about this at the state
level is and that we're seeing
here is that it is opening
up those opportunities for businesses
to get connected with other programs
I don't want to double dipping either
I want to make sure that we're making the
most use of that money
and cell as listed talked
about that there are other
programs that are available
and so it's really kind of this
okay this doesn't work for you but
we've got this this and this they
can.
W. wanted to go ahead respond thank you
Representative.
Thank you madam chair representative
Armstrong I think
a real key
if this does come
before the legislature
regarding the catastrophic
funding the next couple
years I think
one of the things meet you'll see
many programs of the state are
familiar with where is that there's
the state R. one
criterion here
but local
municipalities commit
and county commissions
have the ability
to tweak that for their
culture you know in a
I just you all heard you
know I've been north south and now south
again in New Mexico well
every business no matter
where you are they face the same
issues every
culture is different
in our community so I think
part of what would make this
program successful
statewide is this
you have this higher level
of state but you give
the communities
the ability
to structure
this program to what you see
is needs and the king
constant change
of what what's happening in that
community and I think that's the
beauty of the success that could
happen out of this I think we've worked
really hard to make
sure that it's addressing
things that we're facing
in Los crucis
but to be honest I'm not sure how
it will affect the gets to done
in the county those issues
may be different and I think that's
the beauty of this and I just
can't I've been on the SPDC
advisory committee
for 25 years
I think sometimes.
I will send Senator could
have won a list of all
all of our directors
and listing it is a
wonderful tool within your
communities you may not have
direct access but trust
me I'm available
Duan's billable were
available statewide
they are a true key
to success in your communities to
businesses thank you madam
chair thank you for
that you know the
closest one and
where from where I live we
need to be Los Lunas or
Silvercity.
That's all but the big distance
between those 2
so I but
all I agree they do great
things and thank you all for your
presentation and
and
Senator Hamblen for the brain
child thank you.
Thank you lose you want to address also
yes since we
have received some of these applications
you know just to give an example
no this isn't directly from an
application but it's
really easy when
when you see like
AC 1 out we
were close for 3 days
you know this is the impact that
had but there's also
been an
an application or 2 that has
been you know
businesses restaurants
or something listing their equipment
that's old and then
you know it's 1015 years
old and then if it goes out for
a day they can
you know their grill doesn't work that's
different to me that's
not catastrophic because
that's not something that
you weren't planning
for that completely shuts
down impacts operation
so we have had already have
those tough conversations of
you know does this really fit in with
these these funds is just
what the you know we only have
$150000
you know we got to figure
out where they need to go but
when in those instances where you
do have old equipment that obviously
needs to replace it
again SPDC
that's where they can really start to help
out help these businesses
so yes well rounded
approach to making
sure the businesses get the help
that they need thank
you for that are the 1 last
little thing that I'll just make a
statement on is
you know the state
Albuquerque in Los
crucis.
Are they going to use all of the
funds before
rural New Mexico has
access because you look
at Albuquerque for
instance and the
crime in Albuquerque
and businesses closing down every
day because they're tired of paying
$50000 to
replace their glass that got
broken
weekly
different things like that
so.
Our company actually
someone shut it up in a
R. 15 the middle of the
night.
So that that would be my other
concern is how.
Equitable would it be
across the
whole state and that's
completely legitimate representative
because we don't you know
with we don't want our rural
communities to get the
short end of the
stick
and so that's something that I
want to have that conversation is
that if that money is implemented
at the state level we need to allocate
that money for the regions
you know I mean yeah
and I think about that I think
6 applications I don't know about
the 20 so that's
been a lot since our last
communication about
this and
so that and we're just getting out
I've seen the advertisements for this
program all over social
media which I commend you
for but I
I do that is a concern for
me because I don't want those rural
communities to get the
shorthand or I'm just
appreciate all the time so
I have more colorful ways
of saying that but I'm not doing
that
so but I I do think that
that's something that we
certainly need to to address
and and make sure that we're very
cognisant of
thank you madam chair thank you
all.
Representative Roybal
Caballero.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you of all of you for
your presentation to
it's very exciting have
sometimes when I listen to these
presentations and I come to this
committee I regret having
retired even though
I'm.
Glad I retired so I could
serve of
but as a community economic
developer it's given me a lot
of pride to hear
the positive report
so on and
how we are expanding
and growing and
redeveloping
redeveloping is
is the key word
I think today in Seoul on
from the standpoint of.
The M. R. a high I
just want to
and also I love being in Los
crucis because this is my home
town my home base
and when you talked about
it by sales also aligned
with potential
these are all areas that
I grew up in Plano around
this in those
days you could play in
the streets in an open
neighborhoods
and
just have a great sense
of of community and I
I remember
one grandmother taking me to
the old style
the pharmacy with a
soda
fountain
and then as a grandmother
taking me other places to
the old Phillis crucis
first Los crucis shopping
center and mall
and eating at Luby's and
someone you know those all
those experiences so this
report brought all that back
and and then I
also what madam chair I want to
acknowledge that you know
might my
maternal grandfather
was the first and
only on the tailor
shop in Los
crucis back in the twenties
and had an early death
so he died at
53
so.
The tailor shop closed at
that point
but so
I have very vivid memories
and I've seen first
hand and
personally
how we have
House let's crucis is
grown and expanded
but I've also seen
on the many different
directions and pitfalls
that have occurred and
that's because some
setbacks
and so that's why your
report today is so very
important because
you've acknowledge
that madam chair
through
all of the work that you're doing so
I just wanted to say
that.
Currently I
have family owned
businesses on cell phone
video and
other historically
designated
areas so my
question has to
do
with.
How.
Is a historically
designated
neighborhood or
area.
An obstruction or
an impediment to
what.
MRA is looking
at and how does neighborhood
revitalization
work into
the overall plans
because I know the city's
and counties and local
governments
a component of economic
developments neighborhood
revitalization so if you could
just address that
please.
Harry madam chair and
representative so I
I believe that
our historic districts
can really help
with the M. R.
especially during the planning
process one
of our potential
areas that we're looking at
is in our historic district
and we do have
specific.
Codes in place for historic
district so that
just it's
it can
really.
Add on to the plan
but it has to be part of the planning
process I would I would say
is because you have
to from the beginning you have to set
those standards and people have
to know that in whether it's the
entire the MRE is a
historic district are just part
of it they have to know
that this has
these guidelines are expected to be
followed even
in an MRI it doesn't
matter you
know. Whether
it's.
It just it doesn't matter
whether the historic district is there
not like it's it's
and we're fortunate in Los
crucis at our historic
district is is very vibrant
and we have a very
active community
so when we did the and
when we did the the
process to
designate they were
there and they made sure that
they they were hurt because
they that was their concern to
you know they've spent we
spent years making sure that we
have a nice
historic area and then we have
a potential new area coming in
that could change that so
it's just I would that would just be my
one recommendation make sure it's
in the planning process
so madam chair and thank you for
that I know that
at the the jerky
and more property on
south some BIZZARRO that
became it a huge issue
because that that
whole corridor on my
lotus how some visit
all that that little corridor
has been historically
designated my grant
paternal grandfather
grew up and had his
historical home and that
his his
home is in that cell cell
bill of the of
corridor and
they're now having another issue
on the other side of cell cell
BIZZARRO
and and so I just needed
to understand so
I I did advise them
about the planning process
and being involved in that
but I also am concerned
and make sure want to
make sure that all
of the application processes
and the application
forms
correctly address or
direct individuals
to the proper
city the
county
offices administrations
whatever they have to go through
a checklist would be
fantastic
they they come to me
because I wear that
economic developer planner
here at
as my former professor
of my retired
profession and
so it I've gone through
some of the paperwork and so I
just want to make sure that
it's correlated
well on from the. And and and
then finally madam
chair I wanted to kind
of address the
outreach.
Question that everyone's
talked about and that
is that you
know we we all do town
halls.
And a great way to
offer information in our town
halls is to invite
you enlighten come
all of the different programs
that are going on in our
communities to
also present Sen
that gives us as
elected
an increased
opportunity
to talk about
our programs and how
individuals can
tap into them as
needed because we
get we get we've been
getting really good
attendance at all of our town
halls of 34
times a year that we conduct
those so that's another
great way so
thank you for again for all the
work that you're doing
and.
Madam chair thank you for
highlighting the legislation
in our community thank you very
much Representative I appreciate
that I do appreciate
the the feedback and and
the enthusiasm about
this and I know that I've talked with Senator
Diamond and representative
Armstrong and Senator Griggs is
also provided some
some guidance so I
I do want to
bring this up to the committee to
support and and I would love
your your guidance on what's
the best approach for this
because it may not necessarily be a bill
you talked about maybe putting it in
the budget
but we'll work on that because I think
this is the time for
us as we're talking about we had
this conversation even beforehand
is that at the state level all of us are
talking about when we come when it
comes down to the windfall that we're
experiencing
that we want to make sure that everything is
sustainable that we're not wasting
money that we're not just thrown it down
the toilet and that this
is investing in people's
long term so we want to
be really thoughtful about that and what
will make the biggest impact
up for in this case
are businesses so I appreciate
the feedback and and
ways that the 2 of you especially
given what committees you sit
on where we can
go with that so thank
you I appreciate
you and it's always lovely
to see all people
I get to work with come
in and talk so thank
you very much appreciate
that we're only
26 minutes behind schedule
so I appreciate that we we
usually like 30 minutes so
I do try to keep this less than
that
so next we have
we are going to you know trying to
for roughly
1245
lunch the rest
of our day is public banking
types and impacts of
Ted's but
we've got our growing New Mexico's film
industry we have amber Dobson who is
the director of the New Mexico film
office
and then we also have a change
reviews and economist with the New
Mexico film office
so we're looking forward to
hearing that
presentation
they're walking in right now
okay.
Like a big entrance like
a red carpet and
from. We're gonna have
like Jennifer we having spotlights
Senator Steinborn we're gonna have like
spotlights in red
carpet.
And so we are
grateful for that you have
a if you want to take a moment to go ahead
and and do a bathroom break or
drink break while we're we're getting set
up that's
great.
And
so yeah I'm speechless which
is remarkable.
I'm lost for
words.
Yes.
Representative Armstrong says this is the
funniest Committee so who maybe
just because of the faux pas I make all
the time.
Or
are you.
Good good to see
you.
You ready to go.
All right.
So we have amber Dotson who
is the director of the Mexico Film Office
change roof was an economist with
the New Mexico film
office
you know we I I
I wanna Senator Steinborn talk
about how we
want to highlight Southern New
Mexico because
we're doing a lot of amazing stuff
down here and I'm grateful
for that
you know and I think this is one of the
one of the components the additional
components we talk about diversifying
our revenue stream
is looking at all of these different
things and I think the film industry has
demonstrated that it is something
that is a viable revenue
streams
although we I think we try to
look at everything but we're very grateful
for this viable revenue streams
and also I don't know if you all play but
I have like little bingo card of like
whenever I watch something that has been filmed
in New Mexico it's like whether or not I
was like oh I've been there all
I know that building so
I think that's kind of like a New Mexico
true campaign just let's now
like you know movie
movie at movie
bingo.
So I'm gonna turn it over to you to
go ahead and talk and so thank you very much for
being here we appreciate you making travel
down I always like
to show people how long we have to drive
down in southern New Mexico driving up
so I appreciate you doing
that thank
you.
The talking person there we go
thank you so much chair
hello members of the committee
we are really pleased to be here today
thank you for inviting us
down we are always happy
to talk about this incredible
industry in New
Mexico
in front of actually
it to my side is change
refer con mist
my name's amber Dodson director of the New
Mexico film office
and we'll just dive right into the
presentation we have a lot of
data good to go through and some
great
updates.
First off on for those of
you who just might be more
New to economic
development I thought I'd run through
what the New Mexico film office
actually is what we have actually
do we are a division
of the economic development
department and our
mission is to grow the film
television and digital media
industry of New Mexico
create jobs for New
Mexicans manage
the film incentive program
market New Mexico as
a premier content
creation hub
and we also manage workforce
development programs were
staff of 7
we're lean but
mighty
the the the tax
credit I want to give an overview there
to there been some recent
updates thank you to the
legislature
it just affected
this July one twenty
twenty three
it we offered a 1
of the most competitive
and I think smart film
tax credits in the in
the nation and if not the
world at
25 percent refundable
tax credit that is the
base
and we also have
various up lists of 5
percent uplifts for
either a qualifying television
series or
a production utilizing
qualified production
facilities.
There's also things to the
legislature the
8 what was once a
5 percent uplift is now a
10 percent uplift
for production in the up
with his own the
uplift zone is what's the
you might hear with the rules
own but we're calling it the up with
his own and not up with
zone is
60 miles from
the count or from the city
halls of Albuquerque and Santa
Fe so production
shooting outside of that
corridor
have an extra
incentive
to be able to bring production
statewide to every corner of the
state I'm
also with our tax
credit why I think it is one of the
most smart and strategic
film tax credits
is this rebate
is based on New Mexico
spend there are
other territories that
offer greater
percentages less
percentages ours
is right in the middle
and ours is based on productions
hiring New Mexican
residents and sourcing
from New Mexico businesses
and that is what really sets
our film tax credit
part from
areas like Georgia
so we
love that that is
working its has proven
to be working we have
this incredible workforce as a
result of it and I'll get into that
more in a moment.
I'm I just wanted to highlight
also on the slide that the base credit
is 25 percent
right but the average
credit we actually issue
is 19
percent
so you know
it might be alarming
to think it's 25 up to
35 percent
actually the the at the
end of the day were issue
more like a 19 percent credit
so for every dollar
invested
in New Mexico in
through this industry
it's $0.19
that is given back in rebate
credit.
The next page is a brilliant
piece of our legislation
that came into effect
several years ago with
the governor this
is our film partners
program and this
program has already been
copied.
By areas like New Jersey
and other territories that want to be
competitive they have
seen that
having New Mexico Film
partners companies that make
long term 10 year
investments in the state
building
soundstages
either leasing or buying investing
in capital infrastructure
committing to jobs and
committing to the very
significant production spend
numbers that model has
working we have as you
all know Netflix here
on NBC universal
and 8 to 8 productions
now right here in Los
crucis
all of those deals had
anything from
a commitment of.
US 70 $5000000
which is 828 up to
$2000000000 for
Netflix over 10 years
and really having these
companies here on the
ground for the long
term has transformed
New Mexico into
a production hub
rather than just a filming
location where you just come
and shoot your western
and you leave this is where
we make content now
from concept to completion
and that is our goal that is our mission
and that's the road we're
on
other pieces of the film
tax credit
just affected this
fiscal year the tax
credit payout
cap is 120000000
and twenty million and that
will gradually
scale 10000000 each
fiscal year
to 160000000
in FY 28 it will
remain at that cap
there after
we previously had a cap
of 200000000
and with the growth in the
momentum of this industry
we did need to look at
raising that cap this past session
so this is a very conservative
strategic way to
gradually increase that
payout cap and not
put brakes on this industry
for New Mexico
resident principal performers
this is also new
are now exempt.
From a credit cap
for production that existed
this piece I know it sounds sort
of boring and weird but it's
quite important because this
actually helps
productions
at give them an
extra nudge to cast here in
New Mexico for leading
roles they're not going
to have that specific little
cap for principal
performers that are residents
there is a cap on non
residents
also the N. R. C.
E. program the third bullet
non resident creating exception
program this is a program that's
been in place for a
while as
of July one we did
just scale that back a little
bit it used to be a
scalable 15 to
20 percent
and of non
certain non resident crew
you get a credit and it actually
the formula came out to more like a
2 percent credit was a 15
of 15 in this
equation
but now it it's not
a 15 to 20 it's now just
a 15 percent and we
that program will
be
slowly phased out as our crew
continues to
build.
Our New Mexico film partners
an update they have an
A. T. O. above the
line
piece of the legislation
that will really help
the Netflix's in the
NBCUniversal specifically
bring a really high budget
series here that can
be on the ground for
years an
employee hundreds and
thousands of people
TV series
typically spend more they
spend more money they
use and newer
technology and
production
techniques and methods
and they hire so many
people for years to come
they and they return season
after season so
this above the line
piece of the new legislation
really helps not flicks and
then we see continue to bring
more major spending
series here
they are still carved out
of the cap the
partners.
Here's a slide
number 6 showing
the estimated future
tax credit
payouts from FY 24
to FY 28
the darker blue bar
is non partners
and the lighter blue bar
is film partner
estimated payouts
in
millions.
The next slide is the average
tax credit issued already touched
on this but again our base credits
25 percent but we're seeing
the actual tax credit
that is issued
is more like 19
percent.
Here's some recent productions
which maybe all of you have
seen on TV
we've we've recently had
Netflix's stranger things
red ball AMC's
better call Saul
the incredible series dark wins
on AMC
Amazon's outer range
seasons 1 and 2
Oppenheimer of course
of fox's the cleaning
lady seasons 1 and
2 also
dark wins a season 1 and
2 so we've had a lot
of success in recent years
with these
projects that
some of which New Mexico
is a character
some of which read
pollen looking at specifically
written and directed
by Sydney Freeland who grew
up in New Mexico on the Navajo
Nation shut
it in New Mexico
distributed by Netflix
our phone partner I love
that example of
really it that's a testament
to the ecosystem we're really trying
to build is our content
creator and writer
is New Mexican and
up to and
indigenous
and you know go through the whole production
process and at the end of the day Netflix
distributed to the world
so we've had a lot
of
success without also dark
wins a lot of production
happen on the Navajo Nation there
they were based it to suit gay
Pueblo
they love to New Mexico Chris
air was a big
part of that series New
Mexican so
I wanted to highlight those there's many
more but we just picked some
ones you might recognize off the
top of your head. The
next slide a number 9
production spend in New
Mexico this is over the
past 4 years
obviously FY 20 was
COVID impacted
we came out of FY 21
breaking records we had never
seen that production spend
before 626
last of fiscal year
22 we had
855000000
and we were absolutely on
track my con in this contest
of. To break that
record again however
the strikes did come into
play and I will touch on that in
a moment but we had
a resounding we
successful here
this this FY 23
and we're already excited
about this next fiscal
year we have a bunch
of things in the pipeline and also
productions that were already
charging and they're just on
hold and I'll be ready to just pick
right up flip the switch
when the strikes are
resolved.
Here's just a large larger
longer range
showing production spend is
starting in FY
3 and you can just
see the trend there it's
been you know the ups and
downs but overall we
this industry
growing
so on the strike
certainly production
is impacted
it is a hard time for a lot of
our crew right now
that being said it's not
not everything is an act
we do have 9 projects
right now happening
on things like commercials
short films music
videos in post
production
and also we're confident that
once the negotiations
are resolved among the
parties.
The beautiful thing about production is
it's very nimble
and
mobile and it can
quickly with
the flip of a switch
come back and rebound
we already saw that happen
with COVID of
production was shut down for 6
months in
2020
the minute we opened production in
March of
2020 we
had a record breaking
year so I wanted to
note that we're
only 2
months in the writers strike
and you know
I'm not going to speak on behalf of any of the
parties but it
looks like these things will be
resolved fairly
soon what
I'm hearing is definitely
by
fall before the end of the
year the end of the calendar year
so we will see no 1 can know for
sure but things are
progressing.
Okay that's everything on that
side the next slide
number 11
this is I think the slides
interesting because here we have our
number productions over the
past
FY 20 through FY
23 fiscal
years but the second side
is showing the average New Mexico
budget and this
is exciting
to us because
this budget our New Mexico
budgets are increasing
FY 20 through the average is
19.6
8000000
New Mexico budget
and not means
9.6 8000000
that was spent here that wouldn't be here
otherwise per
production on average
in just fiscal year 23
larger budgets as I mentioned
before tend to
pay better wages
use better technology help
advance our crew base
utilize more businesses
and usually it's a
longer production so
people are working on a a
longer project
so that trend is exciting
that's also just sort
of the trend of the
industry
TV is certainly
king really
high budget high production
quality series are what
people want and there's a lot
of money being put into those
for all the streamers as I'm sure you
all now.
Here's a slide
on page 12 production
outside of Albuquerque and
Santa Fe we're gonna talk about this
for several sites because we
are so happy to be here in Los
crucis our seats
if it's there's a lot
of I need rebel slide
on Los crucis here in a bit
but obviously a
burgeoning exciting
film hot spot in New Mexico
and in the nation
here's some of the counties and
we just picked because we
couldn't fit them all but
some highlights
of.
Projects that image shot in each of
these counties outside of Albuquerque and
Santa Fe
you know some are Indies
some are major budget
pictures and we
continue to
see major interest
especially with the announcement of this
new 10 percent uplift for
the up with sewn in
scouting
statewide
that
that extra uplift helps
offset costs for
productions to
bring in creating to really
rural areas that might not have
a crew base
to pay for
extra housing if there's not enough
hotel rooms to offset
the cost to move a
unit
into rural area that 10
percent uplift is going to
unlock a
lot of
a business and potential
and and
production spend 4
areas statewide and
so we were in a
strike but we're
excited to see what happens we're
very confident that we'll see a lot of
growth continued growth in the up
with some as
I mentioned the border of the uploads
of up with stone has recently
changed it used to not
be as inclusive of
all all of this area so
everything you see on this map
in green is what
is.
Of the up with
some that
green area used to be
small a small
yeah a smaller
so there are a
lot of rural areas that
were not included with the previous
boundary the old boundaries
60 miles from the county
lines of Albuquerque and
Santa Fe and now it's 60 miles
from the city halls of Albuquerque
and Santa Fe and
that's that
yeah it's it's we're excited
and we just listed all of the
counties that are
included either all or
part in the up with someone
and you can see there there's
many can
to.
Double check herself makes reached
make sure we got them all
of New Mexico
production's been in the office own
here is a 4 year
fiscal year
snapshot
as you can see
4.5000000 for in
FY 20 even with
COVID US
6.5000000 in
FY 21 and we had
a crazy great here in
FY 22
and then FY 23
the duty with
the with the strike that did affect
the number but still that is
incredible
incredible progress
for production statewide
and again we.
What's that.
23
right.
The fiscal year 23 we are isn't
even a complete number we're
in FY 24 we are we
are July one
I was just telling us
okay okay
thanks for the clarification
no worries Irish no
no it's all good
I get all I have to think fiscal
years all the time to would is a
start so
yeah we we still had a pretty
darn good year for FY 23
that is nothing
to
the if dismisses
16.5000000
in areas outside of Albuquerque and
Santa Fe.
The next slide of of
page 15
I want to touch on also tribal
lands or pueblos
here's a list of
tribal lands and publicly have been
used slide
productions
repeatedly some
a lot the Navajo Nation is
so popular with our
productions
and we have to
tribal liaison families
on so the Navajo
Nation that are incredible
to work with we
are consistently
ascending productions back
and forth
we sent out location
packages
daily 2
productions that include
tribal land areas and
we have many tribal liaisons
the actor's family is ons
and a lot of
what we have found
is these locations
in these landscapes
many of which are
world class and have
never seen the screen productions are
very excited
and continue to scout and
utilize tribal
lands
and our tribal liaisons
are active in putting new
photos all the time a film
friendly locations on the tribal
lands into our location
database from that
location database
location packages are created
and sent to productions and
decision makers.
And this these are the this first
photo is of the Z.
Pueblo on Alliance
gates under the
road
they had this production had
incredible experience
and thought they were on a
different planet with all that
beautiful white
landscape.
The next slide native and
indigenous content creation
this is of these are a few
highlights
recent highlights
on the left that
shot of the trustco worriers
that is from reservoir all city
feeling I mentioned earlier
Netflix check
she wrote and directed it
shot in New
Mexico
the second photos Ryan
Begay he is incredible
actor kind
of a big deal really really
popping right now
he was just at the film and media
expo on
Sunday
Heat and and he's been in
a bunch of movies
including rest ball and
then the third picture on the
right is stark wins and again
AMC
loves New Mexico stated that
it breaking bad better call
Saul they're back
with dark wins and this
is you know a series
based around
indigenous story and
content and it's shut
New Mexico it's super
exciting they're back
for season 2.
US slide 17
production in the up with zone
or also
from FY 21
FY 23 overall
we did see 150
percent increase in
in production spent in
that up with some
here's some highlights outer
range utilize the
up with some ghosted which is
on apple TV to buy
a which was not flicks
down into this area
and Oppenheimer.
I was up north Oppenheimer
is all over the place
and of over
$100000000
$100000000 have
been spent in this up with someone
over the past 5 years
$0 that would not
be in this in these areas
otherwise.
The next slide I what
we wanted to focus specifically
on this beautiful
County
a lot of indie
films have shot here in the
past several years hot seat
with Mel Gibson the
locksmith
the inform confidential informant
the price we pay a wanted
man
digs squealer
and more movie maker
just name the Los crucis
one of the top places
to live and work as a movie
maker for the very first
time Albuquerque and
Santa Fe were named as
well that that is a huge
deal that is a national
readership that is a huge
marketing
when for New Mexico
for Los crucis and for this
County.
We we we hope
we we make that list again I think
we will the
next slide visibility for
New Mexico just on that note a
marketing with our
film partners in this is just one
example with
Netflix.
They recently and
you can actually scan that QR
code it should take you
to the video but
they created
is a first of its kind website
called Netflix Netflix in New
Mexico it
is a scene by an
international audience it's
also on and on
film.com and this
showcases New Mexico film
productions
locations and
things to do in the local
communities and it's a really
cool would really great
studio produced
sizzle reel and you
can check it out on NM
film.com or scan the QR
code it's
really kind of this one stop
online source to encourage
film tourism it
really
you know bolsters our
image and
calling card as a film production
ecosystem Netflix is
marketing New Mexico
and I could never do that with
my marketing topics budget
so we are really
pleased with that we actually do
have that video teed up we
can watch it now or
later if we have time chair
okay. Right
so let's use technology
thanks to the Burrell College we
have the technology all over this
room.
He
was.
Of
the.
A
lot.
This makes these on.
Thank you chair for allowing us
to show that
and on the website yeah you
can dig in a bit more
about the locations and I
don't know if you could all see it but it shows
the towns in the
top left
so that that will
continue to grow
that marketing is
truly international
we
reached
it's it's invaluable
so that's the kind of thing things
are partners can do
for us
on top of spending money and
creating jobs the
next slide I'd like to get
into our workforce slide number
20
I'm I just want to say
I I'm on the phone a lot
with people who are looking to bring
productions here that's one of our
jobs is to recruit productions
recruit businesses here
convinced that director
producer studio
executive yes
your project will work here
I think the main thing
that helps people get if
they're deciding between 2 very
similar landscapes are
creative
decisions I think
the thing that usually gets
them to choose New Mexico
is
our workforce in our incentive
to things but our work force
is is
absolutely
no.
Nationally I don't know
internationally I don't travel a
lot actually in this job
but nationally in LA New
York Georgia
Louisiana Illinois
New Jersey all of our
competitive and
semi competitive areas
New Mexico is known
for our incredible crew
base they are
world class they are hard
working the it's a friendly
set
it's the
place where you come and
you see people helping each
other teaching
each other on set there's a spirit
of mentorship and
collaboration that you
don't find all the time in
LA people
love working here and
loving they love working
with our crew
and I don't mean to leave out also
are cast we have incredible
side after actors
here we have thousands of
dedicated background
but our crew is really
really hate that we have a
world class reputation with our
crew and so
I like to brag about them a
lot you know
we've made some of the best
alleged best
entertainment ever
breaking bad is
considered some of the best we can
copy better call Saul
the amount of enemies we
track
and how about
on social media with the shows
that are made here it's
quite incredible and hopefully we'll
get some Oscar nods from Oppenheimer
something else but
our workforce that's
that's the that's
a.
Years in the making decades in
the making and I'm
major calling card so I just
want to emphasize
that
right now we are estimating
the film industry offers
about 8 thought we have about
8000 jobs and that
is growing our industry is
growing are you
membership is growing
workforce is growing the
actor pool is growing the
businesses are growing
but we are looking about 8000
estimated jobs in the film industry
of New Mexico.
The film workers yes they do
include our I
oxy local for
80 and
just that membership alone is
2000 members
and they have another 800
people on overflow and that
essentially means people
who have skills and they're
working to gain their membership
hours to become a full
member
that the president of I RC
480 I meet with her
quite often
and they've had
not only so many New Mexicans
move back and rejoin
this jurisdiction which is so
exciting to the tune of
30 to 40 people a
month incoming
to that you
also people from LA in
Georgia moving here for this
industry
so that's just the below
the line crew you 1 of them
but there's also we have
teamsters 399 we
have the cinematographers
guild we have people
inside that we have people in the art
directors guild the
directors'guild the producers
guild the
editors you and we
have the non union workers
are many people who just work
on more non union
projects like commercials or
micro budget
projects
so it's really
exciting and
again I think
what's really help this industry
goes clearly are
15 film and media program
statewide that were established a
long time ago all the
people who laid the foundation
for the incentive in the educational
system that creates this pipeline
of talent
but but
also
and program programs like
F. cap which I'll talk touch
on in a minute that is a need
to program that we oversee
and that is the the specific
goal of that program is
for the career
advancements Kerr's
career advancement of New Mexicans
in the film industry to move
from 1 craft to the
next and move up so
you don't just have a job in the film
industry but a really
upwardly mobile
career
and then there's a lot of other reasons why we
have this great workforce
but
many people in the in
the industry and again there
is this great expo in Albuquerque
just on Sunday.
People been working in this industry for
decades and they love
giving back and they love
mentoring and there's the
higher the PH who
doesn't know anything and is
maybe not been honest that
once but that's
what makes this industry extra
special here in New Mexico.
And we're known for that.
The next slide is very
exciting it speaks for itself
this is the median wage
of full time New
Mexico resident crew
and the minimum
wage you see there $12
the median wage in New Mexico
and all other industries
$19 and
the median wage as of FY
23 is
$35.51
for the film industry
and looks like it might
be growing for FY 24 we
hope but this is a record
breaking year for the median
wage
we hear stories all the time
of creating
people who never thought they'd
work in the film industry who might have
just ended up in the film industry
veterans single
moms
kids out of college
they can stay here they can
work here they can transfer
their skill set into this
industry they can
buy homes they can
live well they can put their kids in
school through
college we hear
these stories all the time and we're actually
trying to capture more these
stories and put them on our
website so we started this little
spotlight program but
spotlight campaign
on our website
but. That
that which speaks for
itself.
The next slide is a spotlight
this is the New Mexico crew
member his name is
Adam Webber
he it has he grew
up in Moore county where his family
has lived since 1840
he was working
construction
in Las Vegas and he
happened to meet a crew member
from Briar patch which was in the
C. series here shooting
a few years ago
he began working in the construction
department on Briar patch
because it was higher rate and they
offered benefits and
retirement and
through F. cap the film crew advance
the program that we oversee
he he went
up the ranks you got mentorship
on the job and he's
now for men in
the construction department for the
film industry and this
is a quote from him it's a definite
self esteem boost and
encouraging to be given
so many opportunities for advancement
in his career his annual
salary has tripled and
his wife Jessica has now also
left to work in the film
industry.
The next piece of
section I'd like to get into is
there are businesses and
revenue for local
businesses
the film industry really
is it
operates on
utilizing a lot of
different kinds of businesses
and local businesses
one production company one
production might need
you know lumber yard
hotels restaurants gas
station rental
cars
make up supplies
a dry cleaners
it goes on and on and on if you
think about your building on many
set if you're building a set
you're building a little town if you're
building a
something on the back lot if
you're trying to create a whole
city for a
series and you're
putting up all the crew and the
cast
in somewhere another if you're traveling in
the state you need a lot of
different businesses to support that
production think about the plant
in the in the shot the
desk of the curtains
the paint on the wall who welded
the gate so
on and I'm filled up and
in some.com we have a
directory of
all not only
locations but also
businesses New Mexico
businesses that offer
all kinds of services and
goods
it's a massive directory
it's a great resource for
every production because again
with our incentive if
you don't hire
local and you don't source
locally you're not going to get the rebate
you're hoping
for.
The next slide is
a quick our business
owner spotlight this is
Alan I felt
he's phones the Castaneda
and the plaza hotels in Las
Vegas we did
an interview with him
and essentially I'll just
read is
authorize a quote
or to read one
when COVID hit we work closely
with the tourism office the Film
Office in the city's family is
on because the most
important thing to many businesses
in the community is
filming outer range
needed one of the hotels entirely
for several months many
businesses were shut down with no
opportunity for income
which would have been us but instead
we had a wonderful season
and then he talks about how the
film industry has impacted his
community it grows job
opportunities for his community
members
and he's seen
the the positive impact
it's made on Las Vegas
the net benefit to communities like
Las Vegas is
enormous.
The next slide is
are at the I'm gonna
touch on the sound stage
infrastructure because this is
another revenue
opportunity for New Mexicans
and.
We have now
21 qualified production
facilities around the state
we added 8 just last
year in Los crucis
in Stanley Albuquerque
and Santa Fe we
are always in need of more
facilities
we we talk to our
families on is about this quite
often that if you know of a good
structure in your
community which
has at least 7000 square
feet and an 18 foot ceiling
height we can probably
make it work in productions are very
scrappy and they know how to take
a a building and
maybe base their production
there are turned into a mini
soundstage so
we are always looking for
more places
for productions to base to
have a place to shoot in all
areas of the state so always
know that we are
here and we qualify those
stages as per
statute
also we can always use more
movie ranches we
have some of the best in the
nation
and they're gorgeous
the if we qualify
them and when I say qualify
I mean that is part of the incentive
for production utilizes
a qualified production facility
they can get that extra 5
percent on their
rebate on eligible
expenditures so movie
ranches we need 50 acres
with 5 exterior
structures maybe it's a barn
maybe it's a little
cabin maybe it's
a just a
facade of
something
more move movie ranches around the
state would be a huge calling card
for us and to help draw
more productions outside
of the
corridor.
Also I want to note
that business owners with
any kind of land or
structure.
Doesn't matter what it looks like
usually we need it for
production so it
could be a rundown gas station
it could be a piece
of raw land it could
be an empty
office building all
of these are potential filming
locations and so
we also encourage the community
you always upload photos
and list their property in our
directory if people
want that is an extra source
of revenue or
just to have you know stranger
things shooting your house or
something M. F. I
can interrupt is yes second just because
we've got Elizabeth teachers from the
city economic development department
is that like a partnership that you
work with I mean if you're looking for
vacant locations or businesses
I mean especially when we're trying to
keep that money in our community in
support of local businesses do you
have those partnerships with the
EDD offices we
we usually work
directly with sometimes
we do work with the EDD and sometimes
we work directly with the families on
so we work a lot with the Los
crucis okay
you're a high under.
Yup and Amara are
you hi.
Yes the cashier great thank you
yeah.
Workforce development
so yes we have this great
crew yes
we have these amazing film schools
around the state that have made
this creating
of but also we are growing
at this incredible
pace and
so we knew we needed to
figure something out
to address this need
for more skilled crew
quickly
thus the New Mexico media
academy came
about and this
is a
certificate program and
it is in collaboration with the
15 schools around the
state and this will
provide on site
training for New
Mexicans and it's a very
fast track program
the goal of this program
is to quickly learn a
craft a
specific Croft that is
in demand that you're interested
in and get you on
a rate production and
you're off to the races with the
job that is the goal of
this program
there will be so below the line
is creating technician work
an above the line is
producer director
screenwriter
both will eventually
be part of this academy were
absolutely focusing on below the
line first that is the greatest
need that's where the bulk
of the jobs are
and these high paying jobs for the
$35 an hour median
wage exists
and there's thousands of those jobs
so that's the focus and we will
have a specific focus
on native and indigenous
indigenous talent
recruiting and content
with the academy the
executive director Chad
Burris just came online
in April he
is native himself he's
a producer he's a filmmaker
he's a visionary he's an
entrepreneur he is
putting all of this together
and really going to roll
something out that
is
of about job
pathways and
job competencies
because we already have all these great
film schools and with you
and DCC
in collaboration we will have
this quick craft
training and
pathway to a job on a
production.
The next slide on more
on workforce development
this is these are just
some highlights of some other trainings
that we have done the New
Mexico film office
over the past several years
we do an ongoing free
production accounting training
program it's 1 day
it is free it is
virtual
we did that very
intentionally so that we could
have anyone from
any part of the state you would not have
to come to Albuquerque and Santa Fe for
it and after
taking out 1 day free
production assistant
training you are
eligible for F. cap
and you are also placed
in a specific database where
productions
we give this database to every
production in coming to New
Mexico and they use
that database to hire their
PTA's so that's
been really successful
we have local producers
teaching that is really exciting
we do not outsource it it's
very New Mexican through and
through we've also
done production accounting trainings
with Netflix payroll
accounting trainings
with Netflix Netflix
also interviewed all of
the US people
who've completed those programs
for jobs
background performance
101 set lighting
is coming up our
wrangling coming up
we have a director shadowing
program with NBC
and we do an annual
screenwriting incubator with
Stowe story labs 1 of the
best screenwriting incubators
in the nation
they.
Choose 10 New Mexican
of coming up and coming
writers that on to be screen
writers with
a great story and over the
course of 6 months these New
Mexicans get the best
mentoring and
feedback from other screenwriters
and by the end the have a pitch ready
script
for.
The last piece on workforce
development is
the F. cap program
many of you have known about this
has been around for a long time
it is best in
class
often times I get
like the MPA the motion
picture association
from Canada called me
recently and said this
is the best workforce program we know
about how do we copied it
and I said here's if it's
all public.
But here's some of the numbers
it's really incredible
is since it started back
in 2004 over
3000 positions
that means people in different
positions moving up in a
career have gone through
that program
335 production
companies have participated
and there's also a
subset of F. cap that is
operation soundstage
and that is specifically for veterans
and essentially if you're veteran
with transferable
skills
you can be F.
cap eligible
and also have some you
joining fees waived
a reduction in required
hours for joining
them you so
that's an something we're very
proud of to.
This these next 2 sides
kind of show you what
other competitive markets are doing
with their incentives
a lot of them we
know about California they have
a massive cap 33
330000000 a year
New York just raise their to
700000000 a
year Georgia is
uncapped with a 30
percent incentive
you can see there
but again not all these
incentives work is as
ours does the George is
not based on George spend
you can source for many
business and how to bring in any non
resident and get that rebate that's
not how we do it
burgeoning markets is what I want to
highlight.
Arizona recently passed a
film bill and they now
have 125000000 a
year they could be
competition in time they do
not have a crew
base
they do not have a phone
schools they do
not have our locations in my
opinion
however that's
interesting to note
also Oklahoma.
Is is busy
they have 30000000 a year
they don't have the diversity or
the crew is at by
any means but
that's a close that's a close
territory in some productions
might choose yeah we'll do Oklahoma
instead of New Mexico
if it can work out with their
budget New
Jersey
is definitely up and coming they
just did something very similar
to our phone partner legislation
with Netflix in
Texas recently
increased to $200000000
cap every 2 years so
comparable comparable to
us so that's new
Texas could be competition
they do have some schools they have
a lot of people but they
don't have
they don't have the
brand in the marketing the
reputation that we have and not
has been decades in the making and that's what
we don't want to lose and
we also have this very smart incentive
that is helping New Mexicans
we are averaging
at about 75
percent resident crew
right now we were
averaging 75
percent last year and the year
before so it seems
like why are we growing we
actually are more
projects more
spend we keep breaking records
and we are scaling that crew were
staying at a 75 percent
resident crew but this
Academy and our film
schools we will
increase at an increase
that other states
probably can offer that kind of
resident crew except for California
New York
Georgia.
The international markets you can
glance there though they all work
very differently but summer
up to 45
percent
and very very generous we
like where we are we
think it's strategic and
smart
the ecosystem I talk about
when we market New Mexico why
is film production so amazing
here I'm probably sounding
like a broken record it's
locations it's landscapes
it's our work force it's our
businesses it's
our incentive
that is the keystone
it's also our proximity to Los
Angeles it's our
lifestyle and
it's and it's also our
infrastructure we're do have stages
movie ranches
and we
people like
especially creating
who live here you can have a great
quality of life and work in the film
industry you can't do that in
these other really competitive
areas you can't own a
house see your family
a lot not be driving
2:00 hours a day on the
405 in LA
and work in film here you
can have a quality of life and work in
film and how many crabs
services include green
chili.
I will get back to you on that chair
I mean that was that
was just really like
yeah that's a selling point
as well it is it is the
food the lifestyle you
know Vince Gilligan has said
he he wants to
be here onset
because this workforce it's a
family but also
offset it's so
important where you are on
your days off and
if you're writing a script or
directing you want to be inspired
and you want to eat some delicious food
and you want to see some beautiful
architecture or
blue sky
or some space some
space and not isn't
found everywhere
so New
Mexico
it's
definitely.
I think we're we're on a
trajectory to be
a premier international
hub soon
truly.
Last I want to talk about
feeling involvement C. statewide
and just some resources
we have these liaisons I mentioned
prior we have about
56
liaisons now
including liaison from
cities towns counties
tribal lands we
will meet with them on a regular
basis and
they really help us get pictures
and location data base
they also help with local
production needs
permitting things like
that so that's a really that's
also unique program not every
state has families ons
and we wanted to we wanted to
spotlight Gen waffle who
is our families on
who is our families on
for or terra county since
2006
she is a
force she's fantastic
at what she does some
of her credits include transformers
wanted to this is
production she's brought to her
area the book of
Eli men who
stare at goats 12
strong
a high fashion photography
shoots for like TJ maxx
Marshalls Nordstrom
she says
film has a profound this is
her quote from has a profound
effect on our communities
outside of Santa Fe and Albuquerque
it provides another revenue stream
for established and new
businesses in our
outlying communities
it allows rural film locations
and attractions added revenue
and interest to be part of
this creative and innovative
industry in a way that
perhaps property owners and
attractions had not even
thought of
before.
And finally here's just
a list
of. Things
that we offer on
the industry directory which is all
those New Mexico
businesses
you can also creating can
list themselves if you have special
skills skill sets
also are location database
is one of the largest
ever in the wake
we hear it's one of the largest in the
nation lots of photos
there are to provide any look that
you might be looking for
growing each
week
do you have a qualified facility
in your area please reach
out
another way to fuel statewide
involvement is if you do
not have a families on in your
area reach
out with and appoint one and
we can start meeting with that person
and help get that
person up to speed with how to fuel
the industry in that
area
also becoming a film vendor
this is something businesses can
do the other taxed
revenue site it's basically
a form that you fill out and
I and tax revenue
insurers that you're
legit and
then
the production companies can
see a film vendor list
it's basically just a pre vetted
list of businesses that
you can work with and expect
a rebate if you work with
them
we also have the free free
training ongoing production
assistant other things
through our office we have a
newsletter that just kicked off
again last month every
and that'll give all kinds of duck
updates and then we do tons
of social media where
we post everything so if you
don't care about anything else just
maybe follow us on social
media thank you
so much I appreciate
your time and attention and will
stand for questions
thank you so much amber
and.
You know I I I think of and I
we've got Representative
Armstrong Representative Roybal
Caballero and Senator
Shendo if there are
others.
Okay
okay
all right we've got to
I do want to that we do have
the next
generation film institute
this is literally right up the road
up this road right here that
is a partnership and done in a community
college and
chancellor Torrez was here
earlier
and she's looking forward to
working with like we have charter
schools here are magnet
schools that that have media
programs this year middle school
Los crucis high school
like helping to cultivate
these this new workforce
and like really trying to grow our
own and so I'm
really excited about that and
and as we talk about we know our
different communities are all
figuring out their partnerships and
really addressing the
strengths and being
able to make sure
that our communities budget so I
I'm I'm grateful for that
I would recommend.
A partnership with the
tourism department
of did you see
that.
Good yeah you can take a look at
that of the and
because the thing is is that I've
I've seen some movies on here
and some productions that I'm like all I
have to go look at that
and I can tell you and I've been watching dark
winds I'm like looking at the
locations like where was this
filmed because
I'm like oh I
you know and I think that's something
that I I don't think I'm alone
in that of going that's I know
that place
so did you see that
so yeah
and speak because I love that and I
think that would be great statewide
campaign so representative
Armstrong you're gonna go first and then
representative of a couple you know you're
next thank you
madam chair and thank you for the
presentation I
really want to thank you for
moving that
line I
have been whining about that
for several months
and years
because the court was
included
in that and so they didn't
get the up left
was no tax
credit so and I have a
of filmmaker in
Sapporo county and he was
he brought it to my attention I had no
idea that that was an issue
so thank you thank you thank you for
finally doing that I appreciate
it
I need can you just
specifically tell
us how to
what I want to do is bring back to
my communities is
how do you get on the
directory list how
do you you know there's
several ranches in my
area that
I'm sure would be happy
to be on the list so
how do specifically do you get
on the list for of
for businesses and
for possibly
locations
thank you so much chair members
of the committee thank you representative
Armstrong for
all your comments on the
the change to border we
agree. And
with regard to
getting it businesses listed
in the industry directory
I will follow up with you
right after this but it's very
it's pretty intuitive we hope
it is at least if it isn't let us now
but NM film.com
and one of the main tabs is
industry directory
in in that you can
either list
list your business or list
yourself if your crew member
are just as skilled person
with any kind of
skill set to offer the industry
so you can list your business there it's
all self listing
so it's yup
you can add photos you can
add tags
you could. However
you want to do it so that's
there and then as far
as the movie ranches it's
very exciting to hear we would
love to help
that process so
if of the
property owner would essentially
reach out to our office
and we have a very simple
form that
requires just some information
we would come and look at the facility
ensure that everything is
looking you know correct and
accurate and then
but we could qualify and
added to the list of qualified
for facilities that we
send every production
and we would obviously want
to bunch of photos
taken of that and we could do
an extra spotlight whenever we
launch a new facility or
movie ranch we do an
extra spotlight
on social media or something so people
know it's there
but it's very quick and we're
happy to help
yeah.
Thank you. You
representative Representative Roybal
Caballero thank you
madam chair thank you to
representative Armstrong because
I was going to make a similar
comment on that
up the phone so
we've been strong proponents
of changing the lines
in and increasing
our film industry
into the smaller communities
but I know also madam chair
that we have a lot of infrastructure
that we need to help contribute
to in order to make
that happen so that's where
that cycle
of many in an
out and back into the
communities is so very
important so I wanted to point
that out because you're
economic
on
all of the
numbers that you presented
in here give us
that clearer picture
of what's coming in what's going
out
and
how we can build on
because that was the whole point
in I just wanted to say
that I've
witnessed
on madam chair
the the the
development of
our film industry I came back
to New Mexico
in 2001 right
after on
911
to take over economic
development in northwest
New Mexico
Cibola County particularly
and I worked under
a little bit under the
Richardson administration
and what began
previously and during
as a an
idea which
economic development always
begins with madam chair
has grown into what you
just presented to us
so it has more
than proven itself
to be a
permanent and
sustainable presence
in our state
and it has more than
proven itself
to be just so
exemplary that
other states are now
modeling after
our
our successes
and I think that's
beyond commendable
on I think that if ever
there's
sustainable revenue
stream madam chair
and we. Have to point to success
stories this would be one of
those and so I'm so
incredibly all
proud of that and I just wanted
to highlight that
but I also wanted
to talk about
your.
The slide about the minimum
wage or the medium weight
to her and
I just wanted to make sure that I
was a little clear
on that let's
see I don't have a page number
but you know which one I'm referring
to the median
wage for
a full time resident
crew page memo
to page 22
okay.
Thank and
madam chair I often
talk about my oldest
son is in the inner film
and came in business he
works for DreamWorks
in Los Angeles
he's now the father of my 2
oldest grandchildren and
I'm constantly trying
to get him to move back
to New
Mexico
and so this helps the the
the the median
wage
helps although he's a little bit higher
and at this point because he's
been there with them for a long
time but when they come
to visit us it's constant
enticement you know get
out of that hurricane zone
tropical zone that
earthquake zoning continue
Mexico but anyway
could you explain
so it
says we've
grown that in the
medium weight
tried 2022
are where we are now
so it is
3551 right
now correct
correct chair members
of the committee yes Representative so I
I want to highlight
that because
the second part of the
story is
what you just compared it to
the $12 an hour
New Mexico minimum
wage. That
should make us all
incredibly embarrassed
I think to a large
extent
because
our state minimum
wage as
we all know on
is not a living wage
and in certain
parts of our state
we have
detailed data
that states
what our
minimum wage should
be in order for a
family of 4 to be able
to afford even a 2
bedroom
rental property
and that in
Albuquerque
is of close to
$20 an hour if
not more
so.
I draw that attention to
my colleagues on this committee
because as we continue to
entertain
the the
bills
increasing our minimum
wage this is
a strong picture here
that we need to point to and
I I think that's incredibly
important and finally
I want to
because we need pardon
me on this just to
expand we need
to on.
Yes not just the
hard questions from our
business
communities.
About minimum wage
raising the minimum wage
and and our
continued populations
living in poverty constant
state of
poverty.
So these are the kinds of
comparisons that I
think are important for us to
highlight so
finally
Representative I do want to go
ahead remind we have 4 more folks
are so finally
I do and and I'm keeping within
my time frame.
So I just thank you madam
chair so
finally I did want to say
that in Albuquerque
in my district I'm happy
to say that there's a favorite
little diner
that I see around central
in 98
constantly being
used and I
love to see the production
trucks in the side
streets and I love
to see that change
how they change
sits
omelets constant
and and
I love to see members
of my district
employed.
During the
these construction
up and down on
sets so for that I
want to say thank you in my
district so thank you in the state
of New Mexico says thank you very
much thank you madam chair
thank you Representative Senator
Shendo.
Thank you madam chair and thank you for your
presentation.
It's good to see you fortunately
the struggle because impacted you
know all our
communities and so
forth of a question
I know that the the
up live for at least the
of the year rule
of when we did away with
it but one.
The issue came of
my intention with regards
to I know that we're trying to help
in on the tribal communities but to
60 pueblo is within
that.
Radius even
though it's of the
reservation it's
I I they were trying to cover their
old of
casino to
a movie studio but I
believe they're not able to take
advantage of certain incentives
because from city
hall of Santa Fe
to to 60
is with in the 60 mile
radius of
or whatever that zone
that we put together
member we checked we went
from county
line
2 you know
so for so we've
expanded it but since there
with in that
I'm not sure exactly what it is I got
contacted by somebody
but if you can look into
that what
of
with our legislation
they're not able to take advantage of
certain things I'm not quite sure
what that is but I
know that but we're trying to do
is covered their
conceded to the to the studios
and stuff I think they did
some things but they were trying to take advantage
of certain senators
but they were not being applied because
the even though there tribal
government it within
that.
Zone that
then
it.
The the sentence
or something like that okay
thank you thank you chair
members of the committee should
Senator I will
look into the stock I think
I understand what
of the I am hearing
that yeah they're not in that
uplift to put
10 percent up with some
right because it's too
close to the city hall of Santa
Fe right but
I will just double check
and I and I I'm happy to reach
out to that constituent
directly to
okay I'll follow up with you I
I believe it was it I believe
it was the the new Santa Fe
commissioner that has that
the the guy knows
in the risk food to us in Santa
Fe. The
delivery guy yeah yeah he's
a new Santa Fe County commissioner
home okay and he's the
one that brought that up to
me I think a couple
months ago and
so I I don't remember his
name but he always delivers food for
us yeah it was really amazing food
etcetera etcetera he wanted to respond
well I'm not okay
I what did you want to
answer that you're not on
madam chair was one spot okay
if I may on that point.
Senator thank you
so as the author of the
the rural film incentive I can
explain a little bit why
it was even created in why the
boundaries are the way they
are. The
film industry every film production
over basically 0 or $2000000
is requires
the hiring of you creating
and so what's happened over time
is that creating is
developed around the infrastructure in
Albuquerque and Santa Fe
and the union rules are the I. out
to you rules the below the line
the main you creating is
is that when they
travel
over 60 miles they
become one thing called the nearby
higher in there otherwise consider
local higher if they film within
60 miles of where they
live okay
page 2 suitcase within 60
miles of Santa Fe so
when you heard about 3000 union
members earlier if
you plot that out a map what you
see is that they're all located around
Albuquerque and Santa Fe because that's
where the jobs get created that's where
the infrastructure is that's where the
studios are so
everything within 60 miles
of that really
they're all part of the same zone
because you have all those creating and so
what happens in when they travel
out of that 60
miles the
film production has to pay
them per diem and mileage to
travel beyond that
that's why we created the rural
film and sent over the up with film
incentive because it
was impossible for communities
around the rest of the state to compete
with that.
Hi because they were going
to recruit those kinds of productions
because productions would have to pay
more so
so to speak is already kind of won
the lottery because
as everybody is that's
within 60 miles of that
zone because they
basically have this massive local
crew basin all the productions
mostly are coming to that area
anyway so
the 10 percent is needed
for areas outside of that
60 miles to help
those communities offset that
extra cost
of bringing creating
and so.
That's why
the line was drawn the way it
is madam chair I don't
know what the real issue is with these
with the crew or whether with its with the
infrastructure I don't
know but it's something to
check into any
other of
I noticed on your slide
we're
yes knowledge of the
tribes that are part of
the is that
just a recent list or is
that historical as
well.
Hello he was Pueblo we've
been given film in
there since 19 seventies
and we're not
listed.
So
the other thing I notice a
because I used the one feels
get shot in my village I used to
go watch it but I
noticed sometimes they just have the
county you don't have the pueblo
but for example and I think
will be really important
in all school ever does the
credits that
the tribe is actually
named I know
sometimes it's just it's it's a
Santa Fe County
but I can tell it was
the pueblo he was
Pueblo and all these
different areas because I know the
area very well I
think the marksman was the last
one was shot of
it doesn't even show up
as a missed Pueblo film
shot you know
I was in recent
2021 or whatever the
film came out most of
beginning of that was shot in our
village the the
scene in the village and and
then the C. store and all
that so so I I
think you know if it's
important of
if if on the credit
side you actually knowledge
the the sovereign
nations as opposed to just
the county and I don't know who makes
that mandatory what that
what that is but
I I think that's important
on the knowledge that I
just don't at all care
thank you chair members of I can
I just comment on that chair
on members of the committee
Senator I that's a really
great idea we do
manage the end to credit
piece as percent
bill to and
I think we could absolutely
just ask our productions
to do that
I think that's a brilliant idea
thank you.
But.
Thank you Senator Shendo
yeah Representative
the mid about
millions.
Thank you madam chair and thank you
so much for your
of.
Presentation I have some
questions I'm of high school
teacher so I deal with
teenagers on a daily
basis and I have lots of
conversations especially because my
daughter is a is a senior
in my son is a junior so
talking about future with
them in their in their in
their their friends
and and those of the grades that
I mostly teach anyway
so we have lots
conversations and many of them have
expressed wanting to get
into the film industry and and
different avenues and had
no idea how to get there
so I my question
is.
With your New Mexico media
academy how I want a
little bit more information
on that because of
like my daughter herself she
wants to right
in some capacity
and her dream is to eventually
write for movies or
series and stuff like
that how does
this work you said it's a certificate
program with an internship in
is it doesn't eventually
is that while there
may be enrolled in a in a
college like a 4 year
college getting a degree or how
how does exactly that work
thank you so much chair members
of the committee representative
it's lovely to meet you thank you for
that question
essentially it's it's being
all really fine tuned
right now with our new executive
director but essentially
I would say right off the bat right
here in Los crucis
NMSU
emailing also right over
there runs one of the
best of screen
writing above
the line director producer screen
writing programs in the state
we hear that all the time
I of course don't I
can't refer to any
specific school that is what we
hear so
at the creative media institute
NMSU is top
notch for that if your
daughter doesn't want to pursue
a 4 year degree
with the the academy piece
is definitely
going to be geared
Elise primarily in
the beginning with
creating positions so working on
a set but
at the I
would say working in the industry
myself it behooves
everyone to start out as a
production assistant whether you want to be
director screenwriter
grip gaffer
you learn how it all works you learn
the work ethic and the expectations
of the industry
so the academy
would be something of interest you
could absolutely attendance
you and
then afterwards
do the fast track
certificate with the
academy
and get a specific
crafts training so she could
study screen writing or
producing at
NMSU and then go
to the academy and maybe learn
how to do
make up and get a job
tomorrow well. She's
pursuing her screenwriting career
on the side.
So I hope that helps answer your
question. Madam
chair yes it absolutely does
answer my question because I
mean we're opting out of
a lot of times telling them okay
you need to do something to pay the bills
while you're doing it so you might as
well you might as well be
working in the industry
and then you get to know it and then
what you thought you might be
going into may not
be their actual passion
because I believe me at
at all dealing with a lot
of these high school kiddos
I I often have come
conversations with them that
to what you I
did not think that I was
going to be a high school teacher or of
or a science teacher when
I was their age in any
way shape or form so
so those things
change and you find your passion
and I could imagine myself doing
anything else in the world at this
point so so
that is that is it that is a great
thing to be able to get them
in in that industry to
be able to see what it really
is instead of what they
think it is in their mind
to so thank you.
Great thank you Representative we have
Representative Garrett Representative
mace Mason and then
Senator Steinborn he wanted to finish
up with comments I do want to
be knowledge of
time we
are it is we are eating
into our lunch.
Literally
so thank you very much Representative
Garrett thank you madam chair
thank you for being here
Shane you haven't said much
but you're obviously a
vital part of this and New
Mexican government
economists are some of the sexiest
hardworking smartest people I've ever
met so thank
you Mike
you heard
it.
Can't help it never
knew about it
couple questions so that
New Mexico Film
Office used to sponsor
yearly conferences
which I started going to
I think in 2016
or something and
in you know with the
Representative made about Molly as
COVID
is there any plan to bring those
back or better
yet have them
in different regions because
for me it was a powerful
learning experience
mother of a background
actor but
we you know we have people
that want to get in these
fields and
those conferences were multi
age they had everybody from
middle school to elderly
people very
professional people's for
divers any plan
to reinstate those kind of
things thank you
chair members of the
committee Representative
thank you for your question thank you
for bringing that up
essentially you sort
of touched on what our
plan is we obviously
haven't held the conference's
due to comment
and then just some marketing and
budget constraints
however
are thanking has
been and we started to
already do the planning
on this is go to the
communities because
bringing everyone to
Albuquerque it's
difficult for people to do
that
and we've also decided to
put more
resources out
into social media that is
how we speak to our young
people today
so we've really ramped up social
media we've really ramped up
free training
programs as I mentioned
you know a high schooler could
it I think you have to be 18
to take the production assistant
training that's free and it's
virtual you can be
on the Z. Pueblo and take
it you can be in Los
crucis is so
we've really put money and
resources more toward things that
can be virtual that are
free that are accessible
you don't have to take work
off if you you
know you don't need to buy a
tank of gas to get Albuquerque
so we've sort of
prohibited and then we're
also thinking with
the launch. Of the academy
which is in the works now
a formal launch to really get
the word out to New
Mexicans that will
absolutely have a road show of
sorts around the state
what is this how do you get
involved bring the
kids bring the high schoolers
who are lost or don't know what
to do for their after
graduation you know will
definitely do statewide
marketing and again we are
absolutely we have a
central focus on
on recruiting from rural
communities and recruiting
young people
that is I
think that's part of what
gets me up every day I'm a mother
I have 2 kids I want
my kids to stay here and work here
their creative.
We are preventing drain brain
drain creative
storyteller drain
of hard working people
drain with this industry
and so yeah we've had it
it I don't think conferences are
always the most effective route
and I get their exciting but I
don't think they're acceptable enough
so you
very you answer the question now
we're we're definitely like to
pinpoint communities
thank you and then my other question
is how
much foreign investment comes
that I'm K. pop
fan and I know they're filming
something out a Netflix for
lost.
In
order. I
can you have through
this. Building
something that looks like they're
filming it in New Mexico
but it says it's Texas
but but how much foreign
joint stuff is coming
into our state
via the especially
Netflix which has a
worldwide
outreach or
universal or anything else do we
have a estimate of that.
Thank you chair members of the committee
representative I don't have an
estimate off hand
and. I don't
I think we have to get back to you because
I don't think international
projects are of
major business
driver right now that
doesn't mean it can't
be we
certainly
we we put some resources
into being featured in the
variety the industry
trade variety in the
economic issue that
was New Mexico
was the focal point
of this variety issue at
the Cannes Film Film Festival in
France of course we
didn't go but
New Mexico was featured there
is editorials done on the Academy
local filmmakers
so we are trying to reach an
international audience with things like
that decision
makers who really
decide where to put their
money
but we can get back to you on that we
can certainly look and see I
I don't think it's a large
piece of it but we are
absolutely trying.
Thank you that's it for now
great thank you if you can send those
answers to Erin and then Aaron will
send them to the entire committees
that would be grateful Representative
Mason and then Senator
Steinborn.
One thing
about the but.
It during the last session
in this committee
we had.
You're talking about your workers
and stuff you
know and I don't want
to put a damper on anything
but you and you were there
at those meetings where they were
complaining about
working conditions lack of
value on time this that and the
other you know
when.
The.
You know this slides as
of right as the Legislature
leaves a little in bad
taste in my mouth
then we didn't pass any of
those bills they wanted they were
one not saying
that they're all the I
don't know.
We have already have laws
that are supposed to protect
that but
the.
You know it
just.
What can you do
to.
We're I don't have to listen
to.
This but
I mean I want those people taking
care yes I want your
industry the
good citizens to their
workers and
especially our New Mexico work with
you know all employers
need to be respectful
of the hood they
work. You
know with the.
And it just like I said
it's a.
It's bad publicity
for that stuff and like I said
I know you were there of
me.
I was there to.
Thanks if you all
dressed that issue at
all were.
Yes yes thank you chair
members of the committee representative
thank you for yeah bringing
this up we
did we did it actively
meet with that group the background
actors group of New
Mexico
and I know
ruby well I just saw her
Sunday at the expo
we and she runs that
background group
yes what was
revealed during the session
was that there are already
laws that protect exactly what
they were asking for so after
the session we
met with department of workforce
solutions secretary
more and
OSHA director
Bob generate OSHA
and ruby and we followed
up and we created
a page on our website
and also a page that's given
that it's printed out it's one
sheet to every
production to post
at at set
that is a list of resources
for background really
the whole production but there's
the background hotline
there's the OSHA hotline
there's the department of workforce
solutions what and there's actual
examples if you are not being
paid on time here's who you
call if you
just experience discrimination
here's who you call
we put a bunch of resources
on one page and then the
OSHA posting
that's required anyway on the other
side and that's also
on our website and every
production that registers with the
New Mexico film office now
has that page and
is required to post and distribute
it so
ruby the the head of the
background actors Association
was very pleased with that
we continue to talk to
her make sure we're keeping
a pulse and everything else
and as far as
productions
if there's any complaints about
productions not
paying a
background
which are quite few and far between
it seems to be one bad actor
production and then they give all the
productions about name
as per usual
but
that that we have a formal process
at my office where people
can submit a claim
and that rebate will not be
processed nor
issued. And hello all
of that is resolved so we've
done better education about
that too and that is also on the
page that we hand out is
here's what you do if you're not getting paid
not only go to work for solutions
but please report it to us as
well thank you and you know
all this came out in our committees
that yes the the
avenues with their
employers my
employees have.
We post all of these things
of if I do something
wrong they call
you know in the but
somehow they
were.
All of us when
we. I don't know
we just don't want
a bad name for some of the
members not anticipate
but stuff so
I'm glad you address that hopefully
that hopefully that'll lead
list.
Want to see you don't have
to. Thank you
thank you thank you thank you Representative
Mason and finally Senator
Steinborn thank you madam
chair I will be
brief
Peirsol won a technology
welcome the Los
crucis Film Office who are here in
attendance Amerind Jones
and Andrew hada
and
also
want to thank you
amber for the your
hard work and
former secretary K..
People who work in film
now and your new
economists I know he's he's
up part of the brains behind helping
to figure out the data that helps us
understand how well film is working
for the state so kudos to you as well
but amber to you and
to a Alisha thank you
for you
know I
really get in the trenches
and work in our politics can
be very tough but you all
really have helped
chart of vision and work
hard and work through
that always with a smile
and and so thank you
for that thank you to
secretary K. we appreciate
her service very much
I want to say representing an
underserved area
we've always hoped
that we would get the film
budget that we saw up
north and
what I can understand being an
advocate down south
is what
those of us and underserved areas
and again economically
all to provide that a 60 miles
from Albuquerque and Santa Fe
because that's when the
economics really
work against you recruiting
film. What
we really needed or or meaningful
policies to help us recruit
film production
because we're we were dealing with an
economic disincentive
and for the
first time I think with Secretary
keys in with amber
we we got meaningful policies
we created the up with roll
film incentive to help us
compete and
that's been super important
but even when we
made it 5 percent then we double
that the reality is is
that.
Maybe 10 percent
enough but I what I
want to give a very sober picture
for my colleagues here is
that we need to keep our eye on
it because the
numbers that we're seeing
of the last fiscal year
$16000000 out
of. You know
800000000 were spent
that's about a percent point
5 we're spent a direct
film spending was bent in half
the state of New Mexico.
So well that's
great and that's better than the
45000000 we were
getting before we had
no rural film incentive.
We more needs to be
done and and I
say this just kind of just
to put a
point out there for the Film
Office that
I I look what we're talking
thank you for having featuring
the up left on your home page on
the website that's great
anything you can do to promote the
uplift areas is appreciated
in meaningful at some
point it would be great to
have a fill a series
filmed outside Albuquerque and Santa
Fe which is never happened
I think that's a great thing
to lobby our film
partners up north for like
okay when you gonna bring a series and
granted they do need infrastructure
they do need soundstages
are qualified production facilities you
can't just tell him to go
to the middle of nowhere where there's no
infrastructure but
I think that's another deliverable
that we can try to shoot
for that'll really
help be
meaningful.
And also to my
colleague's question Senator
Shendo about the end credits
issue you know and Senate
bill 12 this last session which
got stalled we did have
an item in there to require
that films would list
the locality where it's
filmed in the end credits
right now under law we do required
to list New Mexico and a
lot of states to Georgia at the
Georgia peach New Mexico
has that in law for New
Mexico it was always
an afterthought about what about the
local community and it's
very tough for local community
right again touch with a producer and say
Hey would you put
in Los crucis again we really
appreciate it.
Just like to but we had a Netflix
series and we put in
that request and then you're watching the movie
okay is it going to be there
at course
not sell
that bill course didn't pass
and I appreciate what you said
director dots and I wanted to ask
would you consider
making a rule even
that would establish parameters
requiring films to do
this I
don't put you on the spot like that
but but also make a good bill
but.
Thank you chair members of the committee
Senator Steinborn
thank you for going
we were here we were BFF's
session and thank you for all of your
hard work
and and
guiding us with politics
guiding me specifically the
politics
regarding the and credit
piece yeah I think
it's brilliant we I loved
that we had that in Senate bill
12 that we're gonna be
knowledge towns and counties
and love that we would
acknowledge tribal lands and
public if
that's something we can do and level
yes absolutely open to
that cool
thank you yeah that's where it's got
to be you gotta ask you got to require
this of these phone production
otherwise it's a very hard thing
after the fact try to get appreciate
the madam chair I appreciate
that all sponsor bill and I made
a logical Sanchez
what
just streamline generous
you senator and.
Also let me look at me look at the
language.
Anyway that's that's all I have thank you
very madam chair and thank you
again member for all your hard
work we really appreciate
it thank you so
much committee for all your questions
I'm really grateful for
that you
know we you know
I think of like
when we see filmed in
Georgia and they do the Georgia peach
what we do from the New Mexico with
Chile's.
Thank you Jerry I love
your did you see
that idea but I do
I think I mean this is
a serious question
rhetorical.
I love to lease it
but and we're all addicted to
but
I feel like we are also
trying to
expand the perception of New
Mexico beyond you know
beyond just
maces and Chiles and
cias which are all
incredible but
yeah we can do that
I think that I was just thinking
because of our our license
plate the chili's being
recognized throughout the
country yeah I
mean we we all know them that
we're more than just one of the most
amazing foods ever
but you
