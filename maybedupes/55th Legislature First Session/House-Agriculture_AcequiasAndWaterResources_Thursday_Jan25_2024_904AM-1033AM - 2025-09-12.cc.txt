so this is a prevaced problem
throughout the state and they
just wanted to share the
prospective that I I received at
that point with that had on and
then as state engineers since
then continual discussions with
communities both the wate.
So III I wanted to.
Representatives
said is that there is intense
need and and this the spending
bill is supported by the the
executive as well as the water
trustword and totality and that
this this gap will would so all
the remaining
projects that that are.

Other employees that work with
our smaller communities.
You know identifying purchasing
them and then transferring them
and the.
Super import.
The.
They have a well.
We're working closely with them
but their biggest problem is
leaky system so if they if they
can improve their leaky system
they're al.
They come back into complaints
with their.
All of these things were can and
then together
and I think maybe what you're
referring to as as the.
For.
We're we're not technically

we're doing is we're
compensating the last to the
river that may occur associated
w.
The the state.

Motion granted.
Okay so now i'm going to turn
over the the discussion of this
minute to a state engineer my
camera
thank you
mister chair
the the amendment before you
really.
The.
Allowed the puts the
language
that was in the bill and.
The.
Originally
we strike.
Requirements.
Yeah.
Reminding those procedures a
little bit more within.
For the purpose though we want
to put the language back to.
That strike out out.
There's also specific amendment.
A minor amendment.
The.
The.
From july.
The lesser
of four million dollars.
We're getting these very large.
For sea.
We need.
Keep the court's haul.
It's associat.
So.
There's no reason to accumulate.
Money available for a project.
That's the the the need for the
amendment and I extend for.
Okay thank for that mister
engineer before we go to the
questions from the committee
we're gonna refer to the
audience and ask for the support
of this new amended bill
members in sport
members of the areas that wish
to speak.
Okay I have got two individuals
what they meant that will.
Thanks for that.
Anything that can make.
Yeah.
Of architect.
Thank you for that
no more

representatives.
The.
Extremely excited the money
going into this water.
Thank you one more comm.
Again.
There's three hundred and total

Thank for that
members of the committee.
Representative.
I think you chair and and thank
you.

that you have created.
Actor in requiring.
Been executing them a timely
manner I very much appreciate
the fact that you've been.
Is there a boston.
Thank you mister chairman i'm
having a really hard ti.
Amendments so on one of our
drawing attention to the third
one.
Blinds nineteen through twenty
one.
Remove the brackets and line
through
after review while after re.
So we're removing all of that
we're removing the brackets and
just lining through.
Through as i.
In this bill no I think that
would be.
And then and then let me just
move on to the remote.
And the line.
So you remove the brackets and
the line th.
Keeping the original language
okay.
It's a pretty s.
Amendment.
She would recommend that you
come back with a committee so.
Whatever you want to do that was
just her recommendation would be
she would rather see a committee
subso that it.
Yeah.
Representatives the mora
mister chairman and in
representative i'm also having a
hard time going through this and
some of these some of these
amendments overlap each other on
peace.
The.
Uh.
Like on page six lines six three
seven and then there's in
another amendment that that kind
of sits on top of that and then
it takes up line six through a
and then.
Then it goes to another minute
right after th.
Stack and it just.
I I read through this bill three
times last night and I thought I
had it in my head and now i'm
wondering that I if I have
anything
what I read and how it's obvious
and changed up
I also
support.
The.
Okay next we have representative
canadian.
Thank you mister chairman my our
lead candy.
Okay any more questions from the
committee
mr chair and representative.
And look at it at a.
You know you excuse me thank
you.
Yeah we can.
Yeah.
I would like.
We could move.
Yeah.
I think.
Represent.
So I would have no problems when
he would like.
And then just come ba.
If that.
Okay thanks for that matter with
your
reps.
As to.
Now we just presented them this
morning so you don't have an
else.
Yeah.
Okay thank for that
representative of chair proceed
with a discussions we've got a
little bit of time so that's
good before we
make our final decision what the
point forward.
I'll be included.
Process for people applying for
the money and with that
alternative to stayed engineer
my camera
thank you
sure I want to apologize this is
my first bill of the
other session I slept many times
to flust session presenting the
slow starting with the
amendments a little bit
difficult because I you don't
have the context of it so now we
can discuss it and.
So with that we could just go
through the bill um
I would refer you to page two
were we have the first
separative change i'm i'm nine
section a section one paragraph
a
go down to line thirteen um this
this really
speaks to
the the methods and how
the water transport must
essentially have review of of
all of the particular projects
being presented and and in this
case.
The uh richardson administration
really is is to to meet the
needs of a regional water
planning area that has completed
regional water plan that has
been accepted by the interest
the extreme commission would be
stricken and and then the
language added address public
health and safety to replace
that.
Yeah i'm sorry to interrupt you
sir which amendment are we
talking about here
we're talking about talking
about the bill I thought she
said about an amendment i'm
trying to figure out okay I I
got you okay thank you i'm sorry
yeah.
This is this is the bill
amending the water project
twenty nine
so if they see a m.
Congregator but on
starting online thirteen the
reason this is an issue
because the the old water
regional regional water planning
documents
serve their purpose we we are
now shooting forward with a new
regional water.
And and a lot of a lot of the
entities that have come forward
a really don't have any specific
reference within the old
regional water plans.
Covered there
so so we believe that
changing that language to uh
eliminate that requirement and
and just make sure that we're
addressing public health and
safety as.
Um
then if you go down to blank
twenty four in the same page we
we would replace implementation
of their own indeed species lack
of nineteen seventy three
collaborative programs.
With waste water convents and
treatment
right now.
We we.
Because.
So that's that's a great edition
and the reason we're
recommending that we.
She's that clever programs
applications because they're
there hasn't been that many
number one number two there's a
lot of funding out there now.
The state the state has a lot of
other funding that we get
allocated through.
We want to make more funding of
available to what.
Include their
then
going to the page three line six
this is another hold over from
the rich and administration when
it was really.
To really have a good
specteum to.
We have a drought task force
also the right.
That advises the transport so
it's a redundant.
Also
hasn't been utilized at all in
the water transport.
So we think strike.
Then you go down to.
Which showed not be l.
This condition really is
problematic because twenty years
doesn't always work.
Over twenty years.
So it's it's it really doesn't
need a definite if you if you're
going to get into
project life spend you're going
to.
Mike is it okay.
So how are we going to control
the quality of design if we
don't shoot for some kind.
I could see where the time frame
would maybe be beneficial.
Thank you for that.
We have other language.
Yeah.
That's where that would it's
kind of redundant issue too so
we we have a pretty stringent.
Thank you.
Yes that's that's true I think
that certain project.
Okay and thank you mister.
Expert witnesses are I just
thinking about quality control
and and I know i'd in the
private world some total cheaper
offer our products are something
in and.
You know life expectancy.
Representative any further
questions on this
we heard from the audience
earlier that this
particular bill and other bills
relative to this have gone
through several amendments and
i'm sure this is not going to be
the final coffee there is going
to be amended amendments made
because additional strange
almost daily so
let's rap up the the questioning
on this amended bill
medium reps a mister chairman
he's only about.
Mister engineer.
Um and page four lines six
um we're just simply striking
the word board and putting in
the authority because I sit on
the board.
Well you know volunteer members
of.
It's the authority that does the
work and we just wanted to
clarify that
so so there's that uh change and
then online ten
we we want to give
more flexibility associated with
how.
We've had troubles
with you know certain unities
are working on their audits and
it's like we still want them to
apply even though they haven't
quite get every little uh data
day and cross the relative to
their specific project financial
records but we want it strike
that a language in line tend to
align level and add in
accordance with all.
And that has to do with
specific requirements for
smaller and.
I'm lying thirteen through
lane seventeen
were striking the requirement of
providing a water conservation
plan
with the application
and it would be determined by
rules adopted by the authority
so there'd be rules or policies
in place to address this water
contribution component
and and as we talked about
earlier with representatives of
morris question we have stated
the plans inspect reviews that
in that also looks at the water.
Components of specific project.
Um so so we would.
The state engineer will still go
through a process on that on the
state of engineer site but not
make it a a requireme.
The project
I know nineteen
through line twenty and twenty
one we we talked about this
earlier
we were originally going to
remove that.
The.
Approvals
you know has extends the the
process quite a bit and
sometimes but
as we discussed in the amendment
we would restore this we would
you know essentially not re.
By both of the agencies that
they mentioned earlier in that.
Umm so that finishes page four
there's one minor chain couple
minor changes on page five line
eleven.
Uh there's there's a things that
need to be included in the long
packages and we we
have a allowed for the.
The fiscal agent fees to be
removed as eligible cost for
reimbursement as they cannot be
funded from severance to
so that's a technical problem
with several stacks you can't
pay fees for fiscal agents
so they would essentially what
it were saying.
And then online fifteen with a
strike
new mexico finance and just you
leave the word authority because
that's.
When they're.
Here's here's the more
complicated one on peach six
because I mentioned earlier as
we discussed the amendments
with these large allocations
through the water project.
This year with the hundred.
That's a big.
The state engineer would get ten
percent of that.
Two percent.
So basically what we're seeing
is well that's a lot of money we
would we don't need that much we
want to cap the stated
in the near amount at four
million.
You know eight percent in the
amendment we wanted to
restructure this language.
It's not quite ro.
Discussed it in the in the
technical amendment to make it
more clear about how the funds
would change for a five year
period in order to use
cap with the state engineer
would take out of the fund but
it would also make sure the
courts got what they ordinarily
would receive so so that's
that's what we discussed in
detail and the amendment and it
and it's hard to do the
amendment first without the
context but nonetheless that
that that's what the section
where the dress so that there
would be more funds available
for project instead of it just
accumulating in a fund that that
would take a long time for the
state in general to tack to tap
and use uhm
and that interparagraph really
really refers to that that we're
trying to.
Going down to line nineteen
um
mr before you go any further on
that we have a question from
rips.
Mr.
Perfect.
Thank you
engineer you can proceed they
could think it mister chair
and moving on to lane nineteen
for striking any project
approved by the legislature and
for and and putting projects.
This this is could be the most
controversial with you off
what and and michael.
That's.
We actually require to
application cycles first we
start with.
Um the august time frame through
november for the water trust for
to approve the projects in.
There's another cycle.
So it's very honest in that
regard that what we're asking
for is a five year window where
we we do we require only one
application.
Are we taking away.
In the reality is the the funds
of the funds utilised have
already been appropriate.
But from a pragmatic perspective
and all the stuff.
This and then also by that time
the original.
That really.
I know that's a controversial
issue.
That we can.
Okay mr engineer before we
proceed I think we got a
question on that representative.
Okay.
It's accurately a.
Five months.
Thank you
on that point mister someone
thank you mr mister state
engineer so.
The format that we're cutting
down.
The time we're cutting out is.
With moneys that have already
been appropriate by the
legislature to quote.
It's because.
The water sport was a spec.
So many things have been added
uh to it over the time because
it works it's a great program to
get many on the ground so it's
been expanded and many small
projects have come in and lots
of other purposes of developed
all the time including watership
projects that we.
Ability to address particularly
now it's important because of
the fire hazards and concerns of
waters that treatment is really
important as well so.
The legislature hasn't really
done anything to change the p.
And so.
We think.
Just sort of blessing all the
projects and waiting until july
one for the funds and require a
second application process.
So
I don't know if you all
remembered last year when we do
the water you know the the the
water project.
That's how the last stance are
last year.
We go.
No let's not do this.
Through the separate tax.
This is a time.
We're having this conversation
because I said it might be the
hardest part of this bill and at
first I wasn't I said i.
Really it is.
Thank you
I think on that way reset of
cate.
Which is
the redund.
Sight that is where you come
back in that last paragraph and
require.
And.
Okay
mister south so then.
If the report is.
The.
Assure representative and we're
going to move
on to getting the proje.
Brought to the legislator.
And representatives tomorrow the
report is written it will be in
m.
So it will consider without.
That thank.
Uh injured here and managed here
does that complete your
explanation of the amendments
sure that there's just a couple
couples you're we already
brought up to change on the last
page from october two december
first of each year that that
aligns anything reporting with
all their other projects so so
that that's a minor changer but
I will put you back on page six
line twenty two this this goes
to representative as else
question about support.
You know help them help
themselves.
To person efficient are giving a
fish kind of approach and that
is it it gives the enemy the
authority to hire contractors to
provide financial and
administrative capacity
development and direct
acknowledge.
That's always been a missing gap
we really want to figure out how
to jump start people's abilities
to
number one the able to apply to
the projects number two complete
the projects and accordance with
our plans specs and standards
and then ultimately properly
maintain and keep those systems
in good check for the twenty
fifty years of life that those
projects are are being
constructed for so that's that's
what this is all about uh mister
with that I i.
Madame chair
you know.
Mr chair and members.
We have a lot of wider problems.
I thought it comes to the
legislature and work on early
childhood and all I do is water
um and I remember somebody
saying a regional.
I never heard of her regional
water plan I said what's our
regional water plan and so I
called it.
Well it shouldn't say that a
lot.
Yeah.
We got.
Well this is what are.
Put something on.
And then they remember the
regional water plan so I just
want to say some legislation
that we do here works some
doesn't that was under
richardson those regional water
plans stone existed all it's
almost laughable it's almost
laughable so so a lot of this
legislation.
This.
Tanks that are l.
I i.
Infrastructure.
Questions mister chair okay
thanks for that manager I think
we had a question from
representative
thank you mister chairman I want
to make.
Money can go.
Just about
water but now we're exp.
Are there guidelines to see.
Because what if we spend all th.
Yes so there are policy
considerat.
So that we try to.
But those are the funds that we
would.
So we feel there is.
Chairman and so what those
would any of those be
permanent staff or would they
just be in assistance until the
project was done like an m o u
sub contract right.
Okay thank you.
One of my other questions.
Current process for immediate.
The other.
We going.
Properly.
Like that in the past and.
So we do ha.
Yeah.
From the technical over.
To ensure that the projects are.
One more thing with chairman rep
then i'm i'm strong.
We need some policy.
Of the water which was.
Regionalization
so
by doing so that throws the rate
base because right now so many
small communities.
And and they have a really hard
time struggling.
You know all that stuff so so by
encouraging over time both
through the new regional.
Opportunities we are going to
have a incremental
life cycle if you will of
improvement of all of these
procedures and and by internet
wasing that
regionalization will really help
me with.
Getting the projects done but
manage into the future.
Thank you mister chairman and
think.
I really appreciate the right
hand.
They can represent them next we
go to maybe the final question
from representative
mr chairman thank you very much.
Questioned about the artists
thank you for that response
whenever you're talking about
what you have added on page six.
Our contractors.
I hope that that assistance can
be done.
That's the goal certainly I am
certain.
Just wait.
It is very.
That because.
Whenever they were drilling some
wells down in my part of the
world
they brought in drillers from
the north western part of state
to dr.
We do a little bit of drilling
down there and yet they.
These drillers from the
northwest corner created.
I applied to effort on staying
local.
Thank you so represent any.
The.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There there is so many
resources.
The trust ones for endangered
species work there's also.
There.
That river stewardship all those
things fit into
a better category.
So we think there's
substantially more resources
outside of the water transport
for this work and so.
Unless.
Rise up and there some of the
things.
Restoration work as opposed to.
We we we would have.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Books and.
Thank you mr chair.
We should know as the.
Every.
A refunding.
Thank you
thank you for the very fruitful
discussions
at this time I would like to ask
what is the pleasure of the
committee.
Bill and then the amendments are
realized now that i'm presenting
this how to confuse everybody
but they're being s.
House bill
to eleven and.
Do we will.
Okay thanks for that so we roll
this bill until our next meeting
on tuesday
thank you.
That being or last week we will
