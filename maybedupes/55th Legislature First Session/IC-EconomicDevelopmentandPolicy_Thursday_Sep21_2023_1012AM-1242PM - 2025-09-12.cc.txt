Hello and good morning
everybody we are in the
second day of the economic
and rural development policy
committee this is the fourth meeting
of this committee I'm senator
Kerry Hamblen and I'm
humbled to be serving as chair of this
committee this year also very excited
to have my by your state
representative during guided
us Representative from the
south
today and tomorrow are topics
will range from hearing updates from
the state Economic Development Department
New Mexico finance authority
we're getting an introduction to energy
grid equity learning about the
economic needs of rural
communities and then Friday
we'll finish up our meeting here with
an update on forest health and the
logging industry we
as well as agrarian
economics a
reminder that there are at least
2 bits of legislation
that myself
and if Representative
Rod Montoya is able to make
we will do like a just a
brief
preview.
Of tomorrow
just to give you a heads up on
it because I want to make sure that you're
informed on this
and then at our very
last meeting in Santa
Fe we will have the public
banking panel in the
morning and then
that afternoon will spend
maybe an hour at the
most discussing
if we need we will not use
more if we need but an
hour at the most
discussing that
legislation and
then voting as a committee either
to endorse or not endorse it
okay so I just wanted to do
the preview so that we could
all at least be
aware and and everybody
is aware of what that legislation
is
it will finish up with public comment
if we have any before we recess
today and for those of you
watching on the webcast thank you so
much for tuning
in.
Reminder I do try as you all
know you all are doing really well
I'm so so
grateful
to those folks representing
to our committee there here at our request
many are giving up their day
sometimes pay invaluable
time I do appreciate
those of you who are working
very hard to make sure your questions are
directed to the point
and also offering
up your colleagues
opportunities to ask questions
as well of it does
seem like we're getting off on track
I will do my best to pull us
back up and it's
not meant of censoring any committee
member but more of
making sure that we respect the
time taken by our speakers in our
committee members and
so we
are very excited
about what is happening
today
we have
a full slate
of presentations
today and I'm excited we will have
some folks from yesterday that are going to show
up again today but we'll
start off this morning with the report
from the New Mexico
finance authority we have
Marquita Russel who is the
CEO of the New Mexico
finance authority Marquita thank
you so much for being
here your Michael get turned
on when you pushed a little talking person
right there on front so
it is all yours.
Thank you madam chair and thank you
committee for allowing me to
spend some time with you this
morning we don't get
to spend much time in front
of this committee so I'm really
excited to share some of the things that have
been going on particularly
more recently
I'm gonna be talking from a
power point that says
aptly report from
NMFA and
I'll take you through
some there's a meaty
stuff in there that I'm gonna hit lately
but I'm certainly happy to answer some
questions or some research data
that's in here that I think
is useful and really hasn't
been presented to any committee yet
so far and then
just some some proposals that
we have going forward
but let me search you on the top of
page 2
just to run in some
instances remind you of who we
are in other instances to
introduce us
to you
NMFA is a broad
based finance agency
that was created back in
1992
where government instrumentality
I'm of of
IT equipment
overseen
by an
independent board whose
chair currently by
Kathy Keith who's the
director of community
partnerships at the labs
she I was introduced to her
20 years ago which used to work
at the economic development department
and has been involved in community
and economic development for
quite some time so she's
very tuned in to
sort of the mission and the
impact of the finance authority
in your communities particularly
the more rural communities in the
state of the
board approves our rules
our policies and our
projects the oversee
our operations and approved the
budget and then we
have a very active
Committee process which helps
us oversee
this complex organization
that I'm gonna step some of which will step
you through today we
are currently staffed with 63
I have a budget right now of
that allows me for 71
like others getting
in good people
is very difficult they have a ton
of options and what
we do is a little
niche so
finding them even more is
is even more so that
difficult
we are as I said.
Broad based we have
expansive legislative
authority
including
Authority from our New Mexico
finance authority act which
predominately
governs our public
programming we have
some project programs
that go back to
1992
but ultimately we are
authorized to operate
24 programs through
13 different
acts so there's a
lot of the th Authority
and capacity for the finance
to do good in New Mexico
the other large piece of
legislation that
oversees our operations
is the statewide economic
development finance act which
just hit its twentieth
birthday it was
passed in the 2003
legislature and it
has brought capacity to
allow NMFA
to sort
of operate as many
other states to do with
this because I public
entities to
help. To
level the playing field for
a lot of projects so
state but yours other
states have
agencies just like ours
that are helping them with issuing
bonds making
loans
providing loan guarantees doing
new market tax credit
but participating in a number
of federal and state operated
program so we look
like those other agencies
when it when it comes to community
and economic development
but that large pieces statute
currently oversees about
6 of our programs and I'm gonna
spend most of my time
talking about some of
programming that will happen through that
particular act and
then a multiple family
I'm overseeing our agencies
overseen by a 32
member NMFA
oversight committee and we're grateful
for their active participation and
oversight.
On page 3
not to spend a whole lot of time
this is the this is the
the of list of legislatively
authorized programs
that the NMFA currently has on
the books so there been other programs
that may have come and gone but
these are the ones that are currently
authorized for us to
operate you'll
see early on the
public project revolving fund it's
the program by which we are best
known we issue
we make probably $200000000
of loans each year.
For public projects in your
communities those are
your fire truck projects
you were school
bonds
we do a lot of
water financing
and this program
doesn't have limitless
capacity but has significant
capacity because it is a bond
funded program so we're
able to go out and replenish
our loan fund as
of we need to make loan
so if there's if
our cash gets low we go and we
issue bonds it's a
triple a bonded
program so we have a
lot of access to low
cost capital and we're
able to provide that
funding to your
communities across the
state the
second program which is sort of
kind of a little surprising
for many is
the primary care capital fund
which was authorized in
1994 and
allowed NMFA to
make loans to
nonprofit
primary care providers
because they had such a difficult
time accessing capital
it's hard to build
facilities in rural
areas you all know this
very well because it
often costs more to
build then you'll actually
get an appraised value for
so that a
program
1994
came in $5000000 was
authorized we made 19
loans to that program
ultimately about $12000000
of loans were made
and that program in particular was
interesting because it allowed
for the nonprofit
primary care clinics to
repay a portion of their
annual debt service through
a contract for service
so that program was very
successful so we made 19
loans about $12000000
but we were able to revolve that
over time ultimately
most of that funding was then
clawed back for solvency
purposes and
so there was I think a
net of $9000000
ultimately made to that program and
9.7 was pulled back for
solvency so we've done a good
job with the with the limited capital
that we had
I would bring you part
way down to the Economic Development
revolving fund again that was
authorized in 20
years ago through the statewide economic
development I. NSX and
we operate a number of
programs through
that particular
fund.
And that'll bring your right down to the and
what you see ultimately is
there's like these little blurbs of
activity about every
10 or 15 years you'll
see some
major burst of new
programming and then we go for a
while there's another new burst of
programming in the
last 3 years
certainly since the start of the pandemic
we've seen a burst of activity
first starting with the recovery
funding and then as a
result of some one time
money and and
a lot of wealth coming into New Mexico
from both state and federal
funding sources there were
other ways forced to participate
so choose new activity coming
on last year as
well.
On the very right hand
the right hand side
you'll see who we are partnered
with we have policy partners
in virtually every program we
operate
and that's important because what
we do is make grants and loans
well and now invest venture
capital but we have partners
that help us decide where
those dollars can best be
spent and
that's you know when there's scarcity
in funding it's important for
us to make educated decisions
about investing those dollars
for their highest and best use
so our policy partners on the
right hand side play a very
important part in
our success on
the left hand side you'll
see whether the program is
active and for some
of those
you'll you'll note that there's
not a funded check mark just to
the right of that and that's
because we may still be
overseeing grant
proceeds but we don't have any grant
dollars left or we may
be
still in the loan servicing side
of it but we don't have new money
to land so you'll
see check marks for what we're
actually currently
consider act
and then you'll see right to the next of
that literally the money
column whether or not
it's a funded program and you'll see
note primarily
what you'll see here is
that we have a
lot of funding for public
projects and that we
have a lot of a story not
a lot of cash for
economic and community development
and that sort have been that's been
the way things
have operated for years
in all of our community and
economic development we've
seen you know
10 to
$15000000 total from
the general fund up until
last year that is
it from the general fund to support all
these projects all the rest
of it has either been funded by
NMFA for has
been federal dollars that have
come down.
And I'll just I won't talk about
it today because I don't
have enough time
but you'll noted the very bottom
are venture capital fund
and our opportunity enterprise
we are poised to have some
of some
good things to announce on that program
are opportunity Review Board
meets this afternoon to make
its first recommendation and that
was from a program that
was created back in
2022 to really
support spec
development
and then venture capital that
was approved in 2022
was suppose some substantial
improvements to that statute
made last year in the
2023
and we're poised to approve our
first 2
investments from the
state venture capital program so we're
really excited about the progress
we've made with the tools
and the and the
investment dollars that you've given
us.
Okay Page 3 of
4 talked to talk
a little bit more
about
the statewide economic development
finance act it is a big piece
of law we had
up until very recently
only scratched
the surface in terms of what it can
do it allows us to issue
bonds conduit
bonds primarily on behalf of
your communities in New
Mexico
those happen through your cities
and your county so industrial
revenue bonds industrial
development bonds bonds for
501 see 3
corporations most of
the cities and counties do
that directly so there's really
not a need for finance authority
to participate but we
have that authority to do so
under what we call sweat
I it allows us
to make direct loans which we
did through the pandemic in the
essential services
with our social services program
that we funded and as well as
our pilot to cannabis
my group is just program that we
funded that NMFA funded
those 2 are the only direct loans that
we've participated
in so far
that the only ones that taking advantage of
that direct loan capacity
primarily we've used that
statute to make loan
participations so we
work with your banks the banks in
your communities to buy
portions of loans for the
yield either
because they want to have
someone share the risk
or in some instances
because it's if
it's federal dollars that we have the
capacity at the time
to take on a portion of that
loan subordinate
to the bank it allows the bank to
lend more on the available
capital so
those of sometimes
for in order
to complete the construction
loan so that they can permit out
so that's the program that we've operated
the most and then
lastly we've had if
the federal new market tax credit
program that we operate through that
law but it
is a substantial piece of
legislation as I said and
we can do guarantees it's a little
of everything this law is
pretty big we've done very
little through it
the 1 funds that we have
to operate from is the
economic development revolving
fund will talk today about some of the
things we're looking to do.
But I've mentioned to date that
the our our successes
really been limited by
capital we have very little
money to land and so
where we have dollars
were able to invest them but we don't
see widespread impact
because we have little
relatively little capital
in which to invest.
What is changing though is
that the arpa
put forth some
improvements and expansion
of a program that was created back in
2011
that's called the state small business
credit initiative those
dollars are coming to New Mexico
and we're working with the economic
development program to
invest those dollars
so what I'm gonna go
through is some research
that we took on
in order to help decide
where those dollars could best
be
invested as well
as to support our state
venture capital we knew
that when you gave us a
state of enter capital
program that you wanted
us to operate a program that
was different than was
already available you didn't
want bigger pots of
of of ready funds right
there are places if you're
high growth company you
can already
access
of venture capital dollars in New
Mexico if you
are a New Mexico business
that doesn't want to have to sell
your business if you want to
just grow your business
substantially in need that kind of
capital don't come from
a history of family
wealth you need some
State Capitol I think that's
what you wanted us to do and so we
took on some of
research to help us decide
where those how we could support
those kinds of projects that aren't
your typical project
so we work with a company called next
street and they have
they are finalizing
a report that will be
made public I think by the end of the
month I've got some
take aways from that and just some
key landscape pictures so
you can see what we're so
you know what we're looking
at on
I you'll just see
what The New Mexico
small business landscape looks
like again there's a lot
of data here and I don't want to spend a
whole lot of time
talking you through charts because
that's just not that interesting
but I would note that about
75 percent of New
Mexicos
small businesses are not
employer businesses so
they may be some
questions some small questions
maybe a real estate a passive real
estate company but
it's most likely your
independent. Tractors
and your moms and pops
who don't pay themselves
salary they take their
income from distributions
from the company that's the
preponderance of what you
see in New Mexico
75 percents about
126000
non employer businesses
in New Mexico that's 75
percent from the data that
we've been able to locate
that's a little
less than what we see
nationally I think the national
average is probably 78 to
80 percent so it's a
little less we if you were
businesses that are being
started in New
Mexico
you can see that the preponderance
of employers by those that
are employer based
businesses the
preponderance of them
of employ fewer than 5
individuals so
you see more than
50 percent have
fewer than 5
employees.
M. 76 percent of them
have fewer than 10 employees
so we're talking about small
businesses across the
board and you
can see.
Just that some more numbers
here I again I don't want to go through
too much more of this but other
than to say that most
of our businesses this is not
something you don't already know but it's got
some numbers behind it most
of our small businesses either have
no employees or very
few employees what
what the feds called very
small businesses that's the technical
term for fewer than 10
employees
so that's what New Mexico's
landscape looks like and we're
building programs
to help fit the
business needs that we're seeing
here.
On the top of 6
are on 6 will then look
at we looked at
how these businesses are getting
access to capital if they're getting
access to capital
and you what you're seeing
here is
that.
Let me make sure I get this
right there's a
couple there's a lot here so
let me take you through the
slowly
if you go to this bottom
graph the under
to to look at
credit tightening
I want to show you that in
that middle buckets so you
have the loans on the left hand
side
you have the loans that are
less than 100000
and you have then loans
between 100 and 250000
and loans greater than
250000
and what we're seeing is that New
Mexico.
Has capitol
there but not
enough to fit the businesses
that we just talked about there's not
enough capital in that
middle market what
with the with this landscape
calls no man's land
it's not that people are being
serve there it's that there's not enough
capital to serve that demand
that's there so
most microloans
we are those are done by
what we call CDFI as
community development financial
institutions
CDFI is typically
do microloans and we
have a robust
microlending environment in
New Mexico
it just there in your
communities built up all call
out one because I think they do such a
significant
job and that is Rehm
spring in Albuquerque
there everywhere but there are
others that are doing
really good work for
microloans most
of the micro lenders in
New Mexico don't
exceed loans of
$100000
they are focusing on
loans of less than 25 or
50000 so they're
talking up there really working
with your of
very small entrepreneurs
coming forward we have a
few but not very
many loans that
are coming into that
$0 or
more bucket
like in 2019 I think
there were 25
loans made by CDFI
is that we're more than $100000
to the data that we've been able to
find so very
few micro lenders
there and then what you see
our bankers who
because of regulation because
of the cost of overseeing
loans are not typically
making loans less than
250000
they're making them but not
at the pace at which these
businesses that we just
talked about need
them so they're definitely
in that market but they're not
in the market to meet
the demand that exists
there and again a
lot of its regulatory
the regulators will tell you
what your loan to value has to
be and what we
just talked about if you're
here in a rural
area you're building isn't
going to be worth as much
as it might be. In a
more urban area and
that's just the reality that they
have so they
have capital but it's harder
for them to land because of
regulations that
that tell them you know
how much loan to value they
can give on
a particular project
so that's a tricky
bucket for them to hit
because it's
they're typically less well
collateralized so the larger
you get off and
there's more receipts behind the
business there may be
other equipment they have a longer
operating history they become
easier loans to
make and still meet the
regulatory requirements
so you see that they're making the
loans they're just not making
the loans at the pace at
which businesses
need and so what we're
trying to do again with
our funding is to target
that niche
the ones between
350000
in particular help
banks get those loans
done.
Are traditional products
The the loan participations
they might help a little bit
but again if your issue
is a regulatory
of debt limit
or regulatory loan to
value requirement
alone participation isn't
going to be very helpful unless you're
willing or able to take
of subordinated interest to the
bank unless they can see
your dollars as
of equity to the
project if they see
it as a shared collateral they
can't make that loan
so we needed to find
new ways
and these federal dollars that we're
about to get and really help us
but that that
Netsch.
So anyway that we can
do risk
for loan for but
lenders the more
capital that's going to go into that
area so we've we
make it more economical if
we take away some of that
risk that bucket gets
filled and there will be
just one tool
New Mexico there's a lot
contributing to that lack of capital
in the middle there so we
won't be able to fill this
bucket with one tool
we're gonna have to fill it with several
different tools in a very different
way so we'll be looking
at tap tailoring some of the venture
capital dollars to help
with some of these and we'll
be looking at the debt
dollars that are being made available
through the federal dollars to
to target some of the so I wanted
to just make sure that
that
that that was really true that
I have that up that was really
clear.
Are in we don't you don't see it
in here so don't look for these numbers
but 15000
businesses are what we
estimate from the data we have
available that would
have the revenues that
would fit that middle bucket
15000
businesses.
And as I said about
25.
Loans were made in 2019
and that's the most recent data we
have from CDF
by so they're not
able to really fill that bucket
25 out
of 15000
potential borrowers
there and our
banks.
Maybe 1200
were made recently and again
it's a difficult market to
hit so we want to make sure that whatever
the lenders and by that I
mean CDFI
is credit unions
and banks whatever
helps them do risk those
loans and increase the incentive
to make those loans are what
we're trying to
target.
And then there's some
more data here on page 7
related to banks
I'd like to spend
I know we have limited time
today madam chair if
I could just talk about
some of the programs and the federal dollars
to come down I can come back and answer
questions about banks
but I I think I've made my point
think you're hearing that
you know it's not that banks
are doing a job
it's just that the job is too big
given that the requirements
that they have to do this alone
so if I could then
move you want to page
8
we talked to small businesses
we had 42 we have
5 focus groups
across the state
42 entrepreneurs
were.
Or
participated in that we looked
at main street to consumer
businesses
we looked at the business to
business service providers
are business to government
providers contractors
rural businesses and native
Spanish speakers
again what we came down to
is right sized financing is
the significant need that we
have you know
you need to be in their area you
need to understand the product mix
you to understand the working
conditions but
ultimately it's the
right size financing that's
the target
that we need their so
again.
Don't spend a lot of time but
page 9 is the
is the page I think you've probably
seen a version of
this
from your last presentation
I think the F.
up folks utilized
this page as well
and I wanted to get in
we've put some more dollars to
this we have a better understanding
of how much we think is now
needed in
these particular areas
so there's a little more data here
than you saw before
in your idea in seed
stage most of those
loans and or investments
are about 5 to
$500 to $5000
they're very small this is where
your micro lenders are doing a really
good job.
And you see to the just to the
right of that who are the most
what we have found to be the
most active participants
in New Mexico
that other one again
revenues
a greater than
$250000
those loans are between 100 and
250000
and those are where we need
to help find ways
to de risk these
loans for banks it's not
a matter of capital it's
a matter of risk in economics
for them to be able to make
that.
At one more page of
this capital landscape and then I'll
get to our R. S.
S. BCI
again what what I really want
to be clear on is
in these 2 buckets on the
left this is what we're trying
to target with the combination
of the venture capital dollars
that you've made available to us
and the federal
state small business credit
initiative S. S. B.
C. I. dollars
our target for S. S.
B. C. I. is that 0
to frankly 500000
because we're going to put in there also
our loan participations
we think that there are about
3600 middle
sized businesses seeking
capital in that in that
area with total financing
needs of about
715000000
based on our current
data in
the start up cash the
gate those are those less
than certainly
5000 there's
about just over
19000
businesses non employer
businesses seeking that capital
we think there's a need of
197000000
based on the data that we've been
able to find so we
looked at
you just sensitive to census
data we looked at small
were self reported
small business survey
data and we
did some interpolations
of that in order to help kind of
figure out how much capital
we're talking about in each of these
areas so
750000000 is
far more than we have available to
us and I just want you to know
again that there's not one way
that we're going to fill that bucket that
buckets going to have to be filled
multiple ways throughout
the state because every and every committee's
gonna have different needs
and then there's restored of capital
that capital
is not
a focus of our current
funding because
there are significant needs it's
also incredibly expensive
to do this kind of funding
you need more technical assistance
you need to be actually in their
communities and as
an agency of our size we're
just not able to be in the state
this big into every
community at the levels
needed for this restorative
capital so I don't want
to such. Just at all
that it's not incredibly important
because it is but it's
not something that we think we can
fill a gap we can
fulfill very
easily so we'll have to
work through partners to the extent that
were able to do
that.
So we'll go to page 11 and
again this is where I
think.
We have some exciting
I think it's exciting
but I kind of a
nerd
so on page 11
the Congress as I
mentioned re authorized
and expanded the state
small business credit initiative they
started this in 2011
with the first financial crisis
coming out of the jobs act
New Mexico got
$13000000
and that's just not enough
money to make a difference
you can do a few good deals but you
can't change the
sort of underlying fundamentals
of of a
gap a lack of capital
at any size with
$13000000 in the state
of our size.
So we were able to make you know
maybe 20 loan
participations all of which
have been you know paying off
they've all been very good clients most
of them pre pay their
loans the
state almost immediately
after we were able
to fully allocate the
funds the
state made the decision to
send 5000000 over
to form the
catalyst Fund so
it was the $5000000 was given
over to the state investment
council to participate
in the catalyst fund so that was
the first fund of funds
it was able to really leverage
dollars I think they leverage up
to $40000000 with
that sort of first look
at an alternative model
of venture capital so
that was important but it wasn't
overseen by the finance
authority
the federal government
is is
identified
$74000000
for New Mexico so this new
expanded program
is substantially larger
and has a lot more
potential for to make
a long lasting difference
in New Mexico to actually sort
of change the
landscape
their to their focus the federal
government's focus
is small
business financing and by that they
mean that very small business
that's fewer than 10 people which
we saw earlier 3
quarters of our employer
businesses and
what they call socially and
economically disadvantaged
individuals cities
and that's either going to be determined
determined by the location
of the business or by the
owner of the business
so 2 thirds of
our census tracts
qualify and said the
census tracts so
most of New Mexicos
already going to be in a
city
community
but if the community if
the of
projects being located there
if it currently exists there or
if the owner is of
a disadvantage one of the
many disadvantaged population
identities
then that is also considered
a city business and it's all self
certified so
we think that the dollars
particularly New Mexico with our
very small business focus
and the preponderance
of to start demographic
of make up
that we are really
the.
In a position to take advantage
of their targets and if we
do were able to get all
70 4000000
so there are there's sort of
bonus dollars at the end that you're
able to get so we get
I think up to 60
5000000 and then after that
we have to the last
$9000000 comes
if you're able to meet the targets
a very small business and setting
funding and investments
so we think we're poised to do that
we believe will get all 70 4000000
in
the Economic Development
Department is the agency
that that actually
receives the state
small business
dollars
and they as they did in
2011
they made a of
an application for the funding
and then asked us
through an M. a way to administer
those dollars so we admit
we were the first administrator of
the $13000000
they are actually doing a little
more with these dollars this time because
there's 70 4000000
as opposed to 13
and so there's a difference in the way in
which there they have a
requested the use of
their application initially
which went in in February of
22 before
the the legislature
approved NMFA
to do venture
capital lending their
land their request was to
use 9000000 for what
they call their cap program their
collateral support
collateral assistance
support program but that's
where they'll put
a CD in
2 of make it available
for lender if your bank
or credit union goes into
your actual
this institution
if you're CDFI they
make it available someplace
else and that's then
available for any collateral
deficiencies in the
short run should something go
wrong so that's really
helpful for
some that may be trying to get
through their construction lending
and then permit out with 1
of the SB a 504
loans or something like
that it's been very
useful for a number
of projects
so they're they've been operating
that Sam Collins over the
echo. The development department
is operating that program and they're
doing a great job with it
so 9000000 of their
request to the
treasury was to stay in
that program we don't anticipate
that changing the
65000000 is what
they've entered into an M. away
with NMFA on
and that is they
initially requested
all to go to venture capital.
And because again the
state venture capital
program at an MFA did not
exist and the proof points
that you made in 2023
we're not part of the
deal then.
The reality is
that the federal requirements
around equity are
so stringent that they
won't actually help the businesses
there hoping to serve so
they they will buy very by
its very nature hit
those very small businesses because
most of these venture capital
deals don't have any
employees when they get started
so the hit those but they won't
hit the studies will be in the
high growth businesses
because that's
actually what the
federal requirements require
you can't do some of the things
that you've given us the ability
to do through our state program
so 65000000 is a big
left wing when you
kind of put it next to our $50000000
program so we're looking
at retooling
a portion of that
65000000 we think
probably 15 to
20 will stay in venture
capital but that
the other questions
45 to 50000000 will
get moved over into
these 2 other programs
so we're.
Going to be bringing rules
for New Mexico
finance Authority oversight
committee in early
October to help
us implement some of these programs
so we can apply to treasury to get
those dollars
reallocated.
On page 12.
Tell you what I've already told to
credit tightening is happening
in New Mexico it
has been since the Great
Recession there's
fewer tools available for
New Mexico businesses
to get their capital needs
met and
the that critical
gap what
we called no man's
land on that
chart is the
place where most
the can larger than
most CDFI loans
made and smaller than
is either is probably
economically viable for many
banks to makes a between
350000
we we had
a sense that that was going to happen the
research came out that way and
again we didn't do the research we
had someone else do it and we
didn't inform their research or
their put forth any
hypothesis but
it did in fact tell us what we
thought we already knew instinctively
which is that's where the capital
is needed we've
been talking to banks
credit unions and CDFI
is about the programs that
we want to put forth to help
them
that plug those gaps
to help them.
Make those loans more
affordable to do risk
those loans and to
make them alternately much
more business friendly
for them
so we'll look again at the loan
is a patients that was the
end our entire offering
back in 2011 was alone
participation
so we intend to
dust that often do that
program again it was successful
it just was short lived because we
ended up not recycling
the loan dollars into other
loan participations but
instead moving it over to
venture capital
and then what we're calling it that
capital access program is the
technical name for the
program that we want to operate and
I will spend some time going through
that today but
nationwide from the
1.no program
we found that that was the
most successful way
to help
banks
support those
smaller volume the
smaller loans
in a low
income and rural communities
so it was the tool
that nationwide was
noted from
just be SSD CO
1.now as being
successful in hitting what we're now
calling no man's
land.
On page 13
the low participation is 2
different ways that that can happen
we don't make these loans
by ourselves that is to say there
has to be another
financial institution
participating in
these loans for us to
move forward with them
partly because the federal
government as part of this
SS BCI
requires that there
be 10 private
dollars for
every S. S. B. C. I.
dollar invested.
So I can't do 100 percent
financing with this
unless I have a significant
expectation of follow
on investment like with
venture capital that would be
one I can
do a portion of this
depending on the
product
it'll it'll differ but
participations take
2 different
tracks you can do co
Lente war I make
the loan directly and the
bank makes a loan directly the
bank will have in
this instance you'll see
the bank makes 90 percent of the
funding available
and NMFA does 10
percent and I'm ignoring equity
requirements here just for
ease of conversation
but 100 percent of the bank
financing will come down then to the
bar were in 2 different
loans with 2 different
lenders to different
application processes
and ultimately
2 different loan payments
so that's the way some
of these will work and
for some banks that's just going
to that that's an ease
and efficiency that they're
most comfortable with you
bring a partner into it
then you have to deal with that partner
and your client for the rest of the
term of the loan and for
some they're not comfortable doing
that and so this is one of the
ways that we would be able
to make that work and usually
what happens is that the financial
institution which again will
have the first lien on all the
collateral and the
NMFA would enter into
a of lenders
agreement
so we would be able to
like identify.
Who gets first right at
the capitol help loans might
work out if there's any sharing of
information but we would
do that through an agreement between
the lender and
NMFA.
We did not do any of those in the
first round I would note in S.
S. B. C. I. 1.oh we have
the capacity to do this
all of our loans however
happen to through the
purchased participation
model which is on the
right hand side
in that instance
again 100 percent of the
loan is made by the financial
institution and then we buy
a 10 percent interest
in their loan again ignoring
equity but basically
of the loan they're making we
own a portion of it so
the loans that come in we
get our 10 percent split
of the loan payment the bank
takes in the the low
payment and sends us money
in that instance there's one loan
agreement there is
one loan payment there's
one application to the
bank and that's
and we then work directly with the
bank to make the rest of this
work so that
is a little easier for our
clients
because they're not dealing with to
lenders and so I was happy to
know that in the first
S. S. B. C. I. 1.oh we
were able to make it work through
participation
like that
and with the federal dollars
in particular it was very easy for
us because we could either do them as a shared
lean
or we could do it with
a subordinated interest
and that just makes dollars go
a little further same collateral
available bank.
On page 14 these are the
terms we used in the S.
S. B. C. I. one program
I won't spend too much time I can go
back and
and answer questions if you
have them but generally speaking
we're the program was set up
to leverage the tend to
one so the
shorter the loan period
the more likely we could read
landed to hire our participation
could be if the bank
wanted a partner for the long term
10 years or more we're
doing 10 you know we're doing 10
percent Max so that really
is it was all
structured because we had
that's this 10 to one leverage
requirement that we needed
to make so if it's a short
term loan we could do a lot
more than if it was a long term
that's really and you'll see that we
had differential
terms for
businesses in rural communities
because they have less access to
capital so you'll see
that we have them both their
rule terms either at
the shared lean or subordinate
lien and then we had
urban at a shared
or
subordinate.
The new program the one that I'll
be bringing to the oversight committee
in early October is
this capital access we're calling
our pooled loan guarantee
fund and
in that instance what we're able to do
is use the federal dollars
to build a
limited
guarantee fund within each
lenders
books so for the
duration of the program
when they enroll
NMFA will
review the
lender will look at
who is actually
making this loans will look at
their
financial reports to their
regulator we will
look at other
back office and will
say yes we have we
believe you have the capacity to
operate this
loan
efficiently effectively
responsibly.
Once their rules
each loan that they
make that fits our guidelines
and again we want to hit those
targets will go less than
100000 obviously we'll go
more than 250000
but those targets of
less than 500000 to be
the real
she for sure we
would be able to
make a contribution
from the federal dollars
into that law loan loss
the fund into that
pooled guaranteed
Fund at their institution
they'll match those dollars
and the bar will put some in
as well so they'll
they'll a mass in their own
financial institution
this pooled guarantee
fund that if
any of their rules loans go
sideways and they have
to they end up
having a loss they can
dip into that
pooled loan guarantee
fund to make themselves
whole so we're using
federal dollars
those matches will go somewhere
between 4 to 7 percent
depending on the size and location
of that business
and its underlying characteristics
if we think it's been a disadvantaged
bar where they
may either
have a higher amount
or maybe they will have
less of a contribution they have
to make those are those are
things were working through right
now but
ultimately somewhere between
4 and 7 percent of each
loan will be
contributed to this guarantee
at the end of the
program.
After all the losses
are
sorted through if there are
any then the dollars
come back to
NMFA and to the state
of New Mexico so the capital
doesn't state in
the lenders institution
it comes back to the back of back
to the state for them
to operate and what the
status but the.
The founders that this is
the way that you help de risk
the smaller loans
that is one of the most effective
ways to do it then you
can't really you can't do it was state
dollars not with not New
Mexico so you have to use
those federal dollars this
provides this S. S.
BCI 2.no
provides us with a real
opportunity to
hit that no man's land in a way
that doesn't exist in New Mexico
now and and absent
other federal funds I'm not sure
how it would get hit so we're really
excited about that
particular process
and I would note that it's also
business friendly there
isn't a separate application to
NMFA there
isn't another review
process of the loan we
look at each loan make sure it hits
the targets that they said it would hit
so we're doing a
quality check for against
our rules but once
they've made that loan we
can then put our contribution
and so they that meets the
timing needs of the
lenders
NMFA's a big organization
our board only meets once a
month if it's
like the loan participations
literally have to get approved
loan by loan by our
board we
think that's what's required when we're taking
on that kind of risk and for that
size of loan but
here it's a
different target and so
again we we think
this will be a little more even more
business friendly that are low participation
allows us to be.
And then on that last page
2 to see them side by
side.
Low participations because
there's construction lending and there we
could be this bill
the total loan amount could
be as large as 7 hunt
7.$5000000.
We don't think we'll see very many of
those but it's possible
with construction lending
for the project to be relatively
big and for us to be bought out pretty
quickly and capital
access again what
we're looking at part shorter
term loans more
working capital loans we're
not talking about
construction of facilities we're
not talking about
those kinds loans were time but working
capital to get those businesses
to grow which is what we provide
those moms and pops needs
so that's what we have here is
just a side by side of what would be able
to offer through the expanded
program again we
think will have about 45
or $50000000
to direct to these 2
programs because we believe
will hit those study and
yes be targets that
give us that let that last
$9000000
that's what I wanted to share with you
today so
you got a preview of what
our our
oversight committee will be looking at in
early October
no spoilers don't tell anyone
else
because we we want to unveil
the international but no
madam chair I apologize I'm I'm
done know that that's a
lot that's a lot on
our plates and it's
I think overwhelming in over
stimulating at least from
my perspective but I
appreciate what you're what you're doing and
I think there's some ideas
that this
committee certainly appreciates
and and wants to know more of I know
Senator Griggs wants to ask a
question
if I may go first
what are the plans to just to
get the capitol access
information to small businesses
because.
I'm thinking of the small businesses in
my district in southern New
Mexico
and
I think we could do
better I think many of our departments
can do better to get
information to our small
businesses and I'm thinking
of you know a local
bakery we've got a local
brewery that still trying to
repair after
fire
you know I I I I I
there are things that they need to
know that I don't know if they're
aware of at these levels so can you
tell me if there
are like plans
to to get that information
out for small businesses
absolutely at the point at which we
actually have a program so
again pursuant
to sweat for a loan
our. Program
rules have to be approved by our
oversight committee and by our
board so we have a dual
process will
be working to get those
rules approved
that'll put us in the position to
then apply to the treasury to
redirect the dollars
from the venture capital program
once we have that though will be
working first with our
lenders are
CDFI as credit unions
and banks to get them to
understand the program
and the intent and mission of the
program the mechanics of
it and start to get
them enrolled and then
we'll do a bigger
push and we have I
think
between our
recovery efforts
and our partnership with the economic
development program chambers of
commerce we've developed
a pretty good mailing
list and methodology for
getting information
into small business to the
hands of small businesses
we'll start with lenders will
also work through the chambers of
commerce and our direct
mailing we've social media
so we're prepared to do a big roll
out at the point at which
this is actually ready to be
announced okay thank you
for that do you have a a
time line on that.
But I I know that some of it is
based on the federal government
so could be who
knows madam chair my
expectation would be
that if we can get
these rules approved in
October and get an
application filed
by the end of October
we should at the beginning of the
year have an approval
from the department of
treasury and then we can start
working with the
lenders
Act you know what
you need to have an rules under
first year and that's the
most important part
because we're not making these
loans directly
so once we've been
able to do a push I would
expect by this by spring
we'll have
the infrastructure by that I mean
the lenders network
set up and ready
to be successful so
my expectation of spring we
be in a position to start making
these small
of these capital access
programs available
thank you I appreciate that I have
colleagues in southern New Mexico
and in my capacity
as the CEO of the green chamber would
like to be able to get that information
out so thank you for
that with
Senator Griggs and representative
Duncan so Senator
X. your your
first.
Thank you madam chair and
and Marquita thank you
for their show we have
to wait a
presentation the
other day almost
back in Los crucis
talking about
public banks
and one of the saying the
public bank presentation
did was a identified
no man's land
for the they talked about
no man's land it
appears as
the company that you've
used here
net street
has more accurately
identified
where the issue this
no man's land
is and
the the program
did. That
you've been talking
about
will be one that can
target
that.
That spot
now. To be
clear I guess and
the the money
is all federal money
and we administer the money
is that correct.
Madam chair that's the current proposal
we think that would be the most effective
use of the federal dollars
and and madam chair
Marquita.
I don't know have there's a way
to fund that
state which
state
dollars.
Or is there I mean because
that the anti
donation clause gets in the
way of different things
does it does it
create a problem here
or is there a way to
fund some of this with state
money. Madam
chair the capital access
program that pulled loan guarantee
fund we haven't
had we
have David Buckel's from the roadie
firms the firm that's working on those
rules that will be presented to the
oversight committee
we haven't had him do the analysis
about whether state dollars could be
used
because we have these federal dollars
available to us we know
that state dollars can be used for
loan participations
because we've operated that
program since 2006
with you know 5.$1000000
it's a small program
but we do know that state
dollars can be used for the
loan participation we
haven't had him look
at the
whether or not they could for the capital
access
but I think my our
instinct is that we would not
want to operate with the state dollars
we would want to use the
federal dollars for that
purpose.
And madam chair Marquita I can
and I can understand that as long
as the federal dollars are
available
sure I think it would be if it's a
program that we
we believe and
ultimately it's
something we may want to
consider.
Determining how we could
how we need to carefully
address using
state dollars
for what we need to
do to use state dollars
because the I mean anti
donation clause just
it. It kind
of gets in the way of us want to
do lots of things but it also
protects us from
doing things we might
not audited but
madam chair I'm I'm
I'm glad that
the the audience
here has heard
this too
because when Marquita talks
about getting that out
to the banks
will Carol's buttons
restaurants may be
maybe some of those entities
that that
could apply
and so knowing that
the H. here will be good
for for
caroling you to
to talk about hal
maybe their their
membership could.
Could to get with
their banker their
credit union
potentially and
determine if that loan is
available there
so that I think all in all madam
chair that's a that's a
good that's a good
program it takes care
or addresses some of
the some of the concerns
raised by the
Public bank
folks and
with the programs that you see
that NMFA
does.
Yeah but it's going to be interesting I
think when we when we
can get the public bank
people the bankers and possibly
even. NMFA
together as a as a
whole to just
see where any
possible benefit
because I struggle seeing a
benefit in in a
in a public bank but I want
to make one other quick comment
about staff for the
for the body.
Can you show all the things that
the
the financial authority to as one
of the things you she's water project
I.
You see also the water trust
fund the hear the water trust
board
the water Trust Fund puts
money into the water project
fund last year
we put $100000000
into the water trust
fund over and
above what would
normally go in there
that allows for potentially
more money to flow down to the
water project fund
NMFA in their
administration of
the water
project funded finding
that entities
who
borrowed money or
gotten grants or loans
through the frontier
are now facing
shortfalls
because of increase in
cost
and and
other things.
We should consider
supplementing the water
project fund
this year in
order to help
that out
but also potentially
provide more money
to the water project
fund to the
van make more
loans and grants
to communities
that are in need because
we know we got more water
projects that
we have money
show if we could do that that might
be helpful so thank you
for that but we say that madam
chair and hopefully that that's something
we can move forward.
Thank you so much Senator Griggs and just to
give you some of that
kind of some contacts there
Marquita well
we're in Los crucis we did have a
conversation a presentation
from the public banking
folks and
from that really
kind of resulted in that we needed
to have a panel to have more discussion
this committee really wanted to get
a lot of answers and
so you
know I'd written even I think
many of us were on the same page
because I'd written to Erin
we need to invite Marquita
to prove to participate
in that panel so
if you are available
on the morning of October
13 at
Erin will follow up with you but I would
like to extend that invitation
because I think that's where we
see where
there might be gaps and what needs
to be filled in what's already being
addressed in so your your input
on that would be really grateful
for that if you are able to
participate.
Madam chair if I'm not able
to all certainly make certain
that someone from NMFA's
there we've got the woman that's
operating our
venture capital program them
she's got a social impact
investing background and she's been
working with all of
our new programs to make sure
that we are hitting the targets
of that New Mexico
the the big targets
of underserved
businesses and how we
can best
do that so I'll if I'm not
available all certainly ask her to do
it great thank you so much and
Erin will be following up with
information but I wanted to get that on your
calendar thank you so much
Representative
Duncan.
Thank you madam
chair.
Thanks for the presentation
mistrustful like I think it was
great
I have a couple questions
concerning
city
businesses
Representative Allison I
probably represent the bulk of
the people who lost their jobs at
San Juan and the
mines so
what determines
distressed and
can you tell me what.
If we might
be part of that.
Madam chair I would have to look at
the census tracts these are
the data that
of the federal government
put together so they tell
us which census tracts
are did our distrust or not
but they're targeted investment
areas technically
speaking from
of the community development financial
institutions so there's a number
of factors there including
unemployment
and demographic
information so I
can't tell you what makes that
up but it is what the
treasury used in
order to
determined by area
by census tract the
disadvantaged community.
Thank you madam chair
could can you tell me
how I can find that
manager follow up with you on
that okay thank you thank
you if you could if I may
any any responses go ahead
send Erin Erin we'll get to the
rest of the region thank you
Representative
next question I have is on the
Cole ending participation
with.
The borrowers
has specifically the
equity that
that borrow just to come up
with we're talking about
a group of folks that
can't early get a
loan.
How are they going to come up with that
equity and and is there
any.
In the the
way that this
that.
Can be in the loan itself
or is that still I
know when I get on I'm
and and I'll tell you right
now. Going
to banking right now is
the are there days I want to
shoot myself
it is.
Anyway.
So and I can
imagine somebody that
can't get a loan
to other markets for the most
part or doesn't have the
funds
to get that
loan.
How do they come up with that equity
portion.
So madam chair I would note that these
2 more these are 2 different
products for 2 different
markets typically
the loan participations are going
to be for a long the
company is probably a
little more mature has more
assets or more revenues
generally speaking
the equity requirement
will vary based
on how much
collateral is there because
again we have
collateral requirements as
well we're mission lenders
we're primarily
looking at the
cash flows that are coming
through but we also need to
make certain that in the
event of a disruption of that
cash flow that
there's you know
some ability
to be made whole by
the collateral that exists there so
they have to be secured loans
and we do we you know we
use
but we
are.
We are low who less
conservative I think than
bankers because again they have
regulators that we don't we're
not a regulated entity
so we can take a higher
loan to value requirement
if there is enough collateral
value there we may be able to get
away from the equity
requirement if there's
not that's when the equity
requirement would come and so it really
is getting to
what's available from a loan
to value perspective
to make our look of
loan work
thank you Mr
so can
you put that into some numbers
committee are we talking
you know as I'm at the bank
now they want
20 percent of
for a large loan
that that I was
working on now the band and it because
it is I do want to pay the interest
so is it
20 percent is a 15
can you get away with 10 percent
for. So
madam chair if you're an existing
business and have some equity in
your that the building already
and you want to expand that building
for instance you would be
able to shrink that equity
requirement there you
know we I think we're
90 percent loan to value on
a building again we're mission based
lenders and we're looking at cash
flow but we still
have to make certain that we
have enough
interest to equal
our enough collateral
available to each will
our low participation
but will do a 90 percent loan to
value on those buildings
were most banks
are you know depending on the asset
are going to be somewhere between 65
and 80 percent so
will help shrink that to start
with by participating in the
loan at a different collateral
level so that the bank
sees us as equity
but it's not actually coming
from the borrower so that's
that's the niche we're trying to hit
their. Thank
you Mr so what about
those in the in
I guess a different in
a different
loan that
have.
That much equity
in the 0 that no man's
land let's take it that no man's
land Madam what
we do for those who madam chair in those
instances the bank is going to make the
loan it's going to make we're
not getting involved in the
loan in I mean we're gonna
make sure that they're not charging
rates that are
unreasonable we are going to
look at the interest rates we're gonna
look at some of the other lending
requirements to make certain
that they are reasonable
loans in addition
to do they have the targets
we were trying to hit but they're
making the loan the bank
the state credit union the
CDFI the
loans they make are the are their
loans we're
we're just contributing
to that pooled loan guarantee
fund to make it to de
risk that loan
to incentivize them to
continue to make those
loans.
Thank you Mr chairman my
concern is it that no man's
land is still gonna be no man's
land
because if at the end of the day I
have I have
$1 and it
takes me $1
26 to get into
the business that I want to be
in.
You know I've I've exhausted all my
savings I've exhausted all of
my family's land let
me all they're gonna let me and so I
I still fear we're going to be
in that no man's land is still
going to get a table for a lot
of folks so
madam chair I I couldn't agree
more this these are
2 tools
will have some venture debt
tools will have some
other
tools available to hit
that same market but
we're going to have to solve it
from many different ways
it has to be approached with as
many resources as
possible because what you've
identified is
the no man's land though
it's got one name is made up of
many different parts
and so no
one tool is going to solve
this in
the chair and I agree with that I think
there's a buy in on everybody and
and for some it's very
small for others it's you know
can be quite a bit different
so thank you
thank you ma'am.
Thank you so much are there any other
questions from the panel.
I'm sorry yes Representative SS
I have you down my apologies no problem
thank you madam chair
thank you are you
thank you for that presentation.
I missed a big part of it I had
to go helps start a
subcommittee and the other
in the other committee room so that we
could
get quorum and
but but I've been listening in
and stuff and so
couple questions that I have madam
chair I
was just kind of scanning
through the
presentation that you've given us
here and you talked
about.
And I don't want to dwell
on this but I just saw that
your your loans
were are
bank loans.
In 2007
we're half.
Of what they were in
22021
can you explain that because I I
I think they had to do
with COVID
funds coming into this
building
spent at a
higher rate than the
normal could you give me
another explanation other than
that. Madam
chair thank you so the credit tightening
happen for a number of reasons
the there are there
are fewer banks
just start out there are fewer
banks or credit unions are
financial institutions so there was
some consolidation
in the financial industry
so that's 1 of the reasons that
that that that's happening
there are more bank
regulations on
each of the loans it makes
and so the regulatory
environment has changed from
2007 that's
another reason so
the combination of those
things I think is leading
to a lot of the issues
in addition to the things that
you've mentioned so it
the the tightening
started you
know in 2008 2009
and the Great Recession period
and and it just got
compounded with other issues
so there's a number of
things contributing to that
tightening I think madam
chair I think
part of that was
the it at
that time obviously you
have that the Great Recession but
you had also Dodd Frank
they came in and changed those
rules would you agree
with that madam chair madam
chair yes and I
think madam chair some of the
the shrinking when you say
shrinking of of
banks is that banks or
branches.
Madam chair madam chair branches
okay so I think the
the drinking of of of
branches we've been
I was on a bank for
for a number of years
and in that
time and before that
and so I know that that was
that that is happening
not.
Primarily because people are
starting to do online if you just
walk into a bank anymore
he used to be an institution you
walked into a into a
building you took care
of your your your finances
there you walked in you part personally
major deposit you
withdraw your money there
that said no longer and we
we anticipated that
many many years ago
the people are going to go online and we
knew that our branches we're going to
we're going to we're gonna
have a big portion of people
just net not walking in the
bank anymore and
so the reduction in
branches didn't have
anything to do with the landing it
was more of that
you know as as a
as a entity
in order to
there's no need to have a
physical building everywhere
anymore so the track
the ranches down
now. Madam
chair.
I was I was listening
and and so forth how does
this differ from a
USDA loan
we're they're guaranteed
what you're talking about those are
federal programs and I'll
just to the south I don't drag this
on he got SBA
USDA how does this
differ from that.
Madam chair the
USDA and
SBA
have to be very successful
guarantee programs the
USTA's the business and
industry and
SB is the 78
guarantee and banks
if they are comfortable making
those loans and again if
the you don't find out what you're going to
get until you
actually have a loan that's gone sideways
and you want to make sure that your
documentations perfect
so if you are a custom
to doing those loans
those are really great tools
if you're not you do have
some documentation risk
just generally speaking in
making 78 and
would just entering into those
programs
but those are guarantees
of loans made by banks
this is a
loan
participation
of. Kind of a
self insurance fund almost
I mean it's it's a limited guarantee
from our perspective but
here there will actually
be
money advocating in
a lot loan loss reserve
fund that's funded
partially by the federal dollars
and by the lender
and by the
borrower and so that
loan loss guarantee
fund
is you know real
it could cover 100
percent of a loan
that's gone sideways after
liquidation
you know it's whatever as
long as it's in rules loan
it can cover any of the
losses of rules
loan that a
lender
takes on so
it's just a different tool we don't
have anything like this just doesn't do
put Kate loan participations
it doesn't duplicate the
collateral assistance
program operated by the
environment economic developed
apartment it doesn't
the that doesn't
duplicate the
guarantees it is one more
tool and again
getting to my point earlier
madam chair it's going
to have to take a number of different tools
and ways in which to fill that
gap and if I left
with an impression that banks
are doing what they're supposed to do
I've been I've left you with the wrong
impression it's
this is a very
difficult
size of a loan to
make just from an
economies of scale
perspective they are
difficult in this branches are
shrinking it's getting that
much harder to oversee
loans of that size
so I really want to make sure
you hear me say that
it's not because I think
banks aren't doing what they're supposed
to do it's because
it's hard for
banks to do this and
operate the business at their end
so I really want to
underscore that
that message
madam chair I think
in in banking
they're just you you
mentioned and I'm a first of all I want to I want
to market I love what
you're trying to do I
I do don't don't take
this and I'm just trying to tear apart
your your deal I think what
what we need to know for for
us that in in in
finance we're trying to get
a loan that
banks are Tools so
there's there's larger
banks and you you you
kick can agree with me on
that there's different types
of banks right you have your
larger national
banks will
call the wells Fargo's as to
the type of and then you have your community
banks and those you see
those are doing a
lot of USDA just
be a type
anywhere 90 percent
90 percent
is is guaranteed
to the lander that
it won't as long as it meets that
criteria and then you've
got things like credit
unions that fall under a different
category that
you do more they do more of
loans and and
home type
mortgages and stuff like that
and so I
think and I
think madam chair our biggest
obstacle here
as a as a as a
business guy that I try to
help my community
and stuff and other business
you know maybe new
starting businesses I
think that but our biggest problem
is
understanding their
financials
how do.
How to cash flow.
I think the many
businesses could do a lot
better they get their
their long term short term debt
out of whack and their
cash flows just starts choking
up and in your
you're not in because you understand what I'm
talking about and I
think
financial
that literacy
is the key to a lot of
this in in
knowing how
do
how to leverage yourself
in you know I've I've got a degree in
accounting and and of course
might just might just
general business background and
I think that makes a big difference and
I I've seen
people that are making
substantial amount of
money but
are not
run it's like it engine
that's not tuned
up and you just
make a few adjustments and all
of a sudden they're like I can't believe
it but it's just a matter of
of refocusing those dollars
in those and your debt
loading it in different areas
and and so madam chair I know that
you want to move on but I just
I think our community banks
are doing a great job I think
I I appreciate what you're trying to
do I'd I'm trying
to to grasp and I I want to
do this offline you and I and
I on on
how we
get that loan participation
because it when you say loan
participation you're talking about a
pool of money similar to
kind of like a USDA
somewhat
but participation
to me when you say
participation
means I'm going to
piggy back part of
this this
loan is that what I'm understanding
madam chair chair
with a low participation
the bank typically is making
the loan and we're buying part of
it got right so we're lowering
the interest rate most probably
were flying down some of the risk of the
bank
but that's in a low
participation were literally
buying a share of that loan
we have an interest in the loan yes
ma'am all right so
madam chair I'm gonna finish with
I think we're going to
continuously have
these issues
so long as we don't focus more
on financial
literacy and
having of
robust
economic development.
Small business
education where they can come
in and sit down and have
someone help them with their cash
flow I think there's
many business
to get themselves you agree
with that madam
chair I think we
if until we get that under
control we'll never
solve it because
Dodd Frank changed
a lot of rules and I remember
1 of my last meetings
and at when I wasn't on the
bank board I said
there's I was a guy that used
to wash their car wash the
the the some of these board
members cars
11 and and
the only reason that I was sitting in
that chair his
because I
worked. With
the bank with a community
bank and
and maybe they
they allowed.
Us through a partnership
because that's really what you're doing
and in starting your
business to expand
and grow and be a
person that later on sat on the
board with him and so
we I said this is going to
be the Dodd Frank is
going to be the end of the guys that started
like me out washing
cars
working and and
and through set sweat
equity getting to where
we're at and so
we can.
Turn some of that back madam
chair but it has to
be through financial literacy
thank you madam chair.
Thank you Representative and and we
also have Representative Allison if
I can clarify just
there are organizations
that provide all of that the
small business development center
there's west
there's chambers
of commerce there city economic
development departments and I think
the challenge is to
make sure that those businesses know that
those resources are available
and you know that's the
challenge that we have it and
at not only the state
level but also in our individual
communities and I think
that's been kind of the on going threat
is that we need to do better to make
sure that information gets out
there because it isn't until
there's a crisis or catastrophe
that businesses are really kind of forced
to try and find that when
they're already at the
time trying to keep their business
afloat in a crisis
and then having to learn about
all these resources that are
available that
they they could have been aware of
beforehand so I think
that's kind of the the ongoing
thing is that we're identifying these
needs and hearing from
businesses
I'm with with services they
need to thank you so much for
that representative representative
Allison.
Thank you madam chair
of a question that I have
this kind of broad
and I don't know if it can
be answered in
just a few sentences
I'm referring to here
slide on program with
thorny. Of
under
50 behavioral
health capital fund
and also the behavioral
health capital funding
act to me
those titles sound
like it's a fund
that replenishes itself
or you don't need any
legislation or
bills or anything like that
to allocate money to it it's
always there
and my question
is
how are we monitoring
or are we
monitoring what
the behavioral health
of of
secretary of
our citizenship is
doing are they doing
enough the
reason why I'm asking
is some
of the problems that we're
trying to address
especially in the urban
areas at this time
our.
Always.
Right more bills
or throwing more money at
it and sometimes that's
not the case the
problems that we
have I
believe some of them
they can be solved if
we get to the root
of the problem it
seems that at
times we are
always going after the
problem trying to solve it
by throwing more money
at it or making more
legislation but
we don't seem
to try to get
to the root of the problem
if we had
and if we knew how much money
was being allocated to that
behavioral and mental
health areas
I think we could solve
some of the problems that we're trying
to solve by legislation
how can we find
out how that
money is being used and
where is it being
used and what
can we do maybe
that's a question to my colleagues
as well what can we
do to make sure that we
get to the root of the
problem without
imposing more laws and
regulations.
Thank you madam chair those are
what loan funds
and so they do revolve
over time but I
know that in that particular
program
2.$5000000
was allocated to
it
1015 die
actually 18 years
ago
and so you know we've made some
really good loans but
2.5 doesn't go very
far and at that
time only bricks and
mortar and equipment
could be utilized the funds could
be utilized only for those things
last year through Senate bill
for 23 Senator
Rodriguez carried a bill
that allowed us to
use that
program the primary
care capital fund and
child care revolving
fund of
use those funds for working
capital needs as well
so what we found during the pandemic
was that the cost of labor
was going up and that what
bank what these
institutions needed was
working capital to bridge
until they were getting more reimbursements
in we don't have tools
for that even if we had the money
we didn't have the authority
so the the low stature
changes that you all made last
year through Senate bill 423
fundamentally
changed how we
can affect the
success of
behavioral health child a
child care in primary care
providers so
we're in the position
now to ask you for
money we weren't asking you
for before because it
the issue was not
Dixon mortar the issue
was they needed working
capital more than anything
else and so
we will be back asking
for funding for those 3
program so that we can have the
kind of impact that
you hoped we would have when the
laws were passed.
Okay thank you for
that
miss Russell and the thank
you for that the madam
chair.
Thank you very much Representative
I obviously this this
committee I think every person who
presents and just to
let you know Sir at this point is
a lot of questions are very
curious
and so I'm always grateful
for the comments that come out of this
and just the the wanting
to have those questions
answered and thank you for
being willing to do so and will be
reaching out to you because we're working
on that panel I think that would be really
important for you to be part of that
conversation for the
Easter Department to do that
so thank you very much
we're only about 30 minutes
behind schedule I try not to
let us do that any more than
that so we have served
with the S. who is the deputy
division director from economic
development
thank you very much
Sir for being
here.
I appreciate that
greatly
we are
scheduled to start
launch so we're only actually
15 minutes behind
for you so I do appreciate you waiting
around we do try to be respectful of our
time
and so I'm gonna let you go ahead and
and do your thing and work
your magic and and we'll
have some questions for at the
end. Thank
you madam chair and members of the committee
thank you for
inviting EDD to
present on our programs here
today and thank
you for for welcoming me I
will sure that this is my very first
time presenting to
an interim committees I'm excited
to to 0 by
we were actually pretty
I know this that this is a
a friendly environment
here and I appreciate that thank
you I will share
as much as I
can
with the knowledge that I have and
if there's anything that I can't
answer I will
follow up and find the answer
for you
so.
Again thank you my name is Sergey
yes I'm the deputy division
director of the economic
development division of the
economic development
department.
And our
of acting
cabinet secretary John Clark
does sent his regrets he would have
like to have come to this
committee but he is
traveling internationally
right now and wasn't available
so.
We were asked to give
the committee a highlights
on 3 of our
purpose of
the job training incentive program
J. to the New Mexico
mainstreet program
and creative industry
and any other highlights of
related to rural
initiatives and so we've put together
presentation that addresses
those interests as well as some
other things that we're
doing
within the department so
I will jump right into
us lied to is need
to and
I'll share that I was
when I started out at the economic
development department I worked in the need to
team and I was the program manager for
many years that's near and
dear to my heart
so that just
I'll give a quick overview about what
J. tip is and then some highlights
on the job training incentive program
is a poser I'm sorry to interrupt
can you point the Mike a little
more towards use sure so
that we can hear you and also on the without
a little better that's perfect thank you
thank you so the
job training incentive program
was established in statute in
1973
it's been around for about
51 years
and
it's an incentive program that
provides.
An offset to the
cost for
training newly
hired
individuals and newly created
positions and qualified
companies and that is
done through
awaits reimbursement for a portion
of the training the national training
on the job anywhere from
2 to 6 months.
And so that base
reimbursement rate
ranges from
50 to 75 percent
depending on the company
locations so
in urban areas is 50
percent in rural it's
65 and then as you get
out into the frontier
areas.
It's 75 percent
frontier as
we as
the need to board has defined it
is
and.
A community with a population
of 15000 or fewer
outside a metropolitan
statistical area.
It also includes
any
native American or
tribal
land location
and the
federal designated colonias
in the southern part of the
state.
J. tip opens up the
eligibility for a couple
of different tax credits
the highway General job tax
credits
and there's
a bullet here related to
customize hurting at higher education
institutions
that I'm gonna go into a little bit on
the next slide related to
to policy
but that's.
A contribution of up to $6000
per trainee for companies
that are partnering with higher ed
institutions to create a
customized training
program for their
new employees
need to can help offset the
cost of delivering that
customized training through
the higher it
institutions.
Date of staff.
Determines eligibility and works
with companies to strategize
their application
for day to funding
that aligns with
both the monthly
need to board meeting and then they're
hiring.
The plan so that
the project is
approved before they begin
hiring and then they
have the authorization to
go ahead and and start their hiring
and as
they train their folks
up and complete
the authorized
training hours than
their
allowed to submit
claims for reimbursement
for a portion of those
wages and so it is a performance
based
methadone
where the companies are prepared
to create the jobs
pay their employees and
then
request reimbursement for a
portion of those wages that
it intends to
offset the cost of training those
folks well
there.
At lower production levels
as their learning.
The day tip program
is administered by EDD
and the need to staff it
is governed by a board
of directors that's
legislatively.
Created and so
they are made up
of a variety of
state
governments representatives
as well as private
sector and
organized labor
so they
take.
The recommendations of the department
for those projects and
make all of the funding decisions
at their monthly board meetings
there held every Friday
at the second
Friday of every month
and they are currently
since comment on line
and virtual so anyone it's it's
an open meeting and anyone who's
interested to observe
a need to meeting it's really
great to
see all of the things that the different
companies are doing throughout the
state and those meetings are
posted on the EDD
website you can tune
in every second Friday of the
month
the data board and
staff also go through an
annual policy making
process where
they review
the the policy in the
rule they
take
public input throughout
the year from the
companies they're working with
communities
even the education
institutions
to think about ways
that they can enhance
the policy to keep up
with the needs of
businesses in our
communities and
so
at the last policy hearing
which that usually happens in the
spring and then the
policy
that's enacted
becomes.
Effective in the new fiscal
year but they
they looked at a couple of things
closely with a couple
of different partners higher
it institutions.
And our partners
with the department of workforce
solutions
and.
Thinking about how we
can encourage our
higher ed institutions and
companies to engage
in customized training
efforts together
it is an aspect of J. tip that
is not highly
utilized
and.
Particularly we find that
the companies really
have their own
training
programs
and sometimes proprietary
information that they want to keep
internal but when there's
an opportunity
for
a company to.
At if you
could outsource that
a piece of that to hire it
institutionalized them help them
build that customize
training it's really and
up in
a great partnership and a benefit
to
our students at the heritage and
institutions as well as
our
companies who are hiring
new new folks
so what they did was they looked
at.
The amount that J. tip can
reimburse for each
training for their customized
training needs and it had
not been assessed and.
Probably over 10 years and
so the previous amount
was $2500
per
participant.
And that just
didn't cover the
cost of what the
higher ed institution needed
to build a really
robust customized training program
for a company what they'll do is
they'll sit down with the company
assess what their needs are find
out you know what it is if
it's a very specific thing
on one piece of
manufacturing equipment
or is it a process
or is it a
pathway you know for
for a company
to grow their employees
and a certain skill
set
and so
the board worked
with
Senator higher ed institutions
they took
the.
Input from
C. N. M. and CNM
ingenuity
particularly
and came up
with a new
and and enhanced policy
where they raise
that.
Amount to a $6000 level
so companies who are
either locating in New
Mexico or are established
in New Mexico if they're they're
working are
expanding their operations
and they need to hire
train their
new.
At employees on
their processes their equipment
they can go to the higher ed institution
and say you know
I need a 3 week training
program on this this and
this and they're very agile
they can take what they know
this can pull sometimes I can
pull something off the shelf
and.
Customize it to the company's
needs or sometimes they just build it from
the ground up so
we're really excited that
this policy change
has.
It has been
passed and our
staff is currently
no kind of working to get the
word out about this
this aspect of need to that's not been
utilized in the past
we feel that it it really
just.
Strengthens
the training
is.
Confidence that their company
is providing the best training
that they can for them it
builds you know
retention and then to
that point also
looking at
companies that
have are having trouble
with retention or
just need some
assistance with the
recruitment
maybe H. R. efforts
in the beginning we find that
there are companies
who.
They start up really quickly
you know business owners in the room
no U. Q. got your
business you started and everything
is just go go go and
then. Sometimes
you have to backtrack and think about oh
wait a minute I didn't think
about you know I I have
to deal with these personalities
are or training
or thinking about how
can I retain my
work force and so.
We have a we've
always partnered with workforce
solutions department
we have a representative on our
board on the need to
board who
provides great
input.
And so
the board decided to offer
an added incentive
that for companies that are
utilizing
the various
services of the department of workforce
solutions not just posting the
jobs on the
workforce connection sites
but taking
advantage of their services
and screening applicants
and doing job fairs
hiring events
they have a customized
curriculum
they call it a.
Oh my goodness it's a it's a
professional.
I'm sorry it the phrase
casing but a person on staff
who can also help
divide turn develop
training curriculums for the
for the companies and
deploy those and so
if the companies take the time
and an effort to take advantage of
those services that are for
free to
all of our New Mexico companies
need to pull out an extra 5
percent reimbursement on the
their overall reimbursement so
those.
Really excited about those efforts
and hope to see some more activity
in those in those
areas
the next slide slide
I
highlights just a few
stats related to
J. to projects in the last
fiscal year
20 of the 65 companies
approved were in rural
and rural locations
and they're listed there variety
of of locations throughout the
state
rural obligations of need to
bump total 21
percent of all
awarded funds and FY
23
just over 3.$3000000
and an average wage of
$17.92
35 percent of
the overall jobs
that were approved we're
in rural areas and that amounted
to $380
I'm through internet
jobs.
So now shifting to our main street
program.
Main street is another
of a EDD's flagship
programs it's nationally
recognized as it's been around for
a long long time
and our main
street
programs accredited by
national mainstreet
national
and it's
really focused
in.
Getting people out
into the communities to
provide technical
assistance
to communities
that want to revitalize
their downtown areas and arts and
cultural districts.
I create
thriving places to live
and work and and and
Silvercity is
a.
The gold standard of New Mexico
mainstreet it's they've had a very
successful program for a really
long time and it's
this it's
beautiful.
The next slide shows
you a map of where
all of the main street projects
are located throughout the
state
we have our our
main
main street districts
and then we have arts and cultural
districts.
There are 30 act mainstreet
programs and then we
have a couple
of.
Somewhat new
initiatives that our
focus to support
the smaller
communities
or even.
Small neighborhoods within urban
communities with
revitalization efforts and those
are our
frontier and native
American Community projects
as well as
our urban neighborhood
commercial corridors
projects.
And then mainstreet
has also done some work with
historic historic fear
the restoration including
the so called fear here
and
Silvercity.
So the next slide
gives a list of
just a few
projects that have been newly
added to the main
streets
teams work
in in various
areas of
revitalization
our free of village
is in Santa
Fe.
The village of Cuba city of Espanol
I mean this Red River enter
to this problem are those that are
highlighted here and I won't read
every single detail
about those but
or. Main
street does a really
great job of reaching out
into the very small
communities throughout the state
and making a
great
impact.
The next slide is
about The New Mexico mainstreet
capital outlay program
the last few years
New Mexico mainstreet has been very
fortunate to receive
capital outlay funding most
recently $10000000 for
projects
in their
communities
to for
infrastructure
upgrades.
And so.
You can see the details about
here how they
are scaled
and what they
entail so most of
them are based in
on master
plans.
Cultural or
economic development plans in
metropolitan redevelopment plans
and so
are.
The folks that are deployed
out into the communities we have
10 field
operative operatives if
you want to call them
who provide technical
assistance to all of our main street
communities it be its
architecture
marketing
planning
redevelopment they
will bring their
specialty to the
community and help them
to identify projects
and move them along
in those in those communities.
The next few slides just highlight
some of the recently completed
projects
and you so you can just see
as you thumb through
slide 1011 I
think and
that the
different
varieties of projects that
main street can help
communities.
Along the way they've
got.
Way finding projects they can
do signage
trail you know trail
signage
you can see there's a theater project
there and
at the cover theatre Deming
main
streets.
And then as you get into the next slide
11 the you see some new
projects that are coming up
through the the
pipeline
in Las Vegas Lovington Alamogordo
and the south valley
mainstreet
project.
So more highlights.
From main
street districts and
projects.
Blowing to main street local
innovators Institute food
accelerator program
was recognized by the USDA
rural
development.
For program excellence that they were
very proud of that
and they they really
worked
together to put together
this cohort
to.
Provide the support
that they need for their
local
folks who are interested in
your building that that
industry.
And then this southeast New Mexico
partnership small towns big
fun again.
6 different main street
districts work together
in a regional effort to put to
bring you know tourism
and business into
their towns through these
celebrations and
you know it's been a great
success.
Couple other
highlights we have
the new gateways signs
that a whole Encino and the Navajo
chapter
they were participate
participants of the frontier
and native American
communities initiative
and got some technical assistance
as I mentioned for the for the signage
projects.
Last highlight.
For main street
just wanted to say they they
main street holds
what they call their summer
fall conference
or institutes
each season and so they just
completed the the one in
Carlsbad last week
and got a great turn out but
it's we're the main streets
community folks can
all come together
learn best practices
and talk
about projects
and.
And
policy.
And then as I mentioned are
field reps which
are actually
technically called revitalization
specialists are
folks who find that taken a high
level of technical assistance
to our main streets
both to the the local
main street directors
providing them the support
that they need for their capacity building
as well as
at the.
The programs
overall.
Okay on to
creative industries division so this
one is
interesting to all of us because we're
all learning as this is a very
very new
initiative and division
created with economic
development by the
legislature and the last
legislative session
EDD received
a one time initial
funding amount of
$2000000 to
create the creative
industry division and
so what we
have done to kick
that off is
to
work with a contractors
creative start ups
through an
RFP process they were selected
to help
EDD.
Kind of build a road
map of you know
what the creative
industry division
might look like and how we might
serve those
division so there's a slide on
that as we get a little bit further
down and
then the rest
of the the funding
was
also
we did we did a call for projects
from the local communities themselves
to see what
types of economic and
community development projects
they might identify in their
in their
communities.
In the creative industries
sector and how they
could use that money so.
The legislation
defines creative industries
it's very broad it
includes a lot of
different types of
businesses and you can see those
some of those are listed
here in the bullets
but it's anywhere from
performing arts visual
arts to
marketing landscape
architecture
it you know it could even go
into the.
Like technology
area coating
digital media things like
that. The only
thing that it does specifically
exclude is film industry
because that's funded elsewhere
and so
the mission of
our the creative
industry division
is listed in the
bullets in the next
slide and really
it it is.
Supporting those
industries in our smaller
communities.
Primarily I think everywhere
but I think we we're seeing
that these creative
industry
are thriving in our smaller
communities and rural communities and
so how can we support
them and what resources
can we identify
to provide them what they
need to grow
and expand and thrive
and stay in New
Mexico as well
so
again I won't read all of
those things
they're listed but
that last bullet I just want
to call out you know act as a
liaison between creative industry
related businesses and
organizations that's
really.
What we all do and
all of our our programs and
economic development we want to
be your
liaison between
you know the community and the
resources and help to
make those
connections.
So as I said we we
contracted with creative start
ups they've had just I
think they might even be
in the final stages of of
actually executing that
contract but they will
be getting B. beginning
work very soon
and this is what they're going to be looking
at for economic development
to.
Basically
design a strategy and
plan for this
division
so that we can
deploy it and serve our
our. Communities
in the best way possible so
identifying those needs of
the industry of what are the
gaps what are the
potential resources how
can we
collaborate with our partners
and higher ed business
development tourism
training
what are the training needs
for these industries and how
can we build
those training programs
together
etcetera
and so that
is the focus of this
contract
that will inform
the department is how we how
we grow this division
and then there's there is a bullet
there I'm just saying
we will be requesting
recurring funding to keep
this this going
as we as we move
forward.
The next few
slides
we're are intended to just
give you some more information
about other programs within the
department but we've tried to
put a little bit of overall spend
on so that it we keep with
the same so
Lida I think
most everyone is familiar
with leader of the local economic
development act is
one of the incentives and
grant programs
that the
department administers
there's lots of information there
about its origin
and
requirements at
cetera.
So I'm not going to get really
deep into the the weeds
there but.
You all know it is a
discretionary
Fund as it were a
or a deal closing
fund but it
is intended
to.
Offset the cost of
land building an infrastructure
for companies that are
either.
Locating or
expanding
existing New Mexico
businesses.
What I wanted to really
focus on and they're the next
couple of slides and have explains
what it does and how it benefits
companies
but if we get into slide
21 we'll start talking about
overall projects in different aspects
of leaders so you can
see.
What we we try to do
and economic impact
analysis we
don't try we do
there's an economic impact analysis
done at the beginning of a project
with it which is basically a projection
is taking all the data
and
from the project the
company the
community whoever's involved in the
project
to
create a picture
of not only what the
budget
would be for the company
but also for the
state and its investment
as well for local communities
in this project and
so.
We at
we have an annual process that
we've just started it's
2 or 2 years and
collecting actual data
on follow on
on the projects that are active
to take a look at you know how far
how far are you in this return
on investment for these
projects
and so we've had a
couple of examples
of our our return on
investment meaning what
is returned
to the state you know in
gross receipts tax cap
of corporate income
tax job creation
etcetera.
The next
2 slices kind of highlight some
projects and then I'll get into a couple
other.
Rural specific
items
maxi on solar to that
technologies is a huge
project that's in
Albuquerque.
The first commercial set
scale solar cell manufacture
in the US which is going to benefit
the entire
state.
So area I'm sure
everybody here is that in the
news
electronic caregiver is
a Los crucis
based telehealth
company that has been growing
over the last few years
and.
They've expanded
they've they're gonna be
creating 770 new
jobs and
very decent
salary and annual
payroll that.
Contributes to our you know
our overall economy and
you can see the lead
investment of $1000000
is
enhancing the overall
private investment of
17.5000000
and and we're we're getting
we're getting a
lot.
In return with those jobs and
then just the benefit of
having a good
corporate partner in
the community the
other project is
Intel that's another
one of the big projects everyone's heard about
that expansion
you know I I think our hope
is that that
maxi on project
that just landed is going to be our next
Intel you know and that'll
be a
flagship company
for years to come
and and we hope that that's the
case so those are the things
you see in the headlines all the
time but
and they're impactful and they're
really important
but
the smaller projects
that.
That we get to do in the rural
areas are just as impactful
enough maybe not more so
because you know
I new jobs
or 20 new jobs in a
rural area is
is can be very very
impactful
as well so this is a list on
page 25
of rural projects
that have been recently
approved and and
and acted in rural areas
so we've got the are cook our coastal
wind towers will be in
the lan they just recently
announced building those
huge towers that you see
on this of that are supporting those huge
blades of the wind
towers little toad creek
here in
Silver City syzygy tiles
also in Silver City
syzygy tile has
been around since before my
time and economic development 6
and at that 16 years
my very first need to board
meeting was here in Silvercity
and we got to tour syzygy
tile at that time and it was
just awesome and and it's
so heartening to
see that they're still around and
they're thriving and they're growing
they're successful
and and you can see
noisy Water and Aalto
Franklin Madam packaging
and Senator reset and
then geo group
in all good honesty
Mexico.
Which is another really cool company
they've been here for a long time
Swiss company they
they build
those.
Net so still notes that you see
on the mountainside to hold the rocks
back you see image
you're going up the mountains inTaos
they've been located and although the onus
for many many
years and
their primary
workforce comes from the
Santo Domingo I
off.
So they're going to be expanding their
their foot print there so getting
back to lead a little bit 1 of
things I wanted to mention was
the leader of rural infrastructure fund
which is established in
2020
and since then we've been able to do
a handful of projects
that are really focused
on supporting
publicly
owned
projects within
communities really looking
at.
The industrial parks and trying
to.
Help and bolster
the infrastructure needs
of their
for
companies to be able to
to locate in those
areas and so we've done
a couple of water projects
the Moriarity city
airport
as well as Clovis and
then. The
town of Taos
San Juan County industrial park
most recently and McKinley County
infrastructure development in
their industrial
park.
The next few slides highlight
those bullets that were
on the previous slide about the
different projects in the
area so our Costa
you get all the numbers there
about what
those those projects entail
related to job
creation and
capital investment and
Lita
investment.
When we get to slide 31
it it includes Franklin
mountain packaging but also highlight
some of the projects that have
been
recently done down at the
Santa Teresa border
area.
And then the following slides again
highlight those numbers for all those so
I won't I won't you know budget down
with all those numbers but it's interesting to
see you know
what are those numbers look
like just wanted
to mention real quickly we do
have
and international trade
aspect to our
department
we.
Partner and contract with
the New Mexico trade alliance
to administer
the New Mexico
just be a step grant which
offers small grants to companies
that are interested in exporting their
products outside of
New Mexico and
internationally.
And we also
have for the last
of 3 years I
think 3 or 4 years
EDD has had a
foreign trade office and
Taipei Taiwan and
our as you
know our our governor
is was visiting
there this
week.
Out of that effort to attract
foreign direct investment from
Taiwan we've been
successful and
landing 3 companies
so far that have lowered located in
the border plaques and
are hoping that that will
continue.
One of the newer initiatives
in our department
is our jet I office we always
say that they're the
coolest that
the cut the coolest name and all of state
government
that is justice equity
diversity and inclusion and I
think that we're the first state
agency to actually
stand up an office
for
ETI and
so.
The. The
office is headed by Shani Harvey
and she has
one.
Colleague in that office 3
developed and
it will be soon bringing
on
another
economic
transition.
Person to help
then that office
but.
What the work that they do
is so important because what they're
doing is.
Similar to what our regional
reps do they're out in the community
and working with companies but
really focusing
in on
how can we
serve underserved
populations or populations
that we haven't been able to reach
yet through economic and
community development
and
looking at those minority owned
business owners
and community organizations
and how to make those connections and
provide the technical
assistance that they
need.
This allows us
this work
really.
Allows us to touch a
greater
population in
terms of the types
of companies that we normally
can work with as you all know
economic development incentives
are primarily focused
on economic base
industry meaning those
are companies that
are.
Either exporting a
product or
service to
a client base outside the
state at least 50 percent
outside the state so it's really like
you know manufacturing and certain
business sectors providers
and so some of those
smaller entrepreneurs
and mom and
pop retail type
businesses.
We're just we don't have a
lot to offer them
in terms of incentives and so we're trying
to fight find
ways to.
Provide support in the way we can
again serving as liaisons
making the connections but
also using
what we learn from these
interactions
to.
Take a look at our own
policies and programs and say
how can we enhance and
improve to be
more inclusive.
And so Shani does really great
work they're going to
be
doing a
it's not on the slide if you go to the
website there will be
a.
The workshop one day workshop that's
happening in Albuquerque
and in October and it
will be half day in Spanish
have to in English for small
business owners to come learn
about our
resources
and so if you're interested in
that place take
a look it's on the details are on the
website Sir will there also be
a virtual option on that because
not all businesses can take
off. To
go and write and or
if it will be recorded
a I'm sure it will be recorded
and I'll to find out if it's
going to be a like a
hybrid.
Okay opportunity here I will
get that information back to you for
sure.
I'll think Marquita Russel for
coverings like 36 for me
completely and in detail
in much more detail than I could have
done so again we just wanted
to mention R. S. S. B. C. I.
efforts and the
collateral assistance
program
and the opportunity
enterprise with revolving loan fund
so again Sam Collins is
our contact there at
the department who's overseeing all of
these efforts and is happy to
talk to to anybody about
them.
One of the things that we we
were really really
fortunate
to receive in
our last
budget session
the legislative session was
funding to hire I
knew
regional reps
so our community business
and rural development team
is
commonly known as the regional reps
and we have 6
regions
and we had
6 folks who lived and
worked out in their regions and
you can see the map there
who as I
mentioned before serve as the liaison
between the department
and the community and
all of the resources that are available
and kind of facilitated
projects and provided
technical assistance where they can
anywhere they
can
and so we were able to
basically double that team so
we now have to to regional
reps and most of our
regions.
Who are able to
kind of tag team and
divide and conquer find
more
assistance and so our hope
is that this year that we will be able
to do some more
outreach and and
reach the further corners
of those regions
that we haven't been able to
just because of
capacity time
wind chill time
etcetera and
so they're all listed there Beth
Waltrip who is our one of
our newer regional reps
serving region 3 is with me today
and she's right
here.
Our office of science and
technology has gone through a little
bit of our a re
structure rebranding
it has been an office of
one for many many years
and we have
been fortunate to receive
some.
Additional a
funding so that
we could have not only a director
but on a couple of associates
within that team so
it is now the offices strategy
science and technology
Nora Sackett is
on the director we're
happy to have
a a program
administrator
for the
technology transfer
technology commercialization
area and we will
also be hiring
and entrepreneurship coordinator
zoom and so well we're
really excited about that entrepreneurship
coordinator position
because
we envision that person
working closely not only with our jet
I folks but
with the regional wraps
and
the creative industries as
well kind of connected making all those
connections with the
science and tech and creative
industries.
I'm so very excited about that
one there there's some information
about some funding
opportunities and and that
we've just recently
been participating in but the one
thing I wanted to mention is the C.
pace program
which is a commercial property
assets SS
clean energy program really it's a
financing tool
to access
financing for energy
efficiency renewable
energy
efforts and those
are directed to towards
communities and
so we're
just kind of getting
our office going
with being able to find
some connections and technical
assistance with that
we currently have an R. F. P.
open for
program administrator for that
effort so I think
we'll see more to come for
that but I think that'll be a great resource
for our communities as
well.
The next slide and there's only a couple
more.
Okay you want to give us time to
ask you a question yeah yeah
all of her through these
last ones
just wanted to mention
our.
Office of the secretary
has to economists on
board and they've we've been
very fortunate to have them on board
for the last couple of years one
of the things that they do is they put out
a quarterly
economic summary on every
county in New Mexico
and those are available on our website
and there's just a snapshot of
the type of information that you can
see but allsorts
of economic
data that is really
useful to communities economic
development organizations
and even companies and
of course you all and
your rules as
our
legislators.
The last couple of slides just
highlight some of the the film
productions if it happened in
the rural areas over the last
year or so
the map on slide 41
shows
the uplift zone
which
highlights all of there's
there's a surrounding
area around that
bubble of the urban
part of New Mexico where
I could production companies are
offered an added incentive
to do
their productions in the outlying
areas and not just a long
that that.
Dense urban.
Court R. I think just
to Torio COVID it be great just
to see the rest of the state of New
Mexico as that up
lives on I do
too. One of
the directors
okay there are a lot
of the rural communities that could
benefit from that
no it that's what it is that
the rural communities get the added
incentive.
But the ability zone is the
area and the 2 little
circles no I think it's
the out out of
that so it is I. as in the state
yeah okay thank you for that clarification
sorry I didn't make that
clear. Thank you
yes.
And our
direct iterations that division is
also fairly new
going through a little bit of transition
but they are
within Economic Development
Department they will be
getting a new director
starting here soon
out of Taos and they
do lots of work
with.
The parks
department and creating
trails creating
air outdoor rec
opportunities for rural
areas. Then the
very last slide just give the highlight
of the
agency's budget
request
and really just
to
point out that you know
in order
to.
Be able
to.
Then and
staff a creative industry
division we need
actual recurring funding
to hire people to do that so
that's what we're hoping maybe we
can get
some.
Some new FTEs to help us with
these new divisions and and
issues that have been
graciously granted to us
through
the. New
Mexico legislature.
So
I thank you for listening to me
go through all of those slides
and I'm here to
to answer any questions you might have if
I don't have the answer I'll find it for
you absolutely thank you Sir
I appreciate that and one
of the things we can do
is look
at the economic development page
and we see the 9 different areas
of focus the those
from EDD
and understanding
that there are a
whole lot of and of things
underneath each of those 9 different
components so I appreciate you
doing your best to trying cover those
it's a lot
thank you so you know if
there are questions that
she can't answer shills and
those answers to Erin Erin
Wilson those to the committee
but I do have representative Armstrong
and Representative Lujan
if I may beforehand that we
had a conversation yesterday from
the wine industry
about signage
to highlight some of the different
wineries that we have like
specifically in southern New
Mexico we've got a bunch wineries
along highway 28
and there's going to be the 4 hundredth
anniversary
of the wine industry in
our state and
I'm wondering if that is something
because you've got the signage
projects I'm wondering if that
is something that qualifies
underneath that
under the New Mexico mains and
madam chair under the New Mexico
next New Mexico
mainstreet program I think they they
do have to be related to
an New Mexico mainstreet
district.
But there might be opportunity through
the tourism
department
and I would be happy to.
To take a look at that that would
be all right because I
think you know it with
because we're we're looking
at different things that
bring in revenues to our state and
we've all been talking about ways
to diversify our revenue streams
and such a trying capitalize on
those it's like we really need
to start moving forward with
that if we're if
we're going to do that and
so
tourism it's 1 of those things that we
can bring into our different communities
and I think if we can highlight those
and that gives us community something
to talk about an up left
it's just they need kind of some of the
basic infrastructure to get those
things moving so I would
appreciate that if you're able to have
that conversation it's part of your
busy schedule and really grateful
madam chair absolutely thank you
so much all right we have Representative
Armstrong Representative Lujan and
representative Allison
Representative Armstrong your
first I do
want to point out it's
1220
if we can try and wrap this up by
1:00 we only have 30 minutes
for lunch but I'm I'm gonna put
the challenge to you all
thank you madam chair.
The notice I didn't ask any questions of
the first panelist
anyway.
I was saving that I
figured
thank you so much for your presentation
that your department
carries a a lot
of backpacks the and
different diversity thing
so but I I just wanted
to in out of curiosity
do you think that
the state economic
development works
it do you think it is utilized
best if there's local
economic development to that
can help decide
what needs to be done and then
go through the different processes
do you think that that's
helpful to have
local economic development
to to help
guide that madam
chair and Representative
yes absolutely we
rely on our
local economic
development partners at
in the local government as well
as the private
economic development organizations
to really
inform us of
their needs and how we can
support their efforts in
the communities because
every community is different
and all the
programs are going to work and every
community and so really
working together to identify what
are the needs and what's the
best fit what's that
what are the best resources that we can
bring and
offer is is essential
thank you so much for that answer I
appreciate that so
I know that there is a
an application process for
economic development
certification.
In the areas can you tell me
how many
request you received for
certification sure
yes madam chair
and representative Armstrong
the certified
economic development organization
program as a new program
to EDD
it's we're in our
second year
and it is
designed to
help local
economic local nonprofit economic
development organization so it's
really just that that the
the local EDOs
not the local government
offices
to.
Build their capacity
to.
Perform economic
development and provide those
services in their communities but to
also build a
very professional
organization
that is
equipped
to.
Host.
Site visits from
companies that are interested in
locating in New Mexico
and to support
the company's through business
retention and expansion
that exist in their communities
it's it's really like
a.
Incentive to.
For for professional development
if you were and then offset
those help
to not offset
but
to.
Provide some financial support
to those organizations
that sometimes
don't have a lot of funding
right also so do you know how many
applications you receive sure
there were
last year there
were.
I think 12
applications and 7
were approved and
this year I believe there
were.
I I'm not sure I can give
you the exact numbers but I want to say
they were maybe in line
7 or 9 applications
and there were 4
that were granted this year and how
many of those are in rural New
Mexico.
Or Pasir front
tier they're all in
rural the ones that were
approved this year were
for
Representative tone
I'm sorry I'm gonna have to
dig in here you don't you don't have
yeah but there I just wanna
make sure we had some in rural New
Mexico yes yes and
so you
know I
have a an
entity in my area that's
applied twice and failed
twice.
And and so
the the
regional.
People were not very helpful
at all. In my
district and so
I think it's I think it's
important to know
madam chair that
someone in the community trying
to do something good and keep
hitting brick walls.
Pretty soon they give up
pretty soon they give
up.
And so we really need to take a
hard look at what are we approving
in order we not approving
because. The
person that's in charge of this
and all the people on the board and
this is a 4.
For region area this
is captioned Sapporo
Sierra Sierra and
Valencia part of Olympia
and and we're dying
we're dying a slow risible death
as far as economic development is
concerned and they're doing their
best to to
try to raise us
up and we just kept
keep getting knocked down
so I just need you to be aware of that
and that's not a reflection of of
you whatsoever I just wanna make sure
you know that and
so now we all know the
benefits of of knowing
what's going on in our local
areas and
how.
They understand what what
the needs are the
good the bad the ugly about the area
so I would really appreciate
to know why
a lot more aren't
aren't approved that's one
thing the other thing is
the creative industry
I I had an entity
apply for that and they loved
it it was great everything was
perfect but the
process was a little
overwhelming to them and they and
I was happy to hear you say that
they were doing
there was a
training
madam chair on another
entity was doing a training
on Oct in October
the jet I. Is
doing a training and so I think it would
be helpful because of course
we you know I voted to to
help create this
this department and and
funded but I want
to make sure the money's getting out the
door and that the process
is easy removing
barriers from people
that that can't
apply or have trouble
applying so training
for the people applying would be
really really helpful in the in
the creative industry
part of it that was her
only thing is and they they
really didn't understand
they had to go through a
governmental agency
so they had to go through the the
village or the change you
know they didn't understand
that up front and so that was
it was a little harder
and I told her I said you know it's
because of the anti
donation clause we can't just give
you money so
she understood that after she's like
oh come on Gail
and so then
so that I don't really I mean
I don't really have another question other
than that but the other thing is
the outdoor recreation
love the outdoor
recreation.
I'm all for that but I'll tell
you skiing
hunting and
fishing.
Are not really included in the
outdoor recreation.
And this is it's more about
building trails so that people
can outdoor recreation.
But the way that
we create
income is through
skiing hunting and fishing
those top 3 revenue
producing
outdoor activities in the state of New
Mexico and and it doesn't
seem like the outdoor recreation
department really promotes
that tourism promotes
it more than than anything
and they they probably all
go hand in hand
and then the other one is the recreational
aviation foundation
is really trying to break into New
Mexico and they're having a hard
time and I think that
this should be part of our
outdoor recreation
to me outdoor recreation
is you know at
the right now our moving cattle
that's outdoor recreation is work
but it's also a outdoor recreation
and so I I would really
like to see us include
more activities that
actually our revenue.
Positive
yes hikers and bikers
and things like that they come in the state
and our our campgrounds
I stay in our hotels the Eaton
our breweries
but.
Hunting fishing and skiing
are at the top of those lists and
when we I personally think we just
need to really
promote those and and in
addition to the recreational aviation
foundation so thank you
for what you do I know it's
a lot
and all I ever want to do is
help remove
barriers for people trying to
apply for all of this.
Activity because it does us no
good if it's just sitting in the
bank thank you madam chair
thank you Representative and you bring up some
really interesting points because there
are like
crossovers of where
when you're talking about recreational
aviation
and we're talking about outfitters
who are providing these different
things to our public lands in our
open spaces and just the
activities that we have
is that there
is an opportunity there for
flyovers of
I mean can you imagine a flyover of
the Rio Grande gorge.
And just how gorgeous
and what an experience that would
be Southern New Mexico
we've got Old World War
2 binding
sites
that are part of the organ mountains desert
peaks national monument we have
flyovers that are happening
there in the next
couple of weeks and that we have
outfitters that are bringing
money into our
communities
and supporting local jobs
and so I do
see that is is like a connection
and and and I I hope the
department would too because
it's I mean you've got a lot
on your plate there are a lot of different bullet
points under each of those categories
but I I do think that there's there's
opportunity there because then there
are opportunities for those small
businesses to also apply for
funds through EDD
if they get kind of recognized
as part of this particular
industry.
And we're seeing that more and more
especially as we have a continued
movement of protecting our public
spaces and really highlighting
outdoor tourism and outdoor
recreation which we know
nationally brings in over
$8000000000 into
a kind of these and I have to look
but it's a multi
$0.
Venture in New Mexico
alone thank you madam chair and
also just just to add
on to that in rural New
Mexico outfitters and
guides will
hear later the the logging
industry but
outfitters and guides are
pretty much all there is that in the
school system
and maybe the for
services all thank you madam
chair thank you very much
Representative we have
Representative Lujan and then representative
Allison.
Thank you madam chair and
thank you director
or deputy director for being here
today
so I have a.
Like Representative
Armstrong a few questions
so I'm just going to dive into it the
first thing I'm gonna go to is on page
38
when you say Mexico
is a first for 2 major federal
funding awards and won the
department of energy regional clean
hydrogen hubs western
Interstate hydrogen hub
how do we accomplish
that when we are still an application
process for the hydrogen hub
for the
what state.
Madam chair.
Madam chair and Representative Lujan
we are in the finalists
stages of
that.
Grant opportunities so it hasn't
been finalized we've just learned
that were we've
got we're still in the running
we have been cut yet.
Okay that makes sense.
Okay so to the language
sure suggests that we've already
been awarded Sir
thank you for that.
It says federal funding
awards right
there so we're New Mexico is a
finalist for 2 major
funding federal work so yes
you're right it does it is a
little bit misleading thank you for the
clarification I appreciate that
okay then I'm gonna
go for had it lost the
page because I'm
there but when you refer to
the like tronic care
giving with
telehealth and
Dona Ana County.
So why we're calling it
electronic.
Care giver because
that is very
impersonal that is
it's a private business practices
Madam project that's the name of the
company that's new to the company
alright maybe I need to I I
just think it's it
just doesn't
sound like.
In there we have the human
is involved
in the care giving that that's an
issue for me when we're trying to
do that type of telehealth
health as it is to make sure
that people have access
so that's just so that it that is
a privately owned business that
I understand thank you madam
chair thank
you so the next
thing I have is
going back to
your.
The leader and J.
tip could you tell us what
the the available balances
are for those 2 funds
etcetera.
Madam chair thank you
Representative I do not have
the fund the balance
for the Lita.
And the top of my head but I can get it
for you I
believe that the available
balance on J. tip is
about $20000000.
But I can get you those exact numbers as
well have a great to do
so do we madam
chair.
Are you we have a plan in place
to use those monies
to this fiscal year
or.
Well as the plant manager madam
chair and Representative Lujan
there are pipeline projects
throughout the the fiscal year
of course that
will utilize some of
those funds the
unique aspect
of both the Leda and the need
to fund is that they're not
reverting and
so
date any unused
funds carry over to the next fiscal
year and continue to
support the projects that are
coming up so with that
matches for some more
clarification so as they revert
back then what do you how
do you ask
for future appropriations
to be added to the fund
manager.
Madam chair and representative of Lujan
the administration
of the of the you know the
secretary's office will
determine
an appropriate amount that they
feel
that they will need
to support
the upcoming projects
throughout.
Thank upcoming fiscal year and
probably
into the next just depending
on how many projects
there might be it
is a thank you
yeah and I'm just
I just want to you know that's
one of the most important funds that we have
now for small businesses I know
small businesses my community
are are utilizing
those but one of the
questions they have one of the
issues I think you touched
upon was how are you getting
the information out to the small
businesses what how do you plan
that out. Are
you looking at when they register
as a small business how are you
reaching out giving them information
and check madam chair
and representative of Lujan that's a great
question and it's really
a a a joint
effort between
the folks in our
department our regional wraps are
program people in
need to as well
as our local
economic development
folks on the ground and so
a lot of that
information is.
Relayed through our business retention
expansion efforts those
are visits with
the company's
to let them know about
what our
products are and services that we can
find but then also learning
about what their needs and and
gaps are to
try to assess
what are the best resources for
them
as I mentioned earlier
both J. tip and Lita
R.
solely focused on economic
based companies and
so per
policy ends
and we
can only use those
funds for economic based
companies which are
manufacturers anyone who
creates generates a
product
in New Mexico and
exports it out to their
customers
as well as some of the
non retail service providers
and so that does limit
the number and types of
companies that we can
engage with on those 2
specific programs
so we don't do
a kind of brought
it marketing kind of
blitz outreach to all
types of companies
because.
You know we we we can't help the
retail folks
and.
Understood thank you thank you for the
clarification give that information
out even just talking about that and
this clip clarifying that
helps with
some of that information those
questions.
I guess my last question madam
chairs will quick
shout Sam Collins you guys are lucky
to have him I've worked
with Sam calling to
sentencing
and
see.
****
yes for the budget for
the another budget
question is the
creative industry
we put $2000000
in to to
that
program to be created
under the EDD
what are you going to be what to
you from this past
to implementation
of it what do you 6
going to suggest if you know
you're going to need to make this even
more successful and
check. Madam
chair and Representative
Lujan I think that what we
hope to glean from
the 2 efforts
the assessment
that the contractor
will bring back to
us at the end of the after their
work is done to
say
you know kind of this is the landscape
visit the gaps and this is what
you would need in order
to really make this
successful and then
also the from
the proposals
that we have received from the
communities
identifying projects
for community and economic
development in I'm excuse
me creative industry
that will give us a really
good picture we hope
of.
The. The types
of businesses within that broad
umbrella of the creative
industry that
exist in those different
communities and
how we can
maybe target our
efforts a little bit more towards
those to support
those so
at this point it's a learning
process to gather the
information
and
hopefully through
once we get to the end of the
fifth this first fiscal year
we'll have a better idea of
of how we will focus in
on that a little bit more I
really appreciate that so we're still in the
phase of of information
and and research and so we
don't fully know how much we're going to
be if there is even gonna be
and asked to to fill those
Kaufer so to speak is that
correct okay there
is there madam chair there will
be an ask for
sure I don't know what the amount is
but I know that that the
agency will be
requesting
at least one F. T. E.
baby to
to
have full
time regular employees
in those positions
for that division as
well as additional funding
for for ongoing
grant opportunities so
the hope is that we will be able
to
issue of the
remaining.
I think it's 18
requests at
$100000
each
would expand all of the
funds in
addition to the 200000
for the contract so that
the funds will be expended
in this fiscal year and then hopefully we
can have some recurring
funding to continue
thank you for that update really appreciate
that thank you madam chair thank
you. Thank you so
much representative representative
Allison. Thank
you madam chair my first
question was on slide
36 where you
have listed a
table of economic development
professionals
of you show a
lot of context but
no numbers but
I found the contact numbers and
the small booklet so
that answered my first
question my second
question is of
if a group of concerned
citizens of a
community
formed the group
to make
improvements in their community
do they qualified to
ask for
the main street program
funds.
Madam chair and
Representative Allison
no the main
street funds
are
actually.
Directed towards
capital improvement capital
outlay projects that is the
only money
that actually goes out
into the communities
through the main street
program the
funding that the department
receives for the New Mexico mainstreet
program is.
To pay
those 10
specialists who
work with all the companies to
provide the technical
assistance in the
various areas at no
charge.
For their for their projects
does that make
sense.
No not really
madam chair I have a
community aware
of here
it's on the Navajo Nation
so we
run into a lot of
sovereignty issues
and it so
it seems like
local
leadership is not doing anything
they want the main
government which is based in winter
ought to bail them out but
that doesn't happen all the time
so a group of
people concerned
citizens are trying
to improve the community of
Shiprock and
I'm just trying to help
rural maybe leave him into
the right direction maybe
of Leda funds or
whatever we can
get hello what do
you recommend that they
they call or
talk to madam
chair and representative
Allison I think that
probably the first
step would be to
contact our
tribal liaison at
EDD
and
perhaps you know have
a conversation with her as
well as
the other regional Representative in that
area to
to understand you know what
the issues and needs are and
then we could from
there.
Assess whether or not any of our
resources could
help or help them
identify additional
resources
okay thank you for that madam
chair and then my
last question
is.
With the renovation
of a local golf
course in my
community with the qualify
for main street or
would you prefer the contact
leader.
Madam chair and representative
Allison I
unfortunately lead it would
not. Be
an option for
renovating a golf course
so they
would madam chair
they would. Need
to apply for a capital
outlay to make any improvements
on the golf course.
Senator.
Madam chair and Representative
Allison I am
can't
answer that question because I don't
now I'm sorry I I don't
have experience with that
level of capital
outlay.
It would not be a a request
for capital outlay through
EDD.
Okay thanks for that thank
you madam chair.
Thank you Representative
any other questions
before we let
Sarah go and
have her first experience presenting
in front of the
committee.
Thank you I know there's
some follow ups that you
are going to do so I appreciate
that and you can just send those to Erin
and then she'll send us to send those
to the rest of the committee so thank you
very much for being here
I hope you're not emotionally scarred
from this
experience
there's a lot of passion as you can tell
in terms of of
of of legislators really
wanting to make sure their communities
benefit from a lot of the
money that that this department
has and wants to get out there
and so we want to do our
part to help that happen for
you so thank you very
much Sir I appreciate that
and appreciate you being here madam
chair and members of the committee thank you
so much for having me and
thank you for those kind words
I'm just very
pleasant experience
thank you good good
