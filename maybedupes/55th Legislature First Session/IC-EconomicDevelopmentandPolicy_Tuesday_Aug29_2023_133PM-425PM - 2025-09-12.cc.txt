Lunch it is
1133
the rest of our
afternoon.
Is about public
making.
And then the types and impacts of
tax increment development
districts or something
that we can only know of as
kids.
We if we have public
comment we will have that at the
end and then
just a reminder that we do have a
reception tonight from 530
to 7:00 at the Amador
live thanks
to our friends at the greater Las
Cruces chamber of commerce
and also Max Bauer
at the end of your life
so I'm
we are starting off with
public banking you've been in our committee
before and
we know that this is an
evolving.
Endeavor that there are
things that you are learning
that you're connecting with our groups
that you are working with
and I think this is a really great
path that you are follow
up following as a public
banking because
there are a lot of a lot of kids in
the sandbox on this one
and you want to make sure that everybody
works well together
and so we have Angela Merker
who is the executive director of the
alliance for local economic profit
prosperity or athletic
we have put up pull R.
Faulkner who
also works with Affleck
but is it safe to say that
you're the lobbyists there
are I mean as I've kind of already
done it so yeah you
your and we also hear
listen and Harold I'm not sure your role
in this so when you start talking if you
don't mind sharing with
us you're part of that that would
be fantastic but
Angela born here all the way to go and
turn it over to you and let you
do your thing.
Thank you madam chair
and I want
to thank you for the opportunity
to they and front of
this committee again
you've done well with
the introductions
except I want
to introduce
Herold who is our
has been a strong
financial participant
and with lots of financial
knowledge and expertise
on
working on the implementation
plan and the financial
plan for the bank
he's former president
and CEO of
state employees credit
union and sent house
in Santa Fe.
And you'll hear more from him
as we
proceed.
I also want to name is
since we're here in Los crucis
we have one of our
board members present with
this and that's
general crying who's
sitting off to my
left and
John Mooney knows who
is among other
things the
board chair of the
greater Los crucis
partnership.
Is also a
member of our
board so I wanted
to name an honor
them and their
participation with
us and I know Johnson's
as regrets that he can't be here
today
yes.
So.
As you've heard from us in the
past years and
also from former
sponsors of legislation
Representative Roybal
Caballero and Senator
Steinborn we
have been advocating
for
increased ways
of accessing
capital in an equitable
fashion that
will support small
business development and
more development of
our rural communities
outside the I. 25
quarter.
Including of
support for
agricultural
development as
well.
But with the emphasis
on the local economic
prosperity and that
includes our pueblos
and tribal
lands.
We have
up we're a statewide
organization just
as a quick recap of
who we are we
are
nonpartisan we have
about 1700
of. Full
who have requested
that they keep up with us through
our email
list and there you
come from as many as
35 to 40
communities around the
state.
In our active
participation
in the state we are members
of the New Mexico Food and ag
Policy Council
where member of the
southern New Mexico green
chamber and
we also are a founder
and participant in
sustainable equitable
economic product.
Economic democracy or
seed New Mexico
which is an advocacy
group for
small businesses
and.
All of a chamber
of commerce for
small business
we're also associated or
affiliated with the
American sustainable business
network the state
of New Mexico is
and more member of the
C. 3 network which
is also a statewide
advocacy
network.
Through that we
have made.
Numerous and
deep deepening
relationships
throughout the state
with groups
that are interested
in small business
in rural development and
what and I
and we share
our mission with them shared
values with them.
I do want to note that
we are.
Addressing and
are supportive of
and wanting
to enhance
the work of
the economic development and
there a 20 year
economic development plan
for the state
which is empowering
collaborate New Mexico's
economic path
forward that
was issued in October
twenty twenty one
and we it's especially
address the priorities
or support the priorities
of increasing original
capacity for economic
development and
sustainability
and also
especially increasing
equitable access to the
resources for local
rural and tribal small
business
owners.
And I'll explain
more of how we
we've develop
without explaining that all
state we have
identified
over the years
the last 4 years
we've done a lot of data
collection we've
interviewed a lot of people
and various groups
throughout the state.
To identify
where are the needs
what are they
where are they receiving
financing and
where are they are
experiencing gaps
and being turned down in
their financing.
Most recently
about a month ago we
had affirmation from
and an outside study
that was done for
through the NMFA
from a group called next street
and that's referenced on
your page for
the there
are reports to
the
NMFA oversight
committee on July
28 stated that a
gap exists between
local prosperity and
current financing
opportunities
they.
Label the underserved
segment of the market as
no man's land and
you'll see a chart that references
that on
on your page
I.
They.
The New Mexico small
business ecosystem
landscape findings
included the following and
I want to emphasize
those because
of I think they're
important in addressing
where we want to go
next of
most capital for New
Mexico small businesses
comes from banks and
the small business
administration
and in the past 10 years
banks have reduced small
business investments
by more than half
of their 2007
amounts a
reduction of
$500000000
for the in the state
while doubling the average
loan size to larger
businesses
and this is related
to banks
maximizing
minimizing their
administrative costs
and maximizing what
they can do with
profits in
making profits
credit access has
decreased disproportionally
for small businesses over
the past 15 years
and small business lending in New
Mexico is currently focused
in Albuquerque
and Santa Fe metro
areas and I would say
based on the right data we
have from
FDIC I would also
add Los crucis is really
the I. 25 court
for.
Access to
of the COVID funds
was more limited for rural
businesses and in
part that was due to
the. Lack
of digital access that
some of the businesses
had I'd like to
refer you to the
chart
that said labeled capital
landscape local
providers.
This was the study that
was presented to
the NMFA oversight
committee and
you'll see and read the
circling of what they
identified I don't like
the name but the
no man's land I'm
calling it the gap
and that
gap that is identified
there is not proportional in
terms of amounts
for any of the groups but
it does give a
good description
of where current
funding programs
our house to
now
and what's
anticipated for
what what might be
possible.
Down the road where
where's the potential
on the next slide you'll
see a reference
to what what
did they do provide no man's
land today and I'd like to
highlight that
need for alternative growth
capital products that bridge
between micro
loans micro
loans are often those that
are
offered by the
CDFI said our
state.
Once
a community development
financial institutions
there are from there
and a quick description of
those they're
often have
significant funding from
the Wall Street banks
and they the city
of fires are used
to
channel the
funds that Wall Street
banks are required well
banks are required
to of.
Put toward community
development in the bank in
the communities in which
they in
which they live
so these
what's in that gap
is the right are
the is the bridge
between these microloans
and then the commercial capital
options which are
generally the larger
amounts coming out of
the Wall Street
banks.
So a quick
look at what are the
trends in New Mexico
now we know
that of the Wall Street
banks are primarily
funding of
international and also
out of state more
course our
deposits do not all
get channeled into
depositing back into
the community as well another
way of this
describing that
community banks are funding
commercial real estate
according to FDIC
data and
also have deposit
lending ratios of
56 to 57
percent.
Which.
Indicates that there are
deposits that they
have a deposit on
hand that are not being
invested
in loans
lending they are
being invested in other
financial products that are
making money for their
shareholders.
Of.
No man's land
business segment
segment is not being served
and the top 3 small
business lenders
as Herald repeats again
repeatedly
is
are all out of
state.
What's at risk
we think that there is a lot at
risk and you'll see the listing
there on
slide 8
of
we.
Increase the
the prevalence of food
deserts loss
of community wealth and
recently the sentence
and. We
need to
we need support of
businesses that can
address adaptive
practices in our
agriculture and in
other ways
that climate change
is affecting us
there are entrepreneurial
ideas out there that
are not necessarily all
high tech
and
aimed at
the.
Venture capital kinds
of options
for funding
of and and we
think that they
need they need
some support to get those
ideas out.
So.
We want
to.
What we want to
address what's happening
in their economic
literature
right now as we speak
there is a growing
emphasis
on especially
coming out of
COVID that
the emphasis on
globalization and
maximization of
profit banking is not
working not
that we didn't know
some of that before but
it's we've got
more evidence
today
and the
there is increased
emphasis among
a number of economists saying
we need to put more emphasis
on looking at what's
the impact of our policies
on stakeholders not
Jr shareholders
and also
it doesn't mean
that we don't still achieve
profits we're just
not going to
be
to the extreme and then
out of and even greedy
about that.
So.
We'll leave that point and
then we want to
also raise the
reserves of
that has come out through a study
that was done as part of
Tennessee looking at
how they are
going to approach a
public banking
one of the pieces of
research that was done just
a year point 5
ago.
Says that were there
are flourishing.
Community banks and
credit unions there
are flourishing small
and mid sized bank
banks that they
go hand in hand
if you have and
and it makes total sense to me
because you have if
you have small
and mid size banks which
would be our community
banks and I am the our
regional banks
then they
probably have closer
relationships with those
communities and they're also
fostering the
businesses there
and
right now we have 32
community banks
and 40 credit
unions but of
those credit unions only
about I think
it's just under 20
percent are currently
doing commercial loans
but there's interest among
them to be able
to expand and do
more because they want
to address this
financial gap in
more communities as
well.
And what we
have a population
of.
Twice over twice the
amount of new of
North Dakota
but North Dakota has
63
community banks
currently.
Due in large part to
their partner
programs that they have
with the community
banks in their in
their throughout the state
and also
they've done a lot
to
coordinate
ensuring that all
of those community banks
and credit
unions have done
their security and
risk of
software
enhancements
for protection of
the data and
integrity of their
records
and
anyway the contrast there
63 current
community banks in North
Dakota 232
and our state
with them
having a less than half
of the
population.
So what we
think.
The.
One solution in addressing
our financing is
to create a State
Bank and
add a an additional
depository to the
state but also
increase the financial
capacity of the
state or through the lending
programs and
to be able to
more fully
support.
The small business
and community it
rural community
development.
I want to share it just
the the slide on
page 11 really
quickly.
When we talk about the State
Bank it would be owned
by the state but
remember we've always said
it had to have an
independent
operation
and it
would be only
in addition to
where we already
have
deposit scenario in the global
banks so
if we're talking
about which
Harold will tell more
about. If we're
talking about putting
35000000 of
our. Any
at any time day we can
have anywhere from 2 to
$9000000000
in Wall Street
banks whether
it's Wells
Fargo bank of
America JP
picked Morgan
chase.
Any of them
35000000 would
be a starting point
for moving deposits from
a global bank
to
our own bank
those monies would not be
spent they'd be
invested in
treasury bonds and so
on.
But what's
different this
time as we are coming
to you and share this
with you we've been
talking as I said
with a lot of people in
our communities
we've spoken with a
lot of you and
ask for suggestions
and recommendations
about how to approach
this and
what we're asking for now
is an opportunity
to do a
pilot program with the
bank on a smaller
scale so rather than
asking are
proposing a
$100000000
capitalization of the
bank which would be
an appropriation
we're asking for a
$10000000
capitalization
and then as I noted
earlier the 35000000
deposit that would of
support the
expansion
of. We
believe that
we also want
to.
We have some donors
who are interested
in supporting
the
the. In
our increased
engagement with the communities
that were involved
in and
they will our
one to help us raise some
funds and we'd also
like to request
funds from
the state as well to
develop
well one of the 2 regional
pilots but we see
creating these 2 regional
pilots to test
and document
the all Lente
models for how the
bank could function
we want to
while the bank is forming
important these advisory
boards and community
hello all these community
conversations in these
regions for
instance we know that
anyone community
outside of the urban
larger urban communities
would be not
be larger so if we were
talking say about southwestern
New Mexico.
Perhaps as a court
with Silver City
but including lords for
damning and even
truth or consequences
as a region
to work with
with representatives from
that area
of
developing
identifying in
deeper
detail
the gaps
in the what
the.
Financing is available
of their what the needs are
the financing and
then have those programs
in place when the
bank can be
implemented.
And then also formalise
the could the collaborative
relationships with
the the financial
institutions and
those lending institutions
would be both the credit
unions and the
community banks of those
communities which
is would be the
access point for
the
borrower
to go to the bank
to the credit union
and then engage in
the potential of the
lending programs that are
there I'm I'd
like to invite Herrell
to step in and
discuss this further and
review the finances
with
this.
Right here it's ready for
you.
You madam chair thank you
and again thank you for
allowing me to
join remote way I would love
to pin down there they had a prior
commitment this afternoon but
to thank you for
a for allowing me to
be there
are you know I think it's just
wanted to.
And we want to get into
the detail of financials
or
answers questions at this
point I'm I'm open
to the way.
I think if you could highlighted
a bit more on
the
what would be possible with the
pilot program
proposal heralding
of especially
on.
Of 13 and 14
pages.
You know I think with this
the pilot program will allow
us to at least
again as Angela mentioned
how to test the
waters
some existing communities and
rebuild it might be a
definite need and
be able to to
meet the needs of those communities
are sometimes
they. Question
becomes
why
why we need a public
bank and why
why can't the banks
currently.
Do this without the
state being involved in
so.
You're just back up a little bit
of excellent things are.
Is that these banks and
credit I'm cert
heavily heavily regulated
and and
under a fair
amount of scrutiny and so I
think a lot of times
there is
no.
There's a point where they will
what will go towards
the the path of least
resistance which is
let me let me make
loans that are
easily to identify
usually for collateralized
usually get appraisals on
and so when
it comes to
your work I'm sure commercial real
estate residential real
estate everybody
understands those
but when it comes
to
farming equipment
or
perhaps you.
And I give an example of a
dental office trying to open
Google trying to take dental
equipment dental
chairs and
those kind of things are different types
of collateral management
something so so
again they are good those
muscles our
farmers starting out
we're going to greater nation
systems and those
so tractors
on those things
are are are are
less desirable in terms
of collateral and so
when we when we get to
those.
And it's not that they're bad loans
shows that there are
there are
collateralized
to
okay.
Number 2 sometimes
and so I think there's some fear
in doing so that
were the State Bank
mentors help help
support those banks
that want to do these loans
in their communities
and give them a
backing either some
sort of a guarantee or
take a portion of the loan or
where the bank
and so the bank is learning more
secure position
sorghum the public bank
is not a not a
substitute for bad
loans you're saying
is an acronym for good
loans that are
being made today because
of lack of
collateral or or
tried to collateral that
isn't isn't something
that the bank will take so I
think allowing us to
yes these are viewed communities
which should prove our point
but I think we can we
can make this happen and
make it happen very
well.
Thanks Herald.
I think that
what I'd like to
emphasize
is that
if we had
starter with the $10000000
appropriation to initiate
this pilot
of that we
would be able to establish
the bank and also
created lending
programs that would
of.
Could land up from
300 to
$350000
over the the.
Thank expanse of
time just on the
basis of that
$35000000
deposit
because a
bank can both
create money
and lend money
and make money so
it makes money we
know by charging
interest and getting
the repayment of
those
loans but it
makes money because it
can leverage
deposits.
So if it has
$35000000
on deposit it
can leverage according
to the
legislation.
In the U. from the US
Congress can
leverage up to 10
times what it's
deposit load is
so 35000000
could allow what
we're not looking at that
is X. as stretching
that far we're looking at
more like
additionally going
for 80 percent
of that out but it
could
legitimately
legally.
Leverage up to of
$350000000
if it was maxing
out of
and below
that we
look at 250
to 300000000 in
lending capacity
which would be an
enhancement to what
we're already doing you've been
generous with these
revenues we've been
getting to
add additional
programs to
NMFA
of other groups economic
development I've gotten additional
funding
department of agriculture
but it's still
not addressing all
of the need and we know
that the small business
community is
the top employer of
the state in the state and
so at
collectively the numbers are
there and this
is one means
of adding additional
capacity to
address this group that's
not being funded
but as Herald said
with
legitimate
with the legitimate credentials
they're just not traditional
collateral it's how
do we
how do we enhance
their ability to
access
of for instance
department of agriculture
funding that's there but they
need additional
up they need additional
funds to match
or to access
those funds and
the same thing with some of the other
economic development
programs
and also in health
care of
a number the apartments have
places where
there are additional
funds needed that would
help.
Entrepreneurs
access
new programs
and expanded financing
if they just have about
additional piece and
not everybody has collateral
especially land collateral
to be able to make that work
including our tribal communities
with sovereign lands
it's how do we support
small business
entrepreneurs who want
to be developing
more in
our
problems and tribal
lands
so
I think that's that's an
area that we really want to
emphasize
is.
How to enhance
that area
of you
know that.
The that was identified
in the NMFA study
as no man's land
how do we address that
gap and also how
do we.
How do we support these
additional people who want
to be contributors in
our economy
and you know it they're
not coming in
with nothing they're
coming in with good
ideas
and just a lack of
getting that next
step
and the US situated
in the business I
want to highlight just
of one
more
item.
With you and that's the
timeline of the
implementation
because we're talking about a bank
charter that takes
of there's a process for
that that we've
discussed with
financial
the F. I. D. folks
and.
And I
have developed
here what the time
line would look like
for instituting
the bank for developing the
board for recruiting
staff and
then having the
bank ready to
going to operation
in the within
the second year and
that's why we're
requesting a 3
year period so that we
have that first
year for.
Taking care of the legalities
of set establishing a
bank and
then building
that out and
then.
At the 3 year
mark saying
taking
coming back to say okay
this is what we've done
this is how we've been able
to make it
work
these are the issues or
not and
then
going no go on
how we perceive would proceed
from there but it
truly to craft
this as a full
pilot program
but to test out
those lending
program lending
program opportunities
through those strong.
Community of
connections that would be
developed through those
advisory
committees.
Where we already by the way
have some very
strong relationships
developed
over the last several
years we
especially have gone in
and just an example
we've had of
what we call community
conversations in
return and
Las Vegas
of.
Silvercity
we've had a couple of them here
in Los
crucis.
And I know I'm
missing something.
But these are some of the
communities
tells.
I've lost it there but we're
we've been out and about and
we've we've
engaged with the community
leadership
and.
And also through our allied
organizations
with making
more and deeper contacts
there too as we've
developed our data
on what are the
actual needs that
the community is
our.
Have
identified.
I'm gonna turn this to appeal
are and ask if there's anything that
you have to have.
The madam chair
the the only thing that I would add
is that these pilot
programs would likely have a
5 year sunset
clause on them
because that would be the
appropriate legislation to
do a pilot project like
this.
Thank you.
Thank you for your
presentation.
Yes unless Harold
is there any last comment you wanted
to make.
Thank you.
Right we do have some folks who
want to ask questions
of.
Yes my mic you're always
welcome to just
reach into that.
You're very polite Erin Bond
but you're always welcome because you take
such good care of me and make sure that I'm doing
what I'm supposed to do
we do have Senator Steinborn
representative Armstrong Senator
Shendo.
Body else K. Representative
dungeon.
Okay Senator
both of the
okay.
J. let me know if you do want
to ask questions and hopefully
to I
would just a question before
we go to Senator Steinborn and then
representative Armstrong
you know we we've been this
that this conversation full
disclosure you are member of the Los
crucis green chamber of commerce
which has no
impact on this we've had this
conversation even before you
started out with that
and so I'm curious
as to you know the
different approach
now.
And I think it's a wise approach
to go to a pilot program
because this is a big.
A big concept
right
and
and I have a feeling we have public
comment.
Now if
anybody else.
Cap figure I saw like
I remember you
so I figure that what will probably do is
public comment after this
presentation
just so that you don't have stick
around
and so
but I but I think that the
idea of a pilot program
is actually a really smart
so the kind of see
like we will
because I think a lot of the
fear is that if this is a statewide
thing and something happens
that is a negative thing
how it's going to affect so many
people right
and so I
don't know if that was the reason but
that that was my question is what prompted
you to move to the pilot program was of
the conversations that you had with people
all over the state was it just
kind of working in understanding the
industry more what was what was
the reason for that.
Thanks for that madam chair
of they are
there were several reasons
bills one of which
was it feels
really scary to
be.
Allocating appropriating
$50000000 for
a new idea that's a
big changes are pointing
out and so
we heard that pretty
consistently from
legislators that that was
a big gulp
and so
that has prompted
us to then
ask okay then
if we had a smaller
amount to work
with how could
we still approve in the
bank and that's
where
internally and
also.
Wedding was emerging from
our community conversations
and that other
contacts that we had
we said what if we
focused
on
we originally were using
the terminology what if we
focused on a couple of
communities and
really worked with
those communities to
identify their needs and
and
defined landing
programs out
of those needs
that could that
would be compatible with the
kind of collaborative
landing that we had been
discussing and
then when we
looked at the
financials on that
on those spreadsheets we
said well when we talk
about to
communities what we really
need to address it is
to regions
because
a rural community
a of a
community of say
10000
people isn't
going to
create the
the kind of.
Mix that we need
the the
size that we need to
actually work this
out but if we're talking
about a region with
comparable interests
and
needs then
then we could look at and
and see that look at the
feasibility and
it probably wouldn't
feel as scary going
into that and
that so that's why we've
been.
Develop this idea of the
pilot with
2 regions rather
than the whole state
with 50000000000
yeah I think that's a smart approach because I think
all of us are like we that's
a lot of money I know like
I said it's a big gulp
yeah so thank you
for answering that as well so
Senator Steinborn and then representative
Armstrong thank you madam chair
and thank you for The presentation I
appreciate it this is something
this I spend a lot of time thinking
about and understanding
and helping to create a
fiscally sound
transparent good
government
structure in
force so I want
to just ask
well make a few comments
but ask the question I'm a
little skeptical of
that that
the data from
the finance authority report on the
no man's land
zone it seems
like Angela tell me if I'm
wrong madam chair
the no man's land
where they basically
could.
Say that there's a
lack of funding is just
for businesses with more than
250000 in
revenues.
Who is that
is that right. Is that
what they're calling the no man's
land. It's
kind of like between start
up and big
revenue is a no
man's land.
No that's that's
accurate okay
it's just madam chair that little
bit of a confusing chart
but.
Okay so I and I say
that because it can they make it seem
like for start up seed
stage is that there is they
mention Albuquerque idea creative
start ups that there's logo's
there as if it covers
every need in that
area and we know
that's not the case right there's
plenty of start ups you don't have
access to capital at
all. So
at any rate that I might push
back on that a little
bit on this chart
but
but none the less.
I just want to make a few
comments which is.
I love this idea because
number one we're already doing
this as a state
and we have given when
COVID happen we gave
0.$5000000000
to the New Mexico finance
authority to give
land loans very
low interest loans to
struggling small
businesses.
If you all aware that we did that
we gave 0.$5000000000
to a public entity of New Mexico
to say here help small
business of New Mexico
my and then I think we did at the following
session we gave more money or maybe
we we gave it into truncheons
my understanding reading about that
is that
$0
The New Mexico small businesses
representing $100000000
have utilize those loans right
now. So
right there there's a demonstrated need
okay across New Mexico
for businesses were struggling during
COVID but none the
less people who
felt like they needed a little bit of
help.
Number 2 course we just
did a $50000000 program
to the New Mexico finance authority
to build spec
buildings again
more money The New Mexico finance
authority so my
point is colleagues were already doing
this we're giving lots of public
money to work with the
private sector we're doing at
3 trusted New Mexico
Public. It'll
then known as the New Mexico finance
authority and the benefit of this
structure is
that through a public bank
that by law by this bill
would have to be chartered.
By the FDIC is a
bank would have
oversight of the legislature
would have experienced
financial bankers
basically running at
but we have a broader community
mandate we could put that money
instead into this
instrument and
rather than just have dollar for dollar
we loaded it comes back
to because of the way
banks work we can leverage
that deposit for I think
it's 3 times
multiple to be able to
loan out that much
more and
we can meet these needs in
perpetuity rather than the one
time thing we did we have a
demonstrated need for
through the NMFA
we can create this instrument that's
then in perpetuity
has a broader mandate even
beyond just job
creation help with community
development as well
so I could appreciate
all the concerns and I think we work
really hard to write an instrument
that deals with those but I
think it's just
using public money for public
purposes and and
that's what we're talk about using a little
bit of citizen
money to put into an instrument
that will then come back and help the sister
in New Mexico and has
grown what we've seen in North
Dakota was they did this to
protect their agriculture
industry 0 years
ago and now that's
grown into $1000000000
instrument that has now
help them with flooding
help them with all kinds of public purposes
so I think with our
3.$5000000000
surplus starting with
$10000000 in this
and saying okay were you doing with that
and have an affair now it's
put in into an even smarter
mousetrap just seems
like a really great economic
about diversification idea
for us with all
the safeguards and transparency we
would want for an idea like
that.
And.
So I hope that we do it and
and I hope chair the
committee maybe if it's
point it.
Recommends that to the LFC or
whatever the date that they do
that finally
I just want to tip my hat to my
constituents Charles Clements
who sit in their who just
smiled and shook his head
Charles was first one to tell me about
the bank in North Dakota.
And so I introduced a
memorial one session have us
look at people than talk about this idea
New Mexico for a long time but I introduced
a memorial little did I
know there was a group out there
enjoying her group they've been working on
this for years and
we combine forces
but thank you Charles for all
your advocacy and for being here
today thank you madam
chair allow me that.
Thank you Senator Steinborn and
the this committee knows that if there's
any legislation or resolutions
that want to be endorsed that they need to
be talked about
with Martin this
time around
and they
need to be submitted in full
and complete by the end
of our September meeting and then
we will discuss
those.
At that meeting will do a 5
minute little pitch fest and
then we will either
move or not move to
endorse something in our last
meeting in October
so I'm grateful for that
Senator I think you Senator Steinborn
representative Armstrong.
Thank you madam chair and thank you
for the the
information.
I I heard that
that an entity
would be running this bank
where what who is that entity
or is that done after
we appropriate the
money.
Madam chair representative
Armstrong the
of the
entity running the
bank it would be managed
independently so aboard
would be selected
and they would recruit
the.
The leadership of the
bank the
the the way that
the passed
legislation has
identified the
members of the
board include
the NMFA
CEO
the state
treasurer
the department
secretary of economic
development and
then.
For members
for people who would
be have a strong
community development
background and
and finance and
then for people who are
specifically have
banking and or
investment and or
you know related
deep financial
backgrounds thank
you for that and what they
would there be a fee charged
for that or with
the state pay them to do
this how
how would the taxpayers of New
Mexico pay for that.
For the board
yes.
The. Madam
chair representative
Armstrong the
board as
we had of it had it
defined was
not receiving a
compensation for
that
all of I think that's
also true of the state
investment council
okay thank you for that
and and
how
with they would be in direct
competition with local
banks in our community
is that correct.
Madam chair
representative Armstrong
that's not correct
they would be working with
the community
banks and credit unions
there is no competition
because the
community banks are not
holding their
holding municipal and
county funds but they're not
holding state funds
and the
State Bank would not be
is established
to be
competing with those
thanks for
work in fact
the history
of the in North
Dakota is that they've
actually help
those banks expand their
businesses rather
than contract
that's why they've had
that's why they have currently
so many healthy
community banks
thank you for that it I just
kind of see it as a competition
because they would be
Lente the you
know the the the private
individual may be choose
to go to the State Bank instead of
the local bank
but you're saying that the State
Bank what loan.
Things that maybe the local bank
wouldn't loan is from what I
understand so
how.
How do you
recover bad
debt.
As the State Bank.
Madam chair
representative Armstrong
of we have
written of.
Allowances in the
financial
analysis for
about dad read
the history with
North Dakota is that they
actually have a
lower
bad debt right then
national
averages
so that but it would be
written in there and
and you know we the
bank would go after the bad
debt just like other
banks would do it wouldn't be
addressed over you can't
make the payment well that's
okay
it would still be in
a strong management range
you go back and and still
tried to retrieve that
and then.
Yeah okay well
I was I was just curious
because the way that
you were talking
about how this would work is it's a
lot a lot of start
ups that possibly
wouldn't be looked at from a
regular bank
and so
probably the reason the regular
bank wouldn't loan is because they
didn't have any
anything to.
To recover.
Most banks will loan if you have
so if they have something to recover
so I'm I'm just worried
a lot that's just a little
worry of mine madam
chair is that you
know we the bank
could have a lot of
bad that if they can't
recover if there's nothing to recover
same thing on the sovereign nation
I don't know how you would recover
land or buildings or
anything else if it was
on the sovereign nation because
they you know their sovereignty
so that was one concern
the other the other
problem that I have
is I remember
2008.
Really really
well.
A lot of businesses went belly
up a lot of homes
got repossessed
and so I worry that
if we.
As a state.
With state money taxpayer
money start
loaning
possibly to businesses that
may E. or
start ups that may
not
that shouldn't be in business.
We could do we could
have another 2008
I mean I saw more businesses
that I wanted to see
go belly up
because they didn't have
any
savings they didn't have any
way to keep doing
business their payments
were more than they could
they got in over their
heads.
I saw a lot of businesses
survive because they
didn't get in over their heads and
that's all about management
but I worry a little bit about
that.
And if we're already doing it
at the state level.
We could just keep doing it at the state
level some thank you madam
chair. Thank
you Representative
one respond to that.
Yes I would like to
Madam chair
representative
Armstrong they
there would be Chris it
criteria for
those loans and
the.
The partner loaned
Lente means that
the State Bank
has a piece of the action
but the credit
union or
community bank is
also has a piece of the
action and the
borrower is actually
going through that community
bank or credit union
so there there's so
shared
there is a shared risk and
shared
up
ownership there of
that landing
and.
And we're not talking about
the extreme or
radical
radical kind of landing we're
talking about that
their criteria
are adjusted
of away from
it to give
more space to the
regulations that Harold
was talking about
but they're not they're
not doing away with
criteria at all so
we're we're not
talking about
major
kind of extreme
kind of lending we're talking
about.
That there are more factors
that are built into for talking
about people who know each
other in the community what's
the reputation
what what did those
relationships have
to offer
that inform
the landing
so there are other factors
there but it's not about
just wide open
no criteria
Lente thank you for
that and I'm I was curious
so if there
is.
If there's this community bank
at this in conjunction
with the State Bank
is is that what I'm hearing community
lender in conjunction with the
state and there's
of a local
bank.
Are they held to the same standards
through the
FDIC.
Is the community bank in the State
Bank held to the same standard
as as
of of.
St new send up
of Madam chair
representative Armstrong
of they be
held to the same
regulations
and and also
for the fed
because we would want to
be able to
use the federal and
and so on to
so yes
there to be state
regulations and the state
regulations
are.
Very consistent with
the FDIC
regulations they're almost
the same
and so
the it's
not an independent
institution that has
no regulations
and it has
Herald may be able to address
this even further but
with the
risk management and all that
would be done within this
within the bank that
also would
inform the kind of lending
programs that are
developed and
the criteria developed
and the the
individual community banks
and credit unions would
sign on to agreements
about how those lending
programs are functioned
so that when they're making
the initial review
of the and
potential borrower
that they are they
know what what criteria
they're working from for that
particular program
and they've agreed to that ahead
of time okay thank you
you just made a comment that it
would might be something
to the effect
of.
You know I'll like I say a new
sendo Wells
Fargo.
Wouldn't land to somebody that
the State Bank might lead to
some kind of COVID like that so I
was curious if they were
held to the same standards
with all the same regulations
that are given to
the the
what I think what you're calling
the.
Public have the public
banking.
So they will be held to the same standard
and same regulations okay
thank you madam chair thank you
Representative Senator
Shendo. Thank you madam
chair of the for the
presentation of
several questions
I had a chance to
listen to the former
a bank CEO
at the CCSD
west in Idaho
of last summer he was
a presentation
done.
The bank and so forth
so from home or from
what I understood
is the whole banking
system and North
Dakota
start with the state owned
bank so the whole
banking system
the whole eco system was built
around North
Dakota State
Bank.
And from my
understanding there are let go
wholesale lender
kind of like so they
don't necessarily land
but they help credit unions
and other banks
with of their loans
and stuff like that it is I believe
that's my understanding
and so I guess my
question is.
That was 100 plus
years but he was 19181919
someone a time period that the bank
was established so the whole
banking system was built
around that all
of the state's
deposits every
money to come into the status of the
quota was deposit in
the state bank.
So if that was the
case to me like in New Mexico
we would be deposited every
single dollar that the state
has into this
bank.
Of it we
of I just throw that
out there because I was trying to
understand
let me fast forward to today
in New Mexico you have this
banking system already in
place.
How do you.
Car about the
space for this
when you know
I'm back in 1919 or
whatever but
it didn't have a bank so
the state had to create
1. And
then it'll evolve from there
soon fast forward to the
202423
here today.
How does one go about
that and the other question
is you know we already
had I think Senator
us time were mentioned it
Mexico finance authority
this artist owned by the
state that's do
is similar things
how does that
you know compared to what you're
trying to do and or is
that the vehicle that are in
existence with a few
tweaks.
Could move forward and
create the space
without. The
push back from the banks I just threw
that out there general who's going to
answer that but those are
my thoughts going through
my mind as I sit here and think
about that.
Fund manager I'd like
to invite Eral to answer
the first question that
Representative thank
you Shendo
had.
Madam chair members of the
committee yeah
and has.
Let question you're
correct market
competitive.
Good start but they were
only they were the only
kind of the time we
were I think
what we're looking at today
is there's obviously not
all of the streets for Collins
we're we're going to the
public bank only a small
portion.
Those are monies that are
being sent off to Wall
Street or other banks
for investment purposes
were asked you that
money be
are.
New Mexico state brand
and then we could loans
retail loans.
Loan that money
that money directly
here in New Mexico
so and I
don't
of the.
It is a moral support
mechanism so it could be you
know why it could be a guarantee
program
to a public bank and
sure partially answer
Representative Marshall
question about the
competition part
so.
Measurable with member going to
the stage back
old we always
have all right
credit you and so
September the scenario
would be that
already comes to the
bank.
Again there's nothing here
you know for more collateral
standpoint.
Our current area
we we would like to have
some additional guarantees
or some additional
backing for this review
the State Farm women's
right.
Credit doing.
Our reserves
as $1000000
loan. We will
loan.
You have 1000000 in the
state during.
We'll do the other half is a
second so prince
street because the bank
or credit union and a better
musician and again
these are not
substance use program loans
you just called our
workers and technical
problem and so
so we're we're taking a
second to social order
guarantees a light
summer would just be a coach
grants and one guarantee
75 or 80 percent
of our loan
for
you all didn't have to do
that distributors you
know as a
couple we're reviewing
here in New Mexico
so program
construction we're
tremendously Water and
we don't need all these
funds around all your
work but
again we
can.
Money through the bank
or help support
banker or credit
union I I
don't I'm
very.
The partially I
appreciate that so so
if that's the case then
why the push back from
the bankers association pull
away is that pushed
back so significant
if they're able
to provide loans
that are backed by the state I just
throw that out there if you can
answer
that.
Madam chair representative
maybe so
I I think the perspective
is the
the great color there was gonna
be some competition
where with the
State Bank and we
tried it.
Try to make that clear
that no individual
would come through the black
world leaders support
banks and credit unions
M. to my knowledge
there is no
reason of state backed
program to date to
support
there is the there is the
SBA
program
Senator being a very cumbersome
process
but. There
there is no state programs
related backs backs in
the type of.
Credit union loans
available
or.
Have.
Madam chair.
Senator Shendo if I
can add to that
of
the.
I'm just my train of
thought.
With their community banks
and credit
unions
of some of that
push back as Herald
says is coming
because
they don't see the
the partnering that
is going on but and
they say the
the Lente
is happening that they
are supporting
small business but
the FDIC
data that we have
indicates that that's not the
case that
New Mexico community
banks are primarily doing
commercial lending
and they show up
in the FDIC data
at least as doing
minimal most of
the community banks at
least most are doing
minimal small
business lending
and minimal
Ehrig. Related
landing.
So that's the data that
and that's backed up
by a anecdotal
information that we have
from individuals
who live in various communities
around the state
so.
I think that it could part of
this comes back to what
Harold said initially
about the
of with the
restrictions the
regulatory
restrictions that they're
working under.
They have become
less
more they become
more risk averse
about testing out
some of the other some
of the landing
of.
Applications that they have
received and they
are working from
a narrower
definition of what's
what's so cater land
and what's
not.
I'm. Appreciate
that and that the one thing
that was interesting
was that of
the note Kotak bank
it's not.
Financially it's not we
call it the
FDIC.
Of
guarantee all the
guarantees are from the state
funds and the taxpayers
so it doesn't have their own FDIC
it's it's madam
chair US.
That's correct it's been a
it's yeah it's it
was it was important to be
for the
FDIC it was
originated and
so the
the good faith and
credit of the state of
North Dakota
back up that
bank.
Yes those stories
appreciate it thank you thank you
passionate representative Duncan
and then Representative role by public
at all Representative
little and then Senator
rates
I am kind of hoping that
we
continue to move at least
somewhat on time
because I think the
public comment that we have a
specifically for this topic
of my correct.
Okay I would like to have public comment
right after this
so if we
can kind of keep that people aware
of that as we continue on with the
questioning of this
and remember that if there's something that
can be asked via email
Eric can always go ahead and do that as
well so representative
Duncan thank you madam
chair very
quickly can you
tell me how much let's just
say we establish this
bank can you tell me how
much it's going to cost the smaller
community banks and and
credit unions to
implement the safety measures
that are going to be needed
to in order to
do business with the
bank.
Madam chair and
of Representative
Duncan.
The cost will be
built into the interest
rate those charged for
the loans so
the understanding would be
that the State
Bank would pay an
administrative fee to the
banks for
the cost of of
managing for
taking in and managing
those loans.
And so
the it's not
going to be there will be a cost
to the bank but it's
going to be folded
into the
the fees that they
receive for actually
administering them
it's not going to be something
expected to
that they contribute
essentially to the
loan.
Thank you madam chair
so just so I can get this straight
in my
mind.
The I I assume that would be
a few $0.
To get the security measures
in place would
that be the same type of security
that you would need to be doing
online banking.
Also do you know
that.
I'm gonna do for to
Herald.
Chair of all of you I
couldn't hear old
question.
I apologize.
Chair my question
was in
order for the smaller community
banks and and the credit
unions. I
assume that
the this is
not a
cheap
cost to get the
security measures in place
would this be similar to
them putting security
measures in place if they wanted to
do online
banking.
I want to do whatever banking I'm
sorry online
banking.
Madam right
representative Devin so you're
asking the
the the.
All the to to
submit applications
process is a
reflection.
No madam chair let me
take a second question
out or or the
second part of that so
the security measures
that have to be in
place
before the
community banks can get
involved and borrow money
from the State Bank
those will be folded into
the administrative
the that the bank
loans when they loan
that.
Okay I'll take
that thank
you. Thank
you Representative
Representative Roybal
Caballero.
Thank you madam chair and
and thank you Angela and
Phillip for presenting
today and thank
you also for having given me the
opportunity
to work with Senator
Steinborn in
sponsoring this piece of
legislation over the
past few years as
well we've seen madam chair
gave an overview and
Senator there
been many
advances made based
on our conversations each
session so every
session has
improved
on the way we are
approaching.
The bank in New Mexico
and I'm
grateful for those conversations
because they've there where we
are and also
madam chair I want to say
that that's the whole purpose of
proposing now
the whole idea of a pilot
because a lot
of. This is
one of those conversations
where until you see it
in action
and you see how it's
unfolding the
budget in our local
communities.
You don't get
tangible on
understanding
of why and how
it benefits are
tax payers but
the positioning of our
state economically
on how it will strengthen
it and that's why
I'm I love the
the new approach of
us entering and
requesting for a
minimal amount not the
huge amount that we've been
doing in the past
because it's like
any other demonstration
project a
pilot is a demonstration
project it's just
that so that we can
understand what
works what doesn't and how to
improve
so
I also think that
we've been in the state talking
many years about diversifying
our economies.
And the key word
diversification this is
another example of
how we
diversify
our revenues.
In order to be able
to create
permanent pools
for long term sustainability
that's perfect
this is a perfect way of
demonstrating that
and the only way that we
can.
Provide access
to local communities
madam chair
that have been
underserved
of for number reasons
and unable to
access your
traditional
forms of
capital in
capitalization of
projects
it is.
You know by providing
this diversity and by
providing
of these opportunities
so I see this is
just another way in
which were opening
up the world
of opportunity
through diversification
and that's just
really what we've been talking about
Education how we've
been talking about everything that we're
doing different
in the last couple of
years madam chair
because of the
incredible on a
positive returns
that we're getting from the oil and gas
industry and so
that's created
an additional opportunities
so madam chair it's
also very
important for me to
clarify that
it's not a competition but
it's a compliment.
Public bank is actually
complementing what already
is existing in our community
banks in our credit
unions who have
traditionally
been
hi been
offering these types of
of
lending
to our local communities
however the big difference
is that in
this case
our
local communities
who know best they
know how what the needs
are they know what the gaps
are and they know how to fill
them but they're not in the
position to always be able
to fill those gaps
because they lack
the on traditional
responses to
capitalization
of loans and
that's really important coming
from a community economic
development cap
this is always been a
huge reason
why we've not been
able to do affordable health
health
clinics
affordable
housing affordable
anything in our local poor
communities because
we've not been able
to fill those
gaps and this is another
way to fill those gaps
and still
own.
Have the taxpayers
own and make the
decisions around
Lente and finally
madam chair I want to
remind everybody
that we did a huge
reform
back in the
starting in the 19 eighties
and the 19 nineties and then
early 2 thousands
rebound around
banking
redlining.
Every all of us under
remember I hope
the redlining and
how local communities
and poor state
font
the fact
that.
The the small business
person could not just
walk into a law and
seek a loan.
Either
because.
There was the sub
conscious or unconscious whatever
you wanna call it
subtle.
They were suddenly being turned
down because
they didn't
Representative.
The picture of
what large
banks wanted
them to Representative in terms
of collateral
in terms of all of the
other. Credit
worthiness
and sometimes it wasn't just
credit worthiness that was just
an exclusion so
we had the the bank
reforms that created the community
development
block grants and the
community
development.
CBS had can't
remember of the
Lente
and that the big
banks during
these reforms were forced
to accept
these reforms
because the
federal government
stepped in in order
to create opportunities
for those that traditionally
were being redlined out
of the lending
industry and that
created huge opportunities
madam chair as we've all seen an
affordable housing
that that created in the
eighties and nineties
the big push towards affordable
housing so I just wanted to remind
everyone that
there is a
again we're
complementing not
competing
where
offering
opening up access
and through diversity
which is really key
and then
we're also filling much
needed gaps that are traditional
landing systems in New
Mexico have been unable
to fulfill and then I point
everybody finally madam chair to
page 7 which
really was
important to look at
and that is that.
The reason why we had
large banking
reforms of the eighties
and the nineties and the
2000 was
because
of
wall St banks.
Making major
decisions
on a global level
that had adverse
effect on local
levels that
I have to remind everybody
of that that is
so critical and
that's an incredible
big points of our
state.
Owning.
Our own resources our
state owning
our local communities
owning our
arm are out
funds so I just
wanted to clarify
and kind of add to the
discussion but the
beauty in this proposal
again madam chair in closing
is the fact that we haven't the
ability with a
smaller amount of
capitalization of more
affordable amount of capitalization
if I may
to
demonstrate.
From the local communities
to the state to
us how
effective.
A public bank
can be to
complement
an increase opportunity
and access to capital
where it is still
in 2023
not reaching
the communities of trouble grant
not reaching the colonialists
not reaching
the committee the poor communities
in each 1 of every
single district
that we represent both
senatorial and
house Weiss we
each have
huge poverty
and lack of access
to capital and so this
is a win win for
everybody thank you madam chair
thank you representative Representative
little and then Senator
Griggs.
Thank you madam chair
thank you so much for this
presentation
I am really trying to
wrap my head around
all of this
and so
I appreciate the questions that
have come up on my colleagues
and the example I'm gonna
follow on along the
example of
Mr Dixon's of
of. Scenting
a alone for about a minute for
$0 let's say
so as a small business
owner and I can
imagine my constituents
or our constituents
watching this so
as a small business
owner
let's see I am applying for
this $0
$1000000
loan for my
business
and
it may be
that this I
applaud to 2 sources one
is to the credit union and others
to the big bank a big
bank so am I
understanding this
correctly I
apply to credit union
and it may be too large an
amount for a credit union
to to
have fun to
completely make a look to make
the full loan of
$1000000
or I had
I applied to a big bank
and perhaps I'm
not if I may not be
credit worthy enough because that perhaps
I don't have enough
collateral.
At just
for example
so as
the individual
then.
How will this private
bank.
Help me
help some
of the small
business owner who is
walking into those banks
either of those
to apply for
this loan
and
how will I
know.
What the next steps are
about how I might
be able to receive a loan
of this
amount.
Thank you madam
chair.
Carol do want to take
that.
Madam chair
representative
learning learners
walkers are
primary role has
been tracked
so.
More work coming in wanting
to borrow
$1000000
of mind frame for credit
union.
More may not be able
to find a
map for here is
too large or
is
a
is a type of colonial
group they're not used to
taking a looking for some
additional support
guaranteed from both
from the same back
again.
Want to emphasize.
You're far organizations
all of our rural they
have.
Division Karen rose
thank god the
some sort of answers most
landlords
have
reinvented as well perhaps
for some time
if they are sorry
got.
So visual
backing so again it
is not a substitute.
Bad loans is
redesigning present
Avenue for
businesses to go
through that of the
banks traditionally are gonna
say that however
collateral for
former houses tribal
local state
there's a reason require members
with.
Mexico as long as long
as for
4 years will finance
a management agreement
through by I really
need to years
and so
that brings purpose cater
to the to the
State Bank I'm sorry
we've got those long years
of actors.
More time there were one of
our but would like some
feedback so
we're we're either
us news State
Bank for
our hearing
to your map program long
before we're we're asking you
to partner on that
long you do
have will do have
and we'll figure out we'll take
a break over knowing that we
have this year and people State
Bank to
take care of that.
Your question how does of our
river and no
government money my bag
remind breaking news is going to
work with the State Bank and
so programs and
educational process
on part of that is the
reason to start off
on this pilot program
and into communities
and so it was
indicate those banks
and credit unions in those
communities well structured
rappers also
works and then
the number that are just some public
education about.
The state bankers available
here is a partial ready for
your help support your
local bank where
so that survey
they're not always gonna soaring
of the State Bank even
exists on background of
some more summer
we're **** debuts
you're going to every plan for
your bank credit union
State Bank is going to be in the
background early
support
support support of
banks and credit unions
right reserve your
question.
Yes it does thank you very
much at
a follow up quick follow up
question would
be.
At and I might be
getting into the weeds in my apologies
of that so we can talk
go into detail later
but
should the
under what circumstances you don't
want to I don't want to
presume that
because a credit union or the big
bank has not
approved this
loan
how will I know that the
state
bank is going
to approve
this I don't want to presume
that it's going to be
approved how
will I
know.
Madam chair representative
so so I bring
it up for you would be able to
the bank
to
slowing of our
economy
here.
New averaging over
requests that
doesn't fit in our
our real house if you
will and so
we're gonna take those to
the same bank
level for approval
because we like
the bill we
like what you're doing reading
Instagram posts on our
communities Fund
it does require that our
our categories what we're
hearing here
sorry
so then they will think of them and
then invest
going it'll it'll
leave your program not approved
by the State Bank so
hello you representative
Representative bank to them
traders of the State Bank
or or.
The board here and she.
So those.
Program your question in
the house of our rural
grounding is the
whether it's approved or not
but I'm not sure
chair.
Madam chair at
that Mr Dickson thank you yes
you are
I appreciate
your response and the
opportunity to ask the question
thank you madam chair
thank you Representative little
Leslie Senator
Griggs.
Thank you madam chair and I'll try
to be quick I mean you guys
as of right now
I have.
Have any banks joined on
with you guys are getting community
bank supporting
your
effort.
Madam chair of
Representative Senator
Griggs.
We have individual
CEOs whoever said
they totally get it and
they like the concept
but they're not willing to
speak up right
now.
And.
Against the so
ciation the
association
of.
Is the
association has
been speaking against
a
but.
Based on
of false
or
misunderstandings
or
something but they're
not basing it
on what we know to be the
facts out of the North
Dakota experience.
In and thank you for
for that matter madam chair this
one of the issues
with.
Controversial subjects like
this when we have
we have one group which in
support but we don't have anybody
that you hear that you know
it is in real
opposition as far as
banking association for the
independent association
of banks because we want to
support the
support the creation of State
Bank
but
the the
issues out there I mean
I I think I see some
of them than others hi
I don't see a reason in the
world why this would be
be beneficial
of New Mexico
financed Authority Senator
Steinborn brought them up and
out issues in the
financial authority has made
loans and they have made
loans
some of them similar to
the G. we're
we're describing
where
the bank needs
additional financial
positions
but when they did
that that was through
federal dollars that they
had a federal
program that
they had access to that
then they made those those
loans the
loans or the
programs we created
is legislature
during the COVID
to to help small
dishes of
those were below prime
loans of loans we
didn't we
didn't have start being paid
back for for
3 years and I think we
all recognized.
We all recognize
that the chances of getting
some of those loans ever
paid back were
slim. And
if if we didn't we were
probably kidding are
shipped
gash to the I'm
sure I'm hopeful guys are
paying back right now but I
don't necessarily know that
know that that's the case
I haven't had any
any input from the New
Mexico financed Authority so I
might be off base.
I might be off base
but that particular
program was in
response to a
particular event
that of
hopefully we never see the likes
of
again.
The issues
this is just the
you know it's a unique
deal.
And I
I.
I want to understand the
passion from
y'all.
But I can't
and the madam madam
chair and I see that
we have got
in place
systems that
take care
of most
every possible
more work and if
a borrower
doesn't
obtain Lente
from one bank.
They often obtain it
from another but
if they don't obtain it from
any bank.
Then the risk of
that loan is
probably
high.
I don't know if the risk
is going to be high.
If the state of New Mexico
should then be deciding
they want to spend taxpayer
dollars on a
high
risk.
This are
are high high risk
entity the
opportunity
show I
thank you I
think it would be good.
Initiations 2 of
2 of head
you know the bankers here
so the bankers could then all
for their
concerns and then maybe there
would be regions
or opportunities for
you to
then clarify
with the bankers.
Where they are my
maybe they're
mistaken.
But currently in
and I I know I
wish I was texting
with the Persian Association
minute ago just
to a to be sure
they hadn't changed her
mind.
And they have an.
Show our it would
be.
May be good for us
to to hear both sides
for certainly we make a
decision and I believe
that's where that would be if we
have a you know if we have a bill
that you consider
any of those
things
but the issues
this is a very
and makes it difficult subject
but H. it's certainly
not one that I'm
ready to
support
of but I'm just
want you know I
have one vote out of
112 show
I don't have I don't have a very big
major right there
but will
we'll see and we'll see where we go
from from here show
thank you madam chair.
Madam chair by could respond to
that.
Madam chair and read and
committee.
Senator you mentioned NMFA
in the role it plays in
serving this gap
community
and it
hasn't served it to
date that's why the no man's
land exists
and in conversations now they
have some great programs coming
forward that we appreciate
we totally support
however this
gap is a very specific
niche and it isn't
because it's a high risk
gap is because the
lending organizations are
not loaning to
this this
niche it's not in their
profile or the performer
to loan to them and
so that's why you see it's
not that they're necessarily high
risk and and
and NMFA when we have
conversations and they do not
want to services as as
public bank is
not. They have
said that's not something they're interested
in their programs are
limited there one
time and they're not perpetual
and so that's the difference
is that MFA is doing a great
job actually think they're one of the best
departments of the state
but they are not it is not the
same thing you're comparing apples to
oranges with all due respect
that is they're not serving this
purpose.
Representative Garrett you want to make a
final comment
yes thank you madam chair
I want to say this is the best
presentation of idea I've heard
so far of one thing
I didn't get sleepy
of great
facility
and I like the pilot
idea I think Senator
signed from really
nailed it when he
said taking that
program that
NMFA.
Ran
which was based on Senate bill
3 during 2020
right after COVID
and institutionalizing
that we're not necessarily talking
about huge loans
and I don't know if we do we have
has NMFA reported
on the result of those 3
year loans.
Does anybody that would be paid
back to
now.
Madam chair of
Representative Garrett I
think that
they
they've had interim reports
I don't know if they've had a final
report I know the last
time I heard they
were still
after some of the
delays the late
loans or that
really working
to.
Make good
as many as low of those
loans as possible I
know they got the money
out or maybe
there was one fund that they
turned back $1000000
and I'm not sure that money to been
one but that they really
scrambled to get the
the dollars out
but as a lawyer
said those were one
time funds and
for M. crisis
use read it
but they were those
smaller
amounts.
Right in
madam chair and thank you for that
will will follow a follow up
on that maybe at our
future committee we get the
report but thank you I
feel like
it's this road is
a much better road to go down to
thank you.
Thank you yeah and madam chair
representative Garrett
the if they had a 3
if 3 years to pay their loans
NMFA's probably just
getting data in on a lot of the
loans I would imagine
they do a really good job at
NFA.
So I'd like to thank you
we will open it up for public comment
but I do want to make just kind
of a final statement on this
because
it you know we're looking
we've had conversations about small
businesses having access quick
access to money
when they've had a catastrophe when
something unexpected has happened
to them
we have had
heated conversations
about
payday loans are predatory loans
and communities
particularly communities of color
that are deep deeply
impacted by just
the continued cycle of
poverty
we are talking about making sure
that people have access to
capital that
normally wouldn't we're talking about
like it we think about I mean I
think this teachers from the city is
back when we think about some of the
businesses that are in
this community that are in rural
communities that may
have a mark on their
credit.
And that most conventional banks
won't touch on and I get
that I get why they won't touch
them. However
are we denying an
opportunity for
them to repair their
credit it when
traditional methods won't do that
and that's where I see where the public
bank can come in
and help do that I also think about
people we've got people in our
community in Los crucis Dona Ana
County 20 percent of
our population is in
poverty.
And yet
we've got folks in in in the
and I look at these things like a
spoke of a bicycle tire and I think
I've used this before is that
if we're talking about one issue there are
at least 5 different components
to each of those issues
and so one thing
is not going to solve
this but I think it's
our job to be able to look
at those different spokes
and see where we can
remove whatever barriers
we as a governing
body put
in to allow
people or businesses
or organizations to be able
to thrive we have
legitimate concerns
I think you address those concerns
by talking about a pilot program
I think it was kind of a sigh of
relief just
because understanding
the enormity of it at the state
level I mean there's
there's many of us were just like yes
let's do this because we know that there are so
many New Mexicans that
would benefit from this also
the we understand the
financial risk that we might
take and what that what that
might do one people in the state
and so I feel
that the pilot approach is
a good approach I
think it's something
that you know I think
it will it might be the who's who's
gonna have in their community.
Right it's like.
Maybe not me not me not me
you know it's and so those
are the continued questions but
I you know I
think.
Competition is a good thing
it makes people rise up
it makes it brings the best out
of people and so
you know I don't see this as a
competitive element I do see
this as a complementary element
because we do have businesses and
people who can't get conventional
loans and what we're doing
is we are turning them into
predatory loans that
are 36 percent any
of you have a loan of 36
percent APR.
No and so
we're trying to remove that cycle
of poverty and we're looking
at one of those different spokes to
try and do that
and so I would hope that we would
be open to that I
understand the concerns
especially when we're talking
about the state investing
money and we're trying to
all of us at some point
trying to for the next 78
years be very responsible
on how we spend that
money.
And so I I appreciate
the efforts that you're putting into and I
appreciate the thought from this
committee of trying to be really
responsible with
what we're doing and seen the merits
of what this is can see
the merits of how this can help different
communities and wanting to
be just really
thoughtful and what we
do is so I'm grateful that you've
taken that feedback because
I know that these discussions been happening
for a long time
and when you brought up the pilot
program I think that's like a really
reasonable approach for us to
see if this is
actually going to work without
greater risk to the entire
state and then there are
those of us who have been with it from
the beginning going thank god it
worked and we knew it would work
you know I mean there are those things that we can
do so I appreciate you
being here and I appreciate what you're
doing and I appreciate the
conversation
yes Senator Shendo.
Madam chair I think
will be really good is
there was additional
time available in some
future is to
get not only
in on these individuals but
the bankers association
and people that
were that no man's
land.
The morning be to hear
from individuals.
That haven't been able to
capture loan whatever hear their
story yeah I mean
I think if we had that
very powerful because you
know. We don't
get to ask questions in
on. You know
we've done in the in other
committees where we brought
the 2 opposing groups together
and have that conversation because
it's only then
that we can have the full picture and
and they can hear the questions
they can you know back and forth I
mean I think that kind of
session might be better
for all of us because we also
want to hear from our constituents
you know it it might be on our
own backyard
we don't know little less
we have that I think that
would that will pick full picture
madam trucks but
I appreciate that too because
and especially as as the
chair of tax business and transportation
and is your vice chair
that might be an opportunity for
conversation when we
have when we have the time this
upcoming session is a 30 day
session but I agree with you
I think we do need to have those
conversations because I think that
would probably answer a lot
of questions
that many of us have
about this my manager
from my I
would. Really
like what senator passionate
Otis said one thing that
happens I mean I'm a mediator
as well and if the
parties are talking to each
other.
Then there's misinformation
and misunderstandings
and confusion but if
you were to put a panel together to
addresses
then there may be
common ground found
possibly in some
places that maybe
we neither party
is educated in the other
party's position enough
so that's awesome
suggestions in addition to thank
you what we still do
have 2 more meeting
dates so we have
ones and Silver City and I mean and then
we have our last meeting
dates in
House Los Alamos and
Santa Fe
and so I
would commit to trying to
if we can get that going to
where we can have a panel discussion
I'm looking at you Chris as
well
if we can have that panel
discussion how would the
committee feel about
that.
Correct so and
let's will work on that Polarcus
we can work on that
are you okay we do that instead of doing
public comment.
Okay Charles are you do you okay
if we do that said a public
comment.
All the people we
can get.
The.
Okay I'm gonna give you 3
minutes.
All right and I will
time you.
I will time you for
real.
Well wait a minute just a
minute so
because you will need to be up at the microphone
so I thank you
for all of that and I think that's
what we will do when we finish up the
rest of it is that we will have one
of our last meetings we will have
a morning kind of dedicated to
that
okay so that
we can have those questions because
I think many of us
you know the thing is is that we know that this
conversation is been can to then
going on and I think
all of us would like to move on
it. But we need
to feel like we have the answers to do
that so thank you Senator
Shendo for that suggestion thank you
committee for being open
to that Mr Chairman
the idea of that no
man's land of hearing
them was really
Representative.
As his voice
okay well you know I that
question to come up though is like it
would be nice to hear from people
who would be would be impacted
by that and I think as we've
talked about this on the bus yesterday
we were to in the industrial park
I was talking was sent with representative
Armstrong about how those stories
are important because
we can see we can hear about it from
you all you know because that's what you're talking
about and we can
do the same thing from this side but
until we hear
and put faces to
experiences
is very challenging
and so it's hard to have that one where
the other so I appreciate
that this
so we can have that continued
conversation and then we'll we'll make
sure that that happens in one of our committee
meetings. We'll just
dedicate one of the mornings
to it.
Okay that's a good rest
okay thank you
everybody all
right
so
Charley I'm gonna give you 3
minutes because
then we're going to move on to our last panel
of the day which is about to
so let me get my timer
up.
And the all right you're
ready go
up will those to
couple things that
were brought up here
first of all the bank of North
Dakota.
Was formed in 1918
but North Dakota was a
state
1889.
There is 30 years
of.
Banking
going on at that
point in time.
Okay
and.
Hello. Rancher
1 time that
was remember the 18
nineties and
1910 I
think he said
well. The
bank panic was where everybody
in the county went broke except the
banker the sheriff and they left
town the day before.
Okay so we're not talking
about you
know.
Your. Banking
situation there they did
what they had to do to
stabilize things in North
Dakota okay that's
that's what they did
the second thing is is
that.
I.
First came up with this
information I background
is finance and economics
okay I went in for the rent
as we go ahead and say your name and where
you where you're from Charles
here in town but your less than
truckloads transplant
I'm here in town all right
now it's just for for the minutes
so anybody who's watching on the
web okay yeah
not everybody knows you were
remarkably well no no
what they do is I try to
avoid detection that's
not my 3 minutes I know I'm
taking off 20 second we're there
now now
the other thing is is
that this bank in North
Dakota. I
found out about it and by
1984
I spent years in
corporate finance and that sort of
stuff.
And.
It was an interesting
concept so I've
spent the last
47 years
looking into
this.
Time and time and time
again following down this path
and that one
okay.
It's not a fly by
night.
Outfit at all.
I challenge anybody
to show me a better
unemployment rate
year in and year out for the
last 80
years
and what North Dakota
has.
And as a direct result
of the stabilization
of capital
availability
to Pete businesses in
all the communities
it wasn't.
It wasn't spread enter you'll
see great big huge cities
in North Dakota Bismarck
and Fargo or the biggest
ones the doctor size Los
crucis but there's a lot
of prosperous towns in
that state you have a
minute left Charles okay
so.
The. It's
not a fly by night outfits it's
a been a very very
successful very well
run one and
are the basis of
this is to
implement that
same.
Process here.
And I think that
you. Proposing
it because the bankers don't like
it.
Well.
2008 she
mentioned
2008.
There you go the
credit unions didn't crash the
banks
did.
So obviously
the credit unions were
better managed in the
banks.
So we need
to.
Start looking at this and
not.
Fantasizes to who
is the opposition's all
about.
Because they don't have a good
record.
Okay I'm
done.
What you said 3
minutes.
Thank you Sir.
Appreciate that greatly I spoke to
many years being married
to not following
orders.
All right so we're looking at
the calendar dates so Christian
before you leave
so let's look at the morning of
October 13 that is
our last day our
last meeting so what we will
do is
have that panel on
October 13 we will
be in the capitol
and and so what we'll
have those folks so Polari know you'll
work on that crucial work on
that
and and we'll we'll
get that taken care of so that we can

other public comment
so I will
give the the committee kind of an
update on where we stand
after that but
you're gonna talk about types and impacts
of tax increment development districts
we do have attended
in Los crucis that
has some of thriving
businesses we've been able to maximize
that a great deal their
communities all over the state that have
to its and
Jennifer you're also part of the main street
association with tracks mainstreet
organization okay so I'm gonna let
you take it away
and and thank you for being
here good
afternoon madam chair
and.
Good afternoon madam chair and
committee appreciate your
invite to be here today and talk
about Ted we're kind of
putting this little on its air because
we can really only speak how
are to work specifically
and how it affects us as a main
street program in downtown
Los crucis
downtown Los crucis partnership
we are 501 see 3
we are an economic development
organization
we are nationally accredited with
main street America as
well as the state of New Mexico
mainstreet program
we are district is the
tax incremental district
that overlays downtown
Los crucis and our
arts and cultural district district
is a portion of this we
have 1 of the largest
downtown mainstreet districts
in a CD districts in the
state we're
very fortunate that we've been
able to have a tool such as
the to to work with
and having a collaboration
with the city of Los crucis to
help us move forward on
how our downtown has
grown in Los
crucis over the last
few years I've
been in this position for
6 years
and we have seen
a large
jump I do want to say
in here before we get a little further
that in COVID
we saw 13 businesses
open in downtown Los
crucis
we saw that our businesses
actually use
the money and
the the state the
projects and programs that
you as legislators offered
we saw them actually use it
to their credit and to
use it to to grow
and to become bigger and
better businesses
I'm again my name is Jennifer L.
Garcia because Lossky
I am been here
increases for about 17
years and
I come by way of
Albuquerque New Mexico in
Farmington New Mexico
this is my side
kick.
Susan Kobe she
is our director for the
arts and cultural district
here in Los
crucis.
I'm on page 4
I believe it is you'll see
maps of our community we
have the overlay of our 2
down 3 and then we
have the ACD boundary
over on the right hand
excuse and left hand side
I'm as you can see it's quite
large and we do
see we do have
around 700 businesses
within our district if not a
little more considering
micro businesses mama
pops
not proposing not front
facing.
What we do as to
talking to you guys early
already
we are so we try to be a
signature business
destination as you can read
what our our mission
is while
while growing in our downtown
our biggest hope is that we don't
gentrify our district
that we don't take away from our
communities that we allow
our communities to be
rich in the cultural heritage
that we as new Mexicans so
near and love we see
ourselves as being authentically
southern New Mexico
we are not here to compete with
the missio or the types
we are here to be the living
room of Los crucis
so when you think of what you want to
do the first place you
think of is downtown I'm just
gonna go downtown I want
to see something I want to
have a good dinner I want to
shop I want to meet my friends
so we really try to push out the
fact that we are community
economically based
community as a
community
we follow the 4.approach
with the New Mexico mainstreet
which is the economic
vitality design and
placemaking promotion and
organization everything
that we do have to touch these
4 points as does every other
main street in the state of New
Mexico it has to
follow these 4
points we
all as main street
organizations
really work hard with our local
governments as well
as probably
in your own districts
we you work with your mates
organizations in order
to to grow
a downtown because we we
know by studies that
if you have a
good downtown if you have
an economically vibrant
downtown.
Your town becomes a little more
at the economically vibrant
we have seen those of you who are
not from this area
there was a mall
what they call the mall they closed
and shut down our
downtown they closed
the streets down it was
a walking area
that closed at when it
when dusk yes
urban renewal really messed
with us here in Los crucis
this has been a hard
fought program
that we work along with the
city the county
and many community
members to make sure that our
downtown becomes thriving
and every every
every year we get a little closer
to being greater and
greater.
I am just for the
record
so we talk about
the Los crucis tax
increment develop district which
is the Ted
it was established in
2007
but before the establishment
of the Ted the city
first set and MRA
in place in
our case the boundaries
of the ticket and the boundaries
of the MRA are not
exactly the same they're
just close enough to be
confusing.
Extremely
close.
More.
So part
of what I think maybe our
Ted really successful is
that was a partnership between
the state the
county the
city and there's a public
election to set the Ted
as per the
state statute.
The purpose of the 10 per
the statue is to create
jobs and generate new
revenue is through increased
economic activity
so I believe that
is been the goal for
the city as well as
us
we are not
in charge of governing the to
talk about a minute but we really
work with the businesses that are
within that so
economic vitality is
always at the top of our
priority list and we talk about
economic vitality we're
talking about measureable
dollars is there
a jobs being created is our
business being created
is there money coming into
our community.
Unlike a
tiff
New Mexico stated to do
not have to be created
and blighted
areas so
that's not the downtown
wasn't delighted when
they created it but
if you're thinking about implementing
it 10 model it can be
implemented implemented
and already
thriving
communities.
In 2008 the city
adopted the to
administer pooled plan
it outlines the future
projects our priorities
most of these priorities
have to do with capital
improvement
such as
improving
publicly owned structures
such as the Amador
hotel.
Routine the roadways
at they opened at main
street up to 2 way
traffic
how walkable sidewalks
some of this money was used to
finish the plaza
in downtown Los crucis
also everyone's
favorite traffic feature
in Los crucis around
about that
was funded by the
2 that there was originally
planned to have 2
roundabouts one on
Bowman and one
on committee do you detect the
sarcasm on the.
To. As we don't
know how to drive in round about we do
not hear it is a
rattle.
Just to let you know that
of the greater Las Cruces chamber of
commerce is hosting a reception
force at the end of your life
so you all will be
able to see
the opening to our downtown
and in we
just had a success
with our city council because there
was a building there that was
just awful
that was never going to be developed
that was an eyesore and it
was the entrance to our main
street in our city
council after a whole
lot of trying to negotiate with the
owner deemed
it condemned because
the owner for the last 15 years
refused to do anything with
it.
Let me have madam chair committee
it was honestly the number one
complaint we had about
the downtown when you gonna
fix this building
and in working with the
city they they carried
the water on this one big time
but we're able to work through
ordinances and everything in order
to get this moving so we're
very excited about this this
open up a spot that
hopefully someone else can come in and
build and create another
wonderful small business in our downtown
district and in you'll see
this and and so I I don't I'm
sorry I'm party like interjected
myself and part of your presentation
but you and I get to work together in my
office downtown.
Is that you know we have we've had
you know when when urban renewal
took place a closed off our
main street for those of you who don't
aren't familiar with it
and
you know bless their
hearts for trying to think of something
that was good but it was not good
for our downtown and so
but we have a very strong
and powerful farmers and crafts
market here
I was a vendor at the market
at this time when we had these
awnings on the yellow
paved the yellow brick
road and
when the conversations were talking
about opening this up to
through traffic it was like this
guy was following
however we look at like the farmers
market in Madison which shuts
off an entire street
block right it
is a thriving farmers market so
it's just really getting folks
used to change and comfortable
with change the
challenge was is that we were
having businesses
and I feel comfortable saying this is we
also have landlords were holding on
to properties that work they
work number one improving
them or much less
putting them at a rate that was feasible
for people to read
and so complaining about economic
development yet be the ones we're
stifling economic development which was
very frustrating
that we started getting businesses in
and I still have to credit little toad
creek brewery for really kind of
tipping that because we have
businesses small businesses
that were showing up on our main
street but it wasn't until
this very came in that if pushed
everything over and then everything
else started coming in
and so we have this thriving
downtown our city
government created
the plaza de Los crucis
where there are tons of events
that happen all the
time and it's really
become the downtown that we
wanted
constantly Los crucis as we
don't want to be like to
sun.
And there's some truth to
that. What
it means though we don't wanna be
like to sound is that we don't want to
over grow ourselves without losing
that small town feel.
And so there's a something that we
pride ourselves on in Los
crucis that there
is this you know and many times
it's a good thing of 2 degrees of
separation but sometimes you just
like all my gosh and still
related to them
but that we
we really want to maintain
that closeness and that connect
in this without
losing touch of our neighbors
right and so
our downtown has become really
thriving so one of the parts
of that is the Amador
live the whole complex
that Max Bauer
created and worked with the city
on so it's 3 bars
in one area
and that's really kind of the
entrance to our main street
except for this dilapidated
building that now thanks for city
council will start
getting change but when you see that
building you'll see why it's
been such an eyesore for
over 10 years
and so you know
but but you've got your
work cut out for you because we got a
thriving downtown
and with that comes a lot of different
things we do mail
us about sorry chair thank
you I we appreciate you giving us
that nice shout out for our
downtown it
is working day in and day out
it is butting heads with
our our partners
it is listening
to them tell
us what we need to do better and just telling
them what we need to but to do
better but in the end
are so cool our
sole goal
is to make sure that
downtown Los crucis
drives and again
culturally to our
heritage and becomes
that living room of
downtown
and we wanted to be an example
and I'm looking at Liz over
here we wanted to be an
example and we use an
example of how
we get along with our
our state our local governments
that's including the county
and I'm very support I'm very grateful
that we have our support from the county here
as well as from the city
here today with us
but we've really worked
hard to create these relationships
that let and they understand
how important downtown is
to be thriving so I do
want to give that **** out thank you for
those relationships
sources no not
all when
one issue that our downtown
house that maybe a lot of.
Other communities in New
Mexico don't have
is that we
are not worried
necessarily about people
coming into downtown
as far as tourism what we're worried
about leakage
what we want to keep you here and
make sure that you don't go to a posso
to have this cultural
experiences
so that's one thing that we've always we always
kind of keep the top of our mind is
keeping our authenticity
like Jennifer said not
gentrifying
as part of the city's
municipal planning for
the Ted they really did
a good job of taking into
consideration the
walkability of
downtown so
part I I
not sarcastically.
They the
the the the idea of the
kind of Sita's which
are
these.
Alleyways of the
tiny road to that you
could walk from
one block to another without
having to go all the way around the block
they make our community
so nice so
walkable we're working
with the city this year on getting
that shaded
a really nice places
to set what
Jennifer said we have one of the
largest districts in the
state and
our our goal
is always to make
it pedestrian
friendly and active
transportation
friendly.
Of the ticket in
Los crucis is governed by the 2
board which is city
council plus 1 non
voting county commissioner
which in our cases Shannon
Reynolds and
the board meets quarterly
before the city council workshop
sessions and those meetings are open
to the public
what that does is it
reinvests a gross
receipts tax
a baseline that was
set in
2007 so the
gross receipts tax
that exceed that
baseline or the funds
that are put into the
Ted
so it's never
actually takes money away from
the community it's based on
growth
if you look at
page 7 we
have our 2
revenues
through FY
14 to FY
23 it's really odd
at least for me to think the FY 23
it's over but it
is
so I
I did the
the calculations on FY
23 so
maybe Liz will have some different
numbers on that but
everything else our city
numbers
as you can see the
to has
continued to grow as
far as
revenue
the where it goes down
it starts in 2
and
2019
that is because the state
ended its contribution that
year so it wasn't
because downtown wasn't
growing is just
because 1 of those
revenue streams was taken out
of the equation.
And then you
know we were really
worried and
FY 20 as everyone was
that that our our
ticket number was going to be
negative
we were really concerned that it
we were so grateful
that that it was there it was
pretty robust
like Jennifer said we
were net positive for
new businesses
during the COVID we
had.
Madam chair
and committee we had
our downtown businesses that were
closed and everything what they
did is they work really hard
together in order
to improve
their online
they work with us on how
they.
And again
madam chair this is something I know
you did through
your work and your other work
at was actually
helping our businesses
talk about what they could do
online how they could
maneuver their businesses
if they're retail store how they
could maneuver into online
programming and so
many did it as partnerships
that we do these online
programs it was great
they're able to sell things they
could put things in
front of the store and you
could come pick up this are
project our
restaurants were actually doing
very well because of
the drive up
opportunities they're doing
deliveries and
with the city we're able
to allow them to
create the patios
and so they were able to have
patios outdoor aware
of some of their main streets across
the country actually closed down their main
streets and put seating out
have these large
cafeteria type seating
we're able to have
still creating have small
patios for each of the
restaurants again it was
another way that the
collaboration between
us is a 501 see 3
and our local governments really worked
well together in order to make
sure that the businesses
in downtown I can't
speak to the rest of the city
because it down to my
my 1 of my
main of the.
But we were able to see
that our businesses thrived
and they.
They were hurt but not hurt as
badly as they could have been and we weren't
seeing a lot of closures Google
the businesses that we did see
closure during the
COVID were already
coming we
had one business it only took cash
and they decided they didn't want to do that
anymore so again
those are it's a
lot it's easy to say they closed
because a COVID but knowing
the history and are talking with them
we know those are really the reason
was not COVID.
It could have been a change shortage but
yes.
So if you see
FY
22
this is the state's top
it's
it's to contribution
2019
but in FY
222
giant leader projects
came downtown
1 of those is electronic
caregiver adding
about 900 new
jobs
the other is a 28
studios.
So although
the state was a contributing directly
to the tend to contribute to this
leader projects
really have a need
to has really
expanded
the everyday workforce
of downtown and
just the overall
gross and gross receipts
of
downtown.
I'm going to some of the
projects that the 2 does
this is a nice picture of the
day we actually opened up
main street downtown
after all of the work going back
and forth
we've honestly had people cry
because they hadn't seen it open
and thought it was
really cool thing so I'm really proud
of that day
it is your right here in
their.
Mmhm
so we did we did the opening of
the 2 ways that this is where you see
the **** tat did funds
actually in work so
they can attend Fund has to go point
infrastructure it cannot be
used for let's say
staff art art doesn't pay us
we work with the contract with
the city the city place
us at pace as a sole
source we have a
full first contract with the
city so
but the 10 thing
the ticket money fix
these and we help
promote we help
move we will move the
dial for them
so the opening of the main street
and we did the renovations of the
Rio Grande theatre so if
you're downtown this evening
it is definitely a jewel
of of Los crucis
it is such a pretty place.
Rio Grande theatre.
1932 is that
right I believe so
I'm it is it is
become a meeting place we
we tend to use it for a lot of
our public meetings
it is starting to become
as our plaza is it's also
starting to become a central
figure in our downtown
area we
do there we are working
on parking lot
improvements
a lot of our parking lots are very
old need to be repaid
the infrastructure the plumbing going
into the buildings
electricity going into the buildings
that stuff needs to be okay
updated
as.
Chairman Hamlin will know
is her parking lot has
been under construction
for a long time
we were building a new
bathroom visited
funds we have some
changes that have change orders
big changers I happen
but when all said and done we'll
have a brand new wonderful
public restroom there and
a beautiful parking lot
that will be great for
again for downtown
we you know when that's going to be
finished we
work hold in
3 months
but I'm looking at.
But it could be they found
some the piping wasn't
correct is
that so they had to re
update all the old piping like
still play pipes so that
so again. I
believe that they are going to go back
into the green pipes
sewer usually park
but we were told at 1.3
months but that could change
I'm feeling the facts are
not that's.
Okay I have a loud voice
so I sometimes
don't
the traffic circle as we all told
you about is our one of around about
which I actually love
and the completion of plaza de Los
crucis again which is the heart
and soul I believe of our
downtown as
is any program any
place in New Mexico
you're you're small
your small towns have those
clauses that you create
everything and this opens it up to
vent having vendors having
large events for us
downtown Las Cruces partnership
in the CD we hold
the Chile drop which is our new year's
eve we average about
5000 people at this
it is free to the public
is it because it's
called we have a very
large chrome
chili that is dropped
from a
a crane and
you can vote on it and
no one knows its computer
computer updated
and no one knows what color
it's going to be so as
it comes down and we're counting
when we hit 0 Italy to
be red green or
Christmas so
we really love in 20
foot stainless steel
Chile would like LED lights
all over it and
it's a great way of really
I think Arizona
or maybe it was Albuquerque
Albuquerque Albuquerque wanted to
try and do the same thing but we copy write
it.
I'm
sorry.
Yeah Albuquerque did it twice
but it was a
last year again in in
working with our
visitors is a
Los crucis we're able
to capitalize and get
over
1.$4000000
in free advertising
we hit Good Morning
America they did talk to us
Pacific specifically but
the Chile drop was across
the country and we
feel this year we're gonna be able to do something like
that again it is a
great evening
this past new
year's eve we do we have to
wear jackets it was
it was cool but not
cold band
plays we have music we do we
run it like a we do a almost
like a carnival we have a
mid way you can play games we
have a couple of our
bars downtown work together they
have a beer garden
it really truly is a place
to get people to come
together and we'll be
working with is a Los crucis
again this year and some of the
hotels to work on heads
in beds since we don't get any
of the.
The visitors Tax
we don't get any of that but
our visit Los crucis does so we
want to be able to work with them and get
people to come from all
over the country all of
our state all over community
stay the night come
to downtown
for new year's eve enjoy
themselves state the next day
eat drink and be merry and our
wonderful city
I'm we also have what's called the
zombie walk this started
10 years ago
it is exactly what it
sounds like we
average and I
say this quietly because
the fire Marshall did give me a side
eye we average
about 7000 people at
this again it's a free
event we work with the
city on
people dress up as a zombie
would ever on make up
every it's
it's it's terrifying
yes it's
fun again we
have benders there it
main streets closed down
the business's
downtown the front facing
businesses on main street proper get
involved in it
in order to help and we obviously
permits to these people go to the
businesses but again it's
another large festival
that we do
free.
That is free not we do for you it is
free to the community
and it is a it grows
every year it's really
shocking we
had a 2 year sabbatical because
a comment
and it came back last
year bigger and better than
ever again we try to do
in the midway opportunity options
so we're not paying
out to a whole bunch of vendors
but we're able to have people come
in people start lining
up on main street proper
and we have
a cattle guard
gate that we open
up and the zombies
come out and they
what is the right word seasons
here the shambles down
main street and they sample
on other streets so
the community has to be
aware
that there's the zombie walk
that night because I was driving
on Alameda.
And saw 2 people in
character walking home
from is on the law
and you know and you're giving all these
examples and I want you to keep going
because the thing is is it
it's just really kind of showing these creative
things that little local communities
can do but there's nothing
stopping your area
Representative Armstrong from having
like a zombie walk or
to do something
to drop us a satellite
dish for
your.
Right I mean can you
imagine. My
mind is turning and like I
thought of a great model for you
could be drop it
like it's
hot.
Collaboration's
been.
Drop into it
well and and that's the thing that
that I think that we we
we are getting better at
doing is like sharing these
things are certainly things that were
proprietary over
and that that I think every part of our
state should be but it's like
these ideas that we're
sharing you know because there's
a salsa fest that I've been
able to be a judge because it's such a
hard job
but there's all these different
activities that's where I get
my girlish ribbon just figures
because of salsa fest competition
judging but it's like
all these different things that communities
can do to bring people
together to help their downtowns
thrive if their
downtowns existed
attended then you're
really like starting to have
that trickle into
other areas than just
a creating an event for the community
to constantly absolute
manager I would be Mr big
be remiss to say that
I am also the chair for
the coalition of New
Mexico main streets
and I would suggest
to you we actually had a meeting
last week and
we have sent out
the the
schedule of interim committee
meetings to are their main streets
around the state in order
for them to come to
your your meetings around the
state I think it's important
if you have time if you have a
moment to get in
touch with your main street community if you
have one or your to cultural
district communities
I think it's quite important
because really
a lot of our main street programs around
the state are on the forefront
of the economic development
of things in their same things at the
micro level
which
doesn't always happen you guys
get inundated with big numbers
and all it's it's everything
it's everything all at once and
Susan and I on the
daily deal with
microscopic numbers were dealing
with microbicides
people businesses that have
10 or below
employees businesses that
want to scale up but
are able to
and I think so we talk about
that we don't have it sorry I
get excited but these
are things so that was some of the amenities
so we go on but we do have
some really cool things that we
do have and I just saw as
spell spelling and I
apologize but. We I see
the improvement not because
Calista.
But that's me
but so with the improvements with
high see this again making our
district more walkable
this is step this is things
that are able to happen because they did
monies that we that are invested
and it's being invested back into our
community the
amenities we now have security
patrols on downtown this is
something that the 2
board voted on
we have someone that comes in in the
evening daily 6 in the morning
but they do a car in a drive
around downtown this is
something that's very been very helpful for
us in the downtown
certain times years you start
scene tacking
go up you see broken
windows that type of
step in
a quick measure
of it we have seen tagging
and broken windows go down
in a couple months that this is been happening
so we hope that this continues
to have a positive effect
on our downtown district
and we'll be having cameras
installed we're
going to I think that's going to be
another another
plume in our cap having
the cameras installed to be able to see
what's going on I know not
everyone is excited about
that but when it
comes to the safety
of our of our people
walking down the street of our
people in the downtown I think
this is this is safety for
both sides.
We have the public art and
we're very fortunate to work with
some beautiful amazing
artists here in Los crucis
and one of the things
that you'll see tonight is on the
visit Los crucis building
is a new mural it's
Los crucis peril it is
actually gorgeous one of our
downtown businesses
and business owners on he knew
his did it is absolutely
beautiful she's also
responsible for 2
other murals in downtown
we have the Los crucis postcard
one we also have
our go thrive B.
which current
one of her friends helped us with
and then we have one on the side of
Mexico was books that was a community
mural
that
the dentist only grant help pay
for but it was Community
Meryl and it is a
tree and it shows that
Mexico is our bookstore downtown with
one of the oldest bookstores
in the state freestanding
bookstores
it has been there
through thick it locally it's been
there through thick and thin
and the
depiction is that they
are the water of our downtown
they have been there the state
so it's beautiful the community
was able to come in actually
are artists created
stamps you could put
your stamp on it your
name she did
quotes are the branches of the
tree it's it's a
beautiful mural and it means a lot
it's one of my favorite things I think we have
downtown because of the meeting
and working with the owners of the
businesses I
truly let that there's much
more public art than that and
those are the 3 of the ones that we
particularly are very proud
of we
have the
raps on
our political
or electrical box it was forget the word
electrical boxes around
downtown again
we Commission with artists to
be able to to beautify
these kind of unsightly
things
we also have we're gonna
be updating the music
delivery system in
downtown so
when you're trying through
downtown you will be hearing
lovely music and hopefully
that'll be in place for
Christmas.
I look at Elizabeth Liz Liz
and she's our boss and
so
we'll have that will be able
to really.
Really up.
Upgrade your your visit
to our downtown Los
crucis and these are again
things that if we didn't have that
said we would have to be figuring
out other ways to pay for them
and this is these are
things that.
These things may sound
small for
a little reduce like why do you want music
down count will I don't know
those you live in Albuquerque whatever
you go to the uptown
it is something that people
enjoy is hearing the music
as they're going from store to store
it helps with you at
home sure shoppers down
it it has a
really wonderful effect on
people into the down in your
areas so again
these are things that we find are very
important and
that will actually help us grow
our downtown.
You
sure.
So the upcoming 2
projects for FY
24
we talk about the downtown security
that's the patrols as well as the
cameras
main street and kind of see the
public art of
that public art is
$15000
it's for the epic it's for
the maintenance of
it
facility maintenance is at
1.6000000 of that
is parking lot
improvements
Hey
flaws of the deposit
maintenance the Amador
hotel which
is another blighted
structure at the
entrance of her main street
that the city has been working
on for quite awhile
Stewart yes so
much it means a lot to
our community is one of the few
historic buildings that
survived
urban renewal so
the city through Ted funds put
about a million dollars a
year into that
project and
then we have Campos
street the
redesign project the city's
already paid for the study for
that essentially
Campos street is a street
that divides our
downtown and our
historic neighborhood behind
it if
you cross composter you've
know that you're taking your life into
your own hands
so it
just.
Within it is it
is it is a historic
district there are houses there there are
over 100 years old there are families
that have lived there for
generations
and there's one of my favorite
restaurants in that area and we have a to
see the a
Latino owned businesses
but they're they're certainly
it just for your also
references the mountains here but
you the mount your run north
and south so
when we are going to be at our
reception tonight we're going to be
at the south end of main
street I would strongly
recommend that you take
a walk it's only 7 blocks
it's and actually I would even walk
it because I'm such a to play about
walking but
it's it's up
it's doable it we've
got.
Excuse me a number of there's
coffee shops
there's there's bars is
a comic book shop there's
also an
adult arcade
meaning that goes adult their agency
they serve alcohol they're not adult
thing not until thing
thank you Jenny
knows me
but their pinball machines
arcade games there's a bar
there you know there's
all sorts of things that are going
and when you talk about the case see
those those are just little
little arteries off
and so really making
the most of those little things
off of our main street to really
make it a full complete experience
right I mean I think with the ticket
has really done for our
district has made a canvas
for development and I
think we I think we take
it for granted and I think
the purpose I mean if the city
is run well you never think about
being in the city right you
never think about your solid
waste where that
goes right until there's a
problem and
it's it's kind of the same for
for the rest of you
know urban life
right it's
our downtown is
been so revitalized
through the Ted
that I think we
are able to
live in this Rome
of the styles that were re some
people say I really wish
we still had a Luby's we
hear that a
lot.
Where they want to Montgomery
Ward for murder
rewards
but I I think
we we say to when
we hear those kind of things you know
that today is
everyone was among if
someone's good old days
right so
we really have this great
campus to work on
work from I don't
think anyone would
applaud the decision
of urban renewal
but one thing it did give us
was the opportunity to
build the downtown that
Los crucis wants and
deserves serves
so if you can
look at the you know your glass half
full I think
that's probably it for
us the best way to look at it right
we can't bring back on
stage interviews or Luby's
are recovery wards but we can
make a really wonderful
place for people to have
cultural experiences
in our community.
I hope you madam chair
Committee I hope you guys can
tell Susan
I love our job we really
love what we're able to do in
downtown we love Los
crucis and I
think I think
at the end of the day that is
starting this really shows
and I just I I
can't explain press to
you enough again it was
ridiculously
how emotionally we are tied to
the Ted ed because if it
wasn't for the ticket into the embrace
we would not have this district
thriving the wait is is there
room for improvement absolutely
are we here to try to improve that
absolutely but we're
so grateful that we have this
wonderful stepping stone to help
move us forward
I'm on page
what is this page 9.
Page 10 which you'll see is
a snapshot of
our 2 jobs and reinvestment
in FY
2023
this is what
season I reported to the
city
in
August of this month
option yeah this
over this past year we
were through micro businesses
we were able to bring
in and it's not
because I'm just when I say we please
understand I mean downtown
as a whole not Susan and
Jennifer alone
downtown was able to bring in
76 new jobs
and plus 700
71 jobs with electronic
caregiver I do not like
putting that into our
our. How many
jobs ripping down all the time
we're very proud to have electronic check
care giver in our district
however I do also want
to always be able to put forth
the small business and local businesses
and micro businesses
first
we have seen about
3.6000000 in
private improvement that's
from that new businesses coming
in updating their
buildings
helping.
Tear downs different
things again with the
eyesore building come in we'll see what
kind of improvement that
brings
the 3.7000000 in public
improvement comes through from
with the city has been
doing in the
district
and was you can see it coming
we've had 19 you businesses
open in downtown Los
crucis and arts and
cultural district this past
year in
most of these again my
wrists they are micro
businesses they are
people
they're coming in and it's maybe
them or 1 other person running these
businesses
but they're doing well and they're
working hard and they're becoming part
of the community
with the 6 but we have 6 pending
projects that
we have coming this over
this next year
we at that we know of
specifically right now
1 will be a new restaurant a
new coffee shop
another actually the beauty and
wellness center we can mark that off they
opened last weekend
another dispensary
we're working with some people in
regards to a boutique hotel
downtown and we also
have a 28 studios
which again that was provided
J. took money leave the money
but they have a space a large
space that they purchased downtown
that they're looking to do some sort of
collaborative effort in bringing
some at another restaurant
and small businesses to
share their
space so
we're really excited to work on that
project with them
going into page
11
we as
a main street as a main program
that is a main street program really
want to see keep our our
district thriving and
so our areas of
focus
really run for business
retention for the businesses that
are there how are we helping
them stay there what
are we what can we do to help
them stay in downtown Los
crucis or what can we
do to help them expand these are
really big and
really. Really
high points priorities
for us
we also are recruiting
businesses we are
working with
the revitalization
specialist at the New Mexico
mainstreet to do avoid
analysis to see what's
missing and that comes back
into what Susan was speaking of earlier
when she was talking about the
leakage people going to el
Paso to
go school back to school shopping
well why are they going back to
school shopping in el Paso when
they could actually do that same here
white what can we do to
make that more easier for
them and understand that they have
the stores downtown that they can come
to or not I'm just downtown
like we have our mall we have our things
but really trying to keep local
dollars
local.
We also really work hard
on district wide promotion
so we try to find anything that's
happening in our district we
really work hard to market
and advertise those
things to invite people into
downtown
get we've been very
very lucky with
our relationships with
Center Hamblen
with Senator
Steinborn and
are.
You too this is our
I work with that you guys have been so
helpful in just when we've gone to
the state now for capital outlay
money we
I don't know if we have it in
their kids okay so
I'll get to that a second I'm ahead of
myself
the value added that we see
is with us being a main
street program and working within that
it is Susan I are
both actively both
have economic
development certification
that we had to get to be
a main street program
director
and we are
continuously we are doing
continuing ad through through
that and through main street
our board which we have a few of
our board members here which I'm very grateful
for
they are
volunteer based and so
they spend a lot of their time
just coming in and out of the
businesses in downtown checking
on them so I'm
really grateful to that that's something
that we add
that it's it's not
everything's not always on the
high tear it
is.
It is every level of it were
every level of things are going
on in our district
we do one on one technical
assistance and business
consulting you want to
come in to work with
us and talk to us
about creating a business
plan where those people
we can help get people
in touch with
they were looking for type of
building so we wear
the hat of a
real state agent a business
manager
not a banker but we really
try to work to help people
find where they can find
funding.
We do get requests
we we really we
live off of grants grants and
funding streams through district
projects and programs so most
of things that happened downtown
come through requests through
our relationship our contract
with the city and our contract
with the
county.
We we
probably know the
district better than most
some things we don't know but we're not
afraid to learn and if we don't know we'll
find out and we
will we will help get to the next
point our
district advocate advocacy
work
every point in again what we
do is we want downtown
to thrive we care about
our businesses the aren't
just businesses they are
community they are what
they make us
successful so if we're
not advocating for them that
we are not doing a good job at our
job you want to
sure one example
of this is we work with the
county to
do a
study we called
it proxima posso
that will pass and the state
backwards where
we it was a telephone survey
which we expected to get like a
5 percent response we got
25 percent
response of small
businesses and and a corporate area
the county
and through this
process we
really learn that some of our
assumptions about how business
works or assumptions
and not facts
me specifically I just
thought that you know poverty
was an impediment to starting a
business actually we found
that it's the impetus
to start a business and a lot
of cases
and and this
missing middle as
far as capital
is the biggest issue it's
not start up capital because
these businesses start and
back room or garage
right they're needed
they're making half their making pot
holders whatever it is
but it is access
to capital to scale
so it is
do can I get this business
big enough for I can hire another
ploy I can buy a piece of
equipment
I can find a bigger
space
to make it to that next level
were is not just a side hustle
it it's my only hustle
or do I have to figure out a
way to scale this back down
so it fits back in my
garage and I
and I and I get another
job.
Right so
that that conversation
is is a conversation
that we've been having with our
community
and something things that we
learned through that
that program
we're really glad that you guys
are addressing it we were
calling it the agency
missing middle we were
just saying people can't
scale which missing
middle sounds a lot better than
that.
Did we also do advocacy
for our communities
with you guys with our
legislators
with our city
and with our county so
we are a
lot of times the the
face
of downtown and and
this forward
is working CFO heard facing
conversations
about what our district needs
and how we can
help. Some
of the other
areas.
Some of the other things that we have a value
added is we have a direct connection
with New Mexico mainstreet
and with them they have revitalization
specialist that really
count are
the 4 parts of that we talked
about earlier so we can reach
out to them and they can help
again build business plans
they are helping again with that like we're
talking earlier the void analysis
working with the business
even
how they can update the
front of their facades
get the little costs how to
keep things in
the sense of
here it not here to excuse
me
historic if it's a story building how
they can do these things everything
that we do
with the Mexican street again it's
always about the
heritage it's always going to be about
that community and making sure that
we're not the racing who we are
as people
I'm this but over
the last few years Dick
Dale C. P. was able to
get 3000000 little over
3000000 in capital outlay
funds
in order to do a light to
project a lighting project in
the misty historic district which is
part of arts and culture district
as well as
of.
I always forget the way the
gateway pylons excuse
me to
differentiate with our districts
are we
were able to get
2 different
2 different legislative sessions we
were able to get
I think we rate it
$1000000
a little over one in one
provided little under the other
and I do want to say again I want to
say to you guys as committees specially
are are doing Ana
County legislators
I appreciated when each one of you
guys talked to me afterwards and
said Hey I can't go
for this because I'm helping get money to
this but we're going you
know everyone spoke to
me and spoke about
how important our community was
and how important downtown was
in they saw the value in what
we were trying to bring into downtown
Los crucis
and then we this past year
we received $900000
for New Mexico mainstreet
in order to complete the lighting
and the gateway pylons
in
downtown.
To wrap up.
Downtown's bright future
we have continued public
and private reinvestment things we've
already really talked about we've
had a lot of changes in property owners
downtown which has been a real
bright spot
and down and this property
or owners have
really kind of come to us
and listen to what we said
about retail
that to have a commercial district we
have to have more retail
and really working with us
to find micro
businesses
that
that will fit within their
space
the also are those
businesses that need
foot traffic downtown is really
the only place with the traffic outside
the mall to
survive
and that we're hoping
or growing generational wealth
that's what we hope for for all of our
our small businesses
we the city has a run
of a main street grant because
of the MRA I'm is
not funded through the Ted is funded
through the general fund
where we have a
grant to that
$25000 of
matching funds can be applied
to any
project
that improves the
building for a
eatery a
entertainment establishment
or a retail
so we're the
city does a fantastic job
administrative not I'm
it really has made a difference
in our downtown with and the city is
about 80 here.
It's it's it madam chair
committee it is a great recruitment
tool it is something that when we
are talking to businesses that they
have the access to this capital
again
the it it does it
can be up to 25000
so even if it's 10000
whatever these these are things that
make make it easier
for businesses to open
and when we are recruiting these businesses
and we are telling them about
these these programs that
they have we're looking at this
in the long run and for the long
haul we don't want to open up a
business it's just going to be here for 2
months something that we talk
to people just because you make good
brownies does not make you
the owner of a bakery
and that's very hard to
tell people sometimes because you
don't want to crush a dream but
you also so we
when you talk about the risk earlier
really the front lines on some of
that risk and saying okay what
are your long term goals how do you see
yourself in 5 years
really having this conversation
about them do you know how much money
you really need to be making daily
in order to keep up with your overhead
so we
we ask the hard questions sometimes
people don't want to hear the answers
or they don't know how to answer but we
get them there and so I can
like say way back
through these incentives
and the renovate mainstreet is a
really good way for helping us with
our recruitment.
I'm we've already talked about
our capital outlay
projects
which are really kind of
coming to for sure having community
meetings soon about the lighting
in the ski I think they're gonna be in
October we're really excited about
that and
we that we as we said earlier
the state's Lida
contributing to this large
projects in our district has made a
world of difference for
us.
I'm so we have some
really great good debt
problems in that
we don't have a lot of
street level retail
space left.
A lot of some of that is because there a lot of
churches that moved
in one property was
really really inexpensive down
there is particularly on main
street we have 8
churches in our
district
we have 8
banks in our
district
so.
Of all the money.
So like I
said parking lot improvements
and all this can talk about
a parking structure with I will not
talk about today because we don't have time
for that
the public restrooms as
she the added security
other amenities
right this expansion of
public art which is maybe our districts
and memorable
and the
building it reviews
and new
construction
we're hoping that
we and we know that the city's
priority is
to add
some new construction at that is
mixed use so retail
and housing
as a project like that could
be arts base for the additional
the feasibility study for that
we're looking for funds are face
to but
that you know adding
that layer of housing units
a new retail
space
really opening up our downtown
to some new possibilities were
I mean the future is really bright
far for our
district.
Thank you I
appreciate you you being here and
I think ultimately kind of the theme
of our day today has
been all of the
different things that we have both at the
local and state level that can
help our communities thrive and
and the examples that were presented
today throughout the day
I really things that can be brought
in anywhere it's
just you know this is kind of like a
I use this is like this is kind
of the skeleton structure
of what this
community has really
magnified
but that you know there are certainly
the bones of any of this that
any community can use
and I and I do want to to
stress and we and I think it's all
fairly evidence everybody on the
collaborations as release
a commitment from the city
from the county that we've got groups
that are working together
that are really recognizing that
our end goal is to make sure that our
downtown thrives in my
case that our businesses
thrive and
that our community has a
quality of life which is I know where
the city comes in as well
and so
I I hope it and I
hope you all kind of get the the
passion and the the love that we
have for our community
and especially
on something that many of us have
seen you know really
come from kind of the
ashes downtown was not
the best place to be for many
many years it was just a ghost
town except when we
had the farmers market on
Saturdays and so
now we're seeing this as a
thriving area of our
city and really kind of returning
as the hard because
there's so many people and I bet
Representative about coming out are
you going to talk about this as the heart
of our community
you know it in the early days
of Los crucis it was just
driving the Rio Grande
theatre where the stores
were there was the the
the shake shop and
and
it was where people
were it's where people state
and so
you know I love that it's come back to
that and that we get to experience
that witness that
I think it's an incredible honor that we
get to see all
the work that people have done over the
last several decades
to bring it back where it is
so I do have
Representative about coming. I don't
know if anybody else wants to either ask a
question or make a
comment.
Tires lady.
Thank you so I
too am so very
proud so I want to madam
chair and
compliment all of our you
know on legislators
and to your hard work
because I've seen it
before during
after and then again
New many
times in
my mouth
I won't say how many years in my
lifetime
but I I will give you
a.
A little stamp of approval
that came from a very important
person.
That stamp of approval came
from.
We were made
for and my cousin
who's a former state Rep Mary
Helen Garcia.
I had this great idea
to bring my father
who is in his nineties
he was born in
1920 in Los
crucis
so she had
this great idea
I think he was 93 or
90 fourth the time
to bring them into a
drive
through.
And I and and senator asked
me what your I can't remember
exactly but my
husband and other family
members we brought in a drive
through downtown just
after we had had dinner or
lunch or whatever it was that we
had.
And her
mission was to ask
him what was
over here uncle beetle and
what was over here uncle beat
though and what was over
here.
And you know
he pointed out and
named what
he could recall growing
up the
businesses that were on
this side and then he
says. You people
got all this wrong
you laid it out wrong
you need to put this business
back over here
and he's
correcting
everything in my
Mary Helen was taking notes of
all of this and
she the same okay
uncle B. to we'll be they cut
his name was Philippe it through
he avoid but.
But they call them PED
people and for short
people so
she he made no
she was making notes and then
he passes by
the Rio Grande is theater
and.
He had wanted to get down because
he had difficulty walking
Committee
poker and he
wanted to get down and he
wanted to walk.
Whatever he could
little bit around the
area and
still recalling we were picking
his brain and
then she
said why don't I
take a picture of you
right in front of the plaque
of the Rio Grande and
so I was just showing
the Senator the picture and
I don't want to cry but it's one of
our last pictures.
Of
him.
This is very meaningful to
me. I'm
so.
Representative I hope you're able to drive
downtown again tonight I'm sorry
I know that I know residential
place they stayed listening
to everything and this is
been a great
contribution
to our families I guess
state
and and
I do want to say thank you
keep up the good work I
am a firm believer and
tickets
and the and how effective
they work
and.
And the greatest glory we
have with seeing the smile on his
face walking through
and being able to identify
but more importantly
tell us that we still had a job
to do and that was to correct
some of the placements
of of those
just because they were
quite adequate
but anyway
I felt it was important to
relate that because
that's a
legacy
that.
Comes from being part
of a pioneer family of this
town and
3 generations
and then being able to
leave that legacy
the other side of my family as
I can't remember the name of the
the most state park what is the
name of the mosaic park
the use that they use
claim park.
Claims
that might the other side of my
family whose father
is that
the the cacique
it of the you don't want
to try that depend
on so I
think that's
that side of the family so we
took him through that and that was
just even more emotional
moment because he thought
that his
tribe and his indigenous
background have been forgotten
in this area and so
to see his father.
In his full
on ceremonial
and to know that it
was the young people
that had done the most
think that probably
was even.
A stronger enrollment
of attachment for
him because
growing up in the 19
twenties as
a. Mexico in
Mexico Indian boy
in this.
Count was
not something to be proud
of and
he his sense
of pride was
restored
in seen his
father on in the
most sake and that
you gave tribute
to the people month's will try
and so I wanted to
thank the senator
because she's been a real strong
proponent of New
supporter in the
Senator here's been a dear
dear friend through all
to our family and
all that have
preserved these moments
of history that are so very
important so this
is a true story
of the impact that it's had and
I just wanted to convey that
thank you madam chair thank
