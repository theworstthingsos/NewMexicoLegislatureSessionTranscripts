The thirty eight applications

yes ma'am course.
That Senator month is if you can

course unanimous consent has
been asked force will have to
deal with that as well.
pictures on the floor on some a
rule that we all with all
cameras notice violate often so
just giving you a hard time
district maybe they'll be a
shorter list.
Thank you Mr president thank you

that are not from the district
but they do represent the rest
IT thank you Mr president

rural New Mexico first
Bernalillo county and this is a
case where Bernalillo county is

money is divided out since we
don't see any money in the bill.
from this list thirty eight
projects were chosen in twenty
four counties.
Mr president the senator do you
know what the criteria was for
them to be picked.
Mr president Senator Brandt the
based on this toward needs are
and and the higher needs get
picked before the lower needs is
that would that be.
About right.
one project on the list and and
should be number one is the
southern Santa Fe county or
rural and flood control forty
four
Thank you Mr president center I
understand that but but we're
almost neighbors so you're
would probably Bernalillo but
from for me the number one

severance taxes originate where

from.
Oil and gas and mineral
extraction thank you very much
Mr president and so I'm not
going to ask you how much of
that money is returned to
to represent an area that.
Provides that type of funding
for these kinds of projects
which are very important and I
appreciate very much your caring
impact and the contribution that
is made to the state of New
Mexico from the oil and gas
industry thank you very much.
Thank you senator in we do have

Thank you senator gave us any
further debate we do have for
the debate Senator thank you Mr
president so we've of if the
Sanchez deal to just a but one

Based on some of the things I've
seen around here million dollars
doesn't go very far can we
Mr president center share.
I don't have the answer for that
for each one of these projects
trying to figure out how we make
sure we finish something too
many things just hang out there
for too long.
but again a senator Morris is

projects approved you know how
many projects were denied.
Mr president Senator Griggs I do
not.
Senator you know that Senator

brought up you know great point
Senator Moores brought up some
other points but the at the fact

Baca than to close this out to

water storage convenient
conveyance and delivery project
Mr president with the sponsor
pope is that a is that like
pumps and pipes to get water to
houses and for people to drink
and that that sort of thing.
Thank you Mr president you know
what I'm pointing out here is
just that you know and some of
the parts of the state I live in
I happen to live in an area that
having to put in you wells
keeping the sanitation levels
high levels because for that
clean water is necessary so I
and the fact that you know the
the amount of the money I think
is is adequate to because I know
a lot of times at least a in
this particular municipality of
projects and that more people
and so there is a real value
there that affects the lives of
New Mexicans and and their
quality of life so thank you
a moment to Senator serve on
this.
To speak to the Senate is about
this.
Thank you Mr president
predicting hearing.
We can hear you clearly Senator.
Senator pope today but very
candidly it would have been a
lot easier for him if we had
done the traditional freshman
that I'd like to address that
have been brought up in the
debate their good points there's
been some question about the
rural versus urban of nature of
some of the projects and let's
underserved in rural parts of
the state and all I'll tell you
that one of the greatest
beneficiaries of this of funding
this project over the years has
been the Gallup McKinley.
basic water services and so
that's been a big recipient
another big recipient of this
funds over the years been to you
project which those of you on
the eastern part of the state
know full well that we're living
those parts of the state don't
have the resources that some of
the urban areas like where I
come from have as alternatives.
I'd like to also emphasize the
know Senator Wirth has a an
effort to try and change the
composition of the Interstate
Stream Commission but so that my
Senate colleagues no additional
composition of this book of the
border reviews these projects is
the majority composition is is
US state secretary HSD had state
engineer at cetera.
My my experience and then this
may not be fair but my
experience is that usually the
got one now but the that that's
kind of a rarity and the in our
US secretary mccamly so the
water trust board composition it
is usually made up of folks who
unexpectedly saw vetoes pretty
consistently so I I need to try
it with this administration and
I'll make a commitment to this
body that that all do so that
that sixteen member board looks
proud used to be just so you all
remember is look as recently as
four five years ago what we
would do is we'd come to the
session and we would approve
every project that that
would leave it to the water
transport after the session to
go and do the work to select the
projects.
I've had the opportunity chair
this board for a number of times
and so that today your same
projects that have been through
that that vetting process and
the criteria was just little bit
about what that criteria is I'll
tell you a little bit about the
other money only makes sense
that we can get some money from
these projects and use it to
capitalize on that with federal
or other matching monies because
then we're multiplying the
impact of this money that's one
projects piecemeal the the
funding here's what's gonna
projects that are ready to go
and and that's an important
criteria another important
criteria is that we look to the
for communities that that don't
have water that that are running
into crisis situations we've
seen communities have into
deliver water of of by the by
director whether she's been
helping to run this program
we're really just shepherded for
a number of years and and let's
be candid in the last year we've
given her all kinds of
years this is been there project
they've come a long way we've
done it together what we should
be up I'm proud of that is the
Senate and we should recognize
that we can do the same thing
extractive industries.
And the importance they play in
many ways that we seem to always
forget and overlook and and this
is a good reminder and I
appreciate my colleagues doing
that the notion that we shut
trying to keep that in mind with
my boats in the conservation
committee I thank you Mr
president thank you to sponsor
for letting me do this remotely
Senator pope thank you.
Thank you Senator on this.

for giving me this opportunity I
want to thank Marquita Russel
for being an expert on this bill
the members could all stand up
and let's give Senator Paypen
huge welcome New Mexico senator.
Thank senators are gone too item
number two will be Senator
Stewart.
Mr president I ask unanimous
amendment or substitution I see
no objections Senator Stewart to
explain the bill.
Thank you Mr president.
It currently has one point seven
three billion dollars and.
It had zero and twenty
seventeen.
when downturns.
So this bill.
Talked about the relationship
between the two.
This bill would change that
percentage to fifteen percent.
It is centrally would mean that
Which currently has one point
seven three billion dollars.
The other change this would
make.
Is that the.
reserve before it goes into the
tax stabilization act.
This is a little bit of an
esoteric conversation here.
more flexibility and a little
bit more ability to use funds
because we can use them in the
operating reserve.
This does not change the set up
of the tax stabilization reserve
we would still need two thirds
vote both the house and the
Into the early childhood fund
that we created.
So we would still remain these
So I'm sure they'll be questions
Mr president I stand for
questions.
Senator Stewart we do have
debate on the bill we have
Senator Woods.
Madam protium a notice in the F.
R..
That this fund started in
And FY fifteen.
In FY sixteen the balance was
zero.
was.
Five hundred and twenty seven
million five hundred and twenty
six point eight million.
Would you would you comment
Mr president and the senator in
twenty seventeen.
Former representative Larry
Leri act passed house bill one
ninety one and we passed it over
here.
significant more reserves in
eighteen nineteen and twenty is
because of that bill.
So we essentially tried to
into in a rainy day fund a true
rainy day fund that's hard for
us to get into and I haven't
changed any of those parameters
reserve cap was so low.
So by increasing the operating
reserve cap from eight percent
to fifteen percent.
Thank you for that answer Madam
pro tem.
It was just automatically empty
one what is that go to zero in
those two years Mr president.
Mr president so Senator that was
stabilization reserve fund and
we stopped using that that when
you see twenty twenty one it's
one point seven three billion
We had.
Maybe I should read this little
closer before started asking
questions and I apologize to you
Let's see on the next chart over
it talks about recurring general
fund revenues and appropriation
annual growth in it talked about
a negative.
So I guess the point I was
trying to make.
Was that we are trying to create
a a rainy day fund.
But we wanted to make a sure
enough a permanent fund.
That could be tapped without a
congressional without a
constitutional amendment.
economic downturn.
And I'm.
I'm pretty well convinced myself
course I can't okay I'm not a
economist.
We've been a pretty big economic
downturn right now.
And when I talked to my business
then back home.
I certainly believe that they
are an economic downturn.
doesn't make money government
only.
Gets money from the tax payer
through taxation.
And.
Then we have to have a different
source income coming in or cut
program.
haven't had to cut any program.
To me this funds right here even
though you say it's an excessive
amount.
Probably next year now may be
the federal government can keep
sending us federal money.
For many many many more years.
But.
I have a hard time believing.
finance but this is my reasoning
for that.
So Mr president thank you for
the opportunity thank you madam
protium for your answers.
Ingle then Senator about this
Senator Moores thank you Mr
president and then pro time I'll
be very brief I'll be merciful
you ask my first question I
thought their whole purpose was
that we could not tap this and
now there with oil and gas the
way it is revenue so this
picture looking work like it is
I'm not grasping Mr president of
pro tem why we need to do this
Thank you Mr president Senator
Moores so first of all this bill
does not change the tax
stabilization reserve it remains
spend any of that that it would
take a two thirds vote of both
houses and a proclamation from
the governor none of that is
hasn't been changed in many
years for taking it from eight
percent to fifteen percent of
prior year appropriations.
just decided never to use it and
the other one is for emergency
and you've got a couple hundred
dollars and that that's all
we're talking about this having
that operating reserve.
you see from the FIR.
It's about fifty million a year
more that would be in the
operating Sir.
Thank you Mr presentation madam
just a little more flexibility
for help what and it's still
reserve it's not a check.
we can use the operating reserve
with a majority vote and that's
madam pro ten please yield for a
few questions certainly.
Thank you and Mister president
then pro tem um.
I drive drive down to Roswell
and so it was gets me thinking
about him what a wonderful man.
to be so dependent to the boom
and bust in oil and gas Mr
president and then pretend would
you agree with me.
want to thank those industries
for funding our schools and
government so this is not about
that this is adjusting the to
agreeing with I just need to say
it differently that what what
bothers I think us on both sides
the all is that not the fact
that we have money for gas but
it is it is the potential boom
this fund is about and I used to
be an electrical engineer and I
think of a perfect if I could
get a little nerdy for just one
second a perfect analogy is an
the current is just nice and and
steady and so for me this tax
stabilization fund it's an ACDC
converter it takes the the oil
and so as I was listening to the
the debate
What what what concerns me is
that we have a rare.
understanding of bi partisanship
of this boom and bust cycle.
But my my main my main problem
is we have set up this mechanism
that is getting rid of the boom
and bust and it's giving us a
more steady stream of income and
yes right now it does have a lot
For me yes it's a reserve fund
but it in essence when it is a
rainy day.
It kind of becomes a checking
account it becomes much easier
two thirds vote of the Senate
and two thirds vote of the house
and a proclamation from the
governor easy then I would say
yes.
Mr president and senator yeah if
if the economy totally closed
brought up and everything goes
south then it's easier to get it
It is very easy to put money
into this account when it's a
sunny day.
And it's very easy to get money
a body to just think about that
that this is not set up to be
difficult it's not it's hard to
get money out now because it is
a sunny day it is still sunny
this industry but a because of
the political nature of of oil
and gas everything else that it
it is going to go down at some
point and if we just leave it
alone it will become very easy
because it it's not a static
thing I mean it's it's dependent
on our revenues and I think that
this taxable vision fund was set
Incurring risks to oil and gas
boom and bust and I think we we
disagree there I see the the
shaking head of the but but if
if it becomes what what we're
day it will become this that tax
stabilization fund will receive
less money is that correct Mr
president no this bill does
operating reserve which is quite
different then the tax
stabilization act this does not
change the tax stabilization act
it puts a little bit more into
And measures the mechanisms for
getting funds it will continue
to grow it doesn't do anything
with the one point seven three
billion now that's in there.
have gone into the the other pot
you know that that's what I'm
saying and and so in in in sunny
and sunny day times we're we're
shifting where that money goes
in in in tinkering with this.
Into and times we have sunny
days we're not going to be
preparing as much for the rainy
days where once again it's very
Thank you thank you Mr president
present most the questions that
I was going to ask have been
discussed and talked about but
the simplicity of this thing is
tax stabilization reserve will
whatever whatever goes in there
will go in there and that's not
this that that that hasn't been
touched but we're just doubling
can't support it because I think
it's a.
I think we in the legislature.
Have to be be careful how our
your some of your really ability
to govern thank you thanks
Senator Ingle further debate
sentence about this.
Thank you senator about this
Senator Candelaria.
Thank you Mr president Mr
present with the sponsor yield.
Mr president that is correct
president with the infusion of
federal money expected in the
state.
may very well be that a lot of
that money is appropriated by
the near future.
Mr president what I've heard is
that our research could be at
forty five percent pretty soon
after we get federal money.
Is used when disasters strike is
that not correct Mr president
that's correct.
President
when we talk about the operating
reserve we are really talking
about our state's ability to
hedge against disaster.
disaster comes in different ways

unfortunate fortunate challenge
Mr president of dealing with
COVID nineteen.

us how many years ago was that.
Mr president those in twenty
seventeen.
We got along just fine before
that without it.
I remember the early days of of
of my service in the Senate if
economic downturn.
This year we're going to have at
least thirty five percent.
Maybe with the federal money
That at least eight percent.
We would we would we would be
able to to we only take money
into the I mean at a fifteen
That's always been a dream to
have that much in operating
reserves.
This is not in any way a
dangerous step this is a step
That can only happen at some
time way in the future we've
never been able to to really
sound measure I don't think
there's any danger at all
involved in this and I think the
Senator bringing it forward
thank you Mr president thank you
senator anticipate a further
debate we as senator Neville.
not I don't want to debate that
necessarily but just to clarify
in the
Tax stabilization is a little
over a billion dollars is that
point seven three billion that's
correct that's that's what I
wanted to get it not multiple
billions of Senator Ortiz Y.
Pino said it's a little over a
billion something out and
remember the number and that's
that not the possibility Mister
president senator.
Mr president.
Yes it will thank you look at
reserves so we can deal with the
emergency issues that we have in
the state now when those
operating research scope of
fifteen all that money goes
there will be a little bit less
going into the tax stabilization
reserve only if we continue to
have a huge economy.
A little bit less it's the
Less money going into the the
the rainy day fund is what it
amounts to and I just wanna make
sure that everybody understands
that we're gonna be putting less
in the rainy day fund good I
they're not I don't I'm not
Is that if I got it summarized
pretty good Mr president yes and
if you look at your FIR you know
that shows the fifteen million
percent and it goes and if we
don't we don't.
The Senate it's easier to use
the operating reserve dollars
that's that's the point here
you're trying to get more money
understand why you're doing it I
just want everybody to
understand that we're
conceivably making a smaller LFC
in the future a smaller tax
stabilization or rainy day fund
Brandt.
Thank you Mr president with the
sponsor yield Senator Stewart
deal yes I will.
Well Mister president Senator
Brandt I've I've been looking at
this for several years but two
years ago I asked the department
it was in the tax stabilization
act.
And I suggested that we had
maybe taken too much off the top
and he agreed with me.
So then I went to the LFC and
they walked me through all kinds
of options and they said you
know the operating reserve
Doesn't mean you can spend
anymore because it will still be
in the reserves would be to
raise the percent and the
operating reserves before it
takes into the tax stabilization
the difference of how we access
money from the operational
reserve verses the tax
stabilization reserve.
last few years when the economy
tanked it's an emergency reserve
that we can use with a majority
vote
tanks and we have no money I
think then of government could
use some of that tax
stabilization act.
reserve is that correct and it
would take a two thirds majority
to access the tax stabilization
reserve.
Mr president that's exactly
right.
Thank you I appreciate that I
thing and figure out exactly how
those to interact.
Mr president Senator so if we
had a fifteen percent.
becomes fifteen percent the next
year we're building our budget.
Could we then use that money in
the operational reserve or would
little less solid with what I'm
saying but essentially it's like
the reserves that we can use if
we need to but it would first
have to come out of the LFC and
then it would have to come out
floor it's a financial issue so
when they are crafting the
budget they can try to use the
operational reserves.
Thank you Mr president center
and I think that's probably
money and then it flows
hopefully flows back in we don't
know I think the other thing
that really concerns some in
this chamber.
Is quite frankly some of the
One particular bill if it passed
we have to have a hundred fifty
thousand percent reserve to
possible at this point until we
see how certain bills come
through and quite frankly how
certain federal action ends up
For drilling on public land.
the the.
the reserves won't be nearly
For the the fracking ban bill.
will directly applies to the
fracking ban that the president
And the reservation to change
this this year comes from.
Is we really need to see what's
going to happen with the current
concerns over being able to have
access to that the reserve you
know the purpose of that
reserve.
Was that we have seen oil prices
So but you know we've had one
point we're oil was at thirty
dollars a barrel actually in
this last year drop below that.
So just in the last nine years
and that just shows how up and
down the price of oil is in that
really affects our budget so the
purpose of this.
next year and do increases so
everyone could have something
that they could rely on when it
came to budgets and so I think
that's the concern
the law continue to listen and
appreciate it Senator but we do
have for the debate Senator
Griggs.
Thank you Mr president with the
What the issues actually gonna
do what the mechanism is
there's going to be less money
Mr president and and senator we
were going from
From eight to fifteen.
I don't know what the argument
How you determine that you
wanted to use a ten fifteen
versus.
Eight in ten or fifteen intent
last several years my concern
was this fund seem to big for me
I had a bill last year it was
too complicated I abandoned that
four different options the
options are rejected were
options that changed the tax
stabilization act in any way.
The option they gave me was the
fifteen percent so all of the
options that I accepted that's
what that's one that will that I
accept.
That is just a reminder to go to
the chair.
been looking at it.
You were just looking at a at a
way to to change it somewhat the
numbers we're not really your
there for different options a
rejected the two that changed
the tax stabilization act and
picked the one that dealt with
the operating reserves.
Mr president not at this time.
Thank you Mr president thank you
madam pro to.
Thanks Senator Griggs any
further debate senators.

esoteric way of looking at
things a not being on finance

the future and I would like to

department of health to look at
why it is that women are dying
at very high alarming rates
actually there was a twenty
birth or within a year after
giving birth and so we finally
decided be a good idea how long
over due to get a committee
established to of professionals
overdoses or substance abuse or
other factors that could be
involving that this this budget
scenario and so this year we
have African Americans in this
committee we need to add at
least two of each to make it
more diversified and Sarah and
trauma that is being imposed on
women during the time of the
pregnancy and they are to get
trained on the trauma related
are able to use so it does not
have any fiscal impact for a

study here so that's what we're
looking at in a in a not show Mr

have grave concerns over this
issue as I've said before on the
floor I feel like we are greatly
hope this task force or
commission will look at the I
know they will look deeply into
those issues but it that's a
hard thing to study hard in the
study how much how much does
that that's our our biggest

there because we are moving on
to the next order of business or
the next item will have Senate
amended with the mercy Clause I
have been taken and it is now
subject to the right amendment
or substitution no objection
Senator Ivey Soto explained the
included some of that were some
security enhancements that we
did to the voting process
particularly for those voting by
mail of the all of those
normal course of business and
incorporate the parts that
worked in and drop the ones that
didn't of course nobody
anticipated that we might have
to do a and all an out of cycle
separate issue this is this is
about the voting process for the
voters
and it is similar to what we did
with regard to Senate bill of
had a legislative electoral
health and safety task force
that was created that is that is
not created at this point I
think we feel pretty pretty
confident about how to run an
send absentee ballot
applications automatically to
voters that is not in this bill
of there will be an notice sent
to voters letting voters know
that process and then we also
thanks to some
cogent input from Senator Moores
be a deputy sheriff or state
police officer of that is
present to secure the ballots
until the election board comes
back in the next day and if not
properly secured out which I
really appreciate the input that
was provided on that and so that
was president happy to stand for
questions Senator Ivey Soto we
do have debate senator Morris
thank you Mr president thank you
To the election to everything
that's happened since then I
think was very important work on
this piece of legislation a
bipartisan manner I think it
did.
Get improved and the committee
process was cogent all my
noted however I think the
Senator is one of the shortest
bills is ever introduced I want
to thank you for that also of a
mostly just in the state age I
think it's a report on the
selection bills the to to work
Thank you Mr president the
sponsor yield and I said the
deal was presently have to thank
you Mr president center I
Thank you very much I miss
president at center Brandt so
this is specific.
To any
and and if you look at the very
only election would apply to is
is an election to fill a vacancy
for United States representative
it anything else that would
affect any other election again
should be done in the normal
Thank you Mr president just
thought it was important to
clarify that to make sure
because we actually do have some
other elections this year their
school boards there's.
the only applied to this special
circumstance that we may or may
not.

Thank you Mr president I ask
unanimous consent of the Senate
that the record show all action
amendment or substitution and Mr
president we do have a floor
amendment.
Thank you senator I want to go
and explain what the bill does
and then we'll go into the floor
amendment was getting passed out
clear that of certain.
Words and symbols associated
with pharmacy have now passed
we started with the R. X.
symbol.
And then in Judiciary was it was
amended to add the apothecary
the word apothecary or
apothecary shop.
For now the with the judiciary
amendment apothecary that word
to describe something other than
a pharmacy.
And the floor amendment it Mr
get that in and then we'll have
you explain what that does.
The to read Senate floor
amendment number one to Senate
Senate floor amendment number
one to Senate bill one twenty
two this this is a catch by the
Legislative Council Service when
the Judiciary Committee.
making the title fully describe
the contents of the bill.
Thank you senator Senator
debating senator member number
one.
Anyone wishing to bank.
debate on the amendment Senator
participate in the clothes on
the amendment good.
Mr president I would move the
the adoption of Senate Senate
See no objection the amendment
has been adopted we're back on
the bill.
Senator Moores.
you finish presenting this.
And so I above the question
wanted us at that time that did
not come up was
why are we doing this Mr
You know for us is a I'm looking
at this we have a apothecary up
from there in the old agency
Mister president senator Morris
actually I I don't think it was
that particular business the
that had problems but one of my
She was she had started a coffee
shop adjacent to pharmacy.
And the coffee shop was called
remedy then she the are in
remedy she use the R. X. symbol.
disciplinary action but she met
with the pharmacy board used to
be the chairman of the pharmacy
board actually that she met with
the current pharmacy board and
they said you know the the law
is the law you need to if if
than was because Mr president
senator the she was a pharmacist
the pharmacists pharmacy board
did not have any authority on
there are the spas the use are
acts of there are health the the
use the R. X. and and and
because of pharmacy board
doesn't have any control over
them I think that's the issue.
The agency president I was gonna
be my question so because I do
Thank you Mr president senator
Morris the point is that that
certain terms like apothecary or
that are ex symbol have become
so widely used apart from
up my next point because you
have in this list come a shop
drug store drugs drug we are not
drug test on the road that is
druggie.
And I think those are those of
patent medicines and and the
cosmetics and things like that

man as twice amended has passed
the Senate senator Morris
explains vote then I'll go to
center to spin a center more
status president Senator Ingle
of the chamber but he explained
to me as he was walking out what
would love to hear it thank you
very much Mr president and
members of the Senate.
Thank you senator centers were
moving on to the next bill which
is Senate bill ninety four as
amended senator Morris.
Our final passage be taking that
is also to debate amendment or
substitution the no objection
Senator Moores to explain the
bill.
bill any bill or to bring those
two organizations together is
powerful I know you're a big fan
of this bill to Mister president
the NCAA rules conference rules
for friends prevent athletes
from actually profiting off
their name image and likeness in
during our process what this
use that you go to the Olympics
represents your country in the
Olympics and you have to give up
your arm eligibility to be able
to profit on any adore Spence
California started this ball
rolling two years ago the past
this legislation as we all know
California's about one fifth of
the country's our economic base
conference opponents that we
play are either in Colorado or
in California and in New Mexico
state all of their conference
chart opponents are in
really see this as a competitive
advantage or disadvantage if we
don't pass it on to be able to
recruit athletes to the wrist
mispronounce of state and other
Comment after I blocked for him
we can run the ball to the
finish line etcetera etcetera
more just for clarification do
you have an expert witness on
this bill.
Mr president no I do not my
expert witnesses Center o'neill
thank you senator Neville.
have been all American body but
anyway so yes this I think I've
been really impressed with all
the work the Senator my
colleague from the northeast
heights is done on this is got
amendments that we adopted and
and but I think it was a
unanimous to pass out of
judiciary so with that I see I
stand in strong support of this
with center of.
Moores you'll please Senator
Moores deal to this president
happy to thanks very much is
present agency president I'm I'm
looking at a page to line I.
of the previous bill and could
yield Senator Ingle the field.
Certainly.
This presents Ingle as you're
out of the the room here to
I'll leave it at that Mr
president.
Thanks pry on do that on a
private basis with Senator too
she Pino.
Mr president I yield to the good
doctor from the sounds.
Thank you Mr president and
Center.
the details but echo what is
would help us out a little bit.
But I do have a few questions
what about non athletes are
there are I just wanna make sure
getting education so is there a
compare of all
you know allegory or or anything
that would be compatible on the
non athletes side where we're a
this bill is that most athletes
you know the all the attention
goes are usually from the press
and and the money usually goes
and talks about fall college
football players and men women's
the ones who are on scholarship
or on partial scholarships yet
the NCAA and rules prevent them
from actually making a living
because are considered student
help calm all sorts athletes and
other student athletes all the
students at universities are
able to continue to work you can
go get a job you can work
with all fortunate to be on
scholarship Mr president but
most athletes are not on
scholarship and yet are
recruitment because you know
this this is been an issue with
do you know and and a lot of
universities have been slapped
on the wrist sometimes or
discipline because there was a
as student athlete has already a
sponsorship coming in has signed
a deal with a marketing company
or something like that how how
would that affect recruitment
thank you Mr president you the
bill last year have addressed
the incentives of improvements
so now this bill actually
prevents universities from using
those potential endorsements as
cannot promise someone come in
and door Smith deal if they came
in and I played basketball at a
certain University.
Thank you Mr president.
Thank you senator Senator
Pirtle.
And thank you Mr president and
senator with this apply to the
national champion rugby team
from Las Vegas at the New Mexico
should yield to Senator Campos
is that a club team if it's a
club team it would not if it's
actually a passionate our
conference or under NCAA rules
there their championship team
they've been.
really strong over all these
years thank you Mr president.
So Mister president Senator
Pirtle would not apply to them
since they are not are prevented
having jobs into New Orleans as
it is official support team.
And thank you Mr president thank
you Senator for that answer I I
was assuming that but I wanted
to get that clarification
athletes that come in and we
have this on the books that they
might be able to get you know an
endorsement deal here there and
and help pay for their college
maybe in the past would have
been able to.
Mr president Senator parole
absolutely that was the point if
we do not pass this would be at
a competitive disadvantage if we
the first state and to to in
California and Colorado which is
also pass this our rival
cruising grounds for us from the
effort director New Mexico state
his conference Mr president
so they have to they have to
compete against that recruitment
effort out of California and
other student athletes as I can
go to the school in California
And thank you for that Mr
president and senator I I think
you know this is a great idea
it's long overdue
one of the things I dislike most
them are able to go on and make
tons of money professionally not
everybody is a lebron James or
Tom Brady so I think this is a
way that we can help them get
collegiate career so I stand
support thank you Mr president.
Thank you senator any further
debate Senators.
Senator yield personal questions
Senator Moores detailed.
Mr president not if I have to
say anything good about the
Aggies.
I think a potential impact
actually on on our Agpiece and
and other smaller schools so I I
have a few questions about the
likeness and and just build
making come period
Often better yes if they are.
You know generating money off
their likeness but having said
president senator Byrd that's
the that is actually the point
of the legislation is after
California passed this bill I
mentioned in my opening then
Mr president as bureaucratic
organization of drug their feet
and since then California's pass
I meant to call for help
Colorado has passed orders
NCAA's going to have to relax
with all these other states
doing as and joining.
Hopefully New Mexico Colorado
Arizona Florida and all the
other states are doing this so
NCAA right now are are they.
Are there any repercussions our
schools are paying their student
athletes from participating in
NCAA.
eligibility per NCAA rules if we
did not pass the so that's the
case I mentioned earlier about
Olympian athletes some very
compelling testimony from a
endorsements she had to to to do
the endorsements where she made
money on actually profited from
that hard working years of
service and come Representative
some revenue off of that she
meant she had to give up her
eligibility and not be able to
play anymore Stanford.
All right but I guess on and so
Presumably New Mexico in the
future if we were to pass just
where we allow students to be
paid but the NCAA rules say you
The NCAA tournament.
Mister president senator that is
the point of having so many
states including a monster of
Jersey Nebraska New Mexico
Colorado in the NCAA any longer
so the NCAA would have to make
that decision do not want to be
in the states
answer the question though about
like what is their current
sanction policy for how they
treat states teams or athletes
Residents are for the clear the
current rule would be that just
like I use the example of a the
only be an athlete she lot
But once I put the interests of
the student athlete.
First quite frankly but I
another question this presents
center on the revenue sharing.
Mr president at this time no
this would allow the student
athletes to monetize their own
image and likeness and name on
those universities implant are
participate in athletics
with and be able to monetize
their name image likeness such
as social media post
Right I guess I guess what I'm
wondering is does Mr president
served as the bill prohibit
school from or prohibit legal
action from a student athlete
now you need to pay up does it
does actually prevent schools
from being liable to have to pay
up.
This presents this bill does not
is in the appeals level at this
point action Mr president I
think it's already schedule from
spring court.
Yeah Syria raising
president so I I think it leads
to then another question which
is that if the school is
generating money off of an
athlete and they have their own
Mr president senator that was
the point of the amendment that
would prevent universities from
using that as an inducement for
signing athletes.
Well that's good I think that's
a good thing but all right well
then finally I just my my
observation is is.
visibility make more money and
to the disadvantage maybe a
smaller programs and that for
what it's worth could
disadvantage smaller schools in
New Mexico but.
But this would mean monetary
success to so are you concerned
at all about creating
disparities Justin talent
recruitment.
When you put this in writing and
MSU athletic director his
competition hit and miss present
off your question Senator I
can't remember the name of the
conference the Aggies are and
another independent in football
so I can't remember the other
Arial said that the the ten I
think ten of his opponents in
that conference are based in the
state of California so he would
questions Senator thank you Mr
president so I have Senator
Steinborn Senator Lopez I'm Mr
president unanimous consent to
excuse senator Manny also until
Candelaria Senator Pinto thank

unanimous consent of the Senate
for the.
substitution hearing no
objection senator Claire
Hemphill to explain the bill
thank you Mr president and
members on this bill provides
enrollment preference for
this is and rules are and this
is and enrollment preference
that is already provided in
traditional public schools and
I've worked in both traditional
public schools and charter
same school that I'm working and
it's made life so much easier
for not just me my husband and
my family but also for the
children and the families that I
oxygen mask on first before
attending to children or to
others and this applies in real
life too if we don't have our
also that the mental state of
the dolt is what dictates the
mental state for the brain state
of the child and so if the doll
going to feel calm they're going
to feel valued and respected.
And when we're under stress
whether a teacher or a student
to have happen in the schools so
providing enrollment preferences
for students whose parents are
employees of charter schools
will reduce the stress on the
employee their children their
stronger relationships with in
the school.
environment and this is another
developmental need that we need
we all seek out connection in
way till till you die we need to
have those connections and so
when we're able to recruit
school staff and they're able to
stay in the school on the whole
screen has a healthier
And so by a real taking efforts
to reduce their stress the whole
community benefits thank you Mr
president and I stand for
questions thank you senator we
I yield thank you Mr president
senator and and you know reading
through the bill and your
explanation was really really
gonna put a requirement that the
employee work a certain number
of hours because what I would be
afraid of is somebody becoming
an employee
as did that question come up Mr
president and senator in
committee.
Mr president Senator I I I
somebody could be employed I I
originally worked for the
traditional public schools the
school psychologist I spent many
years in the traditional public
school
four and I was
you know let go from the public
school when I had to take unpaid
to over seventy that I was
getting in the traditional
public school so it was a
minimum amount of time they did
not have an opening for my son
at that point he stayed in the
to be successful so I I hope
that addresses your question Mr
president and senator I think
that all employees are deserving
regardless of how much time
there they spend.
absolutely supportive of of the
concept but I still think that
there might be Mister president
senator
circumvent the the lottery
system that's put in place so I
I'm going to support it but I I
think that might be a concern
moving forward that we might see
in the future thank you Mr
president.
yield Mister president I yield
thank you Mr president senator I
just struggled with this bill in
committee and and I go to
support it but I am still
struggling.
I get that but there's a huge
difference between traditional
public school and the charter
school and that is a very
limited number of spots in a
charter school.
residents charter school they
don't and so there is a very
competitive.
Process of having this lottery
The ten percent chance of being
able to win the lottery and have
your student go are your your
child go to that school so can
Thank you Mr president and
senator for the question
I guess how I would answer that
was and so she was under a lot
of stress trying to drop off for
kids in the morning at the other
screen and then picking them up
in the afternoon and if they got
sick that was very stressful for
children and manage the the role
as a social worker and so she
left it education completely and
they were not able to find
supports so I I hear what you're
saying that there are thirty
five schools.
Thirty five charter schools in
New Mexico who currently have
Positions if you will but the
number is very minimal so I
think that there are there
aren't a lot of children that
are going to be negatively
impacted and I think that the
Mr president the senator thank
you for that explanation I think
gives us a little bit more food
for thought
advantage to a.
a staff member's child.
That maybe isn't given to the
rest of community some of these
communities some of the schools
are put together for high risk
students some of the schools are
put together for low income
I'm struggling with with this
bill it's what I struggled with
in committee with this bill
you know as you said it's a
of that child are going to help
reference down the road so
there's ways that this can be
manipulated there's ways that
this can be abused in the future
Thank you Mr president I don't
need the sponsor to yield I just
stand in strong support of this
bill.
To have their children go to
that school just think about all
the issues day care.
have their students there in the
school that certainly at I
haven't taught in about ten
years I availed myself of this
say that if if this is what we
alone the public schools are
charter schools are public
schools also so it's a fairness
issue I can't think of almost
all day so I don't think the
issues raised.
Will affect this and I urged the
body to support the bill thank
Senator Pirtle moving explain
amendment.
Move Senate floor amendment
number one to Senate bill fifty
one we have a motion go ahead
senator explained the explain
week or one hundred thirty hours
a month.
Senator Hemphill career Hemphill
that funding is so minimal in
our schools that there are such
a small number of hires and only
where they're really needed and
several employees including
school teachers and employees
and be able to find their
children that order if it's
available thank you Mr
president.
You centers we are debating
Senator Moores the Suazo present
just seems like a common sense
amendment if you.
Purpose present have my mask on
or two a week or a month for
that matter be considered
employee and to game that system
really easily so this is a safe
care card for all those how
parents waiting to get in a
Thank you Mr president so I I
rise in opposition in part
because again the fairness issue
we're not saying this to the
isn't an issue of gaming the
system this is an issue of
fairness and equity among all of
our public schools thank you.
Thank you senator any further
Thank you Mr president members
of the body I I think this
ammendment definitely makes the
bill better it ensures that the
original intent of the bill is
waiting for the for the lottery
spots and and if the issue is
dropping off and picking up well
if you're working full time
you know you're going to be
the intent and make sure that we
don't see people gaming the
system in the future and with
that I move Senate floor
amendment number one to Senate
bill fifty one and I ask for a

fairness and I stand in strong

had the wonderful honor of
serving on the board of the
governing council for the J.
Paul Taylor academy a charter
to provide quality education to
the two hundred students that so
that a ten J. Paul Taylor
academy I also had the wonderful
honor of of knowing several of
the exceptional teachers Mister
and we also have another of
charter school in Los crucis
called racist off of it which
brings and indigenous values to
educating our young people thank
one of the things that I've
about the lottery system but I
also look at this is an
opportunity for employee retain
ability and if we have teachers
who are able to have their kids
there while they're they're
values community service that I
feel that this is an incredibly
bill and I'm glad that the the
sponsor brought this forward and
so I do stand in support and
look forward to voting yes in
keep the building staff on their
toes who still can't tell the
difference between me and
Senator Hemphill looting that
building security but mostly as
one working mother to another
the best interest of her
children if those children cross
with the same a charter school
so thank you for bringing four

the department of health but she
is on a leave of absence where
she has also served as chair
professor preventative mental
and public health.
Mr president members of the
Senate she also served is a
wonderful long
and shows that her true
commitment is with regards to
the issue of public health which
Mr president members of the
rules committee this morning Mr
Chairman was I think at length
we did spend this morning
talking about issues with create
pleaded to the pandemic of
you know that the knowledge base
of it she has especially we
talking about equity of how we

community especially as the
on the confirmation we have
Senator Pirtle followed by
Senator Brandt and senator
Morris Senator Pirtle thank you
Mr president I rise in support
Secretary of health I do wish
that she had been the the
secretary of for a period of
time before coming over in
December.
But I just want to tell you we
addressed all the issues that
that our consent that.
The concerns of my district
moving forward and she's made a
the COVID virus but also finding
that balance on the health
whether it's mental health or
other physical health that has
she'll definitely do that she's
here to listen to us take take
our input and so for that reason
I stand in support of the
yield but I have some concerns
on this nominee.
And I'm probably gonna go now.
The fact of the matter is three
weeks ago.
helped them get back to work in
your schools opened.
Send a letter to the.
secretary designate.
I have yet to get a response.
About the.
Of the fact that Sandoval County
barely had five percent.
Transparency in that system.
To just and asked why Sandoval
County seem to be being ignored
when it came to the vaccine.
And she claims never got the
letters.
And then claimed that well she
hadn't been in the office to get
the letters.
a correspondence sent by a
legislator.
was deemed at least by her
staff.
As not being important enough to
I'm simply asking we have some
transparency when it comes to
the vaccine roll out.
And why it seems that the county
that I Representative.
Who are signed up to get that
vaccine that that vaccine clinic
was canceled.
I've gotten no response still.
Theirs was also abruptly
canceled.
At the same time Los crucis as
was allowed to go on Santa fe's
there turning at.
Well.
Was it the turn based on what
district you are part of.
response is good policy and good
way to run the department thank
you a Senator Brandt further
debate senator Morris.
You Mr president the rise and
commitment the need for better
communication special with the
legislature as we move forward
but those are very legitimate
concerns that Senator Brandt
Mrs or doctor Collins was by far
by farmers to present the most
qualified secretary health New
Mexicans are going to have
incredibly impressive resume and
laudable to say the least
she's given up a opportunity to
to make their living and move
forward and economic relations
Very impressive very impressive
articulate some secretary again
I think she probably the best
we've ever had and so was
president or stand in support of
the nomination.
Was a chance to go through the
different aspects of the
emergency order and I thought
the questioning was was thorough
Secretary Collins doctor Collins
went out of her way to meet with
all of us and really spend time
with each of us talking about
her vision talking about who she
think it it's a indication to me
that there was a respect for us
on the rules committee in the
process so I'm not sure quite
what happened and I and again I
think.
think that's important but I
just don't want to take that
have that anyway take away from
the incredible person who is
before us today because I really
willing to step up to what's
gonna be the toughest cabinet
spot there is so I just want to
rise and support and really
encourage the members to support
UNM because I often know them I
don't know Dr Tracy Collins
personally but in reviewing the
record at UNM I just so
the course is she teach the the
two main courses she teaches or
taught principles of
epidemiology and evidence based
medicine are so important for
think this this the nominee is
is fantastic and I commend the
governor for such an important
an excellent nomination thank
want to stand in support.
And.
We are so lucky to have such a
unique individual in the state.
The division of population
health.
And for all of us here that may
be a new term.
People fifty and older how do we
look at the statistics.
And the data to be sure that we
are spending our money in the
America and is getting to New
Mexico I first learned about it
when I was CEO at levels health
systems and also when I started
What an impressive individual
she is going to be able to do so
much for this state not just run
a bureaucratic Department also
bring the future twenty first
difficult task thank you for
hearing me out on this but this
is an exceptional appointee.
Thank you senator.
Dr Collins in the Albuquerque
journal this morning there was
a.
An article it didn't seem to
make sense when I first read it
And it said our our
administration was a hundred I
think a hundred and two point
three percent of the doses that
we had received and then they
explained this morning that what
and the the expectation is that
five of those will be
administered we've administered
so many of those complete six.
That are are actually our rate
has been available has been
administered so I know there are
a lot of people who say what am
I going to get money what the
teachers want to have there's.
I have constituents the state
not enough vaccine yet so
they're doing the best they can
I think it's incredible when you
read the other states how how
hello there percentage of the
vaccine that they received is
position so I would I would
hardly endorser confirmation
today.

Executive Indo any further

and we're gonna try to get
through these agencies we're
hearing that house bill two may
come over next week and so will
be begin to work on the budget
I want to thank every member of
agencies got a lot of money and
members of the Senate got a say
in the budget and got to get
some funding for what they
thought were their priorities so
I think that's very good I think
the language in the junior bill
in the junior bill bill probably
hear something on Monday once
that bills put together will
bring it back down to the floor
and and and get it over and
trouble because we did what we
did first and where the Senate
more the more deliver body and
it worked really good process
for us for the first time and I
think it's going to be a great
number yep no once we do we'll
get that to the members there's
gonna be a lot in negotiation
going on and so is that moves
across I want members to think
of all the federal money that
they're gonna want your money
first and when they receive the
federal money they're going to
do what they want with it so
when those cities and counties
in and agencies come to you ask
they got sixteen million dollars
from the fed from the federal
money from DFA.
And they replace that all within
their budget so they had a
sixteen million dollar surplus
and and so will help you along
with that process we need
so I appreciate your time and
and Senate finance will not meet
today and will start we may meet
