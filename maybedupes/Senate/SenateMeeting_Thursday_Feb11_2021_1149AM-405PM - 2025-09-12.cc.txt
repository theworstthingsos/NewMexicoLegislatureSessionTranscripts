Any further debate on this

Thank you madam president
the prior comments for physician
to refer.
Is to become complicit and to
engage in a professional

Based on the standards of
practice and ethics widely
accepted ethics in medicine that
referring doctor is complicit in
that act.
that I in my opinion that last
comment was.
The.
The heart of this debate.
that is really the heart of of
this debate it's not about are
their redundancies in the law
and we can argue over that day
and night.
thank you I'm not going to
participate in abortion as well
as no thank you I would not like
to refer for an abortion.
Common respect for health care
provider not to become morally
complicit in abortion and yes we
must refer or you must do this
and I think that's where the
tension is in this amendment the
tension is what I'm hearing from
that last very insightful even

some people see that as a
barrier to health care access in
some people see it as a as a

And so with respect madam chair
I I do withdraw the point of
so well here today so we're back
on debate of the amendment who
would like to be for.
Madam chair just understand what
we're doing point so the motions
All right so any debate on the
amendment.
So.
that were brought up so
specifically in the conscience

the word justified justified
medical termination was still

think that that they've left
except to preserve the life of a
woman so we've been told.
There are hillbilly doctors
outside Albuquerque Hey.
A little.
But we would put it in the law
in the bill here just make sure.
Just to make sure.
And then the refusal of a health
care provider to participate in
addressed all the points that
were made by Senator Wirth and
others on the floor here.
I think this is a great
compromise bill.
It protects women.
Using accepted medical practice
that still stays in there why
would we want to take that all
why would we want to save it an
abortionist can can do anything
here she wants.
would say no you can't do that
that's not an acceptable medical
practice I think senator Davis
set the right tone here.
It leaves in things that protect
women.
this should be objective bull
objectionable.
Based on the arguments that
we've already heard on the
Senate floor.
I think you've got it figured
out.
We're on the debate of the

it's very clear that all of us
in here are committed to

the language will be very clear

boyfriends mothers make a
decision for a woman who walked
in to have the abortion the
think it's great compromise on
both sides this is my first time
to speak on the Senate floor and
I want to tell you is the newly
elected conservative.
as an example of compromise in
introducing a bill that would
allow for abortion in New Mexico
and I will have constituents
that I have to address that with
but I do believe this is the
I stand for any questions and I
thank you for allowing me to
introduce and madam president.
Debate on the floor substitute
first I have Senator Candelaria.
you know the the issue is this
madam president again this for
substance present a big lie.
The big lie is that New Mexico
healthy baby but one day before
they give birth they just
decided in what this is gonna be
inconvenient for me so I'm gonna
go kill My Baby.
Miss madam president that
doesn't happen.
Abortions occur after twenty
weeks occur when a child is
dead.
Portion after twenty weeks.
Are incredibly complicated
medical situations and I I
Have you ever had a baby who is
healthy who is going to be
aborted the day before it is
born and the answer was
absolutely not it doesn't
happen.
away.
Right in the trash.
Right in the trash why the
And just because you believe
that morally because religion
says so doesn't mean the rest of
us have to.
Our democracy.
Madam president the other issue
was this implication made madam
president that a doctor should
have the rights.
To not make a referral to a
woman not inform her of all her
districts very broad work that
include this exception for
doctors to not make a referral
for informal one of her options
And render Care to their patient
or in the alternative make a
referral for that patient then
they are in violation of their
oath and they should resign
their medical license.
objection and then to die to
make a referral fly.
Because doctors take an oath not
to themselves but to their
patients.
And to their patients well
being.
again is prefaced on a big lie
and I'll tell whatever right to
life committee wants to send me
a propagandist understand it
goes right in the trash thank
you.
I actually don't stand to debate
the bill because the sponsor is
actually forty seventh correct
she's trying to introduce a bill
message for introducing a bill I
will remind the freshman senator
is to introduce the bill through
the normal process and then take
Next we have Senator smitteez.
Thank you
Madam president I will ask the
that not all physicians take the
Geneva convention oath that is
an ever changing.
Multiplay.
medical ethics will continue.
To change at the whims of
society.
However the Hippocratic oath.
The original Hippocratic oath.

civilization would you agree
with the original have a crack
or not.
Consensus is that that's when
western civilization started.
medical ethics is to respect the
autonomy of the health care
provider to respect the autonomy
of the physician.
just want to clarify those
things on on medical ethics.
and then miss madam president
with the sponsor the US
Committee.
What would you say that if this
for substance was adopted that
it would ensure a safer.
Environment for women in New
Mexico.
madam president and senator I I
I would like to ask the sponsor
the bill to yield that I've I've
already heard the the answer I
so what I'll just say.
Is I'd like to just read a quote
from the American college and of
obstetricians and gynecologists
And so if we're gonna talk about
standards of care from a
professional organization that

repeat they are not it hearing
to the standards of practice.
Set forth by the American

According to a standard of care.
Or at least the so called
professional societies actually
say about late term abortion.
and then finally this is very
disturbing.
And
There was a statement made that
this just doesn't happen the
people don't just say I want to
abort my My Baby.
Well it does.

substitute.
Thank you madam president.
For most of my life I've heard
that abortion should be safe.
She's not put any constraints
really except after twenty
weeks.
She certainly made it safe.
It's certainly legal under her
bill.
And yet I continue to hear
arguments that it's not right.
We've been.
And we also know that the scare
tactics that were perpetuated to
ads on television and radio and
mailers didn't come from this
side.
Senator Diamond has solved that.
Scares not coming from scare
tactics are coming from us.
But our doctors are worried.
This this leaves all the
protection for women in place.
In fact it strengthens the
protection for women.
Doesn't make it worse.
Thanks.
I don't challenge any of those
stories.
But this bill addresses those
stories as well.
Good medical care.
How do we help people do the
right thing in their mind
safely.
I think Senator Diamond has
achieved that.
Absolutely.
By protecting our doctors and
protecting our women.
You can feel love at twenty

Senator Diamond.

It makes me sad.
It makes me sad that even if we

We're still.
I am available for debate.
information that's being
represented on this floor.
Earlier we heard Senator get up
and say they are a member of the
board of the American academy of
the ethics.
that the moral conscience of the
provider should be placed above
all other things the woman
doesn't matter.
So I get up miss madam president
to share with his body other
evidence the opposing side is
trying to present.
Regarding homosexuality.
The American academy of ethics
again member of our Senate is on
that board.
never consider telling their
patients who struggle with
alcoholism or obesity in spite
of the fact that there may be a
genetic predisposition to these
treatment to allow them to avoid
the on healthy consequences of
those conditions and here's
where it gets really good from
or worse than alcoholism when in
fact treatment of homosexuality
has a cure rate at least as good
if not better than alcoholism.
That like in my husband and I to
alcoholics.
That is the type of moral
Next trans gender identity.
The American academy of ethics
again the ethical body that the
opposing side wants us to join
Can we just keep it down in here
Senator Candelaria has the
following.

the senator doesn't like other

So I raise these points madam

This is the authority.

endorse.
Point of order madam chair he
should be directing the all
comments to the chair so madam
president I just a Senator if
you agree with the moral
than alcoholics that we have a

president Senator Candelaria you
first have to acetone to yield.
I ask the question we're not
going to get an answer I think I
know the answer it is
interesting the culture and
politics of grievance for people
not yielding the floor.
take a big breath and go through
the chair I think we're doing a
good job it's been a good debate
interesting ideas let's just
know medical ethics is being
brought up a lot in this
discussion which is quite
appropriate.
and so let's let's look at the
medical ethics around the world.
And what what do they believe
what have they done.
From a policy standpoint let's
look at Europe.
and by the way in this committee
That we're gonna just draw a
line in the sand somewhere let's
let's stop doing late term
abortions let's just draw the
line in the sand at thirty five
weeks well let's look at Europe
because our country naturally
most of the nation's have landed
somewhere as the US golfer this
call bit of a compromise you
know we have some people left
that one bills like this with no
Okay if you just go around these
these different countries you
cannot get a elective abortion
after twelve or sometimes
fourteen weeks.
Those are the most common
asking for twelve it's asking
for thirty five the other some
of the other countries that do
allow we're talking about here
this this radical nature of late
term abortion North Korea and
China.
in support of of this this bill
mainly just from the standpoint
of late term abortion and I'll
just end with the the quote for
those the people that seem to be

With the issue of us.

Take should out and says.
Abortions can occur up until
thirty five weeks.
For the little guy.
Right now this body is on
willing to do that.
We can come together on
something like this maybe we
just can't.
And I really feel like that's a
that's a failing that we we
have.
Then what can we actually do.
You know I've shared in.
I've sent in committee hearings
Senator sure Representative for

That pretty much addresses all
years ago on the floor.
Right about the same time we
were debating that there was.
An outcry in the state of New

That's why.
I thank senator sure has put

I want you know I want to

going to happen so just a little
of lightness here yeah I know
this is a very serious very.
keep it the collegial that we
keep our tone.
from getting too excited and I
understand some of us are more
passionate than others I get
that.
I have been told that I'm a man
and I should sit down and shut
up on this issue.
Well.
I have a lot of women vote for
To represent those in my
district.
I have never apologize I've
never even.
No one voted for the other guy.
Where there wasn't another guy
sorry.
Madam president I respectfully
declined to comment.
Senator Ingle would you go for
question.
Yes.
Would you say more than thirty.
A bit.
President center of you ever.
I I think I have remembered that
maybe a couple of times of but
no more than that as a as I
recall and
to the same questions I think
we're ask over and over and over
and over again in person just
said Mister president or madam
president I've entered that
question.
And we're being told by the
sponsor of the bill that they
will not yield to questions on
their bill.
I for that reason alone this
bill should be thrown out.
I think this is everything we
need to say.
Since meetings.
Thank you madam president.
And I had mentioned to them
that.
There's a certain political
ideology that is.
Either number one on willing to
Three very brief stories
The last of which was a call I
received from a constituent
asking you to support this bill.
Full professor.
Who is that one of the highest.
Cancer centers in America.
This is not a man I'd ever seen
cry.
And he shared with us we're
His number one regret.
And that was with a young fairly
newly wed woman.
And this service team surgeon
advised her to get an abortion.
Because of the ensuing.
Based on medical information.
And the reason telling the
stories mainly for the benefit
of of I think each other I'm not
thinking that this story is
going to change anyone's vote.
be a positive and I'm I have
lots of stories to tell but this
is a story that I think would
result in at least a better
understanding of where pro life
person is coming from.
she came back and had her
thyroid removed.
Except the problem.
Was that when the thyroid.

This decision that this
professor was part of that he
made a decision based on
available the best available
want to share that complicated
story and I'm advocating this
legislature to air on the side
of life for going to air like to
just to add that to the mix and
our understanding of these
complicated times.
A quick one was Tim Tebow he was
told his mother was told the
A story that I've heard actually
multiple times when I was in the
house.
When I've listened to women in
received tons of emails and
phone calls and I took a phone
call from I was at my house just
a couple weeks ago.
And it was a constituent
New Mexico women from Planned
Parenthood I asked for to tell
me.
why she would like to.
so I want to take a minute or
two to share it with this body.
She said that she had a very
rough.
Family situation.
Forster pressured her to get an
abortion and then deserted her
after she said that he left I I
actually interrupted her on the
phone and I said he was a
coward.
He was just young and immature.
Do you see the problem.
Defense.
Are we empowering here.
And that is the stories that I
am hearing we must I don't want
to hear any more stories of
women who are making excuses or
for creating conditions that
are.
Pressuring those women.
And shame on us for not
recognizing.
That abortion is just
facilitating that.
As a husband of sixteen years
to a beautiful and I'm married
to whose birthday is today and a
father of four daughters.
Thank you madam president I
hesitated to speak on this bill.
But as a Catholic who's voted
for this legislation in the
past.
I know there are many Catholics
who disagree with me on it I get
the thousands of emails
expressing their disbelief that
I can be a Catholic and still
nineteen sixty one in the
seminary I was studying to be a
teaching brothers and religious
order.
We took theology every single
one of those years it was
constant.
Nothing was ever mentioned about
abortion.
This is pre roe V. Wade this was
in an aeroplane the church I
think assumed.
Was the primacy of the
individual's conscience.
That each person before god just
to make their own decisions
and their belief in their own
heart of hearts are in
disagreement.
They really need.
And it and it can be just a
It would be wrong for them to
violate their own conscience.
Then I became a social worker.
a law against it abortion still
happened.
Just because it was illegal it
didn't go away.
Senator the waiver remove
tomorrow.
An underground.
Where women in desperate
straits.
Would have unsafe.
And medically dangerous
procedures done.
Then the second thing I wanted
to share is in nineteen sixty

he was a Catholic.
that he felt as a candidate.
He had to go before a special
can convention of the southern
Baptists in Houston.
interact without it being
imposed on other people.
And he did that very eloquently.
And he was elected president and
But it was not a question of
imposition of Catholicism on
anybody else.
I remember that every time we
have this debate.
obviously there are many
countries where Islam is the
official religion and you don't
deviate from it there are other
countries where Catholicism is
the official religion and you
say your views are your views
and money or money and we have
to come together somehow but I
will not force my views on you.
But that vision was put into a
book that was very influential
on me in the early sixties by
And how that can believe over
dangerously into public policy
and force other people to do
religions who have different
views of when human life begins.
It is not an accepted fact that
it begins at the moment of
conception.
And the church itself is very
input input it interpreted as
the beginning of human life.
So the final point I wanted to
make is.
I I just was reminded over and
over again.
How desperate it is for children
to be brought up in households
where they were not wanted.
We didn't have supports for
women in a situation like that
we're because they were
hopelessly unprepared to be a
for every woman who who it feels
unprepared to be a parent.
But I don't think our laws
should say you don't have that
option at all.
individual conscience of that
woman.
And her family and for whatever
support she has and her health
care provider thank you madam
president.
Just I have to reboot one thing
here from from senator Ortiz
Pedro I I I know that he went to
Yes I agree if you have a well
formed conscience following.
But they also use will form this
meeting you understand all of
First of all in nineteen sixty
nine we legalized abortion would
make it illegal it was already
illegal we legalized.
In New Mexico.
But there were certain cav
yachts in there.

accredited hospital a woman must

required to.
And it made it a crime.
To perform an abortion if it
wasn't justified.

degree the other way around
We actually agree that some of
those things don't belong to the
special board belong in there.
We're willing to take out all in

None of the things that we talk
about women getting abortions
about happening in New Mexico
