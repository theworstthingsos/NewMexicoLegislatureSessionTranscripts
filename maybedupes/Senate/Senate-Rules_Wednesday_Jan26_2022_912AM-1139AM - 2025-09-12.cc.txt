Good morning ladies and

for joining us rules committee
today we up point of the
property is the this morning and
took us like right we're going
to resume the meeting the
chair and Senator Ivey Soto
we'll be presenting Senate bill
six election security and
administration of the co chair
of the leading the meeting.
Senator Ivey Soto when you're
ready to begin.
We're ready to listen to Senate
bill six.
Thank you very much Senator of a
meal who will be referred to as
the.
As Mr chair during this hearing
and we normally is the vice
chair of this committee.
You're right.
Although it may feel like the co
chair.
okay very good so.
Senator six is
Election security ministration
bill you Mr chairman if I could
just make a suggestion there
are.
There are few amendments I think
more of a of an administrative
nature that I know there'll be
one other moment after that if I
can suggest that we do the
administrative ones during the
presentation before we go to
public comment
and then and then we can go to
public comment and then after
that we can do with any of the
members of people may have to
suggest the
and and then in a nutshell
though since the reader talk
four minutes and thirteen
seconds to read the title
this is introduced on the floor
let me just let me just give
some broad overviews of what
this bill pass
and and I kind of start from the
back of the field the special
district issues and by the way
some people have seen an earlier
version of this which is about
eighty pages longer let me just
indicate that the Ted and Ted
portions of the bill which is
about eighty pages were removed
will run those as a separate
bill
there were some concerns that
were raised particularly
I I I I had several
conversations with.
of Mister John Lipchitz and Anna
and part of Bundy
who who had expressed on behalf
of asked me
that they had some real concerns
about.
teds and PED's and that was a
major area of focus for them and
so
so we're going to let that
discussion where I where I think
that bill provides for really
good governance and
accountability that discussion
take place after for this bill
so that there's it doesn't
distract and detract from this
bill
and so so that's why then those
were broken out so as to not
detract from the rest of this
bill.
The so what this bill does is
first of all for
for mail ballots.
This bill does the following
things first of all it
it prohibits third party
applications for mail ballots to
be sent.
it certainly allows anybody to
promote the the website for
people to request now balance
online and anybody can get the
application from the county
clerk.
it it also provides the time
lines that we've been using the
last couple of elections the
temporary provisions where where
have state ballots are mailed
out by fourteen days before the
election with us to notice to
the voters that they if they
want to drop it back in the mail
they should drop it back to me
at least seven days before the
election and also they can drop
it off at any I'm honored secure
container or polling place of
the kind of clerk's office up
until the day of the election
and so we make sure the voters
aware that information and the
voter can make their own choice
about how they want to proceed.
in this bill we also.
When returning mailed ballots
yet to provide the last four
digits of your social security
number.
as well as part of the security
check when you when you do that
and then we also incorporate the
care process that we've been
using which is proven very
successful so there there's a
problem with the ballot we can
get to the voter on that earlier
rather than later
in New Mexico we let someone
here all the way up through an
appeal but we preferred that
they care before the election.
And so this allows us to do that
hearing before the election
while still maintaining people's
ability to care later on.
We also
then find a a verification
process for the work that
happens within the clerk's
office.
before the absent ballots
election board which owners
watchers can be present to
verify some of that information.
we
do have for election nights.
the language in there that we're
not going to have people work
until they drop at eleven PM
people go home there is
could be somebody what the
uncounted ballots be that law
enforcement or law enforcer is
not available the third for
chief deputy clerk has to get
out of sleeping bag in state
with the ballots allow any
challenger watcher to stay with
them while they watch movies all
night
they we also have a provision
hear them with regard to in
person.
Of voting that whole little
centers all in person collection
a voting locations are working
even centers so that people
within a county can go to any
in person voting location.
and them so those are the those
are the main broader areas.
that we have in the bill we
also.
of one of the other things that
is in the bill is eliminating
the preferment invention.
and and that was I have come up
several times and I had a
conversation with the chair of
the state Democratic Party.
with the first vice chair of the
state Republican Party and with
I believe the chair with
executive director of the state
Libertarian Party all of them
agree that that should go the
comment from the person for the
state Libertarian Party was that
as a libertarian he did not
think the government should be
telling his party how they
should be functions so for him
he found a very consistent that
we should remove.
the
Here is yes.
What you go.
Requests for the for the part of
the bill.
For the part of the bill that
did away with re primary
convention the parts of the bill
the bill that that that get rid
of the prevention or in the bill
so so that would get rid of the
preparing commission.
So but for this bill will get
rid of preparing connection.
And those parties are all in
agreement about it every single
one of them is an agreement very
enthusiastic agreement actually
will but I well I guess we're
getting into a discussion of the
bill but okay I'll come back to
the yeah certainly know about be
happy to unpack some of the.
We we do make sure that we have
we financial with the language
for the state election fund we
also create account election
fund.
we we also make sure that was so
that monies dedicated elections
remain dedicated elections we
also do the
In this in this bill
Just trying to see some of the
main.
Broad strokes.
with regard to special districts
we bring in the pick a citizen
Conservancy districts.
the or Charlie Conservancy
district the mill rebranding
Conservancy district.
into the regular local elections
we make the watershed districts
appointed instead of elected.
they are created by us so a lot
of conservation district.
and so then they're still
responsive to that's all water
conservation district that
created them so with that Mr
chairman I'd like to go over a
couple of.
Of what I think are you mainly
for administrative costs of
clean clean up to this Hey.
And so we'll begin with an
amendment that was given to me
by Senator Moores.
which is a number two two two
two two five point one.
And so.
I and so the the amendment of
the senator Morris has given to
me which is a friendly amendment
your first your first though you
may in your introduction you
using some of our most correct
the the administrator of the
administrative in nature yes.
A.
So so what this one does is.
For for clarifies when we set a
government ID.
When you register to vote same
day make sure that we just
clarified it's a it's a federal
government and state government
we don't we don't limit what
state but a federal government
state government or an Indian
nation tribe of public so those
would be the the ideas that
would be acceptable with your
same day registrants.
We are.
We already have a requirement
for showing an ID when you send
a restaurant says it's just
question providing that
language.
Three that is our number three
and number four.
And number five.
the number of right which item
number five being.
that if you if the address
doesn't match on your ID or
there is no address on the ID
you can then show on a bank
statement a utility bill or
something that had to have the
address we left that had also
have the name of the qualified
elector and I appreciate him
pick it up on that making sure
that it's something that
actually is the name of the
qualified elector along with
their address right like the
bring a bank statement.
And so and then
Numbers six seven and eight.
Yeah nine.
Ten and eleven all of those.
What those are is we.
We've got a process where the
end of the night the election
board at a polling place puts
into an envelope.
The uncounted ballots be they
write ins for hand tallies for
whatever the reasons.
And and so we're just simply
adding in the language that that
has to be sealed.
We are will best we still do
that with a number of seal or a
locking device.
Right so that so that when the
ballots get transmitted we know
that they haven't been opened
the envelope has been open and
close for but the right and so
then and then the others are
just consequential amendments to
sealed.
Virtually sealed with either
number seal for locking device.
And then we were repealing.
Unlawful possession of alcoholic
liquors.
Because we've had in there.
That fund for two hundred dollar
per I mean I mean two hundred
yeah at the two adults have the
no we had in their ay a two
hundred foot limit around
polling place for you could have
any alcohol
that really inhibited people
from being able to vote up in
river county it also have the
impact of
It also have the impact of the
let me do that are hundreds
of some of the vote centers and
early voting locations part and
malls where there may be a
restaurant nearby whatnot right
so just remove that however
there is another part of that so
we're just gonna repeal.
But in center course is pointing
out to me that there's another
part of this about that that
talked about whether not the
election board was able to
consume alcohol while conducting
their business and we agreed
that it would probably would be
a good idea to keep that
prohibition in place so instead
of yield we're doing an
amendment to that section so
most of us here that's my
amendment and.
And then and then finally for
we're getting rid of the
comments from the from the bill
so so they will be in the.
Thank you for that.
With that said of course we have
to stand for questions.
Thank you
Mr Mr chair Senator questions a
moment now why why would the any
use of alcohol by the election
board while they're doing their
duties be prohibited when we
don't do that for the
legislature.
Your bill's get better if
during through accounting
skills.
In the sixty days without.
The Senators before we Madam we
should get comments from the
public those after number going
to comment after these
administrative ones unless you
want to comment on on on this
specifically ma'am go Mr here do
you want to I mean do you want
the members debating the
amendments like I kind of think
it helps to hear from.
You know if there's a public
input you know before we take
action on the amendment.
Certainly you know I guess I
think we I think you to
introduce all the amendments and
then let's do a public comment
and we go back and take a vote
on the amendment one by one but
I think that's I think that that
is that is Senator.
Moores is there's then we also
have been.
On one presenter had a meal
which is two three two two two
two three zero point one.
And Senator how to meals
amendment does two things.
The first is it makes very clear
what I think we've all believed
was in the Sanchez four hundred
years that the board of county
commissioners all preparation
the kind of general fund all
funds necessary for the
ministration elections and such
funds have been deposited in the
county election fund for less
related expenses provided by law
but then after that the
assessors apparently have an
ability to get if they go get
additional training.
To get a slight rate
differential.
And so Senator had a meal then
went and copy those sections and
created some new sections of law
for the county clerk's.
So that in the and the amount of
additional compensation for the
county clerk's is identical to
the amount of
Compensation that is made
available to
to assessors.
And so and so that is simply
being added in here as well Sir
yes okay forget.
And then there is
another one which was from
Senator Stewart and and I will
make the motion as senator
doesn't get here in time which
is to the paper that just a
Senate bill six on it.
In that one for the prohibited
period we were extending the
privative period to all
political committees of the
political parties Senator
Stewart asked that we not invite
lots of litigation that might be
very expensive from.
From not legislative groups and
so what we're doing is then
we're simply restricting it to
keep incumbents candidates.
Campaign committees or
legislative caucus committees
because all of those are are
incumbents and candidates so so
that's where the exclusion
that's that's where the
privative period one of what
life as opposed to the third
party political groups which I
kind of liked but I also
understand her point that would
be inviting some litigation so
so that would be that changed
and then finally I have to that
I would just like to draw
people's attention to.
The first is on page one ninety
six of the bill.
This comes from the municipal
clerks.
One ninety six lines on it one
or there there's not a printer
on this.
Page one ninety six between the
lines eighteen and nineteen the
organizational meeting.
We have fairly old language here
that says that at the first
meeting.
They will appoint.
The people who fill the
appointed offices the
municipality that's appropriate
but then that also suggests that
that there we employing
everybody every two years and
and and and the modern Europe
municipalities have adopted by a
personal code right and their
their employees are not re
employed every two years they're
not all that will subject to
administration coming up so it
would be on page one ninety six
lines eighteen and nineteen
strike for the word and to the
word municipality.
So that way the governing body
what the.
Would vote on the people for the
appointive offices the
municipality but they would not
be voting every time on the
people who are self employed by
the municipality.
Also have that line the line
for the one third.
Florida yes you are your correct
thank you very much line twenty
or employee.
And twenty three for to be
employed.
And then finally the last one is
on page two forty two.
From my Mr didn't miss the look
at this one this came to me from
the municipal courts as at the
request.
And then on page two forty two.
With the appointed watershed
board one of them is to be a
current or former elected
supervisor of the soil the water
conservation district we just
had a type of set of the
watershed district so we should
just on online to page two forty
two line seven strike watershed
and and sort of soil and water
conservation.
And so the idea behind this.
Is.
That water conservation district
that created the watershed
district they would have one of
their supervisors as a board
member on the watershed district
in order to maintain the
communication between.
R. and so that was just a typo
and I appreciate that having
been pointed out to me so Mr
Chairman those those would be
all of the technical amendments
before you go to any.
Any comments from the from the
public there's two primary bill
sponsor is with us today Senator
Baca to the committee member and
Senator Diamond who's out of the
audience today do either one of
you want to comment on the
field.

Addition of.

may in the potential for and to
clean in very very small
municipalities so we would.
Section.
the other large section.
Very with is.
We first of all she's under I'm
so his addition of language
clarifying the organizational
meeting first of all it takes
place and second of all the
removal of.
Of the please ality Act that
needed
there is also a section for
commission manager form of
government where it talks about
the organizational meeting at
which was added to that are
required to meetings for us and
we were just and.
For smaller commission chair
that sometimes they're going.
So we did not see that yes.
I'm requirements they would have
two meetings.
So.
There is concern about how the
they are like they're and
we fix all of that is right now
so this some of the commission
managers actually there appears
separately so
primarily the two meetings per
months
thank you Sir.
That the most part we agree
wholeheartedly with many of the
things that Senator is included.

Maestas.

line the bill we have a
legislative committee and he

earlier this thank you so much
Mr over now before I go to
members of the audience who are
in opposition of the bill those
are the ones whom who oppose the
bill if you can raise your hand
so we can get your name started
and then I'll colonies.
Are there any members of the
audience would like to speak in
opposition of Senate bill six.
Thing that I'm gonna wait a
minute or so well I have R. zoom
master right down those in
opposition Representative.
Mr Chairman what we're waiting
for that let me just simply
COVID in terms of Septimus
Johnston said and that is the
language about the commissioner
of the commission form of
government meeting twice a month
is actually language that comes
from such from currently current
law section three dash fourteen
dash eleven which is being
repealed and all we did was move
that existing language over to
that section.
I'm agnostic as to the
continuation of that language we
can we can strike that if they
would like but that but that's
what that was their lose that
we're repealing another section
of law we're just moving that
language over is.
Current law that is where a lot
of the required to meet at least
twice a month.
and so yes but but like I said I
mean.
It's I'll leave it up to the
committee as to whether or not
we should we should strike that
addition of which case then they
will they won't have the
requirement a lot to be twice a
month and that may or may not
be.
Something you know that we need
to have in state law so what we
find out if that other so before
we start commenting on the
amendments or for the bill we're
gonna head on out to those on
zoom were in opposition of
Senate bill six started with
Todd Hawthorne.
Thank you senators commissioner
for centers and Mr Chairman
I understand in in opposition to
this bill for six particular
reasons in particular I'm
surprised at the introduction of
this bill without clear
statement that it basically got
any opportunity for opposition
to the right.
the issues surrounding
Our ability to come in as a
whole challengers has been co
opted and I consider this to be
a direct assault on the
principle of principles of
transparency.
specifically the ability to
sense rulemaking began by Maggie
and removing the challengers
from the actual decision making
positions being able to see the
decisions made about which
ballots were accepted or
rejected and now continuing to
codify that problem the
specifics of allowing for
this social security number
elements to the room to be added
to the outside of the envelope
continues to be a problem and I
am opposed to being in a
position where we are removed
from those from those decision
making points the second is that
the government that
Governs least governs best this
is nothing more than a power
grab by Maggie Toulouse Oliver
and the clerks and their ability
to to control what is happening
in terms of training in terms of
Pacific with Paul challenges to
hello Hey the vast majority of
whole challengers are an
advantageous position and create
transparency and help to get the
message out of the election
results integrity.
It is it is a despicable display
of power grab I think that there
needs to be a serious concern
about the third principle is
that ideas have consequences in
words have meaning specifically
there are there's an attempt to
we defined terms like registered
agent registered officer
registration office.
And actually adding additional
power to the Clark by redefining
the role of the election board
itself.
Wonder for.
His transparency this is an
attempt to to he's eighty
oversight and give oversight
that the lead to give you
oversight control to the very
people who need to be overseen
it is not appropriate to have
those who are doing the work be
able to dictate who the overseer
might be at the end of the day
it is the electorate and the
role of the electorate is to
manage the election this is self
determination and the ability of
the individual precincts
themselves to determine who it
is that governments.
This oversight is nothing more
than the fox guarding the hen
house and Mr Ivey Soto
representation of this being
some sort of
agreed upon bill by all parties
is a misrepresentation of our
position for for I trained over
two thousand people in the state
of New Mexico on issues
surrounding election integrity
I've invited Senator Ivy Soto
personally to these chance for
training the training material
has been in the future both
nationally and locally by
multiple attorneys never one
single jot or tittle has ever
been suggested that the training
materials presented are somehow
incorrect along this is an
affront to the transparency in
the decision making authority
inside
the the statue state of New
Mexico I go one further to say
that this is it is critical that
we have the ability to determine
that
signatures and do signature
verifications if we do not do
that this is a continuation of
The to to.
Trav our election results in
secrecy in the rock to see thank
you Mr Hawthorne and the essence
of the time I need to move on to
those who were next to COVID
thank you for joining us this
morning.
The lane keeper.
The board.
Hello
my name is Elaine header and I
am commenting on sections.
On one twenty sixth through one
twenty nine sixteen and one
thirty they deal with MRG CD my
question is why bring up the
emergency the election and the
electorate during the short
session I can see cleaning up
election matters but this is a
big change to redefine what a
qualified electors to be
somebody lives benefited area
which could potentially
broadened with the new
definition including recreation.
From a property based ownership
will change the entire
collection for the emergency and
the constituents and I can
imagine that many water right
owners is not thrilled to find
that the vast majority of the
voting power would be helpless
people who have no connection
with their flights and they
would not feel that the process
was so truncated by filing today
and hearing today in in there
was a task force established in
the Senate memorial twenty one
that looked at whether changes
should be made.
They decided at that time not.
There were changes made in
twenty eighteen which will take
effect this year why not wait to
see how those will budget press
play out.
Then maybe have a new task force
to look at that to evaluate
those changes it anyway making
dramatic changes to the
emergency should be done more
deliberation in this process of.
There is even an FIR like the to
these kids please hold this over
for another day.
Say no to the changes focus on
the emergency in section sixteen
one twenty sixty one twenty nine
we want to thank you and my name
is Elaine having I am not
representing anybody but myself
I'm living here now thank you so
much and we're gonna wrap up
comments with Janice Arnold
Jones.
The committee Senator Ivey Soto
I stand at this moment in
opposition to this bill because
there is time to actually review
it
Concerns transparency has been
trounced that is not to say that
on some really excellent things
to help but I think that the
public deserves the opportunity
to talk about why challengers
and the third independent.
To be completely excluded from
our Alexion's.
I go to my.
To draw attention actually
question to one this to this one
point two it is required for
service up in the secretary of
state now I'm not.
But it made me wonder what
happens if some our club decides
to go to court and they have
this mean there cases now
dismissed are you making a
profit in telling the courts
have to decide.
I have issues with
having sixteen year old on the
board of elections and what it
does to the definition of
citizen and I I do think some of
the other people that I think
this bill is being held over
these today allow the public to
redo it and come back and
provide more detailed comments
and I thank you for your time.
Thank you so much for that the
Senators that wraps of all
comments both in the committee
room and I'm so we're not gonna
go on I'm gonna go on to teach
amendment for discussion I'm
gonna start off with Senator
Moores which is two two two two
two five dot one.
This proposed amendment which
was at Representative earlier
this morning is there any
discussion on the amendment I'm
gonna start with senator do the
for some quick this this would
be a from the moment okay.
Thank you.
So I I have two concerns with
this amendment
to number four on here which
strives educational institution
that would remove so from being
able to use student ID as well
and the seeking through to send
a registration
and that's we had a it and an
act of the languages and the
bills as a more streamlined
version but that was it existing
language that we had and
allowing folks to use I see
nineties
with photos on them
with the the information
otherwise matching and I don't
see any good reason to take that
out I did that and I think it is
good just gonna make it harder
for students who are perhaps
registered the first time in
becoming hopefully lifelong
voters to us to get involved in
the process and and fully
participate so I would suggest
striking number four from
Senator Moores is amendment and
then we can we can either just
that now or I can move on to my
my other concern thank you madam
minister madam by stature in
notice your vice chair judiciary
now the reason for that is is
because quite frankly student
ID's are very easy to forge and
fake we've all been in college
we've all seen the ID's there
they're not the same standard as
our driver's license or the
federal ID's and quite frankly
very easy to forge so all we
would ask for that to be limited
to the government issued ID's
and as you said I think there's
a fair fair compromise in
conversation that we had.
Thank you for that.
I don't know if we want to to
vote on taking that out now and
the move on the other issue with
the other issues first and then
sure okay us the other issue is
number five and this's inserting
the name of the qualified
elector on say a utility bill or
some other document.
So if there's.
I think it's okay to have the
name on there but I was want the
language to match the language
that we see on page thirty three
starting at line three which
says contains the name of the
qualified elector shall
reasonably match the name
provided on the strip give
registration so that folks
aren't rejecting documentation
because you know a name is
slightly different from the name
that that they're seeking to
register under and so those
those would be my two motions
are for on to mend Senator
Moores as amendment and the Mr I
may the second one.
my understanding so so my
understanding is Senator it's
not us district number five she
simply asking to take the
language that is on lines four
and five up above so that it
would say contains the name of
the qualified elector.
Come up with child reasonably
match the name provided on this
to get a registration comma.
And is that correct okay at the
yeah Mr Senator what is your
concern on that I think it's
just consistency yeah Mr chair
Senator it's it's consistency
and also making sure that that
there is room for common sense
in reviewing the drive location
or Richard verses of the of the
command or something perfect
thank you for that now the
Senator Ivy Soto what is your
position on the proposed
amendments to four and five so
on number five if we take up
number five first number I I
think is a it's a it's a family
member from me and up to the
family also yeah so we could I
think we can just do that by
unanimous consent or something.
That.
Fe numbers that do we all agree
that it's.
Taking into account that.
The objective.
The health section.
Thank you noted what's number
four.
And I would say that you would
like me to restate it for sure
if you don't mind sure so it
would just be striking number
four completely which would have
the effect of so allowing
that the fiscal ID that is
provided when doing same day
registration would include ID
from an educational institution.
In addition to the other
documentation as required and
rest of the.
And Mr levy on from like for the
reasons stated earlier thank
you.
That are not Mr chairman I'll
just act I can with the way in
that I will note that our
definition of required voter
identification at one dash one
dash twenty four.
from which much of this is based
although not work work does
include there are.
this is for people who register
for the first time by mail and
have to show some kind of.
documents ready it does include
a student identification in that
list so so certainly it would be
it would be consistent to have
that in there but
That's a the decision I would
leave to the to the committee we
do have come in from Senator
Baca.
I know Mister chair I was just
initially Senator Duhigg major
motion and it was a.
Both both for both of the
amendments of Watson I was
simply going to suggest that we
buy for Kate that which we did
thank you senator.
Senator Lopez if you have thank
you Mr chairman I of agree with
Senator Duhigg of ours to
leaving in of the language for
an educational institution for
purposes of employment Lee do
accept as.
An educational institution as
one of the ID's also and if the
person has a disability this
also think could preclude them
from being able to if they don't
have an actual state issued ID
they don't drive I think this is
another opportunity for them to
be able to have an
identification and I realize and
I understand what senator Wirth
the same but on the other hand
you do have others who do
recognize the educational
institution especially for sorry
for purposes of employment.
Thank you Senator Senator Baca.
Thank you Mr chair you know the
with the I I would I would
propose a striking of that
portion of the amendment Mr
chair the reason why is really
citizenship we have a these
these identifications of many
times given out to for
individuals individuals that are
I'm not U. S. citizens not
members of the district the the
latitude given to educational
ideas is far greater than that
given to of federal ID state
issued driver's licenses state
issued ID's I think we kind of
leave a gaping hole
to leave these educational
identifications within the
language thank.
Thank you so much I want to
pursue the senator Wirth and
then Senator program.
So two things that does concern
me our center Ivey Soto to the
extent that we have.
This language in different
sections and we're gonna go and
take it out here it's a pretty
important I mean this is for a
qualified elector seeking to
register to vote or update so
this is a eight a very
significant change that and I
will just say that that there I
recent Lopez I I know for a fact
both my kids.
You know went through this stage
and have friends that work
driving who were you know in
college or for the internet in
high school and so basically
that was there their form of ID
and I just I'm not I understand
that and I hear center more of
what you're saying about.
The possibility for the easier
to be a draft I I just think
that that this could have a lot.
Consequences for our our younger
voters and we're talk a lot
about younger voters during this
session so I again I I
appreciate Senator doing.
Making what I guess is an
amendment to the amendment okay
a little interesting
But that's where that's where it
is so that is my my thoughts
thank you so much New Mexico to
go to Senator Pirtle.
Thank you Mr chair
Senator I do have a few concerns
with with pulling this and and
my main concern is you know what
we define an educational
institution as is that in
definition somewhere in this
section of law.
Mr chairman and several of the
use of education institution an
existing the existing locations
in.
The election code does not
define what can what constitutes
an educational institution.
And I will note that the
existing language right now.
Four
same day registration.
That is.
That is in law at this time.
Is a little bit different but
not much of just as a current
valid.
student photo identification
card from postsecondary
education institution in New
Mexico that actually says a
covered by current fees
statement that contains the
students address and the county
although I don't.
I don't know of any students
that care there few statements
run with them.
but we do.
We do allow though
with with those restrictions.
Currently percent of
registration
but in and no place.
In a place where we talk about
in the press secretary
institutions for forest or force
the school identification do we
actually define that term.
And and Mr chair center I
appreciate that now I think I
understand better what a post
secondary education is and there
there can be a little bit of
common sense applied to that in
eastern New Mexico university
Ross will you and them in in in
my college but with just the
term educational institution I
could create one of those now if
I home school my kids and print
one off at home and then you
would be forced to use this
photo ID because my home then
becomes an educational
institution because I home
school my children and that can
become very problematic in the
way that it is written so I
think the since we are talking
about same day registration we
need to be very careful what
what we do and how we broaden
that and you know just using
that term is very problematic
what is an educational
institution we have a list of
those is every single person
that's looking at these ID's
gonna know every single
educational institution within
the state and so I think it's
very very problematic for me to
to not strike this in the maybe
further down the line we can
come up with better language to
put back in but at the very
heart of to to pass this out of
this committee with with that
language in thank you Mr chair
thank you so much any other
comments Senators.
Certificate just ask Senator
Duhigg real quick how she would
feel about simply change the
language to say instead of
important educational
institution that the lack of
respect for postsecondary
educations to.
And Mister chair Mister chair
I have heard about that because
we are going to be having a
discussion about
potentially other younger voters
being able to register and in
the future who might not be
adequate secondary educational
institution they might still be
in high school and so or there
are also a seventeen eighteen
year olds who are under current
law eligible to register who
might not be adequate secondary
institutions there's a high
school so I would I would I
don't I would not want to insert
that line for.
Any other comments.
The no other comments the clerk
to call the roll.
The motion unscented to table so
I I move to strike number four
from Senator Moores as
amendment.
Senator Baca nope Senator Duhigg
yes Senator Ingle.
No Senator Lopez yeah Senator
Moores no Senator TCP no yes
Senator Pirtle no Senator Wirth
yes Senator had a meal yes and
Senator Ivey Soto.
This is.
Dyslexic with right now that it
would be with a yes it would be
seven to four now.
So with the no you'd be five to
six hello
Senator Stewart it right yes.
Just a note.
I agree with the noted time yes.
Both refined Center store where
she.
Present and.
On education
Thank this is an issue that
could if it affects other.
Of the things that of the bills
that could be dealt with in the
bill I'm gonna vote no.
Mr Chairman I'm gonna make and
I'm gonna suggest an amendment
now to number four.
That is set of.
Well I'm I'm I'm gonna suggest
action that we strike number.
Yeah there's.
To.
About.
But.
The motion fails and now we're
gonna be hearing if you have a
amendment I do and the amendment
amendment and Mr chairman it
would be that we strike number
four.
And insert in lieu thereof.
On page thirty three.
Line.
One.
Strike M..
And insert a post secondary.
So strike the current number
four and in this place.
Page thirty three line one
strike M. and insert in its
place a post secondary.
Is there a second on the motion.
Discussion about.
Senator Ortiz.
So Mister chairman and and of
Senator Ivey Soto you're you're
thinking that the problem that
you're amendment would create if
we adopted with.
Later Legisla- other bills are
under consideration in this
session opening up of younger
voters we could do with that
then.
That your that your contention
Mr chairman yes officer in
certificate of so I can be
hazardous I would like to take
this bill on the merits of this
bill.
And in terms of equipment of
this bill I hear what Senator
Duhigg the issue that she
raised.
and I think most of the issue
that she raised not all of it
can be addressed by by by
following.
it to be and I do buy a post
secondary institution so that
would be by the federal
government a state government a
federally recognized Indian
nation tribe or pueblo for an
education institution for post
secondary education institutions
right so that that so so that's
how that line would read.
Under this amendment and then.
That deals with this bill for
the purposes of this bill.
With there's a hearing on
another bill we can deal with
issues on that bill and from a
compilation Steinborn the later
signed into law.
would be the one that would go
into law in addition to that
this has an emergency clause and
I don't believe the other bill
has an emergency clause so
therefore worst case scenario
regardless of the order which
they are adopted if we have the
mercy Clause on this one then it
would
If the other bill gets gets
massaged in this area that would
ultimately when that goes into
effect that would ultimately
the.
Well Mr chairman and Senate week
we currently do allow eighteen
year olds to vote and then maybe
in high school.
And and and and your amendment
doesn't really deal with the you
know of of such a potential
voter eligible voters being able
to register if they don't also
have a driver's license which a
lot of kids these days may not
be having driver's licenses and
Mr chairman and senator but I I
do understand that I do
understand and it leaves it has
a somewhat imperfect situation
but but at least and for those
in a post secondary institution
they could use or student ID.
For those who are in post
secondary correct including the
high school students who are
dually enrolled.
In New Mexico they get it they
get a post secondary I think
that is a fact yes.
That includes a few more Mr
chairman but not all and and I
mean I think yours is better
than this language.
But.
I mean if it is better than the
proposed the then Senator Moores
language of just eliminating it
but our okay thank you Mr
chairman of think about.
That are more that's your
position on this.
Are funded on friendly we've
been working on this bill in
good faith and working together
the collaborative really for a
long time
if you don't want to work
collaboratively with the you
know it's it's it's in the
consulate that the majority just
want sex every single step to be
exactly what they want and
that's the problem with the the
environment in this country
right now you guys don't want to
work with us only referred us to
the table next time thank you.
So if I could just respond the
in all due respect I believe
this is being presented for the
first time this morning so this
wasn't part of my my correct and
this this and this this is a new
amendment so I I again I I I the
amount of work that's gone into
this bill is something that I
think we should all.
Appreciate because it has
involved in operation but I I
just think we've got to be
careful saying somehow that
having a vigorous and food
policy debate over something
that I think is is very.
Relevant.
Issue that's been brought up
Senator Duhigg somehow turn this
into a partisan fight because I
don't think that's what it is I
think senator Morris you know
this is exactly what we did when
we work on the Senate rules in
this committee we talked about
language and for something
that's coming up for the first
time I I I just don't accept
that this is a turning this into
a partisan debate I think that's
exactly what what you asked that
we do and celebrated that we did
in this committee is we have a
discussion about language and we
debated and ultimately we take a
vote on it and and I I don't
want I don't want to I don't
under consultation center with
the three hundred thirty pages
that we've been working with on
the majority on as you heard
there's couple comments about
some legitimate comments about
the the
the challengers and we've worked
on that and we from we pray
together and we've you know in
this stated day and age that's a
huge issue we work with the
majority on that and but it
seems like no matter what we
bring up from certain senators
it's automatically just put
aside this is a very good
amendment that could get
Republican support to help us
get past us been of this day in
age with everything that's gone
on this country and what we hear
from a certain centers like well
it's not good enough then I can
give you guys anything this is a
very small part.
These are these can be forced
you are you looking at New
Mexico military institute third
of the students in New Mexico
military students are important
for students under this language
that you guys wanted Pima
Institute would be an
educational.
Do we really want that to be an
official ID Pima medical
institute so those are kind of
things these are very simple
things so.
This was done in good faith we
were we sat down for a long long
time working on things to get us
to a place where we're
comfortable if you guys don't
want the swamp monsters pull
back the amendment to the judges
pass whatever.
This is part of the process you
guys want to work with us I
appreciate it but then when you
work with us not to agree with
us or not to work with us and go
back with it that's the
frustration we're feeling on our
side Senator Wirth so please if
you wanna work together for the
other or just pass whatever you
guys want to pass but I'm
personally sat down with the
sponsor of this bill to I want
to get to a place where we can
support this with everything
that's happened structure last
two years.
I want to support this bill.
Don't run I just part little
person victory for.
So just yeah I don't know back
and forth here but I do think
that you know the sponsor bill
brought up the fact that we've
got language and fathers
sections of the law that now
this is going to contradict with
so again I just think there's
some there's legitimate
discussion about how to do this
I I I look at I really respect
the fact that the committee you
have worked with with the
sponsor on this and work and
this is pretty amazing that work
we're this this far along this
idea last thing you want to use
is it is the rail this and so on
some very sensitive to that but
I also do think this is a
legitimate issue and and I just
speak for myself personally and
and you know with I I just I
feel like the issue of of
encouraging our our younger
folks to be engaged in the vote
we should be making that easier
not harder and that's a that's a
real philosophical issue you
know for me and and which is why
again the position I took some
this is a good discussion to
have I don't want to minimize it
for minutes but again I think we
need to figure out the navigate
through this
but I also you know the end of
the day you know we've got a.
Determine if we're moving
forward we're changing the
language and I think right now
we're on.
Propose I'm not sure center I'm
sort of out of prison amendment
you've made.
At this point I think you have
me that that I'm sorry motion
you've made that in order to
have the post secondary yeah I
think that's what and and drawn
your honor.
And Mr Chairman
and members I'm.
So
like there's a there is a
As was discussed there's a
there's another bill
That is
where some of these issues may
be able to get flushed out
You know hi.
Frankly.
At this time let me let me if I
if I did make the motion let me
withdraw at.
so it will be before us for the.
Senator Moores amendment with
the change on number five.
Thank you so much for that our
morning appointment with the
changed number five.
For
anyone.
I'm I'm curious when it when the
title was read yesterday I I did
a double take over the raised.
Repealing the public policy
regarding parent.
Is that a joke we're we were
kidding was there something in
here that does repeal the public
policy regarding parent or.
So Mr chairman and senator being
out so we have an article.
I think it's a chapter ten
article four of the statutes.
that is our public policy
regarding parent we require all
coming this to register with the
secretary of state's office I
think every six months or
something like that.
it is more often than sex
offenders it doesn't agree right
defend but what you did and the
fall and that's I mean it's
obviously unconstitutional so we
just put that in as a repeal
some folks said Hey can we.
Can we not do that in this bill
can we maybe do that some other
time.
As like well it's
unconstitutional it's been in
the statutes anyway I think it
was a doctor in nineteen fifty
four.
And so we're just striking the
the requirement that.
And and so we're striking that
which which one of the amendment
strikes that one of the what
strikes that is number two and
number
Fifteen and yeah that's actually
where the article is it's it's
article for those would like to
look it up sometimes chapter
twelve article four.
Well for one through twelve for
three.
And the so the deal with the
political party
that was not listening to have
it of this bill but you know
it's that is certainly not
something that I to prove
importance.
upon which the next election
will deliver nice so.
Be sure jails are full of.
Well you know I mean given that
we were also the world so.
Right striking the.
The two hundred.
No for no alcohol there were a
couple people who were for
please that we're taking care of
the trump communists.
Or.
Very upset so so that's that's
what it is it's it's one of
these idiosyncratic sections of
all that some point we'll have
to taken out it just will be in
the.
Okay any other discussion.
The the discussion.
If you can take the role of the
amendment as amended.
Yes Senator.
That will yes.
The best number.
Senator Moores yes Senator Ortiz
Y. Pino.
Yes.
The girl yes.
Senator Stewart.
Yes.
Senator Stewart our test of this
level Senator had a meal yes
Senator Ivey Soto yes ma'am.
With a vote of ninety two.
The amendment as the amendment
have to.
We're not gonna move on to
Center were to explain about
thank you Mr order right as of
the reference the other villain
Senate Bill Page which I am
sponsoring with Representative
Martinez and Senator Duhigg
others.
I do not agree with that
language and I appreciate
session that we have with
respect to the number four and
so we will address that in the
other bill and figure out of the
way and ensuring that we can
come up with with something that
works one of the state that
publicly thank you thank you so
much we're not gonna move on to
amendment two two two two three
zero dot one.
The proposed amendment was.
With that talked about earlier
this morning and I would want to
discuss your amendment yes I
move the best and then actually
turned me off I think I I
noticed that you left out one
section of your amendment if I
just could and that would be a
section and I and I think it's
it's is of the nature that I
could just tell people what it
is this is for the deputy clerks
right so so the first secretary
of the section two says clerks
and deputy clerks section three.
There and the server section one
of four yield of this initial
composition course of what was
left out was the deputy clerks
which would be an additional
five hundred dollars for holding
Corp one certificate additional
fifteen hundred dollars for
holding for two or nutritional
twenty five hundred dollars will
hold it for three additional
three thousand holder park for
and that tracks the language for
the assessors I would just be an
amendment to the amendment that
yeah that would that would that
would just that would just
complete this ammendment that is
correct.
If there's no objection any
objection to that.
So.
So this is a whole new you you'd
be adding another thing to this
with the addition of the this
that should have been included
that as in the that clarifies
what the deputy clerks would
receive around that's correct.
And it tracks of the assessors
and us.
The best land aligned with
further discussion point seven
points are huge Center to secure
this as my questions want to
make sure it's completely tracks
with what we're doing for the
assessors do we do it for the
treasurers or anyone else or
just these two
County officers job Mr chairman
senator Morris discusses of have
that in place for some time
we don't have that for the other
county offices we probably
should at some point I will
indicate that the.
The there is an accredited
program through NMAA you where a
lot of the county clerks have
been and W. kind of course have
been getting a fair amount of
training
and it's it's a nationally
accredited program where they
take classes usually in person
right now is them and it and it
goes over speed option is kind
of some of the finer details of
how to do things and and whatnot
so it's a and and it has a
different of the certificates
you can be a of a certified part
you could be a certified public
officer a certified public
manager in this program so every
record a program if it's at
NMSU.
You know.
But I get it this this is this
is this is why the bump in pay
isn't any higher but we don't
and we don't do this for the the
statewide officers not correct
that is does not have to
distance thank you thank you.
Any other discussion or
opposition to the amendment.
There was a motion by orders for
a pass on the about section of
the and it won't move to pass on
then that as amended.
That is that.
Okay perfect any opposition.
The land we're gonna move on to
the next
Mr chairman the next one is
Senator Stewart.
Which is the one that says to
Senate bill six at the top and
the simply in three places
strikes or committee our
political committee of the
political parties concerts and
this place a campaign committee
or legislative caucus committee.
Senator David.
Thank you Mr I think there's
just there's a type of this
amendment and one spot that was
missed so I think that the third
sentence that's on here should
say page one seventy six not one
seventy four thank you and then
on the top of page one seventy
five line one Stewart says a
political committee we should
take that out and insert that
that language about a campaign
committee or provided cost where
is that on page.
Line one page one seventy five
this is for folks who have
signed up to do the automated
yes yes yes yes you are correct.
I would propose those two
amendments to this actually
actually yeah and I would just
simply be.
It's a strike with a political
committee.
On that one.
Yes yes yes yes Mr chairman
right right.
Mr chair will that then.
Yeah Senator.
We're good.
The right now run the amendment
the amendments that are
typically to make question sure
asked I would
how many amendments to on page
one seventy five line one strike
with a political committee and
then on the third sentence of
them as we see before us and Sir
page one seven four should be
one seventy six.
From the discussions are private
sector.
The friendly amendment Senator
well we access in this
tournament.
I am the first time for.
The box.
From the moment I'm also from
the with the very.
We're all friends.
We are all friends give.
Any discussion.
On the amendment to the
amendment.
Up.
I think that mission.
Motion has been made for the
benefit members.
No opposition.
No opposition.
Right.
That done with.
Okay store development.
Madam chair representative I'm
sorry.
I moved up to the minute
amendment.
There's been a motion for the
adoption of the amendment
amendment.
Second by senator Morris note
I'm actually question okay
percentage of the ones thank you
Mr so think about pro tempore
so.
The who would then who who taken
out the just give me a real
world examples just like when
the honorary or divorce you
groups on both sides or.
Development group Senators sites
and all those emails of state I
give us five dollars Wilder
fighting for you in Santa Fe
they make so much money off
doing still to be able to do
that what we're just banning all
of us in our committees and all
the candidates running for
offices in the governors and all
that their band but all those
fund raisers out there to be
able to.
So those very important to be
mailed out.
Mr chairman that's what we have
right now yeah.
That's we have right now and
certainly the analysis off on
this bill says that
constitutional to do this we can
do it to ourselves and so that's
what this ammendment does it it
ensures that we continue to not
be able to raise funds for the
federal during the period
for the soul groups.
Thankfully the status now with
this ammendment.
Thank you for those.
Hello.
About.
Senator do K. yes Senator Ingle.
Yes.
Senator Wirth yes.
Senator for.
Senator Stewart yes.
Senator Wirth yes.
Yes.
Yes and so.
From.
For the vote of eight two one
one three nine two one amended
amendment.
Half of the council.
Mr chair that I have that are
directly bill Harrison officers
his real quick we did have to
other.
the other one which ones yes
correct one on page one ninety
six.
Lines eighteen and nineteen.
Which were.
Two of the strike.
from the word and.
To the end of the sentence that
municipality.
And then also online twenty and
twenty three.
to strike the employment
language on each of those.
I
so the but for the.
One eight four eight four
employees twenty three four to
be employed.
I don't remember we voted on
that one or not.
I don't think we did.
Thank you for that and that that
one is yes yeah that that are
the excellence.
Well okay yes these all I'll
bring up the other thing that Mr
Austin profitable.
Yeah so this gentleman it would
be a page one ninety six line
eighteen to nineteen straight
from the and through the agency
polity line twenty strike or
employee line twenty three
strike for to be employed.
It is a different.
Any opposition both no
opposition and then Mr chairman
finally on we have on page two
forty two line seven strike the
word watershed the inserts on
water conservation district.
Just to clarify the appointed
person is from.
The money the governor yes page
two forty two line seven strike
watershed and search all want
conservation the new level yes
Sir.
Any opposition urging no
opposition and I see that a new
amount must come before us and
then problem Mr chairman I just
real quick question whether or
not the committee wanted to
strike the language about
commission chair former
government having to be twice a
month.
If we do that would be page one
ninety nine plans twenty four
and twenty five we would just
strike those two lines.
On page one ninety nine.
Mr Mr chair that's the minutes
league so that's yeah that's
that's the concern that was
raised by miss Johnston that is
existing language for another
section of law but I'm basically
would let them decide when they
make.
The votes of governments are.
Senator that.
Mr chair by.
this the conversation.
Yet Mr chairman I have many
times about focus for locals I'm
not liable for that I I don't
know all the implications of
taking that out of existing law
at this time and so I'm hesitant
to make that change now without
having I just want to make sure
we didn't so that's my.
Any opposition I don't know of
you will be back okay district
in my house is raising Medicaid
somebody want to make it I was
not making.
Well so I think Senator thank
you Mr chairman and senator I I
do have a concern that in an
election bill we're getting way
too detailed about telling local
governments how they should be
conducting their own business of
even and I was going to bring up
the whole issue around the the
the number of petitions and how
much it cost and things like
that I I'm not sure that it's
really the state legislatures
business to tell a local
government if you want to run if
if anybody in your city wants to
run for the city council they
have to do these things they
should be setting those
guidelines up the it's hard not
to get anybody to run for some
of those positions
so it and this thing doesn't
really belong in an election
bill the the.
The the.
Early this is new material we're
adding in some of the members
underlined just just to be clear
it is shown as new material yeah
but it is language that comes
from another sexual three dash
fourteen dash eleven that we're
repealing.
So we're just simply moving the
content from one section to
another there were some other
things in that of the section
law that that that we're not
applicables so we we repeal that
section law and just simply move
the language.
Yeah I I'm still torn with the
idea of just of of telling that
the kind of local government you
gotta meet twice a month for
that should be up to them to
decide off in the the the the
needs of I would propose that
amendment and if nobody else
will for.
It's just the deletion Mr
chairman of on page one ninety
nine
deleted of section see on line
twenty four and twenty five for.
From the moment.
It is a preliminary.
Remove any opposition.
Any discussion.
Further debate Mr chair I'll
just say again I I'm not gonna
vote for this right now only
because I I suspect there might
be implications beyond this
that I would like to explore I'm
not against the concept and in
theory I.
But I want to make sure I I
understand the the overall
impact the that that change
existing law what half before
before striking thank you
senator any further discussion.
All.
Senator okay not.
Senator Ingle zone anymore.
Past.
Senator Lopez.
Senator Moores.
Yes Senator Ortiz Y. Pino yes.
Senator.
Sure.
Nope.
Senator Wirth no.
Senator Ingle.
For.
To.
For one thing.
Well.
Perfected you Senator Wirth.
Okay Senator as of this.
Most of the state.
What is that called me a motion
and a half.
The motion failed and the
ballot for the a new amendment
have just for the fourth
amendment two two two two three
nine point one from Senator to
the.
Yes this ammendment.
does those two things on page
eighteen
line I it would insert the were
reasonable and and what's
happening in this part of the
bill is that this is talking
about.
Well
challenges our workers
essentially have have not.
All the rules about what they
are permitted and that the
permitted and prohibited
activities for them on that they
would then not be allowed to be
watchers are challengers for
that the next defer that
Alexion's level and the next one
afterwards and this is requiring
that there if that's gonna
happen that there be
documentation about what has
happened to justified
keeping this folks out in those
cycles I I I like that there is
documentation destructive
described that I just want to
insert the word reasonable
before specificity because what
I want to have happen is for it
to end up in a fight over you
did not we didn't level not for
that what happened there for you
keeping me out is about so.
Adding that reason ability
standard just addresses that
concern without changing the
overall need for it the stuff to
be documented.
And then I can so I can stop we
can address that one first and
then the other the other one is
just want to go through all of
this short so the other one on
page seventy one.
This deal with the the happen T.
envelope verification process
that Mr chair described when he
was talking about the bill
overall
And and you'll see that the
process that has laid out here.
In my opinion is can be
simplified I what I actually
really like I would love to hear
from the course that we have
here today about.
How this might affect their
workloads and and whether.
But a simplified approach to
this.
How it might work understanding
that they can't speak for the
court's affiliate groups believe
it has not had an opportunity to
to review this and vote on it is
actually what this would do is
that would make it so that
After correct under this bill
you have to request absentee
ballots by fourteen days before
the election starting with the
thirteenth after the election
when the absent voter election
board means they would do a one
time audit of envelopes that is
based on one percent of the
overall requests that were made
which will be of some certain at
that point because the deadline
for making this request will
have passed at that point and
then we have in there it's one
percent for at least twenty
ballots because some of the
those smaller counties are one
percent could very well be to
balance and everyone have a an
audit size large enough so that
the meeting for a PO so they
would still keep the language
that if something is off the
networks are required to to go
back in and check everything by
it makes it so that they're not
having to that that the eight
absent voter election board is
not having to him check in
larger counties centrally
hundreds of ballots every day
when the meeting which my
understanding is and will
hopefully hear from the courts
that they would like to that
that would be incredible
adds to their workload
I think we can we not have undue
burden on the parks and still
achieve.
What the session is seeking to
achieve I have a and an overview
of the verification process of
those on.
And so that that is what that
second change makes and I see
that that for Clark is if you
want to come up to the table and
then I'm going to remind you to
state your name again for the
record.
Hi and Kathryn Clark in the
Santa Fe county clerk and I just
wanna say they don't speak for
the rest of the clerks but in my
County we experience kind of
delays in the postal service so
if we had to do verification of
all of the ballots overall even
on the thirteenth day because
like for instance during the
regular local election we had
convened an election board to
verify the balance but we didn't
have the vast majority of those
ballots until like the last
seven days of the election so if
we were held to one percent of
what have been sent out I'm not
sure I would have had all those
ballots in hand by the
thirteenth day I think we would
prefer to do it by based on
batches so fully verified.
The whole batch and we did one
percent and then another day off
one percent you know similar to
how we verify the machines were
we take a batch of each machine
and verify that that machine is
correctly counting Development
hand tally
for me and my County based on
our process and I can't speak
for the other clerks would be
easier if we could take one
percent for percentage.
of each of the like every day's
batch of verification to make it
easier for us if for instance we
don't happen to have all the
ballots that are backed because
voters doing to last minute and
we have drop boxes in our county
in a lot of voters were using
those at the very last minute
so.
Thank you thank you Mr
just to clarify this would not
require them to do it on that
thirteen state before it would
just be that would be the
earliest point at which you can
do it because that's the point
which you know the some certain
of how many were requests but
but understanding that the the
goal of this is to make make the
administration of this easier
for the clerks so if there's
another approach that makes it
easier for the clerk's.
Right I am I am not committed to
this approach specifically all
I'm seeking to do in this
ammendment is is take some
approach that reduces the
administrative burden of this
process while still hi achieving
I've what I assume to be the
policy goals of this section
thank you for those comments
thank you Senator to head is
that I reset my this is a
friendly or unfriendly.
No Mr Chairman I find the
amendment number one.
To be a friendly amendment act.
I would ask Senator Duhigg if
she would consider.
On number two instead of making
it one percent making it two
percent for the greater of
twenty dollars or two percent.
And Mr chair
Senator
With that you know that it would
become a permanent sure I.
That yes.
Thank you we'll accept that and
then that becomes a friendly
amendment and so if you can
repeat what changes are the
amendment please.
Sure I'd be on that number two
in that paragraph.
Third line from the bottom
sampling of official mailing
envelopes equal to two percent
of mailed ballots requests are
twenty mail ballots whichever is
greater that is the changing
from one to two.
So did the amendment to the
amendment yes yes and that's
that is friendly friendly
amendment amendment okay.
Got any discussion so no more to
the thank you Mr so even at two
percent I would think we're
really watering down the
requirements
I assumed Harding County Cork
would still very the twenty
votes that we're talking about
here with Bernalillo county it's
still probably worth two
thousand votes but also you're
checking on here I mean it's
pretty low.
I'm sorry I can't.
I don't believe those are the
number of members with Dona Ana
County at the festival going
this time of of the ledger
actually I think once you
counterparts we will be going to
comment to those of that is.
We can get questions from
experts answered.
Thank.
Mr chair if I may I I believe
that Bernalillo county clerk is
on the zoom and perhaps they
could it could address that
question for Bernalillo.
Let us over you still up.
I am thank you.
Of course we are in favor of the
friendly amendment makes it that
more about them.
but the current that Mr chairman
Matt Clark at the end of the
current language it would be
much higher
versus what the amendment as
well so what what would be the
number of early County versus
what the house currently
reverses what the amended
amendment does.
Two percent for the first hello
and and and Mr Chairman just
real quick just as their answer
the question and and maybe I can
help out with with for the
question.
Under the current.
Language in the bill.
For any amount greater than ten
thousand one percent.
Representative verses this would
be a staff to percent so how
many Madam park.
How many E. mail ballots the the
Bernalillo kind of receiver the
last general election more life
so I'm looking at right now so
this is like cutting counties
the twenty votes Bernalillo
county's over ten thousand votes
into your food that I assume
that's the the goal post if you
will is and so it's going to two
percent versus protecting would
actually be more for the so
realistic counties probably you
don't have to more ten thousand
you.
Senator more Senator Campos we
had a hundred forty thousand.
Yes Representative so to drive
home and you guys have a.
About eleven thousand.
So you'd be about have the two
thousand two thousand two
percent under this amendment
okay thank you.
Very good I'm very glad that the
county court security officer
district thank you senator any
other comments on the amendment.
That as as amended in this
press.
For the.
Educated we're we're gonna first
take a vote on the amendments to
the amendment so that's what I
know wanted to right and I think
the phone okay are not any
opposition to the amendment to
on
the Nov physician or.
Mr chair I would move the
amendment as men okay there has
been a move that that moved and
so if you want one.
Incentives we content with them
number three still includes the
same okay.
If I can take role.
All the for promotional offers.
Yes what the changed from one to
present is firmly.
Yes.
Yes Senator Lopez yes.
Senator Morris yes.
Yes Senator Pirtle yes Senator
Stewart yes Senator work yeah
Senator have you.
In terms of the yes ma'am.
And I I I was Center boards it's
it's it's helpful having the
courts president and and and I
have a discussion about these.
And are we don't the last to go
back to Mr chair move it to pass
on Senate bill six has fifty
times amended
first the center Lopez with the
question.
Senator Lopez asked thank you
very much Mr chairman I have a
question as was mention of
course by miss Hubbard in some
of her concerns.
Mr chairman this is on page two
twenty seven.
Line twenty two.
And I would just like to have
some clarification as to the
language this listed on to go to
line twenty one basis only
persons who are qualified
electors and we're striking land
and landowners at the district
shall be eligible to vote in the
election may I ask Mr Leri
striking.
Certainly is.
The.
Certainly so the reason is what
this bill.
We are probably completed the
process that we've been on for
about fifteen years to move all
of the local public bodies in
the state away from voting by
land ownership and to voting by
voter registration.
Voting by land ownership I
believe is unconstitutional.
this is I I very much appreciate
the willingness of pick a
politician Conservancy district
no regret a Conservancy district
actually Conservancy district
and others to engage in
conversation about about making
this change this is a this is
something that is been in the
works for this.
Twenty plus years of discussion.
this this comes using language
that is was working on with the
middle Rio Grande Conservancy
district.
And so and and the thing is.
That the the current process
that we have an emergency the
first of all I believe to be
unconstitutional.
would be restricted to
landownership verses registered
voters.
executable excuse me.
When you have qualified electors
that are landowners with regard
to the emergency dear you
actually end up with situations
where you have people who've
never been to New Mexico we get
to vote.
You have corporations who get to
vote.
And you have people who are
leasing land and farming who
don't get to vote.
I think local decisions are to
the local in the army from
people in the community.
And that's what this does.
Mr chairman and I appreciate
that but when you look is to.
I guess the question I have
Mister chairman so are you
stating then that you have been
in conversation and the
Conservancy district from MRG CD
has been in favor of this.
Mr chairman and Senator Lopez
aka and all the others who are
on the Conservancy board are in
favor of removing this provision
Mr Chairman answer Lopez they
have not taken the final vote
because of the timing of their
meetings.
However this is language that
was crafted in conjunction with
the MRG CD and with the
specifically the legislative
team from emergency the of which
all three o'clock as far back up
walking Baca and the there's
another with a hyphenated
bargaining.
all the more on that all of a
program that committee and and
so this incorporates the
language that we worked on
together in order to make that
happen.
Okay yes and I just you know for
me Mr chairman I hadn't heard of
of the change in the agreement
to this I just have some serious
concerns and of course the
Conservancy district is not just
in my area south valley but it
goes from you know where the
uncle students starts further up
north and it goes all the way
south so I'm just concerned as
to what this change will make
again not just for my district
but for those who are to the
south of me and others
and again I've and it's not just
Mr ever but I receive some other
concerns on email for their like
you know what's going on here
what are we taking away because
Mr chairman other undue
influence from persons who live
within the district may not
understand the issues we talk
about water water distribution
the LESC yes and all of the
other concerns that are have
long been an issue for those of
us who have
First I say of.
Constituents who actually live
in the valley and understand the
concerns are being raised so I
have some very serious concerns
about removing and landowners
and again Mr chairman I haven't
heard from the Conservancy
district for my Representative
anyone on this yet so I have
some.
His concerns at this point so
thank you.
Thank you for your comments
Senator Senator Ortiz Y. Pino.
Thank you Mr chairman it yeah
and I I share those those
concerns I think and and and and
in some ways you're you're log
rolling here because you're
including in a bill on election
issues.
Which is you know these are very
important this is there's been a
lot of negotiating over the
election we're certainly is
sticking in major changes in the
nature of the Conservancy
district the mid Rio Grande
Conservancy district and and and
I don't I mean I know you say
you've been negotiating with
three boxes but.
That I'm not at all sure that
this is been run by the
membership of the Conservancy
district you know one of the
issues there is.
And and and.
You know.
People who read it in that in
that district enormous the
there's thousands of people who
rent in the in.
They would be in the position of
being able to reduce the or
increase the taxation and not
have to pay and they don't have
to pay it it's only the people
who own land that pay the
taxation on the and so it just
seems to me to change this
major.
In the nature of the Conservancy
district shouldn't be inability
dealing essentially with
elections and and and and pull
watching and whether you can
drink alcohol in the enough is
that those are all of related to
the ballots but this is the this
is a significant change in the
very heart of what of the
Conservancy district is I would
love to see this remove dead and
maintenance a separate bill if
you feel strongly that they
should be done I can't vote for
the bill if you're gonna that in
it I'll just tell you right off
and not that one vote is going
to make that much difference but
it does strike me that this is
kind of slipping something in
that really shouldn't be and and
a bill dealing adjust with
elections Senator Ortiz Y. Pino
Mr Thompson is with us is the
lobbyist for the conservative
district did not take any
position Mr chairman members of
the committee morning but.
Our board has been book ended by
our meetings we meet once a
month I cannot tell you that we
have an official for physician
on this measure we have had
dialogue with Senator Ivy Soto
on this in regards to the
language but I cannot stand here
today and tell you one way or
the other that we voted up or
down that's the honest truth
chairman of the committee thank
you thank you Mr Thompson
Senator to the people anymore
comments.
No I mean that.
That and I I guess
if I had well if I may Senator
said this on the so senator Dino
and and and the local to.
But I would like the opportunity
after I say what I say right now
but also yield the secretary of
state for her to talk about some
of the so the practical
implications but I want to make
also very clear.
That at the time we passed the
local agent.
The Conservancy districts were
brought into the regular
collection.
Of act July one twenty twenty
two.
at the time we knew that we're
gonna have to make additional
changes.
At the time we and what I said
we that includes the Conservancy
district know that we're gonna
have to make additional changes.
And so and so the Conservancy
districts because of the
uniqueness.
Of the middle Rio Grande
Conservancy district because the
uniqueness of the of the arch
Hurley Conservancy district.
we agreed will put the time
frame and and we'll come back
with the conforming amendments
later.
And so so they are coming into
the regular collection.
That is already in the office.
As of as of July one
twenty twenty three.
Of however having this in this
bill does the conforming
amendments to make it compatible
with the election code.
Because right now there are
elections are not compatible
with the election code if I
could finish these are.
They're not compatible with the
election code.
All so the these changes are the
product of years of conversation
with the Conservancy district.
All it is also
I.
What the subsidies of doing this
at this point is to allow them
the opportunity to do the
redistricting which all local
governments subject to
redistricting.
have to do redistricting if
there are the regular collection
in the year.
Following the receipt of the
results of the census so all of
these local governments from the
state are to be doing
redistricting.
And and and energy CD right now.
R. this different by county.
And and I will point out that
while it extends.
All over several counties what
that results in is a guarantee
right now that four out of the
seven will be from Bernalillo
county.
If they're able to redistricting
they actually will be able to do
a better job of being able to
protect historic communities of
interest be able to protect
farmers be able to protect the
American voices in the district.
What they cannot do right now.
So.
So it is this this is completely
relevant to this bill.
but also Mr chairman I'd like to
yield to the secretary of state
from of of I wonder if I could
respond to issues you raised Mr.
This is a question I think of
the tail wagging the dog I
understand that the U. elections
are the heart of democracy.
But the Conservancy district
should be able to make up its
own decisions about its its its
role who can vote in it
You know all of those things
which they have for forty five
fifty years.
And the fact that we make them
have their elections and certain
dates to conform with our
election code.
Shouldn't change the fact that
they are still responsible for
making their own decisions about
what they do and how they do it
and this just to stick something
in the changes the very way they
operate which I I I've been
approved agency severed is been
a critic of the two of the
redistricting does the
redistricting makes no sense but
they're not subject to the to
the of one man one vote to the
guidance that we have for our
redistricting that it's it's
it's a separate set up and and
and where I wanted them to
change it I don't think sticking
it into an election bill.
That will then force them to do
it whether they vote with their
board votes to do it or not is
going to be it is right I I just
don't think that's we we should
carry on business we if they
want to change it they should
vote to changes bring it to us
as a change and then we can
decide if this makes sense or
not and but the state well we we
want you to vote on these dates
and and and and these are the
people who can voting your
elections and then if that means
you have to change what this is
going to change the way they
appropriate money.
The right now it's a it's a two
hundred dollar a year assessment
on property taxes if you live in
the district and the district
goes half of my district is
entered in half of it is up
because if you climb up in the
heights for you and then is
that's outside of the district.
And it's all based on
irrigation.
And and it has nothing to do
with with the redistricting that
congressional redistricting this
is a separate issue for of some
very specific purpose and at and
I really
I mean for the third point is
says the no we don't want to do
it this way are we going to then
have to come back into they
should be in charge of making
the decision not not us on this
one I mean I because it's
different from all the other
elections that we do I've had my
say Mr chan thank you and the
center of the were you wanting
to comment from the secretary of
state who is with us he is the
best place.
Thank you Mr chair and Senator
Ivey Soto and I'll be brief but
I just I want to echo Senator
Ivey says those comments you
know from an administration
perspective and and I'm you
know.
Thank you very much my colleague
works over and who you know has
to manage these elections and
that was certainly may roll when
I was in the county clerk's
office there is just no way to
have the selection be part of
the regular local election and
not needing to manage how voters
are qualifying received ballots
and are able to participate
unless they are registered
voters in the district and Mr Mr
chair and in senators you know I
was on that task force that
Mr member and referenced we need
and and I did and so Senator is
so and we made I believe
thirteen recommendations to
reform introducing elections to
improve them to make a more
democratic at that time in
twenty ten only one of which was
adopted by the emergency ward at
that time and I do believe the
emergency board has really
embraced and and and I have seen
them sort of growth the
democracy at of that governments
of the Energy CD over time Mr
chair and and and centers but
you know this is the next step
to get us there we impacted
county clerks of imports
overtaking years going to
administering the selection she
these folks to be registered to
vote so that she can properly
insure that qualified folks are
getting in balance selection Mr
chair Senators last comment I
would make is that
thank you know Mr at Senator
Ortiz Y. Pino who was my state
senator for a long time for a
move to Santa Fe and who I
respect greatly mentioned about
renter's you know being able to
weigh in on this decision as
well we have literally thousands
hundreds of thousands of voters
across the state who are able to
vote in school board elections
and ito whose kids you know you
don't have kids in school right.
This is sort of just part and
parcel of of how we manage
elections and how we and how we
expand our democracy in this
country so with that Mr chair I
I can continue but they're just
significant administrative
implications this is not trying
to do the tail wagging the dog
but really just to further
democracy democratized all of
our elections especially are
smaller ones like emergencies
election and to improve the
election administration process
Mr chair Senators and and thank
you very much Mr Sanchez and for
giving me the opportunity thank
you so much for your comments
with further discussion on the
committee I go to senator Bob.
Thank you Mr chair and I really
appreciate the getting Mr
Thompson here and the speaking
on behalf of MRG CD and and
because it's important that we
know Mr chair foot to foot
factions and groups support
these bills and so that clarity
was was appreciated earlier we
heard we heard support from
other groups so one including
our PNM which was not true the
the they're not supportive there
is of one individual who does
not represent them that was
supportive and spoke to so I
want to be clear with that too
because it's important that we
know who's behind built into
supporting bills and so I wanted
to make that distinction and I
do a really a
and that was a terrific a
caption point made by Senator
Lopez with removing the
landowners I think that's a huge
issue just because you know you
you may not be a qualified
elector fuel landing you have
water rates invalid to county
I'll tell you what that's a
extremely important and you need
to be involved in in those types
of decisions so I appreciate the
comments from current Senator
Ortiz Y. Pino on this matter and
really that's all I have thank
you this representative center
to.
Thank you Mr chairman.
You know I I I see this language
in here.
I would want to keep this
language in here for the same
reason that I voted for Senator
Stewart and then meant to take
the other language out it's
because we have a
constitutionality issue the
language the Senator Stewart
took out was most likely
unconstitutional the language
and the way things are now with
it with the landowners of voting
is most likely unconstitutional
so apart from any of the policy
debate which and I appreciate
that discussion I understand the
concerns but apart from the
policy issues here.
Do we want to have.
Malls that are gonna meet
constitutional standards are not
and so for that at the shop and
so for that purpose I would
switch urged keeping this
language at.
Thank you senator do with
further discussion some of
course thank you Mister thank
you senator I guess my question
is I'm not that familiar with
the middle Rio Grande
Conservancy district on other
representative that area
but I am refer Miller with us
thank you us
were members of the state gives
property in Rio Arriba county
here district and so to me as a
white person I'm seeing more G.
C. as kind of a super Sadia and
and our state association you
have to have water rights and
land that I can imagine everyone
else who lives in lower San
Pedro voted was not part of this
sick emoting on whose
participating who are more
domo is our traders are
everything else so I think
that's a fair.
Sarah analogy that the this is
the the federal grant serves the
discus Basico sick SO shuzhen on
steroids so that's what I'm I'm
concerned about is for on if you
have any comments about that
from your perspective Mr chair
and I'm I'm here from the
farming community that the date
of that same issue that I'm my
perspective from we're really
counties thank you for that
seven this gentleman if I may
just local absolutely there's a
fundamental difference okay yeah
that's what I'm asking what
would my perspective is what
would be the be the difference
in your views are the
fundamental differences that and
and and raising the second as a
good comparison actually so and
executive only charges user
fees.
They don't do it at the lower
property taxation.
Emergency do address the
Conservancy districts do apple
or property taxation.
So so that every single property
within the benefit area whether
it's apartment property are not
pay taxes.
Every single property.
The well if it's if it's rented
out the owner of that property
the bigger than the flood
control aspect of it or what
what what's the difference they
that is what they do that is the
the powers that they have.
is in terms of property tax.
Authority under article eight
section of our state
constitution
is
a power that the Conservancy
district has had when we were
negotiating the regular local
elections of the local action
packed
and part of a conversation we
had with these Conservancy
districts when they said is
there any way you can leave us
out so we don't come at all.
My answer is yes give up
property taxation and what only
offer user fees.
And our answer was exactly you
know it's like oh no we want
that money okay you want that
money.
One I guess everybody gets to
vote.
Because that's how we do for
every single other public body.
And so and so and in fact the
example the schools is really
good exam people without
children vote on school tax.
People who don't own property
vote on school taxes.
Right and so and so.
It people who feel they've got a
great education people who feel
like that was our time so vote
on the school taxes.
And it's the exact same thing
here in terms of this district.
If they have property taxation
forty which they did.
If they don't want to give up
the property taxation authority.
Then then at that point the
voting needs to be done I
registered voters.
The
the other thing is.
That like I said there is there
is case law and I can find the
case law.
that in fact that was
collections where we only use we
New Mexico we only allowed you
to vote in a school bond
election if you could prove that
you pay your property taxes in
the previous year.
And the state Supreme Court
found that to be
unconstitutional.
And and not upon that up on that
that requiring.
Ownership of property was
unconstitutional to build a vote
in these elections.
Thank you for that first second
time I'm gonna be heading over
to senator Ortiz the people
followed by Senator Lopez
Senator Senator Pirtle I'm sorry
thank you Mr chair if you're
gonna make a motion I would just
like back but I was so all the
delay.
Thank you Mr president and Mr
chairman and senator of
assistance it is it section one
ten row we start talking about
the conservative district I
don't I don't know the numbers.
Yeah I mean if you want to make
that change it's a it's
I would ask that we be allowed
to vote on it and here and then
I would bring in the change to
the next committee yeah this is
that is that the section where
we would begin talking about
conservative talk about the
district I didn't know if that
was soil water improvement or
some other kind of no now all of
these are very hold of.
Statutes and and so if you're
talking about the more G. CD.
You're talking beginning at
section one thirteen of the bill
thank you one thirteen.
And
and that would go until I'll
tell you.
By the way you'll be with your
be breaking developments hard
for making this ammendment.
There is concern.
So go through section one
sixteen okay.
So Mr chairman I would move that
we delete sections one thirteen
one fourteen one fifteen.
And one sixteen of this act.
For this bill and and and the
points raised about Helen
constitutional it is to be
not allowing people to vote this
and let's say have property and
so on those are all pretty
important things but I don't
think they really should be
dealt with here we have we have
to take a separate vote if you
remember is before your time
probably a couple years I tried
to do away with the Conservancy
district because I thought it
was grossly unfair the way it
operated they've changed their
operation considerably since
then but it still is an anomaly
and it's still pretty much wiped
out all the acidic is in the
south valley they they had to
come begging for water from the
Conservancy district they have a
much better relationship now.
So there's some improvements
that need to be made in those
ways of of just changing how
they function but I really don't
think it belongs in an election
bills and and if if the Senator
Moores you the I I don't know
how you feel about it but it
just seems like it's it's
unnecessary.
Use of of this bill to do
something very different so I
would make that motion Mr
chairman.
Federal agents of the mice to me
that this is a fun friendly
amendment.
Well it is on friendly it's very
unfriendly however.
Turn it into side I'm very much
want to keep Senator Lopez and
Ortiz the payment Senator Baca
support of this bill.
And if this is going to be a do
or die in terms of their support
on this belt and despite how
unfriendly it is
I'm gonna say it's a compliment.
And that's the leading sections
one thirteen one fourteen one
fifty and one sixty seven of
wouldn't isn't it one seventeen
also no it's not that's a
difficult for Charlie and the
okay is up from there fully on
board very good any discussion
on the amendment senator Morris
I thank you thank you senator to
subpoena for that I just would
ask of of the who the
conservative district to get
stated policy position I think
we're gonna take this thing out
but I think they need to get on
this if we grow and we need
their input in the future.
Thank.
Whether discussion center where
I just Mr chair Senator I thank
you also amended title on page
three of the bill.
That could take a while to amend
this is.
Page
three of the file.

No okay well I know because of
the act nope okay Google that's
still fine.
So that nothing in the title
related to what we from the

specific to what he's proposing.
The correct.
Yes.
That's yeah that's our Charlie

amendment passes Senator Ivey

want to highlight this moment

moments for those people who
walk around saying oh we Ivey
Soto once everything the way he
wants it.
