House Bill Gates.
with
And we have one sponsor on that
bill if it's that I consisting
of the state before you present.
That they chose somebody who is
retiring from the house.
You're the house.
Not just.
you're you're read out make
friends or or not
in this bill but it was on yes.
And also let me just make it an
early announcement for.
That is an that we've been
having technical difficulties.
At the moment movies include the
ability to call microphones we
know that for those words I
always in front of us
Maybe working on may not be
working with you but that's why
I use in my outside voice yes I
am aware for months of the
month.
pandemic but it also
you may want to leave them a
little bit towards your
microphone and speaker other
technical difficulties were
having.
This is that we're not able to
connect in a public comments
from that are
we're not able to connect and
reloads.
helicopter.
this is however a bill from the
house.
my assumption is that there was
testimony to the house.
On this ago that is already
going to see.
and so for all persons who are
hoping to do.
Well public comment I do
apologize.
Of course these that we are
having
that that will ensure that
all we will say public comment
for those of our president have
well with that Representative.
If you will if you will not be
surprised as to.
presents possibilities
thank you Mr chairman and
members the committee I am
joined today by Michael sharp
with research and polling we
still for rich Olson who are the
legislature's lawyers so to the
extent you have a lot of
questions or technical questions
I will be turning it over to
them I do want to answer the
chairs question clearly drew the
short straw because I am a lame
duck I think it is because I
don't have a conflict going in
I I want to give you a short
synopsis of what this bill that
the house maps are based on and
what they're not based on.
So what are based on is is your
call that Senate bill three oh
four.
A bipartisan redistricting
committee.
act that the justice Travis
chaired.
The committee came back with
three house maps.
That we're
then value waited it per the
state per the statute.
By an independent expert.
professor contrail again all of
the house maps frankly all of
the maps and a in terms of
partisan fairness the committees
the committee was specifically
instructed not to look at
partisan demographic data and
that was reflected in the
expert's report so from the
house perspective and I I want
to be careful about not speaking
to the entire house but at least
from my perspective as the house
floor manager on this bill the
kind of charge was that we would
get away from the C. R. C. if
there was a compelling reason
justice Chavis and his committee
actually provided that
compelling reason because there
was not a tribal consensus
reached.
that is reflected on the three
maps that were sent to us and by
the way so that the committee
knows those maps for March but
not move to there in the public
record as house bill's three
four and five House Bill for
being the one we used the one
House Bill three and five for
the
where the.
committee's recommendations with
the pueblos consensys the all
pueblo council government but
the other was the committee's
consensus with the Navajo
nation's consensus we obviously
couldn't start with either one
of those maps in terms of trying
to build a consensus so we
started with the one which has
been affectionately refer to
expand pay map because that was
the one that didn't bias it
toward you to the pueblos or the
Navajo Nation justice Chavez.
The other hand then that's it
that's it that's it that's good
to have on the record Mr
chairman so the
so so what just to show this in
the committee said was that the
pueblos did the tribal interests
could not reach a consensus so
they basically directed us to
see if we could reach a
consensus so this process I have
to tell you took many months and
the
up the nineteen pueblos the it
Correa Mescalero Apaches and the
Navajo Nation
frankly through the the
mediation of our speaker
encourage them to come up with a
consensus that they then
presented to us and that was
overlaid on the one which it was
House Bill for the result of
which is the bill you have in
front of you house bill eight so
I do want explained to both
parties that in when it hit the
house floor.
and try to committee before it
is out for as it was working its
way through the legislative
process that we got and it was
clear from the house floor
debate we did get
individual members in both
parties wanting to change the
bills to kind of move precincts
around to help different members
for variety of reasons
because there was four of eight
that included an hour long
discussion an objection to our
plans by one of my part said
wanted to move things around
that we resisted then there was
also from the other party the
same kind of discussions we held
the line on.
And so what you're seeing in
front of you is the combination
of the committee the committee
because that I've been I've been
quite two hundred quite for
three hours which I think is a
record for me in the last
Committee process so
So what we did was combine those
two and then held the line and
that's what you have in front of
you you have the Committee the
CRC's recommendations are the
one with the overlay of the
tribal consensys and that's
what's been adopted by the house
I was I guess I will still if
you can hear it going to close
and then turn it over for
questions or from the committee
with a final comment and there
he just I want to make sure you
heard the final comment just to
set the tone for today's a
committee process you look very
lovely today Mr chairman and
with that I'll turn it back over
here.
Thank you very much
Representative Eli you look at
your mask.
I thank you out okay very well
thank you for up for that
position.
on the maps
That we of course goes to public
comments.
Of those four here that also
does the as a reminder.
we have a local these we're not
gonna be able to remove other
content.
Of the measure that
your mobile account at the.
R. all of the tables of the
house.
And then the office of is there
anybody in the world who would
like to speak
the number you are in favor or
against or for all for it is our
of these are.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Aaron eighty seven million.
This.
Representative.
That job order.
What else.
Thanks very out of.
Very well
Questions.
There are.
Thank you.
And if
each to section four of.
If it were done.
It also.
I mean the constitution maybe
the house.
Also build in.
Yes.
Actually but to me it would
appear what.
What we're done to delay
elsewhere statue with.
because Mr chairman Senator
because this is my first
redistricting I'm going to turn
that over to Mr still understand
this is not his first
redistricting and he might be
able to answer that question I'm
assuming Mister chairman Senator
it is because of some legal
concerns but honestly I don't
know some additional ministers.
Mr Chairman Senator Pirtle.
I have I apologize what was your
for your question whether
there's redundancy in this
section four of the of the
statue that it didn't have the
statute from the wood as for
your question.
Colleges this is verbatim out of
the.
So I I'm just wondering why we
have.
Statute.
Okay not that.
By the county processor.
The gentleman Senator Pirtle
I would have to say.
That it is not necessary to have
section for in the statute but
there but all right.
Just be the only because it is
language from the constitution
and vote assuming that to be the
case
I don't I don't think there is
any defect in the.
Statute by having that language
in the.
Mr chair I move we straight
section.
I actually not.
Senator we were up to that one
of these activities.
The.
I don't believe.
Copy that the.
The LFC.
On the issue.
Each year usually at.
That is that.
Yeah that will work for.
Full.
Your name maybe the questions
why does it seem to.
Zero.
If you look at the
Representative I updated the.
With.
in.
Later on the.
Not that are
being.
In order.
Sorry about
that and then there
Representative.
New.
We have that.
I was looking at the wrong bill
I hear that you sent to that is
on the.
That's my fault.
Yeah no it's not that I need
I suppose I should in the long.
Your okay right thank you.
That it's the same one of the
people out of a.
Thank.
Not this is not.
A little in the.
your all.
At about at the moment if you
look on the street.
And I and the number of.
And.
We.
I correction the.
this is what.
Realizable.
Of course of the work after I
waited the last.
I I are.
Representative for both
activities.
Job reference it will last.
This is affection are invalid.
That language
is is disenfranchised in.
well.
And so as a language that we.
that we have to replace.
and that is the of the
Representative.
The mass.
Well.
The more I remember.
I.
Whatever.
Not forgetting increases.
I.
For I just about reserving.
Investment are that increasing
equalize more than one.
Representative well
Representative district.
Recent map the firm and not
being complies with the
subsection.
Not be rejected by the secretary
of state.
And reserve the property for.
That for those.
So that is that is the program
language that that act of the.
Yeah.
That same language and I I it
may be a family member I just
want to ask Miss appears to be
in Senate bill two as well just
so you're aware of that I don't
have over.
And.
And actually conduct worth of
what we might be face at work
yeah I just I just last but not
I know that.
Representative.
The last in the easy that was
that was.
As of others
This leading the.
A lot of them all.
I think rational manner.
I'm sitting here fuzzy is is
headed to the governor has.
We want to I see what you mean
you've already changed sorry I
know right my heart stopped for
a minute I.
Okay yeah I I am it is office
and let me just get eight forty
we've got food we've Mr chairman
with all respect for you and
Dawn proposing the amendment
because I'd like to just run it
by Mr Olson and Mr Felder and
see if they're okay with us okay
just a minute.
Yeah
Recognizing that'll have to come
back to the house for
concurrence I get that it'll be
family and so that.
Well is there any factions of
the amendment to section I.
I right is this the subsection
be
the story line for the right up
for two.
And served in their
We reserve five reasons for the.
Senator that we see lasting more
than one Representative.
That increasing that.
I.
Representative a state
representative or state senator
those instances.
I
One.
Of the.
What about
Reviews there were times.
We were.
So the reason why we can't
transfer section is because of
section eight is essential to
this bill.
And I thought that was possible
problems the resources section
Hey and that and then the other
thing is is that there is that
difference between ease of the
paragraphs.
Is and act right would be that I
absolutely reek of all this
informal three.
Of the election code freezing.
is that it's
What the program access to
Russian district is one of the
state representative district
states that one of the state
Senate discrepancies you once as
Education Commission.
So so there is a.
Okay that is customized to each
one.
We're adopting the ultimate goal
is to.
These
are all just.
And
part of the lesson the.
But in the meantime let's
council by the
way and it also by Senator most
of that right.
This section altogether because
session date is.
Mr chairman if I could ask you
to try to take notes but it's
possible to read my writing if I
can get something even hand
right that I can take back to my
chambers so they can see that
sort of change recognizing we
have to deal with it please just
I I would like to be able to see
okay.
Is there any objection to it out
in the mail.
No objections that the
membership is not never heard
back.
Thank you Mr chair of.
After looking through I don't
find.
The.
The best.
That.
For
years the
For
on this year.
Later the next paragraph.
The.
The house.
Also.
Right now either.
The HSD.
The.
The end of.
The.
Representative.
Mr chairman members committee I
can't the Mr shelters already
answered this so long as it's
not inconsistent with the
constitution I just don't have
any problems with it so would be
fun friendly in terms of a
proposal I would like to see
this go back with all due
respect to my chamber with as
the changes as possible there's
a technical change that has to
be made hi I would agree with
that this is one that so long as
it's consistent with the
constitution I just don't see
the problem thank you Mr
chairman and I appreciate Center
appreciate your comments are
really do.
It would be able.
That is a of a.
This.
Right section four on page two
right.
The.
also right.
Eight people right.
session four full movies ready
to lines Sam Levin.
faced three lines two three and
four.
and
that and then we let our
existing session be.
Thank that is a the.
Of the.
All right.
Is there any further debate.
Very well do this all the rules
Senator yes.
A little bit
more yeah.
Yeah.
The.
that
for.
Forces.
that.
They're spending on the line
movie yeah.
But over the past right now at
the end of the for for the.
As well as of the.
Share this.
Correct and that is what will be
yeah.
I.
So late in the program.
For all.
Thank you Mr.
section.
For the.
All.
The.
Here are going I.
So basically the fourth general
election.
To celebrate.
As it was right.
Got it.
Okay.
Where site.
You walk us through more.
Your.
That.
Happy that all of the discussed
that I will save that money
which was in the other in our in
our maps so what happened was
ten years ago because there were
no lapses for.
And the judge through the maps.
And then and then
So that's why I make reference
to that I will also go.
That the description of the
districts within hi you will
there ever passed as a as a bill
there were compiled based upon
the judge's order.
On to aspect of the problem
would be I notice what would be
of what the differences are.
And I have a four K. or I and
that's part of what happened
with the.
The legislature yes definitely.
Also the reason why there is a
discussion about about making
large changes the media is the
that we have a member of a very
I like to move that number yes
Representative we cannot do that
because we're not we will not be
modified the legislative.
The.
I just districts are built
researcher or built actually
notices.
Yes so it is true that speed
right off as a speaker all of
our bill.
We do that through the state for
your friends or you could use
another reference yes.
Mr
Forms.
Senator I Senator I'm sorry I
missed it I was trying to just
talk about this.
Thank god what what this does in
fact.
Your documents
Act refers to other speakers.
Zero to Mr Boller does not
appear in favor or against.
Yeah what you're about to.
Also for by the way as a member
of the advisory.
And this.
Mr chair members of the
committee I'm here simply for
technical.
Guidance the what the bill does
and I'm either for or against
this legislation I assume the
question on the subject to the
of for FY that language in there
that languages in there because
ten years ago and twenty years
ago according to the districts
and what's in the what's in the
the statutes right now is
actually from nineteen ninety
two and so in the in the in the
compilation you have.
It is basically the court orders
from those from from two
thousand one two thousand eleven
and this just.
This.
Clarifies in the compilation
what happened back there.
So that what you're putting into
bill what's what this bill does
is.
Do not become.
Give guidance to the reader
allow you to see what the
current law is.
The current law would you do if
you an act this.
Would describe.
What.
What the what the law is and I
think I can say it now that I
understand Mr Boller
sexploitation brings the reader
up to.
So if somebody just reading at
their non lawyer and they want
to know the history where we at
freezing right of today helpful
to refer to the correct and yet
Mr chair of a members of the
committee so this tells you
where when this takes effect
and.
We're you collect your
representatives from on and
after video starting with the
general election two thousand
two that's standard language you
want to know when these take
effect they're going to take
effect for the election of two
thousand twenty two in the
Senate it would be two thousand
twenty four.
And you need to indicate.
What are the districts for the
next upcoming election one of
the precincts you used for the
current redistricting.
Because you know all right now.
It's from two thousand eleven
the precincts as they were there
those have changed because of an
update at this twenty one
hundred of them ten years ago
there was fifteen.
So that is what this this
section basically subsection
the.
So.
So they have the.
So.
so the person to live in the
district Representative Eli.
Elected to.
Senator.
Correct so if you appointed so
if Representative resigns today
or or.
June or whatever.
Ointment to fill that vacancy
would be from the old district.
And that person would serve the
remainder of an unexpired term
in other words until next.
January first twenty twenty
three basically.
And the new.
And that the lecture but the
election would be for the
district as is laid out in this
bill so this is basically
clarifying so you so you dress
exactly what your point is.
Where is the where is the
appointment.
Come from the come from the old
district because you're serving
out the remainder of a an
existing district existing
Representative.
And and Mr chairman to center
for rules point I do think that
in.
That you would range earlier
which was legitimate it's giving
the reader kind of a factual
background they don't have to go
hunting everywhere to find out
what's really going on so you've
got to get both the legal
principles the constitutional
principles in the history that
leads up to where we are today
it's it's just helpful to me.
There
are several.
Of of.
That.
Late.
That.
And we also.
Mr chair Senator.
Representative so what happens
when the court does it
court ordered is I mean that's
not a statutes not session loss
of in the compilation is
compiles all the specials would
you you all actually passes
seven by the governor and that's
that's that's conveniently put
in one place the compilation
well if the court order
something in the in the in the
case of ten years ago twenty
years ago they ordered that.
The districts are.
These zero three six zero
district one district to this
through these of the precincts
and as a convenience the
compilation commission put that
in the you know that complex so
you knew what your districts
were with precincts districts
but that's not a special it's
not something you really can and
then so to speak of course
directly touch
you have to do with statute.
And but that's what you're doing
now this is considering it a
statute or considering a bill to
create a new statute to say
these within the district that
will be compiled and so to to
avoid confusion again choose to
the compilation commission
please take old numbers out and
and they replace that with.
The new the new the new law
first of all I think are very of
the the former signed.
Yes all of these.
Make a
will ever have removed.
Of the.
What's the issue.
Well that's why in the previous
section we just discussed Mr
chair
it says that's where.
That's where you make the
appointment from is the old
district so it has to be in both
places one place it's an
instruction to we're going to be
a pointed from the old district
the new one that the final in
the last part here the country
provisions of state and you can
remove that old district
everybody knows what that is
it's on the books I don't think
there's any confusion about that
but if they needed to that would
be it would still be the
annotations.
That's all based in the
historical and I think yes okay
yes so I yes so it and that's a
good point Mr chair so every.
Accomplishing other we we put it
all online you can go back to
the nineteen eighties as far as
I go to see the exactly what the
law was for that particular year
for a particular session
so that will be there
And you can you can find.
Well.
So Mr chair and representative
help me understand so if it
hadn't been on.
Asked if they were at.
The old maps for two years was
in the late implementation on
the districts how did they do
with it because I think the
concern I have is you could
essentially a lot of work done
to at least on the house with
insurers at the work of the two
district what what could happen
with the vacancy somebody could
end up in the old district
within here to get somebody to
the.
Yeah.
so I just wanted.
That my mind around of why would
we just build a new map.
Now people are under
represented.
Mr chair Senator.
I think the ink that.
Laying it out this way makes a
certain sect because.
You were elected or or or in
this case Representative was
elected to serve two year terms
and that term in that office in
that Representative that
districts existing that for the
last two years so to speak right
and.
So in that sense you're you're
not being appointed to the new
district because the old
district doesn't end until a
replacement.
Is elected.
And that's going to be in that
election.
Is from the new district if that
occurs in November.
And the ticket office on January
first or January twenty fourth.
We actually for.
Their election so if you didn't
do that it would be confusing
because then you could appoint
somebody from the new district
but what term are they they
serve their serving.
For it a district does not yet
exist and your including the
whole district which hasn't
actually doesn't change until
officially until January first
of next year of two thousand in
this case two thousand twenty
three.
So it it it is especially for
the Senate because this year and
as it was twenty years ago where
the Senate doesn't get elected
until two thousand twenty four
and so you you definitely don't
want to.
So to speak cut that persons for
those people that elected that
person to that district of their
term by two years or three
years.
So so Mister chair
If this is not the statute last
line there would be more likely
to look differently.
There would be similar language
to this.
Yes Mr chair Senator so in that
in that the section five or for
whatever it would state set of
siding to the to the case law or
the case which established those
districts it would site to the
statute as that of the previous
provided the ten years before it
passed it would and it's a lot
simpler because it's actually
all done by statute but when the
court intervenes it does create
problems as far as the record
goes in trying to address that I
mean it's not usual that we cite
case law or court decisions in a
in the statute but in this case
we have to do that.
So this is actually going back
to the Senate map so even though
Senator Sanchez was the only
Senator drawn into somebody
else's district will still
serve.
Yes it is.
Mr chair Senator exactly and if
somebody if you were to resign
for instance an appointment
would be to fill that vacancy
for that district that was drawn
up by the court ten years ago.
Until until the election two
thousand twenty.
Here are there any house
members.
Yes
Energy's being paired up network
and.
There.
Hi I'm I'm paired with a public
over and
Representative Hochman Vigil is
being paired with the right.
I think the help I've covered.
Representative else that they're
not going into the on the.
The.
Mr chairman and I think I I
don't know I can't speak to
Representative Anderson and I
and certainly not to either
Representative.
I am the Hillary.
Or.
Register.
Well.
Representative.
And and I think Mr chairman and
senator Sarah I I've heard that
same spot in effect information
on Representative Hochman Vigil
she's moving but I don't know
services that I don't know that
is a fact I just don't I can't
say that.
The shares actually no.
House maps are hearing anybody
and it's been made clear by the
by a certain number of of the
house and by.
For that are Senate maps.
is that we came up with the.
Through the committee process
which yesterday was upheld by an
overwhelming margin that you
know we want to honor.
The process and what the out of
the Senate.
There were there was of clear
that.
Pass that over that somehow.
I understand this body as was
made clear yesterday by chair of
the issue that intends to
support what he's done.
Many years and we don't metal
and each other sandbox.
And I think it's it's very
starting to me that we're going
to allow other.
House the lower house.
Make threats and and try to
basically metal in our business
as the Senate.
whenever actually what could
happen with the the order that's
that's what we're creative we're
going to.
you're on the floor.
More.
Senators we had a solution that
was a wind and for everybody
involved that
held much full as could possibly
be.
Sure that there is a
continuation of of leadership
within all the district funding.
so I I think it's disappointing
that that this review.
Here that you know the Senate's
going to that the house and the
house businesses would be at the
Senate is going.
basically.
Thank you
actually you raise a reserve.
Correct of the members well if
you're
But prostitution.
The part of your we.
I'm looking at this point three
is false.
subsection the.
Yes Representative the proposed
up no more.
The numbers of elector.
Districts.
So office Senator.
On page one.
One twenty two.
That's.
This is an.
This is reported that the house
Representative as opposed to
seventy members
seven members discussed uses
more than seventy.
Hi and I supposed to be with our
legislative rocketed to is up to
the number that is less than
seven.
The older than twenty one.
As long as all of our rural.
So that more than percent.
Otherwise so so Mr chair are you
suggesting strikes a of section.
I mean we can choose the session
right all of these areas.
I.
Well yeah.
I also have a background of
finances or.
with with the fact that the
added benefit of already being
referred by the incorrect.
So
Just a yeah.
For some of the.
They are all case of one of the
pleasure of the.
Yeah.
Senator Wirth.
The white shoes.
As of the twenty seven is budget
for.
Question that is.
I just.
I.
Percentages.
Yes.
Senator so far from your all
that.
ready for.
Population.
Back population thank you for.
Forty eight percent.
Census for.
For for this.
For this morning.
The rating.
Mr chair Senator Moores on.
The.
So the question is why is the
percent of Hispanic district
less than percent of spending in
the state.
The answer would be the
distribution of the state
population within the state some
places very concentrated and
because of that you mind up with
districts that are seventy five
percent eighty percent to
Spanish and makes it a challenge
to if you wanted to get up to
say forty four percent the
districts being Hispanic might
have to divide up city's
Hispanic communities and to
other districts Peter apps
combine spend a commitment to
not expand neighborhoods in
order to do so C. million might
end up cracking some of the
Hispanic areas into districts
that you otherwise might not
when you're trying to create
some of these other districts.
Or.
Vendors or.
That is
Representative Masser.
the.
The Germans and.
For us okay
the short answer is is most
these districts were drawn.
By the CRC.
And with the exception of the
northwest sector wherein you
reference a deviation but I
don't think that's the subject
matter you're talking about the
fact is is that that is why.
We were very careful in Senate
bill three oh four I believe
that your help sponsor or did
she.
To have not just the
committee be bipartisan make up
but also to have on that day and
independent analysis done to
make sure that there weren't
issues like packing or cracking.
And what you have heard.
spent on chairman Senator from
both issues review the CRC
report in its entirety and from
listing Mr sharp is there was
nothing done like that there was
no nefarious motive frankly I
have to tell you you would have
to attack either this year she
findings for the tribal
consensus in as I've told many
members have that.
I think that the house maps
we're done.
Very judiciously to make sure
that we followed something
frankly was historic that we set
up something where citizens were
involved in testifying before
the C. R. C. there were over
eight hundred citizens yes fine
thousands of people watch that
twenty three hearings around the
state.
And then they were reviewed by
professor contract.
And then I tribal consensus was
reached not by us but by the
tribe's so if you're suggesting
that somehow there were no
serious motives I would Mr
chairman and senator with all
due respect strongly pushed back
on that notion and say you pick
what you're gonna attack you to
the CRC for the tribal
conditions but it ain't us and
we did it fairly and
appropriately thank you Mr
chairman Senator Sanchez.
It is not a C. or C. Matt see we
did the house of representatives
doing up and down vote on the C.
R. C. Matt you Mr chairman and
senator this was debate we had
on the house floor I think what
you're referring to is is that
the there was a center for civic
values or something like that
the submitted the map initially
I can tell you and we had
testimony on the house floor
that from one of the
commissioners to the committee
commissioner Curtis that talked
about how they didn't just
rubber stamp entities they
continue to have a committee
they continue to have
discussions both among the
committee and the public and
then they voted on and then
following that without any
partisan data that the committee
had to work with the approved
the map after much discussion
but then we had an independent
expert to determine whether it
Matt partisan fairness and
frankly Mr chairman and senator
again with all due respect our
maps all veterinary and that
wasn't true for example in Texas
where they got between sis dis
and apps and services out of
this the map or looking at is
not a C. or C. the maps that you
might have started with my to
Sears.
Then I started with was reviewed
by Representative or professor
control.
You all got a mass amounts
representatives and started the
political process and change
that.
As this map as drawn been
reviewed by professor project.
Mr chairman and senator
responded both your points the
short answer to the latter
question is no because what we
did was was we asked for user
tribal concerns and the answer
was after much discussion a long
discussion both most mostly
affecting the northwest sector
not the Hispanic districts that
you're talking about and the
answer was we have reached a
consensus and as I stated
Mr chairman and senator at the
beginning of this discussion the
C. R. C. map then what just
house bill four which is in the
record
and is available to the public
we overlaid the tribal consensus
and so that's why state you're
either going to say that the
tribal consensus was wrong and
we should have till the
nineteenth pueblos and the
Mescaleros and Apaches and the
Navajo Nation that they were
wrong for this year she was
wrong because it's a combination
of those two things that's what
it is Mr chair representative
use that very back row of.
Sentences to roll back both on
their maps hello this is Gerry
was for representative from
eight years and this is your C.
map as a group I just going for
all when it has not.
CRC process was followed.
we do not
You Mr chair representative
Garcia was awful.
those other maps.
Senator media section Russian
map also there were voted on by
the entire.
But.
Partisan offices over the
revenue.
So come in and say on anyone.
Your maps.
We did not have the bottom again
we are legislation.
And not taking any of the maps
you members.
So this is not just the State
Capitol
Leave it here.
Matt wrong bipartisan all.
for leverage.
For comparison all.
Representative back to the point
that on our side of us right now
know but if an opportunity here.
No it was on your last on.
Not a change process thank you
for all.
On.
Zero six I promise the programs
are procedures uniformed I
apologize but we got the house
members over here
with that is.
After change process because
this is Garcia Garcia about the
house and Mona Services.
Senate Bill.
We went through all that
exercise going from side.
Also.
More I am also.
Yes that would be the latest
person your muscle.
That's going away presents on
that so.
Mr chairman if I could just
respond because I do think it's
important the members know what
the process was very very short
we did fall this year she
process because this year she
specifically said.
We need the legislature this was
their direction to us we need
the legislature to help reach a
tribal consensus and work on
that they couldn't and their
work was done so the idea that
we would do that and then go
back they're finished that was
our charge to them they told us
what to do and we follow so the
idea that we get all of the
CRC's process is false we get
and with respect to Hispanic
districts I want to point out I
want to make sure I had the
information right the data
actually support twenty four H.
B. A. P. majority districts
eight house bill eight has
twenty seven H. B. A. P.
majority districts so the idea
that we have somehow been
discriminatory towards Hispanics
as a completely false attack and
I just can't say it is a nice
way chair after you're saying
twenty four Hispanic districts
and states like New Mexico
vision I I will not accept.
Because of that.
Have that conversation many
minutes on twenty seventh is not
enough this is franchises.
I.
That are doing well.
Yeah.
For all the.
Asked on
based on that factor Senator
Lopez center one.
Thank you Mr chair not senator
Morris kind of got into what I
was going to talk about here
Mister chair I think it's we we
were close to the twenty four
districts is.
Representative a state of almost
a million status active the fact
this is the structures that
Hispanics are being forgotten in
this shell game that we're doing
what we're trading one Roberson
for number
that's how I do.
C. R. C. C. process was awful
wasn't followed because this is
not a CRC Matt so what happened
please.
We got the CRC maps the side
life that we didn't think we had
certain people come in and put
certain about the pressures of
people that are here so that we
could change the maps to
whatever suited now Cremins can
read its case right and those
agreements presented this is one
of those of you we can
we can see on this that came out
of the houses and you know
there's a lot of people that
aren't happy with the.
Status.
And that in my opinion Mr chair
that's just.
And I think the.
This was a.
Most.
There.
The first.
That.
Your static population the white
because they're not organized.
Your.
Rally against this kind of stuff
is a lot of the medical this
some of our that's the real
truth.
Our.

the.
Madam.
Senator Moores that that's not
what we need food and beverages
for.
To make a decision.

The demographics of the state of
