substitute.
One is
in the Lincoln County area there
were a couple of
With the resort Thomas okay
Thomas kind of thank you Russell
area there was a patient there
was a school district that was
divided.
And and so they did a committee
sub in order to
draw the map so that that school
district would not be divided.
And then the reason for the for
our OB and and that was offered
by Representative Nibert.
The reason for the flash mob was
because Bloomfield Aztec and
Farmington we're not all in the
same.
A district I they were there was
a division between district I
and district ten.
And Bloomfield Aztec and
Farmington tend to operate
together.
So that was offered by
Representative Lane.
on the floor of the of the state
house in order to keep those
three districts together you can
see there are they they actually
go with the rest of district ten
not with district I because of
the of the deviations on it
would not have worked otherwise
but still there maintain
together.
And so on so that's that's why
the two floor subs took place
but otherwise
this is.
the answer the question if you
were to divide New Mexico by ten
how would you do it.
And
And so as we can see by the map
we have district one if you will
find district one for us is
coming at us.
Which isn't in the metro area.
So that is largely a west side
district that.
Includes up Mason all souls will

chairman and the Mr chairman
thank you
At first I just want to express
my shock.
That.
Changes were made by the house.
To a the redistricting
commission suggested met.
because we've been told that the
house was taking a hands off
approach to all those map so I
am glad to see that we're not
the only ones have taken some
liberties with maps suggested by
the commission.
first the second the message
also that you refer to is
actually still in it's it's it's
don't tell Senator Padilla is is
of he's in and then
Right trouble introduce in sixty
it it's a six along with the
lead of the south valley so the
Albuquerque really has basically
for.
We have four for members on the
which is you know.
We've got one part of
Albuquerque's in one part of it
is in three parts of its in two
part of its and six.
Yes well the property is going
to have to members of Congress
it should at least have three
point two members of the family
met three members of Congress
are you know Senator Pirtle
And last question.
Are we okay with the part I
don't see anything about the
population.
Deviation are probably okay on
that that.
We can get up to the that that
little sheet that usually
accompanies is okay.
Yes they are our strategy yes I
realize that we don't have that
what's up there.
So there is and all of these are
within plus or minus five
percent.
and so.
Even with the changes that were
made
we maintained a plus or minus
five percent.
with regard to all of those
districts.
And then the
In addition to that I will I
will point out that the you'll
see on district five the native
American population is fifty six
point nine.
that actually increased slightly
with the house floor amendment
of with unifying.
Aztec Bloomfield and
And Farmington in the same but
even after that it's still
within the population that it is
yes that's exactly right yes yes
I can that's right okay as long
as that's why that's the case
then I guess and you also know
that there are several districts
that are actually quite
competitive.
From a political perspective.
a district to is a is a very
effectively fifty fifty district
four is fifty fifty district
five the fifty fifty effectively
as is district six.
so they've they've they've
achieved a fair amount of of all
of our political competition
through these maps as well well
madam chairman just one comment
about that it that may be
helpful I'm not sure because
it's hard to get people to even
run for these positions yes and
I will I will note that in the.
In the Alexion bill that will be
heard in the opening Thursday
session one of the proposals
particularly if we can get it
done at the at the early part of
the session with an emergency
clause is that the PVC
candidates
only need to get one third of
the number of signatures
everybody else needs to get
given the size of their
districts.
and the return on investment for
serving up that seemed
appropriate.
Thank you thank you for that
suggestion to think yes.
Thank you any other committee
members.
Table the committee some of the
best.
Exactly Senator be to to look at
the second okay we have a motion
for do pass in the second.
do we need to call the roll Mr
Senator Ortiz Y. Pino yes.
Yeah Senator Stewart.
Senator Wirth yes Senator I.
Yes ma'am yes yeah.
