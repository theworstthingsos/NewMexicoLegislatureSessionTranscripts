number although with our.
Because she.
Check it out thanks most people
working.
The whole roof speakers you will
be there for the back ones are
working on.
Yeah this.
Mr Chairman.
Yes Mr Chairman yes.
I just wanted to inform you also
that
The.
Board member and Murray is up on
a plane to order again for
medical reasons and she will be
here today either just to make
sure your you knew that that the
it was unavoidable we have two
people than and Marie and Chris
to ring.
Correct well it could be three
if you we include Dorsey pokes
adult date okay very good that
will and I will follow up with
them later and get them through.
Thank you Mr chairman I can't
tell you how much I appreciate
all your effort to get us a well
All it's it's becoming more
after that we intended but yes
we're happy to do this and and
and and get this done.
It's important particularly with
the parole board.
To as well several of these the
base of people confirmed.
Yes Mr chairman but you know
it's out of your hands what's
happening with COVID out of
everybody state and pretty much
the.
Yes.
So what what a difference a.
Seven decades make that when we
had the polio vaccine within
months we had a hundred percent
of our country vaccinated and
now we're struggling to get as
few as we have.
Yeah it be nice if we learned
from the successes of the past.
So Mister chair would you be
running these appointments
through the first week of the
session.
We will do that as the floor
leader has time okay thank you
thank you brought this up.
Act.
Go again basically I can hear
you but yes I can okay Mister
chair up for the benefit of our
members have you heard yet from
chair of a floor leader worth
when you're expecting to have
confirmations I've told them
that confirmations on the floor
they don't have to be present
for but if they did want to come
and be honored by the Senate I
was just wondering if you had a
prospective date on that so the
yeah the majority floor leader
was here in the meeting he is is
that a step away to a to a quick
call with the governor he'll be
back a little bit my
understanding is that so we will
be actually we're we're gonna be
to the hearings this week we're
gonna vote on everybody the
first week of the session in
committee and then and then the
majority floor leader is going
to
is going to
schedule the confirmations
throughout the time of the
session in terms of the floor
sessions and so we'll see if if
we can if we can coordinate
certain of those some of those
we'll be doing as time allows in
others we may be able to
coordinate a certain day for
that.
Thank you Mr chairman I again I
reiterated to my members that up
that during the session things
are so tight that it's very hard
to know for sure the exact time
and date of any confirmation or
any hearing for any bill that
you're dependent on so many
moving parts but I appreciate
your efforts and the more
notice you can give of course
the better because as you know
my members are all volunteers
and also
I apologize to my members I
thought you might vote on there
are have the committee vote on
their nomination today so I will
let all the members know when
you do vote and it's my
understanding you will not need
them present next week again in
front of the committee when the
committee vote okay thank you Mr
chair act and and and it is true
it's tough to tell the exact
time even if you know the day
that something will happen
during the session frankly when
we have a special meeting during
the interim apparently it's
tough to tell the exact time
when something will happen.
Yes Mr chair it's a double edged
sword because some most people
have no understanding of how
hard legislators work and the
the constitutional constraints
under which they work and so.
Timing of course is everything
but scheduling is virtually
impossible.
Yeah it's it's difficult to
explain to people in a way that
they can actually understand
what happened.
But I can't tell you how much I
appreciate your taking us first
I know this is a little hiccup
here but
I ate I can only imagine how bad
it's going to be when you get to
Committee number membership
number twenty one for
confirmation.
Yeah it's so I'll just tell the
the committee members.
That first of all I'm I mean
I'll just I'll just tell the the
country's the parole board
conferees first of all again we
thank you for being here we
thank you for your patience.
And
that this is being delayed I
will let you know that while the
timing of getting going is being
delayed I will guarantee you we
will break for lunch on time.
So the ultimate result is that
we will probably be briefer with
our questions.
Then Mr chairman if you wanted
delay this a a confirmation
starting till about eleven
fifteen I think we'd all be in.
Indeed.
Right.
So we're we're.
The speakers in the back.
Senator you have the you send
that email Act Amy upstairs in
the north the rising level of
your bills.
Police.
Disabilities is territory there.
Sure I just do that for a.
Right the budget related.
My
great pleasure.
I would like to have somebody.
I.
At.
Well this.
Yeah.
Hallway.
The work that.
Here that.
Representative.
Senator.
Have a.
We have.
Okay Cisco can you say something
the employers.
Yes can you hear me now.
So yeah we get it we can hear
from the rear we're trying to
get you to the front of the room
The Cisco is it possible for you
just to keep talking for a
little bit.
Okay.
This is the first time I've ever
been asked to do that by a
committee chair but the yeah I
can continue to talk.
All of.
It is.
But if you thought you okay okay
here I go how's that.
Talking testing one two three
four five six seven.
Okay thank you very much
appreciate it although I am
noting that number get a little
bit of echo when we speak here
in the front.
So we're going to try to deal
with the eco issue I'm gonna do
my best to speak for a little
bit without actually saying
anything substantive is.
I know it's it's something that
I didn't really know how to do
in order to get a state senator
and and then it became a just to
happen to just be able to
continue to speak and not
actually say anything of any
kind of meaningful substance
whatsoever while I'm talking and
continually go through and do
that.
So.
is going up yeah the home is
that it is the home is gone the
bad news is the this move up and
so
you know again part of it is we
would have to have the back ones
so loud if we accept the
problems working because they're
still not working but that's
okay.
for the moment as long as we're
able to have it work without too
much of a continuous feedback
loop going on.
Cisco how are you hearing me.
I'm not getting any feedback
from you at all.
So I want to.
Expected.
Everybody faces blurred because
the the cameras pulled into a
Panasonic.
But
you know.
I can see that the entire
committee this way.
Yeah I think when I was in the
Senate the rule was you have
five minutes to substance within
half an hour debate.
The.
The.
That only that awful.
And.
Right now.
We are going to go ahead and
begin this morning I want to
think again everybody for your.
for your patience.
And
and so once again let me just
let everybody know
and private this us with you to
be to the session so we're gonna
be doing hearings
this week on a variety of
executive appointments as we do
these hearings if the sponsors
are present we will of the
Sanchez make a short
presentation if the sponsors are
not present that's fine that
will be more important when we
go to the floor
we will we will conduct a
hearing on each of these boards
of as much as possible we've
been working with the governor's
office to do hold boards as much
as we can so we do it more
thematically and and then what
will happen is we will do the
hearings and then and and
process all of those and then at
the beginning of the legislative
session in the rules committee
we will then take a series of
votes on all the various
different conferees look at the
committee reports done at that
time.
And
And then and then those will be
scheduled on the floor up
throughout the legislative
session
so that so that will pick up a
few probably everyday of doing
some of those so having said
that then we have the
Adult parole board before us
today I don't want to thank you
first of all I want to thank you
all very much for your
willingness to serve.
the people that I have as listed
as being present today for
confirmation hearings are
running loose Federal.
Raymond Santa
Ana get realize federal.
Janet Chandler.
Robert Kinney.
Amy Lopes's.
I would I'm and I up.
And merry how do you about us.
so those are the people that I
have for this panel.
In the hearings and so let me
first.
Yield to Senator Stefanics who
has been sitting here
exceedingly patiently.
who is the sponsor of right and
center.
for her to go ahead and give a
brief presentation about Mr
Santa and then what we're gonna
do.
and then also the senator Wirth
week is back from his meeting
with uh Senator are with the
governor we'll make a couple
comments about other women I up
and then what we're gonna do
exes we're gonna allow each of
you to introduce ourselves to
the committee.
and then after each of you have
introduced yourself to the
committee I'm gonna yell to the
executive director of the bill
parole board to kind of give us
an orientation in terms of of
kind of where things are with
the parole board in general and
the functioning
of the parole board and then at
that point then we will ask
questions of the various
countries some of them of the
general questions some of them
will be to specific members
or and some of them will be if
anybody can answer sort of thing
and so with that us Senator
Stefanics we we make motions
today will not to do the most
stable do that at the beginning
of the session.
Yeah so today is just simply the
the the the hearing with the
conferees Senator FedEx thank

being considered for
reappointment and he has had
many years and public safety and

the state of New Mexico and I'd
like to thank Raymond Floyd

this position thank you Mr chair
thank you very much.
Thank you very much and also let
me just remind members when you
speak to make sure that you turn
on your microphone.
And when you're not speaking to
make sure you turn off your
microphone
because I have learned over the
years how sensitive these
microphones are in and the
consequences that they pick up
so
but let me then we're going to
go to start with Mr Sanneh if
you'd like to introduce yourself
to the committee and tell us a
little bit about yourself
relevant to the work on the
parole board as well as when you
started serving and then what's

orders right now as well as the
challenges that you have I think
what you build to go at.
Thank you very much Mr chairman

also want to thank the senators
running for the US response for
this so for this morning really
appreciated that thank you very

reference point send this up one

there graduated from college
Santa Fe in nineteen ninety
seven although the degree and
political science at the time it
was the Christian brothers both
of us to help others that we're
actually in charge of the
college's Center baseball I had
a.
Very disciplined and I really
appreciated that well
opportunity B. L..
Them I've been married for
nineteen years all I have to do
with my wife for thirty six
years we have a twenty three
year old son graduated from St
Michael's high school and he is
currently getting his masters in
economics and statistics at UNM
I did retire in the two thousand
and seventeen my experience
there was I was in charge of
special programs are it was I.
S. B. which is referred to as
intensive supervision program
which is a program for
individuals that are very high
risk and maybe having a
difficulty provided by the
conditions of their parole

just wanna outlined that.
Gone is that I have worked

absolute Mississippi necessity
for incarceration and they're
being all balance of
rehabilitation and I think that

maintain that balance because

released to the community we are

continue with my knowledge and I
have been.
On the proboards now for about
two years and I thoroughly enjoy
it I continue to like to work
with people and encourage them
so that when they are released
that they can be successful.

Amy looks.
Good morning Mr chair members of
the committee my name is Amy
Lopez and I am from a small
village three miles south of
requests Santa Fe New Mexico
love where I live you know the
the culture and everything I was
raised in grants New Mexico I
started with corrections in
nineteen eight nineteen eighty
eight at western New Mexico
correctional facility and it's
only been belts I think about
four years when I started there
ended my career with probation
and parole after like twenty six
and twenty six and a half years
throughout my re my career I
worked at corrections at records
interpreting judgments sentences
insuring that people were
legally committed to the
department of corrections I then
went to be a case manager to
assist people with all plans
good time everything all the
duties at Intel as a case
manager in a correctional
facility I then in the meantime
obtained my degree I went over
to probation and parole I was a
probation parole officer in the
community that I was raised and
hopes to help people
you know with with issues that
they have went over and was a
corrections administrative for
short time then I went back to
the patients and parole as a
region one hearing officer which
includes conducting preliminary
hearings on inmates or or
clients that potentially
violated their conditions of
parole prior to them seeing The
New Mexico about twelve or
Act as one of my colleagues did
say it was one of my passions to
serve on the New Mexico without
parole board to continue serving
the state of New Mexico and just
as a.
And to try to help people you
know influence or or you know
suggested them changing
behaviors and I appreciate you
listening to me this morning and
thank you for allowing me to
speak and serves
the state of New Mexico.
Thank you very much but I'm and
I I.
Mr chairman honorable members of
the committee thank you very
much for allowing us to be in
front of you this morning we
really do appreciate this
opportunity a quick snapshot of
myself on the tall side graduate
attended New Mexico State
University I began my law
enforcement career with
southwest part way back in the
early nineties.
Transferred that to the Santa Fe
police department in nineteen
ninety seven where I completed
the remainder of my career and
retired in twenty fourteen I
would request a rose all the way
to the rank of the deputy chief
of police.
During this time of course ít
graduates to Mexico Law
Enforcement Academy hold
certifications in first line
supervisor as well as executive
management for the.
Northwestern University.
Following my retirement I was
retired for approximately one
week before I begin my second
career with the New Mexico adult
proboards in two thousand
fourteen I've been a member all
this time and last year I
believe it was March of twenty
twenty when the governor
appointed me to the interim
chair of the parole board.
It's been an honor to serve the
state of New Mexico in my entire
adult life and I want to
continue that probably the
biggest thing that I can say we
have accomplished since I was
the interim chair and as we
change the new rule regarding
useful service to full fenders
those are juvenile sentences
adults to life.
We change the rule to mimic that
which was mandated by the United
States Supreme Court it was
quite the process but I'm very
proud of what we have done and
enacted something that is so
very beneficial to the state of
New Mexico.
Thank you so very much and about
a year Sanchez are worth is just
right and and after we hear from
very I don't know but I think it
was a few words about two as
well merry how do we want to.
Okay.
Morning.
Mr Chairman.
Members of the committee my name
is merry how do we across the
and I am from.
I live currently in grants New
Mexico and.
I was I was raised in Santo
Domingo pueblo and then I from
there I went on to school in Los
crucis I have a bachelor's in
criminal justice and sociology I
after graduating from college I
will and.
On to
to work in Cibola County out
that's when about when they were
going to just open western New
Mexico correctional facility at
that time they needed a full
time probation parole officer
because we were sharing one from
I went to a county so they hired
me full time and I.
Became a supervisor in that
community.
I have experience working with
the tribal governments in the
area do need field calls as well
as
Just.
Assisting people and their
parole supervision and crawling
out to the area to the rural
areas.
The needs and requirements a
little bit different in the
because of the resources
available so you have to be a
little
creative.
In small communities
I stayed with corrections.
And I retired in twenty twenty
five years after that I was
retired for about six months in
two thousand.
Ten I I was became an alternate
municipal judge for the city of
requests and I was doing that I
up until now in December for
eleven years I also substitute
at the with the grant Cibola
County school systems whenever
they need a substitute
And I am currently I'm on the
board for the more first place
which is the shelter for for
domestic violence victims.
My goal is the proboards as
several people stated that this
was one of my.
I would like to do on my but it
lessens these that that it would
be the a continuation for my
career
so I would like to as a parole
officer
you need to assist with
Healthy people just in the
community and think as a parole
board member I would be able to
hopefully insurance excesses out
in the community as well as
provide community and.
Safety for the communities the
pro the Slevin and utilize the
resources available in those
small communities because
sometimes you have to be
creative about it.
And I that's the experience I
have in corrections.
I get that it that's pretty much
it.
Thank you thank you very much
appreciate it very much and
Senator Wirth we heard at the
very beginning from Senators
FedEx regarding her
The process yes sponsoring if
you'd like to a few words about
Mr knight.
I would Mr chairman I appreciate
apologize for.
Jumping around in various
meetings
You know just taking a look at
Mr night is resume and his
service on the parole board I
believe since twenty thirteen so
this is a reappointment I mean
he has an extraordinary
background in public safety and
management also served for
eighteen months as the interim
chair of the parole board and so
are the fact that that someone
of this caliber has been doing
this now for eight years we
thank you for that for sure and
your willingness to step up and
serve again is something we very
much appreciate it and I just am
not again honor to be here as
his sponsor and thank you Mr
chair for the way you've put
this together with all the
members and again I think it's
very exciting to me having.
Served on the rules committee
for a number of years and then
being often having back on I
know the parole board has been
one of those areas that the
really happened some challenges
and I think it's very exciting
to see the caliber of folks that
are there now and certainly for
center Max sorely thank you for
for your leadership efforts with
the parole board again this is
this is an incredibly important
policy setting body and quite
frankly we want them to do the
job and follow the laws that are
in place and I feel like we've
got a group here that is
certainly willing to do that and
Mr line out again fits the bill
so happy to sponsor him and
again thank you very much for
stepping up the server.
I thank you very much Senator
Wirth and and let me when we
turn to the executive director
full parole board not just kind
of give us an orientation and
and before I do.
yield to this week certainly let
me also just say that that every
single one of you as you have
detail the background that you
have that has brought you to
this parole board up I'm just
super impressed.
bye bye the service that you all
have done throughout your
lifetimes and that you're
continuing now to do on the
parole board I'm super impressed
with the background that each of
you has and I just want to thank
you on behalf of the rules
committed on behalf of the state
legislature and while the state
that I can speak for the house
up for for for the continued
service in the service hard that
you all have any willingness
just to to do what really is in
many ways has been a second
religious Farrell said is almost
like a part time job for more
and and and and so thank you all
very much.
director Charlie let us would
you kind of let us know as
senator Wirth said you don't we
this is been a board that we
have I think we kind of
struggled with for many years on
a number of issues kind of where
things are moving with the
parole board you kind of orient
us to some of that and then we
will follow up with their
questions to the board.
Thank you Mr chairman and
members of the board of members
of the committee it's an honor
to be here this morning I want
to thank you for your time and
doing this of the first thing I
want to impress upon you is that
we now have a great four we
still have a few more positions
to fill but on a fifteen member
board when I came in under this
governor there were only seven
members on the board.
Now we're up to
thirteen and we hope to have a
full complement in a few months
but it's a tremendous board I'd
also like to thank the governor
for her leadership in appointing
all these members I'd like to
say specifically the leadership
on this board with us chair at
Anaya has been spectacular.
well we say this is a volunteer
board and and the members
receive per diem I want to
remind the members of the
committee that you only receive
per diem for the day you
actually have hearings yet these
members spend hours preparing
the files with highly sensitive
highly confidential information
and I can tell you when I sit in
on these board meetings I'm
amazed at how these members are
able to.
Draw out the most important
information from witnesses or
from
potential parolees and also how
they're able to call them out if
there's B. S. being spoken.
and let me also say as Senator
Wirth mentioned.
What I want in the past we've
had.
parole boards that specifically
said in public in front of the
committee and in front of the
legislature that they would not
follow the law.
And yet this is a board which is
totally reverse that these
members are meticulous in the
way they work on this and follow
the law.
And also it's a cohesive board
over and over again I witnessed
these members volunteering
volunteering their time to train
new members volunteering their
time to do administrative work.
To give you an idea of what
these matter how far these
members go I have members of
this board who bring their
children adult children to the
parole board to volunteer their
time to do the administrative
work that the agency hasn't been
able to get done.
We have been scheduled for six
and seven FTEs and we've never
been able to reach that now
that's partially the result of
COVID but it's also a result of
Of
low salaries that we're paying
for instance we just lost one of
our critical members of our
agency FTEs who had been with
the agency for awhile and she
left and went to another state
job for a two dollar an hour
raise just about and and that's
scary that that that could
happen at any time.
But to give you an idea of how
far we've come when I came into
the school of HSD there were ten
years of files packed in boxes
that were really a health hazard
and a fire hazard.
And our agency has now boxed and
sent to records where they
belong.
More than six hundred and thirty
boxes of records so that
Well can actually go through and
find these records
We have also reduced the number
of scratches as you remember
when I was in the legislature.
we had four million dollars a
state with spending on potential
parolees who couldn't get a
hearing in front of the board
costing state four million
dollars we have reduced
scratches by almost eighty
percent by the the dedication of
this board and my staff to which
is
Amazing.
I hope that gives you a little
idea of how dedicated and how
diverse and how wonderful these
members are I just want to thank
you I want to thank the governor
I want to thank the members of
the board up everything good is
happening as a result of their
dedication thank you.
Thank you very much and and also
before we get to the members of
proboards.
for questions missiles or would
you let the members of the
of the personnel board know that
we will get to them this
afternoon.
In that way we could spend the
rest of our time this morning
with the well on the pro boards
to members of the committee yes
questions.
For members of the parole
board's Senator Ortiz Y. Pino.
Thank you very much Mr chairman
and and the Senator McSorley
thank you for for bringing us up
to date on progress being made.
And I I to incredibly impressed
with the with the group of.
Nominees that you brought before
us here today I want to thank
the governor for for really
upgrading the caliber.
Of people on the parole board
that being said I have a
question a couple of questions
for you all.
And and and this is our one
chance to to hear from people
who work in the day to day
operations of our parole system.
All of you.
You too person seem to have a
great experience.
With corrections with public
defenders offices.
With police activity with parole
in as full time parole officers.
I'm my question is and and don't
feel like you have to answer
this but if any of you have any
suggestions for ways in which.
Our corrections system in New
Mexico.
Most needs to be improved if you
could share those with us so
that we can begin to addressing
some of that legislatively I
would really appreciate hearing
from any ideas you have for
things that we ought to be
paying more attention to.
Mr chairman I'll defer to the
chairman of the board I I think
he has a great handle on how
things are going.
Thank you to rex.
Mr Chairman Senator Ortiz Y.
Pino this is a great question
this is something that we look
at and we have really good
looking out for the last two
years since I became the
interpreter instead of how we
can we best model are services
to help these folks coming out
rehabilitate and never return.
And there are two things and I'm
sure you've heard this a number
of times they keep coming over
back over and over one
department of health services.
A lot of folks unfortunately
they suffer from a mental
health.
Whatever the mental health issue
maybe and they end up self
medicating that with the drugs
methadone seeking actual medical
help and and that builds an
addiction so that we have a two
pronged problem one we have the
mental health issue as well as
the drug addition issue that we
must do with on the outside I
will say the department of
corrections we've been working
hand in hand with the probation
parole division our relationship
with them has never been
stronger and we're starting to
see those services materialize
and getting the folks the help
they need.
The other issue is of course the
override epidemic that has
really interested not only our
state but the rest of the
country and we see so many young
people in front of us that they
going for something as simple
surgery for a to the old and the
doctor gives some in our Kotick
and their hopes for on that drug
research alive and these are
very tragic stories and that
works really trying to work with
these young individuals to help
get them clean from this and
move them away from any kind of
addiction now that is a struggle
and you folks the legislature
have been excellent with giving
us the resources that we need to
battle this and we just continue
to look for your support in that
battle.
I'd like to say something having
worked in corrections for as
long as I did and.
Ninety five percent of that
probation parole.
The people that were most
successful.
After being released had really
been worked with with
reintegration.
And we see this deal when we
have somebody come back before
us as a violator of parole that
they were not very well prepared
upon release and I'm very proud
that we actually are like us
Abram said worked very closely
with appropriations pro recently
on report writing and some
issues like that but as far as
the the prison system bass a
suggestion that I have.
Thank you very good.
Anybody else Mr looser actually
yet but.
Thank you I appreciate the time
my background is that I've
work too detention both adult
and youth.
Also worked with the.
The use in regard to attendance
at schools and not some of the
communication amongst our
agencies it needs to be a little
a little swifter and probably
more more accurate.
I think that the up the training
of staff of the new age that are
use live and today being
relevant to the purpose that up
maybe the funding is attached to
for example when I ran new day
shelter.
Those kids are running away from
things that were either
oppressive in their life for a
danger to their lives and yet in
order to take those things into
the shelter we have to
accumulate all of their
background information that they
didn't want to share so many
times we are not up to date.
What is current with our clients
today and I think it's important
not only to up
became aware of it but the
retention of staff training
staff is also relevant to what
the success of our of our
efforts here in New Mexico.
It is it is it your impression
as a group that the Mr Chairman
it is that the are the nominees
can the the satisfied with the
level of programming in our
facilities to adequately prepare
the men and women in corrections
for life outside the educational
and other rehabilitation
programs to job training so on.
Mister chairman Senator Ortiz
Pino.
In the past resoundingly the
answers now as it is now with
this new administration and and
a lot of the programs that I've
seen first hand we're getting
there we're on the right track
they're starting to now work a
lot of the programs for their
introducing.
Mental health programming
getting ready for release an
entry into the community there
are working very diligent about
education getting people GT's
calls courses trade schools are
working very hard at substance
abuse issues of course this has
to the person has to be willing
to participate and we found the
majority are willing to
participate that want to be a
present.
So we're getting there are with
their now not quite but I think
we're on a very good track.
I'd like to say seven Mr chair
and senator Ortiz ET now just
with my background in
corrections
setting conditions of parole and
reviewing parole violators I I
will be honest I've heard a
number of times.
I'm told by leaders I was not
prepared I think that
corrections I agree with the
chairman and I and I corrections
has come a long way and they're
getting there but those
reintegration programs
especially those people that
have done significant amount of
time in prison they they need
that reintegration programs
implemented in corrections prior
to them releasing or some sort
of program when they get out
like the I mean the there's
halfway houses.
But where the communication
we're getting back from these
these it inmates are that
there's no programming within
those you know what's in those
halfway houses so yes the the
programming addressing the
mental health and substance
abuse issues and most you know
and as well with that
reintegration programs needed
prior to the release and while
they are on probation or parole
supervision would be very
beneficial to to those people in
our state thank you.
Thank you Mr chairman the those
are all my questions I'm very
impressed with this a group of
nominees and I look forward to
seeing big changes in the
future.
Thank you senator Neville other
members of the committee.
Senator Lopez.
Thank you very much Mr chairman
and good to see you Senator
And first of all thank you to
each of you for your service to
the state and I know that over
the past few years
the parole board has been
lacking as was mentioned and Mr
chairman you know for
board members what I do have a
question to ask is how are your
hearings being conducted at this
point.
I know the past we haven't had
the reserve bank one person that
was holding some hearings
previously it's been a few years
back but what the hell you're
distributing
The the hearings to be held how
many members are present
etcetera.
Madam chair I also be feel free
to defer to the the board chair
at member and I and chairman I.
Thank you very much for the.
Mr chair Senator Lopez
currently now as a it's really
it's Santa Fe New Mexico is our
numbers are significantly higher
which means we have much more
people attending these hearings
for a typical determined here
and we have to board members
sitting on every panel now can
you individuals coming up with
an indeterminate or a life
sentence we have three that way
we always have an odd number
during sex offender hearings we
have three for the same reason
as well as parole revocation
hearings as well as medical in
geriatrics here it's now
typically each board member will
see about five to six months and
then those hearings depending on
what the docket is for that
facility we can have anywhere
from ten to twenty hearings for
the specific.
Now the much.
The fear is that take much more
work are the parole violations
and we have a number of the
board members that have just
stepped up and done a phenomenal
job with these because they do
take a lot of background work to
accomplish this those parents do
tend to last a whole lot longer
and in most states that their
schedule will work in a tire for
eight hour day to work all the
different here it's.
That's your question.
Yes it doesn't thank you Mr
chairman and I appreciate that
now we have enough board members
to fulfill the responsibilities
right that have been tasked to
our parole board so thank you
very much I did want to say also
just a quick shout out for
fellow valley I think
service but SF I too graduated
from valley high school so again
valley Vikings
I'm sorry run the service yes Mr
losers who I worked here your
paperwork that we have here in
front just a saco valley if I.
State representative former
state representative
S. Santa of course was a proud
valley Viking so had he been
part of this hearing I'm sure he
would been scarred scene the
valley Vikings song which I
don't intend to do
I tend to do that
and then of course to just
wanted to give a shout out also
for ana I just it's good to see
you again I know we always
valued your participation with
us the Senate Judiciary.
And I'm glad to see that
your of wealth of information
experiences being put to good
use with regards to the parole
board so that's all Mr chairman
thank you.
Thank you very much.
Other members of the committee
about the the chair has couple
questions at this time very good
three let me address couple
issues with the with the board.
And if if some members of
particularly those who may not
have responded already could
give answers but but I do want
to hear brought of answers a one
is that we have struggled over
the years.
With what we originally called I
think more accurately and house
parole we would then want to use
euphemism of release a legible
and mates.
and and and so where are we on
on people.
Who who have gotten their check
out date but haven't been able
to get out.
Of the of the prison yet in
terms of of having a full plan
If anybody could.
Could could update me on that
place.
Mr Chairman the.
Administratively I can say that.
Almost a hundred percent of
those potential parolees in the
prison who have find.
Who have been provided a Kerr
all plan I've had a parole
hearing and as I said earlier we
have reduced scratches by almost
eighty percent meaning eighty
percent of almost four million
dollars but I would also like to
defer to my chair if you would
like to say something on the.
Thank you director Charlie.
Mr chair a committee members
that is a great question that is
something that we work very hard
with the department of
corrections and counts I will
give a shout out to them they've
done a great job of identifying
those people that are up for
parole well in advance so we're
seeing a lot more people six to
three months before the it the
the door so we can have these
hearings and time that we're not
having this issue also greatly
reduced of the number of.
Transfers I know that was a big
issue transferring one
individual from one facility to
another facility and they get
lost what happens for lack of
better terms and during that
that's when they typically go
are yeah I.
There are a number of very
difficult hard to place
individuals but you mentioned
that the struggle to find a
place to get out there's been a
lot of work done to work with
these folks we've just
instituted you pilot program
which we can get them into their
own apartment with out the
sponsor which is going to
prevent these folks from staying
in prison of filing their number
these are people that have no
family they have no friends all
take command most halfway houses
don't want to touch them because
of their specific offenses or
because of mental health
conditions some of them are sex
offenders which really limits
the ability where they can go
to.
If local so that doesn't have
adequate housing available these
folks are literally stuck with
nowhere to go other than stand
present we are not working on
ways of the levy eight in that
and that's our work a number of
in house rules has dropped
dramatically I believe the last
time we looked at the number we
had twenty for all of last year
which is a huge improvement as
you're well aware.
I am I am well aware that does
anybody else on the on the board
want to comment on the.
On on getting people processed
in the and a parole plan what
not because this is this is been
a major issue with the parole
board in the past this is even
if the executive director work
with with that inmates to get
them a plan the parole board
oftentimes would say that's not
a sufficient planner and
acceptable one
The up let me let me follow up
Mr and I up on something that
you just mentioned in terms of
of of people who are in this one
the status and a lot of these
are the five twenty folks.
And and there's a at you know
the the AG's office I think this
has mistaken what the law says.
And the parole board has
followed the lead of the AG's
office in the past in that.
when you when when you extend
past the five years they're
supposed to be our current
convincing evidence of the need
to continue to have to
provision.
And and the the position
seems to to have been in the
past from both the AG's office
and the parole board
I almost that that the person
the parole leave needed to show
they would for the presumption
that they would need to show
current convincing evidence that
they didn't requires provision
past five years.
Where is the board.
Mr and I am members of the of
the committee in terms of in
terms of the five twenty folks
and the presumption of five
years and only twenty and only
extending beyond the five years
if there's if there's somebody
who's resistant to reintegration
are resistant to supervision.
Members of the committee that's
a great question and then on the
board as long as I have I have
set up on the sex offender
review arsenal are some of the
parole board for many many years
you're absolutely right in the
past it was almost flipped that
they had to sure extraordinary.
Service fall under parole before
we were going to release that
that has changed since since I
became the interim chair we have
changed a lot of the primers the
way we do business we really
individualize each case that we
look at each case based on its
own merits and we follow the
state statute a lot more closely
eliminating any kind of personal
subjectivity to it so we have
addressed this and I sit on all
of these as well as Mr Liu
Senator Mr Serra can attest to
the conversations we have as to
the individual of the done well
have it been confined have it
done everything the state of New
Mexico as ask them and if that
is the case they have shown
reasonably that they deserve a
second chance at life and to be
removed from Raul and it's not
their burden to prove that what
they need to be operable it is
the state's burden of proof to
show that they need to continue
on supervision.
Mr Chairman may I address that
issue also
got this sense as I recall you
did some legislation on this
issue back in the day and now
you're in a position of
administering.
Yeah this very issue of totaling
the five year and two and a half
year time limit is also now in
front of the state Supreme Court
there been something like eleven
different decision said go both
ways in the District Court and
so the Supreme Court is taking
up this issue and we're just
waiting for
a decision by the New Mexico
state court in the statute there
are the words in the community
which is what everybody is
trying to decide what that means
and we are very.
Reluctant to
Interpret state statute if you
would like us to change we will
and you want to change the
statute we are certainly open to
whatever you feel is in the best
interests of the state of New
Mexico Mr chair.
Nobody wants to change that
statute but the name on it but
You know but it is it is so what
is what is the issue that's
before the state Supreme Court.
Whether or not a person who is
on parole when return to prison
that time in prison Coles the
five years that they're supposed
to be before they get another re
hearing or the two and a half
years for rehearing.
I think that I mean certainly
certainly I mean at at what
point they're almost seem to be
in it Senator don't seem to be
interpretation of somebody who
goes back and present but almost
going to black called for the
next twenty years and I and I
and I would hazard to say that
that is clearly not the
I don't think that's
constitutional even if that was
the intent of the legislature
and and so you know it it should
be interpreted in a manner that.
That that is meaningful due
process to folks.
On this.
I also say these are very
complicated matters in that many
times these people are not only
serving parole but they're
serving probation and sometimes
they have holds and detainers on
them for other matters too so
and whether or not they get a
parole hearing sometimes it's
beyond our
purview as to whether or not
they are released or not it's
very complicated I understand
that I understand it looks I I
do want to follow up on the on
the.
the whole issue that that most
people most people who are on
parole or also information due
to the success of our system
works.
And and the and so when when
folks get a parole hearing on
the on the rare occasion that
they beat the the parole
hearing.
a parole officers often times
within taken in preparation
hearing.
and
and and and and and so you know
it's it's almost like you know
the person can't can't quite
kind of break I thought miss
Lopez responding to that as I
was as I was saying it
you know those of you who who
worked in PPD I think a very
very familiar with us with this
whole process.
So and and to some degree
there's not much you can do
about that.
Because that's the that's the
determination of the department
of as opposed to the
what the parole board does might
my question is though having in
the past Representative people
through some of these process
sees is that
when when people would have a
parole hearing.
either before the border before
the hearing officer they were
informed that they did not have
the right to counsel.
In those hearings particularly
if we're talking about someone
who's already in the community
and we're talking about a
potential violation what is the
what is the position of the of
this board.
As to as to a parolees right to
have the right or privilege for.
Four option to have
representation of when they come
before either one of the hearing
officer's for this board.
If you don't mind I will be
happy to defer to a the board
member Lopez who does these
parole violation hearings and
the those are the ones that may
or may not have an attorney that
thank you.
I'm gonna pass
yes Mr chair and members of the
committee thank you for that
question and it is honestly a
really good question I can tell
you what the hearing officer's
work for the department of
corrections so with all due
respect I can't answer for the
department of corrections but I
can most certainly answer for
the New Mexico about proboards I
know every member that here's
inmates for their final program
Batesian hearings if an inmate
asks for mint Attorney
assistance we ask a series of
questions to determine if that
eligibility is there and I
believe the corrections
department does that as well
a lot of times you know they'd
still that it's their right to
have the turning which it is.
But is it needed you know so
there's a series of questions
that we ask to determine that I
can tell you personally that
there has been.
A few several times that I felt
that the inmate needed attorney
assistance.
And I deferred that we did not
hear on because I felt that we
were not going to.
I wanted his rights or their
rights to be protected
So we deferred that till we
could hopefully get assistance
sweat soaked through the public
defender's office to get this
person council at their final
revocation hearing because you
know it is taking their freedoms
so you know we do look at those
request for attorney assistance
very closely and very seriously.
Are just said though is that you
just because there's a question
so that you can determine.
If they need an attorney.
Well the board as a whole yes
the three members that are on
that final replication here yes
we asked we asked those
questions to those inmates.
Right and and so I guess what's
problematic for me is that if
the inmate.
I get most of them would would
otherwise have public defender
but sometimes they have their
own turning.
If the inmate has you on their
own attorney for the board to
then ask a series of questions
to determine if the if the
inmate needs an attorney.
needs the assistance of an
attorney.
means that means that then
you're deciding whether or not
whether or not the attorney
would be present at all.
Well the board and that's why we
have the three panel members
because as a board to decide
okay eight based on our
interview with them do they need
an attorney or do they not
that's been the protocol for the
parole board
honestly since I worked a
correction started in nineteen
eighty eight.
Yeah and and and my experience
is currently is that the
position parole folks have
always been no you don't need an
attorney we'll take care of you
don't worry about it
What is what is the criteria
that you use to determine if
somebody quote unquote needs an
attorney or not.
Well the criteria as if you know
the the level of education
What why they still they need an
attorney and a lot of times
those those inmates they will
they'll just say well because
it's my right we're not a court
of law it's an administrative
hearing.
So there's a there's a
difference there.
yet and I understand that
submission hearing but there are
other administrative hearings
for people have a right to have
counsel present up.
Yeah you're director.
The other issue here is
traditionally under common law
these issues of parole and right
to attorney are determined it
sentencing and if you look at
judgment and sentences in the
state of New Mexico the judges
specifically tell the.
the.
The person to be sentenced that
if they do accept parole they
lose under certain circumstances
there right to an attorney and
again we have to defer to the
judgment in sentencing
as it's been defined under
common law in New Mexico so
these are gray areas that
are board members are forced to
deal with but until we change
judgment in sentencing our board
members are very reluctant to.
Change the statutes and the
things under which they have to
work and that
I would just say it was service
resorting and miss Lopez members
of the of the board.
That I do understand the common
law I do understand the position
historically.
That when someone is on
probation they are out but under
supervision and when someone is
on parole they are technically
still in but in the community.
And and that and that that is
the reason why there is
historically been no right to
way to weigh up an attorney when
somebody is on parole up I.
The J. M. S. is that I've seen.
Indicate that you may not will
but may lose your right to an
attorney.
And and so that would not
inhibit this board from revising
its rules.
And ensuring that people who
request to have an attorney.
who are out in the community
for revocation hearing.
Our will be permitted to have
internet and and and that it be
the decision of the person
requesting the Attorney.
not the decision of the board as
to whether or not they would
have an attorney and and and I
would.
This is this is not an issue
that is going to hold up it but
its confirmation but I will just
tell you all this is something
that I would very strongly
encouraged this board to be
proactive about.
because because quite candidly
there's been discussion the
people were on probation at the
same time they're on parole that
maybe we should just get rid of
parole other than for
reconsideration of life
sentences.
and so and so
So so quite frankly I would I
would really.
In the strongest terms encourage
you all to be proactive about
this issue.
and to revisit understanding the
historical nature but
considering the modern world in
which we live.
of whether or not this board
should should adopt a new rules
on that issue.
Mr chairman members of the
committee I appreciate you
stating that
thank you.
Member Gabrielle like to suffer
all had to something she want to
say about that yes.
I thank you Mr chairman members
of the committee I just want to
let you know that.
The administrative code for the
parole board requires the public
defender department to make
representation available to sex
offenders that are
Basing a parole hearing for sex
offender parole revocation
hearing but it's discretionary
by case law it's discretionary
up to the parole board whether
or not as Mrs Lopez said to have
an attorney at any other
revocation hearing for parolees
but I do as a former public
defender I do wholeheartedly
believe that there should be the
right to counsel any hearing at
any hearing that any pearly has
and.
The public defender Department
if the parolees indigent should
be required to represent that
that for only and we did Mr
chair.
When we change the rules
regarding this sentence as
adults part of that
administrative change was that
the youth are entitled to have
representation.
And and and and this government
is feral let me just
so the store not is actually the
statute the mails been robots in
statute.
that they'll be represented by
the public defender sent back we
had to go back and amend that
stature appears safe for thirty
of their choosing as it was
being interpreted that only the
public defender could represent
those people.
but but
you know you cannot control with
the department does about re
prosecuting somebody on the
provisions that you cannot
control what the public
defender's Department does law
office of the public defender
does in terms of whether not
they choose Representative
somebody was just question but
what you can do is indicate that
somebody has an attorney.
That they're allowed that that
Attorney as a lot of here with
the but you can do is indicate
that somebody would like to
request an attorney that does
not come to to create
unreasonable delay.
That that that that request can
be forwarded to the PED's office
for the PED's office to make
their determination.
You can do that.
And so that so that if somebody
shows up with an attorney as I
have shown up with people on
parole I don't have to sit
outside.
What they decide whether or not
I will be allowed Representative
my client.
So so so I understand you cannot
control.
The department and you cannot
control the law office of the
public defender but you can
control the parole board and the
procedures of the parole board.
And that's and that's what I'm
encouraging you to do without
stepping on other areas of
jurisdiction.
Thank you Mr chairman.
Madam yes Representative.
We.
This all kind of.
Like I said earlier I've been
with the department for twenty
four years and up I do have a
lot of experience with the rule
while vacations and stuff but.
You Sir are.
We feel disadvantaged if.
If I was going to be
hearing with the with an
attorney if you live in my
ignorance would be like me going
to court and trying to
Representative way my friends.
And tell me that I'm not an
attorney I'm not a licensed
attorney there for.
Probably don't really have much
of a right to be there for the
best interest that not put us at
a major disadvantage as a board
member that in some sense I am
the only person and be and will.
Argument not necessarily all.
There were you having arguments
with a licensed certified
attorney
would not comment on major
disadvantage because I wouldn't
be able to.
Talk about the legality of the
that's going on with all due
respect that's my questions
gentleman.
I'll be happy to answer that
first of all workforce solution
hearing officers are not
attorneys by large and yet
people and workforce solutions
have attorneys able to represent
them on both sides both the
employer and employee and those
and those of hearing officers
who are not attorneys make those
decisions on a regular basis not
all of the
prior to the formation of the
impending hearing office
of the independent hearing
office not all of the tax and
run a hearing officer's
returnees we have other areas in
law where we have people who are
hearing officers and they are
not attorneys and yet people
frankly is a state personal
office they're not attorneys and
any other attorneys are
Representative people through
the CPO process and and I guess
the one thing that I would say
is that while you may feel at a
disadvantage if somebody has an
attorney no matter what happens
at the hearing you're going home
to
you're going home and sleeping
in your bed that night.
The person who's sitting before
you
is not necessarily going home to
set and to sleep in their bed.
And and so and so when you
consider what's at stake for the
parolees.
I'm candidly not overly
concerned with with your
disadvantage in that issue I
will also put up by the way that
magistrate judges The New Mexico
are not required to be attorneys
up in fact I think one of you on
this panel was not an attorney
was about stretch at.
And and municipal judges are not
required to be attorneys and yet
they have attorneys before them
all the time so so that is that
is actually not an unusual
process
of the to have a non attorney.
Our panel making a determination
even if somebody has an
attorney.
Presenting them in that process
and and like I said you're going
to go home and that person might
be spent in the next several
years in prison.
Thank you Mr.
Thank you Mr chairman we hear
you loud and clear.
Well are there other questions
from the committee for this
panel.
Well I'd I'd I very much want to
thank this panel for being here
and I really want to thank you
guys for the discussion.
this is I've got to tell you
that this is from from where we
have been.
This is just super exciting.
and even the last ten minutes
the fact we're able to have this
discussion it's super exciting
because previous proboards
wouldn't even entertain that
conversation and and so
really we want to thank you guys
for your service
I want to thank you all for for
really the incredibly difficult
work that you do and the
judgment calls that you make.
And we know it's not easy.
And we know that you are making
decisions not only about the
liberty of an individual but the
health and safety of
communities.
And and while that's really
truly
I have a burden and a heavy task
and thank you all very much for
the service that you provide to
the state.
So with that we're going to be
in recess until one thirty this
afternoon.
so missiles are will pick up
with the personnel board at that
time and then we'll we'll

agenda at that point thank you

discussion.
Thank you Mr chairman members of
