Mr chairman if I could just
respond because I do think it's
important the members know what
the process was very very short
we did fall this year she
process because this year she
specifically said.
We need the legislature this was
their direction to us we need
the legislature to help reach a
tribal consensus and work on
that they couldn't and their
work was done so the idea that
we would do that and then go
back they're finished that was
our charge to them they told us
what to do and we follow so the
idea that we get all of the
CRC's process is false we get
and with respect to Hispanic
districts I want to point out I
want to make sure I had the
information right the data
actually support twenty four H.
B. A. P. majority districts
eight house bill eight has
twenty seven H. B. A. P.
majority districts so the idea
that we have somehow been
discriminatory towards Hispanics
as a completely false attack and
I just can't say it is a nice
way chair after you're saying
twenty four Hispanic districts
and states like New Mexico
vision I I will not accept.
Because of that.
Have that conversation many
minutes on twenty seventh is not
enough this is franchises.
I.
That are doing well.
Yeah.
For all the.
Asked on
based on that factor Senator
Lopez center one.
Thank you Mr chair not senator
Morris kind of got into what I
was going to talk about here
Mister chair I think it's we we
were close to the twenty four
districts is.
Representative a state of almost
a million status active the fact
this is the structures that
Hispanics are being forgotten in
this shell game that we're doing
what we're trading one Roberson
for number
that's how I do.
C. R. C. C. process was awful
wasn't followed because this is
not a CRC Matt so what happened
please.
We got the CRC maps the side
life that we didn't think we had
certain people come in and put
certain about the pressures of
people that are here so that we
could change the maps to
whatever suited now Cremins can
read its case right and those
agreements presented this is one
of those of you we can
we can see on this that came out
of the houses and you know
there's a lot of people that
aren't happy with the.
Status.
And that in my opinion Mr chair
that's just.
And I think the.
This was a.
Most.
There.
The first.
That.
Your static population the white
because they're not organized.
Your.
Rally against this kind of stuff
is a lot of the medical this
some of our that's the real
truth.
Our.

terrible.
All three access for your team

The gentleman did very well at
thirty four.
The legislative practice at
thirty four fifty.
This is the leading category
that.
The.
And and so.
Well you know I do agree with
the.
Madam.
Senator Moores that that's not
what we need food and beverages
for.
To make a decision.
but.
The demographics of the state of
North seven we.
Some places on the margins.
We need to change the direction.
But at some point and
practices is that right.
And and those will flow over
time.
