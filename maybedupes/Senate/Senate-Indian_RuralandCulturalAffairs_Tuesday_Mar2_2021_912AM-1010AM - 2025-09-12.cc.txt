Are there New Mexico and are
major contributors to Rio Arriba
County and ensuring that they
don't only take care of the
people on the Pueblo but they
have something called a need a
good neighbor policy know what
that means is the public is
committed to helping communities
around the pueblo and ensuring
that they protect not only the
people in these communities but
they offer assistance such as
clean drinking water and they
also have one of the only public
schools on public land which is
San Juan elementary so
definitely a good neighbor I'm
excited that governor agree no
in his first term has a big box
with the staff on what he wants
to see done in the public and
today they're going to be doing
a presentation on one other
major capital outlay requests

treatment facility one that
would help the public's
neighboring communities so with
that I'm gonna turn it over to

Sure former governor and still
not working on this project for
quite a few years and so
Sure just local entities can
show up on this.
So.
Existing wastewater treatment
facility that's corroding
you know
working on this project for a
few years you know we're.
Probably five years of of last
four if that helps you all
Your available
which if they are on the house
Senate house and John and sister
run on this bill which you know
we're.
Bill flooding will pose a health
hazard
in all the years we've been able
to.
People using the the flow of.
Twenty thousand jobs per day
well we have experience you try
numbers you know as you all know
we do these days we have
activities are out of.
This is the social gatherings
and I just think but you know we
have to our traditional culture
in all that's a huge part of the
you know we also have the
existing water treatment
facility built over two years
ago nineteen ninety eight are
the slightest Authority with a
patient.
Whether there is a sense that
providers okay.
Resources.
the short terms of you know
social division.
Representative.
Three percent a year and so over
in all our our population
growing we're in the next
twenty.
Years
and so we gotta under James also
over the years used to be a lot
of on our on going to cause a
lot of our various we're all
flying and there's the leader
within the reservation on in
order
to provide services share with
your more soul also made a huge
change so you're and so that's
what I did and receive a.
Members were as well with the
problem
also
for the incorporation of the
little the lan application
design and all and the P. R..
The report for us to recycle
water will also be treated.
What is your health and
recreational facility you know
Representative Townsend
relational.
We did start to local council to
go to the projects are connected
with each other and so the
server is roughly about thirty
four size on will require.
A little over a hundred and
eighty thousand gallons of.
One hundred eighty so
additional.
This will be a result was
holding water the grass is going
to be all that are with all
those
so all well
as a trying to get on
their returns huge hi
these right here in our
reservations all.
Well our existing water
treatment facility that I those
are pictures because Roseanne
of the facility General.
These politicians are seasonal
it also facilitates streamline
all of
thanks for structure on the
reservation.
Areas of hero or.
What.
Well as.
that's.
Slide.
Of the existing systems like I
mentioned earlier on.
The old facility issues right
now.
Of all the risks are this is
lying can all on over twenty
years twenty to twenty five
years you know I just talked to
really replacing the reason why
we're trying to do this
This is because you for good
neighbor policy.
Right now.
As a the only thing.
Infrastructure for.
Based on.
Mexico.
this town.
I'm going.
Okay our own state.
Well we all know what is the
well as normal over time and
thank you kind Sir will
contaminate the the article for
the landing the ability to call
off the diseases such as Ebola.
On and on and so so as.
Doing in all within the exterior
boundaries the public only show
roughly four
percent of our nine days of
people so the other eighty
percent are you on tribal.
The that all I mean I guess we
call it a whole table for
runners you know they were able
to to develop a claim within the
the reason so eighty percent so
that's a huge number when we
talk about the numbers you know
we're talking.
Eleven thousand other people
external properties that are not
tribal you know we want to help.
Systems and and to protect all
of our in our water over time.
Nations so right now is this
early edition you can hold one
hundred and seventy five
thousand gallons of waste
Receive over a hundred and
twenty dollars thousand gallons
per day you know mention earlier
that owns a lot of our
on the state's holidays are now
with the COVID standing order.
A lot of our kids families
working from home or at school
and school our system is your
own relationship between.
So far so good in all look
forward to the future going on.
This is a little tiny thanks
well.
Today in all members of the
armed on final word twenty
group health services in the
home screen.
Resolution number twenty six in
that.
I'm gonna try and extend the on
relations system.
I had
to the new system adjacent to
the existing system in the same
area you know the entire house
was completed in two thousand
sixteen by marrying associates
and in all
The
New Mexico
resolution to this channel
eleven on one adverse affect on
this project in general twenty
twenty the goal was also
completed until this in two
thousand sixteen and on water
also solution providing the
waste water systems
incorporated into the P. R..
All over this budget as you can
see written on the side we got a
rude.
In the health services.
We were actually working as the
district engineer for IIHS you
can see the whole project
project
Million dollars
hello and upgraded to an oral.
Senator is on.
The two thousand or two thousand
for lan applications
recreational facility on and on
to the
judge beds
you know engineering
construction inspection
contingencies also.
One of the soul hello to table
Representative is a look for
some help on all and you all are
just the state but in nineteen.
For the residential developments
also side program you're single
the reason why the project was
funded for two dollars going
to sort of pass on the C. in the
next slide and so we will we
will forward
it to the owners in that region
and the twenty twenty structure
grant application we were
awarded.
Roughly over three million
dollars to complete the facility
now yes these changed
Because online it John.
One who is also important to all
of the median household.
Change within USDA well as a
longer eligible for the services
side funding.
What does that do it complicates
things right because now we're
on the line with the
Jeff Graham with others but now
we're short two million dollars
through proceed with this
project so we're gonna we're
facing challenges on
whether we are able to
get.
Or back to the state minimum
that's not always a good thing
for for the.
You can give us a lot trying to
the fact that.
Well during the week now general
view is the.
Sort of Santa in the middle of
the game
really.
And Dr J. treatment.
But we're also continuing the
jobs is a concern in the
household income.
And so I'm gonna let her talk
about reversing the money back
to do is you know I also.
Into the ground loan program.
So right now we're we put in a
request welding on for one
million dollars which was closed
on is that on the envelope are
to be able to qualify for the
the grant.
Ingle completed this project is
really rulal you know we do have
a house apartment or these are
going on as far as housing and
so without the ability to.
Okay this system or no our house
is also gonna be in dire need
because we're not gonna have the
ability ability to comedy
any more race this existing
facility sort of all of the
problems really relying on this
project for the next.
Years.
Thanks.
The letter.
I will set aside program.
That you're trying to re enter
you all so you know we're very
happy that that is all it is and
then also it was huge and
appliance repair on average and
then.
General.
Caging and soul now we're in a
blue line but we also have.
Dollars that could possibly be
reverted to to
maybe impact on projects that
the representative check point.
For any questions in all letters
that will give you.
Governor regional.
Because
was Regina's I want to thank you
all on also.
A little bit of your busy
schedule today to present our
wastewater treatment facility
general as you can see there are
in this picture and
we're sharing a very.
From universes representative of
the year for tribal schools.
It seems that are given to.
What all of our surrounding
communities and everybody and
all around us whether we we are
in the government's blessing
this morning and all.
No ability open mind open heart
strong strong mind to think
about all of the needs of our
areas here in New Mexico and
hopefully our ability to to in
all construct do some of these
projects for the benefit of all
the people.
Mexico school with.
Stand for questions.
Thank you governor and thank you
Benny committee members does
anybody have any questions or
comments.
Senator Pinto followed by
Senator McKenna.
Yes so I'm looking at the would
you talked about the USDA income
limits the medium income limits
so we're saying we didn't.
how how does that work I'm
trying to to look here and I'm
not getting very secretary
of us here on she just walked in
because we're doing a project on
this because the latter myself
in her work.
All that going out on.
Good morning and thank you again
for the schools was.
Last last year we submitted our
grant application USCA reaches
out.
Median household income which is
like an average household income
and the New Mexico.
And okay is code is a seven five
six six.
Where site also includes a lot
of our Hispanic communities that
are also non Indian so it's kind
of interesting because USDA
tribal set aside funding only
for tribal members only for
tribal communities however once
they reached out and did the the
zip code it includes Tommy
genitals windy all week a and
special unity so that through
already in household income and
we're supply of in this
we're we reached out to several
people and we're actually
challenging that because because
a COVID a lot of our members
have lost their jobs.
And so you know not
to us either.
Change the game in twenty twenty
one with our grant applications
submitted and twenty one that's
why now they're saying that
they're trying to row the money
before longer eligible for the
tribe's program does that answer
your question Senator will and
So they have the changes so
there was no grandfather clause
say you guys were already in the
program in that sense and it
would in effect you but it did
affect you that's one question
and that's exactly what we're
challenging we're not getting
very far okay as far as an
answer about
the the funding so I'm looking
at it and I see that there's a
floor saying you know that
there's a bottom
is the.
I would a state the minimum wage
increase do you think that so
effectively it will affect you
guys I know we're in a big
difference situation right now
but I mean even before COVID
knowing that there was going to
be waging peace do you think
that would have pushed you above
the ceiling are you would still
have been right in that window
with the medium also the next I
don't think that will affect
using the the current and the
child prior to help with the
with the minimum wage going up.
Chair woman if you don't mind
I'd like to just make a few
comments governor if you don't
mind so what's happened is the
governor I have reached out to
senator Ben ray Lujan about this
issue and so they've that
they're working on it but we
haven't heard a follow up on
what's happening but what I
think has happened that skewed
the numbers because we know that
Rio Arriba county is a county
that's one of the poorest
counties in the state but I
think what's get their numbers
are the number of the national
Los Alamos National Laboratory
employees who live in the
surrounding communities around
the Pueblo that then threw off
that number right because you're
gonna see a high rate of pay of
these household of employees of
the laboratory that that didn't
truly reflect the pueblo and
ultimately the whole community
but I think that those high
numbers of laboratory employees
that's what definitely threw
them off but we did challenge
and wrote to the senator saying
that we were worried and
concerned that the public was
given the money and then told
that they don't have the money
anymore the threat then became
that the the money they had to
leverage is them in jeopardy
because of that yes.
So the
So there's nothing I mean it
would lose and I heard that they
said the doctor tribal.
And but they're still including
outside.
Okay was far as the foundry yes
the vehicle makes sense in the
sense of that so my assumption
is that there's no direct
language
or maybe has challenged.
to to set a precedence in this
I guess that that's a very good
has USD a better communicated
with you RT just been
question that is our.
Because madam chair because of
all the changes that happen or
change over that's in here USDA
the state for quite a few people
that have moved on or and you
know change
what also retired and so all all
the
Recognizable faces are are
gonna.
The really understand you know
we're getting on some of these
are really confused on as we
just did we just completed a lot
of water project page three and
I was also two dollars
VA.
So I program
that we just finalize that now
said everything's wrong
but you know all of us
on.
Along with just a little project
like this the waste water
because it qualifies as a real
action so we did we got all
worked in the state insurance
commissioner.
Anyone generate you know we're
receiving messages from them
that we no longer qualify after.
Axle you know I don't know what
really changes one household
income over here by a there's
challenges like center on.
You mentioned with the
laboratory being.
Close to us for your own.
It is it really doesn't make
sense because we just did a
project with them for two
million dollars under the same
the same numbers and all on this
project we're all.
It is night and I would
understand if it was if you guys
were all like all on the same
system but you're not it's a
separate system yes.
With the state M. as far it is
so we're there's money there in
the state but you're leveraging
at.
How's the communication flow
from.
Let's say from you guys through
this through the state to USDA
is there any person our agency
right in between because USDA
does handle a lot of loans the
VA loans mortgage loans
all kinds of other little
programs
besides what you guys are doing
an agricultural stuff do we have
a mediator or somebody that
deals directly with USDA from
the state level.
Senator this is Christy lied
again we are in constant
communication with Secretary of
Indian Affairs lantern hill.
And she was also sort of serving
as a liaison if you will.
When the state in the U. S. K.
also former employee of USDA.
So she's very aware of what's
going on the tenth Grammy thank
you little and she's very
supportive in helping.
Reach out to you as soon as well
so we're going to consider our
our liaison.
Okay okay I want to make sure
that we did have the some kind
of the way to the.
That you know for us to to help
the the ace in that in that form
thank you Mr chairman and
members of the committee.
I think I'll probably have more
questions but a look at some of
yield thank you.
Will now go to Senator McKenna
and then Senator Shendo followed
by Senator Griggs.
Good morning thank you.
Chairman how to meal and a
fellow employees won't be
out in the state Senate
committee on.
Okay
Thank you for being with us this
morning.
Why after your presentation I
didn't realize the challenges
that.
Okay when is experiencing but
it's certainly clear.
Like many things that the
government tries to use to.
In terms of needs Indian country
the use of the zip code is the
absolute wrong criterion.
When they are using.
Decisions on USA USDA grants and
the like.
I'm I'm curious and
chairman
you mentioned that's contact has
been made to senator Ben ray
Lujan I'm curious if
representatives
Leger Fernandez has also been
contacted about this.
We.
On.
I was hoping that maybe.
Ben Ray we're we're
trying to single and and
whatever support we need from
our representatives Senator
McKenna and governor and Benny
what I can do today as I can
caller today I didn't even think
about that Senator McKenna good
thinking we directly went to
senator Ben ray Lujan but
governor I can't commit to that
today I'll call Representative
to that's a Leger Fernandez and
senator McCain if you want to
join me on that call you'd be
more than welcome to.
The chairman I I do please
stand.
Many times the rational also
work in tandem with the Senate
offices so I think it would be a
great idea for us to do that.
And I.
The governor and staff I'm
curious because of.
Pandemic how has that affected
your because.
Eight and business operations.
Well I also chairman for the
gaming commission General.
It's not a huge impact in the
long.
The governor general
Number directions are different
times.
but you know our artisanal also
employs a huge amount of people
that are non tribals living
within the New Mexico and soul
it also and then you know
whether they were for oral and
everything else and all and the
whole screen you know just.
The mental part of COVID the
whole state is suffering from
and all the all the employment
on our education wise and
everything that's all.
Which is fine because you know
some of the.
To flow to the tribal government
focusing all
also for some of these projects
and and and
So it's it's been really
challenging on tribal council
administrations we just changed
over so we have a ministration
the change over within the last
month and I actually really.
Just hands Armstrong you know
everything that has happened
over the past year or soul
General
Fund because you are in that
short time you know we're in all
sorts is difficult you know the
personal thing.
You know a lot of hardships and
challenges there all.
Thank you.
R. do you and I'm I look forward
to.
He was my colleague and our
chair
Senator autumn you and see what
we can do to expedite and
That this decision I think you
USDA doesn't realize they've
made I don't think they have the
full.
The full picture
when they wrote that letter and
told and
Rescinded the award so thank you
very much for being with us and
could know what.
Thank
you senator we now go to Senator
Shendo and then we'll have
standard rates.
Thank.
Senator you're on mute.
About now.
I think senator what the
governor and I heard as you were
going to give us all your
capital outlay for this project.
It's already been advanced.
Check should be arriving
sometime.
Thank you Mr chairman and a
thank you the governor and the
members of the council and your
staff for a this update on your
project.
Things that I have you mentioned
tive so you got the tip award in
twenty twenty right yes so you
have what
eighteen months or three two
years what I can't remember what
the.
Just three years okay okay so
you so you have three years to
expand those funds.
All the are you are it is your
water treatment now like open
lagoons is that what they are
yes and your expanding those
lagoons basically well.
These pots that are at the G.
we've got the all of the rooms
that were more calls area.
We have they're still just in
as there is already a spill or
anything like that the goal is
to remove the vehicles also the
ones that were used in the
sixties and seventies.
So so the current a good do you
have you're saying that that is
now over capacity.
Okay R. O..
I don't know what you can do a
U. S. T. A. but I have a couple
of suggestions most of the
tribal administrative or pueblo
team as and you mentioned that
the COVID that has exacerbated
you know this issue because
we're asking people to wash hand
for twenty two seconds we have
more people at home from school
at from work.
We aim just use some of our
comment dollars towards our our
water system because we still
have old pipes from the the
ninety the early generation the
the the
those pipes and clay pipes yes
so as more use was happening we
were getting or breaks you so
the council we passed a
resolution justified that with
the add to you know of people
staying home washing more doing
laundry more folks at home this
became a huge issue for us and
we were able to use our dollars
for that purpose so I I I think
you have a legitimate case if
there's more funding coming from
the feds it's something that you
may want to look at.
I'm.
The other thing is a I I I the I
did see that your application of
I did talk to the governor's
office and I know that she's
also willing to say help tribes
with the larger capital projects
and I know that the
when I last I chatted with you
last week I I think.
At least there's a.
The proposal for your of million
dollar.
I guess this is what I'm looking
at the list that waste water
treatment facility I think
that's a priority that's been
submitted through Indian Affairs
to the governor's office yes
correct yes okay okay all right.
So we'll continue to make sure
that you know that that can stay
on the the governor's capital
list I know that go she ation is
still going on between the
governor's office and the
legislature in terms of of
capital dollars and and so forth
so
But the I just wanted to will
we'll do our best to make sure
that that funding is there
hopefully we can all agree on
and both on as a legislature
that final proposal comes with
your million dollar requests
we'll keep an eye on that but I
just wanted to make sure that
you know really look at those
COVID dollars you there might be
an opportunity if you got more
forthcoming with the next the of
help will come in you know I
know that there's been right now
Congress is just working on that
package right now but if he does
come through that might be
something the to work look at
because all has to do with the
Water and and and how it's
affecting our our our systems
whether to water system or you
know our our waste water system
because it all connected so I
have to get off here pretty soon
one of the five minutes but the
it's good to see you all and
it's been a long time since I
visited okay we gets I think we
visit
got over year and a half ago
with our our leadership with
regards to the work that we're
doing on our on our lands and so
forth so
We can the visit sometime soon
so you.
I'm just to comment on those are
very good questions on in all of
the two with the COVID dollars
but at the at the time you know
with the COVID dollars the only
option December well you know we
come from USDA we got the
remainder.
After the fact the in all the
tried
it as much as they could to
straddle COVID Ahlers you for
the end date of December thirty
of twenty twenty we received a
notification from USDA that we
no longer all generous all.
We were able to do it.
Is that we would have been
modified earlier in January so
all that goal is our key in on
down we hopefully we will in on.
Hopefully from dollars for
comment because there's a lot of
the things that still need to
get done but the crunch of the
reviewed by the government over
here.
Rating has already projects as
well as a tribal Replogle it
will be hard to spend those
dollars and sold.
This is the fact that all the
requirements that were done and
so they try to do it really well
and some of the other we did do
some wastewater projects I
can find that we were able to in
the later months and so we did
get some of that but it was just
