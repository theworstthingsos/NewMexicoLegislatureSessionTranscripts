HIV and aids HSBC vilest stages
the disease so that the virus we
test for sars COVID to our
natural coronaviruses these so
we just need to go back to jail
and also in here there is a
small public the motion over
time we refer to the contract
the contact tracing by
department of health rules
should be the center for disease
control for the ones we need to
for the guidance on changes as
Democrats ruled the roost and
that is on page two one thirteen
the state of New Mexico Public
Health initiated US Department.
It was the.
Information.
So let's take those one at a
time so I think the.
Let me ask you thanks to line
eighteen where it says Corona
virus disease two thousand
nineteen should that be sars
took to we should actually say a
severe acute respiratory
syndrome.
Corona virus to.
The Mr chair are we've it is to
fix that on page two started
online then I'll love in
administrative Corona virus
disease twenty nineteen and
insert the language I just said
severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus two okay
hold on a second.
So so before the work for rural
virus.
Severe.
The cute cute respiratory
respiratory syndrome.
Central and then if you leave a
Corona virus you need to put in
the number two in the number two
and strike disease two thousand
nineteen.
That answer there are two.
For instance the spokesman and.
Yeah and and that's my question
was whether or not it would
apply in all four instances on
the double checking that no on
line eighteen line eighteen okay
so before the work Corona virus
in Sir severe acute respiratory
syndrome.
After Corona virus insert the
word to end strike disease two
thousand nineteen.
And then what about line twenty
twenty.
Are you vaccinated that's needed
or vaccinated for.
You're vaccinated for against
the actual I was not the actual
seats okay so against is the
correct term but it should be
before Corona virus insert
severe acute respiratory
syndrome after corona virus to
strike disease two thousand
nineteen.
That.
starting on page or line twenty
two.
This is a real quick Senator
Ortiz been.
He's going to get okay twenty
two and twenty five.
Yeah seven that's a negative
test for.
Dollars will be to okay so
severe acute respiratory
syndrome before Corona virus.
after coronavirus answer the
number to strike disease and on
line twenty three strike twenty
nineteen.
And then what about line twenty
five twenty five twenty five you
test positive for the virus.
That's very good so for twenty
five before Corona virus severe
acute respiratory syndrome.
After coronavirus the number to
strike disease two thousand
nineteen.
Okay.
That will support.
This one.
And then I think also on page
two lines eight and nine prices
were just going over to conform
eighty nine same such
initiatives very well so on page
eight our our outside page two
line eight before Corona virus
and and insert severe acute
respiratory syndrome after
coronavirus the number two
online line strike disease two
thousand nineteen.
How do we get all we get all.
And then
okay so let's let's deal with.
With a look at it because it is
growing to disease protocol for
not talking about the yes okay.
Okay so.
This is.
Okay so the time was fine.
So I have them the changes that
we made on page two lines eight
and nine.
Line eleven.
Line eighteen.
Line twenty.
Line twenty two and twenty
three.
At line twenty five all of which
are the same.
prior to the work corona virus
inserting severe acute
respiratory syndrome after the
report of virus inserting the
number two and striking is these
two thousand nineteen.
I get that right okay is there
so on motion from Senator Moores
second from Senator Stewart is
there any discussion.
Is there any objection.
In the local Senator.
Senator Ingle.
Senator Lopez.
Senator Moores yes Senator
o'neill.
Senator Ortiz Y. Pino yes
Senator Stewart.
Senator Wirth yes Senator do it
yes in.
Yes ma'am that passes and it's
good to know some rumors that he
was against your stuff to.
And the second the issue is on
page two one thirteen.
Let's to someone from the
pharmacopeia healthier I don't
believe they do all truthfully
to to provide close contacts I'm
not sure actually do that.
Those concerns with beginning of
the pandemic between the
previous administrations CDC
this administration
So I think that's what we could
get the public health issue in
there all the national park.
That did get disconnected.
The CDC data.
At the stories page.
Issues.
This will be testing and we're
what we consulting with
businesses we will full we
constituted that the CDC
guidelines which change from
time to time and eternity
Department
you know the extension of the
checklist Center do that here Mr
chair I I remember the
conversation we adopted the
small session we had
specifically chosen them because
at that time on New Mexico that.
The definitions reviews all the
delay.
We're I think more restrictions
than those of the CDC and we
wanted to use those that higher
standard.
I mean if it's if it's not the
case anymore the that the delay
just as it has no definition on
this that and that that would
certainly be a change but we
have that very specifically
chosen that language last
session rather than the CDC
language so I think we should
confirm whether that we could we
could maybe we should check with
Dr Scrase always text number of
different issues and just see if
other actually that it would
change on the floor okay.
That's a simple change to make
if we need to do that.
And
And I do.
As you but talking about it at I
do recall that that there was a
period of time where we weren't
sure how much the CDC believed
in science
at one point so what we're
Department of Health but that
may have changed.
So
if we if we get some clarity on
that that we can make the change
or.
what not in the meantime okay in
that case is there anything else
on the screen.
For us to deal with at this time
Senator Wirth is here just to
see really I would suggest that
we put this in the form of a
rules of.
Background and the generalized
in the real hard contract for
and I just need to ask that
that.
And so I don't know whether it
needs to be a motion to that
effect or how you doing however
you like to do it I just think
when it comes to the floor since
we've really clean this up and
narrowed it down.
Exactly product on the floor.
To do that with that Mr
Fleetwood over his objections
sitting here so
It'll be able to to proceed with
that right away along with Mr
hill and so yes so in that case
I'll be looking for a motion for
do not pass on a point two two
one five four seven point two
and a do pass on Senate rules
committee substitute for Senate
resolution number one.
Thank Senator Wirth second from
Senator Moores.
Any further discussion.
Very well and that case is going
to Senator Baca.
Senator Ingle yes Senator Lopez.
Senator Moores yes Senator
o'neill.
Senator Ortiz Y. Pino yes
Senator Stewart.
Senator Wirth.
Senator yes and senator yes
ma'am.
So on a vote of how many how
many.
Ten to one that nine one.
Six thank you nine one.
