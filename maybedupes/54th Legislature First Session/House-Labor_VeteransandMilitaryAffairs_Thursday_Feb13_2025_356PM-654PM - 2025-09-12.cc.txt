Test.
Excuse me, Landon. Can
you uh, unmute yourself
for a second? Yes.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Ok.
>> Ok. If they were
in the way through
and
it
so increasingly
1000
and
I'll,
I'll,
you
know,
I
this
so,
and
I,
hey, buddy, what are you doing?
You change those tires on
that?
All right, you might not in the
office
that
the number 527,
777.
And they
bring
it.
You guys are the best
thing.
Seven. >> We good.
Ok. >> She
was
c
>> yeah,
um madam chair.
I think we're um, we're
good on Zoom
and the first. So
we're gonna go ahead and get
started.
We're gonna go to, uh,
questions from the committee
representative
Mejia.
Yes, please
>> madam
chair.
Let me see if I remember
how I ask the
question. In
addition to the,
uh, the impact
this minimum wage
increase will have
on small
businesses,
on service
industries. How
this will impact state
funded groups like
childcare
facilities
and Medicaid
providers.
>> Thank you. Um,
madam chair and, and representative,
as I was saying, I
think overall,
um, whenever
we increase
or provide more
money for our workforce,
it has a positive impact
So it's a positive impact from
my perspective and
it's across the board.
Um we
improve uh
employee retention
because by
nature of the fact that they're going
to work for
a, a higher
rate of pay, we
improve productivity.
It's a boost in productivity.
Um I think
overall my
sentiment is, and this
is my belief that we
increase a better
quality of living, which
in my view is very
important when you have
um when you
have a living
wage, when you have
benefits, when
you have
um peace of mind
and not having to
struggle with two or
three jobs.
Um or, and we
have employees
that are working in the industry
in the areas that you
referenced. Um Madam
Chair and Representative
that still have
households that
are living together, multiple
families living together. And
although they are in those
service programs
and although they are
in those professions that
were articulated
and that you just raised,
there are still multiple
families living together that
have to work
multiple jobs in order
to help support even
those positions.
So overall, I
think it's a um
uh a way in which to
reduce the reliance on
social programs,
it circulates more money
in the economy.
And despite what
others
have articulated,
it really doesn't lead to a
mass exodus of families.
We saw Madam chair
and Representative during uh
COVID. Now we
saw a lot of small
businesses finding the
way especially
and I like to articulate this
our Hispanic serving, I mean,
our businesses that are
Hispanic found a way.
Um the tire
shops, the small restaurants,
um the small mom
and pop stores
and they found a way by
everyone pitching in.
So it
leads to
um overall what I
just mentioned in
terms of productivity
retention. Um
and they have
our workforce as a
way to
measure
what they can
expect on a
regular basis
and strive
um to
live
minimally still
within those parameters.
So for me, it's, it's an
important uh way
to address
all of that.
>> Thank you for that answer, madam
chair. Um
One more question
um Madam, vice
chair and madam
chair um
will the budget
increase for them
for the child care
facilities or state
funded
madam check
>> um Madam chair and
representative
with all of our
um
increase us. Uh
We have to
consider all budgets have
to consider.
Uh Obviously we're
not asking any
appropriations
from the
budget, so to
speak, which why, which is why
we put in a date
of effective date
so that everyone that's
affected every employer
that's affected will
have until January
of 2027.
Um to
plan to
prepare
to um
do whatever is necessary
in order to be able
to
um
provide this
increase in the minimum
wage. And then
thereafter, it's, it's like
with anything else when you're
running a business,
um you have your,
you create AAA
budget,
you allow
for cost of
operations and
this is the cost of operations.
So um
there we're allowing for the
effective date to be at that point
so that everyone
has a chance to
uh
be prepared to
prepare for
it.
>> Thank you madam chair. One
more question. What
about madam vice
chair? Um
What about the people
that are on
snap?
Um
The federal um
poverty guidelines, are
they gonna change
madam chair?
>> Uh madam chair
representative.
The hope is
that by
increasing the minimum
wage to a
higher wage,
$17
and then indexing
indexing it
thereafter.
Um There will
be less of a
reliance
on um social
services and
public programs.
I don't know
every the formula changes
at the federal level for qual for
eligibility, it
changes on a regular level
of basis. So I don't
know uh what those
guidelines are are
at this time. Um
However,
there ii I think
the bigger question or the
bigger way in which
we can look at this is
that I don't
think necessarily
that um our
workforce
by providing living wages,
adequate benefits
um living benefits
because we, we've been
talking about that all
since the, the committee
hearing began,
um our
population, our
workforce uh
would become less and
less reliant on social
programs and that's the intent
because we want
individual families to
have quality of living
and individuals want
to work. Um
And
this is a way in which we
can uh reduce
the cost on social programs
but also afford
uh quality of living for our
population, for our working
families. So that's
really important. But I can answer
your question directly in terms of
how that would affect the eligibility
requirements because that's
a fluid um
change and that's not in our
control of the
state.
>> Thank you madam chair. And
uh one more question, don't
you think I increasing
the minimum wage
to $17?
Probably some families
are gonna be just in the
limbo right there for
benefits,
>> madam >> chair >> and madam chair
and representative. I really,
I, I don't know because
I don't have
um for a family
of four, I don't know what that means.
For a family of two. I don't know what
that means. Uh I
wouldn't be able to answer that
question. That would be an eligibility
question relevant
to um
what, what they
uh what those guidelines
are and I don't have those
guidelines in front of me. So I really
don't know how to answer
that
>> madam chair. Thank you.
I don't have no more questions. Thank
you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative. We're gonna go
next to >> uh Representative
Hall.
>> Thank you madam, vice chair,
madam chair.
Um
18 years ago, we were
below the national
average
on
uh
wages,
you know where we're at as a
state on the national
average now for the
minimum wages, madam,
vice chair madam, chair
>> um
vice chair and
representative, if I can call
on my expert witness
who is with the national conference
of state legislators,
uh, to help with that
response.
Uh, Mr Janel,
will you? >> Yes, I,
I'm happy
to, to comment.
Um, I don't know
the exact ranking off the
top of my head. Uh,
but it would probably
be around, there's 34
states and territories
in, including
DC that
have a f that have
a minimum wage above the federal
minimum. Um,
$12 is on
the lower end
of those. Uh, I
would probably have to
guess that New Mexico is right
around 25
or 24 in
the, in the country right
now. Um
For the
minimum
wage
currently the highest
minimum wage is
in uh Washington
DC with
1750 for
states, the highest
is California and Washington
State at around
1650.
>> Thank you. I'm sorry, madam,
vice chair, um
madam chair.
So with
that in mind and there's
34 states who
codified
this.
Um
I then look at the fact
we took
agriculture, put this
into it
and a and a moment ago, madam
chair, you said that we're, we're gonna
get businesses and people a couple
of years, Mike. How does, how
does the agricultural indus
industry prepare
uh or something like
this when they're dealing with factors,
they can't predict
disease, uh
drought,
whatever else comes down
the road. Madam
chair, madam Boy's
chair,
>> uh vice and,
and um representative,
I think it's important to
note that um
we were working within the parameters
of the state laws that
existed in the
language. And as
you know, uh
when we work within
the state laws
in preparing our
legislation, we have to take
into consideration
um several factors
and because I
wanted to exempt
uh agriculture workers
and have them,
uh, be able
to receive a minimum wage.
We had to correct
the language in the
law as it was because
the law currently
um referred
to uh peace
work. And
in order for the agriculture
workers to be able to
receive a minimum
wage, um
they would have to be
classified in several
different ways. And
so for uh for
me, just as
a principle, a
matter of values
and principles,
um I don't,
I don't ever
um want to
reduce the value
of our
workers across the
board, whether they're
agricultural workers or
whether they are tip workers
or whatever. I think
every worker has a
right to a living wage
and a right to benefits.
So
when
we realized that
we had to make these
uh certain
changes within the state
law in
my view. And as
under my direction, as
the sponsor of this bill,
I felt it was important
to uh completely
remove that section in the
state law so that they could
qualify. And
I don't know how to answer
that. I come from uh
madam vice chair
and representative. I do
come from a family that are,
have long agricultural
history in Donan County.
Long, I mean several
generations. And
I know I also
um know from a farmworker
perspective,
um how
difficult uh
and sometimes
um
unimaginable
it is to be
a agricultural worker in
the fields. And
for me, uh as I
stated, I
believe that
no matter what business you're
in, whether it's the agricultural
business, the dairy
business, whatever
a restaurant business, whatever
business we're in, we
must
value the
very
workforce that is
the backbone of our business.
And so that is
a long way to get to that answer.
But that is
um what I provided for
in this piece of
legislation.
>> Thank you, madam, vice chair
madam chair.
Whenever we, we
raise the
living wages for these
individuals, we also have to,
won't that cause an
increase.
You know, if for instance,
they maybe have a retirement
plan, their cost of
paying it is certainly
in the social security
contributions and and then
potentially taxes.
We've taken that into
consideration. Mature
madam meister,
>> madam meister and
representative. It's
like any
other base of
operation.
Um It is a cost
factor that must
be factored
in to doing
business. This is
what doing business is.
You have to factor in
your salaries, you have to factor
in your benefits, you have to factor
in the social security
contributions that are
made by the employer.
You have to factor all these
things and what you do
as a business because I've also
been a, a small business
owner and I've had to
factor in all of those
things and be able to
adjust my day to
day operations in order
to be able to uh
adequately.
First of all, take care of the
employees, take care
of the benefits of the employees
receive and then be
able to um
estimate how much
um operating
costs it's gonna take to run
my business and then
proceed
with setting
whatever the prices are, whatever
has to happen in order to be able
to make it work. So yes,
the answer is yes, it's gonna affect
all of that. But there's
a way in which
um
there's no valid argument
in my perspective, in my
viewpoint
that should
in any way,
um create a business
opportunity or run
a business operation
on the backs of our
employees, the employees
should be first and foremost,
and that's just my
fundamental um
value system and
principles. And so
again, as small
business owner having come from
a family along a family
with an agricultural
business, I understand
that. And if that means
that I have to make adjustments as
the owner, then that's what I
do. And that's just a fundamental
difference in our viewpoints
of madam, vice chair
representative.
>> Thank you, madam chair, madam, vice
chair.
Um
>> Yes,
I'm happy to
um talk
about it. If possible,
I would love to show a map
of the states that that do
have it. I feel like that would just be a good
visual representation.
Um I
just need access
to do that. Um
But there are 22
states that do
um tie
their minimum wage to the consumer
price index.
Um They vary
slightly uh some
states.
Uh oh,
don't know if I can share
anyway, some states,
uh,
do, like cap
their, um,
increase. Uh,
California caps theirs
to 3.5%.
Vermont, um, caps theirs
to 5%
maximum
every year based on,
um, the consumer
price index.
Uh, it's worth noting that
Colorado and Arizona,
um, two neighboring states
do not, uh, cap
their minimum wage increases
on the,
uh, consumer price
index.
Um, additionally, only
one state
has, uh,
had
their, uh, minimum
wage tied to
inflation and
removed that. And that was
Nevada. Um,
and the reasoning for that it was a
ballot measure,
um, where
it removed the
cost of living
adjustment as well as
they used to have a two tier
system for minimum wage.
So voters were voting on both
the cost of living
and a
unique minimum
wage system.
So,
outside of that it's, there
have been no other states that have removed
it. Um
Additionally, according
to, um, let
me see if I can pull up the,
uh,
research
organization again.
Um,
but these cost of
living adjustments tend
to, uh, not
increase inflation
drastically.
Um, especially
because they are more
expected and known that they're
coming every year rather
than large
surprise, uh, minimum wage
increases. That
may
more likely increase
inflation.
Mm.
Yeah. So there's 34
that have, um, wages
above the federal minimum and
then 22 of those
states, um,
tie their increases
to AC
P I
annually.
New Mexico is in that
12 that does
not
Industry to
compete.
And that, that, that's without
getting so deep. And I know I'm going
through this because I want to go fast. Madam
vice chair, chair, I'm trying to do
this quickly.
Um This is why they're
supposed to be exempt. But
as you go through your bill, madam
Vice chair, it's so
massive. It's so broad.
You included
nonprofits,
you included nonprofits, you
included churches, you
included you, I
mean, there are no exemptions
or very little exemptions
that I saw madam vice
chair, uh
madam chair.
Um you
took out
educational. So that
means it
ii I take
that as public
schools uh
charitable, religious
nonprofit, these are all were
exempt, are no longer
exempt,
agriculture,
uh seasonal workers.
I mean, you just keep going through
here without me going
through through every single thing
here. It's a
massive
shift of
how they, they have to a
adjust their
budgets.
If this passes madam
Vice Churcher,
we have a
200
since 2019,
we have, we will have raised
the minimum wage by
230%.
It's leaving, there's nothing left on the
table anymore. That was
chair, chair,
we're compressed our our customers
cannot afford
the, the goods and services that we're already
providing and that
yet we're compressing.
We're pushing it to squeezing
them out of business.
That's why they're in, in line
here. Meow vice chair
chair. Because we have,
we were to the compression
system and then we think,
well, why did they stay in business? I heard
one for their employers meow vice chair
chair.
It's not just for that.
What if you worked out your whole entire
life and you paid for
that? That is the equipment
facility, buildings,
your whole life's
investment is in that restaurant
or whatever, they're
hanging on for dear life.
Then we add the
already problems that they
have for those of you who are
not aware of how,
how uh, loans
are, are made when
or commercial loans are handled
by the vice chair.
They, they have usually
a five year call at the
maximum.
They generally now because of the,
because in, in interest has
gone up so fast. They're now
in two year calls, three year calls.
What does that mean for those of you that may
not understand that means
it's not fixed like your, your
home. When you buy, you buy a home and
you get, get a fixed rate,
it's, it's fixed for 30
years or 20 years or 15 years,
it's fixed for
2345
years and then they call your
loan because things are changing
so much, adding more
pressure.
So you know, I hope
that, that, that,
um,
rather than sitting here
and going back and
forth. But I
will let me finish
before I finish
that.
Our minimum wage win. Vice
chair, chair
is above 31 states. It's
ranked 31.
In other words, we're 31
highest from
the 50. There's only
19 more that are higher than
us yet. We're the
most, 11 of the most POed
states
and the reimbursement rates.
When you come to, we, we heard some
of the me on the medical side, we
don't have the reimbursement rates.
We don't have to, we don't have
to force
minimum wage uh
law
to CRE create that
to, to, to get them to pay
more because they can't, hasn't
been raised since 2007, the
Medicare rates. So
they're already compressed more.
So I'm not
sure. And on the
other hand, we, we have bills saying
that we have to have minimum staffing
situations. This
is such, such a
conflict, a
massive conflict, madam,
vice chair,
chair,
you're a good person,
madam madam chair.
I know you're trying to do the, the
best thing for, for,
for your constituents in the state
of New Mexico.
Unfortunately, this
is, is very, very
difficult to
be able to absorb
by our state.
Um
As far as the tip
credit,
I would say
madam vice chair chair,
we're giving them a pay
cut by
passing
this.
I just went to breakfast this morning. It
cost me $40.02 of
us. And I didn't
order anything massive. It was
like, it was just
a AAA little breakfast
sandwich. Couple small.
It was 20 bucks, 20 bucks
each. Roughly by the time I got
my tea and a
coffee,
we give them about
15 20%. We'll just
round it up to 20. If you're really
generous, minimized
share and a person. And
I was II, I turned
that table in about 30 minutes
because by the time they, I sat there,
they paid, they ga gave my
food and I, and I
walked in and walked out because I had to come
back to the floor.
It's 30 minutes
and you know,
that gentleman made
$8 of a
tip.
And so madam chair,
chair,
he had about
five tables at the same
time.
I don't know how much they order, but it was a
couple of people. So I, I think I
would say that I would be fine
to say that most
of these, these
um uh service
workers are making anywhere from
25 to $40
a an
hour.
And so this would be a
pay cut to them.
Um
I'm sorry that we find ourselves in this
situation where we're, I, I don't like
it. I'm gonna be honest with you, I'm gonna
voice your chair. We're
big
republicans on one end and
parties. I don't like that
stuff. I think we need to do what
we just did in the last Bill
or we understand the
impact that it has
on the entire,
uh, state of New Mexico
and how it just, how it
stifles,
um, businesses, they
are stressed out. It is
difficult. They're seeing
that people from outside
do not want to come and invest here
when they see things like this, when they
see and New
Mexico Manor Life Church
here has increased their minimum
wage by 230%.
I don't know who, who's gonna wanna come
over here. I mean, what, what's
next? So,
you know,
um
I, I just, rather than me
going through the, through
the grilling deal of
back and forth and, and
hearing all these things,
I think though
madam Vice Church here, you do have
an opportunity to answer some of the statement
that I made because I just
don't wanna
um,
uh
I don't want to beat the committee up
in, in this where
we, I just laid out my statement. And
so do you have any, do
you have anything to say over all those
things that I just said, Madam Vice Stuart
chair,
>> madam, vice chair
and um
representative,
I think I see it
and I see, I see it
as a matter of pride for our
state
that we are taking
a major steps
to ensure that we're breaking
the cycle of poverty.
That to me is a
huge major
uh, step forward
and we can say,
oh, that we're doing
that and we can,
and so we can stop
saying that we're 30
something or 40 something
or 50 something in the,
in relationship
to all of the negative
aspects. I
think I see it as AAA
real strong sense of
pride. I do not
see companies
wanting to come in, uh,
not wanting to come into
our state. Uh,
because we have a high minimum
wage, they're wanting to come to our state
because up until
now they see us as a cheap
labor state or
as a way to continue to
further exploit our
workforce. That is
not the kind of business that I
want to see or
attract. I'm an
developer by career,
that would be something that I would
not want to
attract. So I
think that you've made all
the valid arguments for us to
have a better
wage. Uh Vice
chair and Representative, I think
it's a sense of pride. I
think we don't know what to
expect either.
Uh when it comes
to uh the federal
government and
entitlement programs and
social security
and all types of
other things that uh
education
um that have
been threatened to, to be
cut back on. I think
that we have, um
Also I mentioned
earlier, we have households
that have um two
and three families working
for two and three jobs
just to pay the
rent if we want to
address chronic
homelessness. If we want to
address all of
the um
social
economic
results of having
being a high poverty
state. Then,
then we want, then we
don't want this.
I think the other way around
you've articulated
uh vice chair and
representative a sense
of pride.
Uh I think the
sense of pride and I would
see no problem in,
in, in reference to the
tip employees. Nothing in
this bill
prohibits temp employees
from receiving tips.
Nothing, nothing in this
bill does that, all it
does is it guarantees a
minimum wage the
same with agricultural workers.
It guarantees a minimum
wage. We
want, my
intent is for us to
quit being viewed
as an attraction
by, to large industry
and large corporations
because we have
um, a cheap
labor force, quote-unquote.
That's not my quote, but that's
the quote and an
easy in, in order to
make a quick buck. And
I think that we need to stop
breaking. We need to start breaking
that outlook of our
state and,
and
restore a sense of
pride in our
workforce.
>> Vice chair, Vice
Mr Chair.
The thing
is
lot of us
employers. We do
our best to try and we
treat our, our, our employees
first.
I can tell you that
we,
the people that are employing these
people, especially in small
businesses are the ones
that have to stay working late
Saturdays, Sundays
nights evenings, my
kids had to had
to stay, uh, on
the couch, falling asleep when
doing their homework in our
lobby because my wife and
I would work till
midnight.
This is what I mean, minimized
chair, chair.
And when we talk about
tips going from
$3.50 to
$17 an hour.
That's five employees.
I mean, so we're just
gonna see like what I saw in,
uh, I think it was in Santa Teresa
in your area
where I went to
a restaurant
vice chair, chair and there was a little,
a little robot thing
that they put it on there and I just drove
right over there and came to my, I
didn't even know what was going on, showed
up with a tray of food because that's what we're
gonna probably see and you're gonna see
people checking themselves
out like we already are at Walmart
and all kinds of places because they're
trying to, to adjust for all
these things. We're,
we're here again with me, vice
chair chair.
We said the same
argument you raised
it already uh,
in those four years by 100 and
60%. We're in the
same boat. We were
back then because this
is the base
of, of,
of
cost in
doing business. You
raise a base, you,
it waive
it, it, that, that way
runs through everything
and being that, that is
the case. It's great
for the first three months. And then
everyone adjust their
prices and adjust their,
their situation
as businesses because they
can't afford to keep paying that.
And, and then we find
ourselves matter by,
we find ourselves in the same boat
we are today and we'll net
we'll be chasing our
tail running around trying to
make this thing. And
so, and I, and as far as
homelessness and, and
our youth, we need to work
on, on,
on mental
by your here
on
them. Understanding.
Uh Well, the
youth
how to
financial literacy,
reading,
mathematics,
pride in going to
work.
I tell my kids, madam Vice
church here, I tell my kids,
you guys live in a world
today that if you're a hard worker
and you are, you are gonna
do you, you take care of your business
at, at work, you're gonna move up
the ladder, you're gonna be
successful. And I want my
Children and I, they know
better that I want them
to be able to sustain. I want to know
that my kid can drive. I can
pass away. Something happens to
me and they can
survive. I want
survivors.
That is my because I want my
Children to be able to,
to sustain themselves and they
all have done well
doing that. And
so um Mayor Vice
chair, I don't, I don't want to go on
any more about it. But um
thank you for the time that I
had and I hope this
committee considers what I
said. Um
and, and, and being all
the things that we heard earlier. Thank
you, Mayor Vice
chair,
madam, vice chair, >> I move
a due pass of house bill 246
as amended. Do we have a 2nd
2nd? >> Thank
you.
Yes. Oh, I'm
sorry, I didn't know that
you
did.
Thank you madam chair and thank you
representative,
oh,
um for your
presentation.
Um,
and kind of your,
um,
your starchs in terms of
really trying to,
to, uh, get more
for our state
minimum wage
employees.
Um, which
I think is about 250,000
people, if I'm
mistaken.
No, the, the, the number
of
our
number of our state
minimum wage employees
and I'm sure is at
approximately
250,000
individuals.
>> Uh, vice chair and
representative,
if that is what you're
saying, I don't know the exact
number but it is
what you are referring
to. >> Thank
you, madam chair.
Um,
you know, this issue of minimum
wage, um,
has always been
contentious.
Um,
I know that the,
and chairman
when Governor Johnson
was, I was,
uh, uh,
Garrett Johnson was
governor.
Um,
and his term ended
in 2022.
Our,
he was not about to sign
any legislation
that dealt with the
minimum wage
increases.
That's why I carry the
constitutional amendment
to put it on the ballot.
And naturally it passed
the house, but it didn't make it to the
Senate. And this is
approximately back in
2000,
uh, 2001,
somewhere in there. You
know, the current, uh,
federal state minimum
wage is at $7.25
an hour.
And, uh,
some of these exemptions
that are in, in current
law manager.
Um, basically
I have to meet that
minimum in terms
of the employer. That's
not to say that the
dairies and the chili
processors
are paying
$7.25.
I would think they're not.
Um,
but, uh, madam chair,
it's also important to understand
that, uh,
in
2007,
when we raised the minimum wage from
515 to
$7.50
those were kind of a
two,
uh, considerations
that went into
being able to
achieve a
$7.50
wage.
And what was that
by exempting dairies
and by exempting chili
processors?
So that's how goes,
uh, workforces
work sectors,
manager came
to be exempted.
Not that I personally like
that,
but that was part of the
process of
getting some of the senate
to move to
$7.50
of which they were not going
to if we didn't
have those exemptions
in terms of the chili processors,
uh, and the
dairies
and, uh,
you know, madam chair,
um
I think what businesses
want,
uh, is they want a
minimum wage bill
that is time and
price specific.
So I think it,
but that is fair in
terms of arriving
at that
time and price
specific.
And, uh,
and that's what we did madam
chair in the
2019
legislation.
And actually, I was one of the
chief sponsors
of that legislation
and
that legislation initially,
madam chair was
real target
specific,
raising the minimum wage to
$12 an hour
incrementally
and four
years, three
years.
Um
and also
it started off
mana
of uh
making the state minimum
wage, the minimum
wage was stated
for
employees.
And naturally madam
chair, that one particular
issue
um
brought in
hordes of
opposition from
the uh
restaurant
association
and manage chair.
The other element that was
in that real targeted bill
was
indexing
uh using
CP I in terms of
indexing
uh
to where again, we
have a time specific price
specific
approach in terms of
what that would
mean.
So that 4% seemed real
reasonable. And
actually, that brought the Restaurant
Association
in, in terms of
supporting that indexing
bill naturally didn't
make it out of the commerce committee.
But that
showed that the Restaurant
Association is willing
to really
do for the working class,
especially the minimum wage
earners if it,
if it's something
reasonable.
The other thing, madam chair,
that is really important
that this legislation doesn't
consider
yes,
an element that
Representative Dow is going to bring
forth with, with the,
the next bill
in regards
to
contractors.
And in that
2019
legislation
I adopted, I,
I took a floor
amendment from
Representative Dow
that basically stated
that if we do any changes to
minimum wage,
that there will be a
AAA orderly
rate increase
to the state
contractors.
And that was fair. That
was a fair thing to do
because in,
in, in time memorial,
every time we do a minimum wage
increase, we don't
consider that
workforce.
So what ends up happening is that
those providers have to eat
up the increase
and usually that means cutting
services.
So that was a fair thing to
do madam
chair. And
um, you know,
uh in conclusion,
because I don't want to belabor the
point madam chair.
But
the legislation before
us is
real significant in what it's
trying to do, but it's
still overreaching.
I think it just goes beyond
the nature of what we're
capable to do,
you know,
um
on February of
2025
and there's got to
be a more momentum
madam chair also from the
grassroots that
stands behind this
initiative
and most important, there's got to
be buy in by the
governor in terms of
any initiative that we
do that
regards minimum rate
increases.
And you know, madam
chair
um
and,
and madam chair
for VCA Valero
um
vote for this piece of
legislation,
but I
really don't support the
substance
in the way that it's
overreaching
and uh
uh but out of
respect for you as a chair of this
committee,
I kind of feel
that I have to
honor your role
and vote for this,
but I definitely
feel
that
that it's not what we should be
doing
madam chair at this point in
time.
Thank
you.
>> Representative Hall.
Yes.
Representative
Johnson,
Representative
Mejia.
Yes.
Representative Ortez.
Not a
table.
>> We are, there was a tabling
motion. A tabling
motion takes precedence over
the uh motion for a due
pass.
Ok.
>> Representative Reeb
Yes to
table.
Representative
Terrazas.
Representative Torres
Velazquez,
no
vice chair uh
Chavez.
No
terrible Royval Caballero
>> not to
table
uh 6 to 4 vote. The
tabling motion
fails. We are back
on the motion for a
due pass
clerk to call the
roll.
>> Representative Anaya.
Yes, for passage.
Representative
Garcia.
Representative Hall.
Oh,
Chavez.
>> Yes. To pass
>> Chairman Royval
Caballero. >> Yes, to
pass
>> madam chair by a vote to six
before you have a due
pass.
>> Thank you, vice chair and
committee.
Thank everybody for your
patience.
We are
now on
House Bill
305,
I believe. Representative down
and Representative Miguel
Garcia
is
you may begin at any time.
Yeah, it's very low. That's why I had to
change chairs.
I don't know what
happens.
>> I'll use the home health
care providers as an example.
They, um, I think their
reimbursement rates around $18
an hour out
of that, they've got to pay
for the service.
They also have to pay for the transportation.
They have to pay for software
compliance insurance.
We require that they have
a administrator
within the
area. And
so when, if you add a
minimum wage increase, which we
very may well, and if you
add pay family medical
leave, that could
raise their cost for one
hour of care easily
over $30. That's
just one
of our
folks providing services.
And what's interesting is
the people who are, are
contractors,
whether they are for profit or not for
the profit, many of them are not for
profit. They're providing
the services to our most vulnerable
populations. It's our senior
mill sites. It's the Mills on
Wheels. These are the
folks that we're not fully
funding. These are the
folks that are having a hard time
surviving.
And so I guess I'll
turn it over to, to
my cosponsor to fill in whatever
he thinks is left on
that.
>> Go
ahead,
go ahead, >> present
the bill. Ok. So this
is,
>> did I do have a frozen
screen again? I'm
sorry. So if you don't
mind, put
in your um
microphone
off. Ok. And we're while we
work on it. Thank
you.
I think you should order for
every
>> test, test
test.
So for everyone's
information, uh
particularly the
sponsors of the bill,
we're, we've got the system
going, but
it's um there's no
guarantee that we won't have
breaks. So,
pardon it? If I
stop you again. Thank
you. >> Thank you, madam
chair. I'll just keep this brief. So,
so the purpose of House Bill
305, this
is requiring
that public contracts
provided that we
provide for the increased
contractor and
subcontractor reimbursement and
workforce wage
increases
in accordance with the
state minimum wage increases or increased
costs by mandated law. So if we
mandate it
and the, and the, and we are
their sole source. These are people who can't
charge a difference for their fees,
that we also cover the cost because
we don't want to supplant or
lose capacity.
So this would make sure that we
do
that.
>> And I think with that we stand for
questions. I think
uh uh represent
do kind of included uh
how this concept
originally started
off with that 2019
piece of legislation that was
incorporated. This language is
incorporated into
the Senate Bill upon
a, a floor
amendment.
>> Thank you. So we
will go now to
um Zoom
and see if there's anyone
in opposition to House Bill
305305
A we able
to
no one period.
Ok? And we go
to the audience, anyone
here in opposition that
wishes to speak against
the HB
305.
All right. So we
have no one else on Zoom. So we're
gonna go ahead and proceed with all
those in favor of
HP
305
and I see a show of hands.
Ok. So those of you
that are in favor if you lined
up and
what for you?
>> Good afternoon madam, chair
members of the committee. My name is
Vicente Vargas.
I'm with the New Mexico Health Care
Association, New
Mexico Center for assisted
Living. We
represent
64 of the 68
nursing facilities in New
Mexico. We
represent over 100 assisted
living facilities in New
Mexico and all
six of the intermediate care
facilities for individuals with
developmental disabilities
in New Mexico.
We appreciate the sponsor bringing
this legislation
given
that
nursing homes,
64% of
on average 67%
of their residents are on
Medi our Medicaid
beneficiaries and
100% of
clients in
intermediate care facilities
for individuals with development of the
dis disabilities are
Medicaid beneficiaries.
Therefore, any
raises uh
any minimum wage increases,
for example, PFML A
as well
impact the
revenue that
these Medicaid
providers rely
on to deliver the
care to their
clients and their
residents if there
is no offset
or a, a state
mandated minimum
wage or
other expense
you, you're taking from a
uh from a Medicaid
rate. Um
for example, for nursing
facilities that hasn't
been um
adjusted for
costs for today's
costs since
2007.
Therefore, we're, they're
nine overall $90
million
in the whole,
with, uh, with the,
with uh what it costs to
provide care and nursing
facilities. This
is, this legislation
will help offset
those negative impacts
that are placed on Medicaid
rates and Medicaid providers.
So we urge your support. Thank
you,
>> madam, chair members of the
committee. My name is Megan
Lorino and I'm the executive
director for the New Mexico
Association for Home
and hospice care.
Our providers contract
with managed care organizations
to provide care in the home
to New Mexico Medicaid
beneficiaries.
We stand in strong support
of house bill 305.
Each year, our providers
and myself and our lobbyists are
here in their own house
trying to get our rates adjusted
to recognize the cost
to provide care here in New
Mexico. But each
year we are left further and
further behind.
We just had a long discussion
about the about a minimum
wage bill and for our personal
care service providers,
Representative Dow talked
a little bit about this, but
from 2019 to
2023
that time period where our
minimum wage increased from
750 to $12.
The cost for our providers
actually increased by
$7.46
an hour to provide
care. But
meanwhile, our rate
increased just by
$4.11.
So there was a really big
gap of about
$3.55
whole each hour that
care was provided.
I know that we there was
some discussion about well,
businesses find a
way and
this was just happened
to be an unprecedented time in
history where I
know our providers. And I think a
lot of New Mexico businesses
found relief from a
unscheduled
and devastating public health
emergency that
provided federal relief
in lots of ways to our
state. And that is
how we are still standing.
And our provider network was not
devastated.
The state rec has
recognized the cost of the increased
minimum wage but but they
continue to forget the
other costs such as corresponding
increases in FICA social
security, unemployment
taxes, workers comp
um not to mention
increased overhead cost
or statutory benefits
such as the paid sick
level.
>> Good afternoon madam, chair members of the
committee, I'm Jim Copeland, the executive
director of the Association of
Developmental Disabilities Community
Providers. We represent
31 provider agencies
throughout the state of New Mexico
who provide developmental disabilities
waiver services. Those services
are reimbursed at 100%
of the Medicaid rate.
Uh In the past, the providers
have absorbed the healthy New
Mexico Workplace Act. There was no
increase in the rate to provide
that service. We've
been absorbed the the
state minimum wage increases.
And we would love to thank
Representative Dow
and Representative Garcia for
bringing house Bill 305
forward. It will be an answer to
the prayers of DD
providers to be able
to have this
automatic increase uh
paid for by the state of
New Mexico. So we would request
your support of house Bill
305. Thank
you
>> madam, chair members of the committee
Carter Bundy with a me, we
stand in support of this bill for
a couple of reasons. The first is
every time we do try to raise the
minimum wage, this is
one of the most significant and
I think legitimate
causes of concern because
when you have the government
specifically reimbursing
organizations and then they
don't increase it when they have a
additional mandates in the minimum
wage, it really puts people
who are doing great work in a
bind and this is really
important work and usually
the main people objecting to
minimum wage increases.
Um In addition to restaurants
and hospitality are
people who do provide these
incredibly important health
services. Um And the second
reason is
I'm not gonna be a hypocrite. We
believe in minimum
wage for everyone. And we
think that if we're asking
other people to pay it, the state should
pay it as well, both for state
employees and for people who
it is directly reimbursing. So
with that, we hope you'll support the bill
and thank the
sponsors,
>> members of the committee. My
name is Kim Lagan. I'm the regis
registered lobbyist for the New
Mexico Childcare and Education
Association. There are
about 1000 childcare
providers across the state.
On average
childcare centers serve
about 70% of
families receiving child care
assistance as the
legislature makes the changes
to wage and other
required benefits.
This will, this bill
will offer security to
providers like childcare.
So thanks to the sponsors
for bringing this
forward.
>> Thank you.
Um
Was that? Oh, I saw
somebody stand up. Sorry, I thought
I thought she was standing up.
Thank you.
So, um now we're
on uh back to the
committee with any
questions,
Representative
Terrazas and
building the list.
So just let us know. Thank
you. >> Thank you
madam chair. Thank you uh
representatives for bringing
this forward did a good
job earlier in, in,
in expla
explaining how this worked.
So I don't have a lot of questions and I
I kind of read and understand this
pretty well. Um
But representatives madam
chair representatives does this
in any way shape or form cover
school meals?
>> Um madam chair
and, and representative, if you
mean the increased wages
for the staff who provide
the school lunches,
this doesn't apply to that because
they are a state employee and we always
cover the cost for state employees.
So if you were looking at the public education
department budget, um
they would make an adjustment for
the minimum wage, they would make an
adjustment for the paid family
medical leave. But this
would apply to
a USDA D A
mill. That's at
any of these nursing homes, assisted
living veterans
home. That's a department of health
run facility. So they would
have it requested in the state
employee budget. It would be in the
doh budget but
for the contractors, it would not
cover. So if, if
you, I'm trying to think of places that
serve USA mills,
childcare centers, senior
mill sites, um
nursing homes, assisted living,
hospice, anyone who's serving a
USDA mill that is not
state operated,
this would help them. But
that my point
is that we cover
it for the people who get the check from the
state, we cover their benefits.
We cover the cost of the mandates
but only for those who are
paid that are state or
county employees.
>> Madam, chair representative. I think
this is great because it, we
pass so many bills that
or so much legislation
sometimes that stifles
some of these agencies
un funded. And I think this
is, this is a good way to
kind of level the playing
field.
Do you agree with that madam chair
representative? Go ahead.
>> Yes, madam chair. And thank you Representative,
it's even more compounded in the rural
areas where we have like,
I know you have Hidalgo
one assisted living. It's gone,
the nursing home is gone for
those of us who have a single source
provider.
And uh, I hadn't
even thought about the
senior mill sites.
They, during COVID,
we had the uh COVID
recovery funds that allowed
us to cover costs. That's
gone. So I hadn't even thought
about, you know, where we're at on
that. I'm kind of getting
back in the swing here.
>> Well, madam chair representative, I think
this is gonna cover more things that we haven't
even discussed here. But uh
it's, it's broad and I'm
glad uh that we're
you bringing up something some common
sense to, you know,
legislation that,
that helps uh balance
uh mandates with uh
funding from our
state. Uh So we
can actually uh provide
those things without stifling budgets.
Thank you, madam chair
>> representative. Next, we have a
representative of this.
>> Thank you madam
chair.
Thank you sponsors.
I am, I have
have deep conflict
around this bill.
Um Truly because I think
on the face of it, it
seems like the right
thing to do,
but I, I have such
concerns over, you know,
what, what we've got here
in the fir
around,
you know, questions around
constitutionality
um with regard to
the debt
provisions.
Um of course,
all the the Medicaid
concerns and Medicare
concerns and reimbursement rates that
I think we should be dealing
with a at, at a different
level in other bills which I I
know is happening.
So I just want to
understand
madam chair representatives.
Um you know,
where, where are
you with, with what the A
G is is you
know, questioning around the
constitutionality of
our ability to do
this
>> madam chair and
representative. It's the first time
the A G has made that in the
past, it has not been a conflict. These are
people who we we
are, they are providing a fee
for service and we are reimbursing
them. We set
the rate
and for
these providers,
they're not allowed to charge the difference.
So it it it truly
becomes an unfunded
mandate if it's
how is it unconstitutional
to pay them?
I can I childcare is my industry.
I have not been in the industry
since 2019,
but the state sets the
classroom ratio. They
set the class size
cap,
they determine the
qualifications of
the employee,
they set the training
requirements, they
set the pay scale through the
pay lattice,
they determine the square footage
and how many blocks are in the
classroom. You
cannot charge the
difference.
How is it
unconstitutional to
cover the cost of our mandates
for services to the most vulnerable
populations? I don't, I I've never
heard that
before.
>> Madam chair representative. Yeah,
I, but that's
what he says. So
I'm, you know,
I'm not so much
confused as you know, just
concerned
that
that this bill would then
would also, you know, violate
the procurement code.
And
I
>> madam chair and representative.
Um it is an opinion
and it's a, a really new
opinion that hasn't been, it's
been introduced since 19 and that's a new
opinion.
>> I have lots of other
questions, madam chair representatives,
but I'm gonna, I'm gonna let my,
my colleagues, >> madam
chair we were able to do on,
on that
point
just a quick question.
Um um madam chair
representative uh uh
representatives.
Where does it
specifically say in the
fir that it
or does it point out the actual
language that is makes it
unconstitutional? Other
than just a, a blanket
statement,
>> madam chair, it's on
page three.
It
GSD
mentions it. It's in the
middle of the page,
the
fir
article nine
section eight of the
constitution.
It's in the fir
so that's publicly
available on the
website.
This is the General
Services department that had
that, that
statement
in their analysis.
>> Have we answered the
question?
>> I think that we need to
move home.
>> It says that that
the whole har may be,
may be
a
>> madam chair. And I asked a question about
constitutionality with regard to
this. That's, that's where my
question >> and
the
>> madam madam chair and representative
and I could be wrong
but when, if we pass this,
we create a new statute and
statute, Trump's rules
or policies. So we
would be resolving a
conflict. I, I don't know, it's
new to me. I've, I've never heard
that argument
before.
>> Manager. I'm,
I'm gonna let it go. It's
ok.
>> Um, we're going
to go on to, uh,
Representative
Anaya.
>> Thank you madam chair.
Um, I
also feel a bit conflicted
about this, um,
from a moral standpoint,
you know, I see the language on
here would cover
the actual contractors
themselves, um,
meaning like the business, but there's
no,
there is no
language that would
also cover the employees.
And so I'm thinking about paid family medical leave
in particular, right? Like
we've been having this conversation
for a handful of years right
now. And from
my understanding, um,
the sponsors, which we're lucky to have
one on our committee. But
from my understanding, the sponsors
are actively trying to
negotiate something like this within
their own bill.
Um But
what I will say is I feel like
one this sidesteps that
process of it.
And that is one of the things
that I would like to
see, um, the
negotiations actually play
out. Um So that
is one of my biggest concerns.
I know that it's also a concern
when we're talking about paid family medical
leave that we would pay for the
employers' side
of the contract and not the
employees. And
as, as currently written,
I don't know if this was your intent,
but as currently written,
um, it seems as if
the
employers, if they
were contractors and,
um, they
would have their
benefit paid for, but the
employees would
not. And so
that's, um,
that's a concern of mine, uh
madam chair and
representative one is
sidestepping the negotiation
process with a very big bill
that's going through right now.
Um, two is
the way it is written
as now the
contractor, which could
be an individual, but also could
be an organization could
be a business
would have their portion
um of benefits
paid for.
Let's see.
Um
The second piece here is, of course, the
financial piece, it's a
little bit difficult
um to go
into this and say, ok, we
have an
un
we have an amount that is
unknown in
which we would have to
pay
um
benefits
or any sort of
future,
um
like any sort of future
legislation that we're passing.
So I'll, I'll
go to the doh example.
Um in the House
Committee analysis report
straight up, they say,
you know, they're currently managing
approximately $50 million
of contractual services
and that's just within the Department of
Health. And so I do
think part of this really has
to be an analysis of our
budget and
clearly this is not the Appropriations
committee. I know that's where you're going
next. Um
But I think that this would
have a huge impact on the budget and that
might be something that we would need to plan
for. Um, instead of
just enacting this
immediately on, I believe
that, uh, date is January
or July
1st of this upcoming
year.
Um, so that's the
second
piece.
Another piece is that,
you know, when we
are,
when we're thinking about being
fiscally responsible to
borrow from my neighbors over
here. Um
One of the things that I think of
that we, we
never quite delineate, but I would like
to bring attention to this body
is that when we are covering
either contractual services
or we are doling out money in our
budget. A lot of times
we,
we allocate money
to
corporations, out of state
corporations that are
multibillion dollar corporations.
And I have heartache with that.
Um I have heartache with
us
funding multibillion
dollar places.
Um That could be
our contractors.
Um I also know
and understand that there are
smaller entities
that are local or that are
operating on a minimal
margin. And so I would
like to see a differentiation
in the way that we're allocating
money. Um,
because I do believe that multibillion
dollar corporations are
very actively
taking advantage
of
the people in our
state.
Um Let's see
here, still >> doing on that
point, madam chair
because we were doing that
earlier
representative. I'm
sorry, I'm going to
let represent
>> Anaya >> and then continue
>> thank you my last piece
here madam chair and
representative
is the actuals,
this
is page two
lines three and
four.
Um
So I'm understanding that it
is
they are being held harmless for
wage increases,
but also cost increases
resulting from a change to
statutory benefits.
Of course, we use paid family
medical leave as an example. But
the other thing that I think of that is
um weighing heavy on my mind
and does often is
actually um
you know, potential proposals
to underwrite things like medical
malpractice insurance.
If something like that is
also in law,
we would need to cover the cost
of any sort of
um
of any sort of increases.
And so I just want to put that
out there because I actually
think this is a
huge
um financial
impact that we would need to
plan for. And
so madam chair
representative, I am happy
to keep
talking to you about this
legislation because I do
believe that we need a
mechanism in which
we can actually help our
smaller care providers.
Um
But I, I don't
believe I'll be voting for this
legislation.
I will say though, if
madam chair and representative,
if this is rolled, I would
happily try to work on
language with you.
Um
But I think as written
right now, I think there are just a
lot of
unanticipated costs
and um
also wanting to speak with our
other sponsors from paid family
medical leave to see how those
nega negotiations are going
to make sure that this would
not be in conflict
with what is going into
that bill as well. Thank you,
madam, chair representative.
>> Thank you. And um next
on the list, we have Vice
Chair Chavez.
Thank you madam chair.
Um I also wanted to express
some concerns about this bill.
If you look at the
um the House
Committee analysis, the
white page on the, on the
last, it's,
it's um the second
page g
comments from GS A.
Um they also speak
about not only
violating the procurement
code regulations
but also the
um
violations of the debt
provisions of the
constitution.
Um So I wanted to point that out.
The other piece is
in terms of
um the
summary. If you look
at the fir page
one of the
synopsis of the bill,
it sounds like what this bill
would do
is it would
create a liability
for the state for
anyone who has a contract
or a subcontract
um with the state
by uh
creating a liability
for the state. And then somewhere in here,
I also read that
there would be an unfair
um
advantage uh to
some uh
people who were
um competing
for um rfps
with the state. The other
thing that I wanted to point out too is I
think that we're mixing things
here. You know, there was
conversation earlier
about um
nursing homes and,
and not receiving the
correct um
Medicaid reimbursement. I think
that's very different from
contractors uh
who contract with the state.
Um in terms
of, you know,
responding to RF P's
request for proposals.
There is a bill we heard
it in health and human services
that, that proposes to
raise the Medicaid rate
for um
nursing homes. I don't remember
the name of the bill right now at this
moment, but we are
attempting to address that.
I totally support
um raising
um Medicaid rates
for those who are
providing services
to uh this is
stabled or any other
um service providers
in, in our community. Definitely,
that is something that I totally
support. But I think this
bill mixes the two
and I think that it
creates some real questions
for, oh, I know that it creates some
real questions for me in terms
of um really
constitutionality and,
and all of the issues that have been raised
in the A firfir by
the A G and other departments.
Thank you madam
chair.
Thank you. Are there any other
questions? Representative
>> Lodes
Vazquez
madam, chair members of the
committee.
Um
and sponsors. First of
all, I
want to commend you for
having a Democrat and a
Republican working together
on a bill. I think that's
wonderful in my
house. I have two sons, one
Democrat, one
Republican.
>> That's the whole part of the fiscal
impact report. And
in the past, there's always
been a fiscal impact report, I'm
guessing. But I
think probably the cost that
we're imposing on the minimum
wage usually,
um, the fiscal impact
report has been around 200 million.
So I don't understand
the
unfair.
Yeah, the
uneven playing field, every
contract tractor can apply
equitably
and the
unplayed, the
uneven playing field
is if we don't adjust
the minimum wage
because if no
one responds to the
RP or
if no one responds
to the contractors we put
out for bid, it would be
like paying for half the cost
of the bridge.
The public safety issue
is apparent
because if people drove on the road,
the bridge would collapse.
We contract with
road, you know, engineers and
architects and asphalt people and
people that draw the to, to
build the bridge. But we
fully fund the project.
That's not an unlevel playing
field. This is different
because if we're giving
someone $18
an hour to provide an hour
of home health care,
The 100%
of the, the cost
of what we impose on minimum wage
goes first to
the employee. The contractor
only keeps what's left. After
we mandate the minimum wage,
they pay the matching person
and they keep what is left.
If we don't do
the increase,
what we create is
uh deserts.
It's what happened with childcare
before we started the early childhood
fund and started fund supplementing
it. We had childcare deserts
in the state. So we inadvertently
create
deserts of, of
essential services whether it's,
I mean, I can, I can use the home health
provider as an example.
You haven't said anything, you should
say something
but it's, but, but it the, the
employer is the
contractor,
but they are getting paid for a fee
for service. And if
the fee for service falls
short of the
cost of the care,
then the employer who
is looking for a profit
unless they're, you know, like a family
member or it's a small business
that really cares about their community and
is passionate about what they do. They'll
stop that
service and
that's what I'm concerned about. I think
that's what my colleagues concerned
about madam, >> chair
members of the committee.
My dad was an
architect and
he would get, he would get
projects and, and he
took very good care of his
employees. I, you
know, I understand that concept
and I understand the Me Medicaid
piece and I think we'll probably need to look
at that soon um
as well.
Um
It's the uneven playing field
that I'm concerned about and where
it is that
um that
the WSD felt
the
impact
of the changes
uh
would,
would be
felt.
>> That is >> all
of the questions I have.
What is the sentiment of
the body
>> madam chair?
I there's a
motion can I
kind of add some
clarity on some
issues?
Um Madam Chair,
um
what dictates
the unconstitutionality
of a law
is a court
decision?
That's what determines
constitutionality.
We don't have a court decision
on this piece of
legislation,
you know. And so
that's important for the members
to know.
The other thing Madam Chair
is that we're
going into a frontier
area with
this piece of legislation.
So the legislation may
not be perfect in the way
that each of us
individually
based on our social
perspective, our
political perspective
understands the
legislation,
but I feel that
it has to go the
limits in terms
of really trying to iron out
those
profound questions that committee
members have.
And I don't think that we have
the answers to that
based on the majority of the
questions had to do with
money issues, with
appropriation issues with
procurement issues.
The role of this committee to is to
look at the labor
element, the
worker element
of the legislation
and appropriations could have
better answers
to those questions that
we were unable to kind of really
expound on.
So I would urge the committee to
kind of understand
that under
uh understand
that nature
of the legislation before
us and to give
it an honest chance of moving on
forward to the to the next
committee.
>> Thank you. And we do
have a motion to table
uh made by
Representative Anaya
and seconded by
vice chair.
The motion to table takes
precedence.
Will the
committee
>> Representative Anaya?
Yes to table.
Representative
Garcia
Representative Hall.
No,
Representative
Johnson.
Representative
Mejia.
No,
Representative
Ortez.
>> Yes. >> And >> can I explain
my vote on the motion
table?
>> Oh, ok.
Representative
reap
representative,
the
Representative Torres
Velasquez.
Yes.
Vice to Chavez.
Yes.
Chairwoman Royval Caballero.
Yes >> to
table
>> 64 vote to
table.
>> Well, we have a 6 to
4 vote to table
and Representative Ortez to
explain her
vote.
>> Uh Madam chair, I'm really sorry that I
had to vote this way. Um I
share uh the
sentiment of Representative
Anaya that I, I would also
like to work with
you to iron out some
of these issues and by
voting to table,
um I think that we can do that
and bring and bring this bill back.
Um After we've answered
some of these questions, I just
wanted to you to know that I really
appreciate what,
what we're trying to do here, but
I need to sort things out in my
head.
Thank you. >> Thank you madam chair and
thank you representative and please
as in the majority, as you
were talking about these conversations and
these big bills that we're not privy
to all I can do is
bring for solutions as
I see. And what from, from
what I know, please keep
this in mind as you guys
are negotiating.
>> So um before you
leave, I wanted to
express the very same
things, we need to have
continued discussion on this.
But there are a lot
of questions that will have
impact on some
things and then given the
nature of what's going on with
appropriations at this time as
you all well aware
and estima more
aware than all of us because
he is, he's been around
longer understands
um what we're
facing in, in going
forward. So it's better that we
just get our questions
answered and move forward. So I appreciate
your time. Thank you so
much
and I move on to
the agenda
item. Um
House Bill
282.
You made begin
whenever you're ready.
>> Thank you madam
chair.
I do want to say that I think this is the
most interesting bill that
we're gonna hear today.
Amy.
Um
We, I'm
here uh to present
house Bill 282.
And I just want to talk a little
bit about how this bill
came to
be. Um,
many of, you know, that I have
a young person
who was, um, placed
in my home at the age of 16.
He's now 21
um, when he graduated from high
school, um, I
don't remember the year now, but
anyway, started working in
the fast food industry. As many
of our high school students
do
came home early one
day. And I asked him, I
said, what happened? He said,
well, we all walked
out. I said,
what happened?
He said, we got tired of
the supervisor yelling at
us said good.
All of your, all of your coworkers
walked out together. He said,
yes. So
I took the opportunity
to educate
him about his rights
under the National Labor
Relations Act. And
those rights are that you
have workers have the right
to act in
concerted activity to
join in concerted activity
uh to protest working conditions,
to raise their voice about working
conditions. And that's exactly what they
did. He never heard
of the law. I also
explained further to him
that because there
was that law, they have the
right to go back to work
and they could not be fired for
exercising that, right?
So they did just that they
went back to work.
They explained
to the higher
up manager why they
walked out
and
the manager
actually took some action against
the supervisor.
She was just, she was suspended for
a day or two. I don't remember
now, but all of those workers
got their job back
in another conversation. I
had, I was telling my story
to a former
um agent of
the National Labor Relations
Board who worked in Albuquerque. And she said,
you know, I think
kids need to know what
their employee rights are
and the best place for them
to learn those is in
school, not
one on one, not in a
group, but in school, in a classroom
where we have experienced
teachers, experienced educators
who can teach them those
rights. So
this is how this bill was
born. What this
bill proposes to do is
do just that
teach
high school students what
their rights are in
terms of the workplace.
For example, what are
their rights under the
Equal Opportunity Act
under the Human Rights Act
under the National Labor Relations
Board. And along with
that also teach
them about their union
history. We
have a proud
union history in New Mexico
that we never hear about
Silver City comes to mind
where it Representative Terrazas
is from the
um the
strike in the 19
fifties
um is
nationally known as, as
a matter of fact, there is a
movie about that strike
and much more
important is not
only did they win their strike but
also the role of women in
that strike, the role
of women in labor. And that's
something that we hear even
less about.
Um So with that
madam chair
uh committee members, I
have with me,
um my cosponsor
sponsor um
Representative Guolla
and I also have with me,
a very expert
witness. Um and I
will ask her to introduce
herself a little bit. I
mean, I will ask her to introduce
herself and say a little bit more
about the importance of this
bill. And then she will also
be available to answer questions
about what the process looks like
in terms of actually
implementing this into
a school curriculum in New
Mexico.
>> Thank you, Representative
madam, chair members
of the committee. My name is
Ellen Bernstein. I'm
the president of the Albuquerque
Teachers Federation.
And in addition
to some of the amazing
historical facts that
Representative Chavis
pointed out. We
have a deep,
deep history, labor
history in New
Mexico. You
can talk about the fact
that Dolores Huerta
was born here. You
can talk about the
railroads and
the railroad industry
and how it grew
in this state
and how workers fought
for their rights
and went on strike
for their rights.
Um By the 19
twenties, the universal
Brotherhood of carpenters
and Joiners was
one of the largest
trade unions in
New Mexico.
Um It, it's
just, it goes
back uh
decades and
centuries.
Um
So
I think it's appropriate in
New Mexico that
we learn about our
New Mexican history, our
labor history.
And I think it's appropriate
that our
students learn about
our Public Employee
Bargaining Act that
was created
in 2020 just five
years ago. It is known
as the strongest
Public Employees
Bargaining Act in the
country. And I think
we should be proud of
that. I think this
is also timely
because there are some
people who are attempting
to erase unions,
not just from history
but from the future
of our country.
So information
about employees rights
in the workplace,
information about
the intersectionality
of human rights
with the public employee
bargaining on the Federal
National Labor
Relations Act.
Um All
belong in our New Mexico
Social Studies Standards.
What's interesting about our
standards is they were
created here
in New Mexico and they
are unique
in New Mexico.
So I was looking through the
social studies standards
for how we might amend
them going
forward, which would
be up to our public
education department.
And in the social studies
standards, there is
a theme entitled
Civil Rights and
People Power
Movements.
So it's a perfect
match to
go ahead and get
into the standards.
Put it out for public
comment again
and suggest
that this important part of
our history, these
important facts
about what it is to be a
worker anywhere
but particularly here
in New Mexico are
embedded in our social
studies standards.
In theme nine
civil rights and
people power
movements.
>> Madam Chair Representative
Guolla would like to
um add some
remarks,
>> madam
chair.
Thank you for um giving
us the opportunity to present this
bill. Some
states have already take the
initiative to include uh
these standards in their
curriculum and
this is therefore are
important of preparing
our students for the workforce.
So as teachers, we
want the students to be as prepared
as we can
get them ready. So
this uh this bill
is focusing to ensure that
they are informed about their rights
and responsibilities as
employees.
>> Thank you.
>> And with that, we stand for
questions
>> on, on the zoom. Do we
have anyone with their hands
raised
up
in
opposition?
Ok, thank you. So
those in the audience who wish
to speak in opposition,
right? Anyone in that
wish to speak
in favor of
OK,
the MKE is going to
you.
>> Thank you madam, chair members of the
committee, John Dirch with
the American Federation of Teachers, New
Mexico. Um unsurprisingly,
we are here in support
of adding these areas
to the curriculum in our
social studies standards.
We felt the the recent
revision didn't lean in enough
to the New Mexico connections to
the themes around workers
and labor rights. And
it's in incredibly timely
for this piece of legislation.
Um Unions are
are in the forefront,
labor movements are in the forefront
in the public discourse.
You see them uh
when you think about the Amazon
workers or you think about fedex
workers or UPS workers, you
see it on the news, but you also see
it in popular culture. If anybody
watches Avivi Elementary,
there was a three, see there's a three
episode arc on a
labor strike. And so
being able to educate
students to be able
to interpret and contextualize
what that means for them
and how that, you know,
humorous anecdote in
the sitcom may
impact them as a future worker.
So we do urge your support
on this legislation
um uh this evening,
thank
you,
>> madam, chair members of the committee
Carter Bundy with, ask me, I'm not
going to say it any better than our
sponsor and the experts did
as well as Mr
Dirch. We ask that
you support this so that kids get a
full well rounded
history of our economic history in
this country. Thank
you.
>> All right. So
now to the committee,
um we
have Representative
Ortez,
>> thank you madam chair. Um
I had a question about how
it was going to be taught, but then
the expert uh let us
know that it's the nine
civil rights and people power
movements
so that he answered my question. But
I did, I just wanted to
comment that, you know, as
a granddaughter
of,
um of a
proud member of
the
UFW, uh
as a daughter of a
proud member of Aps
Me for many, many years,
both union organizers, I
didn't know anything, they
didn't teach me anything about
the, the power of the
movement or
what it meant or what my
rights were. Um So,
I mean, I'm not knocking my grandma
and my mother, please. I, I
just don't want, I don't want to be, I would be very
clear right there,
but I didn't
learn about what the National
Labor Relations Board was until I
went to grad school at U and M
in my Masters of public administration
program. Like I just didn't know any
of that. So I think it's
just, it's
timely
um it's a history
that we can be proud of in
this state. And
I'm, I'm just, I'm really
excited about my
Children learning
about this from
someone other than me because I'm the
worst teacher
according to them.
That's it madam
chair.
>> Thank you. Are there any other uh
Representative Hall
then followed by Representative,
uh, Toves Velasquez
>> madam chair, madam, vice chair,
expert witnesses.
Um,
according to this, you would
begin teaching this in the ninth
grade. Is that gonna be taught every
year or just in the ninth grade?
I'm
sure
>> I wouldn't have the answer to
that. It would be up to the public
education department
to go through the
standards
and, uh,
decide
in what area
of social studies,
in what grade it would
be appropriate to
embed these
concepts.
And then,
uh for
myself, I would
imagine that they would
fit throughout
the grades nine through
12.
Um that none of
these areas are
necessarily focused on
for a great period of time,
but interwoven
throughout the themes that they're
teaching in social
studies.
>> Thank you madam chair.
So I have
a concern. I
mean, when we're
talking about education, I get the
civil rights portion teaching
history. I don't
have a problem with history but when we
begin to go into political
science or, yeah,
I hate to say it even
indoctrination.
Where do we draw the line?
Um Because
we already have our kids on a
full batch
of IND of, of being
taught different things,
their minds, at least, you
know, young men don't
fully mature
until a later age.
And so as we
teach this, I'm just
concerned
at what level,
I think ninth grade is awfully
young. I
do definitely
agree with a history
conversation any
time about it.
I'm just not sure
on the way I'm understanding
this
how it,
I guess I'm just not fully
understanding how it's gonna be done
because it says they're gonna
teach on it
and the Human
Rights Act, which is
important, the
Bargaining Act,
but then it gets into employees
rights in the workplace and,
and I heard the representative talk
about her son, which I
understand
what I, when we get into too
much of that. I think we can
confuse our young
people
and cause more of a conundrum
than we're actually solving. And
I just like your
thoughts on that
represented as well as
expert witness madam chair.
Thank you.
>> Uh Representative madam
chair. Let me
read to you the way the
standards are written
and that might help you
understand
um that it's the teacher's
responsibility
to take complex
concepts
and make them understandable
to their students and
put them uh in a
context that
is relevant to them.
So, for example,
in theme nine
civil rights and people
power movements,
one thing that the
standards currently
says is that
uh in
history,
historical change,
continuity of
context and
reconciliation,
they examine how
evolving global and
domestic understanding
of and respect
for universal
human rights
affected the development
of the civil rights
movement in the United
States. So
when you look at the development
of the civil rights movement
in the United States, which is already
a part of our standards
than what the social
studies teachers
know to do.
If these are, if these
concepts are also listed
in the standards is
embed them
as you look at the labor
rights that
evolved from the early
19 hundreds during
industrialization
and then throughout the historical
context and possibly into
the civil rights.
So that's what I
was trying to say about how it's
interwoven.
Another thing that they would
do
is they have a history,
standard, power dynamics,
leadership and
agency.
And in this one, the prompt
is analyze the
important policies and
events that took place
during the presidencies
of John F, Kennedy
Lyndon Johnson
and Richard Nixon.
Now not being a social
studies.
I don't know why they pick those
three presidents,
but I can tell
you, I
can tell you what that there
is a lot of what we
are speaking about
that evolved
during the
presidencies of the three
presidents that they list in the
standards. So
it's
um when you
work with the
standards that we have as
teachers, it
guides, but it
doesn't prescribe
and you have to
know enough about the standards
to teach to them
with every lesson that you
create.
>> Thank you. So madam chair
representative
experts. So
would this
being, I mean, they're
teaching it, but I would hope
this would inspire
conversation or
debate within
the young people, regardless
of how they fall
on this issue because they're gonna have
influence from home one
way or the other or they
may not have a, a clue
as to uh
representative Ortez point
that they didn't learn about this till
college. So I
would hope that would be part
of the discourse
in a class because
it, it's, I know it's a
difference between education
and labor, but we
just voted on a house bill
here a week or two ago.
I think it was Employee
Free Speech Act.
I just want to make sure
that a young
student
would have the ability
to
disagree
and not be
punished.
We're disagreeing. II, I
look at this room and here
we have not agreed on a few
things. I'm amazed
at how much we have agreed on
as a, as a freshman.
But I like
the discourse. I like, I
like, I think polite
political discourse is
important if we're gonna start teaching
this at, uh,
ninth grade because I think the
average age of 1/9 grade is what,
14 or 15?
Hopefully, I don't think things have
changed that much.
I just want to be assured that
these young people have
the opportunity
to either agree or
disagree with
what's being taught
without punitive action.
And can you comment on that,
please, madam chair?
>> Um, absolutely. Um
madam chair, representative
members of the committee.
Um
So the the
stereotype of a
high school history
teacher, um
if you read Funky
Winker bean, you might think
coach showing a film
or if you're my
age, you might think of somebody
who's standing
and lecturing
about
history.
Um But our
teacher evaluation
system is very clear
that we engage
kids, we
explain things,
we don't tell
them
how to
think, we don't
tell them what to think. We
tell them how to
be a thinker.
And so the social
studies teachers, I
know that teach in
high school talk
all the time about
how they engage their
students in
critical analysis
and debate.
Um much
like you do in the
legislature and
they would be
in trouble as
a teacher if
they criticize
a student for what
they thought or how they
thought. Um They're
just, they teach them to
think.
>> Thank you madam chair. That's my
biggest concern. And
teachers have a huge impact.
My daughter teaches first
graders, but the
impact on the impact
on Children and they're
still Children. We
by law maybe call them adults
at age 18,
but
the impact can be huge.
So whether the instructor
or the teacher, whatever
is
uh prola
anti labor, I would
just
absolutely wanna know
that this is
simply a
very linear
discussion
on our history of
labor and why it
exists. So, and
that's, that's into my comments,
madam chair. Thank
you.
>> Thank you. Uh We
have next
representative Torres
Velasquez,
>> madam, chair members of
the committee and
the bill sponsors. Um Thank
you for introducing
this bill.
Um
I, I
spoke earlier today
on the floor while
introducing my intern
um about
when I was in junior
high school, it
was the late 19
sixties and when
I entered my junior high
school in Albuquerque,
it was the first
time that school
had been desegregated.
It was the first time blacks,
Latinos and white students went
to the same, same
junior high.
And
so they hired
a young principal
and he had,
he brought in all these
ideas. He
hired teachers with long
hair, he hired
teachers that wore
miniskirts and
the parents. You could
hear them in the grocery stores.
How are those kids gonna
behave with those teachers?
They're not gonna listen to
them. Well, he
hired some teachers
and he, he worked with the
teachers that were there
and there were so many
incredible things they did in the
curriculum and one that really
stood out two
that stood out one was my civics
class where I got to
intern in the
house. Um
But another was my
history class, my social
studies class
and the teacher who was
older than any of us here at this
table
introduced
the history of
some of the things that were happening
in the country. But the history
of labor unions, the
history
of the
types of things that you're talking
about here.
And because
we did have the
opportunity to have
those conversations,
we all got
along, we got to
hear each other's perspectives
and I never
felt any level of
indoctrination or
anything like that. It
was more, we were
all being educated and
all being encouraged to
contribute, everyone
contributed for who they
were in all
kinds of things
and, and I can see
the benefit of,
of, of doing this.
I, I do have
one question that maybe
y'all can help me with um
related to the fir
so on the fir
they talk about the San Antonio
independent school district. I know
that lawsuit very well
and they talk
about how every state
determines on its own
if, um, public
education is a fundamental
right. And
hopefully, you know
that with the Martinez
case before we even went to
trial when it was
filed,
we fought for
and got very
easily, very
heartily from
the judge of the first
district court, public
education in New Mexico as
a fundamental, right? 10
for, in 11
years ago, 2014.
And, and so
I'm, I'm just
wondering,
um, if they call that other
substantive issues,
just wondering why they
might, the F I,
the people who created the
fir might insert
that in terms
of every state determines
its own,
um,
on its own if public
education is a fundamental right? But
I do think,
um, so that's just a question, I'm not
sure if you can help me with, but
I do think
that, um,
kids need to know
that kids
need to know that the education
they're receiving. That's a, a
fundamental
right and that
they have other
rights and that they
know what those rights are.
And, and so I, I
support your
bill, um, maybe
we can have a discussion later about
why that might be in here. Or maybe
I go to the people who wrote
this. I'm, I'm not sure
why they put that in
here, but I wanted to make sure that
you all knew in New Mexico
public education is a fundamental
right?
Thank you.
>> Um
Finished talk
about OK, representative.
So next we have on the
list, Representative
Johnson
madam chair and >> thank
you sponsors
of the bill. I, I
like this bill.
I'm thinking about our youth
who participate
in summer youth employment,
especially in rural New
Mexico. My chapters
provide opportunities
to employ
summer youth for the
summer so that
they can earn money and
uh perhaps, you
know, purchase,
you know, tennis shoes, clothes,
whatever at the beginning
of the school year and also
internships for
students who participate
in internships
and they may be a little older than
ninth grade. But
um I think
this is how we grow
our Children
into the world
of work
and uh how
to carry themselves,
what, what they should
know as a
foundation of how
to carry themselves. I think
this is a really good life
skill to grow
our Children into. So,
thank
you
>> representative. Next
we have Representative
Anaya.
I'm sorry, I read
wrong. Represented
RAAS. Your
next
>> thank you madam chair. Thank you
uh sponsors.
So you know,
um
a couple of things uh as
an employer
as all employers have
to, as far as
for information, we
have to post a
big
giant poster
and we have to put it where employees
gather we have
that we should have that we
should always have it updated. I
know that everywhere I go, I see
that. So it's,
it's something that all
employees, whether they're in
high school or
I don't know, elderly
can read and is there in
front of their face so they can uh
refer to it.
Second of all, um
madam chair representative
is there anywhere here that,
well, actually, I may before I,
I say this,
we do have a
curriculum that
is covering some of
these, um,
this history. I know
because uh,
um my daughter
did this in National History
Day. Uh They, they did
some of this NHD
does things like this
is that impact and change
the, the course of
history. Um
And some of the kids work
on similar things to
this is something
that if I remember
um correctly, it's even
touched on,
um
with both history and
government.
These are things that are
sometimes.
Um,
so I know
our, my Children are in high
school. I know they're
learning about this already
and, and, and,
but they
have it in different. I don't know how, how
this is gonna change that
um, when they're already doing
that. And
so
if they're already getting that
and, and we, we're proud of
our history and have
family members, many family
members are part of the union there
in, in in mining,
um, that changed
a few years back. I'm chair
representative. What reasons
I don't want to get into all that, but
they voted it out
or whatever the employees
themselves decided.
Um, and so
I, I wonder, you know, I, I sometimes
wonder why,
um, we're
seeing
union memberships
dropping in here
in recent times. It is dropping
and, and sometimes
go why, why are they
dropping? And
is, does this legislation
in any way, shape or form have to do
anything to do with that madam,
chair
representative,
>> I'm chair representative.
No, it does not.
Basically this
is a legislation
does exactly what it
says. Um
teach kids,
high school kids employee
rights and there are a number
of um
federal laws and state
laws that they
definitely need to learn about with
regard to the workplace. I think
somebody already mentioned that,
you know, getting them
ready for the
workplace, understanding what their rights
are and then adding in
the labor history because like I said
in my opening, you know, we
do have a very proud
history of
um labor and I mentioned
Silver City, there's also
a book that maybe
people don't know about. It's uh the
Labor History of New Mexico.
Um There's a book called The Gallup
14. Um
And so that's the
other piece of it. Um We do want
our kids to know um
you know, our labor history, our
union history because again,
um there have been some very
significant accomplishments
made by labor.
Um And
again, you know, it's, it's
part of who we
are and
it really creates a well
rounded student when you
teach um
as much as you can in
school uh
for students.
>> No,
sorry.
Thank you madam chair and
representative if the
schools are already teaching
part of this curriculum, so this will
be nothing that they had to add,
but doesn't mean that every school is
doing it. And
at the same time, um
we are also included in the
bill that Manager Humans
Rights. And it
is, it was interesting
that we didn't have it in our
curriculum mandated.
And hopefully some of schools are
doing it because we have the
flexibility in our, in our uh
standards.
But uh it doesn't indicate
that everyone is doing. So, I'm glad
that represent Deraa is
mentioning that is his
kids course is doing it.
So then it, it
doesn't change anything there. Thank
you.
>> I'm sure.
Um
Is there any balance here amount chair
representative where they get to hear
from business people also
or the the business
side of what's help
them change and what they offer
now? So that people
sometimes, you know,
because this is, is this only
about history or is it just
learning the rights uh is
it possible to have? And
I, I shouldn't say that. Let me,
I, I guess I need to rephrase
this. Is there a
balanced approach
to this, to this
legislation? I think,
I think it's in some ways
out of balance because,
uh, the way it can
be taught,
they need to see both sides,
not that they don't
want them to know that, but what
they should expect from
a business person on
their, you know, and give
it from that also, that
perspective
>> and share representative. Um,
I hope,
um, the
workforce,
the employers in this
case, um, are not against,
of students learning the
rights. I hope
that they are actually encouraging the,
the people that they work to
know all those paper that they have on
the walls and, and
understand them so they can
actually advocate for
themselves uh like
represented. Um
um Chavez just
mentioned that their,
their supervisors understood
that and reinforce it and
actually create a more productive
workplace. So
um our, our, our hope is
that um business
owners and every all
the uh business
people are also interested
in, in their workers to know their
rights. >> Like I'm
sure being able
to go and talk to, I'm
sorry,
>> representative members of the
committee madam chair.
Um When
I train
the union
representatives in
the schools in
Albuquerque,
we show them
their
collective bargaining
agreement. And
the way we explain it
is that this is
a book of rights and
responsibilities
for the employee
and the employer
and they are mutually
agreed to.
And the most
important thing that
we all need to understand
as employees
is one of the first
paragraphs
in the negotiated agreement
is called management
rights.
And it is the shortest
article in the
contract and
the most
powerful
because anything that's
not actually
delineated,
reverts to management
rights and that's
the employee.
And so to
understand that
this is how we work
together, this
is our working
relationship to
devi to find
some of these things
and make sure we all
understand them as
both rights and
responsibilities is
essential to
understanding the
labor movement and
contracts.
>> Madam chair representative.
That being said, what
you're saying, where do I
find that balance in
here?
What what line item do
I find that balance in
here?
>> So again,
what I would say is
when you're teaching the
concept
of the history
of collective bargaining,
the Public Employee Bargaining
Act that
delineates in
there. If
you look at it, it's not
just the rights of the employee,
but the employer,
the Federal
National
Labor Relations Act.
All of those things
are about people
coming together to
agree about
work rules. It's
never just about
labor creating work
rules on their own.
>> So madam chair representative,
I I, again, I don't have, I
think we should be very transparent.
I, I do it in my business. I have it
all the time. Everywhere
dealt, you know, we're
very firm about that.
Everything needs, gets reported.
We, we have a good
relationship. I think many employers
do the same thing. Um,
but that doesn't mean that they shouldn't
learn about it. I'm fine with them learning
about it. I just want to make
sure that we're getting a balanced approach
so that they can see that and
it's not skewed in one way or
another. I think that's in
one way or another. I mean, we've been
in this committee before madam chair
representative where we
said that it's, we can't,
I mean, we just heard a bill not too long
ago where we can't
have meetings over,
over uh uh you
know, talking about political things
that this is doing that
in, in, in to our Children in
some ways. I mean,
Representative Hall kind of
mentioned some of the political
things, but history is
very, very important.
Absolutely important.
Um Chair representative and it
should be taught and they should
know we in, in, in
gra counties, soil city know
Juan Chaac. We know
what that meant. We know the,
the, the um salt
of the earth. My family,
my mother was
born
in, in Santa Rita.
So I know the living
conditions. I understand
why they needed to do that.
I get all that and
I'm, you know, and I'm and I
support that kind of
history and
expression. I
just always believe
that we need to have
balance. That's all. That's
the only comment that I'll make.
Thank you madam chair.
>> Thank you. We have
Representative
Mejia.
>> Thank you madam
chair.
I just have one
question.
Is this an attempt to
increase involvement
in labor unions
among all young
workers by
using labor
rights
>> madam chair representative.
No, it is
an attempt to teach
um students
what their rights are
in the workplace
and also labor
history.
>> Thank you, Representative. Thank you
madam
chair.
>> Thank you. Um Next,
we have
Representative
Anaya.
>> Thank you madam chair
representative.
Um I have a couple
of comments
here. Um One, I
actually
um
I think the first thing I want to say is
we're here in New Mexico. We're passing
laws for New Mexico, but we're also not
passing them
in a vacuum.
Um And
I wanted to address one of the
comments a little bit earlier
because
teaching history is not
indoctrination,
like teaching history is
actively being rebranded
as indoctrination
because Oaks
quite honestly across the nation are
trying to erase what they don't
like. Um
But I do want to calm some of the
fears that were brought
up um
during this discussion.
Um madam
chair representative,
um I am
clearly it's been a little bit not too
long, but since I've been
in high school, but
madam chair representative, do you still
teach topics like
slavery?
Is it still being taught in schools?
Yes. >> All >> right.
Um The reason I want to call,
I >> just interrupt in
when you answer, just
answer into the mic
is
webcasting
>> in. Yes. It's part of the
history that we teach.
>> Thank you madam chair
and representative because
there were, there
were a few fears earlier
about teaching history
and students being able
to disagree. And from
what I understand, I think the
majority of students who are taught
about slavery
disagree. Um
And so I wanted to bring that up just
to calm some of the fears that are happening
right now. Um
But also to
Representative Mejia's
question as well.
Um Madam chair,
just because we teach slavery
doesn't mean that we are actively
recruiting slave owners
like that is not, there's
not a 1 to 1 correlation
with that. And so I do
hope as folks are voting on
this bill, that's something that they consider
history is actively being taught all
the time and it doesn't mean that anyone has to
agree with
anything. Um
But I want to address
um another
point that was brought up earlier,
madam chair and Representative,
I know our expert was
talking about
um the
Negotiated Agreement and
National Labor Relations
Board, all of these different
topics that you could touch within
the subject areas that would be
taught.
Um
And I just wanted to point
out it
perhaps this is what
um Madam chair and
Representative were trying
to say as well
is that labor
rights and
business growth are not
mutually exclusive
and in fact, many times
labor rights spur economic
growth. Um You
know, I'm gonna go back to our
conversation about paid family, medical
leave. We know that
when workers have these
rights, it is actually
an attraction to the businesses
that we have. And
so I don't believe that they're
mutually exclusive. I actually
believe that they can be taught one and the
same. Um
because when you
treat your workers, right, which many
of our colleagues here on this committee
have talked about, you're
able to keep employees
and have better employee
retention.
Um And the last piece, madam chair
and representative
is
um
the notion that we're already getting
this information in
schools. Um
Once again, referring
to the national
climate that's happening right
now, um
We are trying to
actively codify
as many things in our
state laws
as we possibly can
knowing that they are pretty actively
under attack.
Um But I also
want to add madam chair as
my last piece here
as
um as I
applied to be a union worker
at the Albuquerque Teachers
Federation.
I remember one of the first questions
that I was asked and it was what do
you know about labor history and labor
rights and legit?
The only thing I could say was the
Lores Huerta
and I knew she was
a union organizer. I knew
she was an organizer. I didn't know what
a union was. I didn't know
what a union organizer was,
but I knew that lady, I knew she was
great. And so I do
want to say madam chair
representative speaking to the concerns
earlier, we actually
don't teach this in a
robust way and I'm really
glad to see it um
added to our curriculum
in our state. Thank you, madam chair
representative.
>> Thank you.
And um we have
next Representative
Garcia
>> Gracias madam
chair.
Um,
you know, I think this really lends
itself well to,
um,
um,
the possibility of
maybe,
um,
kind of touching on
um apprenticeship
programs.
Um,
and, uh, you
know, while
members were kind
of asking questions,
uh, you
know, I was thinking of how we can
kind of maybe ground
the curriculum of
the, the teaching of employee
rights in the workplace
by actually having the
masters
do some of the
instruction.
And, uh, and
by that I, I don't mean
certified qualified
teachers already in
the profession,
but maybe,
um, uh, for
example, manager,
uh,
yeah,
an individual from the sheetal
workers
kind of a,
uh,
doing a presentation
on their apprenticeship
program
and how
they can, ah,
kind of, uh, achieve
certain goals
uh in terms of,
um,
kind
of employment stability
and also financial
stability,
you know, by
going through their apprenticeship
program, practicing under
adjournment at a place
of employment.
And actually we don't manage here
that some of these sheet metal
workers
are uh that come out
of the apprenticeship program
from the sheet metal workers
union end up
at Intel,
you know, where these guys are,
these guys and gals are getting
well over 4550
bucks an hour,
you know, and I think our kids
need to know that,
that there's these
apprenticeship programs
that can lead to
stable
kind of employment
and stable financial
security if
they go the route.
And that means going into
an apprenticeship program,
uh having a
mentor, be
that mentor of a labor
union, uh
supervisor of an
apprenticeship program.
And kind of
them becoming the
history,
you know, of being
at the workplace,
being at the workplace as a union
member
and they did it
the right way and the hard way madam
chair, which is going
through this apprenticeship program
and learning the skills in the
trade. And we know
madam chair that there's
definitely
shortages
in the trades.
So I can see this kind of going
beyond what's already been
presented by the presenter and
the and the experts
but but
also involving the
masters in the instruction
itself.
And I think
this might lend itself well to
that madam chair. Thank
you.
>> Thank you. And um
before I recognize
um for the
second time, briefly,
uh representative Terrazas, I
did want to interject
and um
use my time now before
we take action. So
I, I wanted to thank you
um for bringing this
forward. I
don't want to continue being an
instructor at U and M and
being stared out of the face
or questioned
about uh
in a not in a
negative way but in a positive
way that had
they the students in
my ethnic studies class,
Chicano, Chicano studies
known
about their
history
and about what I was talking
about. And this was even
when I was teaching a graduate
seminar, graduate
seminar, being
told, had we
known this
and had a better understanding
of our history and the
relationship.
We would have taken a different
path in our
studies and in our
career,
it also uh is
very important for
critical thinking
skills, as was
mentioned. Um
when we get the students
at the university
level, one of the
hardest things for us as
instructors
is dealing
with the
answers to the questions
that we pose and
their inability
to have the critical
thinking because
they lacked in that engagement
early on prior
to getting to the
university. So
this is incredibly important
on multiple levels.
But also I wanna
just say one more thing.
Um I'm extremely
proud of my grandsons,
eight and 10 year olds,
but they're in the Los Angeles
Independent Unified
School District, which
is very different than
here. And the reason
I'm saying I'm proud of
them is because
just the other day, the
eight year old
was able to raise his
hand in class
and say, my
nana marched
with Dolores Huerta.
My nana marched with
Cesar Chavez.
Why? Because
he was receiving
that important
instruction
at the grade level that he was
third grade.
And in fact, they had already been
introduced to
um this instruction
in seven second grade.
And finally, I will
say
that the
League of United Latin American
Citizens and
the NN A
AC P were both founded
in 1929.
There is very little
reference to
the significance that these
two national
civil rights
organizations
continue to have in our
day to day life. But
in the battle for civil
rights to see just
this piece of legislation
come before us and it should
have come before us a long
time before.
So I I think
it's just incredibly
important. The balance
is
um representative,
the RAAS and others. The
balance is that we
haven't had a balance. We've
only had one
side of the story
and it has been our
attempt with the
introduction and the fight for
ethnic studies
and with
legislation pieces like
these and our other
efforts to recognize
our unions and the battles
uh that have been fought,
that have been providing the
balance in the classroom.
So I just really wanted to
say that because
it's so incredibly
important to this discussion.
And now I'll go
ahead. Um Thank you,
Representative Deras for
giving me the
time.
>> Thank you madam chair. Thank you for
sharing that. And I think the
last, you know, uh Representative
Garcia and
uh uh mentioned, you know that this
could go, it looks like it could go
farther. And this is exactly
what I was trying to
mentioned earlier
is
it's I can see this
going further and, and,
and in in balance
to what the Representative said
and what the madam chair
said um
is in my
area as
miners
who work for
uh uh Freeport
and
on average, make
is the biggest employer
and pays on average more
than any other employer
in Grant County.
It's important to have that
balance, have
also a, a worker there
and that, that can also
do the same to
express what,
what uh
they are doing, what
in, in benefits that they get
their pay.
And one of
the unique things that we're doing madam
chair um Representative
in, in, in Grant County
is we are
focusing and working
with
this uh with Freeport
where there is no union
yet, a
lot of community
involvement where we're putting a
vocational, they're, they're
donating
land
equipment,
etcetera
to work together with
the high schools and the
university to create
an apprenticeship program
in a school, a vocational school
so that we do have a
pipeline and
giving them those options to
work and learn a
good trade and
fill in and, and go beyond
that to see those C
ID type,
um
those C ad type of
um um jobs,
electrical
plumbing, uh
carpentry,
etcetera that they
can get and, and Freeport's
willing to do that and
give this these young men
and women an opportunity to,
to expand
their, their, not only their
knowledge but their, their skill
sets, but they can
actually do something
else or, or
make more than sometimes even
a, a four year
degree uh person that
earns a four year degree. So
I think the, the point that I'm
making is balance is
important for me. I'm
gonna, I'm going to support
this with the
understanding
with caution that we
are balancing this
educational piece
so that both sides,
both sides of the spectrum can
express how they
are, how, how they enjoy
their job or, and, and
on both spectrums,
but there's balance in the classroom.
Thank you madam chair.
>> And um now what is the
wish of the committee
