Here's what's causing that.
Well here.
Your
mind.
Madam chair representative I
believe that if we're bill for
what has been.
We are Mr Burciaga can you hold
it for a second sure how we
figure out a way to.
Okay.
Wait one second sure.
Yes.
hundred thirty services I
noticed that the thirty of the
sixty day that's all.

What
technology.
The board or.
Across.
Our the.
Thank you.
Mr Burciaga in will have you on
now to respond Representative
Crowder.
Your is about the employer
liability insurance premium
are your over here is this
consistently brought up an
additional ten thousand dollars
a week.
There is what's called that
increased.
Madam chair can you hear me is
this about the unemployment or
or the liability.
My understanding and we I have
B. M..
Chief financial officer on
unnecessary Espinoza my
understanding is that those are
amounts that we could build
directly by our GSD and going to
the budget is that correct SO.
Madam chair representative yes
that's correct liability
premiums are assessed by DST's
mismanagement Division so like
on chances increases happen to
us year after year depending on
circumstances and especially if
we've had claims in the
buildings that could be another
tractor the cost.
Madam chair representative I can
To that
some of this is is retrospective
so I think sometimes we get
billed by GSD after the fact so
this may be include expenses
that we've incurred but are are
for session ploys so we have to
put it in the attic in that
session budget so we can pay for
that.
Go up.
I'm not saying that in the
insurance world I'm wondering
why isn't happening in this
bill.
Madam chair and representative
we don't the state does not
purchase insurance through any
commercial it is self insured
and it's based on losses workers
comp liability
anything that we self insure for
we have to pay directly so it
may not have gone up other
agencies may have gone up on
some it is it is bill to each
our budget entity so in this
case of this amount was sent to
us by GSD and said this is how
much you owe for
house of representatives it may
have been different for the
Senate may have been different
for council services etcetera
but we get those amounts and we
put them in the respective
budget so that's where we get
that we are self insured so we
just get billed by GSD risk
management and put that in the
budget to pay for.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Mr Burciaga.
Workers on and.
My first question is is this for
employees or does this this
includes like Legislative
Council.
Work with your staff this is
just four sessions that that
correct.
I just find it interesting that
one out.
If it was more in the thirty day
session that had been for the
sixty day session before and
even though we're down six point
six and the more this year than
it was.
Both of.
About that.
It.
No that's okay I just I was just
curious.
I would like to answer that.
Madam chair this is an asset
I think the question was on the
workers comp premium lights
going up if they have less
people in the building I
understood correctly
but the premiums are actually
bill to us at the beginning the
fiscal year so we can build our
budget so it's not based off the
current situation that we're in
right now so are ease next year
may look different.
So madam chair is there is there
any method of repayment for
overpayment or anything like
that if if.
In in extended six
circumstances.
Madam chair representative no I
don't I don't believe so again
this is assess from GST and they
bill us based on on the
information they have and.
And we're back pay fees.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you.
Representative.
The.
response.
Right.
Can you Representative can use
the Mike please.
Well
as.
So.
So.
Please.
We have any more questions from
our representatives.

approve the budget.

Second everybody in favor of
approving the budget say I.
Okay.

through the budget we've

legislative session graduated
