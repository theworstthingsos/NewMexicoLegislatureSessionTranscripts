Let's take roll.
Representative on order.

Represented Mia.

floor later.
as a more.
Here
of my chair.
You
Be here.
We have a we have a quorum.
Ready, we're uh contacting I
have a question.
If, if you, if I may.
So, so on, uh,
The 164, you said it was rolled.
Is it indefinitely also or just
Yes.
So, so, and I don't wanna, I
don't wanna confuse you, Madam
Chair. You said 144 rolled
indefinitely, but I was
wondering I'm 164.
That one as well.
We will be notified by the site
to do with their bills going
Chairman McQueen.
I didn't see you. We were trying
to call you.
You're nice and quiet
you need to make a grand in. OK,
let's go ahead and begin with
the Herman Queen.
Good morning, everyone. Uh, I
think.
This is my lucky day from the
scheduling point of view, uh,
happy to be here.
Um
Meer members of the committee, I
was for you not too long ago,
uh, with the constitutional
amendment changing our sessions
from 60, 30 to 45, 45.
Um
And I think part of the debate
part of the discussion in the
timing of our sessions is how we
do our work.
ly
And this is a, it's a house
concurrent resolution, uh, which
means it has to pass both the
House and the Senate.
Uh, and that's how you do a rule
change, uh, in the legislature,
uh, and what the concurrent
resolution basically says is
that
Going forward, each of us would
get.
5 bills to be the lead sponsor
on.
So your name at the top.
On 5 bills.
In this to me is um
You know, part of the discussion
about
Um
How we get get our work done.
Uh, I personally struggle with
trying to do too many things.
And not doing any of them as
well as I should.
Um, and this is a way to focus
legislators on their top
priorities.
Um
So, for example, uh,
If you have the 5 bill limit,
you know.
Maybe you don't do a license
plate bill.
Yeah, personal petive of mine,
um, you, you probably know your
bills better.
Because you've had more time to
dig into them.
I mean, I have, you know, I have
some bills that I know inside
and out, and then I have some
bills that, you know, I got a
call a week into the session.
Can you sponsor this?
And
I don't know them as well.
Um, it would allow us to spend
more time on bills.
It would allow uh more thorough
vetting discussion,
consideration of our bills.
Um
So as the, as HCR one says,
It'd be 5 as the lead sponsor.
You could still co sponsor
bills, right? And through cos my
herbs.
Be a named sponsor, you could
still be involved in, in lots of
bills. Uh, and then there's the
below the line co-sponsoring,
which um
Doesn't have it, doesn't seem to
have a big impact uh in our
legislature.
But you could still work with
other people.
Uh, including, uh, in other
parties in other chambers.
I did.
We the
Uh, so in
10 years of statistics can just
Through those. OK, ma'am chair?
OK, thank you very much. Um,
So there's, you can see some in
the statistics, you can see some
back and forth between the 60
and 30 day sessions. Obviously,
the 30 day sessions with the
germaneness requirement are
greatly reduced. And if you have
5 bills per um per member, we
have 112 members, that's 560
bills. So you can see where this
would uh cut down on the number
of bills in 2014, which was a
30-day session, 776 bills.
2015, 1449 bills.
2016, 667.
And you could see, like, even on
the, the 6030 and the 4545, that
would tend to even out, I think.
17, 1,234, 2018 635.
2019, 1483.
2020
Again, a 30 day session 713.
2021, um.
Which was a 60 day session, but
during the pandemic, and there
were some bill limits during the
pandemic. I'm not sure how.
Carefully they were enforced,
but 853.
2022, again, a 30 day session,
477, so that would be below the
560, 2023, 1,187.
And last year, 641. Um, so this
to me is just sort of starting
the discussion, um, this bill is
co-sponsored with Senator Pat
Woods, um, and grew out of a
conversation that he and I had
during the interim.
And with that, I'd be happy to
answer any questions.
Thank you, Chairman. Now we will
go to the audience.
Do we have?
Anyone in the audience who'd
like to speak in support of the
bill.
Any opposition?
Let's go to Zoom.
comments and committee member.
Thank you, man. Um.
Um
Madam Chair, uh, representative.
And your statistics, is there an
average of, and I might have
missed you saying this, average
of how many bills per.
Um
Legislator.
Ma'am cherubs and Lujan, I, I
didn't do the math, uh,
eyeballing it, I would guess the
average, you know, 60 session is
about 120 or 1300 and the
average in a 30-day session
looks like.
7 or 800.
And just said, um.
I myself, Madam Chair, during
it, it depends on on um.
The workload I have and what I
worked during this, the interim,
but I, I understand you. I think
we had this conversation. I
understand and I think it's,
it's wise for us to be kind of
limited, but what the limit for
us would be 5 bills in this.
Is that correct?
Um, would you be willing to move
that to 7, Madam Chair.
Um, ma'am, uh, representative
Lujan, I am.
A couple of points on that.
First, I, I had a conversation
with one of our colleagues and I
won't name him, but he said, you
know, really the number should
be 3. And I I tend to agree with
that, but I also don't think I'm
gonna uh get the legislature to
go along with that, you know, I,
I know I have, um, certainly
more than 5 bills. I typically
have more than 5 bills.
You know, I would also say that
like my
The bill I spent the most work
on.
I'm not the lead sponsor. We
started in the Senate, so, uh,
you know, I'm working with the
Senate side, uh, and so there
are different ways uh to
approach this. I think, uh, you
know, if you did.
Um,
Uh
If you lifted the number to 7.
It still might have beneficial
impacts, but you would, you
would end up pretty close to
what some of those averages are.
So I, so I'm not sure, so it
might even out the bills between
different members because I know
some members carry fewer, some
carry a lot more.
But the overall amount of bills
would be considering, um, at
least in the 30 day sessions and
who knows if we have 45 day
sessions or not, uh, would be
pretty close to what we're
already doing. Thank you, man. I
just lastly, do you think that
by doing a measure like this, it
would encourage more work groups
to work on issues.
I'm sure, um, ma'am, chair, uh,
represent Lujan, absolutely, um,
because, you know, if you're,
first of all, you can, you can
be a sponsor of a bill without
being the lead sponsor, so you
can work on something and still,
you know, take part in that. Uh,
it, it encourages people not to
be duplicative.
You know, if someone else is
working on the same subject, you
know, you're both gonna be uh
you know, sort of using up one
of your 5 if you uh introduce
competing bills, so that's a
good reason to collaborate. And
again, because of the way,
because it would only limit you
to 5 bills as a lead sponsor. I
just think there's a lot of
opportunity there to work with
other uh legislators. Thank you,
ma'am. I tend to, I, I do
support your idea. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Madam
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh, good
morning, Chairman. Um, I'm
really glad you brought forward
this bill.
To begin the conversation.
Um, I too went back and looked
at some of the session
statistics that I had in my
inbox last night when I saw this
bill was coming up. Um, and so
it was interesting in in.
2019.
Members of the House sponsored
on average.
9.4 bills. And we're talking
about bills only. Is that
correct, Chairman?
Uh, ma'am, um,
representatives.
So thank you for that. And so
members of the House sponsored.
9.4 bills, members of the Senate
on average sponsored 15 bills on
average.
Um, and in 2021, which, as you
all will recall, was the
session, um, where much of uh
our operations were
Uh, virtual
Um, and people were encouraged
to really limit the number of
bills, although that was not
adopted as an official rule,
Madam Chair and Chairman, um,
Members of the House sponsored
5.5 bills, members of the Senate
sponsored 11 bills.
On average, so, um.
So one, there's there's sort of
an inner chamber difference and
and one might also consider that
members of the House represent
about 30,000.
Voters and members of the Senate
represent about 50,000 voters,
so there is a different sort of
the size of.
Representation or the, the
proportion of representation
there. Um, so that, that's one
thing.
Um, although as a member of the
House, I'm not sure that I would
advocate for members of the
Senate to have higher limit, but
um, when you look at the actual
representation, it, that might
make sense, um.
But Mr. Chair, I
I have a couple of concerns
about doing this right now.
So one is the limitation on the
Bills which could be considered
in a 30 day session, Madam
Chair.
And Chairman, which is already
extremely restrictive.
Um, and so then when you think
about this in a 2 year in a
biennium.
Um
We're really
Or we would each member would
really only be able to propose
their ideas, 5 of their ideas
once every 2 years.
Unless you were able to
Uh, Madam Chair and chairman get
the governor's support.
Or whether it was in a strictly
an appropriation matter.
And I
I, I that, Madam Chair,
Chairman, that, that worries me
because I think.
We each probably work on and are
concerned with more than 5 ideas
every 2 years and so
In, in thinking about this, I, I
feel like your other.
Legislation that we looked at
previously.
Which would lift the
restrictions on the 30 day
session.
Almost needs to come first.
So that we can have this
opportunity.
Every 2 years. Um,
And, and Madam Chairman, what,
how, what, how do you view this
in light of emergencies or we
often have late breaking issues
that are identified.
That
That's one of the reasons why we
have generic bills, so I assume
If this if this was in place,
would we?
Then not have generic bills.
And
How would we address those kind
of late breaker issues.
Um,
Mante represent Skansky, uh
thank you for those comments.
Um,
I, I tend to agree that this
Proposal is better suited for
245 day sessions than the
current 60-30.
But as you observed, I, I think
we need to start talking about
it and thinking about it.
Um
As for late breaking.
Um
Bills, you know, of course, we,
uh,
We
We have a bill introduction
deadline.
Uh, which is actually set in
statute.
Uh, which I didn't know until
recently, and I'll be back
before you sometime soon to talk
about that.
Um,
And, you know, we, we sort of
get around that by doing um
Generric bills, dummy bills.
Um, you know, certainly,
Uh, you know, late breaking
bills, you know, maybe uh, you
know, leadership has a dummy
bill in their pocket.
Uh, committee chair or something
like that, that's mostly what we
do now. Uh, it's not explicitly
addressed in this proposal. Um,
I think it's certainly
It could be worked into proposal
either uh implicitly or
explicitly. And I think it's,
you know, already implicitly, it
could be done, you know, people.
You know, introducing 5 bills is
not a minimum.
maximum, so people might still
have capacity or maybe um we
strategically have one of those
5 bills being a generic bill
that could be swapped out at a
later date.
Madam Chairman,
that's really interesting and I,
I wonder if you'd consider
putting in, you know,
Except for.
Bills related to the public
health, peace, safety, welfare,
the, there's language in the
Constitution.
Allowing for that and I wonder
if, if an exception for that
would allow for those generic
bills.
Um
In this rule.
To match that. So, Madam Chair,
that would be
One suggestion, um.
And
And I think just my final
question, Madam Chair and
Chairman, that you, there's a
lead, so you're establishing in
this rule.
In the joint rules of the House
and Senate.
leads the concept of a lead
sponsor.
And so, and that's basically how
you're limiting, um,
Madam Chair and Chairman, I
just.
I would love for you to reflect
on, because currently there are
many bills as, as you yourself
observed where the workload is
shared between
The lead house sponsor in the
lead Senate sponsor. I'm
sponsoring a bill like that too
where.
Uh, both of us have been working
side by side, and currently we
have this sort of
Informal and rule where you can
have one and that, that we have
these sort of top two lead
sponsors, if that is desired by
the sponsors. So would you just
reflect on how this would change
that.
Um,
Ma'am Cheubs in his fancy in
some ways, I don't think it does
because
You know, those, those names
aren't listed side by side.
Someone gets listed first.
I mean, if you look on the, look
on the website, you look on the
bill on this bill. I'm listed
before Senator Woods.
Um, as I mentioned earlier, my
top priority legislation for
this session.
I'm not the lead sponsor.
Um, so, you know,
I felt that it was more
important.
Um, to start that legislation in
the Senate than it was for my
name to be on top.
Um, so I, I think because this
allows for up to 5 sponsors
named sponsors, including the
lead sponsor, you can still be
among that, you know, that group
who's whose sort of name is on
the bill, who's maybe name is on
the board when you're debating
the bill on the floor. Um, but
someone's gotta come first and
that's just how we would count
it. You can be the lead, the
first listed sponsor on 5
billion.
Thank you, Madam Chair, uh, and
Chairman.
You know, I, um,
I feel really passionately about
strengthening our branch.
And I, I think there's an
argument to be made that this.
Strengthens the branch by
Focusing each member's
attention.
On a smaller set of issues.
On the other hand, I'm afraid.
That it weakens our branch
because it doesn't allow us some
flexibility to respond to what's
going on or respond in the
middle of session to a late
breaking issue, um, and in
combination with the limitation
on subjects in 30 days sessions,
um,
It just feels
Um
I'm not sure I'm not sure on
balance where I feel, but I
think I've shared with you all
of my concerns. Thank, thank
you.
Thank you Madam Floor leader
Representative Block.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair,
and Representative Mr. Chairman.
So some of my questions were
answered already, which is good,
but I did have a
clarification for you.
First, to start off here, page
3.
Going to page 4 on the bottom
here with the new language. So,
To be clear
Madam Chair Representative, so
does me being a primary
co-sponsor.
On a piece of legislation count
as one of the 5.
That I would be allotted, Madam
Chairs representative.
Uh, ma'am Cha represent block,
um,
You, you, uh,
Allude to a difficult uh
Terminology problem that we have
in the uh in the legislature
that is if, if
Someone comes to me with a bill
and says this is a good bill. Do
you want to sign on?
And I say, yes, and I signed on
in this sense I'm a co-sponsor.
But if I'm
Above that line if I'm on the
top 5, I'm actually a sponsor.
Although it's also in a sense
co-sponsoring, you know, the
terminology just the way we use
it just doesn't really fit well.
Um,
So if you think about the, the
yellow sheets and our bills, uh,
below the line there is, there
are 70 lines.
You can, you can have every
single member of the house
signed on as an actual
co-sponsor, um, and we have done
that in the past on some bills.
Um, there is a bill uh for a um.
Uh, naming a
Uh, public
Place for a deceased member and
we got everyone to sign on, um.
To that bill honoring uh the
late Steven Easley.
Um, so that's there is still
that co-sponsorship, but, you
know, under our current rules,
you can have up to 5 named
sponsors, and this continues
that practice. It's just that
one of those 5 would be
designated the lead sponsor.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative there. That
clears it up a little for me,
but I guess.
It would make me more hesitant
to co-sponsor a bill like if it
was something that was super
important to me.
In my district and I wanted to
be a top of the line sponsor for
some reason.
I would, I guess it would make
us really hesitate, at least
before we sign on to a bill
cause I guess we could
technically etch our name off
the top before it gets filed and
then sign below the line, but I
just, I think it might.
Discourage some collaboration
when it comes to that. If
The person is not really getting
that top of the line
sponsorship, and I'm wondering
if you've heard anything about
that, Madam Chair,
representative. So, ma'am Chair,
uh, Representative Block under
this proposal, you could still
be a sponsor of really an
unlimited number of bills.
You know, if
The co-sponsor in my
understanding is the below the
line that, you know, 1 through
70.
You know, it's, you could be
more than 5 named sponsors.
In an unlimited number of bills.
You know, and there are, there
are times where, you know, you
want one of your colleagues.
You know, their name on the bill
because they know about the
subject or they bring, you know,
a certain experience or
credibility to the topic.
And that's actually not limited
in this proposal. It's just you
can only be the lead sponsor,
the top name listed.
On 5 pills.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair and
thank you, Representative. OK,
so, so I could still be a top 5
sponsor.
With
Any number of bills as long as
I'm not the first name on the
bill.
And so, Madam Chair
Representative, what, so what,
what is
How does that work with the
Senate? Because I know on the
Senate side, usually if you want
to build a pass in the Senate
side, you should have a Senate
sponsor on your legislation. How
would that work? If I was a
Senate sponsor, and if I was a
senator, with the senators lead
sponsorship in that chamber
count as one of their 5 bills,
manager.
So Ma'am Cha represent block,
um, of course, we don't have to
have 0 sponsors for houses, we
can send them over without um
Since sponsors and I, you know,
I try to get some sponsors, you
know, because it's helpful. Uh,
it's helpful to have someone
carry it in the other chamber.
Um,
Uh, this is a concurrent
resolution, meaning it would be
adopted by both chambers and
both chambers would be subject
to the same rule.
Um, so they would have the same,
uh, they, and they, we would
have to adjust our process a
little, they would have to
adjust their process a little.
Um, they currently, I think,
have their, you know, their, you
know, we, we do sponsorship, one
of 5, and they have their and we
don't really do the and thing,
um, and they have bills that
have, you know, a dozen ands on
them.
And they would need to adapt
their process to having no more
than 5.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, Mr. Chair. So, next
question.
I, I was wondering about these
certain specific bills that we,
we run every year. So,
HB 2
HB1
Capital outlay bills.
There's
Uh
Tax bill
And then also just generic
bills. How, how does this work
with those? Because if I was the
person leading the charge on the
tax bill, for example, I would
kind of find it to be less
representation for me, I was
only allotted 4 bills, so
Chairman Lente, if he was
sponsoring the tax bill, for
example, he would now only have
4 bills, not including the tax
bill because that would
As as it's written in this
legislation that would count as
one of his bills if he's lead
sponsor. So have we considered a
carve out for those, Madam Chair
and Mr. Chair.
Um, ma'am Chair in B block.
I, I have not. It's an
interesting question. Um, I, I
do think
Um, you know, it's, it's sort of
an honor and a privilege to be a
committee chair, and if you have
legislation that you sponsor on
a routine basis. I think that's
sort of part of the
Um, the job duties of being a
committee chair, and I also, I,
I saw represent a small, I don't
know if he German small. I mean,
So, so he sponsors Heel too.
I mean, I'm not sure there's a
heavier lift than House Bill 2.
So, um, like the, the idea that
I, I know he's he's sponsoring a
bunch of other stuff including a
bill I'm working on. So, you
know, um, you know, I haven't
Do to carve out force specific
bills that we sponsor, uh, every
year. Another example would be,
of course, has won, the feed
bill, which is not as heavy a
lift, but still an important
bill.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair and
thank you, Mr. Chair. I think
that would just be maybe
something I'd suggest to have
the carveouts for those big
things that we must pass,
especially like a
reauthorization bill of capital
outlay dollars, that's another
bill that we have to do and, and
so I know that we need to make
sure that these things happen
and we need an HB 2, we need an
HB1 that's just bare bones
minimum, so I would just maybe
consider that going forward. And
then I guess I would just
I know that people have a lot of
very important projects in their
communities, and it's hard to to
limit them to 5 and, and I
looked at certain members of the
of our committee, including
myself, I have 21 bills that are
primary top sponsor and some
others have 1612, 23, 20, and
then I looked some in some
other.
Committees, there's one
individual who has 31 bills who
was their primary sponsor, and
then one who's 21 bills, so I
think especially with these
larger bills regarding at least
things like health care.
And things that are super
detailed that need their own
legislation.
Could we also be maybe
incentivizing. I know we don't,
we technically are not allowed
to log roll bills, but
It's happened before. We've seen
some election bills that used to
be 2 pages and then they turn
into 181 page bills. So how
would this guard against
something like that, Madame
Chair and representative.
To Manches block, I, I, I do
think if we adopted this
proposal, the bills would tend
to get longer.
Uh, and to me, a good example of
this is a former Representative
Rehm.
Um, every year, Representative
Reh had
20 criminal law bills, you know,
strengthening.
Uh, penalties, tweaking the law,
doing this or that. And, and
there's really nothing to, that
would, would have stopped him
from rolling those all in the
one or two bills.
You know, so we would tend to
get, I think longer bills
because rather than doing a
short discrete bills if they
were related topics that they
did not violate the log rolling
prohibition, they would likely
get lumped together.
Um
You know, I, I, I think that
would be one consequence. Uh, I,
I still think it would be a net
benefit.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair and
thank you, Representative, and,
and I'll continue listening to
the discussion. I think it's,
it's an interesting idea. I
mean, I'm not opposed to it. I
just think we may need some
carve outs for those big pieces
of legislation and then, you
know, I'm all I'm all about
government efficiency like I'm
team Doge all the way, right?
But I think it's important that
we need to have some kind of
guardrails for those kinds of
things that we need to do every
year and maybe that could be
something considered. So that's
all I had. Thank you so much,
Madam Chair and Mr. Chair.
Brigo.
Thank you, Madam Chair. um,
thank you, Representative
McQueen, um, I'm.
Very glad that we have um.
leader here today and also our
Republican whip because um two
things. I
I
See that, you know, I was
reading all of the different
states that have done this, and
I somewhat agree with you in
terms of efficiency.
Um
But I also question the whole
issue of democracy and, you
know, I have lots of
My constituents sometimes that
come to me at the last minute
and uh, you know, I've already
introduced a lot of my bills and
they're like, can you do this
bill for us and, and I'll give
you an example. One was just
recently I met with the film
folks.
And um
You know,
So
I agree with um with our uh
floor leaders.
You know, it seems like there
should be some sort of an
exception.
In here, um, written in that.
That um
I mean, if the bill goes
forward, it talks about, you
know, an exception and maybe
that's made by the leadership or
something. I don't know. I mean,
it depending on the issue in the
community and all of our
communities are so, so varied
and so different, um.
The other thing, uh, madam, uh,
Chair, and, uh, Representative
McQueen is, it seems to me like.
There's so many different moving
pieces to um
You know
Kind of the
The way that
The Legislature functions, both
the House and the Senate and,
and we have different roles.
But
I think that
And, and with your last bill, I
also said this, is that we
should be looking at all of
these things as a, it's like a
bicycle, you know, you don't
look at just the pedal. You
don't look at just the, the
steering, you don't look at just
the chain. I mean, it works
together and.
I, I have, I take a little bit
of issue that we're not looking
at the entire system as one
piece.
And I wish that our floor leader
was here to hear this, but I
said it once before, and I say
it again. I just have issue that
we just look at one piece at a
time. I think we should be
looking at at these issues
comprehensively.
To see how we make our um
Just how the legislative
functions more efficiently and
more effectively and, and those
are my comments, ma'am. Thank
you.
And I'm sure I moved the table.
Have a tabling motion.
We have a tabling motion.
Representative Nonu.
I'd like to vote yes to table.
Do we get to explain our vote if
we're tabling.
the
Representative Black. Yes, sir.
Represented Borego.
Representative Lujan.
A resentative Mejia.
Yes.
Representative Zamora.
No.
Uh, Madam, Madam Vice Chair.
Yes.
Madam Chair.
No.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you Representative, uh, Chairman
McQueen for bringing the bill. I
certainly understand why you
brought it. I don't want to
repeat everything that my
colleagues said, um.
I will point out, I really liked
the analogy that I'm
representative Borego brought up
about.
The legislature working like a
bicycle and you cannot look at
just one piece, it all works
together. I'd just like to point
out that in looking at
Your legislation, if I may,
representative for a moment that
your legislation does work like
a bicycle because you are
looking at every age that, um, I
do think.
That with this particular bill.
I appreciate the focus that
you're trying to bring to the
legislature, make sure, making
sure that.
The cream kind of rises to the
top that we're really focusing
on, um, the major priorities
that we have.
My concern
Again, to restate a little bit
from what my colleagues have
said is that given the current
nature of the way the session
works that limiting bills is
extremely limiting in the fact
that we can only bring up our
Top 5 ideas every other year. So
once
Other parts of the bicycle are
um de-rested and modernized and
refitted, I would be more than
happy to have this conversation
again. So just thank you again
for this bill, Madam Chair
Representative.
Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Thank
you. Um, thank you,
Representative McQueen. I
appreciate this effort, uh, um,
a lot. My concern was, um,
actually I have the benefit of
just representing one county,
uh, a, a large municipality, uh,
and, um.
Others who may ask for uh for
assistance. My concern was for
those representatives who
represent multi-counties, I
think of Representative
Armstrong, um, representative
Linte come to my mind just
immediately. And I was wondering
how that might impact their
decisions to prioritize 5 with
multi-counties, so that, that's
the only reason why, but I, I
Really appreciate the thought
put into this. Thank you so
much.
But we also may go over um.
The modernization.
Madam Chair, I have a question
right quick. Um, I'd like to
I wasn't real clear on the vote,
and it was, it was 5 nose to
table and 4 yes to table, right?
No.
And there's 5 bills.
I thought it was the other way
around.
Are we sure on that?
Would you like to do? No, we're,
I'm good if everybody else I'm
the one that's off. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
We could, we could do a revote.
Thank
Thank you.
Ma'am chair, um, if I may, uh,
I, I was unclear on the vote
too, cause I thought it was 44
and the last foot was sinceancy
who voted no.
So
So I was, I was just unclear.
Mhm
Yes, so um
we'll go through it again. OK.
So I had onion or as a yes.
Locke as a yes.
Borego has a yes.
Luhan as a no.
Thea a, yes.
Uh, Sainsky is a, uh,
No
No
Zamora as a no.
Little as a yes, and Johnson as
a no.
Everybody's vote correct? tell
it correctly.
So it was 54 table. OK, so it
wasn't, it was 53 when hispancy
was out of the room, which I
didn't understand, and I just
wanted to say thank you for the
time. Uh, I appreciate the
discussion.
And I would encourage you all to
think about this and and talk to
your colleagues and, and see how
this idea might develop.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Now, we will go to.
House Bill 164. It was not
rolled after all, so.
Minority whip Martinez and.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee, I'm sorry for
the confusion earlier.
Um
Running between committees this
morning. I'm gonna get my steps
in before we go down to the
floor.
Um.
Today I bring to you House Bill
164.
Um, which restores a 2% cost of
living adjustment for public uh
public retireeses over the age
of 65.
For people who are retired
before the end of this fiscal
year.
Until 2020, the New Mexico State
statute stipulated that public
employees who contributed into
the PERA fund earned pensions
according to a specific formula.
And that those pensions would be
accompanied by a cost of living
adjustment.
That would basically keep their
pensions close to inflation.
Um, in public employees
contributed a specific amount
from every paycheck into the
PERA fund system.
For future pensions and the 2%
cost of living.
In 2020, in response to concerns
about the solvency of the PERA
fund, the legislature eliminated
the 2% cost of living
adjustments.
Rose retiree colas at 0 for 3
years, followed by a risk, risk
sharing model based on fund
solvency and investment returns.
The effect of the 2020 change on
retirees is that in the past 5
years, while inflation has risen
a total of 22%. Retirees have
only had 1% cost of living
adjustments, meaning they've
lost almost 20% of their buying
power.
The hope that the elimination of
the colas would somehow help the
fund become solvent, have not
materialized as a fund
insolvency continues to
increase.
Well PERA fund solvency is a
problem that must be solved.
We have learned that it cannot
be solved on the backs of
retirees.
Cost of living adjustments are
not salary increases, they're
simply adjustments made to try
to ensure that the people are
able to pay the same amount in
expenditures as they did the
year before.
This is especially important as
we age because at some point we
can no longer work.
At least not that jobs was
significant pay and our expenses
continue to rise through the
health care.
Through health care and in many
cases assistance with daily
living, either in our homes or
moving into an assisted living
facility.
Many retirees made a life choice
based on knowing that the
retirement income would be
Uh, I venture to guess that
every retiree felt that when
they retired, they had just
enough, enough to get by, not to
get rich.
They were counting on those
colas that were stipulated in
law just to help them get by.
The bill includes an
appropriation of $10 million
from the state general fund
recurring to support retirees
from state government.
Appropriation is adequate to
maintain the compounding colas
for 5 years.
The bill includes a mechanism
for retirees from local
governments to receive the 2%
colas. When the respective local
government contributes to the
fund.
To cover the costs for their
retirees.
And I'm sure we do have an
amendment, if you'd like for me
to cover the amendment right
away.
Yes, let's pass out the
amendment.
While they're passing the
amendment out real quick. This
amendment adds a sunset clause.
Um, a 5 years this ensures that
the recurring funding
In the bill of $10 million
sufficient to cover the PERA
estimate of the cost.
For the 1st 5 years.
Um, and we do have a
Couple of of uh tables to pass
out also.
You've been
OK.
And like I said, Madam Chair,
this bill is not going to make
retirees rich.
It's just gonna help them get
by.
Um, we started at 65 because
that's about the age that people
Um
are no longer working full-time
jobs.
They're um
Buying power dropped
significantly.
And we just want to be able to
make sure that they have enough
money to get by.
And with that, madam chair, um,
I'd like to introduce my experts
this morning.
And green roaming.
And we have several people who
would be interested in
commenting, um,
You, did you have a comment?
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, and
especially thank you to the
chair to the sponsor for
bringing this for.
Shouldn't we move the amendment?
I'd like to move the amendment.
Go ahead and um, are you making
an opening statement? Not on the
amendment. OK. Let's go ahead
and um.
You can finish your thought,
ma'am, and then we'll, um, move
to adopt the amendment.
Go, go ahead 2 amendments.
Did you want me to make my
statement now? Yes.
OK.
Um
The situation for public
retirees is in crisis. In the
past 5 years alone, we have lost
20% of our purchasing power. The
changes made in 2020 affected
44,000 public employee retirees
across the state. 32,000 of them
are now receiving a 0.5% cola.
This is despite the fact that
every day that they worked,
every paycheck they earned and
contributed a portion into PERA
and the day that they retired,
the law committed to them a cola
that would keep up with the cost
of living.
Retirees are not asking for a
handout. Retirees are asking to
be paid what the law said they
earned.
We have distributed two graphs
that compare, uh, the impact of
a 2% cola and a 0.5% cola. And
if, if I could just discuss that
briefly with you, the, the first
chart with 4 lines on it, 4 bars
on it, starts in 1999, so if
they're retirees still alive
today that were retired in 1999.
This would track.
Uh, the situation there, the
blue line on that graph reflects
the actual cost of living
changes. You can see that it
fluctuates. It changes slightly
every year, uh, and a drop in
2008 when the Worldwide
recession hit and then
fluctuating recovery, the years
2025 forward, of course, are an
estimate, and they're estimated
at the average of the last 25
years. That's 2.57.
The feds like to hope we will
only increase by 2%, but if you
average it out over the past 25
years, it's 2.57.
The green line on that chart
shows what a 2% cost of living.
Adjustment would have would be
for that time period.
The red line at the bottom shows
a pension with a 0.5%, which is
what is in the law now, and if
it had been for the past 25
years where things would stand.
The orange line that you see is
the actual PERA retirement laws
that started at 23%, and you can
see early on it did track with
cost of living, but when the
cost of living dropped, uh, the
3% was seen to be too high, and
it was changed to 2%, um, and
then what happened in 2020, it
when it sort of flat lines,
that's the changes that resulted
in, um, that, that were the
result of Senate Bill 72. The
second chart that you see is
Only 3 lines, and that starts in
2019, when, when uh Senate Bill
72 passed in 2020, and what you
see there is the actual cost of
living again with an estimate of
uh the 2.57 in the, in future
years, but the actual cost of
living in contrast with the 2%
and in contrast it again with
the bottom line of the 0.5%
cola. So it's an extreme
difference that you can see
resulting um from
The 0.5%. I was Speaker Egoff's
budget analyst in 2020 when
Senate 72 passed and I sat in
HAFC every afternoon. Um, I saw
long lines of retirees who spoke
in opposition to the proposal,
so it was not a solution that
everyone agreed to. There was a
working group that did look into
it and they did make the
recommended changes, and I think
in defense of them, they didn't
realize what was the, the
outcome gonna be of that bill.
Because we were told and the and
the law actually says that the
colas are going to fluctuate
from 0.5% to 3%, and nobody
seemed to realize that that
lower end was never going to
change in our lifetimes. It'll
never reach 1% even in our
lifetimes and beyond, and I
think people just didn't
understand that at the time, but
we do see that now. Um,
Every year that despite the the
Lack of colas for retirees now,
the unfunded liability continues
to grow, and so it's not a
result of retiree colas and
taking them away has not moved
the needle. Um,
Anyway, I will, I will tend to
stop now. I just say that for
someone like me, I, I lived
through my mom's death at 95.
She got dementia at 90. I know
the care, the cost of care from
90 from for people when they
have dementia. My sisters and I
were all working. None of us
could take off and be full-time
caregivers. I know what it costs
and retirees.
Planned to have a cost of living
that would stay relatively close
to cost of living changes, they,
they planned a pension that
would do that when we retired.
So this 7010 we're asking for
that to be restored. And that's
where I'll stop. Thank you.
Chair of Point of order.
We have uh, we were given two,
Yes, can we clarify which we
we've moved.
Moving.
I'll go ahead and move to
discuss the amendment.
Madam Chair, we are, uh, on
amendment.
230612.1.
And in the spirit of
transparency, Madam Chair, I am
a
Uh, public retiree.
Um, but I, this will not affect
me for a few years since we
started at.
65 years old.
it.
So the amendment number is
0.230612.1.
Please go ahead and go through
the amendment.
Madam Chair, the, uh, this
amendment sunsets this bill at 5
years.
Um, and with the $10 million
funding.
Um, it, it will track, so won't
have uh negative effect on the
fund.
And I believe the committee has
Been distributed this.
information.
discussion on the amendment.
I'll discuss them and amended
bill will now go to.
We only have one amendment.
We're not discussing the other
amendment, right?
No, madam Chair
So we only have the 0.230612.1.
So discard the other one.
Madam Chair.
I already did the whole bill and
then I would go back and we drop
Madam, did we, did we have a
vote on the amendment to just
the unanimous.
Adoption. I just want to make
sure.
23062121 We are not looking at
the other one.
The 11
Do we have any objection to the
objection that I have is, is not
to adopting this amendment, but
that we were given two
amendments, and then we go
through the whole bill.
And then we, we, we study it
with these amendments.
And now we're going back.
And it just, it just confuses
the whole process. It's
representative Zamora, I did not
know.
I was handed to 2 amendments. I
assumed there were 2 amendments.
I did not know until the
representative presenting the
bill told me that there is only
one amendment. I'm sorry, I
can't do anything about that
just for clarification, I'm
sponsoring one amendment.
That's it.
Uh, the other amendment, um,
So, so I'm not sure where it
came from, but the, the one that
we're discussing now is, is my
amendment.
Um
So
I'm not sure that clears up the
confusion, but I just wanted to
make sure that I did not submit
both amendments.
Uh, there was just we submitted
just one.
Mad, Madam Chair.
And, and I understand that,
Madam Chair, but we can't get,
we can't have clarity in our
heads on these bills if, if this
happens, I would like to see
this bill rolled.
And, and then I gather our heads
back together and, and
understand exactly what we're
doing.
You, do you have a bill with the
amendments on it?
Madam Chair, uh, this amendment
is fairly simple. It just, it
adds the 5 year sunset.
Doesn't change.
A lot of the language, it
doesn't change the substance of
the bill, it simply adds the 5
year sunset.
Thank you. So if we could now go
to public comment.
And those in support of the
bill, please raise your hand.
Uh, back to the audience, those
in opposition to the bill,
please raise your hands.
S.
Go ahead. One minute, please.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair,
members, uh, Greg Trujillo,
executive director with PERA,
uh, please realize we're not
anti-Cola, uh, but the funding
that this bill proposes is not
adequate to fund a 2%
compounding cola for members.
Uh lifetimes, and I'll be
available for any questions.
comments in support of the bill?
OK.
stand.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, I just wanted to say
when I started working for the
legislature, the cola was
initially tied to inflation,
cost of living, and it got too
confusing.
Um
But then when I was still
working at the at the
legislature.
In 1992, they changed it to 3%.
And when I retired in 2010, it
was still 3% for 3 years, and
then it was changed to 2, and
that because the inflation and
the cost of living had, we, we
were basically the, the cola was
too rich, a little bit too, too
rich. So we went back to 2,
which felt fair.
Um
The, the profit sharing or risk
sharing model, I can't remember
what it's called. Uh, basically
added like 100% the fund had to
be 100% relevant.
It had been an 80% factor, 100%
is what usually, usually is used
with businesses.
I mean, if, if a business
closes, they need to be able to
pay all all their employees. One
does not generally think about
government doing that, and quite
frankly, if the state of New
Mexico were to have that
problem, we'd have a bigger
problem than just our, our cola.
And so I, I just, I, I
questioned that.
long term, this, the, the fund
needs to be looked at. Thank you
very much.
Madam Chairman, um,
Members of this committee, uh,
my name is Roxanna Knight. Uh,
I'm a former
Government employee, I retired
out of the council service in
2012. I did send um emails to
all of you in support of this
legislation.
Um, I wanted to
Agree with everything that the
proponents and the presenters
have said.
Um
Being an analyst for many, many
years for state government.
I understand what happened 4
years ago and why there was some
kind of an agreement.
At the time, I was completely
unaware as a retiree as to what
was going on.
And I think there needs to be
more involvement when these kind
of major decisions are made.
Also understand that over time,
things change.
And we've learned after 4 years
that some components of this
agreement are really harmful to
retirees, and especially someone
like myself.
And um
I didn't expect my husband.
Right, oh, there's time. Thank
you.
Thank you.
11 minute comment, please, Madam
Chair, members of the committee,
I heartily support House Bill
164. I worked for nearly 30
years as the deputy state
librarian for the state of New
Mexico and as a woman, my salary
was not um the same as male
counterparts with the same pay
classification. Now, as a single
woman on a fixed income, um,
this pension is paramount to me,
and I'm very concerned about the
solvency of PERA as
As well as the rising
inflationary costs, so I urge
you to please vote in favor of
House Bill 164.
Thank you. Any further comments
in the audience in support of
the bill.
Or in opposition before we go to
Zoom.
Seeing none, let's go to Zoom.
Do we have any comments?
In support of the bill. OK,
committee members.
Represented a block.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair,
and
Mr. Whip, good to see you all
here today and
And I, before I ask questions. I
do want to say I am supportive
of the idea of your legislation.
I think that
At least in my district, we have
a lot of folks who
Need this. And so my comments
are probably going to mostly be
talking about the folks who are
on the municipal level, people
from the county who paid into
Pira and have retired, so.
So, Madam Chair and
Representatives, representative
expert. I'm wondering how does
this affect those folks who
retired from, let's just say
Otero County, or the city of
Alamogordo or the the town of
Of a
To Rosa or folks like that,
Madam Chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative Block, um, this
wouldn't affect them at all.
This, this was brought to me by
uh
Retirees from the the state
workforce, um.
And
That, that's basically what the
bill is, is uh trying to solve
here.
And if I could clarify as well,
um, the bill contains funding
for the state retirees at age 65
from state funds, and it gives
the, it gives the authority for
local governments to contribute
the funding for local retirees
at age 65 and um they would need
to each be informed of what
their, uh, amount they would
need to contribute is by
Department of Finance or by PERA
who could inform.
The Department of Finance, so
they each know, um, the reason
for that is that uh
historically, state funds have
funded.
State state employers on state
employees retirement and local
governments fund local
government retirees, and we
consulted with some of the best
financial experts, uh, in New
Mexico, including David Abbey,
including James Jimenez, who's
been here earlier, and I hope he
returns here to this, um, and
their recommendation was based
on, uh, keeping those funds
separate. That's the reason for
that, but ideally all retirees
from all
s should deserve that 2% cola.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair,
and thank you for the
clarification. So,
So, just to be very clear, there
are 2 different funds.
And so if this fund goes
insolvent.
From state payers would my
county and municipality
individuals.
Be deprived of their benefits if
that does go insolvent, if it is
to funds, Madam Chair,
representative.
Madam Chair, if we could have uh
Greg Tre here from PERA comment
on this.
Madam.
Thank you. Uh, there is one
fund, there is the Para fund
that covers state, county, and
municipal workers. Uh, it's a
multi-employer cost sharing
plan. So we account for the
division separately, but it is
one fund.
Does that answer your question?
Thank you so much, uh Mr. Madam
Chair and Representative and
experts that, OK, so that does
give me some, some heartburn.
I have to say, um, because I
know that folks that there's a
lot more state employees than my
local county employees in Almo
Gordo and Otero County. So I do
want to make sure that their
funds are protected and if
they're going in the same place
and maybe the colas are
different, um, that does give me
some concern. And so, Madam
Chair Representative, I also am
looking at just this, the
inflation that has happened over
the last few years, I think.
2022 was 8%.
Uh, the year after that was 4%
after that last year was 2.
Point or 3.2%, so I, I know that
this is an increase and it's
good that it's, it's going
forward, but I'm just wondering,
Will this even be enough for
those folks, and then if it's
not, I see that there is also
$10 million.
appropriation with the current
legislation and according to the
FIR I believe it was, we need 71
million just to to fund this
next year in 2026. So can you
just address those concerns and
I just, I'm just wondering about
that. I just want to make sure
that the corpus of the fund
stays there so we can have
interest, but also that we have
funding for the future, Madam
Chair.
Madam Chair Representative
Block, I have some Rolaids in
the office if you want to stop
by after the meeting. Um, but
this, this.
Is focused on
4 state employees, but there is
the option for the, the local
municipalities to participate.
Uh, like Mr. Trujillo said
there's 3 different
funding streams
Goes into one fund, but they do
track.
Um, each of the uh
participating.
Um
Branches
Uh, so if Otero County would
like their employees or their
retirees to receive this.
They're more than happy to join
the family.
Of this bill focus focuses the
attention on the state
employees.
Um, and we use state general
fund to
to provide the money. Um, we, we
have talked to several um
economists.
They agreed that the $10 million
going into this fund for the
next 5 years, uh, would be
sufficient to cover the 2%.
Now, whether PERA will
Ever become solvent, um,
That remains to be seen.
There's a lot of factors that go
into that and how
How the rate of return.
Um, fluctuates, but this bill
focus focuses uh
It's main attention on state
employees and the
$1 million should cover that
according to the people that
we've.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair, and
uh thank you for that. And I, I
guess I won't belabor the point,
but
I do have questions about this.
I want state employees to get
increased colas. I really do. I
mean, my, my father is a state
employee, right? I have a vested
interest in supporting this, but
I do want to make sure that
folks
Have a fund in the future, and I
think we would need to inject a
large amount of money in the
corpus of the fund now. And if
that was what the legislature
was so inclined to do, and that,
that would be something that I
think could alleviate some of
those concerns. And then I know
Madam Chair and Representative
Pira, this fund is very, it's
very truncated. It's very
separate from us. So I think I,
I've spoken to some folks over
at Pera cause I've wanted to
solve this issue myself. I was
actually close to opening a bill
to do just this to increase the
colas. And they told me
that. Pretty much we can't tell
Per what to do.
We can give them money, but we
can't necessarily tell him what
to do because from state law or
constitution, it says that they
are two different entities. So I
I guess I would love them to
have a bigger returns on
investments. I don't know if
there may be talk of of having
para work with the SIC, the
state investment Investment
Council because I know that
they've been doing a great job
with their funds and maybe the
board of Perra could could do
something like that, but I mean,
I'm not against the idea. I
think it's a good idea. I just
have some of those concerns and
I will continue to listen to the
discussion today, and I thank
you so much for bringing this
forward. I think this discussion
is very important because if we
made a promise, we need to keep
it. So thank you, Madam Chair.
Committee members.
Representative Barrego.
Armchair, um, and thank you,
Representative. I, I will say
that I signed on to this bill,
um, and I also will say that I'm
a retiree.
Um, so,
Putting that on the table. I'm
also the former chairman of the
PAA during the recession. Lucky
me, right?
That was uh a a very, very
difficult time in 2009, 2010
when the parafund lost $7
billion overnight.
And um we're still trying to
recover. I mean, we have not
recovered.
And um
Madam Chair, Representative, um,
I think that, you know,
The reason I signed on to this
bill, although I'm a municipal
retiree, um, is because I think
that we need to start discussing
this issue.
In its entirety.
Um, I think retirees, you know,
and, and representative block,
Madam Chair, brought up the
issue of inflation and not just
inflation, but um, you know,
consumer price index. I mean,
there's all so many different
pieces to this, to this, um,
You know, both, uh, I mean, the,
the para fund is only 67%
funded.
Those are our government
employees.
And I think that the discussion
that Representative Martinez
brings up here is really
important because we need to
start discussing.
How we take care of our state
employees, our county employees
and our municipal employees and
after the fact that they retire
because they're even Social
Security is not being raised. My
mom just got her check the other
day and she's like, oh my God,
look at this. And she showed it
to me.
And she said, I got like
$10 or something, something
really, really insignificant,
and I think that, you know, and
I bring the fact up that I was
the chairman of the, the, the
fund in 2010, not to say that I
was president, but show what's
happened since then in 2013, we
had another um recession, and
then after that, you know, and
we had um COVID and we have,
we've had all of these
significant factors.
That have affected our fund.
In a negative way.
And the problem is, is that when
people start when less and less
government employees are paying
into the fund.
Then retirees.
We are in a situation where they
may not at some point receive
their pension funds.
And so, I mean,
Really looking at the whole
system and sort of the economics
of it.
Um
We really need to start looking
at how to, even if it's small
infusions, Madam Chair and
representatives, um.
At a time to start raising the
bottom of the fund to a point
where, you know, with the
compounded interest within time,
it will
At least start
Maybe, you know, start raising
that um unfunded liability. And
so I, I commend you, uh,
Representative Martinez, and
Madam Chair, for bringing this
forward, and I did sign on to it
even though I, I am a municipal
retiree, but I think that this
begs the discussion.
And I, and I applaud you for
that.
Representative Lujan.
A movie do pass Mounter.
That where we uh take the role
for that vote, Representative
Zamora.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh.
Thank you, Representative for
bringing this bill forward.
I think everybody's concern is
the same.
About the
About the solvency of the fund,
and do you, do you feel like
this one time infusion and then,
and then what happens?
Uh, Madam Chair and
Representative on down the road.
If it doesn't get funded in this
manner, again, it's
Where where's the money gonna
come from?
Madam Chair Representative
Zamora, that's a good question.
Um,
The $10 million infusion is, uh,
recurring for 5 years.
Madam Chair and and represented,
I don't mean to cut you short,
but the amendment said 20
million now, right? Or am I on
the wrong amendment? Wrong
amendment. So, so, and, and that
was my protest in the beginning
of this committee, is that all
this gets confused?
We had a 10 million amendment,
we had a 20 million amendment.
We amended, I amended the bill,
I put it in my head and
Now we're going back to 10
million amendment.
Uh, I, I'm sorry for that, but
it's just my frustrations.
Uh, showing us the uh the way
all this got done and, and, and,
and the bill was rolled.
When we started committee and
then it it was pulled back on
the table and
That go, go ahead.
Representative, I'm, I'm sorry
for my frustration.
My apologies.
It's easy to get frustrated in
this building. Um,
I'm not sure if there was a
question.
Uh, the, the question, uh, Madam
Chair and Representative is
We're funding this
Out of the general out of the
general fund this time?
And, and, and it's but it's
calling for a fund.
The money is to be applied.
But not
Recurring
So, so then how
What's going to happen?
When this money runs out or or
from what I understand in the
numbers that I gathered and and
studied was that even the
infusion of $10 million doesn't
cover.
The 2%, am I correct in saying
that, Representative? Madam
Chair Representative and more if
you have this.
Yes, sir. OK. This shows that
the $10 million per year
totaling $50 million coming out
of the general fund.
Will be sufficient to cover the
2%.
Will it make PERA solvent?
Absolutely not. That's a whole
other discussion.
Uh, the two funds, um,
That are involved in this is a
transfer from the general fund
to the PERA fund.
Uh
$50 million over 5 years is not
gonna make that solvent.
Those are much bigger issues.
Uh, but the $10 million per
year.
Uh, according to the information
that we have gathered should be
sufficient to cover the 2%.
And, and, uh.
I believe the numbers that I
studied were uh representative
of Madam Chairs were 70 million,
but you're, you're telling us
here in committee that 50
million will cover it, uh, Madam
Chair Representative, Madam
Chair Representatives of more.
You may have
Gathered different information.
I'm not, I'm not sure where it
came from, but
This sunset of 5 years.
Um, and the numbers that we've
gathered.
That should be sufficient for
the 5 year.
Uh,
Time frame
Madam Chair and Representative,
so that goes back to my first
question, what happens after 5
years?
Madam Chair Representative,
Madam Chair Representative
Zamora, well, with a five-year
sunset.
Uh, unless it's extended, it
goes away.
Uh, Madam Chair, Mr.
Uh
Member of the committee
representative Zamara, yes,
excuse me, um.
The question of solvency of the
of the bill and the question of
solvency of of fund are two
different things. The solvency
of the bill, the FIR says 30
million for the state and 30
million approximately. That's
where you got the 70 million.
That assumes no sunset.
And that's a dividing the cost
of those colas over a 25 year
period, uh, equally in equal
payments with the sunset, the
1st 5 years are fully funded.
And so now that you've adopted
the sunset, the $10 million a
year will fund that. The
solvency of the fund is a
different question, and it's not
insolvent based on retiree
Collis. It's, if, if this bill
were to pass with no
appropriation. If it passed, if
you wanted to give 2%
every public retiree, local and
state, it would have an $840
million impact to the
ERA fund, which sounds like a
lot.
That's for 25 years of 2% colas.
The PERA fund grows in the
unfunded liability has been
growing. If you look at the
actuary report on PERA's website
for 2023. It shows a growth in
that one year alone of 0.9
billion.
Not related to employee retiree
Collis.
It's related to other things and
200 million of that was
expected, um, and projected
based on prob I'm guessing it
doesn't say why, but I'm
guessing they projected an
increase in the retirees due to
baby boomers or aging in.
But 700 million of it was not
expected, so the PERA fund needs
a real thorough examination as
to why is it in, why is it
becoming in so you know, why is
the unfunded liability growing,
and they need to look at
policies and make changes. But
the coal is for retirees are not
the reason 25 years of colas
would be less than one year of
other.
causes to fund, you know, to the
fund unfunded liability.
Madam Chair, that's all the
questions I have.
Thank you. We'll go back to a
motion by Representative Luhan.
For a do pass on house Bill 164
as amended, and second by.
Representative Barrego, go ahead
and call.
Yes.
Representative Block, yes, and
I'd like to explain my vote.
Or a borego.
Representative Lu Han.
Representative Mejia.
Yes.
Madame Floor leader, yes.
Representative Zamora.
Yes, and I'd like to explain my
vote.
Madam Vice Chair, yes, Madam
Chair.
Representative block to explain
your vote. Thank you so much,
Madam Chair and thank you, Mr.
Whit for bringing this forward.
I, I support the intent of your
legislation. I, I still have
some of those concerns about
solvency, and I think we can, we
can probably iron those out. I
do want to continue to
hopefully, if you can in the
future talk to the para board
and folks at Pera to see maybe
what we could do this
legislation, legislative session
to put an extra appropriation
somewhere in the budget to help
with that, the core of that fund
to make sure that we can indeed
have
those funds in the future for
folks, and I certainly don't
want some county or city
employees to have to have an
insolvent fund since it's all in
one place and that's a big
concern of mine, but I do
support our pair of retirees,
state, local, county, and I
think that this is something
that's very important and I'm
glad it's going forward. So
thank you all and I appreciate
you. Thank you, Madam Chair.
His name Samoa.
Madam Chair, thank you. And I
have the same concerns as
Representative Block.
And us funding this for 5 years
and letting it drop off.
The cliff again, uh.
to me is, is a temporary fix
and, and I don't like temporary
fixes on such an important
issue. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative, and
um
With Martinez, you have a Du
pass as amended House Bill 164.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee, and I, uh,
will continue the conversation
with uh
members of the Republican caucus
on how the funding will work.
What happens after the 5 years,
but thank you for your
indulgence. I appreciate it. Um.
Representatives Chairman Small.
House Bill 181, you're in the
hot seat.
And please let us know how many
amendments you have. Thank you,
Madam Chair. It's great to be
here with you and your
committee. I appreciate the
opportunity. Um, uh, Madam
Chair, I'm here to present House
Bill 181. I do want to note.
Uh, Madam Chair, that we have,
uh, Deputy Director Doctor John
Courtney from the LFC LFC, of
course, is nonpartisan Doctor
Courtney, this is LSC endorsed
legislation and Doctor Courtney
is here to answer any questions.
Uh, Madam Chair and committee.
Um, House Bill 181 is a simple
bill that requires
accountability from our
executive partners in the
expenditure of grow, uh,
appropriations. These are grow
projects or 3-year pilot
projects that test out
approaches uh to improve
outcomes for New Mexicans, um.
And HB 181 will require in
statute DFA and LFC to work
together on instructions for
agencies to develop
accountability and evaluation
plans to share these evaluations
plan, uh, Madam Chair and
committee, and really
importantly, uh, as we get to
the three-year time frame for
the different grow
appropriations to report back to
the legislature, uh, with
evaluations determining whether
or not.
The investments worked to what
degree they worked and therefore
to then help us uh dedicate or
choose not to rededicate funding
moving forward.
With that, Madam Chair, I would
stand for questions.
Thank you. Let's go to the
audience for comments and
support of the bill in the
opposition of the bill, seeing
none, let's go to Zoom.

House Bill 19.
Good morning.
Madam Chair Johnson, if you're
prepared, please proceed. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Thank you,
members of the committee, um,
I'm here with uh Chairwoman
Johnson to present House Bill
194, um, just a little bit of
housekeeping really quick before
I dive into the presentation for
um the majority members of the
committee, the
Caucus analysis was printed up
under for this bill for 194 was
printed up under 181, so it's in
your 181 section of your binder.
I just noticed that, um.
So moving forward.
House Bill 194.
Permits the cultural expression.
Of regalia at graduation.
And other promotion ceremonies.
It is a very straightforward
bill, um.
We all know, especially here in
New Mexico with our indigenous
communities, the importance of
being able to wear your regalia
and the pushback that many
members of our communities have
gotten in this regard, and
that's one of the reasons why I
am so proud to co-sponsor that
is because it is not only for
our indigenous communities, it
is for our Asian-American
communities and our African
American communities, and it is
very important to the people of
New Mexico that we be allowed to
express ourselves and our
heritage and our culture.
Without um.
Any resistance and certainly
without any punishment.
And with that, I believe we
stand for questions. Oh, we have
an expert if you'd like to
introduce yourself. I'm so
sorry.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee. Good morning. I'm
Joseph Monette. I'm the cabinet
secretary for the Indian Affairs
department and we are ecstatic
to hope that this bill gets
pushed through this session, and
I will take any questions you
have.
Thank you. Thank you committee
members and Madam Vice Chair and
I just would like to say that.
Our cultural regalia.
Um, is a right to our self
expression.
And it's a way that we uh
maintain our dignity and honor
our individual identities or
families or communities or
tribes, pueblos and um.
A way that we express who we are
and where we come from, and it
pertains to our cultural,
religious, and, uh, spiritual.
Birthrights. Thank you very
much.
Thank you, Madam Chairs and
sponsors and expert witnesses.
Um, I would like to go to the
audience, please, for those in
support, please signify by
raising your hand.
Right?
And we will provide one minute
for comment.
Try to talk fast. Good morning,
committee chair and committee
members. My name is Bernard
Hardy, A is Pablo Dena. I'm also
a mother. I'm here with Animated
to vote or and we're here in
support in this uh HB 194
indigenous students face dis
Disproportionate outcomes.
Across a range of educational
statistics, including higher
rates of exclusionary discipline
and lower graduation rates due
to history of abuse of
indigenous students in schools,
our government has special
obligation to address ongoing
negative treatment of our
indigenous students, educational
and expressive rights are and
this bill is a direct response
to Yasi Martinez. New Mexico
thrives off the tourist dollars
of our native tribes and Pueblos
yet still.
In educational spaces, our
indigenous youth are denied
representation, and one of those
most important times in their
young life.
Please support. Thank you.
Madam Chair, committee members,
my name is Jasmine Tying Fong.
I'm an attorney with the ACLU
New Mexico, and the ACLU of New
Mexico fully supports HB 194. As
you may know, many native
American students in New Mexico
and across the nation, often
where tribal tribal regalia to
commemorate significant
milestones and lifetime
achievements, adorning one's
headwear with feathers and beads
during high school graduation
ceremonies, for example, is a
cultural practice shared among
many.
indigenous people. In fact, 17
other states have laws that
permit Native American students
to wear tribal regalia during
any high school event. New
Mexico, however, does not. We
believe H1 HB 194 is long
overdue. Considering the fact
that there are 323 federally
recognized tribal nations in the
state of New Mexico, and more
than 30,000 Native American
students enrolled in state
public schools. A state of New
Mexico must do more to protect
the cultural practices of Native
American students against.
discrimination in school by
allowing them to wear a tribal
regalia. Thank you.
God's sake.
Uh, good morning, uh, Madam
Chair, Madam Vice Chair, members
of the committee. My name is
Conroy Chino.
And I represented Pueblos of Ama
and Taos, and also the center
for Law and Poverty, and we
stand in full support of the
legislation before you.
Primarily because it protects
the students' expression of um
of the freedom of expression.
Um, whether it's wearing
traditional tribal clothing or a
cultural item on a graduation
camp, but also allows a student
And
Um, a way or a means of
expressing trouble identity and
trouble affiliation, but more
than anything,
HB 194 protects them from
harassment and discrimination at
a very celebratory time and
moment in their young academic
lives. So for those reasons,
Madam Chair, I Madam vice chair,
we support this legislation.
Um, good morning, everyone. My
name is Katie Anne Moniko. I'm
the assistant secretary for
Indian Education at the New
Mexico Public Education
Department. We stand in full
support of the bill.
Thank you very much. Uh, is
there anyone in the opposition?
To this film.
All right. Thank you so much.
Uh, it appears we have.
Thank you very much, sir. We
have public comment in on Zoom.
Jeanette Williams, can you hear
us?
Yes. This is Janet Williams with
the National Organization for
Women and we are in strong
support of this bill. Thank you
very much. Janet.
Thank you very much. Uh, all
right. Committee members.
Mhm
We have
a committee substitute.
Um
Uh, maybe have a motion to move
in a or have passed out. You
need to pass out the committee
substitute my apologies
committee members.
We, um, were late in getting our
community substitute printed.
Remove the committee substitute.
Thank you, Representative Brego.
A copy.
Apologies, everyone, we are
having a rough day.
All right. Does everyone have a
copy?
Thank you. Um,
Madam Chair.
Madam Vice Chair,
Madam Vice Chair and Madam
Chair.
With all due respect.
The committee substituted so
long that we can't.
We can't read it right now and,
and make a decision.
Uh
Madam Chair, Madam Vice Chair,
can we roll this bill and, and
let us, give us a chance to read
this committee substitute.
Um, representative, it's very
simple. Can we give it a shot at
explaining to you and then maybe
we can decide. I'd like to
secretary to explain.
OK, thank you. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you, Madam Vice
Chair.
amendment.
Thank you.
Um, Chair, do we move the
Discussion for the substitute.
Let's just make this complete.
This will be a, now we will move
to discussion.
Thank you.
Madame Chair Representative, um,
the, the bill that you have
sitting before you as or I'm
sorry, HB 194, uh, I believe has
been modified to mimic SB 163,
which is tribal regalia at
school events, and so I will
briefly in your packets on, and
I'm sorry, we didn't add our
page numbers to this, uh, but I
believe it's the 3rd slide in
the packet that we presented to
you all, um, from the Indian
Affairs department.
It has, um,
It modifies
A men's section 22-5-4.3, and it
allows students to wear their
regalia, but the language from
the main parts of the bill are
located right there, so that's
the language that's implemented
or that's asked to be
substituted into the um into
the, into the amended bill that
allows uh local school boards
and governing boards or charter
schools shall not prohibit uh
student who is enrolled are
eligible for enrollment in a
federally recognized Indian
tribe from wearing tribal
regalia.
objects of cultural significance
along with, um, with or attached
to a cap or gown or wearing
tribally significant footwear or
other items of apparel under a
gown at graduation ceremonies
are public school events. It
also um defines what tribal
regalia is.
The other thing that the bill
does is, um, removes the
definition of race and according
to uh LCS, uh, people that we
were working with is that that's
an antiquated definition of
race, and so it cleans up the
bill, uh, I'm sorry, it cleans
up this section a little bit to
uh remove that language, um, in
short.
Thank you.
Thank you, and we'll go to the
committee.
Representative Fuhan.
Ma'am, I just want to say this.
This is great. I, I attended uh
high school Native American, uh,
high school and so this is a.
When news and things have come
up in in regard to this, I just
want to say it was, it was
pretty shameful and not anything
I had, I had ever experienced
because we celebrated all
cultures, but primarily a Native
American um cultures in our, in
our states and actually national
cause we had students, um.
That were, uh, nationally
attending the school and the
pride and the care of, of uh
cultural representation and, and
It was just incredible, the most
incredible experiences in my
life, and I just say whenever we
can do something.
And to me, it's like, it's
unfortunate we have to move to a
piece of legislation like this,
but it's necessary as well, and
I, and I have all due respect to
those who are bringing this
forward and have concern with
this.
Um, it, it's, um, to me it's,
it's what should always have
been and should remain in place
when we, we need to represent
our cultures and, and, uh, I
fully, fully 100 50 million%
support this. Thank you, Ma.
Thank you, Representative, uh,
Representative Zamora.
Thank you, Madam Chair, Vice
Chair, Madam Chair.
So
So, I, I like the bill and I
like what you're doing.
But my concerns are, what about
the rest of the cultures in the
state of New Mexico.
Madam Chair, Madam Vice Chair,
Madam Chair, how do you feel
about that?
Terry Monet.
Madam Chair, uh, Representative.
IED has said multiple times to
other people, we would
absolutely support any other
culture that would be interested
in passing something similar.
This one we are doing
specifically for Native American
students, uh, as you'll see it
talks specifically about
members, um, or those who are
eligible for membership in a
federally recognized tribe. We
do that because um,
In, in the last several years,
the political classification of
Native American people has been,
um,
Uh, had to be really fought for
to maintain, um, we wanted to
ensure that we were protecting
those rights of those Native
American students and
distinguishing between um to
some extent that that political
classification and ensuring that
our native students, and of
course, as we know, there was an
incident that happened, um, this
past year with a graduating
student, uh, and just to kind of
add on a little bit to what was
talked about earlier about the
importance and the significance
of being able to wear something
where I come from being able to
to wear an eagle feather
represents an honor, and it's an
honor that your family bestows
upon you. It's an honor that
you're able to do. So when I
graduated from law school, my
family gave me my first eagle
feather and only Native American
people are allowed to own eagle
feathers. And so being able to
do that is a way to represent
yourself and show honor to
yourself and for your family to
show honor to you. And so, um, I
think that's one reason why
we're sticking with this, but
again, I wanna reiterate I
absolutely stands with all other
people.
And Madam Chair,
So,
can I dovetail on that, and I
have attended various uh
graduation ceremonies, uh,
post-secondary.
And kindergarten, high school,
and I have seen other cultures
in our state of New Mexico,
where they're regalia or
cultural significant attire, and
there never has been, it seems
like a question or a concern as
there was in the last incident.
So that's how this discussion
was brought forward and this
bill was developed.
And Madam Chair, and, and I
support what you're doing. I
support the bill.
But my concerns are
Why don't we treat the whole
state?
When, when we're doing
legislation, why don't we treat
the whole state the same way.
Uh
So many like this is singling
out.
Certain cultures of the state.
And, and there's other cultures,
uh, what about, what about the
Mexican people and their
cultures, uh, the Hispanos that
were, I think they all fit in
the same category, Hispanos,
Mexicans, and
Some people like to get
get classified differently, but
what about the Hispanic culture
in the state.
Uh
There's, there's other cultures
in the state that
That are gonna come back and
say, well, why, why did you do
this for them but not for us.
And
So
I'm afraid of maybe some
lawsuits being filed or
Or something in the future
because of this legislation and
Uh
I just lost my train of thought.
Would you believe that?
I
Madam, oh sorry, I'm sorry, go
ahead, madam chair.
Madam Chair Representative, if I
may, um,
As I am
A very proud co-sponsor on this
bill, um, and not a member of
the indigenous community, I
think in your question, you
pointed out exactly the need for
this legislation, you said
singled out.
And the reason why we bring this
bill forward is because members
of our indigenous community have
been singled out in their own
state.
The land that they are directly
tied to.
They have been singled out for.
Expressing their cultural
heritage.
In the land that they have come
from.
And that is why we bring this
bill.
That is why it's worded as such.
If you're going to single out
the people who are indigenous to
this land.
And punish them for expressing
their cultural heritage.
Then we need to make sure that
they are protected as um.
As Chair Johnson pointed out, I
too have seen.
Cultural expressions in similar
situations to graduation
ceremonies, um.
As I mentioned before, the Asian
American community and the
African American community. I've
seen it go both ways. I've seen
those children not be singled
out and celebrated for their
cultural heritage and that
expression, um.
And I have seen them singled
out. And my hope is that if we
can.
At the very
Protect the people.
Who come from this land.
And their expression and
celebration.
Of their heritage.
Then we will not have to do
that.
Going forward
Or other cultures and other
heritages.
So you essentially the purpose
of this legislation is to
And put out the fire in front of
us. Um, and then that's why
we're bringing this forward,
Madam Chair Representative.
So, Madam Chair, Madam Vice
Chair, Madam Chair. So
If, if we have a graduation in
Clovis.
And
All the students are required to
wear a cap and gown.
There's a Native American.
student
That
Wears his regalia.
Is he gonna wear it under the
cap and gown?
Or, or is, or is this student
Going to wear his regalia and
put the cap and gown to the
side, Madam chair.
Madam Chair Representative, my
understanding generally, most
students are proud to wear their
cap and gown as well when
they're graduating, so they
would likely and most instances
that I've seen students where
their regalia underneath their
cap and gown other than
sometimes they have a beaded cap
or again, as we've mentioned
before, having a um like a
feather attached to your cap as
well. Uh, that's what this
provides the opportunity for it
also allows the opportunity for
um students to wear moccasins.
My son just
gra du ated from a public school
APS uh this past year and, um,
young men were required to wear
slacks and um dress shoes. This
allows the opportunity for our
native students to be able to
wear their moccasins, their
traditional moccasins to to
their graduation ceremonies, um,
if they so choose, and, and
representative just to uh really
quickly and uh Madam Chair, to
quickly you know, um, so this
bill, again, it does protect the
right for Native American
students to be able to.
Wear the regalia. Uh, what it
doesn't do is tell schools that
they have to limit it to that.
So if schools so chose and
decided that they wanted to
expand, um, or apply it more
openly or broadly to um to other
students. I, I think that would
be within their purview as well.
Thank you.
Oh, Madam Vice Chair and Madam
Chair. So this goes back to, to
my
Discussion earlier is, this is
the thirteen-page bill and can
you tell me where the schools
can require cap and ground, cap
and gown over the regalia.
Can you point that out to me?
Madam Chair Representative, I
cannot, I do not believe that it
states that specifically.
So, so,
So then the debate, Madam Chair
and the expert witness would be.
How, what is really the dress
code at a graduation.
If the school decides that there
will be a cap and gown.
Even though they can wear the
regalia and do everything else.
And maybe, maybe.
Put something on the cap, but
not, not.
That they have to wear the gown
or
Madam Chair Representative, the
dress code for a graduation
ceremony is up to the school,
this language just allows for
students to wear their regalia
in addition to the cap and gown.
OK, and, and, and if I may,
sorry, it's not a 13 page bill
is really just the one section
on page 4, and subsequently
updating language.
That has been antiquated and
outdated.
Oh, and page 5.
So if I may, representative
Zamora.
This bill does not.
Specifically say that students
graduating from
institutions of um
Schools are not going to be
wearing their cap and gown. They
are still gonna be wearing their
cap and gown. They're just gonna
be wearing their traditional
regalia or um a representation
of it if they choose. We still
are going to respect the cap and
gown.
Formality of a graduation
ceremony.
Thank you, Madam Vice Chair and
thank you, Madam Chair, for
that. And we see students, some,
some wear their shorts, some
wear their cowboy outfits,
somewhere, you know, different
clothes and
Thank you for bringing this bill
forward and, and helping me
understand and
at the same time. Thank you.
I think you representative, uh,
Representative Lu Han, uh, thank
you for the 2nd time, Madam
Chair. I, I just like to draw
out on page 5.
Uh, section J with the concern
that I'm hearing I'm sorry, uh.
Representative, we have a
representative block on the
list. I apologize.
Are you
Thank you. Uh, I just wanted to
draw out. I should have said on
that 0.1 of the points, but.
Um, it does, um, include
cultural or religious
headdresses. I mean, if you look
into those.
Um, definitions, it, it does
cover multicultures is is am I
reading that correctly, Madam
Chair.
Madam Chair Representative, um,
yes, it does cover multiple
cultures that's already in
statute, um, if you look at page
5,
section J Adam 2 protective
hairstyles, that was the Crown
Act that we did just about 3
years ago. So yes, um, thank
you. Other cultures are already
covered in the statutes, madam.
Thank you.
The key representative
representative.
Black
Thank you so much, Madam chair,
and uh thank you. And first of
all, I just want to
I
I don't really like the way that
this uh substitute was put
forward because it, I didn't
really have time to read it and
I, I, I guess I'll waive any
kind of opposition to that, and
I won't, won't blow a gasket or
anything, but I do think that
I would love more time even
though I know it's just tweaking
some language, but other than
that, Madam Chair, I do think
that this is super
Important. I think that this is
very good, especially for
cultures to be able to express
themselves at these events,
these graduation events. I mean,
these are big things in people's
lives. This is saying you've
earned.
A credentials so that you can go
forward in life. And I think
being there with your family and
also
Taking in your culture as well
with you, because a lot of the
time in the past, there has been
a prohibition on that kind of
Both ways, right? I can be who I
am.
While also getting a degree from
a university in the state or a
charter school, etc. So I think
that's something that's very
critical. And so, Madam Chair
Representative, I guess my, my
big questions were just the
stricken language, but I did
hear that it was clarified and
we said it was antiquated.
Wasn't this this language, you
know, bill just a couple of
years ago though. I, I know that
we updated the statute for, for
hairstyles and cultural
hairstyles. I'm just wondering
why we kept that in there last
time, Madam Chair, and this is
just an off the wall.
I, I don't know if we have
answers, Madam Chair.
Um, well, as you're referencing,
you know, why we didn't update
antiquated language earlier.
Better late than never, Madam
Chair Representative.
OK, thank you so much, Madam
Chair, and that's, that's all
the questions I had. Thank you
all for bringing this forward,
and you have the support from
me, of course.
Thank you, Representative, uh,
Representative Brego.
Thank you Madam Vice Chair and
Madam Chair and uh
representative, um, I think that
this bill is um a really good
deal. I think that it's time
that, uh, you know, we
acknowledge that and, and I just
wanted to point out on page 4 at
the bottom line 24 says, um, and
just kind of representative
Zamora's question about
Do they wear the the cap and
gown or or their uh cultural
regalia, it says, um, very
specifically, it says triber
pueblo from wearing tribal
regalia or objects of cultural
significance along with or
attached to a cap or gown.
So it's clear to me that, you
know, you can wear your cap and
gown, but you can also have some
expression and freedom to
show who you are in your
culture, um.
I it's kind of, kind of laughing
in my head, Madam Chair and
Madam my chair is like, well,
does that mean I get to wear my
My uh tiara, if I really wanted
to, um, but I think you know you
never know, right? It's not just
sitting on the shelf, um, and
that's when I was a little girl.
I just, I'm just joking, um, but
I think what's important about
the bill is that it does give
credence to other cultures, you
know, even though it's right
now, it's, it's focusing on
Native American culture. It
gives credence to other
cultures, and I think that.
Uh, representatives of more that
doesn't preclude us from
introducing another bill that
allows it to open up to all
cultures. Um, I think this is
just kind of the first step of
of doing that, and I'd be happy
to work with you on that bill if
you, if you'd like.
Well thank you Madam, uh, Chair.
See, Madam vice chair, madam
chair and representative.
Thank you very much. So
committee members, we're looking
for action.
Maybe we do pass.
Right? Just for clarification,
we, this is uh the motion will
be for a do not pass on
substitute for House Bill 194.
Thank you. Oh, and the
amendment, uh, the committee
substitute at 230318.1. Thank
you. And please call Ro.
