Good morning, everyone.
Welcome to the
second meeting of
the
transportation infrastructure and
revenue sub-committee. Thank you all for
being here. Sorry, I'm late, but I guess
it didn't matter because
we have a problem with
communications here
and parking.
So this is supposed to be the flagship
University of the of
New
Mexico.
Um I'll leave it at
that. You
can draw your own conclusions.
So here we
are and we
have a interesting agenda
today.
Um The afternoon
is uh filled
with electric
vehicles
and um I was the first
state legislator to buy uh
electric vehicles
eight years, six years
ago
when online, I couldn't even find
one used Tesla in the
state,
found tons of
them in Dallas,
Phoenix
and
Denver
ended up buying one in Dallas.
So they're looking forward to
that.
And the first item
this morning is a
report from district
one,
one engineer
report
and
we have
Aaron
pronounce
that.
I'm sorry, I can't pronounce your name.
My English is terrible and
my Spanish is even
worse.

So take it away.
>> You got it, Mr Chairman.
Good morning members of the committee. Good
morning, Rick Padilla, executive director
for Highway Operations at NM
dot And we're here
this morning to provide some
district updates, some district
presentations on
our districts, one and two,
Southeast and Southwest
New Mexico. So without further
ado, Mr chairman, we'll go ahead and move
forward. This is Mr Aaron
Chaara. He is our district one
engineer,
>> Mr Chair uh
members of the sub-committee. Good
morning. Uh I
appreciate the opportunity
uh to be here in front of you and
present uh my
district
um as
Mr Baria
said, I am
Ain Chaara, I am the district
one engineer.
Um We'll begin on page
one.
Chandel Cisneros is our
district one commissioner.
Uh on this page you
also see the, the map
for district one
boundaries.
Uh District one
is headquartered in, in Demme,
New Mexico and it encompasses
the southwester portion
of, of New Mexico.
We have uh Donan
County, Luna County
Grant County,
uh Hidalgo County,
Socorro County
in a small, the southern
tip of Catron
County.
Uh We, we border
Arizona on the
west uh
and then Texas on
the southern east
part of the, of the
district.
We, we share approximately
100 and 80 miles of
international border with
Mexico.
Uh We have three international
ports of entries, uh
Santa Teresa,
Columbus and Antelope
Wells.
Our, our district is composed
of four sections. We have our
program support,
construction
maintenance and engineering
support. We have a total of
297
positions.
We have 12 maintenance
patrols. We have four
construction crews
and we oversee 12 rest
areas in our district.
On the lower right
is our budget uh
breakdown for our
district
and we'll move on to page
two.
These are the our legislative
funding uh beginning in
2019
for 2019.
Uh all these, all these
projects have been completed
uh
20.3
million on the top
table and 14.9
million on the bottom
table.
Moving on to page
three, we
continue our laws
with 2020.
All these projects have been
completed for 19.9
million.
The Laws of 2021
half of those projects have
already been completed.
The other three will
be completed this
year.
Laws of 2022
we received 29 million
for our US 180
project.
That project has been
awarded and it should be breaking
ground this this
year
and then uh loss of
2023
we received 28
million. And this
is our New Mexico 213
corridor.
The, the new Mexico
213 is uh
it's, it's, it's an extension of our
new Mexico 404
project. Uh It
goes into Texas
tear is building a new, a
brand new roadway. Uh
That's gonna bypass the
city of El Paso and they're
gonna tie into the, our new
Mexico 213.
So it's a significant
uh project for
us.
Uh Page
four,
we continue with our laws
of 24.
Uh The top tables
are our capital projects. We
received 4 million.
Uh The next table is
our uh our maintenance
projects. We received
18.5 million.
Uh All these projects
uh We anticipate they're gonna be
completed this
year.
We move on to
uh our completed maintenance
projects.
Oh,
these uh you know, we have a
variation of uh
fencing, chipseal
bridge and pavement, rehab,
preservation,
landscaping
a total of
20.1 million that
we completed this past
year.
Page five
is our, our upcoming
contract maintenance projects.
We have a
total of 20
28.2 this
year. One of these
projects that I'd like to highlight for
you guys is our new Mexico
549 project.
This is the uh
this route is uh
from Demming to Las
Cruces. It's old
uh uh Las Cruces
Highway. Over the past
few years, we've been doing a lot
of rehabilitation in this projects.
10 mile increments.
This is a chip sealed
road. It had no
shoulders. So we were
able to go in there
and do a full depth
reclamation and
add 4 ft shoulders.
And this uh this is the
last segment
that will complete that
corridor.
And it's significant to the district
because when I 10
shuts down between Demon and
Las Cruces. This is
our detour
route
page six,
we move on to our
construction projects.
We have a total of
71.2 that
we uh closed out this
past year.
Uh There's a couple on here
that uh I'd like to
highlight. The first one
is our, our roundabouts and
truth or consequences.
We, we constructed
33 roundabouts
in the city.
Uh Originally, it, it
was not very popular.
Uh But uh
as we, we moved along with
the study and the design,
uh those, those roundabouts
were the perfect solution for
the problems that the city was
having in our roadway
a few weeks ago, we
had a ribbon cutting
uh and I might be a little biased,
but I mean, that project looks,
looks great.
The, the next one I'd
like to highlight for you guys is our
I 10 Corridor. The
TPA, it's
a truck parking availability
system.
Uh This,
this project
is um, we're
installing
uh cameras at rest
areas. Uh
and we have a message
boards, variable message boards
and there's a picture of one down
at the bottom right of your
uh on page
six. So
it, let's uh it provides
uh parking availability at
the upcoming rest
areas for
truckers. So, so
they don't have to pull over.
Uh they know in advance
where those parking spaces are
available. This
is a, a multis state
project. We have
California,
Arizona, New Mexico and
Texas.
And I'm proud to say that New
Mexico was the first to complete
and implement this project. We,
we were done in February of this
year.
Page seven, we
have our ongoing construction
projects.
Um We have 258
million of ongoing
construction projects and they're,
they're spread out
within six
counties.
Uh There's a couple of projects
on here that uh
that have been completed
uh after
the uh this
presentation was
uh was turned in and that's a
404
project that one's been completed.
They're doing a final walk through this
week and also
our landscaping project in Las
Cruces. Uh They did a final
walkthrough last week. So those
will be coming off this list
soon.
Page eight is
our,
our fy 2425
projects. These
are, are basically
as a copy of our
I,
we have approximately
364 million in
upcoming projects.
Uh Several of these
and, and several of the other uh
tables that you guys see. We
have a lot of interstate
projects.
We, we do have a
300 a combined
339 miles of
centerline miles of
interstates, which is
a challenge for the
district.
But we've been,
every year. We, we, we
do uh some interstate
work.
Uh There is a new project
on this list. Um
It's our border connector
highway. It's
gonna be connecting
uh New Mexico
136 P. Dominicci
into the city of Sunland
Park to New Mexico
273.
The, it's going to be the
connection at
136 is going to be about
two miles north of the
border.
The
Santerre port of entry is
currently going under a feasibility
study for an
expansion
and uh
modernization.
So the the proposal
is that when that project
gets, gets complete,
we're gonna have 16 lanes
of traffic going in the
northbound direction
and two lanes of traffic
crossing the border in the
southbound direction.
Um That's a significant
increase to our current
uh two lane crossing that
we have right now.
Also in that area. We
have the Donan uh
Jetport,
the Union Pacific Rail
Yard. We have
the Santa Teresa
International Livestock
Crossing and the Santa
Teresa Industrial Park.
And all these uh these
have seen growth in the last
few
years.
Page nine, we move
on to our uh
projects that
are
being designed uh
or engineered.
Um The,
the border connector highways
on here. Uh
It, it will uh it's still
undergoing final design but
it's gonna be uh
uh it's projected to bid
next fall.
And then the other interesting project
we have is our EV
charging stations.
We received a grant from
the US DT charging
and uh fueling
infrastructure uh
program
uh 63.8
million.
Uh
We're going to be building two
charging stations,
uh centers, two
charging centers, one
will be in Lordsburg and one will
be near Vado. Each
will have 27
charging stations.
Each will have nine pull
through uh charging
stations for
heavy duty or, or,
or commercial trucks.
Uh It's part of a
bigger the I 10
Electric Corridor which will
be the nation's first uh
network of high powered
charging centers for
heavy duty trucks.
Uh And it's the, the
concept is to come from
California, from the San Pedro
ports to
El Paso,
Texas.
The next list
uh still on page
nine is our
unfunded projects
that we're, we're
designing.
Um The first two
that you see on there is
our, our interstates.
Um This is what remains
for for the district
to do rehabilitation on
our interstates
every year. We, we
do uh projects, we break them
down into 10 or 15 mile
projects and we,
we, we shove them,
we uh and
our strategy is to,
to use redistribution or
close out money or, or
if there's additional money we're shovel
ready for those
projects.
Our, our next
uh next one, we have uh
Nogal Canyon on
here last week,
we just found out that
we were the recipients
of the Bridge
Investment Program grant.
We received uh close to
$72 million for that
project. It doesn't
fully fund the project, but
it's going to be a significant help
to us uh getting that
project
constructed.
Page 10 is
our uh our local government
road fund on
here. You'll see a
our County Cooper
program, our municipal
Arterial program,
our County Arterial
Program, our
Safe Bus Routes program
and the others program.
Uh These aren't very big
funds but
the entities are very good.
Uh Doing as much
as possible with what they
receive
on page 11. We move
on to our Transportation
project fund.
The first list you see is
our uh 2020 our
fy 23
distribution,
we were able to fund 22
projects with at uh for
16 entities
for a total of 17.5
million.
Uh for fy
24
we, we funded 13
projects for 13
entities at a total
cost of 11, 11.5
million. Uh This
year, uh The
districts have already
ranked the
TPF projects.
Uh They will go to the State
Transportation Commission for approval
this coming
month.
Page 12 is
a uh the,
the district
one map and it
just uh it was just to
depict the
where our funds are going.
Uh Local government road fund
TPF
completed construction
and completed maintenance
projects. Um
We have a pretty good distribution
around the, our district
for those. And then the table
at the bottom right
shows uh
uh the totals for the
county
page 13.
These are our equipment
needs
for our district. It's not
an all inclusive list.
We, we continually
need to, to
upgrade equipment or add
to our fleets or,
or new type of machinery
uh as needed.
But it's a, it's a short
list for about $10
million
uh Mr Chair
and that completes my presentation.
So I'll stand for any
questions,
presentation
>> and uh,
we
introduce,
ok, so we
have someone
who came in after we
started and
you want to introduce yourself.
Representative
Garcia.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair,
uh, committee
members, Harry Garcia. I
represent House District
69 which covers
parts of Juan mckinneys,
Bernard, New Soor
Counties. Thank you for
being here today. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Do you have
questions?
We don't do that
later?
Oh, we have a
question from uh, Senator
Woods.
Anybody else on the list?
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair.
So your, your
capital
that you are kind
of asking for is the 10
million. It's not the
total amount that you need,
but that's at least
the equipment capital.
How about your buildings?
How about your infrastructure
other than
at your patrol yards?
Are you asking for any capital
for
that?
>> Uh Mr Chair,
Senator, we
are currently working on a five
year plan at the district
to come up with those totals
for our facilities
Um, and we, uh,
hopefully we can, uh,
implement the plan
and we can come up with totals for
our facilities.
Um, as far as the equipment
list. Yes. It,
right now it's just a 10, we
capped it at 10 million.
Um, but there, it,
it's greater than 10
million. >> Can.
Can you give me an
idea, Mr Chair?
Can you give me an idea
of approximately how
many contractors, different
contractors you have
working within your district
right
now?
And you can get back to
me. I don't want to put you
on that big spot. >> Mr
Chair, Senator. That, that was a good
question. I, uh, we
have several, we have a lot of
ongoing projects right now, so we have
several. I just, I
have to get back to you with
that. >> Ok.
Yeah, I'd like to have a list of
those contractors if you
would.
Uh,
on page 13, I
think you need to put a paint
job on that piece of equipment
there.
I, uh,
I know you've got a big district and
a lot to do and especially
on that,
uh, uh, international
crossings that you have.
Um, have we
done anything on
the diversion
dam at
Columbus? I
know that there was some problems
with that flooding coming
off in that area.
Have we have, we,
it may be out of
your jurisdiction
all altogether,
but I know it did
cause problems at that
crossing there.
>> Mr Chair
Senator,
the, that, that project
is being led by Luna
County. Uh
We have been
involved. They're,
they're building
AAA Drainage
crossing across New Mexico 11,
which is within our rightway.
We've also
been uh courtesy
reviewing some of their
uh documents uh
that they, they've submitted as
far as design.
Um It's, it's, it's
moving forward that BEM
project as we
speak.
>> Ok.
Ok, Mr
Chairman, thank you very much
for the opportunity.
>> Oh, thank you, Senator. Next up,
we have representative
nostro followed by Representative
Allison.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I did
have a couple of questions
and probably best
for Mr Padilla. I'm I'm
interested uh Mr
Chairman,
obviously for
me under sec the
section nine funding
that was provided to this
district. I'm
curious how much of that
was ever uh
generally
uh redefined
than what we'd actually put into the
bill
because I know at one time when you
guys were short with money,
we had to move money around.
And so are
these projects, all the
projects that were identified
in the bill
for these various years,
Mr >> Chairman Representative,
no, there were several projects
that we included.
Um
We had some leeway in the
language if you can remember. So we
did find some projects that weren't on the
list, but I know
um if they were in
the bill, we touched them
somehow some way if it was
a little maintenance project or,
or whatever it is, we could
do. We, we touched them all but
we did some other projects.
>> So Mr Chairman, my,
my question on this is
that we do and I'm
glad we've allowed the
department to make some
adjustments outside of what
was the specific language
in the section nine
of the General Appropriations
Act?
Um How many
of these projects were nost
state
projects,
>> Mr Chairman and Representative?
That's a good question. I know
there were a few of them that were
local projects. I don't think
it was more than, you know,
two or three at that
time. Um
But there were a few included in the
bill. >> And my question, Mr
Chairman is
that now
that it's called Section
69
and the General Appropriations
Act, local projects
are not included.
It's been deemed that
they have to be state
only. I
think that's wrong.
And I think that
if these projects bubble
up through the appropriate
process with an
R uh RPO
or MP O,
however, they, they get
to the
forefront of the
bill that goes into
the General Appropriations
Act. That's
consistent with what the
district wants also.
It's not somebody out there
cooking up a project
that the district engineer wouldn't
agree with. We have a
project like that. Now in
Gallup mckinley County, that's a
bridge project
that was put into the bill
last year.
No fault of the
department. But there's
politics around that
project and I'm hoping that
we can get that
resolved.
The other question I had,
Mr Chairman is in
regard to cattle
guards. That was a
big deal, Mr
Padilla, you, you recall
in house transportation
in rural New Mexico,
a lot of these cattle guards
are in state ride of
ways and a lot
of our rural folks have
asked that, you know, they have
some help
with those things being cleaned out. What
what's happening on that
on, on that status of cattle
guards.
>> Mr Chairman and Representative,
I'll defer to the
secretary.
>> Thanks Mr Chairman, Representative.
Great question. So we have an
agreement that's being moved back
and forth between us and mckinley
county for a list
of, I
want to say 30 kettle guards,
Lisa. Is that about right?
There are 30 kettle guards that
exist off of
New Mexico Road
right away
on me, asset right away
that either are
on county roads or private
drives. We've
identified the
30
cattle guards and we're working
on an agreement with mckinley County
to utilize
their resources
to get them cleaned with dot
Funding. The
big question surrounding
the agreement is
um ownership of the
cattle guard. So for
dot It's
inconsequential as far as
resources are concerned
because if ownership
is ours, then we'll
pay to get them cleaned. In this case,
we'll use mckinley County
resources.
If the cattle guards
are the counties and the
county needs help
financially to get them done,
then we're willing to support them
financially to get them done.
But as you can imagine
if we're not accurate about the
ownership, the agreement
does establish it so to
speak. And if there's liability,
then, you know, the agreement would
say, well, if you hit a
horse, this agreement here says
they belong to this group.
And so we're hopeful
to get that executed very quickly
so that we can get those 30 cattle
guards cleaned. There'll
be a dozen or so of them that are
replaced because they're in poor
condition and then
thereafter each of them will be
cleaned three times a
year.
>> Mr Chairman, that's a good
deal. I mean, we need that
in rural New Mexico,
any county I think is
eligible. Is that correct,
Mr >> Secretary
Mr Chair Representative Abso
Absolutely, if, if, if a
community comes to us and, and
we talk this out in Gallup
from a project gap
to an emergency situation
and the cattle guards,
we consider our, our, our a
priority
because there's already
been proven liability
with, with the
public being, you
know, uh impacted
by livestock in the roadways
and, and obviously
dot is
party to any litigation
uh on those issues. And
so that's why we're at the table trying
to resolve it. Thank >> you.
And one final thing, Mr
Chairman, I'm looking at page
nine, I just want to
point out for the benefit of the
committee projects and engineering
and design. That's, that's
1.2 billion,
right?
That's a lot.
And
so they're being designed
now and engineered.
Now, we're not
sure how these are going to get funded.
I assume there'll be some federal
money put into this and,
uh hopefully some state
money that goes into this
also. But
my hope is, is with those
additional dollars that
uh the state of New Mexico
has is that we're investing
them in
infrastructure, construction
and bridges. We
desperately need that throughout
the state. And
I'm glad that you put that in
there. I hope everybody else
does just so we get a sense of what
that total looks like
and this is in real
time right now.
So, all righty. Thank you,
Mr Chairman.
>> Thank you. Next up,
we have a representative
Allison to be followed
by Senator
G.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Uh
My question
also
is uh in relation
to cattle guards, I was
gonna ask you how
your district handle cattle
guards. I'm from
district five
and district
five and district six, the
majority of our road
of New Mexico 491
for example, runs through
the Navajo nation and
there's probably
uh more cattle
guards on that
stretch of road than there
is in half of New
Mexico.
And we
were told that it's the owner's
responsibility to clean
the cattle guards, but
not everybody
has a backhoe.
And
when you hear
when my constituents go
to visit uh a
field office in Shiprock,
for example,
first of all, we're
often told that we don't have the
manpower, New Mexico dot
does not have the manpower
to clean the cattle guards.
And then a constituent
goes to a field office
to fill a complaint.
They find the
crew, they playing
basketball.
I mean, so there's
something wrong with that picture.
And uh
anyway, I think
it's hard to place the responsibility
of maintaining cattle guards
on the
landowner, especially
on the Navajo nation
because the
majority of the people live in
poverty and they cannot
afford bag hoes and things
like that. So we
need every assistance
that we can get to clean
the categories.
I, I want
to make a
presentation before the
commissioners so
that uh maybe we
could uh amend
the statutes because I
know in statutes,
uh it says that it
is the responsibility of
landowners,
but maybe that's what, what is
necessary.
And then I, I think it's
good to see a report
such as this to
see so much work
going on in different
areas. And
it always seems to me that
there is more work
going on in
all districts
except district five
and six. I would
like to see a report
on this, uh covering
district five and six
to see what really is
going on.
Um
491 for
example, I've got relatives
in the to Hache area
and the stretch of road
south of uh
mile marker
67
is like the
back of an alligator.
So people drive
on the left lane,
they don't even use the right
lane because it's got
so much potholes and things
like that. The road is in
very, very, it's
worse than being called a bad
shape. And I'm just
wondering what, what kind
of projects is going on with
that. I'm glad to see
that there's progress being made
on highway 64
the bridge and,
uh, that stretch between
Shiprock and Tiss.
I'm glad to see that. But,
uh, I just
think that we need more work. And
then my,
uh, the reason why I bring this
up is I've got
less than four months
in my term to get as much
roadwork as I can possibly
get
the rock falls at
the Hogback area. Mr
Chair, we still
continue to see rock
falls every time
I complain to my district
engineer, he tells
me it's in, uh,
mitigation.
How many years are you
gonna mitigate a project before
actually getting it done?
I mean, I'm
tired of being told it's in mitigation
for almost six
years. I think
we need to
either
define what mitigation
means or just get the
problem fixed.
So, my complaint for
this morning, thank you, Mr
Chair.
Are you, uh, that's
your
ok >> next up. We have
a Senator.
Ok. >> Eagles followed
by Senator
>> Gonzale.
Thank you, Mr Chair. And thank you,
gentlemen. Uh, I want to go
back to conversation
that Senator Woods had
on the contractors and
I'm just wondering, and I know
it's probably this way
nationwide. But
do we have any delays due
to lack of contractors
here in New Mexico for your
in
district
>> Mr chairman and Senator. And
as of right now, no, we do
not, >> do not.
Um, just
follow up on that Mr Chair
and uh, Mr
Padilla. How many are we
doing that are out of
state
contractors
caveat on there? We
do roadwork, but I
don't want the job. Uh, but
I'm just wondering if, you know,
we've got a lot of outsiders
having to come in to fulfill the
needs we have here in New
Mexico. >> Mr chairman and
Senator, that
number is, is hard to provide
only because even the contractors
that we have in state, they
have home offices in the state
of New Mexico, whether, you
know, whether they have a sister or
a bigger, a bigger,
uh, company in another
state. They, they, most of them
do have a home office here
in the state of New Mexico and they
employ, uh, state
workers, um,
or, or New Mexico
workers. So I
would say probably 95%
of them are New Mexico based
contractors given
what I just said. Um,
and there are a few of the bigger ones that
are, that are here as >> well.
I appreciate that Mr Chair and I
guess the end of that is
as long as we've got
work and we're not
delaying. I'd like to have
the Mexicans looked at
primarily first, so
I appreciate that and love the
presentation so far. >> And
Mr Chairman, Senator,
if I could, we
do have the qualification
program in play
and that provides a
score to all the contractors that are
working in the state of New Mexico.
And based on that score,
you would assume that new
Mexico contractors,
um, you know, through the
award process would
receive most of those >> projects.
Thank you, Mr
Chair. Thank you.
>> Thank you.
Our next up is Senator Gonzalez,
followed by Representative
Garcia.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman
and thank you for the presentation.
I think one thing
that has always been,
uh you know, very
key to me and also
very important
is so the
purchase of equipment
and I see here
on your needs
and so how much was done
last
year,
>> Mr Chairman and Senator
and we appreciate your support with the
equipment. We did not receive
any additional funding last year out
of the session for equipment.
Um So we
just went off our San CB,
which is about 15
million, um,
and 15 million between six
districts including ourselves
and Santa Fe because we do
have the training academies.
Uh We do have our own fleet
out of the general office of Santa.
So it's like dividing
that number up by seven districts. So
it's not, we didn't get a lot done
this last year.
Um And as you know, our
equipment is aging
desperately. So I know one of
the things that uh the
secretary and I have been talking about it this
year's um, session is,
is trying to receive some more
money for, for equipment. I
mean, we have a, a drill
rig that we need desperately.
That's on a track system.
Basically, it's a track code drill
rig, um, that we need to,
uh, we use to core for
bridges, placement of
bridges and that piece
of equipment. My God,
we're keeping it together with duct tape,
but we're gonna need one here soon, but just
to build that alone is right
around roughly $2 million
alone. So
it doesn't go very far and we
are in desperate need of equipment moving
forward. >> Mr
Chairman. I just think
that, that it's a sad
day, you know, for all of us
here because I
have had several
times I have had
legislation even
one time where it was one
cent on an increase on
gas tax,
categorical going
to equipment,
which one cent would
just generate, you know,
enough just to keep it going.
And then we even tried with a
sunset and we couldn't even
support that.
And it just gets that
gap just gets, you know,
larger and larger.
And how do we
expect, you know, our, our
people to, to do the work
that is needed
and also the safety
to it, you know,
when, uh, when we don't
support that.
And I, I just feel it's
a sad day, you know, that we
can't even a one
cent increase to
the gas tax strictly for
our categorical.
And, you know,
I'm willing to try it
again and if it doesn't
go through it doesn't. But,
you know, I, I understand
the need and,
uh, and it's like
asking our ladies that
are here, our staff,
if they were to be doing the
work with a typewriter,
you know, versus to where we are
today, you know, with the
technology.
And it's just one of those
things, you know, that we
see that
and also
Mr Chairman to support
that is,
uh, once a year when you have
that, that
day, that you have
a, the Department of
Transportation day at the
legislature.
And I make it a point to
spend quite a bit of time,
you know, that day with Tanna,
the number one thing that comes
from the staff, there
is equipment,
you know, and I believe, you
know, because I have seen the
yards in different places
and it's a no fault to the
department. It's a no fault, the
fault is on us, you
know, for not supporting,
you know, the funding for that,
that would be at
least keep you going, you know,
to, to be
adequate. So
that's one part
of uh Mr Chairman of
the other part that I would like
to ask and I would like to
bring this year
is wherever
it lies. But
if it's an increase to
funding, uh we
really need to improve our
striping statewide.
And again, it's
more it's
needed, but it's also a
safety, a big safety
thing when you can't really
see the, the different parts
of, you know, the,
the miles that you're
traveling on highway or
other areas.
So thank you, Mr
Sherman. Thank
you.
>> The next step we have
uh Representative
Garcia followed by
Senator
uh Representative
Pettigrew.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman
Mr Secretary. You mentioned
you had 30 cattle gardens
that you were looking at.
Where are these cattle guards in mckinzie
County
or?
>> Yes, Mr Chairman Representative,
all, all 30 of them are in mckinley
County.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chairman
Mr Secretary. You know,
because there's a lot of cattle guards everywhere
that are, that need attention,
you know, and I don't want to be off
of uh the district.
But what are we gonna
do about those sand dunes on
371.
You know, I just got a call yesterday
from him again and I know
it's due to over
grazing probably
on, on the
Davo Nation
Line. But those
sand dunes I was up there two
weeks ago and they're right up to the
white line now
in the north. I know it an issue.
And how do
we plan on addressing
that,
>> Mr Chairman Representative? Thank
you for the question. Um
The really the only thing we can
do is just load it up
and haul it off. Um
We're finding it very
hard to
find locations that we can
continue to stockpile that material
because basically it's just waste
material. Um We
did, we did, I don't
know if it's getting lucky, but we did
utilize some of that material.
We hold it to the Santa Fe
penitentiary or the New Mexico
penitent in Santa Fe where
we were, you know, utilizing
that material for sandbags and it worked
out great for those. Um the
Herb Rz Canyon,
um you know, fire flooding
response. So it did work out well
in that case, but um
in most cases, it's just about,
you know, piling it up and piling
it up and that at some
point, um we're gonna have
to figure out what we're going to do with that
because we are, we
are taking on a lot of material that
is taking up a lot of room in our yards that
we cannot use. Um
And we only have to the rightway,
right. We, we really like to get involved
in the project and we've been talking
about what we're gonna do outside of
our rightway fence because all we're doing
is basically taking that material out to
the rightway fence and like
you mentioned, it doesn't take long for
it to come right back.
Um So there's, there's, there's,
we're working on a long term
fix. Um
But it is an issue,
Mr Chair representative.
>> Thank you for that Mr Chair.
You know, because right there in Grans a
couple of years ago
there was a big problem with the
sand dunes, not sand
blowing sand, there
was obstructing the
highway and at
one point there, we had, I
think 10 or 15 Samite
wreck at one time
and it was due to vege
vegetation overgrazing.
Maybe we could reach out to the Navajo
Nation and, and try to put a
stop to the overgrazing
on the that because
I know you cleaned it
out one time and then right back
again and it's, it's even
worse now, you know, but,
and I know it's not your problem.
It, it is your problem. It's
just an issue that we need to
resolve. Uh That's
all I have, Mr Chairman. Thank you, Mr
Secretary.
>> Thank you chairman.
Uh
Thank you secretary re
uh
oh,
where do I start?
The first question I
have
on
page
three and I and I'm
asking this question
for the people listening
and when we talk about the
laws of 2021 and we
talk about um
these projects will be
completed by end of
year.
Um One of the questions
that I received
was
is that the end of the fiscal
year or the end of
the calendar year?
And so just
for, for their edification, for
them to understand how you
guys look at stuff.
Can you provide that answer
please,
>> Mr Chairman
Representative?
Uh it's the end of our,
our fiscal year, which is June
30th.
>> Thank you very much, Chairman. Thank
you.
Um
So when we say
expires
2025 we're,
we're really saying June 30
2025.
Ok. So some
people from, from your district
were asking me that question. So I
thought I'd get
the that answer out there,
>> Mr Chairman and represent. That's a good
question because, you
know, a lot of times we receive
this money and we have, you know, three
years to spend it and
in almost every case, and you can
see here, we, we don't
ever take it that far because we need the
money right now. We need it down on the
pavements as soon as
we can get it down. So it doesn't take us very
long and I know we kind of mix
up fiscal years and construction
seasons a lot. Um
But this particular one is
by the fiscal
year.
>> Thank you. Um
Chairman, my next question.
Uh actually
I wanted to state something
about using duct tape to
hold equipment together. You know,
growing up on a farm and ranch,
we had a B and wire to help
us out. So I
understand where you guys are at.
And I think it's important that
we start having those conversations
about what our true
needs are
not just potential
for this
year and this year's
funding, but
you know where you're at
in, in year two
from now, year three
from now, because you already
know where you're at on
your, on your trucks and
stuff like that. But you also know where
your hours are at, on your
blades, on your
backhoes on everything
else that you have out there
and starting to put together
a predictive saying,
ok, you know,
30 day session,
2026 we
know we're probably gonna
be in
this, in this
area with respect to
equipment. Here's the current
value of that equipment,
you know, taking,
taking
and cost adjusting that
out for two years and
suggesting what that number may
be. So we can actually start
being a predictive.
And secretary Rick, we've
talked about that so many
times, we need to get to a point
where we're
predictive and we
already know what we're
looking at so that
we can codify
that and
get it to where
we don't have to have some of the
fights that we had this
last year where we walked in a
week before
session with a
big goose egg for
road funding.
And,
uh,
so I would, I would like to
continue to have those
conversations
and, and actually
dig into the weeds.
I understand when I was in House
Bill three, I'm pretty confident most
people don't.
And so when we,
when we look at, at
that
Mr Chair, this one's more for
the committee,
um,
we have a significant amount
of, of road issues
in the state of New
Mexico,
a significant amount
of accidents
death across
the state.
Today, we asked two district
engineers to take time
out of their district and come down
here and we give you both an
hour apiece.
That's what we think of
you
to be able to go through your details,
go through your issues and
everything else you get one
hour. That's
it all summer
long. We're gonna
give you one
hour.
I'm not saying that the stuff on the
rest of this agenda is not
important, but
we should be having a three hour
conversation with each
district going through
the details of where you're at
and why you ask is what it
is.
But we don't think highly
enough
of the work that you
do
to give you more than an
hour.
And I apologize for
that.
Thank you, Chairman
>> Mr Chairman and, and
representative, if I could just touch on the
fleet piece a little bit. So
all our equipment like you mentioned
is we captured in a off
the shelf system called fleet
focus. So we have the
ability to do exactly what you're
saying, put that number together for
you based on, um,
what we see as
the number of hours on heavy equipment
or the number of miles on
pickups and sedans, we have
that information built in.
But what I haven't done in the past
has brought that number to you because it's really
sticker shock. Right. It's way up
there. Um, if you look at
a, a snow truck right now routing
around $250,000
each, um, it kind of puts
that into perspective. So the need
is humongous. We'd love to have
that conversation with you. I
know Senator Gonz, this has been a,
you know, a proponent of this
project and, and continue
to try to fund us with equipment and
whenever you want to sit down and
talk equipment with us, we are definitely
up for it. Appreciate that
comment.
>> Thank you very much, Chairman. Thank
you very much
Mr Padilla for that
and I am gonna add one more
compliment. I appreciate the
effort that the, the,
the dot has
and the, the
work that you put into your
relationship with our heavy highway
contractors. And I'm
not just talking about the guys that
build the roads. I'm talking
about the people who put the safety equipment
out. I'm talking about the people that do the
striping. I'm talking about the people
that do the bridge railings
all the way down
four
statewide,
um, state
for companies
that reside in the
state of New Mexico. The
list is long and
the amount of work that we,
that, that y'all have
and the effort that y'all put into it
is great. And I really
wish you would go over to the
Department of Homeland Security and
teach them how to hire people inside
the state instead of hiring
out of state contractors
with all the pork that
we just threw into a feed
bill that shouldn't have gone into
a feed bill. Thank you
very much
>> if I can, Mr Chairman, just to piggyback
on the equipment. Going back
to Senator
Woods question earlier,
the uh the discussion
about capital outlay for
equipment really
just kind of tse off
the agency's need
for capital outlay.
We have the second largest
footprint of any
state agency in the state of New Mexico.
Second only to Corrections
department, right? 82
patrols, field
offices, your
project offices, you name
it not to mention our
districts and our go
and for years going
back. And this was a discussion that
started I think a year ago
is the Department of Transportation
manages 240
million of capital outlay that goes
to other agencies,
but we don't get any capital
outlay for our facilities.
And so as you visit
our patrols, like Senator Gonzalez
said, looking at the
equipment is
just the book cover. If
you walk into some of those
patrols, their need
for water infrastructure,
sewer infrastructure,
for barns, for H
VAC, for ventilation,
for um in, in the
shops, equipment
upgrades, you name it. So this
year for the third year
in a row, we submitted an
I I um and, and
this year we'll have our patrol
supervisors and, and some
of our men and women from the
patrols show
up to the Capitol Outlay Committee
to say, you know, we know
we drive by the municipal
yards, we drive by the county
yards and we see
what they have relative to
what we have and we have some patrols
that um that need a
lot of work. And so we're,
we requested $31
million for just building
upgrades across the state
and that doesn't even touch, touch
our equipment. Otherwise
we take that money
directly out of state road fund
just like we did for equipment this
year.
>> On that point, Mr Secretary,
do you have somebody that oversees
that other than,
you know, what, what you're
describing is true? You
know, you don't, you're judging the book
by its cover. Do
you have somebody an independent
or somebody that goes
in and actually looks at this
stuff instead
of uh you know,
your patrol foreman or
whatever, you have somebody else who looks at
that stuff.
>> So Mr chair representative
at the agency, we do, we
have a statewide facilities
director and, and we just added
a staff beneath him.
We had an individual who was
liaison between the patrols
and us at, you know, at the district
office. And so we
thought it made sense since he was visiting
with all the patrols that he also
capture all the capital infrastructure
needs. And so
that's what we're doing. And then we've
used um some contractors
like year on energy to go and do
performance or, or contract
or I'm sorry, audits
of the infrastructure there. So
we have third party
independent and we have
internal um
eyes, essentially
inventorying all those capital
needs at our, at our
patrols.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair secretary.
Can you know that's important to have
somebody looking from
the outside in because
you know what, what happens
when you come in front of appropriation,
whatever and you have
employees from the State Highway
Department and they say, well, they just
want more money. But if you have
somebody else looking at the problem
that probably really helpful. Thank you,
Mr Chairman. Thank you,
Secretary
>> step with Representative
Kates, followed by Senator
Woods. >> Thank
you chair and, and thank you
very much for your presentation.
I do clearly
see the challenges
that um are going,
especially with the maintenance of the
facilities as well as
equipment. Um
I understand that you have your
own in-house statewide
facilities managers.
So, um,
have you ever
requested funding from
GS A for state
facilities uh
so that it is not coming
out of the road
budgets,
>> Mr Chair Representative.
So, um,
last year, we were hopeful
the GSD, I think it
was last year, the year before
GD, we had asked
for $10 million
in, in our I I
plan and
um, an appropriation and that amount went
to GSD and we thought,
hey, that's ours. It should have, it
was supposed to be ours. But, you
know, um because it
listed 10 million for statewide
facilities and it went to them
and, and we thought maybe it was
intended for us, but
the language didn't lend itself to
that. And so,
um we haven't received
capital support from GSD
directly um for,
for any of our facilities. And
so what we essentially
do is carve out every
year from our carryover
balance um
somewhere between five
and $12 million to
try and chip away at some of the projects
a lot of time. So
>> thank you, Mr, thank you for
your answer secretary.
So I would just say that,
you know, please reach out to the
legislature when it's time to
find the right language
because um I, I
believe that
uh that that
is the
appropriate,
at least one of the appropriate ways
of funding streams. I, I'm,
I'm asking a few questions just
for clarification. Sorry to keep
harping on this. But
let's go back to cattle guards.
It's mentioned three times
now, so far, this will be our
fourth.
So I have to
understand, are
they
the responsibility
of the personal
owner? Are they a
county responsibility
or are they dt's
responsibility? And I
understand that maybe
each one of them fall
under a separate
agreement.
Is that a
correct
assumption?
>> Uh Mr Chairman Representative,
um
depending on the cattle guard. Yes,
to all of your questions. They can be
owned by us by a
county, by municipality
or by a private property
owner. Essentially,
when you're coming off of the road
to create a driveway
and um that driveway
or a road off of
a state asset,
you got to get a permit, right? And
the minute you leave the road,
you become the
owner of
that driveway.
And so we have on that driveway,
you add a cattle
guard as representative
Allison stated by state
statute, you're responsible for
the maintenance of that driveway
and the cattle guard that sits
on it. Now,
in some cases where the cattle
guards may belong to a county
or municipality or
government subdivision or like
the Navajo nation, there's
opportunities for us to come
in and help because we have public
funding and a governmental
entity that needs public support
to get them cleaned.
The, the place that it
gets tricky is when
we can acknowledge that
the cattle guard is owned by a private
citizen, then the
state statute is clear there,
right? It's the
responsibility of the cattle guard
owner. And if it's a private
citizen using
federal funds to assist a
private property owner with
a statutory responsibility
becomes the sticking point. So
when we can come in and help
a local or a public
body with their cattle
guards,
that's a lot less sticky
than a private property owner.
>> Thank you, chair. So
let me just so I can clarify.
So if counties
or maybe even the
Navajo Nation had
an agreement
regarding
uh either a section
or grouping of
cattle guards of
maintenance that they understood
that they owned them and they had the
liability but
that they would contract
with dot For
maintenance. Then
it is not an anti
donation because now it's a
public safety that
it doesn't matter if
the private
person is maintaining them
or not, if it's connected to a
state road, it's a matter of
public safety. So then
that's when they would qualify
for support from dot
for those cattle guards. Is that
correct, >> Mr Chair
representative? That, that's correct. And
that's kind of like the
big picture for us with
all anti donation issues
when you start to really identify
the public benefit and the public
safety piece
because as
it turns out, if
that that
animal gets on the public
roads, then
surely they turn to the
public entities and not the private
property owner for
recouping any kind of loss or
damage or harm. So
we all essentially
deal with the
fallout when, when
the public, the
general public, the traveling public
gets or is hit
or, or hits an
animal on the roadway.
So we're coming in and saying,
how can to what extent can
we justify
public resources addressing
the issue? >> And thank
you. So sorry, I have two other
just clarifications as
well. So
also Representative
Allison mentioned
about the alligator cracking
between gallop and
Shiprock.
So we had learned in
this committee last
year that that
happens
usually to
roads that are carrying
very heavy
vehicles. We
learned that when we went to visit
Hobbs and Jaw
last year, um
is is that
the current belief that that
is usually where that comes
from,
>> Mr Chairman and
Representative,
not always, not
always the case. Um
in some locations in this particular
area, the the
foundation for which the road
was placed on is
not very good.
Um Usually we'll try
to treat some sub grades with
concrete or lime or whatever the case
to try to stabilize
the sub grade as much as we
can. But over time
that does fail
and ultimately, the road
will see some soft
spots. So it has a lot
to do with where it's located,
oxidation of the material, the sun
just beating the heck out of it,
drying it out and
uh overweight will crack this, the
pavement. Um It's
hard to say exactly what the
result is,
but it could,
>> it could be a fact and, and I
appreciate, I appreciate that
you have to weigh where
you're gonna put your
resources and based
on traffic and stuff.
But but I just wanted to
clarify. It also could happen
long term maintenance,
lack of maintenance on
it. I just one more
question just
to um connect
with Representative
Garcia here regarding
the debris that is
coming on the road and I know
that you keep moving. It,
it's not a,
it's not
compostable
materials.
Where do you put it?
You can't put it in your yards.
So have,
has dot Considered
some type
of and I haven't gone to
look at the site so I didn't even know this
but, and an engineered
project of
where you're grading so
that you have
a hill
before the road just
because this is a public
safety matter.
And we could talk about
overgrazing
and um
and moving
the materials all
we want. But
if, if it's
just we keep doing the same
thing and it's not
working.
Um Is it
on the, on the list,
the very long list we've
learned today of
projects that possibly
an an engineered
solution
to, to
forbid what is coming
out off of that um,
that area on to
the public roads.
>> Yes, Mr Chairman
and representative. That's a good, that's a good
point. Good question. Yeah. As a matter
of fact, that's exactly what we're trying to
do. It hasn't been
easy because um
some of the red tape
that the Nava Nation has to go
through in order to get things cleared and
moving is not the same as
this process that we do and
for the state. Um So
we are working on a long term
solution that was trying
to kind of what I was trying to get across.
We did a very similar project
on I 10 and in
Ain's area where we did stabilize
outside the writing fence with a,
with an engineered solution
and a lot of many people coming to the
table and agreeing that this is probably
the best thing for the area
and we did stabilize that we
did some vegetation
improvements and some other
engineered solutionss
that, that we feel
overall are working pretty well.
We do have the issues with the blowing
SAN anyway, but we've
put some, some safeguards
in place so that when it does happen,
this is what you do.
Um So that's,
that's kind of what I have I alluded
to and it, it's gonna,
it's, it is,
you know, uh gonna take a little
time, it's gonna take a little work, but we
are, we are definitely
going down that road.
>> Thank you so much, Mr Chen. Thank
you very much for your
answers.
>> Uh Representative,
um Yes, Senator
Woods has announced that
he's
got
not speak
again.
Thank you, Mr Wood.
So I just have a
couple of quick
comments,
you know. Uh I just like to
reinforce what Senator Gonzalez
said about the gas tax.
Hasn't gas tax hasn't been
increase since
1993 31
years ago.
And if you have factored in
inflation, the
gas tax would be
uh double, would be
36 cents instead
of 18 cents.
We're one of only, we
have the second or third lowest
gas tax
uh in, in the, in the
country
as
representative of
Pettigrew made a good point.
We, we're not spending much time.
We're only spending an hour
with the, these folks that are
spending billions of dollars a
year.
Um maybe not a
half a billion at least, or maybe
more.
Uh But that's a problem. We,
we have 23 members
on this committee as only 10 showed
up today.
So, but
it doesn't show much inches. Although
in all fairness, a lot of people have to
travel long
distances.
So we would be able to spend more
time and hold the administration
accountable. Uh
If we had more
staff and
longer sessions
and paid legislature
because a lot of people
have full-time jobs, they
can't, they can't
attend. So
Mr Pettigrew makes a good point.
We aren't spending enough time,
but that's for
reasons. I just pointed
out
and
because of representatives
pedigree comments,
we may have to have a working
lunch. So we're gonna give people
all the time they
need.
So
when you correct
me, if I'm wrong, I hear you. You have
15
last, in the most
recent budget is only $15
million allocated statewide
for equipment.
So you, you, you got
a list of 10 million.
So there's what, how many
districts? 67,
>> six. And if you include
Mr Chairman, it's six districts.
But if you include the Santa Fe
campus as well, we do have
equipment there as well. So >> if you
divide that equally, you only get two
or $3 million right,
>> Mr Chairman. That is >> exactly correct.
So when you talk to the
LFC, do you
use the argument that,
hey,
for new equipment that we're gonna
spend more money keeping
this equipment going than if
we had
purchase new.
Do you use that
argument?
It doesn't, you
do? And it doesn't work.
>> You know, we really
argue with LFC secretary.
Put that come in my, but it's true.
We rarely do. But
I, if I, if I could give you the
number on just the repairs that we make
alone is in the area of $3
million on equipment, repairs.
Um, so we spend a lot of money
on equipment, whether we're purchasing
it or keeping it up to,
up to speed. It's,
it's a, it's a,
it's a battle
>> and, well,
when I was a city manager, we
used to use that argument
and it worked quite often, but
I'm not saying,
and it's just a whole different
situation here
and often we even would
sometimes take,
we take the, we
would not take the lowest bid because
we could make the argument that
this couldn't
even, we're spending more money. We're gonna,
we're gonna spend less money on
maintenance.
So, um
>> that is true. That is a true
statement. You know, we have some
snowblowers
that uh could
be repaired by certain
companies because they
are, you know,
specialized pieces of equipment.
If you can imagine a snowblower, they come
from, you know, across the world.
Um So that, that
comment plays in.
>> Exactly.
Well, thank you. Thank you for
uh being
here and uh
thank you
here in Cha
Chava Vera for being
here. They have a lot of
responsibility,
a lot of employees
and, and the money
to oversee and to
supervise. So, thanks
for being here. We'll move on
next to uh
district
two
and we will welcome
Francisco
Sanchez who is the
district engineer
for District two.
Welcome.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman uh fellow
committee members, Francisco Sanchez.
I'm the District two engineer. It's a pleasure
to be here today uh to
speak about District two.
Um Overall,
we encompass
my district where
it encompasses Southeast New
Mexico. It's the
largest district by Landmass
and we have the most lane miles
of any other district uh very
diverse. You know, all the way
from the mountainous areas on the west
side, to the plains, to the east
side, down to the
Le Lee and Eddie County
area which the permanent bain
run runs into
uh within the district. There's 11
counties and I'll list
them out for you. We, we, we
represent Chavis Lincoln
Otero Eddie
Lee Roosevelt
Curry DEAC
and we do have a small
portions of very small parts of
Guadalupe, Torrance
and, and SIO
within these 11
counties. Uh
We, we
support 86
entities. This includes
32 municipalities,
32 school districts,
eight universities,
uh three military
bases and one tribal
nation. Our, our district
two commissioner is Gary
Toja.
Um And you
ask how we do this if you go to page
two, uh we do
this with
332 full-time
employees. Uh We
have of course
patrols and construction
offices spread throughout the,
throughout the district. This
includes 16
patrols, six
construction offices
and uh two special
crews. Uh On
top there on page two, that is our
operating budget
for roughly 45
million. This is our,
our, you know, includes our
payroll as
Rick Pia touched on
fixing equipment, keeping
our oper operations running.
Uh There's one number I'd like to
highlight on that. It's a
contract maintenance and I'll
touch later about
that number here later in the
presentation, but we
received annually
6.1 in contract
maintenance at the
district.
Um If you
go to page
three, this
is our, our kind of
our overview rundown of
the, of course the House Bill,
uh General Fund appropriations
we received beginning in
2019. Uh
as you, you can go through the page
done a lot of work with that
money. Uh Very grateful
to be receiving that money and
taking care of some really critical
needs in district two.
As you go through this
page, the the highlighted
ones, these are
the only two projects that
were in the step and we
actually went out and let them
uh focus structure
projects. The the rest
on on this page that
are in in white.
These are all done through our, our contract,
main maintenance
contractors. And
so everything you see on this page
has been expensed
except the one construction
project in Curry
County, the 2 1013
51 and we are at
50% of
percentage of completion right
now.
So we go to page four.
It's just a continuation. There's
the laws of 2022.
Of course, the
the the projects in the wide have all
been completed. That money
has been expensed. Uh We
have one remaining project in,
in uh for 2022.
Uh That is the 2,
1043
33. Uh
This is the city
of Jal, it's a urban
downtown project and
so those those funds
remained and we're gonna be
letting this project here in
October, hopefully
against construction
late winter
or for sure, spring
of next year. Uh a needed
project in that area.
Uh If you go down to the next
three kind of spreadsheets,
this is what we received this
year. Uh this year's
session. Uh The
first one is through House Bill
and, and those are the routes
that will be addressed with that
funding. Uh The majority
of those routes are in Roosevelt
County. And so
you have 267
Roosevelt, New Mexico 1,
14, New Mexico
two or three. Roosevelt County.
There is one in Chavez uh New
Mexico two. And
then we are using
some of that money from House Bill
to acquire right away for our
big project on
New Mexico 31.
Uh The middle spreadsheet,
that is our, our
two biggest priorities in
District two U S3
80 New Mexico
128. Uh
These are eligible for
the bonds that were
authorized. And
so I'll touch a little bit more
in detail on the next pages on,
on those two projects.
Uh The, the bottom spreadsheet
is our operation and
maintenance of funding
received for the legislature
and the projects will be going
utilizing on the
maintenance side contract. Maintenance
is a New Mexico 18
US 70 US
285.
So as I touched on the
two biggest priorities for district two
is uh U S3 80
New Mexico 128.
Uh The, the here on
page five, that is the U S3
80 corridor that
runs from Texas into
to Roso, New Mexico. It's, it's
a corridor that has heavy
use for
freight, um
tourism and we're
starting to see a little bit more oil
and gas activity on that
corridor. So I
want to highlight a couple of
things right now. We have
two phases, funded
uh phase one and phase
two. We'll be
letting the, the phase one
here uh later this
month, we should be in construction
this, this winter. Uh
Phase two is the
project that we'll be using
the authorized bonding funds
uh to take on.
And we plan on letting that on
June 2025.
Uh last month at
LFC. Uh
Representative Kathryn Brown
had an excellent question that
she had brought up. She,
she asked, Rossell has been
awarded a national event,
the Reno Air races
and they have also landed a huge
manufacturing contract
there in Rosell and revs been
asked an excellent question. What do
we need to do to fully
support these events
and, and
um and manufacture that's
coming to, to, to the
area. Uh
And my answer to that is
we need to figure out a way
to complete
corridors, full
corridors. So
the reality is here, we do have 70
million. We'll complete. Phase
one. Phase two.
Phase three is
not for another
four years. And
then phase 23
phase 45 and six
without any additional funding.
The reality is we're probably looking
10 or 15 years to complete that
corridor. Uh And
a couple of examples of where we see
this uh us,
54 corridor
in, in District two that
runs from uh uh the
Texas State Line Chaparral
all the way up uh
is a tremendous freight
corridor for us. We're down
the last phase of that is getting
completed right now between
Corona and Carazo Zzo.
We started that corridor 22
years ago. So it's
taking us 22 years to complete
one corridor. And
so really to really
have impact in this state,
we need to figure out
how to complete corridors
and, and that's be
my biggest as when I come,
let's, it will be
380 this next session.
And of course, if you go to the next
page, um
this is our, our top
priority, New Mexico
31 New
Mexico 128.
Uh This is a
major corridor for
economic uh
extractions, industries,
your pot, ash, mines, your oil and
gas. Um
This 128 probably has
the highest fatality rate
in the state of Mexico. So it
is also
heavily we're heavily concerned
about sa safety.
Uh The total of everything
you see here would be $450
million to complete
everything here. Uh That
is a large amount. Uh
what we're planning this year,
we're gonna use the 40 million
to, to address
what you see on 128
which would be the long section, that
red and that blue
portion, that's what we're planning
on using that money
for. Uh,
and uh, trying
to at least get a
priority segment done
to try to hand safe
safety. And hopefully
we can continue to
figure out how to fund
the, this full corridor because it's,
it's really, oh,
and uh jail, the
orange portion will be going to
construction. That was the one that
was part of the, of
the laws of
2022.
Ok. If you go to
page six,
this is our upcoming
maintenance and this is a combination
of, of
our, that 6.1
million I talked about and
then the legislative money will be
received uh this
year for fy
24. You know, our program's
gonna be close to $20
million. You know, we got 9 90
million,
450,000
of the last two years. We've done
30 million worth of
contract maintenance projects,
uh not
shown here, but I'll give you some data
that, that I look at to see,
you know, where we're going, where we need
to be uh
through our asset management
program. We really got a good handle
of our paving conditions,
we drive them every year, we monitor
them, see where we're at.
Uh you know, we began in
2019, our asset management
program and
2019, our
US routes. Our, our
good percentage of
good roads in District two was
40%.
Our, our fair percentage was
50%. That was a
2019.
Currently, we're
pretty flat. We're at,
the good is
47 and the fare is
50. We haven't seen much
change, but,
uh, and then
I'll go to our state routes. This is where
we see significant decline.
Uh, back in
2019, our good
was at 24% on
state roads. Now, district who at
14 and our fare
is at at was at
60 and
now we're at uh 74.
So we've seen deter in our state
roads. But the bigger
picture I was trying to get at, you
know, last two
years, we spent $30
million of that
6.1 prior to
2019. We really
did not receive any general
fund. And so
I went back from uh 2019
to 2009
and the budget was the
same, you know, that's 6.1
and actually 5.1 we got
a little raise, but
for 10 years,
we only received flat
56 million
trying to keep these payment ratings
where they are. And as you can
see spending the 30
million uh the
last two years uh is
really just keeping us
flat float.
So to see major improvement
on these payment conditions out
on our roads and we
would need to see
you put more projects
on the road to enhance our payment
conditions.
Uh page eight at the
top of this is just
an overview of our ongoing
construction projects.
Uh The
highlighted ones of our major
construction, you're looking at our 30
to 40 million jobs,
the ones that are full.
Reconstruction is really
doing major changes. Our program
right now is close to $280
million which
it's great. It's great to see
that much work done in, in you
in District
two. So that's
our ongoing
uh pretty
much all these projects are wrapping
up. And so this
list ongoing will come
down a little bit.
Uh The
22,
1021
61 62 63
that is the US 285
corridor and that's a major
corridor in District
two that runs from the Texas State
Line just outside of Carlsbad.
Those are getting completed, they're
all complete.
Uh And so
we're, we're grateful that that quarter
full quarter got done
and it's, it's made a major
difference already for safety.
So uh
continue on, on that page.
Uh It's just a summary of the
Transportation Project
Fund, a awardees
from our communities.
So that will be uh
remaining on page eight
is 2022.
And as you go to page nine,
we continue with 2020
23 and
2024.
And then of course, page
continues the, the
2024
love this program,
you know, when I worked uh
through the R RT P
OS. It really sit down
through the Council of Governments. It's,
it's, it's really changed these
communities. The, the
projects that we're putting out are,
are, are amazing and
they've really done
a great job of changing
their, their local, local infrastructure.
So that's kind of the list,
the summary from the last four
years.
Uh page
11. This is just
an overview of our four
year step. And
so as, as
you go to the far column,
I'd like to highlight, you know, four
years, we have
uh 220 million to work
with for our construction
program.
Uh I work
closely with our counterparts in
text dot District,
which is very similar to District
two in, in
nature, the oil and
gas, the number of lane
miles. Uh I
sat down with him last
week. We were in a meeting well, a couple
of months ago at a, at
a conference and
they highlighted their step for four
years and his four,
his fouryear step,
same scalar
routes in areas.
District 21.2
million $1.2
billion. That's their fouryear
step at the Odessa
district. So I just
kind of give you a comparison on,
on some of the challenges
that we have in district
two in all
districts.
Uh The following two
spreadsheets down there.
These are just our next
priorities, uh
unfunded priorities. But as
we work through our fouryear step,
these projects will enter that.
And uh right now, we're continue
to, to develop these
in engineering. So
when funding does become available,
they'll be ready to, to go.
So that's kind of overview
of our our future here at
District two
and um
to say thank you and I, I stand
for questions, Mr
Chair.
So,
>> mm
>> pun
thank you, Chairman.
Um,
the uh,
I appreciate the presentation.
Francisco. Always good
to see you. I'm
gonna reiterate some
conversations that we've had in the
past just to bring
them back. Top of my,
um,
Singer Road
and, uh, West
County Road.
Uh,
we're gonna have to stop the accidents
one way or another.
So
we need to, we, that's
been a conversation between you
and I for three years
now
and it's
continuing to get worse.
You know, I have videos
of
the company that's right across
the street that
has, has at least
four major
crashes where people went to
the hospital
on it and I'm not
talking and when I say a major
crash, I'm talking about people
driving 55 miles an hour
going 22 opposite
ways hitting each
other.
So we need to look at
that and
what the other issue
is on highway
eight and the Carlsbad
highway and lighting
that intersection as
well. And that's been an
ongoing topic for us for the
last couple of years as well.
I just need to keep those top of
mind and
figure a way to get those
done.
>> So, Mr Chair
Representative, those
are extremely, those are
tough intersections as you,
you've brought up to my attention. There's
been some major accidents there
at Sanger in, in West
County. As, as
you're aware, we've looked
at uh do we've got signal studies
trying to see if it was
warranted. The traffic
is very heavily on that
major road. The the
mayor Road is, is
the approaches aren't there.
But after watching the video,
observing traffic, it's very
difficult for people to
cross that road.
So, you know, we are re-evaluated
the study. I know the city of
Hobbs is also doing their own
internal study. So hopefully
the results will be different. But
we definitely need to look at
other intern safety
measures at that intersection,
whether it's um
bring in some additional lighting
or flashers or we
real we need to look at something
while we try to figure it out.
Um These, these
intersections that have minor traffic
are, are very tough to
get us to trigger
a signal and,
and that one's been difficult
to, to get it warranted, but
we'll continue looking at it
and, and we
are getting updated, crash data. I
know the city is providing that
and maybe that warrant will make,
will meet. And of course, safety
is number one, if that warrant
was able to meet, we, we
would definitely jump on that
signal. And
right now we do, we're about
to let the project
with uh New Mexico
at New Mexico at Carlsbad Highway,
that land will be coming up here in August.
So uh for
production August letting in
this fall, uh
there's some difficulty the intersection
as you're probably aware of with the
lighting agreement, but we're hoping
to resolve that so we can
keep that in the project if
we're not able to
resolve the lighting agreement.
Uh, we may have to look
at pulling the lighting out of that
project.
>> Thank you, Chairman Francisco
of the,
the, the lighting agreement
would be between the dot
and the county. >> Right,
Mr Representative. That's correct.
>> Ok. Let's
schedule a time
where there's a three way
phone call
and uh, I'll
put the people on the phone
from Lee County that need to be on
there. We need to figure something
out and I understand
where the issues
come with, with respect to
maintenance and having somebody
that can go and if
it's a solar powered
light or what it
is to have the skill
set and the capability
to, to maintain
those, I get that. But
let's talk all the
way through it and find a
solution
and, and
uh, there's power not too far
away so we could probably fix
some of that just right there.
But either way I'm not
gonna
uh labor that
I, I think we, I
just want to keep it, continue
to keep it top of mind
and, and
get those
22
key issues out there
and saying,
II, I don't even
know how we can consider a, a
minor traffic on
Sanger and West County Road
when you can't get across an
intersection, that's no longer minor
traffic.
>> Mr Chair
representative. I, I appreciate
the assistance and I will never forget the
parties involved. And hopefully we can resolve
that and,
and I struggle with that myself,
you know, because we have several intersections
like that where, you
know, you're observing it and, and
if you weren't in engineering,
you weren't going into the data, you'd be like
this intersection probably needs a
signal. But when you
dig down to our criteria is
it's just not triggering it
and it, it is difficult
sometimes when you see what's going
out there. So I appreciate >> that.
Thank you very much, Chairman. Thank you,
Francisco. Thank
you.
>> Thank you. Uh
Next up we have Senator Woods
followed by
Senator
one.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair
Francisco. Thank you very much
for coming today.
Um
And thank you for the work on
54.
As you know, I've got a lot more
54
and
it's not your problem, but it's
my problem. So
I, I get to talk to four on
that, but
uh I've got
her and I thank you for your work
in T on
that overpass. Have, have we kind
of got that
agreement made
as to what we're going to
do now. So, >> so
Mr Chair and Senator where
we're at right now with the Tex
Bridge, we're working with text dot
on. Of course, finalizing
the design, we went to
our last public meeting. As you're aware, we
changed the design from an
overpass to more of
a bypass with the bridge on our
side, uh
Public was pretty
much 90% before
it was a 5050.
And so work with techs.
Do we went with this option?
Seems like the public ha are really
happy with this direction we're
going where we're at right
now. Of course, techs do is
the, the primary
party designing
the, the improvements.
Uh We're partnering
up on a grant right now to try
to fund that project with text
dot BS
FF and
ourselves. And that's where
we're at right now. Submit over a grant
here in the upcoming round
that's coming up.
>> But we're, we're moving
forward. We're moving forward. >> Yes.
Correct. >> Ok.
I've got a,
a, a secondary
road that,
that is really getting in tough
shape. It's
highway 275
going north out of
Broadview.
Uh, it
is a,
like I say, it's a secondary
road but the
shoulders are cracking
off and it just keeps
getting
worse.
Uh, we have done
some mial work
on the edges
but, uh, I
would appreciate if you get the
Clovis patrol out there
and, and look at
that,
see, it's,
it has been very
dangerous in the past
and, and they,
people travel way too fast
on it as many
other places and, and we
just need to,
uh,
see if we can do anything.
I know that it's, it's
not one of your major roads
like we're talking about
down south,
but it is a road
that needs some stuff
done on it if we
can.
Uh And
the, and
the other thing I thank you for,
for going in and
looking at that,
that other road there in Curry
County that, that the
water erosions
uh just really
wrecking.
Uh And I know that
you've got plans on
that and there's a study being
done on that
and I appreciate that.
Uh
We,
we are mighty happy with
the rainwater,
but sometimes
it comes a little fast
and it erodes.
Uh And
I would like to, to
say one other thing, Mr Chair,
this is why I decided
not to, not to
talk a while
ago because
when we, uh when we
looked at the,
the flood control
mitigation there at
Columbus, we
found out that money actually
went to the border
authority
and it was a $9.5
million projects
that we uh funded
from the ARPA
funds.
So I
know you guys
aren't
directly involved in that
other than maybe some permitting
when it gets close to your stuff.
But, you know, it's,
it's another case where
we put money
out there to
do work
and it doesn't get done
for every
reason in the world.
And
it's a shame
when we do have money,
we've, we've
got
contractors very willing
to go to work and
we, we haven't,
it's not your problem,
but it is
a problem in the state.
Um, I was wondering,
I was sitting here and I was looking
at all these projects
and different
things. How hard
would it be to
include in one
of these lines?
Um, the contractor
that was doing the work or
whether he's doing
it in house,
would it be that hard
to
on all these pages
where we're talking these
different,
uh, uh, contracts
let and different things if
we could just put the
contractor's name in
there
also,
>> Mr Chairman and Senator,
that's something we can definitely add
to the, to the spreadsheet.
Um, we don't put in
contractor only because we don't
know if you all know exactly
what, what they
do,
whether they do paving work, signal
lighting.
>> So it's, it's
many
contractors on one
project is
what the problem is. >> Mr Chairman
is there. It could be
or if it's just
a one contractor that we're in
con because basically we'll show whoever
we're in contract with whoever
their subs are, we won't show you
just the contractor. Um,
we just didn't know if, if we
provided a contractor's name, if you
knew exactly what that would
tell you other than a
name
because my guess, Mr
Chairman and Senator, then we'd have to put
process in there too as well.
So that way, you know, that
this contractor is providing
this service or if it's
just a contractor after we
can certainly add that to
the
list.
>> Well, it's certainly,
uh,
I guess, I don't know what I'm asking
for.
So,
uh
I understand you may have
subs working in different things,
but uh many
times on those
projects, we'll see,
you know, this work is done
by Fisher
or whoever. And
I just thought if
we could put that
major contract
on, on these
major projects,
uh We have some
idea
of, of
who's doing the work in those
areas is,
is, was my thought
and it may not be the
the will of the committee. So
Mr Chair, I'll
leave that up to higher
powers than me.
Uh Thank you
Mr Chairman
and, and thank you guys
for coming today
and giving us a
presentation.
>> Well, thank you. Thank you, Senator. And
next step, we have
Senator
Eagles followed by
Representative Nystrom.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and thank you
Francisco and I
just wanted to clarify
something on page seven
on the upcoming maintenance
that was Sarah Woods was
referring to it does show Cutler
and Mountain State and those that
are on the maintenance schedule.
I also think it would be a really
good have that
if we are already in contract with
them. And I understand there's
times where we can't do
that.
Cutler, for instance,
where there in Lee County we're
selling the asphalt that's
beyond the scope. They're the
ones with contract. So we're
not needing to be a list on
there, but it's just
important for the overall
to know that it, whether
it's our
employees dot
Employees or if it's a
contract coming in. So I
like the idea, but I just want to
state that it's already somewhat
in the process on
page 17 or page
seven. Sorry. Um
I do want to go to
questions. So my
state rep asked that I would
talk to y'all. Uh Kathryn
Brown's not here because she's
getting over some COVID
issues.
But she had a question
for Francisco. It says
is that New Mexico dot
availing itself
of offered assistance from
Eddie County to help with work
on 2 85
31 and other
project transportation
projects in that area
and why or why not? And
I know the discussion we'd had
is the county believes
that they can come in to
some of our areas that we
need and take care
of it in a timely basis because they've
got staff and
capabilities and just
wondered if we've looked
at that how that's
working or what the
obstacles might
be.
>> Sure, uh Mr
Chairman and Senator,
um, that's something
certainly we can look into. I
think it's a definitely an
option. Um It
just depends on how these projects
unfold actually through the
step and actually get funded and go to
construction, whether we
have the resources to
um you know, manage those
projects. Um If
we feel like maybe our plate is too
full, but the project can go, we'd
certainly love to get in, into
an agreement with Eddie County to oversee
those projects. I don't think that would
be an issue. I know we've done
it in the past, not in
quite the same circumstances, but
very similar. So I think
it would work here. Um But we'd
love to leverage Eddie or Lee
Counties assistance on,
on some of these projects. I
think that'd be a great idea, good
collaboration.
Um You know, we look
forward to working with them if, if
it comes to that. >> Well, I
appreciate that and if you can keep us
up anything we can do to
help with that because there's,
they do have some expertise
that would be available to us.
The last thing
she had is uh
I say the last thing is
she's wanting to actually,
you guys probably don't get this
often. Uh She wanted
to thank you all for the wonderful work
being done on 285
from Malaga to the State
Line. Uh We've
heard a lot of compliments
there again, Francisco
and I were there early on with some
issues. Uh And I,
I always appreciate
his openness to
look at the issues. We
had a water issue,
waterline issue that we were able
to resolve. Malaga.
Water could not have resolved
it without y'all's
help. Too small of an
entity, too much money.
But I appreciate that because
their, their need was great.
But since the
project's been done, we've
had a lot of compliments on
the traffic control
and how it's passing through
that area uh because it's
a great job. Uh So
she want to make sure that
I uh
complimented you on that.
And then the thing is
it represent
Pettigrew brought this up earlier
on eight and
621 80.
Uh She's want to thank you for
the uh lighting
on 285
near Georges
relief route
and it goes back to the conversation
and, uh, Randy, we,
we've talked to Lee
County, Mike Gallagher
does not want
the option of caring for that
facility, uh Same
insection years ago,
but this year I gave
away money to Eddie
County for lighting on
the grow money
because Eddie County will take
the responsibility because
they look at it as an option
of protecting life at
that location
and they evaluate it.
Uh But that is a conversation we
need to keep having in Lee County
because you've got two counties right there.
Back to back. One
looks at as an asset.
The other one looks at his
liability. We've just
got to change that
thought process, but
I did have sort of in
that same vein as
Chair Francisco.
So last year I gave that gross
money towards the
lighting in
county. Uh Is there
a place that you would prefer
thinking through your, your
vehicle list, your equipment list
on the grow money being that it's
gonna be there for a while.
Uh Is that something you
would prefer in your
equipment money
or would you like specific
projects like we did
on the, the lighting
issue?
>> Mr Chair Senator?
It'd be nice to have a combination
of, of both if possible.
Uh You know, the, the what
we've seen, we've seen the value of
equipment, you know, over the years,
the additional funding has really
helped us enhance our maintenance
program, us being able
to take on some of these
jobs similar to the contract
maintenance. So, uh of
course,
identifying
there's so many needs in district
too. There's so many other routes
you that would also be beneficial
to, to receive
that money to put towards projects
as well. >> Mr Chair
and Francis Francisco.
Thank you for that. But I guess uh
before we get to session, if
you would give me a priority,
uh I, I won't put
the investment where it's
best suited for you. I don't
do your job, but
I'd like to make sure that we have
the opportunity to
fulfill whatever your
obligations are. The other thing
I was gonna ask and it goes back to
equipment. Mr Chair is,
uh, our state
equipment is it GP S.
Do we have access to
that
>> Mr Chair Senator?
Currently, it's not,
but we did have a recent
incident where we
lost a mower and deck
that got stolen from District two.
So we're starting at
District two to, to
put GPS so we could
better track for that
purposes and other purposes.
But currently, >> no,
I appreciate that. Uh, I've
got a, an ipad
that tracks all of our equipment,
but even having GPS
this year, we've had a skid
steer stolen from a school
site. And we
also had a water
truck stolen from
Eunice where I live
on a Sunday morning, taken
out to an oil field job
or oilfield building,
ripped the doors off the
building. They loaded my
truck twice
and they put my truck in
the same exact place
they got it from. So they did
two halls from
having, uh, electrical
cable hanging on the water
pickets and they made
two trips out there. They put
it back. The good
thing is they added cameras.
So they took really good
fingerprints off my
equipment. They had them on the
windows, they have steering wheels, the
handles going in. So
if those guys ever get
in trouble, they weren't on
database. But if
they ever do that will
be trackable back to them.
Last thing I'll tell you is that
on our gps,
uh, the
skids,
uh, they cut
the GPS
out. I personally
think it's inside jobs on
my ex employees
because they knew where to go to cut it
out. But they at least gave
me my GPS
back because it
laid there on the side of the road.
We went to pick up skids here
and we found a GPS tracker.
So, uh, but I appreciate
that. I just wanted to make sure that
we're looking at that because there's a
lot, our
proximity to another
country makes it
really easy to get to somewhere
else that won't matter
where it came from. So, but I
appreciate all that. Just want
to extend
talking to,
uh Kathryn
Brown. The thank you. My last
question is on
the uh, highway
82 through Lovington.
Are we, do we have a completion
date on that? And how far behind
we
are,
>> Mr Chair
Senator. Uh,
you, can you repeat that
was the levy project,
correct?
>> 82. >> I, I
would have to go back to the updated
schedule and get you an accurate date,
but I can do that as soon as
this meeting is over and
I'll get you the anticipated
uh completion date for
that. >> Ok. Well, I
appreciate it. We do, we
don't get that many rain days
compared to what I think they're charging
us. Uh but just
uh it'd be good to just keep
um understanding where the
project is for me.
So thank you. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
Next up, we have >> a representative
in this >> room.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. I, I did
have a couple of questions.
The first was um
can you provide
if, if you know a
little update on this
Brian? Well, project,
I know we had taken a
percentage of
money, gas tax
that was going to go to the road fund
to help finish that
project because
it was on a state road. I remember
that project was a lot of
debate at the time.
Is that, did that get done?
Whatever happened on
that?
>> Mr Chairman represent
the Brian we mitigation
project to stabilize that area is
complete and done?
>> Ok. Do you know how much
Mr Chairman do you know how much
money was actually
diverted from the road fund
for that
project?
>> Mr Chairman and representative,
I think that number was 30
million. If I can remember
correctly. It's been a few years but I
can get you that number, but it was up
there. >> I was
just curious, Mr Chairman
because
I know that I had a
lot of concerns when that
happened only because
I know that we, that
road fund at that time was
pretty skimpy and
that we needed it for a lot of
other things that were road
projects.
But I am glad to hear that it did
get done. And
more importantly is that
the percentage then
now
you're getting going
into the road fund comes
from, is it the motor
vehicle excise tax or where are
you getting that funding
from
>> Mr Chairman and represent?
That's correct. That's one of the sources.
>> Ok. So you guys are getting
that now and that's
not going all to general fund
anymore? No.
Ok. Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
I,
I'm sorry, Mr Chairman, I forgot
one thing if I may,
I, I agree with
Senator Woods
on, um,
having the public have
access to those contractors
who has, you know,
the contracts for these various
projects. I, I heard
what he and Senator
Gallego said. I, I agree
with it. I even
think it needs to happen down
to the sublevel
like striping and things
like that. Thank
you,
>> Senator Gonzalez.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Just
a couple of short questions.
So what is your
vacancy
rate,
>> Mr Chairman, Senator,
our vacancy rate currently is
at 11.4%
at district
two.
>> Thank you. Um, the other
question that I was gonna ask
is, uh,
are you faring well
with the
CDL
as far as uh
has that been
uh working?
Ok. Or is there a
need to
work more on
that?
>> So, Mr Chairman
Senator, that is always a
need, you know, we're always
looking for CD L, the whole area
is looking for CD L. Uh
that is a great need
for Southeast New Mexico.
Definitely, the CD L
is a big part of
what we do. Of course,
you know, it is a requirement for
us that we do have training,
internal training, but it
is a big
need.
>> Ok. Thank
you, Mr Chairman. Thank
you.
>> Anyone else with any lastminute
questions hearing? None.
I
I concludes
our
discussion on the district
to thank you again for being
here. Appreciate your
time and effort and um
good luck going
forward. Thank
you.
Uh
We're about, we're right on schedule.
So we will take a few minutes
to approve the June
the minutes
of the June 18th
meeting. >> So
will Mr Chairman?
>> Ok. We have a first and a
second
and
um
we should have a show of hands
or prove the
minutes
minutes are approved.
Thank you.
So, since we were on
time, I
guess we'll be able to vote almost
an hour for lunch. We'll be
back here at one
o'clock to resume our meeting.
Thank you.
Ok. Are you
right
there?
>> Let's go get
