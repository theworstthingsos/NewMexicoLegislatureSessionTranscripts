And what amount share right.
The.
Good morning.
The.
Sorry
representative.
With their.
I think the microphones are.
I have with me this morning.
It's strictly for the
operational expenses to conduct
the business of the twenty
twenty four regular session
personal services employer
contributions mileage per damn
remembers in bill and st.
For your reference to the
appropriat.
Regular sessions.
The major areas increased
expenses for house session
budget our salaries and we are.
And
it's been in contact with the
minority and the majority and my
my chief of staff.
To address the need for better
compensation for our analysts
and to allow.
For years of experience.
Yeah.
The in twenty twenty three the
leadership budgets were included
were increased ten percent in
for twenty twenty four there was
agreement to increase.
So we also have an increased
cost of products and services
and as we have all experienced
in our data to lives the cost of
many products have increased in
price post pandemic.
Attend to the we have replaced
the copier in the clerk.
And it's over eleven years.
Seriously
printers are expensive and they
do wear out so the areas of cost
savings and generally speaking
they achieve clerks office
continues to be mindful of
unnecessarily sessi.
Or reducing whenever.
And i.
Read to you this morning I want
to.
The.
I I do have two quick questions.
I mean the personal servi.
The third line item.
Fifty two fourteen hundred
workers can't premium its been
in the.
Twenty one.
I will do my best but I believe
um that unnecessarily a role be
willed and to the sorry madame
chair representative I
apologize.
I will do my best to answer it
but I believe councils are
risking answer it better than I
can that figure is what gsd
along with like the unemployment
compensation and employee
liability gsd works out how
much.
Each agencies required to pay um
and i'm not sure exactly how the
mechanism is but I would as I
would guess that the reason is
so low is
is the post pandemic kind of
reflections since a lot of
people weren't actually at work
there were less injuries less
liability are those kind of
insurers sorry nervous
those kind of issues didn't
occur quite as frequently so
that's would be the reason why
our liability has gone down on
that and if row would like to
time and on that or necessarily
or if i'm fine.
That is that is correct.
Other question is from the other
category the second line item.
Board.
I guess i'm just trying to
understand.
Madame chair represented harper
yes I can do that so that first
line item that says
wars and commission that twelve
thousand that we're looking at
is actually mileage that one
round trip mileage for every
single one of you to come to the
santa fe for the capital
and then the second one that's
taxable that is your predium for
the session and those rates for
mileage and also the predium are
driven by the federal government
on what we're allowed to pay
for.
That's helpful so we refer to it
as.
And in my madam chair
representative harper is long as
i've been in this role that's
how they've always classified
it.
The.
Umm I believe the mileage rate.
I'm madam chair.
Is sixty seven cents a mile and
your per dm is a hundred and
ninety one dollars.
Thank you to.
