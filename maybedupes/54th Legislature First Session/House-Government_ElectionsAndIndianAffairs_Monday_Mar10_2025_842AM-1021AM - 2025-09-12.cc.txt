Hello.
12.
Yeah. So you can take
them off
now?
>> Ok. All right. I
just wanted to make
sure
test
past.
Ok.
Tell
it.
Good morning, everyone.
Let's go ahead and call
house government elections
and Indian Affairs Committee
meeting to order.
Please call
roll
and we have a couple of
folks, uh repre madam
floor leader is on the way.
Representative Anya Nou
is on the way, everyone's on
the way.
>> No representative
block president, Representative
Borrego, present
representative Lujan
representative
Miia
Madam floor leader,
Representative Zamora madam,
vice chair madam
chair madam chair. We
have a quorum. >> Thank
you with
that. We have a couple
of housekeeping
announcements.
We are
going, we were asked
by the sponsor to
roll House
Bill
513
until further
notice
and
possibly
uh House Bill
497.
Ok. With that, Representative
Matthews, we
have um
uh a simple committee
substitute
>> if you madam chair. Um
and uh I think
everyone knows Clay
Bailey, uh the
head of regulation and
licensing and he's been a key
person in trying to
move this issue
forward.
Um
This is a memorial
relating to uh mo
mobile home parks.
Uh There's been a lot of
difficulty with
frequent rent increases
with the utilities
that aren't being provided. This is from
the standpoint of the tenants
um and
other kinds of issues
and, and uh
one of the most
interesting things about the
industry is
that uh
regulation and lic
is in charge of the
manufacture of overseeing
the manufacture of the homes and
the installation of the homes
in the parks. After that,
there is essentially no
state oversight
uh overview. There
isn't, it's not clear
who you go to if there's a
problem. Uh
It's just kind of this
open
area uh
without any
clear lines of authority.
And so
what the memorial does
is uh ask a
group of very
state
um
state folks along
with a
um
uh and
headed by
and this, this uh
working group that we're
trying to put together would be headed
by um
Superintendent Bailey.
And um
the concept is, and
we had on page,
let's see, page
mm uh
two is
starting down in about
line 22.
We talk about what
this working group would be
doing and
um one
is just looking at a regulatory
framework, you know
what we, what
should be done
uh after installation of
homes in a park in order to
deal with issues that come
up. Secondly,
um
rent increases which
right now under the
mobile home Act,
um
there's only a
requirement that there be a 60
day notice of
a rent increase. And
what's happening is
that in many parks,
people are being
told two or three
times a year
that there's an increase
in their mobile home
rent and, and
it's not the rent of the mobile home
because they own their home.
Uh But it's the rent of the
space that the that is
sitting on and
that's creating a lot
of problems for the
tenants.
Um
It to move
these homes
out would cost
somewhere in the range of 10,000
to $20,000.
So, um it's
just a, it's a real
problem where people can
lose literally
their life savings, which many
of them put into their,
to their homes.
Uh because
we don't have a better
system for
um being sure
that that people aren't
constantly facing
rent increases.
So, um
so the second, the
second uh
recommendation, a area
we've asked for recommendations
is um
to look at what we
ought to do with the, with the rent
increases.
And here we tried
to use a balanced approach,
taking into account
relevant resident
circumstances, rates
of inflation pay,
raise a return to landlords
while Maina maintaining
parks in safe condition
and making necessary improvements.
We understand there has to
be some balance
in this process.
Um
But we, we need to work
on it and then, then finally,
in the, the, one of the things we added
to this version
um
is C on page
three lines, three and
four. We
added a catch all other
issues affecting mobile home
parks as determined
by the workgroup because of
course, once you start to
get into something,
you, you can
find that there's, there's
additional things that you
want to be sure that you have the
authority to talk about.
Um The
other change from the
one we had,
uh, initially,
uh, down
in,
at line 19,
uh, we set some reporting
dates
and we realized
that the reporting dates that we
had in the original,
uh, memorial were
too short. So
we've asked that
their first report come to
us by December 1
2025
and then a second report
by September 1
2026.
We time those
first, um,
before the
next 30 day session and
then before the next
60 day session
so that we could look
at whether or not additional
legislation was needed.
And
um with
that, um,
stand for
questions.
>> Ok. Um
Superintendent, would you
like to provide any
comments?
>> Um Madam chair members
of the committee, I appreciate
the opportunity to be here. I think I
talked about it a little bit the last
time. Uh I believe there's
everybody knows who've been
contacted or the challenges that
are coming with these mobile home parks.
I mean, representative block in
his area, we had some
real issues. Uh people
think mobile home and they look
at MH D manufactured
Housing division and think that's it. It's
not, we're just regulatory on
installation.
Um I don't know where this should
be housed ultimately, but I told
the Representative Matthews, I think it's
enough of an issue, enough of a
problem. I'd be willing
to sit down and try to run a group and
bring them from all sides, from landlords,
tenants. Uh
GS everybody and try
to figure out what is the real problem
because sometimes these folks,
they're on the elderly side,
a lot of times they're the
retirees, but
some of these issues, it's taken
weeks and months to
address and get corrected.
Uh, we get calls constantly,
whether it's not just rent increase,
it's, you know, having water supply, having
gas supply, even
down to their swimming pool sometimes.
I mean, we get a little bit of everything
so more than willing. I
think it's a right step in the right
way to set down and say,
I mean, back in the 18 hundreds, a
handshake meant something. Nowadays,
sometimes you have to regulate it because it
doesn't mean that anymore. It's
frustrating for me anyway, that's
the where it should have been. But,
uh anyway, with that,
you know, I'll stand for any questions
or represents you have. Thank
you. >> Thank
you. Let's go
ahead and go to the
audience. Um
Do we have any,
uh, comments
and
support?
Do we have any opposition?
Let's go
online.
>> Anyone hoping to make public comment
in support of the bill, please
raise your
hand.
Ok. Seeing none.
Um, anyone hoping to make
public comment in opposition to the
bill, please raise your
hand.
>> I see none.
Uh, do we have a
motion to move the
committee? Substitute for
discussion? Ok.
All right. Let's, uh, committee
members,
discussion on the committee
substitute,
represent a
breco.
>> Thank you madam chair and
thank you, Representative
Matthews for bringing this
forward. Um
When I worked at the city, we
did have an issue with
this uh at the Delray
Mobile Home Park. And I sent you
the article I
actually uh
had to work with
the community
um
to there was
a move
to move out the mo the
residents of
that mobile home park
and they did in fact, move them
out. And the problem
madam chair and representative
was when
um the
developer went to pay those
individuals
and move out their,
their mobile
homes, many of their
mobile homes were very
old
and they could not be
moved
because they were
so old.
And um
unfortunately, they
only offered them the
value of that
mobile home
at the time
and the the value
was very much
decreased over
time and some of them had
been living there for 20
or 30 years.
And um
you know, they did, we
did sort of
negotiate madam chair
um as the city
when I say we, I mean, the
city negotiated
uh to, to
have the developer offer
them a
um
because they were gonna build uh
condominiums and,
and town, you know, town
homes and
apartments to
offer them the opportunity
to move
into.
Um these
this new ar this
new residential
development, it was a multifamily
development. It
was unfortunate because
it really wasn't at all
the value that they
were used to of
living in a single family
mobile home.
Um So I really
admire you for bringing this
forward. I know that a
lot of these are located
in your district
and being able
to either buy
a home or
even move into
one of those
units
really did not compensate
at all or.
So my experience
just wanted to share that with the
group because
um it was really an
unfortunate sit situation
and there was not a lot we
could do at the time. So
I, I appreciate this and I
really look forward to
what, you know what you
all come up with. I'd
like to offer you guys
any assistance that I
can um
from my experience. Thank
you, madam chair and thank you,
Representative Matthews and
your
guests,
>> Morra kind of a
due
pass.
So it's a do not
pass on House
Memorial
Committee, substitute for House
Memorial
35.
So we all
right. Do we have any opposition
to the due pass motion in a
second? Seeing
none. You have a due
pass.
Thank you. Thank you.
Have a, have
a great
day.
Hey leader
Armstrong is here,
House Bill
65.
Welcome back.
Mm. Ranking
member
Blo,
>> good morning madam, chair members of the
committee. Thank you for having
us this morning.
Um This is House
Bill 65.
This is relating to public
schools clarifying that
local school boards and
governing bodies of charter
schools shall determine
the total number of instructional
days per year
and the number of instructional
days per week
that students are required to be
in school programs
and this is declaring an
emergency. And with me,
madam, chair and
um committee, I have stan
rounds and he would like
to say a few >> words.
Thank you madam, chair members of the committee.
Good morning. They'll get to
see you very often. So it's good to
be here. I'm Stan
Rounds. I'm the executive director
for the New Mexico School
Superintendents
Association and also
the New Mexico Coalition
of education leaders.
Since you're not normally hearing from
me, let me kind of give you the scope of
that. I represent
230,000
students in New Mexico to about
1000 administrators,
all 89
superintendents. And in
this matter, madam uh madam
chair in this matter, uh
also the charter
schools in New Mexico because
several of them were in a
lawsuit. And let me
please just give that
background. Uh
You as a legislature
two years ago,
decided that Children needed
to go to school more
hours in a year.
And he passed a law that said there would
be 1140
hours of a of
a of instruction a year
for students
that raised it from 1000
80 for high
school students and
raised it from 990
for elementary
students.
You did not. And
and years before that, in
fact, you had looked at whether or
not it should include something
about days, it did
not
madam chair the districts
in New Mexico prepared
their uh their
budgets accordingly.
But the governor of the state decided
that there would be a rule that would
then also
superimpose
180 days
and five day
weeks on
all districts in New
Mexico. So we
took that to district court
madam chair and the Superintendent
Association did
because we felt like that the
legislative directive
was very clear,
that was the amount of instructional
hours this retained
about 32
districts who are on four
day weeks. As an example,
who primarily
are smaller
and rural districts in New
Mexico. It
also though preserved the rights
of districts around
the state. Even
with that, we're doing
um five day
weeks that are doing
it perhaps for 100 and
74 days is all
year rather than 100
and 80.
So madam chair, we prevailed
in district Court.
We received notice last
Wednesday that the governor's
office or the Secretary
of Education is now
appealing that we
will be filing a process in the
court of appeals, the
court order.
However, uh
sustains the
1140 hours
and in fact, does
what this bill hopes
to clarify. Madam
chair members of the committee.
This clarifies that the
governing body
of the local district
that being the school board
or for a charter,
their governing
body are the ones
who would prescribe the numbers
of days
meeting your law
of 1140
hours. So madam chair, this
is a clarification this
as statutory
specific to
protect those rights
madam chair. I'll be happy to answer any
questions.
>> We stand for questions, madam chair.
>> Thank you. Let's go to the audience.
Those in support. Please raise
your hands.
Ok,
thank
you
>> madam, chair, members of the committee. My name
is John Dirch. I'm with the American Federation
of Teachers, New Mexico. We
have about 30 districts
of educators that we represent
across New Mexico, including some
that are on a four day
school week. And, and this bill is
really important to them, the
lawsuit that
Mr Rounds referred to,
we signed on with an amicus
brief on that effort and
it looks like we're going back to court.
Um So we'll see, we'll
join you again there. But
um we really believe in local control
and we believe that when
districts follow the laws that were
set by the statute
um by this
legislature that shouldn't
have any interference from,
from the administration through
rule making. And so we did support
130 when it went through this
legislator uh
two years ago. And
so we do support household
65 and urge your support as
well. Thank you.
>> Do any others? Ok.
Let's go online. Do
we have any comments and
support
>> anyone hoping to make public comment and
support? Please raise your
hand,
seeing none uh anyone
hoping to make public comment in opposition
to the bill. Please raise your
hand.
>> Let's go back to the audience for
any opposing comments.
Seeing none
committee members,
me
vice your little.
>> Thank you madam chair.
Thank you so much for bringing this
forward. I
am having
attended our public
schools many years
ago. Um
uh We
uh in the central
corridor of the Rio Grande.
I went to Bernel public
schools and
madam chair,
what I found there at
that time
um before there was a lot
of understanding about the
cultural uh
traditions that go on
in our communities.
And um
this, it was
the time frame for the
class in classroom
uh days was strictly
adhered to and it
affected us because
um students were
counted absence
and absent.
And as we know now,
our cultural
um
um
traditions, thank you
very much
is uh our cultural
traditions are very much a
part of who we are
and it enhances
what we learn in
the classrooms. And
so we bring all of that with
us. And so what
I've noticed now, what I've
seen now, so
um we, when our
communities and I'm
only speaking at the p about
the pueblo that I know
is that madam chair
is that uh when it was
determined that it was important
enough for us, the
entire village, the entire
community to be there.
Um We were,
we were the expectation
was we were going to be there and
present.
And so over the
years, again, there were marks
counted against us over the
years. However, now that
there's the,
the
um recognition
of the importance of
maintaining cultural traditions
is now incorporated. And
so the calendar
has been moved around to
accommodate that, but it's not
just accommodating the pueblo
studentss, it's
accommodate it, it's a uh
applied
to students across
the board. So they have
a spring break now
that's been moved to accommodate
them. And I'm
familiar with farming
as well in our communities
way back when there were times
when harvesting was taking
place. So
I, I can
I support the
idea of the local
bodies determining
as you know, that they're
maintaining the required number
of hours but not so
much uh
determining how they're
gonna work that day into
their region,
their community and so on.
So I appreciate
um you
uh bringing this bill
forward my question
then was, and you just,
I heard it.
Thank you madam chair.
Was that um this
would codify that
which had been
uh
uh what is being challenged now?
Is that, that was correct,
>> madam chair representative. That, that's
correct. This would codify in
law what
the legislature meant
the whole time and
ultimately codifying it in
law or local control,
local decision
making.
>> Thank you, madam chair.
I'll listen to hear if there's any
other issues that I may not
have considered as I
was reading this. And
uh thank you madam
chair >> representative
Zamora madam chair.
I move a due
pass
represent a Borrego
before we take the
>> vote. Thank you
madam chair and, and thank
you um madam Flora
leader and your guest.
Um So
um two
questions. One
is our
private schools
regulated, I
mean, or the number of
hours of
instruction.
>> So madam chair represent
breo uh
private
schools
that are not accredited
by the state of New
Mexico are not
affected by either the
hours nor
this particular
law. >> Ok.
So those that are accredited
madam chair and madam
floor leader are
affected by
this
>> madam chair
representative.
They are as
far as licenser, but they are
not as far as calendar
because they're not
state
funded private
funds. Like I'm sorry, I
misled you. They, but it's a
two part question. >> I see.
Ok. Thank you and
madam chair and, and
madam floor leader.
My second question is why
are we declaring this an
emergency?
>> We're declaring an emergency,
madam chair and representatives
because of what's been
tried to be had
in the past, done by
rule. So we
are declaring an emergency that
this be on the books
um as soon as possible.
>> Ok. And
madam chair, technically
school districts begin their
budgeting
in April of
this year and we want
to be very clear that they have the
options on those
calendars. It
requires that emergency.
>> Ok. All right. Thank
you. Thank you madam
chair.
>> Do we have a motion
for a due pass by
Representative Zamora?
I'll go ahead and second
that do we have any
opposition
seeing none. You have a due
pass. Thank
you.
Ok, I
see. Representative
Dow
you
rise and
s
>> mhm.
Thank you madam, chair and members of the
committee. Um What
you have before you today
is an
effort.
Uh This is brought
by chief story from
the Las Cruces Police Department.
But also an issue that those
of us in the rural areas here
repeatedly
um state police
because they're part of the state
budget are paid
significantly higher
than county and local
affi uh, law enforcement.
The small municipalities
communities, villages,
they're responsible for funding
their law enforcement because they don't
have a lot of discretionary
funding their law
enforcement. Of what I've heard
that the average law enforcement officer at
the city and county level
makes as much as $25
less an hour coming right out of
academy. So we are
trying to find a way to sort of late
level playing field a little
bit, um, started
with the tax credit and
the tax credit needed to be applied
across the board for all law
enforcement. So the, the point,
the point is to try to,
to give an advantage to the counties
and cities and we looked
at a property tax, uh,
exemption, but that,
that puts an undue burden on the
cities and counties. We've got a lot of those
floating around and every time we exempt
a property, the counties and
cities revenue go
down. And so what
we did was come
up with a fund and
what this fund does is
loan forgiveness for city
and county law enforcement
officers as they serve
in those hard to
place rural
areas. And
that's pretty much what it does. So
I stand for
>> questions.
Thank you representative.
Let's go to the audience
for uh comments
and support. Please
raise your hands
in opposition.
Let's go
online.
>> Anyone hoping to make a public comment
in opposition and in support of the
bill? Uh please raise
your hand.
Ok. Uh See none.
Anyone hoping to make public comment
in opposition to the bill, please
raise your
hand.
>> Ok, committee
members,
Representative Zamora
madam >> chair, I do >> pass
second
and was
here.
>> Thank you madam chair. Uh
I was just
wondering uh uh
why the
state police were not
included and that I
heard your response.
Um Do
they otherwise my
question is madam chair, do they
otherwise
have access
to other
scholarships or loan
repayment programs?
Are you aware? Thank
you >> madam
chair and representative I'm
not aware and it
wasn't to exclude state
police. We're trying to find an
equalization so
that the smaller communities and
villages can, can
recruit and
retain.
>> Thank you very much. That's
my only
question.
>> Representative, a
Borrego.
>> Thank you madam chair.
Um uh madam
Flo leader.
Um
I don't, I don't see that you have
a expert witness but maybe
the answer to this on
the, on this
sheet, which is the
fir in
in the back, it says
that um
state state
police officers would be
ineligible to receive
loan payment under the provisions
of HB
304. And
then it says
current as the bill
is currently written, it could
face legal possible
legal challenges.
And then it goes on to talk about
the Equal Protection clause
of the 14th amendment and
so on and so forth. I'm
just wondering what your thoughts are
regarding that. >> Yes,
madam chair and representative,
this is actually the language
that is, it does comply with
the Equalization Act and
it, and we are allowed to do this. This is a
scholarship and we set
up scholarship funds for all
different reasons and all different
types of people. Um
So there, there's,
this is why it's a
scholarship and
it's a loan and it's loan
forgiveness and, and
the language is modeled after
other scholarship
funds that we have set up.
And so it would require that
if an appropriation is
put into this fund, then
the higher education department
would be responsible for,
for awarding the scholarships.
If the fund's empty, there's nothing to give
away. Um
but um
it's, it's modeled after other ones
when we pick and choose who
are eligible for scholarships based
on need, based on
highman jobs. And
that's, that's how I'm seeing. This
one is a highman job
that's very difficult to
fill. >> Ok,
thank you, madam.
Sure.
>> End of Luhan,
>> they just a
technical
um
and I'm just double checking
here. So it's making an appropriation but
there's not an appropriation in the
bill. So, are you gonna
remedy that madam chair?
Um >> Well, madam chair and
representative at in this
language, we don't do that
because the part about making the
appropriation
is, is on page
seven on line
seven. well starts
on line six. The fund shall be
administered by the department which in this
case is the higher education department
and the money in the fund
is appropriated to the
department to make awards pursuant
to the, to the fund. So
this, there's no appropriation, it's
making the fund, but this is the model
language.
It's who will make the
appropriation at a time. It's one
>> made. Thank you. I, I unders
understood.
So
that
the way I see that, so this would
be um an
appropriation
as a recurring
appropriation through the
budget of corrections.
Is that correct? Madam chair,
>> madam, chair and representative.
It's a corrections.
It's just, it's, it's a fund,
it has no dollars,
but if dollars are appropriated
to it in the future,
then higher education
department would be tasked with making
the appropriations at that time.
Ok, madam chair. So you don't, you
don't believe you need to remove
that language.
Madam chair and representative, I am not
a lawyer but it this is
we explained the intent to legislative
Council services. It's been reviewed and
I think the language isn't,
isn't calling for appropriation.
If you see there's no money mount,
it's clarifying that
if there is money in the
fund, that higher education
department will be the ones to transfer
it. Understood madam
chair. I just,
yeah, it's just a technical issue.
It's been brought up. I'm bringing it up
again because I feel when you have in
the title making an appropriation,
there should be an appropriation in
the bill. But if you're explaining
it that way, I'll go with that. Thank
you. Not sure if I
guess we'll find out at appropriations,
but there's, there's no money
in the budget for this. It's creating the
fund.
>> Madam
Likanski,
>> madam chair representative.
Do, would you?
I think the the
14th
amendment issue is brought up because
state police are excluded.
Can you talk about why
state police are not
eligible
for this? I know that they have
recruitment issues as
well. >> Madam
chair and representative because the
state police are oper are
a state fund and they
fall under state
authority, the funds
when they go to the academy, the state pays
for it. Taxpayers already pay for it because we
put it in the budget.
This is looking at that
gap for local communities
in whether it's their pay their
benefits, their scholarships, their cost.
Good academy that's already covered
for state police. So
what we're trying to do is find a
way to help local
municipalities
be able to recruit and
retain.
>> Thank you madam chair. But this
excuse me loan repayment
program is
for, is it for the
individual law enforcement
officers,
college
loans basically or
is it for the
academy?
I think madam >> chair
and representative it is
for the individual law
enforcement officers and it's to
serve in hard to place
areas, the rule
and the the the areas
where they're, they're already at a
disadvantage, significant
advantage on pay
and depending on what's going
on at the local municipality,
it's pretty significant.
And so this this is
to offset
to try to try to help them be
placed just like we do for rural health care
providers, just like we
do for social workers. I mean, we
have a, we do hard placement,
we do um it's
not equal across the board for
all educators, you don't get
the same hard to place or
housing assistance in the, in
the in the metropolitan areas that
we give in tribal areas
or other underserved
areas.
>> Thank you madam chair and
representative. And then
how
does this work with the
federal
program?
And do you know, or do we have
any law
enforcement officers that are
accessing that federal
program?
>> Madam chair and representative.
I don't know. Um I
was this, this was brought
to us from municipal
law enforcement that are having a hard time
with placement and I don't, I
did not ask them to come today.
I'm sure they'd be here and would answer those
questions. Um,
but I, I'm sure
they're not excluded from anything that any
other, any
other employee would be eligible
for. I don't know of
a federal loan forgiveness
program for law
enforcement
>> madam chair, uh
Representative
Dow, I, I
was just curious about it because
um there is a public
service loan forgiveness
program that, that law
enforcement officers
are eligible for.
Uh I do not know
whether local versus state
police. I don't know, I don't
know if there's any difference there in
eligibility, but ok,
thank
you.
>> Ok, before
I um ask
for, um, before
we take role or
proceed with our motion, I
just want to thank you for bringing this
bill forward. So
I represent how
five gallop and
we lose a lot of our
city police and
our counties
to the state
because we don't provide
enough
is a
incentives. So I
just thank you for bringing this bill
forward with that. We have a
motion for ad passed by
Representative Zamora
and a second
by
uh represent a block.
And do we have any
opposition?
Ok. That's
um I don't
see any opposition. You
have to do pass and
um represent a bargo to
explain your vote. Thank
you madam, chair and madam
um floor leader. I would
like to ask if
before you go to the next
committee, if you have
an estimate of the
appropriation that might be
involved in this, because
I think at some point,
there would have to be
an appropriation
and at least if
there was some sort of a ballpark
figure. Um
you know, that would, I think that would be
helpful. So
thank you for that madam chair.
>> Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you,
Committee
>> House
Bill
87. Sorry
ho to
you.
Welcome. And you may
begin.
>> Good morning madam,
chair members of the committee.
Um I'm here to
present, we are here to
present House Bill
487
and that is um
in relation to
the Hispanic Education
Act. I'd
like to introduce my
expert witnesses and
then provide a brief
summary of the
bill. Um
We have with us, Deputy
and Castillo who's the
Deputy of Student Support
Services at the PE
D and
Doctor Julia Rosa Emsley,
who is the Hispanic
Education liaison
and we may be joined in a moment
by Representative Roy Boca
Valero, who's one of the cos
sponsors of the bill.
Um Another cosponsor that
we have is
um
Mmh Tanya Miam
Moya
and she is out
today. Um
So I will try to relay
her, her
comments as
well.
Um Welcome.
Thank you for joining
us.
The Hispanic Education Act
was first passed in 2010
and this is the first time
that um we actually
amend Bill.
And what we are asking
to include is something that's already
in the constitution, but
not in the bill. And
that is to include the
protection and
preservation of New
Mexico's Spanish language,
in particular, the heritage
language and
culture and
other elements
um of
the Education Act
include um
providing per diem
for our
advisory council because
we're the only act
that does not have per
diem for the advisory
council members. And so they pay
out of their pocket to
attend meetings across the
state.
Um We are also
incorporating
um biannual
uh Hispanic Education
Summits.
And
um
basically
that is
um what
what?
Oh yes. And we are
changing some of
the language
um removing
the words achievement
gap and looking instead
at lifelong success,
um achievement gap is
something that drove
this bill back in
2010. And
we don't use that terminology
anymore. It's a very deficit
based terminology. So
we're changing that
language as
well.
Um One thing that
was very important to
representative uh Mirabal
Moya is
that in the past when
she's brought up issues
related to how we
can support this bill.
Um What she hears back is
that uh Spanish
language and culture
are not written into
the bill. And
so um
this is uh something
that she's wanting to do because
for her, um she
sees a great need
across the state for us
to look at the
um
education
of the largest
group of students.
Uh Hispanic students are about
60%
and um
are the majority
population. And
so it's important that we
look at the education
provided to our students.
Um
I am
going to
ask my
um co presenters if
there's anything that they'd like
to add. And then we stand for
questions,
>> madam, chair members of the
committee. And um
thank you,
Representative Torres
Velazquez. Uh I would
like to just mention one
point and that
is that um
with this
house Bill 47
we wanna state
strongly that it supports
the whole intent of the Martinez
Yazzie lawsuit
and really
in stress
the point of
they stressed in
the court order
that we had to be held
constitutionally
sufficient, provide
constitutionally
sufficient and adequate
education across the
board for our
English learners, our Native
American students,
students with disabilities
and students from low income
families. Those were the
specifics and
that's what makes this bill
um so very important
for us and from
our um
advocacy and
perspective. Thank you madam
chair and thank you members of
the
committee.
>> Let's go to the,
do we have any, uh,
anyone in the audience who'd
like to provide a comment
and support?
Ok, please stand
and we'll do one
minute uh,
comments.
I, I stand in
support of this bill. I think
it'll move, help, move us closer
to compliance with Martinez
Yazzie
sergeant.
>> Um, my name is
Daniel Antonio
Herrera. I'm the
former president of the La
Merc de Manzano land
Grant. Um,
And I'm also a 30 year
veteran
teacher.
Um but I'd
really like to support
this mainly
because I was the first
co-chair of the
advisory committee
and I'm really
ashamed of how much we
haven't done.
So I'd like to,
to be able to help
all of you on this
issue. Thank
you.
>> OK, let's stay with the audience.
Do we have any uh comments
in opposition?
And none will go
online.
>> So for comments and support, we
have Eliza,
Eliza Liza. Can you hear
us?
>> I can? Good
morning madam,
chair members of the
committee.
As you can tell I'm at the
school. Uh My name
is ELISA Beria and I
serve as the superintendent of
Lake Arthur Municipal
Schools. I am also
a member of the Hispanic Education
Advisory Council
and a mother of two young Hispanic
bilingual ladies, I'm
here today in strong
support of House Bill
487
which takes an
important,
>> he is so sorry. We had to mute you
there. They were getting a little loud.
Um
we will
try that again. Hi, Alisa. Sorry,
can you hear us?
>> Can, can you hear
me? >> We
can, sorry. It's just, it's very
loud in here. We're gonna try
to figure this
out,
hearing aids. Sorry about that.
That was a, an interesting
technical difficulties here. All
right, Alisa, we're gonna try
that one more time. Can you hear
us?
>> Ok. Is this better?
>> Yeah, that's great. ELISA. Go
ahead. >> Ok.
Um I'm ELISA
Varia. I serve as the superintendent
of Lake Arthur Municipal
Schools. Uh Good morning
madam, chair and members of
the committee. Um
I'm also a member of the Hispanic
Education Advisory
Council and I
am here today in a strong
support of House Bill
487.
This bill not only
enhances the Hispanic
Education Act by
ensuring the preservation
of our Spanish heritage,
language and cultural
identity, but also
ensures the Hispanic
Education advisory council
members receive
mileage and per diem
since we are the only education
advisory group in the
state that does
not as one
of the 23 members of this
council. I can attest that
we dedicate our time and
expertise to
improving educational outcomes
for Hispanic students
without the same support
as other advisory
groups providing
basic compensation for our
work, not only ensures
fairness but also builds
a network of advocates
who can expand and enhance
programs statewide.
This bill is an
investment in our students
and the future of New
Mexico.
I urge you to support
a House Bill 48
7 to preserve our
heritage and create lasting
opportunities for Hispanic
students. Thank you so
much. >> Thank you so
much, Alissa.
Right. We also have here
a future focused
education. Hi. Can you hear
us?
>> Yes, I can. Can you hear
me?
Can you hear me? >> Uh
Sorry about that. Um
Looks like we're having trouble
hearing you. We're gonna have to move
on to the next person.
Uh Lawrence, Lawrence
Royal. Can you hear
us?
>> Good morning.
Good morning. Can you hear me? All
>> right.
We're having a hard time
hearing you as well. One
second.
>> Good morning.
>> Right. Good morning. We
can hear you doctor Roy.
Can you hear us? >> Yes.
Good morning. Good
morning. Good morning,
madam, chair and
members of the committee
I'm representing in
Laa, New Mexico.
We were founded 25
years ago by the WK Kellogg
Foundation to
increase access and success in
education.
We were at the New Mexico State
Capitol 15
years ago. To support the
Hispanic Education Act.
I'd like to thank uh
Representative
Roybal Caballero
and Representative
Torres Velazquez for
their leadership to advance this
bill. I'd also like
to thank the leadership
of the New Mexico Public Education
Department and the
co-chair of the Hispanic Education
Advisory Council.
Doctor Gomez Chavis and
Doctor Amador for their
leadership. I served
for over a decade
on the Hispanic Education
Advisory Council.
This is a, a very
important initiative
and I stand with my colleagues
to support the advancement
of this important bill
to further
uh move the Hispanic
Education Act forward. I
thank uh madam
chair and the members of the committee
for your time and energy
today.
>> Thank you so much, Doctor
Roo.
See, we also have
here, Mandi
Torres, Mandi Torres
here. >> I can
hear you. Can you hear
me?
>> Hello? Hi. Sorry. It looks
like we're having a hard time hearing you.
I'm gonna go ahead and mute
you and then go ahead and try to
unmute yourself and we'll try that one more
time.
>> Can you hear me? >> We
can hear you now. Go ahead.
>> Good morning madam, chair
members of the committee. My name is Mandy
Torres Education Reform Director
for Think New Mexico and the 2020
New Mexico Teacher of the year.
Today, I am here in support of
487 as a member of the
Hispanic Education Advisory
Council and as a concerned
parent, how you spend your
money is reflective of your
values. So the saying goes
yet, funding for our historic
Acts was zeroed out in two
out of three proposed budgets
prior to this session
despite unmet obligations
of the Martinez Yazzie ruling.
I am thankful to the bill's sponsors
for bringing this bill to protect
and preserve Hispanic
education. There
is a concept in education that should
be at the heart of all that schools
do cultural
responsiveness. Zetta
Hammond, one of the leading researchers
in this area says that culture
is how every brain makes sense
of the world. That is why
everyone, regardless of race
or ethnicity has a culture.
Hammond says to think of culture
as software for the brain's
hardware. In other
words, culture must be present
in our students learning experiences
every day if they are to
succeed. Yet many of our
students do not have the opportunity
to connect to their culture at school,
whether they due to a lack of culturally
relevant curriculum and learning
materials and absence of
classes to preserve our language
or a lack of enrichment
opportunities that help students
celebrate their identities.
Yet we know that cultural validation
and affirmation are a holistic
approach to learning and can
increase attendance rates.
That is this is why it is crucial
to protect and preserve the
Hispanic Education Act.
We must preserve a language.
>> Thank you so much, Mandya. We're going a little
over time here. Thank you so
much. And then we have just one more
here. We have uh we're gonna go
back to future focused
education. Can you hear
us?
>> Yes, I can hear you. Can you hear
me?
>> So we're having a hard time hearing you. I'm gonna try
this one more time. I'm gonna mute you. If
you wouldn't mind, unmuted yourself,
maybe that'll fix
it.
>> Can you hear
me?
>> No, unfortunately, we cannot
hear you. We can see the,
the audio is playing on the zoom, but we're
having a hard time hearing you here in the
room. So with
that
a ranking >> member
block,
>> thank you madam chair and uh
representatives. Good to see you.
So couple questions.
First of all, we're changing the
language. I heard you said
close achievement gap was
like, we don't really want to say
that everyone's in a gap, I I suppose,
but I don't know how we
ensure lifelong
success. Can you tell me
how we're defining that madam
chair
representatives?
>> Um Well, you're right.
No one can ensure
lifelong success.
Um But that is the aim, that's
part of the aim is
to support students
100% in
all areas of their
education
so that they can make the
choices they need to make in
order to determine what
career path they'd like to
take in order to
determine and identify
for themselves
what they love in terms
of what they want to learn, what they
want to study, how they want to
grow. And
one of the things that
I think we all know
is that education
is um
fundamental
to our
um well being as
much as um
I've heard from students as much
as water, air
and food. And
so, um we want
to ensure that we provide
solid education in
all aspects of their lives, in
particular
um academics
and the um
cultural language
support. And
no, and, and when I
say support, I'm, I'm gonna be
careful with that word
because we,
we see culture and language
as an asset, very
strong asset and, and
across the state, we
have um many
different kinds of
Spanish. Um in Northern
New Mexico, we
have recently seen
that the
um
heritage language is
disappearing as our
generations get older. And
we want to preserve that
language and culture
and we see that as
part of the lifelong
success as
well.
>> Thank you madam chair and representative. And
I, I certainly agree with you when it
comes to the heritage
Spanish language,
we, we are losing that and we
definitely want, want to keep
that. But I feel like
I hate to, to be
super broad when it comes to
ensuring lifelong success.
You know, it's, it's
very positive and I'm I'm a very
positive thinking kind of person,
but I I'll continue
on here. So madam chair representative,
we're also adding
the word commu the the
words community based on
page two after
community. Can you tell
me what that changes
in regard to the outcomes
that we're searching for? Madam?
Chair.
>> Absolutely.
Um The Hispanic
Education Act was created in
2010
by a group called the Latino
Education Task Force who was
working with many different
community organizations
in the
city of Albuquerque
and also across the
state. You hear
you heard Dr Roy Ball
talking about in Lase
LSA was very involved.
Other community organizations
were very involved. So not just one
community organization
but a lot of people participating
through forums, we had
forums on Black
Education Hispanic
Education Indian
Education and we
wanted to make sure
that all groups
felt heard. And
so part of that
push, a huge
piece of that push. I would say the
foundational piece of that for
push came from the
community. And
we want to make sure that they
are never left out. And
in fact, the it's the community
that has pushed it. Now, we have
continued to have forums.
Um Doctor
Emslie has continued to
have forums that
involve not only the
Hispanic Advisory
Council, Education Advisory
Council, but all
aspects of the community as
well.
>> Thank you, madam chair and Representative.
OK. And then I'm
continuing here on the on the
bill and I'm on page
three, it says at the
biannual Hispanic Education
Summit, is there currently a Hispanic
Education Summit.
Now madam
chair >> Dr
Emsley to address
that >> madam
chair Representative block.
So we have informal
summits that we've hosted.
This would just formalize that
it would happen two times a
year. And
currently the Hispanic
Education Advisory Council
is required by a lot of meet
twice a year. So
that could happen during these
summits
and not that you asked, but the
purpose of the summits would be
to um
produce com
uh advisements
for the Secretary
of Education with the
Voice of Community
built in
there.
>> Perfect. OK. Thank you madam
chair and representative. And then I am
just gonna go to the fir real
quick and I
see here that under the
current Hispanic Education
Act, we have a few programs and I have some
questions, Latinos
in action curriculum in eight
schools. I
was wondering which schools those are and
what, what that is if you might
be able to help me with that madam
chair
>> madam chair Representative block.
Thank you for the question.
We've got um I
can't recite the A I could
email you those if you'd like,
but we've got um schools
in Las Cruces, primarily charter
schools right now. Um
Pecos middle
schools on board. Um We've
got two schools in Albuquerque,
some in Las Cruces. And
then um we've got a middle
school in Roswell
who are um Latinos in
action schools. It's a progressive
leadership curriculum.
The kids take it as
a elective
and they learn all sorts of
things about civics, about
leadership, about being in
community fundraising,
um honing their own leadership
skills. The kids were actually here
on Friday for Bilingual Day
and they were guests in the
Senate.
>> OK. Thank you madam chair representative.
And then another question about
the fir it says 100 and
50 copies of the book Equity
In School Parent
Partnerships
was disseminated,
said about
$37.7000.
Can you tell me what, what that
book was? And how did
it go to the,
the ends that we're trying to get with
preserving New Mexico dialect,
Spanish, et cetera. How, how's
that help
>> madam Chair representative
block? So we've
hosted at the
um dual language
New Mexico State Conference,
this parent institute
where we've had over
100 parents both years
that attended. And
they were given this book
as like their curriculum for
the entire day. Plus
the follow-ups that they did
throughout the year.
The book focuses
on um the
expertise of parents
in their child's
experience at the school and the
important partnerships that can
go beyond parent
involvement and into parent
empowerment or family empowerment
and engagement
through all
different um
academic, academic
parent teacher teams
um partnering with the
principal around
um policies,
um understanding
budget,
all of those things that help
parents be better advocates
for their students, but also better
resources for
the schools at
large.
>> OK. Thank you, madam
chair.
Thank you madam chair representative. So
I guess my, my last question
is how are we going to ensure
in, in schools in New
Mexico that we are
preserving this native
or not native? But this uh
this historic
Spanish dialect? Because
when I went to high school in
New Mexico, Northern New
Mexico. We did
not learn that dialect. And
so I'm wondering how are we going
to, to ingrain that
back into the curriculum?
And how is this gonna help?
Because I, I have a hard
time when it comes to a lot of money that
we're gonna be put putting in, it looks like
100 and some 1000 over the
next few years.
And I just want to make sure that we are
indeed preserving that,
that old
dialect so that
we keep it in our state.
So can you tell me a little bit about that
representative experts,
anyone
>> they can start?
Um And then I imagine
my experts might have something
to add. Um
We will work closely
with a bilingual Multicultural
Education Act.
We will work with
communities, we
will right now,
we don't have funding
or too many projects.
Um This last year, I believe it
was 500,000
total and that includes
the salary of the staff
and the director and
no per diem.
Um But we are
looking for
to, to
increase funding next year and
in, in subsequent years,
to really
provide some activities
that engage the
community and the families
to begin with
in terms of
um
collecting and restoring
the language. We know
historically, there have been
researchers at UN M
who have collected samples
of the language, but what we
want to do is protect it and
continue its life.
And so we will have
activities, we will work with
dual language, New Mexico,
we will work with
um the Latino education
task boards, the community
groups, but we will
certainly work in the pe
D to
um in incorporate
any curriculum materials
that come from this. One
of the things that came out with
the Martinez lawsuit was
that there are no
curriculum materials. And
so just as you said, you're not
seeing it in the schools
because that material is not
there. And so we
have um, the, the
woman who spoke before,
Doctor George Royal is in
conversation with the
liaison, Doctor
Emsley. And they're
looking at ways to
collect data and
sorry to collect materials
that already exist.
Georgia Roy Ball had
created an incredible
curriculum with um
Lieutenant Governor Roberto
Mondragon and
it is archived at the University
of New Mexico. But
I think between
Doctor Emsley and
Georgia, they're gonna come up with
some new ideas on
materials that already
exist. And then
um in the
um gatherings
that happened with the summits that
will in this is a
major goal. And so it will
be, I'm sure it will
be um
something that is addressed
by the entire committee
and I don't think that any one
person has the
answer but
with community and the
pe G and
um the
schools and the
council I I
think and
the Hispanic Cultural
Center um
and the importance of this
to our Hispanic community,
I am certain that we
will come up with a plan
that given
adequate funding
would come
to fruition,
>> madam
madam
if I may just very quickly,
this is right up my
area of, of doctoral
studies and
um research
and one of the things that we found
very effective is
oral histories, testimonials,
what we call oral histories,
testimonials, which are
already uh
underway in
other parts of the country,
which is we should
be leading that. And
that's why we want to incorporate
as much as we can. Because
I think curriculum
madam chair curriculum
development, as
well as owning our own
publications, publishing
our own materials, I
think and
using the
oral history testimonial
approach
as well as
um developing
it because we have the expertise at the
universities
and um and
our community-based
efforts. And
then what's the beau
further beauty
is the fact that we have the Hispanic
Cultural Center which
we now align
with, for example, El
Paso just created
or um uh did a
ribbon cutting on their
own uh mexican-american
Cultural Center. They're calling it
the mexican-american Cultural
Center. So collaboration
with all those cultural centers.
Um I'm hoping that we
can uh publish
our own material
and begin to
incorporate that material
in K through 12 all
the way up. Thank you, madam
chair. >> Thank you madam
chair representative. And I hate to, I hate to keep
on belaboring this, this bill.
It's a very good bill and in
some ways, in some ways, I I find
some confusion.
So Hispanic
Education Advisory Council, can you just
tell me, is there anyone from U and
M or the universities who sit on
that council, madam chair
representative?
>> And I'll start and then
you can OK.
Um Madam
chair and members of the
committee and representative.
Um from the beginning,
it has been very important
to the secretaries who have
served and to the
liaison. And I was
one of the first
liaisons so
I can attest to this.
It has been very
important that we
have representation
of all kinds
across the state. And
so there is no focus
on one place
or one location in one
year, but rather a
focus in getting a broad
span across geographical
differences,
um career
and um
employment
differences,
um party
lines, many different
things that would
affect the diversity of this
council because as we know
Hispanic um
Hispanic population is
not one
and only we have a lot of
diversity in
our um popu
Hispanic population.
So um
over the years, there have
been committee
members from the
University of New Mexico
and from other universities
as well. And I'm going
to turn this to Doctor
Emsley so she can tell
us what is
current
>> madam chair representative
block. So the law
requires that we
look at all different occupations
and career strands
and geographic areas of the
state. Currently
the person that was um
from UN M on the advisory
retired in the middle of her
term. And now she's
at at a national level. It's
Doctor Gomez Chavez, but she
started while she was
um at UN M on the
advisory
council.
>> OK. Thank you madam chair representative. I
just, I just add that because I
think as Representative
Caballero said they're doing some good
work at the UN M level.
And I would love to see that actually
ingrained in here and I don't see
that. And then another thing is
I just, it was informed to
me that the Bilingual Education Act
doesn't really mention local
dialects much. And
so I guess I would just also want look at
that in the future. So I'll,
before I make a decision on this, I'll
continue to listen to the debate, but thank you so
much for your answers, representatives and
experts. Thank you madam chair >> and
madam chair. If I may add, I
have another bill that
has not
reached any committee yet.
Um That would also update
a little bit more on the
bilingual Multicultural Education
Act language
and there was something
else, but I will
come back to it. Thank you.
>> Thank you madam chair.
>> I chair
little
madam chair. I would like to move
a due
pass
ocean before we
call roll
call representative
Lujan and then Representative
Borrego.
>> I'm gonna just quickly, I just want to say
thank you for bringing this forward. We
did um
manage to get a
$500,000
into the HP two.
I think that was mentioned.
It was, it's not
enough. Um
What we were, what was
part of the crux of the issue
was it
that the
process of, of I
just wanted to mention this getting the
budget through and and that amount
was to get more alignment
and more in
depth. And that's what this
bill is doing. I want
to commend you all for doing this and bringing
this forward. Thank you >> madam
chair.
Thank you, Representative
Borrego. Thank you
madam chair and, and thank you
representatives and your
guests. Um I
just wanted to
mention that maybe
coordination with the
Hispanic Cultural
Center, um
Zacky Teto and some
of those folks would maybe
help the, the
funding
um go a little
further. I know
it's, it's always tough when
you know, to, to
fund these programs
and but
when there's that coordination,
it, it also
um and also I just wondered
uh madam chair and representative
about the um
Southwest Hispanic Research
Institute at U and M, is it
still available?
But I it used to be run
by Tobias Duran, but I
don't know if he's, I
think he's retired
since.
Is that, do you like
to
>> um Yeah, madam chair
and
joint research with
uh Chicano Chicano studies
department. >> OK. So
that would be great if we could
do some coordination with
them. Thank you madam
chair.
OK. We have a motion
for due pass by vice chair.
Little, we have a second by
Representative Anan Nono.
Do we have any
opposition?
Seeing none? You do
pass. Thank
you.
OK.
We see
de la
Cruz.
How about
Armstrong?
How about
Herrera?
Representative? You may begin.
Welcome.
>> Good morning madam chair. Good
morning members. I'm
joined this morning uh with
the CFO of Admiral
Beverage Corporation,
New Mexico, Mr Keith
Hartnett, he will
be my expert witness and will
help answer any questions that
the committee might have.
Madam chair. One might
start
house bill 443
amend sections of the Liquor Control
Act to allow
individuals at least 18
years old to deliver and
stock stock
package, alcoholic
beverages under specific
conditions. The bill
updates existing laws to
expand employment opportunities
for younger workers in
the alcohol distribution
and retail industries
while maintaining restrictions
on bartending and alcohol
sampling for those under
21
madam chair. The reason
that I particularly
support this bill is for that
very reason that I stated
just a second ago and
that it expands employment
opportunity and
also expands
the ability for
uh companies like Admiral
Beverage to be able to
find workers to
do the work,
delivering
alcohol to
stores and other
locations.
So with that madam chair,
I'm going to have my expert witness
uh read a statement if you
might
>> madam chair again. My name
is Keith Hartnett. Um
I'm here in representing this
particular bill, representing
five other distributors is just
not Admiral Beverage um
for the entire state of New
Mexico. Um
approximately four years ago, the
legislatures approved 18 year
olds with a commercial driver's
license to handle packaged
alcohol.
House bill 443
expands this to allow 18
year old merchandisers and
warehouse staff to handle
packaged alcohol.
And the keyword here is
packaged, it is not
single bottles,
cans.
Warehouse staff are the ones that
pick the product that goes to a
specific retailer
from the warehouse that they,
that they are located, which
is then loaded onto a semi
truck slash trailer.
The ce L driver
delivers the package product
to the retailer and is stored
in the back room of their
facility.
The merchandiser is then
responsible to move the
package product onto the
retailer's floor and
place the package product
onto the retailer
shelves.
The big element to this basically
for the state of New Mexico is
this bill will provide great job
opportunities for 18 year olds,
male and female
to earn excellent pay
benefits and the opportunity to
grow with their
companies.
>> That
thank you madam chair. Before we for
questions, I just want
to let the committee
know that
at present, an 18 year
old can drive
a semi truck
hither and yon about the
state delivering alcohol.
So if you have a commercial driver's
license, otherwise
known as CD L, you can
deliver alcohol anywhere in
the state. With that madam
chair we offer for buses.
>> Thank you. Let's go to the
audience. Those
who wish to make a statement
in support. Please raise
your hands.
Go right ahead. Please
stand
>> madam, chair, members of the committee.
Good morning, John Thompson. I registered
lobbyist for Admiral Beverage
Corporation, uh and
other alcoholic beverage
distributors, madam chair. We
view this bill as a modernization
of an antiquated statute and I would
give you an example. At 19 years
old, I can work in a
bar and bring you a cocktail
that is open, right?
This bill allows somebody to
get a box and put it on a
shelf in a sealed package
container. Uh and,
and the sponsor and the expert witness
said this is about jobs. I would
like to say that this is about
careers. These are
excellent jobs.
These companies
hire from within and promote
from within. Uh I
don't want to say exclusively,
but there's a high prevalence of
that again, a
careers based
initiative uh that
applies excellent
benefits, excellent wages.
And we would ask that you pass this legislation.
Thank you, madam
chair,
>> good morning madam chair
Scott Scanlan registered
lobbyist for Premie
distributing soon
to be known as Hensley
distributing.
Um uh
we support this
legislation um
as John
mentioned, uh a 19
year old conservator,
but this bill would
allow an 18 year
old to,
to stock uh
alcohol that's
wrapped in plastic
basically. So,
um we think this is
AAA good bill and,
and I, I do want to say
that um our
uh former CEO who
retired a couple of years
ago, uh, Mr
Bates, uh, started
out as a merchandiser,
became a driver
and worked his way
up the ranks and
became CEO.
So these are careers,
these aren't just jobs, these are
careers. And,
uh, we urge your support. Thank
you.
>> Thank you. Let's go
to, let's go online.
Have any comments and
support. We'll take the
two. All right, >> we have two
here. We have Henry Sanville,
Henry. Can you hear
us?
>> Yes. Yes, sir. Uh,
good morning madam,
chair and members of the
committee.
My name is Henry Sandoval and I'm the
executive director
of the New Mexico Grocers
Association.
Um I also
one time grew up in the beer
business and
start as a merchandiser and work
myself up. So
we're, this bill
supports tremendous
opportunity for
18 year olds and above
to make a career out of
it. This also
allows all of our liquor vendors
to provide um,
all the stores with
much better and more
accurate service. So
we ask you to support and
vote. Yes, on House Bill
443.
>> Thank you so much
Henry.
We also have Ronald Ronald
Brown. Can you hear us?
>> Yes, I can. Thank
you madam,
chair and committee. Uh
My name is Ron
Brown. >> We're not being able to hear
you. I'm gonna mute you real quick. If
you want to go ahead and unmute yourself,
hopefully that will fix
it,
>> madam, chair and
committee. Can you hear
me now?
Ok. I apologize about
that. My name is
Ron Brown. I'm with
latitudes in Rio
Rancho, New
Mexico.
We, we
desperately would like
to have this bill passed.
We have some 18 and
19 year olds working for
us on our merchandizing
stocking the shelves and receiving
product in the back
and yet they cannot handle
the alcohol. So I'll be short
because most everything has been
said. But we, we ask
that you please support this
bill.
>> Thank you so much, Ron.
Ok, we're gonna move on
now. If there's anyone who would like to
make public comment in opposition
to the bill, please go ahead and
raise your
hand.
Ok, see you
then. >> Ok, we'll go
back to the audience.
Is there anyone in the audience who'd
like to make a comment in
opposition?
Seeing none committee members
that have vice chair.
Little.
>> Thank you. Thank you madam
chair. Um
uh I had
the opportunity to visit a
distributing company
uh
uh this last
summer as part
of one of the committees at the interim
committees. And what I
observed there, madam chair
was um
some of the issues that they were
facing, uh, at the
time with and
uh, with being able
to find
drivers, certified CD
L licensed
drivers.
So, um,
understand
the, the
situation that's being faced.
And I also, uh
madam chair got to
get a glimpse into some
of the challenges that were being
faced um,
there. Um And
so I appreciate
this bill coming through.
I've got a couple of questions, madam
chair. Um
uh making
sure that I understand
uh that I'm clear I
could use some clarity.
So,
um
uh let's
see,
the um
18 year olds working
in establishments, mostly
restaurants. It sounds
like that's already
established in current law.
Is that correct? >> So
madam chair, a server
has to be 19
to be able to take the
drink from the bar
to the customer.
Uh So that's already in place,
but I will add
that. It's kind of ironic because you
can be a bus person,
bus boy, bus girl
and you can pick up
half
consume drinks and take
them to the back in the kitchen
and you could be 16
years old at that 15 years
old.
>> Thank you. And
um this
bill, if I understand
this correctly,
the
it is
to am I
understanding this correctly that
A CD L is
not going to be needed
for those that are gonna be
driving >> madam
chair, uh CD L
for certain size vehicles will
continue to be
needed depending on the weight
and length of the vehicle,
semi truck as an example
is a class A CD L.
And if you drive
a CD L, you can be 18 years old to
do that. You right
now can deliver
alcohol if you're 18 and
you have a CD L that's
already in place. But
this would expand it because not
every vehicle that is large
in capacity uh needs
a CD L. You can have a big box
truck, but it's not a CD
L. It can even have a double axle
or four wheels in the
back. It doesn't
require a CD L.
Those kind of vehicles would
then be allowed to transport
alcohol and not
require a CD L. So you would be
18 and not
need a CD L or a big
van as an
example,
>> madam. Sure. One of the things that I
did see was just
how
uh
these vehicles
and my question then will come from
this is I saw
the big
uh trucks
that were loaded with the
alcohol contents
uh um
that were gonna be driven
out of this
bay area
had been
weighed this
in this, the,
the product was in
sealed. I mean,
I don't know, I how
they get it apart. I have no
idea but it was
sealed. Nobody could touch
it. They were weighed.
So when they get to their
destination, they're
dropping them off. It seems that
there were little
opportunities
for
mm them to be tempered
with is, is what I
will say. So
these vehicles then I
saw that in the larger ones. Are
you madam chair?
My question is, are
the smaller vehicles
going to receive the
same type
of
um
are they going to, they're gonna go
through that same process even though
they're smaller, the the
size, the weight,
the the contents
being um
wrapped madam chair.
Thank you >> madam chair.
That is correct. They will still have the
same requirements for
packaging and transport. And
remember that even
within what you were
describing, uh madam
chair and
representative
each
box, each
item it
already is completely
sealed within the
sealed. So it's
not as if you have loose
cans and loose bottles.
Everything is completely
contained from, from
the its origin,
which is usually like at Admiral
Beverage, which was in my former County
Commission district to
a grocery store or a package
liquor or uh
all subir k convenience
store type
situation.
>> Thank you very much for the
answer. Thank you madam chair. I
have one more question and that
has to do with
um what are
now what is now
provided in the way
of education?
Um Aside from safety
but alcohol and
substance abuse uh
prevention
type. Um
Is there any that's
provided to younger
workers on,
on uh
to try to deter
them or making them aware
of, of what
it is that they're dealing
with and
the what
comes along if they
choose to imbibe, they're still
under 21.
Uh I'm I'm curious
madam chair representative.
Thank you. Thank >> you for that
question, madam chair. I
I'm not familiar with
that aspect. So if Mr Hartnett
has some information, he can
answer.
>> It's an madam
madam chair.
Um It's an excellent
question. Um It relates
with the employees and such,
most of our development
comes down to really
their expectations of what the job
requirements are
specifically with who
they are supervised for
what their pay is
really. Um and the the
evaluations, but it, but
it relates to really
alcoholism and things along
the lines. We do not have a, have
a system along those
lines.
>> Um Madam chair, um
representative
and uh expert.
I'm wondering if
you down the road
might want to consider something like
that. If you're having
18 year olds
that's three
years before they're legally of
age to imbibe
and to purchase. I mean, they're
exposed to it
uh quite more than
probably and a lot of other
young people are.
But yeah.
Um but
I'm just wondering if that might
be a uh consideration
to be made down the road.
Uh It seems to be
alcohol uh as we
know, alcoholism is a
big or, or
the impact
to New Mexicans
is a very
significant. So I'm
just wondering if
they know if
they are aware
uh and educated about
what their impact
might be. >> It's
madam chair. Um
It's an excellent question
specifically with our hr
department. We, our company is
over 2500
employees across
12 states.
Um, so that's something I will definitely
bring up. I think it's a good idea
per se. Um, but the
fact that with, with everything
being packaged and such
and in effect is that in effect that
they, they basically have a, a
job responsibility
and, and stealing is not one of
those by taking
product and
such.
>> Thank you very much. That's all my
questions. >> I have
Representative
Borrego.
Thank you madam chair. I'll make a motion
that we approve house Bill
443
2nd. Thank
you. We have a motion
for a due
pass by Representative
Brago, a second by
ranking member block. I
just have AAA quick
question.
So when
I was that young, very
young,
18 years old, maybe
17.
Um I worked
as a stocker
in a, in a store
and then I was promoted
to pricing and
then inventory
and then I was promoted to
cashier
and then uh
then I decided to go to
college. So
for a youth at
that age who
decides to take on this
um job, what
is the career
trajectory?
What can they do
beyond that and going
forward? Thank
you.
>> Thank you, madam. So I think that's an excellent
question. I'm gonna jump ahead
of my expert witness because he's
gonna describe that. But one
of the things I want the committee to hear
is that driver pay
is anywhere from
$52,000
52,006,
38 to 60,000.
That's pretty good pay for an 18
year old
Keith
>> madam chair.
Um, I'll give you a
little bit of a scenario of
really, what kind of rates are
merchandisers start at
$17.
Um, and after a period of
time, one year, two
years, they get up as much as
$21 an hour plus
benefits,
401k profit
sharing. Um,
our, our goal as a, as a
company and I guess I'll use this
as a phrase that probably brings
in perspective. But the
average number of years that
at employees that we have in place right
now have been with the company for
over 25 years.
So the trajectory on this
basically is a little bit about what their
skill sets are and what they like to
do. We like to train and develop
people specifically
to grow within the company.
You can start in a warehouse, you can
start as a merchandiser and
you hope to grow into sales and
from sales into management.
Um And then as, as uh
was brought up a little
earlier that in effect of
the fellow who, who
was the president of
Premie basically
became president of the company.
So that's really what our desire
is. Um It's kind of the
culture that we have.
It's a fun culture
and um you know, we want
every one of our employees to do it.
So they're evaluated every year
specifically on what on what
uh their skill sets are
what their, what their uh
goals are specifically
for us to try to be that because
that's the only way that we grow
and to
prosper.
>> Thank you. Thank you very much.
All right, we have a motion
for due pass on a second. Do we
have any opposition?
Seeing none? You have a
Dupa
>> madam, chair members,
>> madam chair. Thank you very
much.
>> It's my
kids.
>> Hey, let's move on
to house school.
412.
>> Uh Good morning madam chair
uh uh leader Gail
Armstrong asked me to present
this bill for her.
And it's a, it's,
it's a a
I think an important um
little bill. It just
allows for uh a
28 state
compact to
recognize paramedics
and emts if they
move from another state
to New Mexico that we would
recognize that. Oh,
their license
and uh my expert
here is Christina Fisher.
Uh She is uh
an analyst with
the Think New Mexico
and uh this bill is backed
by them and
um just a matter
of personal pride.
She was one of
the scholarships
in our first lel foundation
scholarship program
25 years
ago. I'm
aging both of us, but it's
been
a
>> thank you madam, chair members of the committee
just very briefly. Um The house
has passed, I believe five of these
compacts unanimously.
I think New Mexico has
been seeking to pass nine
interstate compacts for health care
workers. Um The
fundamental principle, uniting them
all is just we want to open
our doors to health care workers licensed
in other states. So essentially
saying um if you
hold a license in this case as
an EMT or paramedic in
another state, we'd like to
grant you a privilege to practice
in New Mexico. Essentially.
Um recognizing sort of reciprocity
of, of your um
license in that other state.
This is especially important for border
regions as the fir notes. So
if you're, you know, you have a
paramedic or an EMT
in El Paso, we would
want you to be able to practice easily in
Las Cruces. Likewise,
you know, Durango, Farmington,
etcetera, sort of in those border
regions. So um
as the representative said, the
small bill, but we think it's important
and will help make a difference in terms
of increasing our number
of Emts and paramedics.
And just a quick note, that's, that's
one of the health care worker um
professions where we have the biggest
shortage. Um We are
lacking about 4000
emts and so
if we can bring more in that are
licensed in other states, that's all to the
good. So, >> thank
you.
Thank you. Let's go to the
audience. Do we have anyone in the
audience who'd like to make a comment
and support
or opposition? Seeing?
None, let's go online.
>> Anyone hoping to make public comment,
please raise your hand.
So we have uh Adrian.
Adrian. Can you hear
us?
>> Yeah, good morning madam chair and
members of the committee,
Adrian Gomez from the Greater Albuquerque
Chamber of Commerce. And I'm here this
morning to show support for House Bill
414 12.
We all know that New Mexico is in a
health care crisis
by the state entering the emergency,
medical services, personnel
licenser Interstate
Compact. It will join 20 other
states participating in this
compact. The benefits
include ems personnel working
across state lines without
the need for multiple licenses.
This is especially important for
those border regions and emergency
operations. This is
a bill that would help fill the void in our
health care system. It's
a smart bill that opens up
avenues for New Mexico to stay
competitive. The chamber
ask for your support for this bill.
Thank you so much for your
time.
>> So much Adrian. Uh Is there
anyone hoping to make public comment
in opposition to the
bill?
Ok. Seeing
no.
>> Ok, Representative
Lujan
>> Madam chair.
Um
mm few
questions. I'd like to ask.
Um, one
being when
we open up all these compacts.
Um,
one, I think one of the questions we, we
need to really evaluate and
ask, what is the,
what is going to be the additional
cost? Uh, I understand
the need as being
a, a factor in that. But the cost
will they be, will these,
um,
new contractors if you won't
be travelers if you
will? And they won't
be so they would
be making more money than
um, those that live
as residents
in New Mexico
and here. >> So
madam chair representative, I, I think you're
asking um sort of like
traveling nurses that kind of
equivalent in the compact case,
it's really more about having them actually
be here with certain of
the compacts. They can do telehealth.
Obviously, this is not one of them can't
really telehealth uh
emergency medicine with the psychology
and counseling compacts. You could do
that. But in this case, they would
literally be wanting to be
licensed here sort of in New
Mexico. So, um
this would basically say, ok, you
have a license from Colorado.
We recognize that license. You're
welcome to practice here in New
Mexico as well under that
Colorado license essentially.
So they wouldn't necessarily
be traveling paid more.
It would just be saying like we
recognize that your license is equivalent
to our license
>> madam chair. And in that
equivalency, do
they still have to come into New
Mexico and take some kind of
test or so it's
just a transfer
of acceptance,
so >> manage your representative
exactly that. So the
compact set sort of baseline
standards that all states that participating
must sort of meet these to make sure that
we're at sort of a good level of
quality. Once you've done that,
then you would not have to take extra things.
That's kind of the idea is to, is to
facilitate that entry
>> madam chair. The other question I
have is as I'm looking at
the fir I don't see is
this this being a fiscal impact?
But there actually is,
wouldn't there be with
RLD and other
um maybe
counties those holding the license
and regulations aspect
of this manager?
>> So madam chair representative,
um the folks that wanna
practice can be charged
a fee. So states have the authority to
say if you want to come
because right now there's a licensing fee if
you want to come, have a privilege to
practice, um we can
charge you a fee and so it
can pay for itself essentially
when we're crunching the numbers. It's
about a third of an FTE
per compact that we're in at
RL D to oversee it.
And you can pay for that with the fees
charged to folks basically
as sort of a an
interstate license. >> Thank
you, Matt. Thank you for that answer.
Uh Yeah,
we are in a great need. So those
are some of the things I wanted to know
just because I know that
we've, we've created
situations where there is a
especially with around our nursing.
We have traveling nurses and
the effect of that is affecting
our communities and,
and actually outcomes. So, thank
you,
>> Representative Representative
Borrego. >> Thank you
madam chair and, and thank you
representative and your guest.
Um So most
of a lot of these
um
licenses have
renewals.
And so
let's say somebody from Texas
comes to New Mexico.
Do they have to go back to
Texas to be renewed or
do they get renewed
in state?
>> Thank you, madam chair representative.
So essentially the way this
compact works and the way most of them
work, they have sort of one home state
license. So let's say it's Texas.
So they would need to follow
all of the rules and regulations
for that license. So if it's a three year
renewal, they would need to do whatever they need
to do with that. Once they have
that, then they are good to get a privilege
to practice in any of the other compact
states. So they wouldn't have to do any
sort of renewal things with New Mexico.
They just keep their home state license
current and then they keep that privilege
to practice elsewhere.
>> And madam chair and
representative and
your guest um
who monitors
that.
>> So madam chair representative, there
is an interstate board.
So essentially each state in the
compact sends a representative
to that board. It is always
a person that is on the oversight
board for that profession in that
state. So for example, we have a
board that oversees emergency
medical personnel in our state.
One person from that board would go
up to the interstate board and that's who
oversees the compact rights
regulations to implement it
and make sure that that states are all
complying as they should.
>> Ok, thank you. And is
that manager
um your witness, is
that through the Department of Health
or who's that done through?
>> That is a great question madam chair,
representative. I think this 1 may be
through RLD. We have, we
have board, we have boards kind of all
over the place, but I believe this one
is under RLD and Representative
Lujan >> agrees. >> Ok. >> Thank
you so
much
>> committee members, ranking
member block madam chair. I move a due
pass
motion for a due pass
and a second. Do we have any
opposition
being? None, you have a due
pass.
Hey,
I
414,
you may begin.
Representative
House Bill
4414,
county sheriff. >> Thank
you. Thank you madam chair. I
actually um
I actually signed on to this bill
with Representative Dow and,
and Armstrong uh
because this, this
really affects rural
counties in our state. And
what happens is that they
have to when they
transport um
prisoners
uh for
uh you know,
across state lines
or, or you might have to transfer
them from, you know, I I
don't chama down
to uh Las Cruces.
Uh, the county has
to pick up that cost
and it's not a huge
amount but it's about a million
dollars that all these rural
counties when collectively
have to pay out. And
it, and it can take a real hit
to those small
sheriff, uh, county
governments. And,
um, and that's why we brought
this bill forward and I,
I have to say I was sitting in
my office listening to
this, Um and
I heard you say Herrera and I thought
it was like number four down
on the list and I jumped up and
I grabbed the wrong file when
I ran out. So I'm
just telling you, it's
not a complicated
bill. It does require an
appropriation. We'll see if we
can get that. Uh But
it's really to offset
the costs that
rural sheriff
counties pay
for, for prisoners
that the state police bring to them
and then they're responsible for the
transport. Oh, thank you so
much. Thank you
rep block
and I, I stand for questions.
Thank you. Thank
you everybody.
>> Hey, committee
members,
madam chair move do pass.
Second.
>> I have one question.
>> Oh, public c
uh
>> Oh, we did. Ok.
Thank you madam chair. Thank
you for presenting, being
willing to present the bill on her
behalf. Um
I just, I had a question.
I have my madam chair
about um
the rates
uh for per
DM as I was going
through this.
Uh
If you can tell me
uh tell us is
the rate for
transporting
prisoners, the, the
perm I get that
is that rate
uh for transporting
prisoners
a different from
those that are
serving
papers,
>> madam
chair representative
um vice chair.
That, that's actually the
local per diem rate that they have
to pay their officers to
transport people.
That's what that refers to.
>> Yes, ma'am. And I'm just
wondering, I'm curious
as to whether there is
a difference between
those officers
who might be serving,
uh, papers to
someone they're out for the day.
I get it always.
And, um,
and, and I understand that
right. And the,
that idea per diem for
them. But I'm wondering
because you're transporting
prisoners. I'm wondering
if there is a different rate
for that. >> Um,
and no, they,
they have the same, right. For example,
in my county in Rio Riba,
they have about,
they have about 34
sheriffs and
about, you know,
10 of them are on shift
any day and then another
10 are transporting
prisoners are going
to, or, or,
or in the courts, you
know, um,
um, um,
defending their, um,
arrests and,
um, and the others
are on leave. So,
really these small counties
because these jobs are
24 7, they
really have a hard time kind of
rotating the sheriffs. They have
keeping everybody on track,
but they're paid,
um, they're paid according to
what their salary schedule is
within that sheriff's department.
And, and that depends on
every every county
as a, a kind of a
standard rate.
>> Thank you. Ok.
Um, so it is a
standard rate for
everything. Ok.
Thank you, madam chair. My last
question is, um,
one of the questions
that had come up during the analysis
was on
the, um,
definition of guard. There
wasn't, uh, it's used
but it's not defined in there. And
I'm just wondering if that's going to be
addressed before it goes to
the next
committee.
Uh, the term
guard
is included in here
on
page,
uh, page
one line
19
and, uh,
um,
sheriff deputies and
maybe it is
perhaps a
guard is a guard.
But I'm just wondering if
that's
madam >> chair. Uh,
madam vice chair. We'll take care of that
before the next committee.
>> If it, if it's required
madam chair, I would say. Thank you
very much. That's all my
question. >> Ok,
committee
members.
Ok.
How did I miss that? Representative
Zor
Representative Zamora for
Dupa.
And we have a second by
ranking member block.
Uh, do we have any
opposition?
Seeing none? We have a
due pass. Thank you. Committee.
