on this. Thank you for that, um,

as I mentioned.
you're in school,
but we will do

the
OK
So we will follow the same.
And your name,
right,
so there's no.
Emma.
Hello, can you hear me?
We can proceed.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh, my
name is Emma O'Sullivan for the
New Mexico Center on on Poverty.
We thank the sponsors for this
bill. We stand in support of
this bill because we believe
that a worker's right to
organize for better working
conditions should be protected.
Recently, the National Labor
Relations Board ruled that
captive audience meetings
violate federal labor rights
because of their tendency to
promote an anti-union message
and in fact coerce workers
against organizing in their
workplaces, and employers can
and do use captive audience
meetings not only to share an
anti-union message to discourage
worker organizing, but also to
make note of which attend of
employees attend and which
abstain, as well as their
reactions to the content of the
meeting. As a result, captive
audience meetings have been
found to have a demonstrable
chilling effect on
labor organizing, creating a
clear infringement of a workers'
rights to organize. HB 84 is
good for workers because it
protects the rights to organize
along with their free speech
rights. It's also practical for
employers. It narrowly defines
the prohibited behavior and
includes common sense provisions
to clarify employer rights, but
most importantly, HP 84 creates
a needed and fair remedy for
workers who suffer retaliation.
For those reasons, we support
this bill and encourage you to
pass.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. And so
we're gonna go ahead to the
audience
stand up.
And
Thank
you, Madam
Um, and this is an issue about
fairness
and
this is an issue about
fairness
and
she protects that employees
are not only issues that we do
not believe that
our workers should be.
of losing their jobs because
they
do
not
uh for all the reasons on this.
Hello.

Any others?
Right
Thank you.
So now we're gonna move on to
the committee.
I.
And then
And thank you.
I was
Look over this
in a lot of things came to mind
and I, and I understand what
you're saying.
the concern I have
is.
offensive.
And
that to me I
I do I do this way.
You know, the
once.
Is.
I ask you a favor.
I.
the statute,
the legislation.
We are
lucky I would say.
look at that it's
Those are the subjects.
And
so when we're talking about
inforcement we're looking at
that down the road, um.
Is to
understand and so if, if an
employee or
to take this.
And then I
take this bears the cost.
To this, if they're illegal uh
because there will be.
But who?
right.
Is
there any cases of, of how this
is playing out in the
are there any examples of how
this is playing out
I was
involved.
That's
produced.
So it is.
And bear with me.
who seems
to be the biggest biggest push
behind this
from.
in the law.
Man.
practical as
it prevents
in answer to your question,
no, no, no.
Are.
or how
many times
that
or how
many times
like that.
one of uh happened in.
2 years ago now,
um, I was organizers to come
down and talk to them about
organizing uh the company hired
a firm of Florida.
audiences.
For
a week my memory serves me
correctly,
at a time were subjected to this
at a time,
um uh um.
Uh, very afraid that they were
concerned about,
and that is what happen.
Um, again, the other thing was
that
false information.
Um,
and they were also threatened
with the loss of some programs
that the hospital was, um.
The hospital was sponsoring in
the community programs that the,
those workers passionate about,
um, because they were providing
services to the community.
So, yeah.
Madam Jared.
It's my questions. Thank you.
Experts.
Representative, you hear me OK?
I'm trying to remember.
Yeah, um, there were, there were
some questions that we needed to
go back and look at.
Madam Chair Representative, uh,
in section 2B, the definition of
employer you will see includes
uh the state or any political
subdivision of look at the FIR
FIR.
If that would be something that
and how it affect that
situation. Certainly, Madam
Chair representative, you, you,
you said the word yourself. It's
part of their job duties. And if
you look in section D2, there is
an exemption issue.
It is exact actions which are
necessary or required to perform
their job duties are exempt from
that, and exception for so, uh,
firstly, the managerial or
supervisory employee.
provisions of this law do not
Madam Chair, Representative,
you, you works internally. I can
tell you this, um, there would
be like, it doesn't sound like
there's a lot of in terms of who
defends the state.
it's advocate for indicated in
the definition, other types of
You don't get in trouble if you
tell people they don't have to
come. You can still have the
meeting.
and procedures are, are
identified in the FIR. They
wouldn't just
And it generally prohibits
public officers or public
employees from directly or
support, you know, or would like
it, that could get me in trouble
out of here.
Madam Chair, get you in trouble
under and it would probably
create an additional.
My recollection, Madam Cha done
in
Or just the one, Adam.
Madam Chair Representative,
there's a room full of people
behind me who could tell you
stories about uh employees
forced to sit through captive
audience meetings, and
threatened, intimidated, coerced
about whether or not they want
to join or form a union in their
workplace. I could, I could tell
you stories till the sun went
down. Oh.
To
Madam Chair, Representative, I'm
not gonna
Identify names or employers
because I don't, I don't want to
in the last 5 years, I could
give you organize a union in the
workplace under either state or
federal law, the employer is
prohibited an influence on the
decision of those employees.
Employees have a union in the
workplace and employers will on
a 1 to 1 a group basis, will
bring employees about forming a
union. You know that's gonna
cause trouble here. Why do you
want to do this? It's going to
create all kinds of problems in
the workplace. We don't want you
to do this.
It makes employees scared
happens. If there's a petition
filed with the Relations Board
in New Mexico.
There is more than captive
audience
will be forced.
To listen to employees so it, it
is a very madam Chair
representative, fair question.
Uh, I litigate where employers
have threatened employees have
terminated employees, have
disciplined and
I, I as they expressed some sit
in meetings like this, I mean.
I know 10 employees of the
things that we're trying to
Madam Chair Representative, I, I
had to sit through a 4 hour
meeting, uh, where I was
compelled to listen to my boss.
Tell me he wants me to become a
Democrat or he wants me to
become a Republican. Uh there is
a, we can file a civil action
against that employer, damages
would flow from that act, but.
As it hopefully obvious, there's
not a lot of ants. I don't
really litigation what I forward
in terms of deciding what the
outline, the question that you
asked, and to the extent they
could identify, it's not going
to be a case where an employee
sit through the meetings but
didn't terminate that employee
because there's no damages in
that situation. In that
instance, there's nothing to sue
go to a meeting and they refused
to go to the measure of damages
there would be the same measure
of damages in any, uh, Madam
Chair Representative, certainly
would have uh recourse to under
the the laws of the state of New
Mexico, there could be an
instant, uh remember punitive
damages are it would, it would
be a horrible story did to an
employee that would subject that
employer to punitive damages. I
have a hard time certainly.
Uh, that
Madam Chair, representative, I
think it's a fair question based
upon the answers that I've given
you. What
Has happened in states where it
has become illegal, is the
employers stopped doing it, uh,
because employers don't like to
stop terminating employees. We
changed the law and we changed
other states.
Madam Chair Representative, I,
I, I think what I nationally to
to create a decent database.
It's, it doesn't, I, I just, I
don't think there's a question.
It doesn't happen very much. It
From my clients, they don't,
won't be compelled to speech
that tries to, that's, that's,
Madam Cha Representative in
terms of the balance that you
raise. Let me can't.
Force people to listen.
So no speech will be stifled.
Madam Chair Representative, uh.
Expert. Um.
Madam.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, uh, uh, Representative and
expert. uh, so.
Before I get started here, from
the 23
Um, legislation that was
introduced to this one. What
changes did you make?
Madam Chair, Representative, we
can't answer that collective
recollection here is that we've
made some minor, minor
modifications uh to make the
bill more, more.
Understandable and.
Madam Chair Representative, how
does this, um,
Legislation
Change when, when we have
similar legislation, I believe
it's uh 120-13, uh, yeah, NMSA
78-1 to say it out loud I sorry
I'm 13. Mhm.
it, it says it's a 4th degree
felony right now if you do that.
Uh, Madam Chair, Representative,
the New Mexico statute that you
refer to simply prohibits
employers from voting
activities. So you can't fire
somebody for being a Republican.
You can't fire somebody from
being a Democrat. The proposed
But it has a completely
different reach and is directly
compelled by an employer.
representative then I'm
understanding, so, so I'm kind
of confused following what uh
Representative Reeb said, you
know, you say you have a lot of
cases, but then you don't have a
lot of cases where you couldn't
state a lot of uh of the in
particular and that there wasn't
any.
Um, damages that you could say.
Yeah. Why are we writing this
that
We can create a mechanism for
Hi Representative Terazas. Madam
Chair, thank you for that
question. So when um,
Our attorney previously
outlined, he could give you lots
of examples of pen.
This bill would prevent the
compelling of those employees to
attend that meeting. When we say
there's not a lot of cases, that
means that a lot of employees
have not been fired for refusing
to attend those meetings and the
whole portion, sorry, purpose of
this bill is to curb that
behavior of employees compelling
and firing employees.
For not attending those
meetings.
So, Madam Chair, Representative,
what you're saying is there,
there's not a lot of cases
because they're not being fired.
Is that what I, I just want to
make sure I heard you right.
Is it not me.
So, Madam Chair Representative,
I think, I think.
You know, we went kind of round
and around last last time on
this, and I think, you know, I
was
Trying to think, think of.
What we, where we live today. We
live in a, in a
You were a hat.
Wear a mask. You don't wear a
mask.
If, um,
If you, if the football players,
even in sports, if they kneel
for a.
Or opening for, I mean, we can
go on and on.
And on
How everyone perceives, and I
think what makes us dangerous.
Is that um.
Sometimes these political
issues.
are different for each and every
our background and our past and
what where we were raised and
what one person sees as
As political, another person
says, this is just.
Doing business. Doesn't matter
what party.
Um
It comes from
There, that happens every day in
this house.
And so I, I think this is, this
is very ambiguous in the way
it's made, because it, you can
get yourself, it's very big.
Um, I'll give you an example.
I had a meeting and it's a
safety meeting.
But it says in here that if it's
required to do this or that by
law.
Then you're exempt, but not
everything is, not everything is
written in law of how you
operate your business. Um.
Can you give me, yeah, so one
example that I gave is I'm
having a safety and
You know, we had employees that
uh Madam Chair, representative
that.
He lived in in the shot some
that didn't, some that believed
in the mask and some didn't.
And you know, you, you, you, if
I have a meeting, I say, look,
guys, we have this particular
situation or take a shot or do
this or that.
And I'm having a meeting to
protect myself from other
liabilities, right? Because I
don't want to get them, I don't
want them to get.
sick.
Ands or reduce the and I.
Talk about it, but uh.
Vaccine or mask.
Then I find myself in a
situation where.
Possibly they don't want to show
up to that meeting.
I think it's dangerous to, to,
to, for us, um, to be to, to get
so far deep into
Um, the day to day of life when
it's just.
Political matters are very
loosely defined.
In my opinion.
Or things that we believe in,
things that we don't believe in.
Things that and
And, and so that
How could you, what, what would
you say to that? And then I'll
get into the, the other part
that you were talking about
because as far as uh um the uh
Damages that would be caused.
What, what would it represent?
Madam Chair Representative, uh,
the, the abstract concern that
you raised is a valid concern.
That is why we have very
narrowly defined political
matters. It is limited, and you
can read the definition
yourself, but it is limited to
elections for political office,
political parties, attempts to
influence legislation.
As long as you don't discuss
those sorts of things in your
safety.
Madam Chair Representative, that
an expert.
That, that happens in a lot of
businesses.
happens and in, in offices,
happens all over the place. Let,
let me give you an example.
If I'm a minor,
I'm running the mine where I'm a
miner.
And
We see let's, let's be, let's
just be honest, Mount Chair
Representative. Most of us, if
we weren't doing what we're
doing here today.
would not know what is on the,
we, we wouldn't even know what
the golden rod is.
We, most of what's going on.
A lot of people are
are not informed with what's
happening in this house as, as
we speak today.
And so that being said, there is
sometimes legislation that is
introduced.
That can stifle a business.
And
Places like the, the mine that
have thousands of employees that
their jobs are on the line.
And our voters
And
Or maybe they say, you know
what, call your representative,
your, your, and just giving them
information, not telling them
you need to vote for this or
not. Look, we're reading into
this, we're bringing this as a,
as information to you as
employees.
This is the way we see that it's
gonna affect.
could possibly affect your
livelihood, our livelihood of,
of.
Doing business in the state.
And they give them specific
information because not
everybody can navigate. Look at
what we're doing right here,
Madam Chair Representative. Look
at how much we're reading here
and having this discussion.
To figure this out.
Your average person that's
working in the workforce is not
Gonna take this much time to
To, to dig into to the
possibilities of how it will
help or affect.
There, Madam Chair
Representative, um, and I, and I
commend you. I mean, I, I agree.
I think there's, there are times
that
Probably some employers.
Even some unions.
People are people and you're
gonna have people that cross the
line, happens.
But I also don't want to stifle
the, the ability for us to have
good conversations with our
employees.
And, and because we're talking
about legislation here, you
brought up legislation that we,
we can't say look.
Um, and I'm talking about this
firsthand, Madam Chair
Representative.
In 2019,
We were very close in
legislation when I had passed.
We wouldn't have a mind in Grant
County, most likely.
It was the same time that minds
like the coal mines up north.
Four Corners area were shut
down.
But our, in our area, we had a
good representative that came
out and, and
And, and with the workout within
the mind, and so forth.
Talked about this and and made
it an example of how this would
stifle them.
And so it, it, it scares me that
we do that, you know.
And that's, that's why we, we, I
think of my wild.
ID representative we wouldn't
support this.
Or I won't support this, that
ability to have good
communication difference it
doesn't matter if, if there's a
union or not, Madam Chair
Representative.
If the legislation and so, you
know.
It had had
Had this
Legislation existed.
Back then
Then they would, they would have
possibilities if they can't
communicate with their, um their
employees concerning the
legislation that was going to
shut down the mine.
Look at the, look at what
happened, like I said, the,
their jobs, it stifles
everything in the community from
taxes to um property values, you
name it.
School, schools, everything gets
affected.
So
I'm gonna, I'm gonna move on
because I think I've made my
point there.
The other point that I wanted to
make, Madam Chair
Representative, is
Um
So let's just say that I, there
is that I am, I'm gonna act as a
mine. Give me that scenario so I
don't have to come up with some
other story, you gotta hear it.
And so be nice.
And so, Madam Chair,
representative, and so we're
sitting there and we say, hey,
you know what we need, we'd like
to call a meeting and, and first
of all, I'm gonna start, most
employers are not gonna call in.
500, 200.
Even 50 employees to talk to him
for 4 hours. That is not
cost-effective. You're
cost-effective. That's a lot of
payroll. That's half a day of
payroll.
Uh, for that many employees to
sit there and just hammer them
for, for, for a week.
But
If I did call Madam Chair
Representative a meeting like
that and give you that we're
gonna talk about.
How this legislation that's in
the House.
possibility of this mind being
closed.
And we'd like for you to reach
out to your representative here
in your senator.
And express yourself.
We're gonna tell you
And
I don't know, Joe says.
I'm not going. We don't have to
go, Bill.
We don't have to
Andy
So a few people don't come and
and it's a, it's a meeting just
to have it. Let's just a little
bit more, then we're gonna have
some, we're gonna talk.
And we said, hey, you know, we
give him a verbal warning, hey,
information.
That, you know, that we think
you need to know. And then later
on it happens again, write them
up.
It happens and then
We say, now I fired them because
they're not showing up. What is
the, cause I didn't see where.
He gave a definite of what the
exposure of that's my question.
I'm sorry. What, what would the
exposure be
maybe asking.
So
can continue.
It is the practice that we do.
We can
Offer in support of
What I'd like to
Just to emphasize is that if the
questions have already been
asked and answered.
That we not repeat.
Because they've been asked and
answered already.
And so if that's your point of
clarification, I also part of
it. I just want to reemphasize
that, um, we don't want to have.
Repeating questions in any way
trying to.
Um
Extend your
We know that there are other
individuals list so that you're
cognizant of that.
If I face.
Are now becoming quaint or.
Perhaps not staying in.
In the framework
Then I'll make thank you for
your, did that answer the
clarification? Thank you. So
representative, um, you were
giving some examples
and then do you mark them, to
make sure that I'm not I'm
trying my artist not to
my last question, Madam Chair,
was um what specific damages
would, would I have? Madam Chair
Representative, I represent
hundreds of coal miners in the,
if you're going to force those
coal miners to listen to your
particular measure of damages
would be how much.
as would any other wrongful
termination lawsuit,
sir. I, I, I don't, I don't
think that we were threatening
or anything, so that wasn't an
educational matter.
I'll just be.
It
would be the last your illegal
action.
So depending on how, from then
on.
I mean, do we know how long this
person, when, when, when does it
end?
I mean, this person's been an
employee, madam chair
representative for 5 years, and
he's, I don't know, he's.
30 years old and he can work.
So he's I mean retirement age,
what are we talking about your
madam chair representative?
Madam Chair Representative, it's
the same analysis as any
wrongful termination claim in
the United States in the state
of New Mexico, you measure the
lost wages, uh, re-employment at
a lower wage, reemployment at a
higher wage is the devil is in
the details and that sort of
thing. And, and I'm sorry, I
really don't know what that,
what that really means in in a
litigation end of it, and that's
why I was asking. So, what you,
what I got out of what you just
said, um, Madam Chair
Representative, is that
basically.
The litigation would be the lost
wages that that 5 years or 10
years of that person's work
life.
And, but if I rehired them,
In other words, I have a choice
that unless I misunderstood, I
have a choice to rehire that
person or more than we're paying
them.
Or I can subject myself to
litigation to how many years of
um that's what I was trying to,
I don't know anything about
Madam, to be brief as possible,
uh, generally an expert is hired
to determine how much wage as a
result of being re-employed at a
lower rate doesn't go on forever
generally. I, I think it's fair
to say that the average
OK.
And that's what I wanted to, to,
to understand. So, you know, um,
Do you see any way we could
amend this?
In any way that could maybe
narrow this.
Better to better define. And I
think that's, that, I think
that's the problem is, is.
What I previously
And could cause potential. I
know it'll cost uh litigation.
The litigation will go up, um,
but
Is there anything that you guys,
uh, uh, Madam Chair,
Representative C that you could
help some of us find.
An amendment that would
suit some of this discussion.
I think the bill is currently
very narrowly tailored and is
appropriate.
Thank you Madam Chair, I think.
I think. So I, I just want to
um.
clarify real quickly.
The keywords we by nature of.
With our employer.
There to maintain and I think
the points that were made
highlighting is that we want to
constitutionally.
Everyone has the, this is what
we stand on. So I just.

That, what is the will of the
committee?
Right
So there's representative Ortiz.

Representatives, you have a Du
pass with this time today,
right, and so we're gonna do 2
things here, um, one is that I'm
gonna ask that everyone please
speak a little bit.
Louder, directly into the mic
we've been asked by those
watching the webcast that
they're not picking up
everything and then right now in
transition, but really we have a
It was a little bit longer I.
Being stubborn, indulging me and
being longer than 5 minute
break.
So representative um Japansy
House Bill 6. You may begin at
any time and to House Bill 66,
establishes that
Under the auspice of the new

development for the last 25
years, uh, and I've analyzed
this bill and I'm happy to
answer any questions
uh representative, are you?
Madam Chair, we stand for
questions. So I've been informed
hands, correct?
We have, so I will now go to
the.
All right, no hands in
opposition, hands from those who
wish to right so as we did
before, we're gonna hold it.
We're trying to protect
everybody um from.
Spreading anything that goes on
that's going on around here. So
if you would just step up to the

Thank you very much, Madam

Madam Chair, members of the
committee, Joan Baker, UA 412.
That's a plumber and pipefitters
Union. Um, we stand in full
support of this legislation.
When you are utilizing tax
dollars, rather, that is
Tax dollars or for gone tax
dollars as good stewards of our
tax dollars.
We need to maximize our
investment.
And if jobs
Done for capital outlay or
public works require prevailing
minimum wage because they
utilize tax dollars, so should
the IRBs for economic
development. Thank you.
Anyone else in favor? OK, I see
no one else. We will
Oh, represent
Mike is very sensitive.
Representative Reed.
then enters into an agreement.
Private entity basically uh
would work with the city as they
issue bonds. So the city issues
bonds the property.
To the company, so it's sort of
some other basic definitions, so
I'm.
To
wage laws and how they impacters
that are.
economists.
Sure, Madam Chair, um, um, uh,
Representative Reeb, there as,
as you probably, as you may be
aware, the public works Minimum
Wage Act is what's called the
Little Davis-Bacon Act, and it's
a state level prevailing wage
Act. Most states at one time or
another have had such an act. I
think 39 states enacted them
during the 90s, a number of
states, probably about 10,
repealed those laws and what
that did was it created what's
called the natural experiment,
where you could actually compare
across state
minds and look at how states
that had maintained their
prevailing wage law compared,
you know, that were otherwise
comparable to states that had
repealed the law and see how uh
construction costs were impacted
and, and there was a great deal
of research because this is a
sort of opportunity the
economists love. Um, but these
natural experiments and so I
there was a large body of
research that was generated at
that time, and that research
tended to show that construction
costs on that did not increase.
There were some
slight increase.
in wages paid to construction
workers, but those increased
wages were more than offset by
the increased productivity of
those workers and the decreased
likelihood of injury. Uh, so,
and it's seen from the pers the
broader public finance
perspective, higher wages often
translate into higher income tax
revenue and lower expenditures
on public programs like
Medicaid. So on that there's a,
there's a large body of
evidence, of course, you know.
evidence is varied, but, but the
majority of studies showed that
the um the states that had
maintained their prevailing wage
laws, in fact, had no increase
in construction costs and, and I
think there's some evidence from
here in New Mexico that that's
the case too, because not all
IRB recipient companies use
minimum wage labor. Some, some
do in fact use prevailing wage
labor.
We, we don't want to compete.
At the cost of going to
construction projects, so.
And
Lead Spanky representative and
experts, um.
I'm kind of bear with me, madam
Chair, and if it was asked.
When
We go to an industrial that
comes after an RFP is put, no,
um.
I, could you just explain this
process.
Cause if we don't have a.
I know there's a process, so
I'll start with that, please,
Madam Chair and um.
So I mean, I have had her
schedules when I think I can,
um, so, um, so basically.
And
Madam Chair. Thank you. That,
that helps some, so when we get
to the, the $60 amount, $60,000
amount.
Um, I know it's not arbitrary,
but could you explain that, how
that was reached works
projects. We are
Simply.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Also and
so when we're looking at someone
addressed economic development.
Um
And I don't know if it was
someone who was speaking for
this or not, Madam Chair.
The
Do, do we ever reach into a a
project where it's cost
prohibitive to not have a
competitive um.
Process
For to get workers.
Madam Chair, leader Spansy, last
question for me is
Are any of our neighbor
Do our neighboring states or any
of these, are they, have they
enacted similar
Sure, uh, Madam Chair, um,
representative.
New Mexico's approach to IRBs is
pretty unusual. I mean, there
are a couple of other states,
uh, none of the neighboring
states that utilize IRBs in the
way we do. So while I would say
no, none of our neighboring
states do it this way. None of
our neighboring states do IRBs
the way we do either. So it's,
it's kind of an apples to
oranges, uh, comparison.
Madam Chair, thank you.
Representative. Next we have
Representative Garcia.
Followed by Representative
Mejia.
Thank you
Madam Chair, um,
And thank you, uh,
representatives.
For bringing this legislation
forward.
Um
In terms of um
Uh, regarding IRBs.
Uh, and the legislation, the.
Basically compels.
Um, municipalities and counties.
That go into an IRB.
With an entity
That uh there be prevailing
wages.
And fringe benefits.
And um
I want to
See
If there's been
Studies, madam chair.
Uh, analysis.
In terms of um
Um
Non-prevailing wage projects.
And prevailing wage projects.
In terms of Madam Chair.
One,
The quality of work.
And 2
The
Higher skilled set.
Because my understanding is a
project that.
There's not pay remaining wage.
Basically settles for.
They dumbed down.
The quality and they dumb down.
The skills level.
But I wanted to hear from you.
And I'm Chapresentative.
If there's been
That analysis is done.
I, uh, Madam Chair
Representative, I'd only add
that there has been a great deal
of research on this topic over
the years. Um, there's a large
body of, of uh peer reviewed
research that really sort of
looked specifically at the
impact of these sorts of laws on
the quality of uh quality of
construction, and there was
pretty strong evidence that in
fact paying states in which
prevailing wages were paid for
public sector, public works
projects, um, essentially got a
better deal because the, the
projects
were of higher quality, more
likely to come in um on time and
on budget, and we're less likely
to be associated with uh
injuries of, of workers or even
fatalities. So yeah, there is,
there is a body of research that
supports all of that.
OK, thank you for that, uh,
Madam Chair, or representative.
Um
Does this, um, I'm sure there's
this effect existing.
Initiatives that are currently
being undertaken.
By municipalities and counties.
On the uh IRB.
Uh, proposal.
Or does it
Does it just um take into
consideration.
Projects in the future.
After the legislation was um.
You know, madam chair, um,
And I think Representative Paul
alluded to this, but um,
The Facebook project in Los
Lunas.
Um
The village of Los Lunas, which
is a municipality.
Um
Established the contract.
In that contract it.
And uh basically laid out the
conditions of the IRB.
But what also attracted
Facebook.
Los Lunas
Uh, because they had a lot of
takers.
throughout the country.
But the takers throughout the
country.
Couldn't quite meet.
The expectation.
On the water rights. So Madam
Chair, what Facebook was asking.
There's a three-phase built.
Out of
The sinner.
That would entail.
Maximum buildout of 5 million
gallons a day.
And uh and that would be phased
in 3.51 year.
Uh, 4.2 the next year.
Um, 5 million in the last year.
So that was quite an undertaking
man share that Los Lunas had to.
Kind of uh deal with.
Unfortunately, Madam Chair.
The way that Los Lunas tried to
justify.
Meaning that
Quantity of water.
Was they were going to use
Liman.
And uh
That was totally in a
inappropriate.
His leader the money is for.
Economic development.
Infrastructure
Building
Road
And that water.
And I introduced a piece of
legislation to clarify that
naturally, it passed
unanimously, except for those
legislators from whatsa County
that word against the
legislation,
you know,
cause you know leader moneys are
not for water rights. We we'll,
we'll have 10,000 businesses
coming into New Mexico to kind
of exploit that, that benefit,
you know, if, if that were to
happen, the New Mexicans without
a drop of water for their.
For their fields and, and, and
their potable water systems.
But um
Um
So Loss is in a pickle right
now.
Because of that, uh, Madam
Chair, um,
Um
You know, this is a good piece
of legislation.
But it's also important to
understand.
What prevailing wage?
What the current prevailing
wages.
In terms of the benefit, we're
already seeing, Madam Chair,
that there is a benefit to the
entity.
They're not having to pay
groceryceipts taxes.
They're not having to pay
property taxes.
So there should be a balancing
that in that chair.
You know, I think that balancing
act.
Is an action like this.
In terms of the prevailing wage.
But what is prevailing weights
of that today.
fringe benefits.
So what we're getting with
prevailing wage is we're
getting.
Quality
And
Higher
And a skill.
and uh I mean employees.
And uh, and thus.
Um
You know,
Economic boosts for local
communities.
That these workers
I I belong to.
I mean if there's
Uh, and, and rightfully so.
They're highly skilled.
And I see that that being a a
good.
And the balancing act in terms
of.
The purpose of the ERB is to
bring entities on board.
Considering these discounts that
they're getting.
And kind of balancing the act
with.
An infusion of prevailing weight
so.
So, Madam Chair, this, this is a
good win-win situation, I feel.
The entities that are issuing
IRBs.
Um
The governmental entities, the
private entity.
That is
Undertaking
The build out of that project.
And then the employees that are
contributing.
You know, to
Those profits and gains of that
entity.
At the same time,
Taking in a fair share of.
The the
Quality
Of work
And their skills based.
Uh
That enhances the project
overall.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Uh, representative.
Representatives.
I think uh an expert, you know,
I
It's an interesting topic I'd
love to hear.
Uh
My colleague
Representative Garcia, he always
has a colorful way of explaining
things and makes me smile and uh
but anyway, you know,
It's, it's a complicated matter.
You can tell just by going on,
but it's not a simple
explanation, and that's what
makes these uh Madam Chair,
Representative, uh.
Colorful, uh
Discussions is because it's not
a, it's not a simple, hey, this
means this is.
Madam Chair Representative, I
think what happens is, is, this
is usually something that
happens in
And
With the agreements with
counties, municipalities, and
trying to promote.
commerce.
promote economic development.
And so that being said, what,
what they're trying worth.
is companies like we'll say
Facebook and I don't know
anything about that project, but
it doesn't matter if it's
Facebook or uh.
IBMer. Maybe IBM is not a a guy.
But you get what I'm saying.
There's all these companies from
all over the, all over the
country, sometimes the world
that are trying to find places
to to park.
Their investments.
And it, it's a back and forth
between
This municipalities.
And IRBs were set specifically.
Lower cost
Specifically made to find
negotiations.
And give them an ability and
it's it's a complicated man. I
like the way you said it, Madam
Chair. uh.
Uh, minority leader, he said
it's kind of a zigzag. It is
kind of a zigzag.
Where they make these um
agreements.
And
It's kind of a weird deal cause
we're getting a bond.
That the developer is going to
pay back.
That they don't necessarily own.
That's leased back from the,
this is kind of funny. He's back
from the, from the, from the
municipal I accurate on that?
Tax abatement, that's correct.
So that, that's right, Madam
Chair Representative and, and
the tax abatements to
incentivize them to come.
Now, I, I like President Garcia
said that we have to have
balance.
I think what we're trying to do
is we see balance in tax relief.
Yeah,
but they're they're bringing in
another way, they're producing.
Attacks
Um, they're producing tax
through payroll tax.
Do
Think about it, they're creating
jobs. They're bringing in jobs.
There's gonna be, there's still
gonna be some sales tax when
it's being built, right?
The construction period and then
beyond that, you're creating
jobs that are in that that.
That they themselves will then
Injected into the economy, so
They're giving up to abate some
of this to attract them.
Madam Chair representative in
another way.
They're benefiting by doing that
uh be
Competitive
Bring a project in.
And create development.
And so, um, it's, it's funny I
listened to all this and I and
my family's really.
Always the way it works, but,
um, Madam Chair, Representative,
a lot of times.
These guys that are in
construction are gonna try.
To
Make these projects as efficient
and so, you know.
Um
They're gonna already be looking
at getting different.
They're gonna be going out and
getting bids on, on different
materials and so forth. They're
already gonna be doing that. I,
I, I.
I don't know that that's is
gonna squeeze in my opinion.
Another $1 out of materials.
Um
Labor on the other hand, is a
big ma what that means.
But um I was kind of
fumbled by, uh, and I, maybe I
didn't understand. I couldn't
hear it where we are tying this
prevailing wage.
Argument
And how that
Definitely
Improves
Safety
If I pay you more, how is it
gonna be safer?
And how's it going to prevent, I
think I heard even loss of life,
and I, I said, how does that?
Generally and prevailing way,
you get uh employees that uh
have been trained or brought
brought through apprenticeships,
uh, safety mentality in these
workers is driven from the time
they start to the first seen
projects with both types of
contractors and uh
I'll tell you first time you can
tell the difference in the
workness or the safety mindset
and uh
So to answer your question, uh,
I think with I don't say you're
guaranteed uh safety, but uh
it's definitely driven through
those.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative, you know, I
was just trying to understand
how, what the connection was.
And so, you know, I think um.
Would you say that the, the
original idea of IRBs was to
Reduced cost, I mean, I mean,
what was that, let me rephrase
this. What was the purpose of
IRBs so that we can
Um
The, the
And I, and I just think, uh,
from the information that I,
that I, I um.
We did some research.
Looking and
It, it just looks to me that
what I read here from um
What was cut and pasted, uh,
when it cut and paint the
industry trade.
Uh, in inducing manufacturing
industrial.
And commercial enterprise, so it
was just a colorful way of, of,
of trying to bring commerce in.
But anyway, um, this also
affects Madam Chair
Representative, many renewable
projects in rural New Mexico
that are that are funded with
IRBs.
I think it's a little bit
different for us than in rural
Madam Chair Representative then.
In, in the urban areas because
it, it fixes more out there in
it, and, and it makes me worry
of
How is this gonna benefit rural?
A lot of times, unfort.
Uh, unfortunately, and uh.
In my
Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm
gonna move on. I'm just gonna
ask, did you get any
endorsements by the uh
Association of Association of
Counties or
Chamber.
Commerce or anything on this any
uh.
pro against, nothing like
anything like that. So how, how
it affects us. I represent.
Yeah
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. I, I talked to a
few counties and they were, they
wanted to, they said,
Can you leave that alone and
leave it up to us. So that was
a, that was uh what I, I got
back from my counties. So I
think
Um
I'll be honest, Madam Chair
Representative, I, I think it
was something that was on the
radar, but I
Again
Through our website or whatever
of not.
But it, you know, within the
notice of this, of this
committee, it was gonna be heard
in this committee.
Um, that, that's pretty much
what I have. I think it's just a
complicated matter. Let me just
make sure I got all my
Um
questions are, man, just give me
a second.
I, I, I was just looking to make
sure I had asked all my
questions. I'm good. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Thank you,
Representative.
Um, the whole point of IRBs as
director at my career and
profession, so they are meant
boarding tax abatements, but all
of the companies reinvesting
really a positive win-win for
everyone involved. So I just.
Representative Ortiz makes a
motion do pass motion seconded.
Representative Vice Chair.
Um, Chavez seconds.
Representative Anaya.
Yes
Representative Garcia.
Representative Hall.
No
Representative Johnson,
Representative Mejia.
Representative Ortiz.
Representative Reeb.
Representative Terazas I'd like
to explain.
Uh
Representative Torres Velasquez.
Vice Chair Chavez, yes.
Chairwoman Royal Caballero.
Yes.
Uh
Do pass on a 64.
Madam Chair, I just wanted to
say I voted no because I'd like
to see what the position of the
associated uh association of
counties is the Chamber of
Commerce and uh what they would
say would be this not being that
I got from the information I got
from my counties. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you and thank you,
Representatives, uh, you have a
due pass,
and I believe.
I don't know if my witnesses
here yet are still here. He was
waiting forever.
I think we're ready, I'm sure
we're going to hear House Bill 9
and then if you would I just
remind you to speak directly in
the mic so that the webcast, um.
Persons can hear you.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm
gonna hand it off to my expert
to uh go over the bill. Thank
you.
Um
OK, go ahead.
Thank you, Madam Chair, uh,
members, public employees
retirement Association.
Um, so what how Bill 96 does is
it uh appropriates approximately
$66 million for us to fund 2% uh
to give the committee a little
bit of a background, um, era
pension reform, all you can
really do is increase the amount
of money coming in, um.
And decrease um stopped at 3%
annual compounding cola, you
reduced it to a 2% annual and
increased contributions coming
in, uh, that reform, um.
Was, was meaningful, but these
reforms take
Decades to really work into the
system. Uh, another reform in
2020 did the same thing. It
changed the 2% cola.
That immediately after COVID
happened, the 3 years after that
passed, our retiree founding
resumed two years ago in the
60th percentile, we're at 67%
currently. We're not, we're not
able to give a cola, um.
What this would do is
Spring, and I hope that will buy
you that wanna go back to, to
be, you know, hundreds of
All right. Anyone here to, we'll
step up and they'll hold the mic
for you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, Carter Bundy asks me,
we stand in full support of this
bill, um.
Our retirees clearly need a
bigger cola. They lost a lot of
ground.
Over the last 5-6 years, um, so
this is a really important
thing, the quality of life of
thousands, tens of thousands,
um, and we've also committed to
the power board and director
that we would only support
something to hurt the long term
solvency of the fund, we believe
this bill does this. We're
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
it's AFL-CIO. We stand in very
strong support uh time when
inflation, I think we could all
agree has been uh quite um
providing uh
No? Yes, ma'am. Madam Chair.
Um, I, I noticed that.
The $66 million appropriation
remains unchanged.
But the funding sustainability
could be in question investment
or not?
Sir, representative.
Madame Chair, I just mentioned
that this money is not in the
budget, uh.
Obviously, it's gonna take a
miracle for us to get this
funding. Um, this is very
important. Uh, we wanna keep
this relevant in the minds of
people. My hope is someday that
our state, uh, fully funds uh.
These pensions to make sure
they're viable, uh, instead of
funding other initiatives, we,
we, we keep seeing ah.
These huge revenues and we keep
expanding multiple programs and
my hope is someday we, we take
care of our, our people.
With the retirements and someday
we're able to give actually
decent raises to our state
employees, so.
Um
I don't know if that answers
your question, but
Madam Chair Representative,
thank you on that.
Is this in I and again I
apologize, this is for because
we have fallen behind.
Because of the massive amounts
of inflation in our nation,
Madam Chair.
Madam sure, yes, that is part of
it like uh uh my expert said,
uh,
We're not keeping up with cost
of living, this is just
To hopefully provide a little
bit of relief to.
Madam Chair and Representative,
I was looking up, uh, at, I
looked at a summary of it and it
says this I may read this.
It
It's for payments for qualified
pension recipients from the
previously expired fiscal years.
was nothing
Hayden
And this is out of ignorance. I
asked this, there's nothing paid
in 24 cause my analysis is 21,
23.
And I was seeing for 24 they our
pair of recipients received
nothing, um.
Madam Chair.
I'm not in trouble.
Is they are getting.
So our retirees did receive
funded ratio. They're always
guaranteed a 0.5% cola with a
ceiling.
Madam Chair
state's big givers.
Pardon my
frustration with that and just I
was not aware of that. Thank
you, Madam Chair, that is my
question.
Madam Chair.
Uh, thank you, Representatives.
Um, we, you've got, we've gone
through a bunch of things, um,
Madam Chair Representative
concerning, concerning the
retirement issue.
Shortfall that you have, I guess
in, in, in $26 billion. Madam
Chair Representative, um,
expert.
Um, I just wanted to make, we've
been hearing this and, and how
much has it exploded in the
last, you know, let's just say
from 2020 like you were saying
with the pandemic, we'll just,
Madam Chair and represent gap I
guess the gap is, I'm sorry to
interrupt but all the gap, how
much wider has it gotten. So,
um, it, it's, it's pretty much
stayed static. We, we have a
funding period, and that's if
you think about it like a
mortgage, that's how we um after
that bill passed year period,
uh, the inflation that retired.
our spirit li.
So Madam Chair, representative,
what you're basically saying is
that the amortization schedule
if you would you call that
amortization schedule that
you're talking about would be
like we're buying a house and
instead of it being
and you've done a remarkable job
under chairs representative to
close the gap. I mean, you said
what it was that we'd never
catch up like we were way
behind um what has closed that
gap, Madam Chair representative?
It helped you bring it down from
infinite to
And that was for all state
workers year deferral, um, and
that has brought in as of last
fiscal year 180 million
recurring into the fund.
The chair representative, that
being said, then.
We're, we're after the bill was
passed. Madam.
So that means that it's gonna
expire soon and uh it doesn't
expire, but the, the phase next
fiscal year. Got you. I'm sorry.
I, I, I didn't catch that. OK.
So,
Help me understand how this is
going to help you.
the gap even more. I'm sure.
It, it
Doesn't really, OK.
So Madam Chair Representative,
I'm just trying to understand
it, um.
So it's just um.
It's going to be a net zero
result, but it helps people. I'm
not saying it doesn't do
anything. I'm just saying
financially it's not gonna close
the gap of, of, um, but it's
gonna help some needed relief,
um, or which type of workers is
this one because there's
different um uh.
terms which and representatives
go to the range.
OK. And
You know, this is kind of
Of question, but
We did return to work and we
had.
And I'm gonna bring this in
because it
I wanted to know what the impact
has been.
So we have returned to work, how
many have you how many people
have returned to work that are
now participating but not
getting the second retirement.
And helping
specific in who could return
representative,
I, I can't really talk too much
about the bill, but I, I, even
though we tried real hard, um,
representative, if you had a
magic wand, you could do
anything else.
That would help this and more to
help balance it.
And and I'm sorry, but I just, I
needed, I wanna get a good
understanding cause you know it
way. Yeah, Madam Chair and
representative we could, uh,
Wave a magic wand and
Appropriate 8. Magic ones too
big, uh, representatives
so
what could you do that would
kind of phase in in the next
1010 years or something.
I gave you too big of one, sorry
not
other uh um contribution
Well, so you know that this for
the committee and, and we're
doing this not only for my
trying to understand and, and
the thing is we're, we're
You know that this is a promise
that we made to all the state
workers that, that we're gonna,
when you. And so it's, we don't
want it to be, I don't want to
use this word, but that.
Um, Madam Chair Representative,
uh, the, the last thing I was
gonna ask you is.
With, with knowing that.
And it sounds to me like you've
already pretty well maxed out
the our from our state workers,
you've were one of the highest
in the state, where there's
really no other way to backfill
this.
You could reduce some benefit.
Nobody likes that. Did you see
that? Did you see represent,
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
That being said, there's not
there, you know, there is no
other way. I was trying to grasp
what are we going to do this?
Uh, we did reduce benefits for
retire or for members that that
anytime you put in a new now is,
we've got about 49,000 a year or
two, those lines are gonna.
It's, um, Madam Chair
representatives cause we're
gonna hit the baby boom fully
and it, and that is what's gonna
break the bank.
Um, it, it, we're seeing more
and more retirees, and yet the
contributions and at the same
time you're gonna have
contributions go down.
It's gonna really that we've got
to be prudent on how we um tier
one members like myself that's
when we really start 2030s.
And then, so.
One of the goals that I had
Madam Chair Representative is if
we could make some, and we need
to talk about this off, but I'm
just gonna mention this to the
committee, um, if we could
possibly.
Work out some, some kinks that
we have on the return to work
bill.
Um
Yeah, that it could possibly
help you bridge that gap.
And this is my last question.
How many people that we would
say this is money going number.
He was a magic wand I was trying
to give you, but you took the
wrong one.
What would that number be? Just,
It's, it helps the fun, but it.
Um
OK, well, thank you very much. I
really appreciate it. I, it
helps understand that right
after.
And um
And understand what, you know,
get a fair sitting down on a hot
seat. That's what I, uh, a
chairman Icon you say you're on
the hot seat, so.
Thank you very much for
answering my questions, Chair
Representative.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, uh, Representative
and.
Expert for
Their presentations, um.
You know, uh, the para and the
ERB.
are not just for.
Pensions are not just for the
members. When I was on the
investment and pensions in
committee, and I was on it.
For a number of years.
Some are familiar with uh.
With Peron, and I really kind of
pity the the rookies cause
they're getting the baptism of
fire, however that saying goes.
First on the prevailing way to
know I'm fair.
So, so I really kind of
Feel for the rookies, you know,
some of the issues that we
undertake in this committee.
But uh for the longest time, I
had been trying to get.
The pair of Director.
And the
ERB director.
Give me a breakdown of a
combined total.
Uh
Uh
GDP
Gross domestic product.
Uh, in our communities.
In our counties.
Regarding
Perra and ERB.
And finally, I got a.
figure. And uh
And this, these pensions.
If, you know, if we have
solvency issues, madam Chair.
Um, and we have to cut benefits.
We're actually cutting
Quality of life
In rural communities.
Because what
What, what these directors came
up with in as a combined total
of GDP.
Anywhere from 13 to 18%.
These pensions constitute
anywhere from 13 to 18% of the
GDP.
In rural communities.
Can you imagine that?
So we have a lot of educators,
state employees.
Up and down the scale.
You know, when firefighters to
clerks.
You know, that are gonna be
hurt, not in not only
individually but community-wise.
If there isn't that infusion of
Revenues and income and those.
The remaining businesses in
rural communities are going to
be hurting also.
So it's significant that we
maintain that stability.
And uh
I wanted to ask.
Greg, um,
Can you share with us, and I
don't know if you have it in
your memory banks, but
Can you tell us what the
paraphon was.
Prior to COVID
In the heat of COVID.
And today.
Payments, um, half of that was
growing at such a rate that it
Fund, but that, that, that
Has reduced greatly and that was
the intent of the.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, well, thank you for that,
um.
That's all I had, man. I'm sure.
Thank you and I really applaud
the efforts of Perrata.
And I really try to keep that.
Bonding up with initiatives, uh.
Uh, creative initiatives to kind
of.
Bring to us.
So we can ensure that that
solvency continues to, to
happen.
Thank you.
Representative Tarais moves a
due pass.
And seconded by represent you.
Is there anyone on the
Tentative um
Representative Dell.
Just, uh, do you have anybody
with you?
OK, so one moment, um.
All right, go ahead and begin
it. Thank you, Madam Chair and
thank you members of the
committee, and I'm, I'm sorry
for the confusion of a rolling,
not rolling, and so I, I, if you
saw my email at my Facebook, how
many veterans are for, um,
getting going ahead and having
the hearing, I'm gonna go for it
because I think it's a good bill
and it should pass. So this
right now in New Mexico State
parks.
Upon verification of 50%
disability or higher.
Veterans can receive 3 nights of
free camping in our state parks.
This is, um,
Primitive camping.
Just changes that, you know,
eliminates the burden on state
parks of having to qualify
someone with based on their
disability, and simply allows
New Mexico veterans to request.
We have a lot of focus.
On behavioral health services
therapy.
We have Heroes on the Water at
Elephant Butte State Park that
take veterans and their families
out on boats, kayaking, fishing.
This is their therapy.
I, it never became more real to
me than during COVID when they
lacked access to New Mexico
State parks.
And the impact that that had on
their, the
pretty tiny price to that I'll
stand for questions.
OK. In support?
Madam Chair, members of the
committee. My name is Joan
Dickerson. I'm with the Veterans
and Military Families Caucus,
and we support this bill and
thank the sponsors for bringing
it. We realized that any benefit
does come with a cost, but we
find that the uh estimate by in
the FIR seems to be a little bit
high as far as the cost, uh,
they have made the assumption
that with veterans making
up around 6.7% of the state's
population, that if veterans
also account for the same
percentage of state park
visitors, providing these passes
would result in a revenue loss
of 361.8,000.
But what they failed to take
into account is over 52% of New
Mexico's veterans are 65 years
old and older, and there's a
diminishing return on how many
of these veterans would be
utilizing the state parks and
actually camping there. Uh, we
would, uh,
Estimate that the uh cost of
this uh program would be much
less than what they have
estimated in the FIR, uh, we do
support this bill and thank you
for your time
now we're going to the audience.
Is there any anyone in support
that wishes to speak?
We will take
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Eric
James, and I served as the
deputy cabinet secretary for the
Department of Veteran Services
and uh the Department of Veteran
Services stands in favor.
Anyone else?
In the audience, yeah,
committee, any questions I
representative Hall.
Madam Cha mind's more of a
statement.
We owe our veterans more than a
cost of whatever the.
Financial report.
So I am wholeheartedly behind
this, man.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh,
thank you for doing this and
bringing this.
Quick question. So I kind of
read it here, um, Madam Chair
Representative.
This is not gonna be specific to
a.
Specific to a 1 day or 3 limits,
it's it's erases everything a
little more.
Thank you Madam Chair and thank
you, and I really need to work
this out. I'm gonna take parts
we talked yesterday. It was just
such, you know, such short
notice that on this, because
right now, they carry the
burdens. State parks carries
ability. So they are spending,
according to the state director,
Hundreds of hours verifying the
laws in this method, you could
simplify this process and just
someone shows up to pay for
their annual camping pass
verifies their military service.
And gets one for free instead.
So there's, we should eliminate
the burden. I wish they'd put a
little credit on that cost
there, but we'll, we'll try to
work on the FIR before the next
committee.
And Madam Chair representative,
that's kind of where I was going
with this. I mean, think about
it, you go over there, how you,
how are you gonna verify right
there and, and if so.
Who, who keeps an eye on, is it
a day? Oh wait, he's here today.
What is your percentage of
disability and I mean it gets a
little too invasive, which
sometimes
Uh, Madam Chair, Representative,
would you agree that we can
overcomplicate things through
government regulation. Thank
you, Madam Chair and
Representative. I think it's
overcomplicated, um, and then in
addition to that,
The paperwork that the state
parks is choosing to implement.
I, I, I, I really hope
That we can rectify this FIR
before the next committee.
And
to just ask.
For a more realistic, uh,
number, how many of our disabled
veterans are going through the
process.
Well, uh, Madam Chair
Representative, I think what
happens here, sometimes we just
look at one end of the equation,
right? It's kind of like when
you work at a
You.
Your first, your first job or
whatever, you really understand
a lot about business, but
you're, you're sitting there at
the cash register and go, oh my
gosh, it's tons of money, you
know, they're looking at the
cash coming in, coming in,
coming in. The guy in the back
that's paying the bills is
going, oh God, we need some
more, we need more money than
that to pay the bills and keep
the lights on because he's
writing all the checks going
out, and I think that's what
happened here, Madam Chair
Representative, I think they
only looked at one side of the
equation, they said, hey, this
is all the veterans.
And this is assuming, uh, Madam
Chair Representative that all of
them are going to use it and,
and the
Balance it.
With the, the, the savings that
they're gonna have the hours
that they, they, they do all
that.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Representative. I mean, to
be fair, state parks is an
enterprise fund, you know, I, I
even now have Elephant Vita.
I'll have these beautiful state
parks in our district, and they
are, and I frankly, I don't
think they get enough money. I
was going to take this out of
the state parks fund, which has
a balance of 0. I think we
should fix that, especially if
we're trying to promote tourism
in New Mexico. So I parks more.
And Madam Chair Representative,
I think you took my next
question,
how come you're reading my mind
today. So, Madam Chair,
Representative, I think what it
is, what where I was going with
that is that's exactly right. We
have a, we have a, we're, we
have all this surplus of cash.
And we're we we're talking about
promoting this is like you and I
should uh choose two counties in
our districts before
redistricting, we know we know
what all those.
City of rocks means and we know
what entry fees and the thing
is,
I would love for us, Madam
Chair, Representative, to keep
the fees low, because that's our
natural play can't afford
Disneyland.
Ticks was there heavy dollars to
go over there, or we can go to a
place and let your kids enjoy
themselves at different state
parks, different places at for a
reasonable cost, but that means
still for the director and the
please if he's listening, I'm
sure he is today, um, Madam
Chair, I'm not putting it down.
I think you, you, you mentioned
why things didn't get balanced
out, but um it's only 2, to
encourage uh the legislature to
uh to appropriate more funding
toward that, those needs so and
and guess what, Madam Chair
Represent
Our little parks that we have in
rural New Mexico.
I live there. Guess who's coming
to visit him?
They leave Albuquerque to go
leaving from all over the place,
come visit our little parks that
we, you know, our state parks,
so it's good for everybody and
I'd like for us to see more
investment in that. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
So, um, next we have
representative.
Thank you, Madam Chair, I just
Thank you, madam. And I, I will
get confirmation on this, but I
think our veterans state agency
is around 9 99 million. That's,
that's not even 1%, right? Oh,
representative Garcia, I'm so
sorry.
I didn't you representative.
You know, when you went over.
Uh, to my table there on the
floor.
Uh, to ask for my.
Osigner.
Yeah, but, um,
Endorsement
You mentioned
The number of legislators.
In the legislature.
Can you, can you tell us what
that is?
Yeah, we, we, I was, I'm great,
I knew if I came to you, I
appreciate it. Yeah.
Yeah, well, we need to enhance
our veteran membership here in
the legislature answer. I think
they
A lot of our veterans
legislation and
It's gonna create a void for a
while anyway. Well, I, I don't
know.
Well thank you for picking up
the slack you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you Representative Garcia.
So on that note, I wanted to be,
um, I have a bit in and the same
Dinner. We haven't said it yet
to confirm. So now what is the
will of the committee pass,
Madam Chair.
Representative
Representative Orte second.
It's OK. We need to do a
rotational here that's OK. So is
there any opposition?
Thank you. Thank you, Madam
Chair. If anybody wants to sign
on, it's, uh, you can go to the
clerk's office. I'd love to have
more names on it. Thank you.
I'm sure with, when it comes to
the dinner.
Uh, is it true that make
enchiladas for all of us.
That's you, you're going to have
to go and convince him to do
whatever
we are.
That's true.
No, recess. We are in recess
until, what's today?
Thursday until next Tuesday.
I'm sorry, I told her.
At
Sorry, um, I failed to let you
know that at the last minute we
did have a request by um.
The sponsor of House Bill 146,
um, to roll this. I appreciate
that now now.
Good to go. Thank you. Have a
good weekend everybody.
