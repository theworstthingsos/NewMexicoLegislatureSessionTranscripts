So now we go to the committee
and representative, vice chair,
thank you, Madam Chair
Representative, and my comment

And there's also
One of the things that I would

At some point in time is really
do an analysis in terms.
Thank you, Madam Chair, uh,
personnel, there's been
In what time frame is that 2
years or?
As of, as of
Um
Alrighty, thank you, Madam
Chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative. It was a
great bill and I know that we've
had some, um,
Difficulty with people joining
or probably little um slivers of
legislation that probably needs
a little bit work uh of
wordsmithing so that we can
help, uh, in, in some of the
sectors like, you know, what
we're doing today. Um, and so.
I know that the some of the uh
officers.
Had, um, they've been reaching
out to us knowing that I was on,
on that bill when it was passed
and we're wondering if we could
add some language.
That would um uh it would be so
simple as candidates for
certification who meet all other
requirements for the waiver.
But successfully graduated from
the academy with fewer credits
than is now required will be
granted recertification. And,
and that was because there's
some of the people that when it
comes to some of the physical um
requirements, uh, they sometimes
if you're older and you're
coming back to work and maybe
that's, you know, if, if the
employer sees that.
We can still use you, but that
certification is hanging over
their head, possibly physically
because of their age, can't
handle that, but they can put
them in a sector or department
that they would work to that it
could.
Um
He fill
vacancies that is much needed,
especially with someone that's
retired and has already, uh, the
work experience that is needed,
um, for these vacancies, uh, at
the same time then.
Uh, fulfilling all the other
requirements of payment, so
forth that uh
Helps the whole overall.
Uh, idea of the bill, the intent
of the bill, would that be a
friendly amendment if I made
something like that and if I
did, where would you suggest it
if it was friendly, where would
you put it in the bill?
Um, thank you, Madam Chair. I
don't know where we would add
it, but that that is the intent
of the bill.
Uh, we're not
They can come in and fill some
of the gaps, but mostly serves.
So I mean, depending on where
you wanted to add it in the in
the bill.
Um, I think it goes with the
intent of the original bill. um.
Madam Chair, Representative.
I, I was looking at this and I
don't know if it's on on.
Um
It would be section F.
Page 5.
Maybe after C.
We just add D in there. I'm not
sure if that's the right.
I used to put that.
Mad, Madam Chair, if, if I
could.
Um, I'd be willing to work with
Representative Terasa.
House appropriations cause I
think this would need to be.
Put it in the, the right
section. Yes.
Um
And I'm not sure that we, we
would have time to fly, but I'd
be, I'd be willing to work with
you.
That'd be great. That's all I
have, Madam Chair.
And are there any other
questions?
Any other questions?
motion for a due pass, ma'am.
I'll in that

And it was seconded by
Representative Terazas.

the bill?

amendment and then have you

wait for a minute to have
everything passed out. And Madam
Chair, I gave you the amendment
printed out so you don't have to
scratch out anything or
anything. I gave.
gave you the amendment. I'll,
I'll print it, so they don't
have to worry about, yeah, we we
we're passing both out and yeah,
thank you for that. That was
extremely helpful.
At least to me you have she's
passing out both.
Yes, it's
So, um, just for committee
members, what was very helpful
the um highlight in the second
sheet.
The way that the amendment is
applied to the bill so that it'd
be an easy read for everybody.
Very good.
Adam Chair move the amendment.
And you're ready to go whenever.
So, let me get this clear, Madam
Chair, you want me to explain
the amendment or yes please it's
really just clean up, Madam
Chair, um, we added business to
10 days. We didn't, um, there's
not a whole lot of changes that
are
for
Let's give the members then
changes as they relate and
they're highlighted in red.
On the amended copy.
I
2nd page, so that made it easy
for us based on the conversation
of personal privilege. May I?
This is really all the time.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair.
My LA did it. I don't know. She
said, here. And I was like, OK.
And, and so I thought
to make you guys always do this
for everything.
So you, um, representative
Sarena, you began something here
that I think all of us
appreciate. Thank you very much.
So.
Um
We still have to follow our
regular protocol here so.
Even though
I think we still have to go
through the Zoom that she may be
observing, OK.
All right. Anybody in the
audience who wishes to speak in
favor, I don't see anybody and
nobody's here, OK, um, so to
committee.
Any questions on the?
All right.
Yeah, that is the, the hand ra
oh, OK.
Uh, Miss Deborah Condit, you may
go ahead and address us on House
Bill 159 at
Mm
Good morning, Madam Chair.
Deborah Conn did, I'm the
registered lobbyist for In West
Energy Alliance, um, we don't
support or oppose this bill,
we're kind of in the middle
right now, so I guess this is
the time for me to raise my
hand, uh, the renewable energy
industry believes in the
compatibility of national
security and the clean energy
transition. We work with the FAA
and the US Department of Defense
Clearing House to ensure
renewable energy projects do not
have adverse impacts on
military.
operations.
We appreciate the sponsor's
willingness to work with the
industry to amend the bill so
that it functions as intended.
Today's amendments clarify
important technical distinctions
around FAA and DOD review. We
are grateful for the sponsor's
partnership and work to make
these changes. However, we
continue to be concerned that
the 10 days for notification is
too short and encourage further
changes to allow for 30 days in
which to notify the parties. We
note that Oklahoma allows for
this reasonable amount of time
for
comparable notification
requirement. We also seek
clarity on the effective date.
It's unclear whether this bill
only applies to projects who are
beginning to review at the DOD
clearinghouse or if projects mid
review process becomes subject
to the requirements. Uh, we look
forward to continued, uh,
conversations with the sponsor
on this bill, and thank you
committee for your time.
Thank you. Is there anyone else
online?
Wishes to speak.
The, who is that person?
Hi, this is Claudia Reisner. Can
you hear me.
Yes, um, good evening, Chair
Roba Caballero and members of
the committee. Um, this is
Claudia Reisner. I'm a Navy vet.
I'm a member of the New Mexico
Veterans and Military Families
Caucus. We support House Bill
159 and its efforts to help
safeguard our military,
especially military aviation
personnel. Any facility
constructed near one of New
Mexico's 4 military bases, has a
potential impact on the safety
of military personnel and
aircraft, HB 159 would help.
Coordinate future construction
or expansion of existing
facilities with a military-based
planning commission. We stand in
support of this bill, and I
think the sponsor and the
committee for this opportunity
to speak in support of it. Thank
you.
Thank you.
Any others
Um
Has the committee already had
enough time, so one question,
uh, representative Tarazas
Madam,
is there any, was there any
reason that you had any
heartburn over the 30 days?
Is that a big deal too?
Madam Chair, uh, Representative,
we went back and forth, so we,
it was 10 days and then we made
it 10 business days, but it's
just a notification bell.
And um.
We could do, we could, we could
change it to 30 straight days
but not business days I think
that's I think that's great, uh,
if everyone would accept that
amendment. I, I would.
I would support that. I think it
just make it days not business
days, I agree. So.
Do we want to amend this now on
the amended bill on this
amendment?
I think we would
One second.
Bundy, no. What do you want to
do? All right, that's fine.
I'm sorry to interrupt. Adam,
just a point of clarification.
If we were going to do an
amendment and
We're we're, yes, that's what
I'm asking. We're going to, yes.
Any other questions on the
amendment? All right,
now to adopt the amendment
on emotion.
Thank you Madam Chair, now on
the bill.
Um, is there any, uh,
Oh
No, we moved it already for
discussion. OK, so now we vote.

Thank you.
All right, so now we are on the
vote.
Um, in favor of the amended
amendment, sorry, uh, any
opposition to the amendment. Is
there any opposition? All right.
Representative, you have an
amendment.
You know um.

So

committee, Paul Cassidy with the
military-based planning
commission, uh, Kirtland
Sustainability Committee and
Kortland Partnership Committee.
