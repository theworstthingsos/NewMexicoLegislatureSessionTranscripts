Senate District 25.
I'd like to welcome everyone
here to this
proceeding. Before
we get started, there is a
preliminary
development that I think is going to
change the course of
what happens today. And I want
to yield to Alexis
Johnson who is counsel for the
State and then
give MS Lamboy a
chance to respond
from the city's perspective.
So Alexis won't you come up
and turn the
mic.
>> Good afternoon, Chairman Wirth
and Members of the
Committee, the
board,
we have a brief statement from
the General Services
Department on behalf of the
State,
the State of New Mexico
acting through the General Services
department and Facilities
management withdraws
from the current process of the
formation of the State and local
government historic review
board referred
to as review
board
as formed to date.
Thus, the State is withdrawing
from the review board process
specifically initiated
on May 23rd,
2024.
The State seeks to dissolve
or stay the board
process.
This request will
enable the
initiation of formal
and more complete design
phase. A more
complete process of
review which is the collaborative
process under
section 3 22
6 D.
Thereafter, the
processes of 3
22 6 E
and F
shall be engaged as
needed. So follow
on to
formations
and review, collaborative
review and further
thereafter, if issues
of design remain
unresolved,
the city or the State
can initiate the formation
of the review board process.
Once again,
nothing in the
state's withdrawal. Today
waves the state's right
or any opportunity
to initiate or
reinitiate the
review board process to
consider future
design of the
EOB Capital Outlay
project including
design plus demolition.
As May all be proposed
as part of the Executive
office building capital
Outlay
project.
And with that, I close.
>> Great. Thank you and MS Lamboy.
Do you want to
respond?
>> Thank you, Senator Wirth and
Members of the Committee, I really do
appreciate all of the
work that you have put into this,
all of the reading the
information. I'm cert, I'm
certain that you had questions
formulated in your head
too. So,
um I know it's been a lot of work and I would
like to thank the the
board for
being here and
being willing to volunteer
to help through this
process. So,
um there is a major public benefit
to historic preservation
and there has been a
discussion with the State
for quite some
time about
what the proposed design
is versus
preserving of historic
buildings. The historic districts
review board consider
carefully the request
by the State
and um we
are happy that the
State is willing
to step
back and have
a collaborative process
regarding the design,
I would invite all the people
here to participate
and um that
collaboration, we
will be having additional public
meetings so that people
can review the issues
and be aware
of any concerns
as well. So
um it is a bit disappointing
to find this out at the very
last minute
because there has been a lot
of work put into this.
But um it is
important that the State and the city
collaborate and
I don't disagree with that.
So, thank you.
>> Thank you, Miss Lamboy.
Just so based on,
on this decision, I, we're
not going to proceed with a
hearing today.
The analogy I had, it's
similar to
someone going through the board,
filing an appeal to the City
Council and then deciding
they're not proceeding forward
a couple of really important points
that I want to stress
one. I
do think that the
collaboration
uh is the critical
component of the statute
and it's what Speaker
Luhan envisioned
and I see Rad Acton
sitting in the back and Frank
Katz and uh
I was there when we
did the parking structure
and we were actually at the
table doing the design
and we went from a four
story kind of
Malike parking
structure to something that works
well and works within
the fabric of this Capitol
Complex.
That's what was
envisioned. And
unfortunately, I think the
way this got presented,
that collaboration did
not happen to the extent
that it needs to happen.
I would also note that
the historic
design review board in
approving the demolition
of the conch Ortiz
building conditioned
that on reviewing
the State plans.
So there's gonna be a review
of the State plans and there needs
to be a building of those State
plans quite frankly with
the various folks that are
mentioned in the statute
and that needs to
happen before
we get to the point of triggering
this, which unfortunately,
you know, has gotten somewhat
divisive and it shouldn't be divisive.
That's not what we were trying to do
here. Uh The beauty
of this statute is
that it
was a recognition. And again, I
give speaker Lujan the credits.
It was a recognition that we
have this extraordinary
historic fabric
in our capital city,
but we also have an
amazing Capitol
complex and we're thrilled,
I can say, speaking for
constituents in Senate District
25 and myself,
I'm very glad we have the Capitol
here. Uh
I assure you this building,
which again,
in the mid sixties, my grandfather
was involved in redesigning
through a similar collaborative
process.
This I can't even imagine
what, what, what it would look like
had this been presented
today.
Uh And again,
with no
kind of collaborative process
in statute. So we've
got something in statute that makes
sense. I
appreciate uh what
the State has done here in this
decision because I think it's a step
back and I want to
be really clear
that by, by making this
decision under
section I of the statute, the
State agencies shall not take
any irrevocable
action on the construction or renovation
of a State building until
the procedures set forth.
And subsections F and G of
the section have been followed.
So nothing's going to happen. I just
want to reiterate that, that's,
that's part of this. We're not gonna
have an effort
to demolish or anything along
those lines. I think what is going to
happen is
starting a
new with the plan and
what it looks like, making sure
that the proper reach out is there
to the city and to the
historic preservation community
so they can get the appropriate people
at the table. And
then I just think this will be a much
easier process for
both those on the city historic
design review board if there's a plan
in front, so you can see what's
coming. Uh But
also the goal is to
quite frankly avoid ever
having to be here
doing this. There's a
reason this has
never been invoked
and that's because of the collaboration
that's going on in this community
on these issues. And so
that's where we are today.
Um So we're not gonna
have presentations
or public comment or hearing because
again, it's been withdrawn.
Um But I,
again, I yield if any of
the Members, I appreciate
everyone stepping up.
Uh as I did when I
found out I was getting
appointed to this, but if any of the
Members would like to say anything,
I think there's certainly an opportunity to do
that. Otherwise, we're gonna
wind this up. So I yield to any
Members if you'd like to. Yes,
Mr. Army,
>> I'm just curious
uh if
they, are they proceeding
to design
with thought and mind of
keeping the casitas
or
are they
designing
with the thought of
tearing them down? I mean,
how can you design if you don't
know what's gonna happen with
the casitas?
>> So again, I think we're
gonna see what comes
certainly, there could be a design
that does both. Uh
I think that's gonna be the
process and what I would expect
would happen is that
when the proper folks
uh sit down around the table and
see where the State is and what's being
presented, we're gonna find out what
direction uh they're
taking on that. And
again, I think that's gonna be one
of the key pieces that I
think the historic design review
board has wanted to
determine, is, you
know, is there a design possible
that keeps these buildings
or is, or does the
fabric of
this? Because remember,
we're in a historic building here
as well and we've got the Baton
building, uh the fabric
of the historic Capitol
Complex. How does that
factor in?
>> So, is this
commission gonna have any
further input as far as
what goes on from this phase
on?
>> So, I don't think
so. Under the statute
again, I think it really is a
reset. Um
And it's, it would be similar
to
you have a client that presents to
the historic design review
board. Uh There's a
decision that's
appealed and
then the client makes the decision
not to mov'e forward with the
appeal. So you're
back to square
one. Certainly
we May be back here again
down the road. I'm not
saying that and whether it's this
group or how that all works
to be determined. But
uh again, I think it's, it really
is a reset at this point.
Thank you.
Anyone else?
Yes, Miss Rios.
>> So you are telling us
that once
the uh
State is ready to
present, they will be
presenting to the historic
districts review
board.
>> So madam Chair, I think before we
get to that madam Chair, madam,
it's Rios before
I'm so you're so used to being the Chair
you get deferred
to.
>> That's >> no
before, before we get to that
point, I think there's gonna
be a collaborative
process. But then yes,
I think that that's what has to
happen. Uh It will
go back through that process
for sure. The difference
being there will be
a plan that has
been worked on collaboratively
that's presented along
with the demolition
requests if those
requests are still
presented again.
Uh So I think that's the
distinction. So in effect
the decision of the H board
to allow demolition
of contra Ortiz
pending review of
plans, uh
those plans would be
forthcoming and
then we will have a decision
that will be
on the books by the
board. The board has ruled
here that doesn't
change. So the
board has ruled based on the
demolition that's still in
place. I think that
doesn't mean that the State can't come
back and present a
different request
with a set of plans. I think that's
the big difference is a collaborative
process, not
just doing this
piecemeal.
Thank you. Great.
Anyone else?
If not, thank everyone
for coming. Um,
a little bit anticlimatic,
but I think it's a
good step forward,
so appreciate it. We're adjourned.
