All right, I'll
assume the silence means that
it's 115,
but our director
with our
um work plan
for this interim. So
please
director
>> uh Good afternoon,
Mr Chairman Mr Vice
chair and members of the
committee. And thank
you very much
um
or
um
providing a space to
present the work plan for
you all. Uh We will
be seeking your approval
uh through a motion
and vote on two things
this afternoon. The
first is our work plan and
then the second will be our
actual interim schedule.
So there's two things,
the last
or the latter, the the schedule
is pretty quick. We'll be able
to look through that and you.
Um So it's easier.
Uh but the work plan is
fairly detailed.
I'm gonna take my time going
through it. Uh And
I have uh our
team right behind me,
the analysts. So that should
you have any questions?
Uh They will also be here
to answer questions. I
I want to start by thanking
you very much for your support.
It's an honor. I always
say that, but I very
profoundly deeply mean
that this is
um my favorite
job I've ever
had
and Um
I love serving you.
So uh I
love the team that we
have and that we've built.
Uh you should know
that they are incredible
and we will
never fail to say that over
and over again.
Um So I'm gonna just
move quickly to
slide number two,
with four objectives
in reviewing the work plan.
There's actually two documents
for you in the binder.
The first is a slide deck
that I'm going to use to review the work
plan. And then the second
document that follows the
slide deck is the
actual very
detailed work plan.
I probably won't refer
to that too much. It's there
for your perusal for you to
take with you. It's
very detailed. I have asked
all of the analysts in the work
plan to actually develop theories
of change
um that
should support you in terms of
thinking about timeline
long term trends
as we uh begin
to really deeply study
education. Uh that
is our charge. Um
And most of all
your charge.
Um So our objectives
today are
to again
review the purpose of
an actual work plan or
the LES C work
plan, provide an
overview of the framework
through which a staff
operates on your behalf
and for you. And
um and then the
road map that you have
established is a vision
for um
excellence in education in
New Mexico. And
importantly,
um answering
the lawsuit, the Martinez
Yazzie consolidated lawsuit,
which is a very
real and important
um
part of the work
of the legislature and the state
and really contending with
that,
um truly
contending with that,
the third objective is then
to review each of the
analysts projects.
Um And
uh and then review
four projects
that we have for this
interim, a few
of these projects
you'll know uh are
long term,
they're not
just intended to be studied
this year.
Um
But a few of
them are very timely.
And so keep an eye
out for that flux
of time and or
in intentionality
in the work that we
do.
So I want to begin
with uh sort of this
idea of the work that we do
in a logic model um
that would ground that
grounds staff
and how we support
you as a committee.
So logic model should
demonstrate how
change happens.
Um
What we ultimately hope for
in terms of impact.
And I, I'm actually gonna start on
the right hand side with
impact where we
hope to be what
we hope to have an impact
on. And
I have there five
particular bullets,
student outcomes
and those are all sorts
of outcomes, not just
student achievement in the way that
we traditionally think of student
achievement or student growth
or progress in terms of
academic progress.
Um But socio
emotional health and well
being um
a whole assortment of outcomes
that we're hoping to support you
with and understanding
um in the work that we
do
we also hope to have
impact and support
you in documenting
or thinking through this impact
with how the
work of education leads to
healthy communities.
Finally, uh
in addition, expert and
valued staff,
uh you heard very eloquently
from Belen this morning
about the notion of
surrounding yourself with important,
of vital
um critical,
important,
wonderful staff.
Um And we hope that
would be the case for every school
district. Um and every
charter school across New
Mexico
um improved
systems. Uh
We all um and we have
said over and over that education
is a system of systems.
So how do we improve
all of the systems as they work
uh simultaneously in
and with each other
and then impact in terms of
the uh response
uh legitimate and
true response to the Martinez
Yazzie consolidate consolidated
lawsuit, honoring the
work of the legislature that
has happened
uh in a
very consistent
and committed manner and
continuing to do so in
uplifting that
work.
So logic model
then sort of backwards
map backward maps
from that actual
impact to what are the resources
that go into getting
there? Um Certainly
for you as a committee, it's your
stakeholders,
partners, information
that you receive your
team that serves
you us
as a team that serves
you uh the
activities that
support your work,
your decisions, your
policy, um uh
that you hope for
that is our work plan. That
is the very purpose of the
work plan is that it
fits this logic model and
hopes to get to uh
impact
a budget design,
any analysis that
we do um
and particular member requests
of which we um are receiving
more and more. I'm happy to say
that uh we're receiving member
requests outside of the LES
C from the larger legislative
body. And I think that's a really good
thing in terms of trust
in the staff
work.
Um And I can share some
of those as well. Um
Outputs
the direct output you receive
from the team in particular
are policy briefs,
larger reports from
larger items that we study
you'll see in the work plan,
memos or memorandum that
you can request of us in terms
of seeking information at
any point at any time.
Um And program
evaluation, which is going to be a
big step for us to do
some very
authentic meaningful
program Eva valuation
on some of the investments that the
legislature has
made
uh outcomes as a
result of those
outputs then
are committee endorsed
legislation,
responsive adaptive
policy as
you
think about policy as it
shifts over
time
and budget recommendations
that come out of the
committee.
So I use that
to ground
again, the purpose
of the work plan and how it fits
into this larger vision
of the LES C and
how you
operate.
The next two slides are gonna
show a little bit of the
how and
what
of the committee,
how we as a staff
hope to help you.
First is this framework
in terms of policy making and
budget sort of the
how of how you
operate as a committee and
lifting up how
thoughtful you
are.
Um I think that
you ask of us and
we um
um
operate in such a way
that um
reflects the thoughtfulness
of educators to
be honest yourselves as
educators as, as a
committee.
So the framework
employs sort of five
components or principles.
The first is that
the team, we
as a staff support you
with research and evidence-based
policy and
program.
The second is that
we hope as a team
to ensure that you
are receiving community
voice support
value and contextual nu-
nuance. All of
those are inherent in the process and
resulting policy considerations
that we put in front of
you.
Um We know that your
constituents are your
priority and we
um endeavor to really support
you through that. The
third is appreciating
social connectedness
um relationships
as educators, you know, that relationships
are fundamental to all
work. And
so when you think about
systems design, you think about
it in terms of both very
um um
targeted
design
in system, but also
allowing for emergent
systems in the work
that is involved with
relationship building,
hoping to always
continually
reflect on
and improve relationships.
Um Even though in the most
difficult of
spaces,
uh number four is
understanding, implementation,
science is always
a factor of any policy
or program that is
created.
So whoever is
managing implementation,
how implementation
happens, the resources,
the capacity that's involved
at any state agency for
any school district, for any
charter school, all
of those um are
really vital to what you
would hope for in terms of a large
scale policy that's
made. Um
And in that
sense, our dynamic
and programmatic work
or policy that you hope
for actually
can simply
reinforce the status quo
become a mirror for
existing what what
already exists and
or, and that can be a positive
thing or it
can you can help
to improve
capacity and again
build healthy communities.
But by understanding that
implementation, science
will follow
the policy decisions that you
make
and last but not least
that um a
approaching each,
each action as a
committee um
through an adaptive lens
allows you to um
understand what are
the implications that
happen through policy,
both benefit
and or um
consequences that you,
that we as a as a
staff in particular uh
did not uh
foresee.
And so how do we help you
in terms of making decisions
with policy um
in an adaptive
way?
The what then
in terms of our work plan is
really grounded in the
four
tenants
and these were established
initially in the roadmap
and then again, reiterated
in our um
annual report,
but these tenants um
are sort of a guarding light
as staff and supporting
you and your vision, what we have
heard from you um
continually
um
how do we address
build, evolve
um And or support an
excellent system of public
education, New Mexico.
So the first tenant
is
policy and budget
that support a
diverse
um high quality,
vibrant educator,
ecosystem
educators that um
are um and educate
by educators. I mean, all of the
adults that are serving students in our
state
and they are
the
heartbeat of the
system.
They are the most important
component.
The second is
academic design
and what
policy budget
uh do you decide on and
or support uh
that promotes rigorous,
culturally relevant,
engaging, meaningful
academic design for
um
schools,
whole child systems.
Wraparound supports
interventions, extended time
enriching, programming
tutoring um
with flexibility and
or the support that um
districts need or
claiming for that are
targeted and really
are meaningful because
all of those are very,
they're critical.
Again, you heard from the school
district, the
um how important
community schools was to
Berle? Um You
do see the very
vital need for tutoring, high
dosage tutoring across
the state. So these
systems are are
are essential
and then last but not least in
terms of um a
tenant that we feel
is uh critical.
And what we've heard from you all
is is this roadmap
or vision to continue
on? Is this
foundational infrastructure
if you will that brackets
and supports the school uh
public education
system?
Um
Infrastructure is
various but
this is the notion of system
of systems, uh
data and accountability
system that is
functional. Um
allows for reciprocal
accountability. Um
allows for you to understand
what's happening with the system as
well as the superintendents, our
charter school leaders.
Um uh all
policymakers, the public education
department, vital
components. So how
does the system really
serve the needs of
all a
responsive effective school
funding formula. You'll hear more
more about that um
that ideally would
encourage outcomes based
budgeting a governance
structure that allows
for again, system of
reciprocal accountability.
Um and then items such
as capital outlay, transportation,
broadband technology,
and school
safety.
Uh With that, Mr Chairman, I'm going
to move to the third
objective uh which is
gonna take up most of the time
and I'm going to go
over um
the work plan, the
individual projects of each of
the analysts back here. And
I'm gonna ask them to
um self-identity
and waive
when I uh point
out their work, uh I'd like to
honor their, their work uh
that they put into this
as we are preparing to present
to you. Um
Again, you have a team of
really
incredible analysts.
Uh So the first there in
alphabetical order
is Merrit Andrews. Uh
her research area
is whole child
education. You'll
note, I'm gonna say this
from the beginning that
Merritt and Jessica
uh Hathaway who are sitting
side by side uh
really partner quite
a bit for our team.
They are um
strong leaders
for the team in terms of
providing leadership as
analysts, but they are
also partners in that.
Their work is very,
very similar
except for merit
focuses on
early childhood.
So birth sort of
early childhood education
through elementary
and Jessica
focuses on secondary
up through into the
workforce. So
you'll hear a lot of the
same ideas in terms
of research, um
um grounding
principles in terms of whole
child student
success, deeper
learning um
and um socio emotional
supports to get to
really meaningful academics
very similar from both of
them. But there's
particular things in the
work plan this year that are
um that they focus
on that are connected
with their particular um
spaces in terms of early
versus secondary
education.
So the first thing that Merritt
is looking at this year
is her continued
work around special education.
Uh This is a long
term um
study on your
behalf. Um
We have heard loud and clear
that this is something that the
legislature needs to pay
attention to.
Um You've
heard from many, from several
members. This is something that they'd
like us to continue to look
at. Um We
plan to continue to study
this for actually
five years.
I think it's important that we
track long
term trends in special
education um
and identify
uh policy
decisions that can um
uh policy considerations
for you in terms of
that. Um What might
have an impact uh for
special education,
special education involves
curricular decisions,
funding decisions,
staffing decisions.
It's, it's
enormous um
and vital given
the
lawsuit,
uh
you'll read
there the problem statement. What I
want to point out from uh
Merritt's problem statement here
is that it's a fiveyear plan
to systemically improve student
outcomes through
an adaptive lens to special
education policy making,
grounded in community
voice, uh
staff and uh
your team does
feel that community voice
is essential in the work that we
do and um thinking
through policy
um as much
and equal to research
and the nexus of those two
is very important.
Uh We hope to provide a
roadmap for improved
outcomes
uh through more effective
provision of Special Ed services
in New Mexico. There's a number
of essential questions.
Merri is continuing to
ask, you'll
see that the output or
deliverable for you
is in two stages.
The first is a
presentation in
July.
Uh that is
based on a memorial
that actually didn't pass. It
was Senate Memorial 68.
It was Senator Lopez's
memorial a few years
back on restraint and
seclusion. It
was charged the uh
Development Disabilities
Council looking into
this and then reporting it to
the LES C
and while the memorial didn't
pass, the D DC,
did elect to
continue to do the work for
that um
Memorial.
Um They have asked
Merritt to participate and she
is participating. And so, and quite
of quite honestly supporting
them extensively in
that work. So we will
present that to you in terms of
findings for that memorial.
And then the long
term presentation will be in
um also in July around
considerations for her,
the five year
plan.
The next slide
is the first slide
around program
evaluation and
this is a little bit of a change
for staff.
Uh program
evaluation
involves some pretty
heavy
quantitative
analysis that we
will be doing this year.
Um We've made
a staffing move to
um bring on another staff
member so that uh we'll
be taking over
some of what Tim used to do in
terms of infrastructure, allowing
TIMS to support the team.
And we're growing our skills as a team
in terms of quantitative analysis,
that way we can provide our own
program evaluation for
you on the investments that you've
made uh as a as a
legislature,
literacy and
structured literacy in
particular may
be the
most important
major investment that the
legislature has made over the
past five years,
over $70 million
has gone into this
and that's a
wonderful and exciting
and thrilling thing.
It also behooves
us as your staff to
evaluate those
investments in a
meaningful way that gives you
the data. We are seeing
some anecdotal,
positive, amazing
trends. You heard some of that
from Belen this
morning, but
we want to actually have a
very good solid
evaluation for you
that looks at differences in
terms of
what's happened to the state at
large because of the general
letters training. What happens
with model schools,
what happens with schools
that are support schools
because there's different supports
or structures that are happening
um through the Public Education
Department,
Merritt uh is also
gonna look at what is happening
of the over the summer in terms
of the summer literacy
program. Uh that's
not on our work plan, but she's
gonna begin to look at it now
um and have a plan that
way she can then
produce something for
you over the next interim.
But by beginning to understand
what's happening now and plan for
that, uh the design
of that evaluation can be
much
stronger.
Um I just
want to say a word about program
evaluation in general
because you'll see a few of these and
I have highlighted them and read for
you on the slides as a
study committee, a legislative
education study committee
program evaluation
is
critical to how
you learn. What
about what you have invested in?
There is a fundamental
mechanism so that you
can continue
to
improve
policy
budget recommendations
uh and enables you to
be adaptive as a
legislature.
Annie
Armitage.
Uh
Annie has
three projects
that she's produced uh
going to produce for you
this interim and one actually
you will hear already on
Friday.
Um Oh, I
should note that me actually
has a project that is not
noted in here that she is
going to be
um producing for you
this afternoon
right after her. So
it's not noted on the work plan,
but that, that does
show or sort of exemplify
that we're trying to be very
responsive to other items
that come up. So we're limiting
projects to only a couple
for per analyst
because there are many
things that are coming up already
that um
we're hearing from various
legislators. So,
um for instance, what Merritt
will be presenting this afternoon
following my presentation
is a, a policy
brief and panel presentation
on youth suicide
prevention, which is
actually in response to consti
constituent from majority
leader, Senator Wirth.
Um and we really
wanted to honor that um
and be responsive to that
um request.
So we thought it was
important to bring in front of the LES
C.
The first item that you'll
hear about on Friday uh
from Annie is
on Principal Preparation
and this has been
uh something that you as a committee
have been looking at for two
years, at least this
is about leadership
as a, a vital
lever in moving
the needle in New Mexico
or um getting
to towards excellence, improving
our systems. Um
You also heard that from
Belen that I'd like to honor this
morning.
Um
You'll see the her
problem statement um
talks about
high quality principal preparation
programs, the
um research that's gone on
behind this for years.
Uh We also had a policy brief
from um I
think it was last year on
this, that's quite
extensive. Uh
We'd like to honor
some work that actually happened. You'll
hear on Friday where uh
Representative Garrett
went with Annie
um and with Sonny from
LFC as well as a few
others to visit
a program in Chicago
that was very promising.
Uh, that allows for some
models of what can
happen. Uh, you've
seen passed legislation
on this.
So the output
or deliver, deliverable
is actually fairly quick.
You'll hear the presentation
on Friday.
That's a panel presentation with
both Pe D and
Thornburg. And
then we're simply gonna,
um, revisit
this towards the end of the
interim in November with some
potential committee endorsed
legislation. Uh But
this is something you're very
familiar
with.
Uh the next item
that Annie will look
at our
teacher
supports.
And um this
is in response to house Memorial
20 around
class size.
Uh Once we
started looking at class size because
we've already begun our
work,
we noticed that class
size is actually simply
in response to
educators needing more
support or feeling like
they can do the job
that they are asked to
do. Uh class
size is actually simply
about that. Um
not simply but fundamentally
about that. And
um in
thinking through
that and
in um
in partnership
with Sunny at the
legislative finance committee
who is also wanting to
look at um
educator supports,
we thought that a partnership
would be really appropriate here.
So Sonny and Annie are going
to be uh presenting
a collaborative br brief
for both the LFC
and you all the LES
C um
which will
um address
teacher supports sort of
holistically providing some
options for you
that include class
size but also
allow you to look at class
size. Um In
addition to career
advancement opportunities,
innovative staffing
models, um
extra eas in
the class classroom,
and these are all important
considerations for you to
weigh um
not just against
each other, but in addition to
each other sort of side by
side, looking at cost
effectiveness, but also
what really supports excellence
in the classroom
um and actually supports
excellence in
in the workforce.
So the deliverable is
also fairly quick on this. You'll
be hearing this in June
um as well as the
LFC.
Uh Finally,
Annie Annie will be doing
a program evaluation as
well. Uh
This is the second
major investment I would say
on behalf of the legislature
and um other than
educator salaries,
um educator,
clinical practice has seen
uh million
dollars in
educator practice in
general, $33
million or teacher residency
programs. So it
does behoove us to
look at this in terms of
student outcomes,
other um metrics,
teacher recruit uh retention,
those types of things.
So, II, I do
want to point out her essential
questions here in
terms of, are there different
different teacher licensure
pathways and clinical
experiences associated
with different differences
in outcomes of new teacher
students?
In other words, if
you have a traditional teacher
going through a residency,
are those students gonna have different
outcomes from a
traditional teacher
going through student
teaching? Because you've made investments
in both of those.
Similarly
an alternative licensure
teacher going through a
residency versus an
alternative licensure
teacher who does
not and simply goes into a
traditional mentorship
program. Are there
differences in those student
outcomes? And that's
very important for you to
see as an
investment of the
legislature?
Ok,
Tim.
Uh again, Tim's
work has shifted, uh
which we are already
benefiting from and you'll hear
some of his work
tomorrow. A project
that's not listed
here is some work that
he's already done. That's
just amazing.
Uh You will be very excited
to see tomorrow and that is
helping us think through a
web page redesign for the
LES C. So it's more
user-friendly for uh
stakeholders as well as
yourself and
very excitingly,
a dashboard with
data for you all
that is comprehensive
that provides data in terms of
student outcomes,
graduation
budget. It,
it's um
really uh
pretty
dynamic. Uh It,
it's a dashboard one point.
Oh, so we plan to build
off of it. Uh But
what's even more incredible,
I'll brag on him just a little bit
is that he created
it in just a
month.
Um So
that's not recognized
here. But again, that's a project that
he has already started similar
to Annie and Merritt.
Um So
the first thing that Tim has
on uh
the docket for the
interim is a
program evaluation as
well. And this is learning
time again,
major investment on behalf
of the legislature
um
with the hopes that learning
time, extended learning time
in any of its versions
that have happened over the past five
years have an impact.
Um And
um we
had
already
organized
evaluation of this as of
last year prior
to and knowing
uh the um
beginning of House Bill
130 was going to
hit. Um I
think that no
matter what happens in
terms of um
impact on schools or districts
with the potential rule
um or
the changing
of the rule as it's supposed
to go into effect on July
1st. Uh I
think that our
evaluation will still be
very meaningful
uh in supporting you
all with adapted policy
making and really
understanding how to help
schools or districts take
advantage of programs
that do offer learning time
because there are students
who need
targeted specific
extra learning time.
That is no question.
Um I think it's
how do we unders
how do we support
you in terms of
um what could possibly
happen? I'm
gonna read his evaluation
questions here because I think that's
important for you in terms
in in getting
feedback. If you do have
feedback for
us.
His first question is how
and in what ways did
changes in learning time
affect student growth growth
in the 2324 school
year? So if there were
changes, you know
how and in what ways
did they impact student
growth? And
did schools make effective use
of the flexibility offered in the K
12 plus program?
Did flexibility result
in net positive or
net negative negative
impact.
Should the K 12 plus statute
be amended to create
additional guardrails to,
to guide pe D's implementation
in the program
are the resources and supports
provided to, to
schools adequate to
support effective implementation
of the K 12 plus
program.
Uh Mr Chairman Committee,
my favorite question
of the four questions that
Tim has developed
is the last
one
and in as your
staff and team
and as the
committee
reckons with
the impact of how
learning time and extended learning
time may impact our school
districts. I think it
really behooves us to
be objective
and think
through
how you best
support the districts
and the schools
where they need the resources
and the support that they
need them. So,
listening to our school
leaders and the
teachers, the educators in
terms of
these resources or supports
are critical are really
important
in understanding this entire
landscape.
Uh One thing that's
important here is that uh
the output or deliverable
will be in September.
Uh We'll
have some time between
now and then. Uh
I also think that it,
it's important to note that we will
have a joint hearing with LFC
in September. Uh
We plan to meet with
them on one of the days
and uh we will also
benefit from the good work
of sunny, I think in um
LFC as well
and their um um
examination of learning
time.
Thank
you.
The next item
um that Tim
will be looking at is data
governance.
Uh
We have heard and spoken
with the team that developed
the longitudinal data system
through the Higher Ed Department.
And it looks very
promising. It looks
like they've done an excellent
job
of working with the different
entities, state agencies.
So we'd really love to be
able to put uh
ask them to present
to you on
what they have done. You'll note
there on the deliverable that
the uh Tim
will be organizing a panel
presentation in June
and then in November presentation
and policy brief with considerations
for you on long
term vision around
data and data governance.
Um
So
data governance, we know
that schools are
struggling with issues
around data
and um you
have likely heard or, or
have heard, we know you have
heard that there's issues
in terms of data um
and project nova.
So part of this will be an update
around Project Nova and the status
of that um system for
the public education
Department.
But one of the elements around this
is actually this notion of
capacity
uh and
uh the capacity of
various state
agencies, not just the
public education department, but the
higher education department
EC CD to
actually build
another
state agency or
quasi agency, a
separate entity
that pulls
together
capacity so that it's not
so disparate
and can strengthen
and um uh
provide a
long term
um return on
investment if you will around
data for the
legislature for
policymakers, as well
as those different
data agencies.
Um We are
looking at different models you've
heard this before but Tim will
be providing a lot more research on
this and maybe um
having some people come and present
for you in terms of
models around like Tennessee,
Washington, California
that have these agencies that
their entire focus
is on
data um and
analysis.
And Natasha
Davalos,
Natasha's two projects
um are,
are the first is on
defining tribal education
sovereignty. This
is designed to be very
informational for you
and ground us all on some
understanding of
tribal education sovereignty
and, and um
what this actually
um signifies
for our tribal
education, our departments,
our partners um
in the work as well
as those that are serving
um tribal um
our pueblos,
our nations um across
the state that
um
partner with school
districts and charter schools.
She's got some pretty
heavy uh
essential questions
that I'll let you read
through. I think I'll just read
maybe the
first
two in
terms of how,
um how
much she's, how much work
she's sort of doing and provi
providing the policy brief
on what this means for
the state.
Um
She's traveled all
over
already. Uh She's
been everywhere from
uh Zuni to
I think Santa Clara last
week. So she's meeting with all
tribal education directors
um and others.
First question is
what are the fundamental
principles and practical
implications of tribal
education sovereignty,
particularly concerning
the rights of indigenous tribes to self
governance, cultural autonomy
and equitable access
to education across the
state.
And two, how does tribal
education sovereignty
intersect with broader issues
of educational policy,
jurisdictional authority and
community engagement. What are the
implications for addressing
historical inequities and
promoting culturally responsive
education for Native American
students?
Again, this is
designed to support
you as informational
policy um in
responding to the
lawsuit.
Um
I think that it's also
important as a follow
up in a sense to
the work around school
boards and the jus
jurisdictional
relationships that happen
between tribal entities and
governments and school boards. In
particular,
the second project
that Natasha will be working on is
the status of homeless and foster
students. Uh
She's already mett with the
public Education department. They've
been wonderful um
in um
talking through uh what
actually happens and their support
with the pub uh uh
districts and charter schools
across New Mexico.
Um Kinny Vento
understanding this, this
is a really
responding to a very timely
issue that we're seeing happening
across the state with this
increase in rise and
um homeless
or unhoused students.
And um really a, a
sharp focus that needs
to happen long time coming
on foster students
as those that have the
most egregious
metrics in the
system.
Daniel has
two projects that
will support his
work in finance
that are are not the SCG
revision. We'll talk about that
last, I'm
gonna
quickly hit on the first one.
Talk a little bit more about the second
one. We've already done
something on family income index.
We're gonna revisit it again, because
we have some student outcomes this
year um
to be able to look at student
outcomes as they relate to
family income
index. And
then the second is cash
balances.
So this is
interesting, we'd like to go
ahead and dig into this a little bit.
Um You'll note there, I'm gonna
actually just read
Daniel's first
sentence in his problem
statement. Uh
There's a perception
among some stakeholders in New
Mexico that the amount of cash
balances held by
school districts and charter schools may
be considered excessive,
particularly in relation to
the legislature's annual appropriation
to the state equalization
guarantee.
Some local education
agencies or leas have
suggested their growing cash
balances may be attributed to
various challenges
associated with the Pe D's
reimbursement process
as well as the general need to have
funds on hand for capital
outlay projects
as a related component
of the, of the Les
CS simultaneous revision
of the SCG
staff, namely
Daniel will
collaborate with exter
external stakeholders in
assessing the root
causes of some growing
cash balances. And
whether particular processes of
PD in the capital
outlay process are con
contributing to the growth of these
cash balances or
whether there should be recommended
thresholds.
I I think it's important
that we actually bring this topic
to light for the legislature
dig in and understand this in
partnership with the superintendents
in particular.
Um so that
we have their assistance
and, and deeply understanding
this. But I also
want to say here that
um you
heard
that and I have
heard broadly from
many school districts, they're having
to tap into their cash
balances
this year.
And I,
I want to make that point
very succinctly
in response to how we
will approach this
because cash
balances
as you're seeing this year
are, are, are, are
not something that we
need to just I think
have assumptions
around
Jessica Hathaway
also has two
projects.
Um
You will hear this
on Friday
uh to begin
with, this is gonna be a
long term project
um at least over this interim,
if not longer depending on what
we find. Um
But she's gonna begin on
Friday with a land
review of Middle school research,
National Research as well as what
we know about students at this
grade level.
Um This is in
response to the memorial
and uh we're very
excited about this work.
Uh We have many,
many stakeholders,
superintendents, principals
across the state who are wanting to work
with us on this. And
we um
one, yeah, it's one of the most
exciting projects this
year.
Um She
also is embarking on a program
evaluation that's very
technical.
Um This
is Jessica's project with
Harvard and then the Strategic
Data Project.
Uh She, it's a
twoyear endeavor
here. So she's
digging in, she's in
by July. You will have a
report on student
outcomes as they're related to career
technical education
funding. Uh
She's gonna be looking
at an analysis
where she's looking side by
side at student outcomes of
programs that have leveraged
CTE dollars and
those that have not.
And um those
include sort of graduation rates,
student achievement,
traditional metrics.
And then she's going to from
there expand on
student outcomes and what
we hope in terms of career technical
education.
Um
This has been really
wonderful and working with Harvard
and uh I encourage you to
just check in with her about
this because it's a really
meaningful project for us. And
we will be reaching out to
you to see if you
um uh
want to be part of this
process in a little bit more of an
in-depth way we
are seeking member input
um and conti as
we continue to look
at what we
identify as student outcomes
other than just
traditional achievement
metrics,
Connor Hicks,
you'll hear about more in my
director's report tomorrow. He's one
of our two new analysts.
Um
Connor is wonderfully
taking on our
education support
services and
he has two projects.
The first is the stem innovation
network. We would like to really
honor Senator Pope
here and
uplift some legislation
that um he
has um
been um
uplifting the past couple
of years. So this is something
that we're going to take on as a very
um uh central part of the
work plan this year,
Connor has been
incredible
already. Uh, he
has talked with
Ohio and
Tennessee,
um, national partners
around instead of innovation
models. He has talked
with partners all over the state
already met with them various
times. Um,
we're really
excited about this work
and having something for you all in
terms of a viable,
um, um, committee
endorsed legislation when we
get to November.
Um, he's met with N MS
U. Yeah,
he's,
he's been very um
a
go-getter.
Um
Connor also is looking at
universal school meals.
Um
We know we need to look at
this in terms of sustainable
long term funding as
a primary issue, but
also in terms of
what's happening with the other
components of the
legislation,
um uh
food quality,
all of those other aspects.
Uh You saw that a rule
came out from the public education
department in our activity
report. We'll be talking
about that tomorrow.
Um This proposed
rule. Um
But some of his essential
questions here are really uh
vital in terms
of uh which
schools and districts
offer free meals, which do
not, how many are designated
as standard program, schools
versus uh community
eligibility program
schools. This is pretty
technical, but
he's diving into the weeds
here to think about eligibility
and how much return.
Um how cost-effective
this is for the state
now that you have mandated
this.
So
how do we support both the public
education department as well as the
districts and schoolss and, and,
and, and having the
correct amount of money
um and leveraging federal
dollars to the maximum
benefit.
Mark Montoya is our
latest policy analyst
again. I'll talk about him tomorrow
during the director's report, but
he is um been
amazing. Um
wonderful addition to the
team he's taking
on capital outlay
transportation um
and has learned very
quickly from Tim.
Tim's been a great mentor
for him so far. But
um Mark
um comes from the Mexico
Finance Authority. So he has
a great background um
in things around
capital L A but also
finance. He's, he's a,
he's been a great member for the
team.
Um So the first thing
he is looking at
is school board
member, training and finance
reporting. This is a follow
up that we will produce for
you of um
Senate Bill 157.
You heard about it a little bit this
morning as well.
Um We're excited to just
follow up for you and
understand how training
um is being
recorded gathered
posted. Um
What training is like
and how it's provided
um how
school superintendents are addressing
and meeting the requirements of
webcasting.
Um I want to
dig into the nuances of this a
little bit. So to better understand
and provide information from
you and hear from
stakeholders about
the
implementation.
Uh Mark is also looking
into broadband and
education technology. We
haven't visited this
for a few years and
I think it's important that we understand
the landscape of how
much of the
state um the
districts and charter schools currently
have broadband
access. Um
If there are gaps,
uh what is the state
education network uh
sta status of the
S um how
are districts
um that do not
have broadband or,
or struggling with
broadband
coping and what's being done
to support them? And
how is pe d providing support
to educators in particular
to ensure effective utilization
of technology for instructional
purposes. Uh This
will be in November
um because there's quite a bit of work
actually to dig into
here,
John has an
assignment this
interim.
Uh
We've seen legislation over
the past few years
on
um
uh
going back to
a school board,
um a state
superintendent of
education,
what I think the
staff uh would
like to do
is
think deeply
about the current
system,
what is working and what is
not,
what form a new governing
body might take.
Um not necessarily
going back to something that already
existed, but something
that could be for the state of New
Mexico
beneficial
um in the long
term,
um how that relates
to a long term plan and
vision for the
state,
what resources a new governing
body would need
to be successful
and how if
at all would a new governance structure
affect the operations of the
public education department? Because
going into legislation for
this behooves us,
it behooves us to understand
all of what that would mean for the
public education department and the
impact and time. Uh
it would mean uh or
involve
14
projects,
Solutions for
Mathematics.
Um I have to say here,
we have two amazing
partners in this space.
The first is a public education
department. They've been fabulous
partners in this work and are
already doing quite a bit
in mathematics.
Uh We have
a wonderful uh
bureau of
Mathematics and Science
and Math at Public Education
Department. Um They're doing
great work in terms of uh high
school mathematics pathways
and working with the Da
Center. Uh
just kudos
really to that
um team and to the
Public Education Department there
and um providing
um actually good partnership
for us, really great
partnership
um as well as the
College Career Readiness
Bureau. Um
but Jessica and Merritt
will be working on this
and the second partner
here that has been really
wonderful and instrumental for
um in providing feedback
for us. And thought partnership
is in New Mexico Partnership for
Math and science education.
And they've been a longstanding
entity for over
20 years in the
state. I think over
30 years, actually,
that uh really
supports public education
and thought partnership around this
and they have come and met
with us. I don't
know how many times now
they've asked us to go visit with them.
They've been really great thought partners.
So just
and Merritt are taking on some
solutions for you on your
behalf to prevent present some
policy
considerations
uh school
safety, Connor,
Merritt Natasha and
Mark are working on this.
This is a broad
team because school
safety um
can and does mean everything
from socio emotional well-being
to the school safety
structures in place
at a school capital outlay.
Um This is a two
pronged endeavor. The
first deliverable
will come in June with a landscape
analysis of what's actually happening
in the space across the
state. Uh What
data do we have around
all things uh in
terms of school safety
and um behavioral
metrics, um
uh what is happening in terms
of the dollars that went through capital
outlay to support this.
So they'll present to you
um actually some
good core initial
data. The second
presentation will be in November
with some next steps and policy
considerations for you
all after they've
also done continued
work um uh in partnering
with uh stakeholders, school
districts, uh
superintendents, uh
hopefully, you know, with the
representative baca and continued
support in terms of the school
safety uh summits
to really think through what are
next steps for you all to consider
as a
legislature.
Third team project
is addressing attendance and this
is Jessica and Tim
um
are data
duo.
Um
chronic absenteeism
may be uh
the most pressing
issue for school districts
right now and
um we
can't lose our sight on how
to address this. And
um so all that we can do as
a staff to support you in
this space. We're trying
to do LFC is
currently um
um pursuing
a program evaluation in this as
well and have asked
for our support. So
Jessica and Tim
have produced some incredible
analysis already
um that they're
going to support the
LFC presentation
in, in June. So LFC will be
presenting to their communi committee
in June, but
uh our
um work
is actually boing off
of that. Uh
And they will be
looking at some predictive
models that
have not been approached so
far in terms of student
attendance, they're going
to look to try to identify
potential mechanisms
that better target
funds that
will then reduce chronic
absenteeism.
So we have a pretty
wonderful um
um piece of
statue, The Tenants for
Success Act and it's very
detailed in
tiers. But
what doesn't happen are
systematic uh
collection of
data in a way that's
really um detailed
and process oriented and
understood widely across all
different districts and charter
schools. We also
don't have targeted
ways of understanding the
various reasons that
students are missing schools
and how to then
connect better supports
for those variety of
reasons. And that's the
complexity of attendance is that
there are so many reasons
out there that students are
missing, including
not wanting to be
in school because it's
not friendly for them
or meaningful.
And if you have that on one
hand and transportation on the
other, the variety of
reasons for that
behooves us to better understand
how to target funds and
understand those reasons and
track and have a data
mechanism that allows for
schools to be responsive towards
that
last.
And definitely not
least we have the vision
vision of our state equalization
guarantee, which may be
um
the most
important thing that we do this
year. Um
So it's all on
Daniel's shoulders.
It's just
kidding.
Uh
I have there that the team
members are Daniel,
the entire team.
Um All of us as well
as LFC as our
good partners in the
work. And
um
there's gonna be a few things
that Daniel looks at in terms
of the SCG. Uh we,
we have a wonderful state
equalization guarantee. It's a
beautiful
mechanism to,
to look at equity and
funding and it's been heralded
for several years now.
There are aspects
of it that we can
um improve
on and hope to do
so. And that's something
that should happen every 10
years according to research.
So this is a good thing that we're doing
this. Um While
also not throwing the baby
out with the bathwater,
you'll note on the
thick work
plan that all
of this other work
supports Dan, this work
that Daniel is leading
for us in terms of the state
equalization guarantee,
whether that's class
size to
CTE
to school safety
because they all will
impact how we
begin to look at the state equalization
guarantee, not just
in terms of the division problem,
that is the state equalization
guarantee and the actual funding
formula, but the top
line number
that then goes to support
that.
Um That is why
we hoped that the presentation
from the State Investment Council
and the land office this morning
would provide a foundation for
you as we embark on this
work. Uh This
interim.
Um We also hope
that that,
that presentation
allows you to think through the
SCG and
funding. Um
Considering thinking
along the lines of multiyear
funding, as you heard from
Daniel, but
long term projections,
how do we as a staff
better support you
around things like
uh salary
raises
and projecting those
out for several years,
not just the next year, not
just the next two years, but
how that impacts
the actual workforce and growth
of the workforce in New
Mexico.
Um We just hope to
better position you in
making those decisions
um for
the state. So
and the students and
staff that support
um the students in New
Mexico with
that Mr Chairman, I'll stand
for questions.
>> Alright. So first on my list
is represent
Vodka.
>> Thank you Mr Chairman.
And I will be brief and
it's really not questions
but more make sure that we
highlight within your activity.
So I'm not going to sign more work
with just some areas. So if you will,
Mr Chairman and uh
director parea ornament
one, thank you for the middle
school study because
many of the issues that we have at our high
school level have their origins
and roots in middle
school,
whether it be academic, performance,
attendance, graduation rates, all
of those things, even the
social emotional, even
our as we'll talk about later,
our suicide, our
SCL stuff.
Um my two
hardest years and uh my 31
years in education was I was a
middle school teacher and a middle school
administrator. So I, I
definitely like to Thank you for
that Mr
Chairman. The other thing is with the
SCG with
the review, I also want to unders
understand and part of what we
look at is the flow
of money. So when we get the money
to, to, to
ped how
is the money flowed out there in, in
terms of grants, in terms of
title one idea
B uh in
terms of, you know, as far
as reimbursements, right? Because that's one
of the, one of the issues that we're
hearing is as of,
I think Monday,
many districts hadn't received
their idea
allocation.
Um Mr Chairman, the other thing
about and this is for Tim the,
the data guy
when we talk about data and I sit on the
LFC and they talk about
data. It's just this big huge
group of numbers and I have requests
for the last two years to be broken down
by bands as far
as what it be K
two, you know, three through six
middle school,
not not for accountability,
but for this group to make
recommendations of
where the money and the support
and resources need to be.
So I think that's an important piece of
that just like
we said before. Um
the guys and many of the folks on
LFC, um
they're interested in the numbers, but
really, it's the story behind the numbers that
I think this group has to take a look
at
um
along with the
um
with the, with the
data also the school
designations as far as
that and how are they supported? How are they
funded? Because one of the things that I
think that we've done
is we have unfunded mandates,
we have requirements, we have things that
are, are tied
to this data, but
they're not adequately
funded.
Um And I think this is for
Merritt. Merritt talked about some of
these uh Mr
Chairman, she talked about, you
know, special education, but one of the
biggest growing needs of
school districts is our SAT
process and our
MLS S and so that's,
it kind of goes together because
when I was asking about
this, I think the
referrals in my district
increase fivefold
from, you know, 100 to over
600. So that's
a huge number of stats that we're
doing. And that again feeds
into a lot of this.
Um
One of the things Mr Chairman is
also the at risk and Fine Arts
Index. Ok. That was something that
we carried a couple years ago.
How is that impacted? And is that
still because I, I, one of the things I've
heard is that we've cut the at
risk index and if it
did we have,
I'm not sure why that was impacted
in the SCG
um with school
boards, uh I guess with governments
and I don't know who that was. I
apologize, Mr Montoya.
Um One of the
things about it is the accountability
of school board
who oversees them
what if they don't comply? And
the fact about it is I do think
is that if there is a
school board member and many of them are
just tremendously
amazing people,
but rather than remove an entire school
board, what happens for that individual school
board who may be
going outside of their
lane?
And finally, Mr Chairman,
um regarding the
attendance, ok, one of the
things that I want is
look about is the level of
engagement, ok?
Um level, as
far as our opportunities and
offerings of CTE
of other work types
experiences,
my, my, my belief,
my hypothesis is
that the more that a student
is involved in
activities, I I would like to
see attendance of those students
are involved and whether it be band or
choir, you
know, as far as ag
athletics, what is
their attendant looks like in comparison
to those who are not? And if there are students
who are not engaged for another activity
where they don't fit in, we need to
find something for those folks to fit
in and that they get involved
in because I do believe
and it has been said many times,
if a student makes a connection
with one adult in the building,
that student has a greater chance
of success. And so if we
whether if we haven't funded it before,
we need to put money
into those to make sure
opportunities exist for
students to get engaged.
Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Thank you, Senator
Souls.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
What a wonderful presentation.
Incredible team that you've put
together and stuff. I think we're,
we're very fortunate. Thank you all
for, for working
for us. And more importantly, the
kids and schools in, in New
Mexico. A couple
of questions and this might be
for Annie first
is, are we
going to be having serious
discussions about
teacher administrative
preparation? Uh
Recently I talked
with somebody who's in the
administrative uh
education program in New
Mexico State and
asked and they've
never discussed community schools
in all of our preparation
programs. They've never discussed
Ace's trauma informed
education nor
structured literacy. They
aren't even discussing that in
their preparation.
How are we going to move
forward in those critical areas
when that's not part of those programs?
And so I'm hoping that
we have them here in
front of us at some point
where we can ask those.
Uh and that's at New Mexico
State. Uh Things I hear
is eastern western
Highlands are a little more nimble
at moving into some of these new
areas. But
is that part of the, the
plan?
>> Yeah, Mr Chair, Senator
Souls. Um That's
really great and important
question we're gonna
have on Friday actually.
Um We'll have Michael Weinberg from
Thorn, the Thornberg Foundation as
well as CB Belek
from PE D. They've
both been a
pretty
heavily involved in a
community of practice among
educator preparation programs
around principal preparation.
There's been a lot of discussion
um including drafted
legislation in the last session
about how can we tighten
up those programs and better align
them with state and national
best practices.
So, um you
will have an opportunity to ask
questions of them. They've been really
heavily involved with the EP
PS in in evaluating
that. Um
And we would like the
opportunity to bring, I think
EP PS in front
of you so that you could directly
ask them as well.
>> Yeah, Mr Chairman, I
briefly um just
say that uh again
that this request from you, if this
is a request, we can definitely
do that be responsive and
also put together a memorandum
um for you in terms
of what,
what exactly is the program of
study and the
variety of EPPS
across the state? Because I think
that's at the heart of
it.
>> Thank you and, and Mr
Chair uh
and Annie
Gwen. Uh
another concern is
so many of our
teachers are not
getting structured literacy as part
of their teacher preparation
programs. And one of our
largest teacher preparation programs
is CNM, which is
90%
online.
We're spending a lot of money. It seems
like retrofitting what
should be part of the basic
program.
So it's kind of the same
thing just very much a concern
about what's
considered kind of modern teacher
preparation practices.
Are those happening for
the programs that are preparing most
of our teachers?
>> Yeah, Mr Mr
Chairman
and Mr Vice Vice
Chair of Souls.
So the Public Education Department
did put out a memorandum
um a few months
ago now that um
required ed prep
programs to
um include structured
literacy in their program of
study. That being
said, I'm not sure that we
have another, a
newer um
landscape analysis or
review of how much
that is actually happening other
than the NCTQ um
review that we had and
presented for you last interim,
which I think was very
enlightening and actually
provided some good momentum
for some prep
programs to actually
change. Um
So we can again
sort of do that review.
I also would say that
um you can
leave it to the public
education department and the
PPSC to sort of
shepherd that
change to happen over
time since that is at the
purview of the public
education department to
mandate programs of
study or approve
them for pro
programs.
You can also consider legislation
and we can support you with thinking through
things uh along
those lines.
>> Thank you and Mr
Chair and kind of different
areas and this may be more
merit and I don't know
if it's a direct question.
Uh but
we for many years have talked
about needing to expand
more into early
childhood education
and then also into higher
education.
Uh so much
of the problems,
issues and concerns in
education and our
student outcomes have nothing
to do with education. Uh
It has to do with
prenatal care, early
childhood education, not
just childcare,
uh all kinds of community
things that absolutely
affected and
you know, and how do we move
into those, they
somewhat have been under the purview
of the um
health and public health
and human services
areas and things, but
they absolutely affect what we do
in education effectively.
And the same thing, the higher
education I'd like to see
some continued discussion
about potential
legislation that expands the
scope of this committee
to go clear down into
prenatal because it
affects it so
importantly. But
then also the outcomes into
higher education and
some of the government structures and what's
going on with higher ed.
Uh because
as we get into high school
now, career, technical
education, absol and dual
credit. Absolutely blends
with higher education as part
and or the secondary
level. They are one and the
same through
grades 11 through
16.
Thank you. That's all. Thank you, Mr
Chair
represent
Garrett.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you, uh
Executive director Gwen
and everybody. Um
just going off of
what Senator Soul said, I would just
say that in all
these areas having people from
colleges of education,
appropriate people
included, which probably
you're already thinking of. But
I just want to make sure
um something that we talked
about um
Mr Chairman, when
we were looking at the new section
nine with all the expendable
trust monies, the
original text said
that or the
original intent
for House appropriations
was that any
category affecting
education
would have an LFC
analyst, ad FA
analyst and
an LES C
analyst when it
pertained to education.
So that's
something
that I think needs to be looked
into. I don't know exactly
how, but,
but I just think that's important
because that's often missing
when we in
LFC and
Mr Lou is
terrific.
Um It's, it's not a
reflection on the analyst from
those organizations. It's just
that the vital
piece of the deep dives
all of you are making is often
missing. So I just want to make that
point
um
on the special
education, something
that I don't see
is and, and maybe
this is already being done.
I think this is merits
area
is
special education
students, students with a disability is a
very broad
category.
And what I never see is
what do special education
outcomes actually look
like, like
all the sped students
except for the ones with the
most profound disabilities,
take our tests
and then their scores are
included. I mean,
I always tell the story of the
eighth grader special
education student. I was trying to
figure out how to fit
algebra two in her schedule and
she couldn't add and subtract.
So I just feel
like it's
not a matter of lowering
anybody's
expectations,
but I just think we
don't hear about
that. So that's
just I'd like
to see a little bit more
realism.
Um
And then um let's
see,
Senator Soul said some of the
things I had,
oh, this
might be part of the consideration
Mr Chair. But on
universal school
meals
there there's an element of cultural
responsiveness to
menus. I always
remember when they
uh implemented
um whole wheat
tortillas
and the lack
of response those tortillas
got, you've never seen so many
tortillas thrown away.
But I just think we have
to be culturally sensitive.
You know, if, if you start getting these
mandates for what's gonna be in
the food. And then
our fifth graders did studies
on the sugar content
of the foods that
came with the mandated breakfast
program. So I just
don't want to forget
the diversity of New Mexico
from tribal
to Hispanic
uh to everything when
we look at school. So we
don't end up mandating things
that people don't eat.
Um Mr
Chair school governance,
I want to make sure that
studies done of other states
like Rhode Island, their,
their state Board of Education
oversees uh
K through 20
they actually oversee
college. The broadband
person who's in charge
of some
universal broadband thing is
also the chair of the Board
of Education. So
I love the fact that
we talked about
new forms, not just
are we gonna have a secretary
or a state Board of Education
that nobody even knows who they
are?
Um
So that
um again,
uh Mr Chair Solutions
for Math.
Again, that's an area to
include in the teacher prep.
I it's been said before. Too
many things. In fact, Senator
Soul said it too many things we're
looking at teachers.
Uh when I did my teacher prep
program. It was an unpaid
teacher residency program.
We had one
not very good course
in math. I
studied calculus. I'm
not afraid of math, but
so many elementary
teachers become elementary
teachers because
math was not their thing.
So I just,
we, we can't
overlook the teacher
prep programs. And
then what I didn't
see,
um, two things
um when
salaries and, and this
might come under the
scg
the competing
forces
of the impact of
the incredibly
high raises of insurance
costs. We give a
3% raise and
then like there's a 6%
insurance cost. So
just making sure that we
address that and
then state testing, I was
a state uh
uh
test coordinator for years. I'm
kind of out of the loop. Now, I
don't even know what's required,
but looking, um,
the PE D said
they were gonna determine if you're gonna
have a four day school
a week based on
test scores that haven't been
released or
not officially released.
And um, looking at
that
state testing, I don't know if
there was talk about
replacing it with the beginning
of the year, middle of the year, end of the year
model. I don't know
where we stand,
but I feel like
I, I wanna is that, is
anybody looking at
that? I don't
know, I didn't hear
it but
just
yeah, that's
it.
Thank you
>> all represent
Figueroa.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Many of my
questions and thoughts have
been
expressed,
but thank you for this
ambitious plan. We'll just
go quickly page by
page merit special
education.
Um
I think there's some crossover
there with Annie's teacher
supports that might need to
happen in that discussion
in terms of student outcomes
and teacher retention and
recruitment.
Um
special ed requirements
and needs are gonna be really
different and they're going to play
into the outcomes we
want and how we fund
them.
Um
Merritt also is doing the
program evaluation on
literacy and just the timeline
in here says a
draft bill or budget
proposal will be
in December.
And my only comment there is
that's a little late if we want to
get something substantial
in the budget around
literacy,
which is super important
and I would reiterate
the Senator's comment
about higher education
institutions and
where this training
fits and
ask that we consider
both the alternative
pathways for
both principal and
teacher licensure
as well as the traditional
because some items are
included in each, not
both.
Um
and Annie's teacher
support.
If we are
broadening the
investigation into
class size to
look at teacher
supports in general,
then I think we have to look
at mentoring and
support particularly
for the first five years
of new teachers.
That's gotta be in the
mix.
I'm excited
about getting
some more data on
residencies and the clinical
practice options
because we have been directing
a lot of funds that way
and it will be nice
to see if we're getting
results
um with
respect to Tim's learning
time.
Don't forget if
you can include
the summer and outside
class time learning,
who's evaluating those
programs and what are the
results we're
getting
because that is also
in our
budget
and I think I'll leave it there, Mr
Chair if that's
enough except
to say the SCG
is going to be super
important and I look
forward to that
work.
Thank you,
>> me of
oil.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you um
director. Um
I'm excited
to hear about these uh
issues because
many of them um
uh many of my colleagues
have, have uh highlighted a lot
of the, the same concerns I
have. I'm gonna just
kind of touch on a couple of
them the,
and, and I think both of them kind
of are Annie's, uh,
um, uh,
responsibilities but the
teacher supports, um,
definitely the class sizes. I've had
a lot of opinions on, on, on
class sizes and, and on
both sides. Um,
as a teacher, I would love a smaller
class size but then
we would need more teachers and we don't
have enough and then
it's a very real thing
that some districts,
if we mandated this
don't have classrooms
for six more
teachers. Um
And so if we can make sure that
we, that those structural
issues, I mean, that, that, that's a real
issue. There's, there's many schools
in my district that if we had to
add six teachers,
we don't have six classrooms.
Um So uh
so what do we do there?
And, and um, and I love
the fact that what your,
your hope is or
your, your scope is, is
you're looking at the whole
issue. What else,
what else can we do? Can we put
eas in there? Can we do
you know, can we um
team teacher something like
that if we need a new teacher, maybe
it's a team teaching instead of a
classroom. So something like
there, there has to be some
ways to remedy this.
That is not just, hey, you
need six new classrooms
and good luck finding
six new teachers
because so
um the other thing
is um
I am very interested
and excited to hear about
how you are going to be
focusing on um
how the different outcomes for
the different licensure path
pathways. Um I
am an alternative
licenser uh
um teacher,
so I never
thought I would be a teacher in my
entire life until 11
years ago and now I'll never leave it.
So, but uh but
I did not, I
came in not knowing
any education lingo
whatsoever.
Um And luckily
I taught um
in a, in a subject where it
was gracious to, to, to
that. But uh so I,
I'm, I'm anxious to see that.
I'm anxious to see what's going
on and, and um
like uh Representative
Figueroa said that
um new
teacher supports,
I've noticed it
even just in my
school. Um
The ones that we
get a lot of turnover are
those that are in the first five years,
some of them, even in the first, not even
finishing, especially alternative
life insurance. They don't even
finish that
because they get so frustrated
with um
with uh just the lack.
So it may be maybe not
only the, the, the district
teacher mentorship, but a school
teacher mentor, like pair them up with
the, with the, with the master teacher there
something and, and those
kind of things because I
think the more support
that brand new teachers
have and a lot
of it has to do with
not so much the teaching
part because they know their
content. It is
all the other stuff
that we have that, that teachers have to
deal with that is that
gets overwhelming and not worth it
for them. Um So
that's what I would love to keep them
because they had a desire at
one point in time and I hate
to constantly be losing
them. But thank
you.
>> Thank you. Any other questions
for members?
All right. Oh,
Senator,
>> thank you. Um,
so II I met
with the, my district
actually last week
and you know, one of the things that was
brought up in Rear Rancho
is with several other districts
always struggling. Um
But as we're looking at the SCG,
has there been any thought
given to
a baseline,
you know, that it costs this much
per student
and at the base
level and then we add the
additional things. Has
there been any thought to that?
>> Yeah, Mr Chairman
and um Senator
Bryant. Yeah, great question.
And yes, that's actually where
we're beginning.
Um So
Daniel has already,
we've started to do some deep
projections and scenarios
because anything that we
any adjustment we make will
have an impact on the
seg.
Um But we think that
starting with the baseline
of um what basic
program means
um both at the
elementary level and then the
secondary and this
includes the CTE factor
in terms of secondary.
Um that is sort of
fundamental and the first
thing that we're thinking
about around the
SCG revision, the
second is
at risk. Um
and that is we have increased
the at risk fund. Um
The at risk factor over the
past few years, quite substantially
since it um first
came into inception since I think
97 or something like that.
Um But there's movement
for districts in the uh around
at risk based on this
three year average around
them. Uh One thing that we
are noticing in our own projections
is Daniel and Tim are doing
this are looking at
putting the family
income index
as the actual
tool or mechanism
for identifying
um at risk um
for school districts.
And that might be a better indicator of
poverty, it goes above
100% poverty
threshold. So it supports
schools and districts a little bit
better. Um
But to better
to, to sort of synthesize and answer
question quickly. Yes,
the basic program is the very first
thing we're looking at >> and then
still as part of the SCG
Mr chairman and
director.
Um
we do we have any legislators
on this or is it just the LFC
staff working with the LES C
staff? And, and I don't have
any opinion either way, but I'm just
wondering
>> certainly um
Mr Chairman and Senator
Brandt, it's our staff right
now. But the idea or hope
is that we then bring it to you
for input.
Um um
uh We would like to meet with
you
um offline, not
necessarily just in a
formal hearing or meeting
like this, but actually get your
input as we move
through and go through each
stage. So we'll be
calling on you. You're
definitely one of the ones that we want to
get input from, particularly
around CTE and the secondary
factor. But, um,
we, we'd like to reach out
to any and all of you who
are interested.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman
and, and I think that's
important because obviously
the staff can buy in
but, and it's really
ultimately up to us in the end
and you know, LFC can be a little
bit of a trouble. So if Sunny
gives you any problems, let me
know. Thank you,
Mr
>> Mhm.
What else?
Ok. Um I
just want to say thank you.
Um I'm really
looking forward to this next
interim as I have for
the past couple of
interims because I think
that um what
you director and, and
our staff here have really proven
is is to really work
closely with all stakeholders in
education um to
come up with real and
true policy solutions
that um I think we even
heard today in our initial
presentations are, are
very well regarded.
Um And so
I'm really looking forward to
um the issues that
we have on the agenda for this year
because I think all these
are things that we're hearing from our
constituents. Um
and, and all of the stakeholders
around the state and to
really be able to get their buy-in
and their input and to work
with you all on, on what the
solutions are gonna be, is,
is super important.
Um And then I'll reiterate
the fact that, you know, I
think um we
all here at Les C have
that long term vision,
you know, what are we doing in the short
term? And then
um looking at,
you know, what do we hope to achieve
in the long term is,
is um
super important for our
students or educators around
the state because
um I think there's
almost this conception
around um
New Mexico that we're
kind of
um
having temporary solutions
or don't know necessarily where we're going
with education.
Um But we do
and it's right here, I think, and
it's spearheaded right here
at the Les C. And so thank
you all for your work and I look
forward to working with you all in the interim.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Chair. I
will say that we
need a motion
in a second for our
adoption of our work
plan.
All right.
So I'll give the second
because I heard Senator Brand.
Um is there any opposition
to adopting the work plan?
All
right,
if you want to include that in
your motion? All right,
and you're ok with seconding that? All
right. So for the schedule,
as well as the adoption
of the work plan
All right, seeing no
objection. We have
a work plan. We have an agenda.
All thank you. All
thank you
director.
All,
all right. So we'll go to our
next agenda
item,
youth suicide
prevention
six.
Oh, you're
right.
I got it. I got it right
here.
Ok.
All right, Merritt.
>> Hi, good afternoon, Mr
chairman, members of the
committee. My name
is Merrit Andrews and I'm
your senior policy
analyst.
I'm here today alongside
this panel of experts
to discuss youth suicide
prevention.
If you turn to tab five
in your binders, you will see
my brief titled
Youth Suicide Prevention.
I will begin by providing
a high level overview of
this brief to provide some context
for this presentation and
then I will turn it over to the Public
Education Department, followed
by Belin consolidated
schools and then followed
by Albuquerque public
schools.
Suicide and suicidal
behavior is a growing
public health crisis
in New Mexico and the
United States.
In 2023
the Federal Centers for Disease
Control reported that
from 2007 through
2021
suicide rates for
people aged 10 through
24 increased
by
62%
in New Mexico. The
Public Education Department
reports that in
2019, our
state led the nation
in suicide rates among
youth between 10
to 17 years old
with suicide being the
second leading cause of
death in New Mexico
among that age
group.
While the triggers for
suicide are complex.
It is also often
preventable
adults working with
youth in school settings,
families,
peers can play a
critical role in
identifying and supporting
youth at risk for
suicide.
New Mexico uses the youth
risk and resiliency
survey and M years
to assess the health risk
behaviors and
resiliency of New
Mexico middle and high school
students through a
survey administered to a
selection of schools in each
school district. In the fall of
odd numbered years.
The NM year system
is part of the National
CDC Youth Risk
Behavior Surveillance
System. The
CDC released its
most recent
youth risk behavior
survey data summary
trends report in
2023 which
provides key data trends
from 2011 to
2021.
The report shows
nearly all indicators
of poor mental health and
suicidal behavior
increased during that
time period.
If you turn to page two,
you will see two
graphs.
These two graphs are using
data from that most recent
CDC report to
illustrate the
increases in suicidal
behavior were not
evenly distributed among
high school students.
The first graph entitled
percentage of us high school
students who seriously
considered attempting suicide
by gender and sexual identity
in 2021 shows
that high school L GB
Q plus students
were most likely
to consider attempting suicide
at 45%
compared with 22%
of all students.
The second graph entitled
percentage of us high school
students who seriously considered
attempting suicide by race and
ethnicity. In 2021
shows that Native American
students were most likely to
consider attempting suicide
at
27%.
While there are many causes
of suicide, certain
behavioral issues can
heighten risk.
Moving to page three.
You will see a graphic illustrating
how individual factors
can contribute to risk
of and prevent against
suicide. For
example, adverse childhood
experiences, aces
defined as 10 potentially
traumatic experiences that
fall in the categories of
abuse, neglect and
other household challenges
that occur before a child reaches
their 18th birthday
may lead to
increased suicidality
and suicide attempts in
adulthood.
In New Mexico, the
prevalence of Children with
one or more aces
significantly outpaces
the nation as data
shows 49%
of Children in New Mexico
have at least one ace
compared with
39.8%
of Children nationally.
However, research
suggests early interventions
can mitigate long
term consequences of
trauma.
Moving to page four,
I am going to touch on New Mexico's
approach to youth suicide
prevention which
subsequent presenters will discuss
more in depth
health education courses
are the primary avenue
for youth across New Mexico
to receive information
about suicide prevention in
schools. But in addition
to this pe D and the
Department of Health also
engage in active efforts
to prevent youth suicide.
State law requires
health education in fourth through
eighth grades as well as
for high school students to earn a high
school diploma.
You will see health education
standards related to suicide
prevention. In that red box.
On page four.
On page five. The
brief provides an outline
of state agency and school
support to prevent youth
suicide including through
le a wellness policy
and school safety plans.
The three levels of
intervention to prevent youth
suicide and then moving
to page six
professional guidelines for
school counselors and school
nurses, both of which are
required to respond to health
and mental health needs related to
suicide and suicide
prevention.
Pages six and seven,
lay out some state policy
options. You may want to
consider state
actions regarding suicide
prevention generally center
on health education
professional development for
suicide prevention and
requiring the development of
suicide prevention
policies.
While New Mexico currently
addresses suicide prevention through
health education,
lawmakers may want to consider
funding and requiring
professional development
on youth suicide prevention
as well as codifying
the requirement for local
education agencies to
adopt suicide prevention
policies.
The Legislative Finance Committee
released an action plan
on suicide prevention in
2020 that
recommended New Mexico set a
goal to reduce
suicide by 10%
over the next five years
and take targeted action
regularly monitor data
and routinely meet to
determine if it's moving
towards its goal.
In its report, LFC
recommends targeting investments
to reduce suicide through
evidence based programs
in schools shown to
work noting this could
help the state not only meet
but exceed the goal
of reducing suicide by
10% in five
years. For
example, the QP
R Gatekeeper Training
certification course which
some school districts are already
using is an evidence
based approach to train
individuals and schools to
effectively intervene
and prevent suicide.
Finally, the legislature
should consider investing in the
pipeline to increase the
recruitment and retention
of mental health professionals
to ensure schools are able to
meet the mental health needs of
all students
pe D should work with
school districts to expand
or require evidence-based
suicide prevention training for
school personnel targeting
high suicidality
areas and require
suicide prevention programming
in middle and high schools.
That concludes my brief
overview. Um I will now
turn it over to the Public Education
Department. After the
entire panel has
presented, we will stand for
questions.
>> Thank you.
Merit.
Good afternoon, Mr chairman
and members of the committee.
My name is Mark Delena
Sonia Saiz. I am the Behavioral
Health Manager and
also Deputy Director
of the Safe and Healthy Schools for
Public Education
Department.
Today, I would like to share some
relevant um start
by sharing some relevant
statistics regarding suicide
in our state
which will lead into impact
and risk factors, The
importance of suicide
prevention, how
my bureau supports
leas with
their suicide prevention
efforts and the
future direction of our
continued support.
In addition to legislative
considerations,
I am a part of the New
Mexico Suicide Prevention
Coalition.
Part of the coalition's mission
is to educate, to
plan and implement
efforts to reduce suicide
across our state.
Members of the Department of
Health who are also part
of the coalition recently
shared the most
updated data for New
Mexico and I wanted
to share a few of
those data points with you
today.
New Mexico had the fourth
highest rate of suicide among
all us states in
2022
suicide is the second leading
cause of death for people.
Ages 10 to
34.
In 2022 more
than half of suicide deaths were
due to firearms.
Youth specific data
points that I wanted to
present to you. Today is
in 2022. The suicide
count among Children,
18 years of age or
younger was 20
and between October and
December of
2023
101 youth
ages 5 to 17
made visits to emergency
departments related to
a suicide
attempt.
As a former school social
worker and district
behavioral health leader, I can
attest to
the
impact a death by
suicide has on an entire
community.
Not only is prevention
necessary, it is
important to be aware of what
groups have higher rates of
suicide to be to
be considerate of how to
approach suicide
prevention
efforts.
Now, for the good
news through
prevention and
awareness is where hope
lies
suicide is
preventable.
The Center for Disease Control
and Prevention developed the suicide
prevention resource for action
that is outlined for you on
this slide.
This is just one resource
that is available to guide suicide
prevention efforts in
communities and
schools. Two
other resources that
recently came to my
attention. Um Prior
to me, submitting the
presentation
are um
through the, the
CDC division of
adolescent and school
health is the mental
health and well being in schools
action guide that is
available
and about a
week ago, the surgeon
general released a
new 2024
national strategy
for suicide
prevention. So we do
have a number of
resources to guide
our work.
The safe and healthy schools
Bureau provides le a
support and their suicide
prevention efforts through
several ways.
Our future direction is
to continue and
enhance these
efforts.
Some examples
as far as our safe school
program are, um
we recently held a
couple of psychological
first aid
professional development to
train the trainer model.
So that we can expand
the reach of this
type of
professional development
across our state.
Through our behavioral health
program, I have
overseen and,
and managed and led
um supports
uh through restorative justice
practices, social
emotional learning
and wellness room
programs. And
of course, in collaboration
with our statewide
partners, specifically,
Department of Health, we
hold an annual head
to toe conference
for our behavioral
health providers and a
number of administrators
and teachers also attend
that conference.
We would like to expand
school based health centers
to include Medicaid
bill billing for
um our non
special education
students.
And then of course, we
have our expanding opportunities
program which is really
focused on increasing
behavioral health
providers.
Specifically, we're
focusing on rural
areas.
So and then of course,
which leads me to additional
legislative considerations
is the continued funding
for our behavioral health
support
programs um
included on the site. A, a
few of which I already
mentioned. But
um I also wanted
to include
the increase of
residential treatment services
for students, which is a collab
which would be a collaboration
with the Department of
Health.
And then of course, I have a slide
with data sources
and references.
And then I also
wanted
to bring your
attention
to um the

>> I'm Deborah Boca, the health services
coordinator for BN Consolidated
Schools.
Mr
Chair
Lec, I'd like
to start with really talking about,
oh, my Mike.
I'd like to start by
talking about what it is
that Belan Consolidated
Schools is doing for our
staff and our
parents, our
counselors and our nurses work
with the students on a regular
basis. They do
assessments. They're,
they're out there communicating with the
students in that book. You never
know where our students are gonna
go, who they're gonna ask for
help in that. So
we've really taken approach
at looking at what it
is that we can
provide for our staff.
We're looking at training for
the staff services and
supports that we can provide for
our parents and
also for our students and
any future training that we can
do for our students
back in 2019
2020 prior to
COVID Belen High school
started and Mr
Sanchez, our current superintendent
was the principal. At that
time, he started a program
on Wednesdays
where
they did professional
development for the
students in the morning. And there were
various classes that went
on and that and one of
the classes that we did for students
then was QP because
we had started to train
some of our staff as instructors.
But we also did that training for
our high school teachers
so that they would
be aware. But we did
that training for our
senior students. Then
COVID hit and we
kind of had to backtrack and
start really looking
at what it was we would do
every year. We've done training
for our counselors and for
our nurses,
but we need, we knew
we needed to expand it.
Then in
2122
when we were back in
school and everybody
was there. Mr Sanchez
was the superintendent at
that time or is the
superintendent?
And he allowed me
to do an offer.
QP R. By that time, we had
trained 15 instructors
within the district. And we,
the first day before students
came on campus,
we trained every single
staff member and we have done
it every year since that
includes our maintenance people,
our bus drivers, our bus
aides, it includes our
custodians. It includes our
cooks because
again, we
don't know where our students
are gonna go and who they're gonna
seek help from. So it
became important to
us to train
the entire staff.
We had community
people that were also QP
R instructors and
we sent them out to all the,
all the sites that
was the first training that we
did, whether it was in the
morning or in the afternoon,
depending on how we could
rotate people around.
And we have continued
that every year
since
uh the first year,
staff was resistant.
Some of them were concerned
you know, I, you can't
expect me to ask the
question.
Uh, how
am I gonna recognize it? What
if? But now
is we've done it
each year. They,
they asked more questions.
They want more
information.
I get phone calls all
the time when they think there's something
that's going on with a student who
should they go to? Did they
ask this question? Right.
So they
realize that they are
part of the solution
and it becomes,
you know, it becomes
easier for everybody when we've
got a team that
that's doing it, there's
ownership now with our
team, they're on
high alert.
Uh
Again, we get more
and more responses.
Bus drivers see
those kids. First thing in the
morning counselors are
getting calls or I'm getting
a call so that I can get that
information to a counselor
so we can follow up with
them. We can
ask the questions
now in terms of
our parents and that
we are really
trying to do some
things. The unconsolidated
schools is part of
the central regional
educational coop.
And a year ago
there was a grant avai
available.
They applied for it. We were
looking at applying for
a grant for additional monies
for behavioral therapy
or behavioral support.
They applied for it
because we are part of
that coop, we
benefited from the fact that they
got the grant. So
they have hired
social workers,
social workers are working
in several of our schools
now, mental health
training and some of the training
programs that they offer
are available to our staff
for free because we're
part of that group.
We are able now
for our, our general
ed students, we're able to
offer them more.
Uh, we have social workers
that are working in
several of our school sites
and we've kind of targeted the
schools that we've
seen bigger
issues or more behaviors
in that we have, they're
helping us with in terms
of behavioral analyst
approaches. In that,
uh
they, our first
summer that they came on
board, they brought the Help Me
program, which
we got the information out
to parents and to students, you
know, that anonymous
line that they can call and
say, you know, I've got questions,
I need help. You know,
we get those notifications.
So that was kind of the
approach that we took that
first year.
Since then.
We have really
looked at uh
what else can we do? We
recently or
this past year we
worked with all faith
for the wraparound
program. Journey to Wellness
came to us and said that they wanted
to work with two of our
uh our further out
schools, uh Gil Sanchez
and La Promesa, they wanted to work
with those students.
So
we look at our
community as a whole
and what they can do, we work with
h two academics
and we recently signed
a contract with Cook
Center which offers
lots of different programs
for our parents. We did our
first parent
engagement uh
workshop on
Tuesday of last week. There
were just a small number of
people there, but
we hope that with each
time it'll be better. We,
the program that we chose was
social media. And
how do parents talk to their
kids about social media
and what it is that they can
do in
the fall, the first program
will be attendance and then
we'll tie it into
different programs,
but these are live seminars
that we can offer. It offers
coaching. It
offers uh
a therapist that they can
call in and talk to and
get additional information.
So again, we,
we meet with our students,
but we really are
looking at how can
we educate our parents,
how can we get them involved
and how do we get our entire
staff so that they all
recognize what is
going on?
Thank
you.
>> Good afternoon. Um My
name is Vicky Price. I'm the
senior Director of Counseling
Services for Albuquerque
Public Schools.
Um I oversee
252
counselors and
also about
60 behavior redirection
in elementary schools.
>> And I'm Sherri Beaker.
I am the Senior Director
of Nursing Services for Albuquerque
Public Schools
and we have about
100 and 30
nurses and 100 and
35 health assistants
and we do a lot
of teaming
and collaborative work with
counseling.
>> So today, I just wanted
to give you an overview of
what our procedural directive
is in AP S
so we have an overall procedural
directive that, that
addresses student suicide
prevention intervention and
postvention
practices. Um
We also have a very specific
protocol that we follow
when a student is
brought to us with suicidal
ideation.
So, um I'm
gonna go through each of those
today um and
talk about the individual
programs.
So as far as prevention goes,
we always start with our staff,
staff is required every
staff member in AP S
is required to take
a safe schools training.
That's an online training that
includes suicide
prevention and
they take that annually
also as part of our procedural
directive,
um we're
required to
uh do a face to face
training at a staff meeting
in every single uh school
in AP S and all
staff members are
required to be at that
training. So,
um right at the beginning of the
school year, we get both of
those uh trainings
done. Um
That training is prepared
um by
the district counseling office.
Um So that the school
counselors, the nurse,
um whoever the
principal thinks is the appropriate
person to um
present that education
to staff um at
that annual meeting. But
we do that, we provide a
framework so that it's
consistent information
is given out to every staff
member.
Um We also
provide additional
um specialized
training for school counselors,
nurses and social
workers on what to
do when the student
is brought to them expressing
suicidal statements or
ideation.
And this and this is ongoing
um training throughout
the year. Uh We do
additionally provide youth
mental health first train, first
aid training to our staff.
Any staff member can train
that we have uh
several trainers in our
district. Um
That can do that.
Um
Another piece of prevention of
course is this is the student
education piece.
So um as
part of
what we do in our
school district um
during health education
classes for 7th and 9th
grade is part of the health
standards. So they do
cover suicide prevention
in 7th and 9th grade.
Additionally, uh
school counselors
teach another lesson in
middle school and
in high school. So
they're, they're required to
for middle school, for example,
they're required to teach a
lesson around suicide
prevention, either
in sixth grade or eighth grade to
complement what the health
um teacher did in seventh
grade in high school.
Um They are
required school counselors
are required to teach a lesson
to 10th, 11th or 12th
grade. They have the option of picking
the year, but many of our schools
do it
in, in every classroom,
every year. Um
We utilize for these
lessons. We utilize
um Jason
Foundation which is a free
nonprofit
um organization that
provides a great
evidence-based lesson.
We utilize that mostly
for um
middle school. And then we
use a Trevor Trevor
project uh for
high school. Again, it's
a free resource
and we also utilize
Erica's Lighthouse.
School counselors do have the
option of supplementing
and adding to the lesson. But anything
they do, we approve it the
district office and we make sure it's
research and evidence-based
material, but we do encourage
them to, you know, make
the lessons
um
address the needs of their
schools.
Um
I would, the other thing
that we've had for the last
four years is we were fortunate
to get a, a grant through
the county to fund
a peer helpers program.
We have peer helper
programs in 21 of our
schools currently
and it's considered an
extracurricular
activity. We
pay a small stipend
to a sponsor at
each school to help run
that program. Um
Through that program, the peer
helpers learn all the
skills
um
needed to identify when
their friends are at risk.
What resources to give them,
how to take their hand and walk
to the nurse counselors, social
worker to get help. Immediately,
they do um
community outreach
projects every single
year um in the
fall and in the spring
um last year alone,
the peer helpers,
their outreach
reach reached
40,000 students
last year. So it was
pretty impressive what they did.
They go to numerous community
events they present in classrooms,
they do school assemblies.
Um They are, are
really a conduit
conduit to
youth helping
youth understand suicide
because all the data that you're
gonna hear kids tell their
friends first. So we
need to tell, you know,
get the kids aware of
what they can do to help.
Um They do go
through all, all the specialized
training, they,
they get additional
training through their sponsors.
We have a person that oversees that
program. The struggle we
always have with that program is
it's so funded through a grant.
So we're, every year we're, we're
trying to fight to continue
to fund that
program.
Um
So once a a student,
so that covers more of our prevention
piece. But once a student is
identified in a school,
um, as having
ideation or making a
suicidal statement or
any kind of stroke,
uh, any
kind of statement that indicates
that they may want to harm themselves
or hurt themselves,
then,
uh, per our protocol
and through our training,
every staff knows they need to get
that student and they walk them
there, they don't send them by themselves.
They walk them to the nurse counselors,
social worker and we stay
with that student. We,
we talk with them
and we talk about
how they're feeling.
We, we do
basically a pre assessment
to determine what next
steps we need to follow.
In any case.
Whenever we talk to a student
about suicide or
making suicidal statements,
we call home 100%
of the time. So even
if a student says, yeah, I
didn't mean it. And
the counselor nurses, social worker
feels like it was, it was
said out of context
or, or in a way that they
didn't have intent
to harm. We still call the
parents and talk to them about
them making that statement.
Majority of the time though,
I would say when we
talk to students,
we call the parents and ask
them to come in
and we have a very unique
situation in AP
S um AP S
pays for an outside
contractor to provide
free same day assessments
for any student
that expresses ideation.
I'm gonna share some of that data with
you. Um, in just a
second, um,
when the parents come
in, they're,
they're offered uh several
referral options. The first is
a no cost, same day risk
assessment. The
second is a uh
suicide assessment
with the students own providers.
Sometimes the students have
ongoing um,
psychiatrists or, or
psychologists that they're seeing
or physicians that they're seeing
in the family, of course, has that option
to go to that provider.
Um Sometimes
we refer directly to
a hospital setting depending
on the acuity of the
ideation at that point.
Um
And then the parents also have
the option of declining the referral.
We do our very best to try
and convince families that
let's go get an assessment,
let's let's be
safe. Um
But, but they do have the option
to decide because we are dealing with
minors and parents have
the right to refuse services.
>> And I'm gonna throw in
here just
in the 30 minutes before
Vicky and I left to come
here, we were collaborating
on supporting an elementary
school student at a
school and helping
support the school to do
what they needed to do to
follow through the
protocol.
>> Um I
also uh provide
a uh crisis
line number for
the school staff and it's man
7 a.m. to 9 p.m.
every day. So
that if somebody going through the
protocol needs assistance and
needs to talk to somebody and needs
to consult because these are
often very hard
uh strenuous cases.
So we do provide that and I
have a specially trained
uh crisis resource counselor
that assists them.
Um So now
I just want to give you just kind of an
overview of what our
protocol data looks like. So
when kids make their way to
us, um as you can
see for this year, so far, this
year, 700
or I mean, 641
students have
made their way to a nurse counselor
or social worker.
Um Sometimes people
are a little bit alarmed by this number. It
can be upwards of 1200
every in a certain school
year. But just know these
are the number of times we've had the
opportunity to intervene,
help a student and
potentially save their life.
So, you know,
we
we like to tell
students that we're here to help and we
take it seriously. And when,
when a students brought to us
with ideation, everything
else stops for the day. That's
what we focus on getting
the student's parent in there, getting
connected, them connected to
help. So as
you can see, um,
I won't go through all the data
but about, uh,
this school year
335
selected the no
costs, um, free
same day assessment. We
make the appointment from our office
so they can, they can
go directly to,
to the
agency. Um,
it works very well.
Occasionally we'll have no shows
that they'll decide in the drive down
that they don't want to. But there is, that's
very low, low
number.
Um,
100 and one selected their
own providers. 60 went
directly to a hospital
setting. In certain
cases, we may have called an
ambulance if there
was a high
acuity or something happened
where they attempted at the
school. Um, and
then 100 and 45
declined and you can see
that goes down for
the last three school years
just to sort of put it in
perspective of how
many of these that we were
looking at every
year.
Um, our postvention
and follow up when a
student is sent
for an assessment or to their
hospital or to, to the
hospital of their own provider. In any
case the next day
or when the student returns to
school,
the nurse
counselors, social worker will follow
up, see how they're
feeling, see what
happened, make sure there's
ongoing services.
They'll also call home and talk to
parents. Um They may
need some additional
referrals and
we will provide all of that at
that time.
Um We
do have occasions where we
call the student in
and they are expressing the
same thing and we start the process
all over again. So
we get them another free
same day assessment
or if
at this point it is heightened
and we feel like going to the
agency wasn't
what worked for the student, then we would
call the parent and recommend they take
them to a hospital setting.
Um We are partnering,
uh UN M
is uh
opening a
uh
emergency room for
psychiatric visits. So
they came and trained our counselors.
That's going to be a, a
great place for us to
send students. So they don't have to go
to the regular
um emergency
room.
Um
The other thing I
can tell you is
we do
in the event that there's any
student deaths regardless of
what the case is, whether it's
suicide or something else.
Um We do have
a district
uh trained team
that can go in and
help this, help the
school start recovering.
Um We never share cause of
death ever in any
scenario because
um uh we,
we're just not simply the
people that share that information
and we, we just don't
track that, but anytime there's a
student death, we
have a team of people that can go
into the school district.
They are trained in the critical
incident, stress management
recovery model. It's
about 40 people on this
team. They're highly trained.
Um They've been doing it for years.
We've, we've gone to many other
school districts and just in this last
month, we helped two other school districts
that had crises
at their school. Um
Also, if there's a staff member,
death or another highly
impactful um
tragedy at a school,
we will go in and help with
that. Also, if there
is maybe a concerning event,
we've had times when
um maybe
there's been a bus accident
and kids are traumatized by
what happened. This team can
go in and help with that as
well. Um
So we're very proud of that
team and
uh they are highly
trained individuals
um who volunteer
to do that. They don't get any
extra pay for being on that team.
They believe in the work and they
believe how important it is
to save lives in AP S
and I'll let Cheryl add anything
at this point. Um
If she would like >> well,
and I just say in addition
to this, we have a
formalized uh
reentry planning
process for
post mental health
hospitalization
and we collaborate
between
nursing uh
counseling and the social
workers on this.
It's primarily the
nurses that take the lead on
that, that particular
post hospitalization
reentry. We also
have a collaborative team
on a post
overdose response
team and
we do reentry planning
for students that have experienced
overdose
>> and in the event that
there's a a
suicide attempt
on campus, uh
We also have a process
for that because we want
to welcome the student back to
school when and,
and the family and come up with a, a
good safety plan for the
student upon their
return.
Thank you very much and,
and thanks for bringing this topic
up because we believe
that it's the most important
thing we can
do.
Yeah,
>> great. >> Thank you all for the
presentation. Uh Representative
Buck, >> thank you, Mr Chairman.
I will be brief and so if I
can't answer in two or three
senators, I haven't done
my job.
Um Mr Chairman
panel.
Do any of you guys
oversee the anonymous
reporting? I know that's a requirement of
districts. Is that something
that deputy Director CS at
your office oversees or
who oversees that
requirement? >> So
our um safety
school
coordinator
oversee was
doing some training,
collaborating with the,
with the vendor
that we were working with.
And then it was through a
grant
that to my
recollection that
schools could
apply and opt in
to have that type
of um reporting
system if they didn't, if
they hadn't implemented
one on their own
in their district or their
school. >> Thank
you. My district uses a anonymous
reporting and at least
two or three times a week, we get reports
of I'm worried about so and so
and so sad. So and so is the pressed
so and so is cutting.
So I do think that that's an
important piece about it is that
somebody or
has, you know,
the has knowledge of this
happening and is able to report
it to a trusted adult
or an anonymous
adult. Um Mr
Chairman, the, the question
and this is for our councilors at AP
S one of
the
complaints that I've, I've
heard or one of the challenges I've heard
from our school counselors
is that they're tied up, their
time is tied up with other things and
not able to focus on the counseling.
Whether it be testing, whether it
be scheduling is, is that the experience
you've had with the A PS?
>> Um We've been pretty
successful. Uh
Sorry, I didn't answer
correctly. Um
um Mr Chair and
Representative Baca, thanks
for the question. Um
We have
been successful
in the last few years getting some
of those duties off the plate
of the council um
in our district, they don't do 50
fours. They um
they might help with testing
coordination, but they're not in charge
of it. Um
We try and really
streamline their day to be
counseling duties.
Um And we
follow the American School
Counselors Association model
for our counselors. So,
um
they, they do a
combination of
academics, personal,
social um
and, and college and
career readiness. That's
part of the national model and that's what
we try and get them to focus on
doing. Of course, in,
in high school, they're going to do more
administrative type things
and in elementary, they're gonna get in
classrooms a lot more, but
that's our basic model.
Uh But we've worked very hard to
get extra duties off their
plates. >> And thank
you, Mr Chairman. You, you did mention
as far as when we talked about the students
that, that we lost.
What, what are
one of as far as the what
factor or what uh
degree does social
media cyberbullying also play
into this? Because uh
Mr Chairman, I would, I would
speculate that many of our students.
Once they leave school,
you walk around, you'll see
75% or not more
of students here.
So is that
something also in and merit
as well that we're seeing as far as
the social media and some
of the cyberbullying as
a compounding factor
in um
this
tragedy,
>> Mr Chair Representative
Vaca in my research,
what I found is there's no
one cause of
suicide, it's complex,
but something that does come up
again and again is
the rise in social media.
Although um we can't really
draw a 1 to 1
correlation
>> and thank you. My last question is very,
very. So you guys
are men mentioned the
uh youth resilience
survey. I forget all
the, how many, how many
responses did we do
we have or have compiled
as of, you know, when that's sent
out?
>> Um Mr Chair
of Representative Baca.
Thank you for that question.
I do not have that
number readily available, but
I could, I could retrieve
it and then make sure that that
information gets to you.
>> And thank you. And my only reason for
asking the question is we want to make sure
that we have the full picture because
my fear is that the numbers
are higher. So I
think that's what we have to incentivize
and really try to be
more diligent about getting that
information. So Mr Chairman,
thank you.
Thank you, you represent
here.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you uh for the presentation.
Um I've
had 2/6 graders refer
friends in the
middle of class.
Um It's hard we
go out on the porch, you leave
your class, you wait for someone to come
and get them. So thank
you for what you're doing um
on AP S it.
Um You've listed um
Miss Price the same day
protocols. Have you broken
that down by age and grade
level? >> We
um
thank you, Representative G
for that question. We do have
that information broken down
that way. Um It
could be provided if, if
that's needed.
Um, but we have
seen, we've kind of followed
the national trends. We've seen
an uptick in
1110, 11
year olds, which the nation is
seen as well. We also
see ninth grade as a high
risk
grade.
>> Thank you for that. And then my other question
is Colorado has
an anonymous gun
possession, uh,
reporting line. It's
statewide, a
child of
youth who
knows that somebody has
possession of a gun
can anonymously report
it because if you report it
to the principal or a
teacher
too often people
figure out, oh, that person reported
it. Have we
explored anything like
that at the state level? It seems
to be an effective
kind of thing and
because both suicide
and unfortunately
shootings of other people
occur,
>> Mr Chair and Representative
Garrett. Thank you for that um,
question not
to my knowledge, but I can
definitely look into that
for. >> Thank
you because Mr Chair, it's
like each district
can do it. But you
know, kids
don't really
talk about what district they live
in or what school they're at.
But if it's anonymous, it
changes the name of the game. Thank
you very much for looking into
that. >> Any
other questions, >> Senator
Stewart?
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I, I
just want to thank
Vicky and Cheryl in
particular. My,
my district is A P
SI. Had no
idea that
it, the plan,
the work that you do,
what you've laid out
so thoroughly
depending upon
what is happening was
actually happening in A P SI.
Mean, it's thrilling to
me. You know, people are
saying those numbers, well, you
know, we've got 78,000
kids and 100
and 40 schools.
So now those
look sort of normal
for a district that
size if we can look
at normal. So I
do have one question
and you probably can't answer
it. But,
um,
the, the research
nationwide on
attendance
is really pointing
to the pandemic
saying that, you know,
kids just got used
to not going to school
and their parents got used
to. Well, you have to stay
home and babysit your sister
today because I've got to do
this or that.
And the whole
idea of you've got a
job, your
job is going to school and you
get up and you get there on time,
that's your job. It's just
kind of has gone out the
window that,
um, especially since some
kids actually could
learn online.
Uh, not
very many, uh but
some, and
some really liked it
because they didn't like
the other kids.
So it's
really complicated
now, I believe
in the schools with
what kids have gone
through and what their parents
have gone through. And
I'm just sort of wondering
if you could make
a similar cor correlation
between
uh uh
an increase in,
in teen suicides
or attempt or even just thinking
about it because there
was a lot of
isolation that
happened during the
pandemic. You
know, some, some people
uh uh
improve their relationships,
others, the relationships
fell apart. Uh
My daughter,
just her
whole relationship with her
husband fell apart in the
pandemic. Um
So my partner
and I got closer,
he lost £30.
I lost 15, we
exercised, I cooked
more. Um We had
fun
but not everybody
used the pandemic
like that. And
so, um
I think
it's our legacy
now and it's gonna be a legacy
for a while.
Um Just that
I told a story earlier
about my stepson, his eight
year old daughter who just hadn't learned
to read because she hadn't been in school
for first or second grade
where you're supposed to learn how to
read. Uh
So
I'm, I'm wondering if
you sort of see that
sort of similar correlation
that we're gonna see for a
while. Um
Because if we just
let kids
well fix it yourself,
you're home. You know, I
don't know how you're gonna fix it,
but sorry. We don't
have any help from your
school.
So,
>> Mr Chair and
uh, Senator Stewart,
whom I've bugged
many times over the
years.
Um
I think there's a lot of things
that we can
make some associations
with the pandemic.
One of the things
that
my team dealt with
quite a bit
and this
doesn't have anything to do with
suicidality,
but we
had an enormous
number of
students who
came back to school
or entered school for the
first time who
were not
potty trained.
I'm not talking
a disability
related issue
with needing
support in
order to perform that
activity of daily living.
I'm talking,
they just
didn't know how
to do it.
And so we've done a lot
of intervention
in teaching
kids
basic
basic tasks
that are normally
handled at a
family level,
but families were
stressed.
Yeah,
parents were
working, they were
trying to keep food on the table,
they were trying to have an income,
they were trying to help
their kids with online
education
and some things
had to go
and, and so
self-care,
I think also went out the
window. Family
care
suffered
my two
cents.
>> Um and
Mr Chair and
Senator Stewart, thank you
for your comments. We do work really
hard and we're really proud
of what we do to prevent
suicide in AP S.
Um I would concur
a lot with what
um Cheryl has
indicated here.
Um I think what,
what we really focused
on coming back from the
pandemic was reso
resocialization.
Everybody.
And because if,
if students feel
connected and there's a sense of
belongings
and we start helping them work
on coping skills and,
and being part
of a community of
care, then we're
going to reduce
um the
trauma that
they incurred some
incurred during COVID.
So we,
we really had a strong focus
on let's make
school the most welcoming,
safe environment that we
possibly could. I think
we always strive for that. But I think
after the pandemic, everybody
knew we had to take it up
a notch because kids needed a
place to feel like
they belonged.
>> Well, thank you for those answers.
Mr Chairman just reminded
me about when Les C went
to Aztec after the
shooting and
we heard from those
students and
they said to us,
we just want to have a room
where we can go and sit down and
relax. We just
want to have a 10 minute mental
health check-in with
somebody.
Uh because, you know, last
night I couldn't sleep or
last night I had the nightmares
again or I don't go out
anymore now because I'm afraid
of getting shot. So,
so this is real
and just think of the world
we're in now.
So uh Representative
Herndon had this idea
to require a
mental health room
in every school.
Uh You know, we can't really
do that. It doesn't
work with the way we
fund things, et cetera.
But I think that
that idea has taken
on. I think it's turned it
into a memorial.
Um, but I'm hoping
that, uh, that,
that we're doing that in at least
some of the schools where
we've just got a mental
health room where you can just
go and relax and,
you know, have a good cry
or whatever you need
and get back to
school.
So, thank you. Thank you all
for what we do.
>> Oh, Mr Chair and
Representative Stewart,
thank you so much for bringing
that to everyone's
attention. Um Wellness
rooms, we actually have a
pilot running
right now. We have funded
12 schools
um to create a
wellness room
and, and or enhance
what they've already had.
I, I actually
like to refer them as wellness
spaces because
some of them are being very
creative as
far as um
you know, identifying when they
don't have an extra room, as I
heard in the presentation
before ours that we just
don't have space
sometimes, right?
So they're creating maybe corners
in classrooms and
they're, they're putting a lot
of different aims to them and
they're providing a
number of different
um you
know, um support.
So something even
like coloring for
adults because sometimes
what they're able to do is
open these rooms up
to their staff as well,
which I, I
believe firmly
is just as important
um attending to
our, our staff,
um mental well being
and whatnot. So,
um I greatly appreciate
you bringing that up and it was
one of the
legislative considerations
to be able to continue the
funding because it, it's
um
it's not available for the coming
year currently. So,
and people are already reaching
out, um I had
over 40 applications
for these rooms, but some
of the districts or leas
have figured out how to utilize
their title four funding.
Other federal funding
to um be able
to, the start up is
really that they need
and then continued
funding to make
sure that there's um
continuous
oversight. Right?
Because if we're looking at it as
a layer one
support and protection,
which just like when we
need to go and use the
restroom, sometimes we just
need to take a minute,
right? So if we're able
to allow these
spaces to be open
and available to all
students also at
any time, that
would be ideal. So,
thank you so much.
>> Well, that's so that was Mr
Chairman, that was represent Herndon's
right. You followed that.
So you're going to give us a kind
of report on that
pilot
>> working on that.
>> All right. Well, Mr Chairman, I'll just
end with saying
I watched a good movie a
few nights ago that has
all these issues in it. It's
called the
Holdovers
and it just
uh you feel pretty good at the end
of it, you don't feel so good in it,
but at the end of it,
you thank
>> you
>> the neuter
sauce.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Uh
My wife is
the started
the group down in Las
Cruces for suicide
prevention task force and is head
of it and she's watching and
so she kind of helped uh
or sent me some questions
about things and I think one of the biggest
things she indicated and this may be
more of a statement for
us as legislators
is.
>> 00, I just want to know
where
>> uh but
is to ensure
that we have
funding for that
much staff currently, so much
of the staff that are would deal
with this are busy
with it just doing scheduling
of kids and so many
other areas
that they have to stop all
of that, which they're already
too busy doing that in order
to do this. And so as
we're looking at budget type things,
making sure that we've got enough
funding and staff
to have true mental health
professionals. They're not
just counselors that are
helping people get in the right
classes because
they're overwhelmed as it is. And
when something tragic
happens, they're
already full. The
other one question
for the, the
Albuquerque people
is when there's been a
completed suicide,
what are the protocols to
address the grief and trauma?
And let me frame it a little bit
down in the Las Cruces area. They
discourage having
Centra ceremonies
because it's very can be very
triggering to other
kids or just regulate some of the
other kids. But what kinds of
programs are there
for the other,
the school community when there's
been a completed
suicide?
>> Um uh
Mr Chair and
Senator Seles, that's a great
question. It's very
informed.
Um
We, we follow
that critical incident, stress
management model.
So our job is to
go in and provide recovery
and healing and we start that
process. So
it we follow a very
prescribed way of going to
classrooms, making announcements
in classrooms. Um
Again, we don't ever share
cause of death, but
students sometimes will say we
heard it was
a car accident, we
heard it was a suicide and we will
meet them where they are and talk about
that. We also set up
safe rooms in schools
so kids can come throughout the
day, talk with
us. Um
We do debriefings with
staff uh
sometimes
uh depending on
what happened, a
school might be canceled for
a day. So we'll debrief the staff
for an entire day, getting them ready
to come in. But we give
staff a script to
follow so that
we don't traumatize
students anymore.
We also want to make
sure we use straightforward,
easy to understand
language. Um
And what you were also talking
about was when kids want
to do memorials or they want
to gather
um
in AP S we, we
don't encourage or discourage
that if students um
high school students in particular,
they like to get together and
process it all together.
We many times
it would be after school or
it will be in a location near
the school. Often school
staff will be there to monitor
that. But
you know, we let people process
the, the way they want to,
to process at that point.
What what we provide
is um
information that in your
school tomorrow, these services
will be available to you
and we'll be, we'll have
trained professionals there to
talk to you. Um One
thing I would caution is that we're not
grief counselors. We're, it's a
recovery team. It's
a recovery after
tragedy team.
>> Thank you. That, that's very helpful
and informative uh kind
to circle back to one of the earlier
presentations on
funding and budget.
You know, we always get very frustrated
on this committee because we
see all of the needs in places
where money fixes
problems. Uh,
and then try and convince
the LFC, I mean, you had talked
about the need for funding
for Wellness
Spaces.
Why are we fighting
about that kind of money?
If we ought to have money to do
that, we ought to have money.
And, uh, some of the things out of Las
Cruces when they've interviewed and
talked with kids, kids want
things like life coaches
and more peer to peer
programs.
Some require some
staffing and money.
But those are the kinds of things
that districts
because of the other missions
never have enough money to do
those other things that
are so needed to keep
kids in schools and literally
keep them safe and
alive. Um And
so, you know, I, I
guess I'm kind of trying to coach
us all up a little bit when people
ask, well, what are they going to use the money
for? Here are a couple of
very specific things where
if there were a little bit of discretionary
money could make real differences
for kids. So thank you, Mr
Chair,
>> right. Don't
have any other questions, but thank
you all so much for being here today
and thank you all for the work you all do
each and every day. Thank
you.
All right, folks.
So we'll go
to our last
agenda item for the day, which
is public comment.
So we have
a couple of folks that
have signed up
online.
Um So we'll start
off with them. But please remember
folks we have
um and you all will
have up to two
minutes um
to address us. So
please keep it within the two
minutes
and we'll go to
Charles.
Hi, Charles. You
have
up to two minutes.
Oh, we're just
joining.
All
right,
Charles
>> quick points.
I'd like you to consider for your agenda
as you're going forward.
One is that every
day on a a student
gets on a school bus in New
Mexico. Your respiratory
health and cognitive
abilities are negatively
impacted by the
particular matter that
they're breathing in while they're on that
bus. Uh Last year's
HB 75 the school
bus Monitor Organization Act is
going to be your injury. Uh
Sorry, reintroduce this
year. Hope you'll consider
that for your agenda.
Two, it's getting warmer,
healthy climate, New Mexico,
a group of doctors and other medical
and health professionals just released.
A heat advisory
schools are often turned into
cooling and emergencies,
shelters. What
efforts are being made to
ensure the safety of our school
staff and students with
the least interruption
to the educational process. When
that happens, the usually
of heat and extreme weather impacts
on our students and school systems
is an appropriate topic as
well. Finally,
regarding the presentations
today on suicide
attention must be paid to the
impact of climate change and related
concerns among youth.
The impacts of climate change
intersect with and compound other
factors that threaten youth
mental health. According to
the American Psychological
Association,
policies and programs that
expand access to mental health
care are needed.
Uh As climate
impacts increase
community solutions including
prevention, early detection are
critical climate action and
resilience plans are needed. It
must include provisions for
Children and other vulnerable
communities and finally
creating opportunities for young
people to get involved will
benefit their mental health,
boost social connection
and personal efficacy and
alleviate anxiety.
Thank you very much. I hope you'll
consider these three topics
for the rest of your agenda.
Thank you. >> Great. Thank you
Charles. So
next we'll go to
Debbie.
Hi, Debbie. You have up to two
minutes.
Welcome,
Debbie.
All right, I see that we have
Wendy
Wendy.
Hello. Are you
there?
Hi, you have up to two minutes.
Welcome.
>> Hi. Thank you. Hi. My
name is uh Wendy Miller
Thomlinson. I'm the deputy
superintendent for teaching and
learning at for Las Cruces Public
Schools and
I would just like to take
a minute to advocate
for the fine
arts um
education
um
uh application
grant application.
And currently,
the, the Fine Arts
uh education appli
application
requires district
assurances that
guaranteed
to guarantee that this
funding is
actually allocated
to fine Arts.
So as an
educator in a
district that highly does
use the arts and
fine arts education,
um we would like to ensure
that this funding
um continues to go
to Fine Arts, not just in the Las
Cruces public schools,
but in districts
across the state.
I was just listening to the
presentation about
suicide prevention
and mental health and
we all know that the
things that engage
students, the things that
they love is one of the
things that helps
um to keep them
safe. So,
um with that, I would just
like to continue to
advocate that
we have a mechanism
um in the form
of assurances
for the fine arts
um allocations that
go to school districts
to
um to the
main part
of the
process for
districts obtaining
that funding.
So I appreciate your time
um this afternoon
and thanks everyone
for all
the
>> great, thank you so
much for joining us
all. We'll try,
Debbie's not even there anymore.
All we'll go
to our
in person
folks.
Uh So first one list
stand,
that was, that was two minutes stan.
Thank
you.
Thank
you
>> uh Mr Chairman. Good
Day stand rounds
with the school
or the Coalition of Education Leaders
and the Superintendents Association.
First of all, I want
to congratulate Superintendent
Sanche over here and his
staff. You heard
this morning,
the things that are going to create
the best schooling environments
in this state. This is a great
example of how a
local district does its
work.
And we need to recognize
that we hear a lot of things
otherwise this is
great. But let me, let me focus
on something that I also know
about their budget and
about a bunch of other
budgets.
We have a problem. You heard
that this morning, I want to
reiterate, I
have numbers like $11
million upside down
$28 million upside
down $9 million
upside down and I can go on and
on with districts
that are struggling with their
budget. And we
mentioned this morning as representative
BCA Mr chairman, ask
about some of the
pieces parts that go
to that. I just want to reiterate
again. One of them
is that the state equalization
guarantee unit value
was established low
and I marked it at
60%
of what its part value
is of the gain you
put in. And I would
urge you as a policy
body to press that
issue. We need those
dollars in the mix
to begin to salve some
of those issues that are there
a final point
that I would make
the biggest problem, Mr
Chairman and Senator Stewart,
you touched on this is
getting kids in
school. We
lost the kids, we lost
the parents during
COVID
I I rank
as our highest problem in
New Mexico. And by
the way, in the United States
student attendance, student
absenteeism,
we have to figure out how to beat that.
Then I'm gonna come full circle back
around to superintendent
Sanchez and his team.
That's how you do
it if you
care about kids and they know
it if you engage parents and
kids and they know it,
they will come back to
school that's
happening around the state
in each district, in
many, many, many
districts, we're not
home. Please recognize
that. Thank
you. >> Thank
you. Sam.
So we have
Kurt.
>> Good afternoon, good
afternoon, Mr Chairman,
members of the LES C. My
name is Doctor Kurt
Schmidt, the Executive Director of Fine Arts
for Rear Rancho Public Schools
and also the chair of the New Mexico
Advisory Council on Arts Education,
which is a consortium of arts
educators, museum
educators and other artists.
In the LASC report, December
13th 2023.
It was stated that recognizing
elementary fine arts programs
as core foundational
experiences for
all students may justify
embedding their separate components
into the basic program
components. Consequently,
ensuring universal access
for all students and eliminating
the burden of the fine arts application
process for local
education agencies.
I'm here today on behalf of the New
Mexico Advisory Council and
Arts Education to voice
opposition to this
proposal or any proposal
that would do away with the Fine Arts
Education Act or FA
EA I also have
permission to speak on behalf of
Rear Rancho Public Schools, which
also opposes this
idea, embedding
elementary fine arts funds
in the basic program components
to, to show how important they
are is backward thinking
if the fine arts are indeed
important and are to be considered as
core subjects. Keeping
the funding out of the general SCG
formula is a better way to
ensure that the money will actually be
spent on fine arts programs.
Fine arts funds run through the
general seg will
most assuredly mean that the funds
are forgotten, lost or
used for other purposes.
Finally, the LES C report
states that fine arts that
running fine arts funding through the
general seg formula
would, would eliminate
the burden of the fine arts application
process. The LES
C should make decisions for
what is best for kids,
not for what is most convenient
for adults. Please
preserve the FE A which
for over 20 years has
served the students of New Mexico.
Well, thank you for your time.
>> All right, thank you for joining
us,
Jamie.
>> Thank you, Mr chairman, members of the committee.
My name is Jamie Trujillo. I
am the executive director
of the New Mexico Adult Education
Association. We
represent 26 adult
education and 18
adult literacy programs throughout the
state of New Mexico. I see
a lot of advocates for
adult education in this room
and judging from
all of the conversations that have been
happening today, one
thing that I do want to very
much highlight is that adult
education needs a seat at this
table as well as adult
literacy. We would very
much love the
opportunity to speak
to the committee about the
impact of
adult education and adult
literacy on all
generations in education.
And I am joined by Leah
Ellis who is one of my adult
education student
ambassadors and
a high school equivalency graduate
as of last
week.
And so I would like to give her the
opportunity to speak about the
impact of adults
education
>> and, and I will say
since you all signed up, both
you can have the four minutes.
So >> thank
you. >> Thank
you, Mr chair and members of the
committee. Um I appreciate
your time. Thank you for allowing me
space. Um
I am
well, I'm a parent and now I'm a
grandmother as well
and, and I spent two
years going to UN in Valencia
Campus
um for the
next steps adult education
program. And yes, I did
graduate
Wednesday of last week.
And I feel
now I have a
meeting with UN M
Valencia Campus
to discuss
adult well,
continuing higher education is
what you call. So
um this
journey of
getting my higher
educate. Well, oh, excuse
me, my high school
equivalency has
brought me to Jamie has brought
me to a point of
advocating
for individuals like
me, also individuals
from about the age of 16
and higher
that didn't fit in
neurodiversity.
>> Sorry, keep
going two
minutes >> and uh
neurodiversity.
Um We're going back to
school. We're
juggling family,
Children, parents,
other schools jobs the whole
nine yards. And
please,
we would love to be acknowledged.
We would love to have a dialogue.
We would love to have a discussion
about who we really
are as we are
choosing the education,
as we are choosing this
point to get a higher
education so that we
can impact our communities
in our families.
And I appreciate the time.
I appreciate joy,
Representative Garrett. Thank
you and Senator
Souls. You also
have uh been
a part in
sponsoring some of the
events that that adult
education has done. Uh
Mr Pope, uh
Senator or
Representative Baca. I would love
to have a one on one discussion
with you. I am here in Valencia
County. So
um thank you.
II, I sat
here all day and scared,
just frightened
to death.
I'm glad it's
over.
>> Well, thank you for so much for
joining us and
congratulations
again.
Um Think next we
had our pe
folks.
OK.
Yeah, I think it was by
mistake. Uh
Deborah
Deborah.
All right. Uh
Christina.
All
right,
welcome Christina. You have up
to two minutes. Thank
you, >> Chairman
Romero, members of the committee.
My name is Christina
Gonzalez and I'm the
Fine Arts coordinator in
Santa Fe Public
Schools. I'm also
a member of the New Mexico
Advisory Council on Arts
Education.
I understand that the LES
C is considering a
proposal which would
eliminate the FE
A application and
program unit
on behalf of Santa Fe
public schools. I'm here
to express our
opposition to this
proposal.
We support keeping
fine arts funding as a
program unit
and we support including the
application and
accompanying assurances
that come with
it. The
assurances of the fe
a application
require the
signatures of the
superintendent,
our business manager,
the president of our Board
of Education and a
representative of the Fine
Arts Advisory Council in our
district. In other words, a parent
or a community
member, this
provides accountability
for the use of the funding that
we receive for arts
education. It means that we
have to use the money
to teach art and
music to our
Children.
In the absence of this
assurance use of money
received will be at the
discretion of
individual leas, there
is no guarantee
that fine arts funding will
actually be used to
provide fine
arts education in schools
delivered by licensed
educators with
endorsements in visual
or performing arts.
This could have devastating
long term impacts on arts
education in New
Mexico arts
education to you L's
Point. Earlier today, it
bolsters school
engagement. It bolsters
attendance Research
is unequivocal about
this. It's a key
component of culturally
responsive instruction,
culture, art. This
is another component that we should all
be looking at together. It
improves academic success.
New Mexico is investing
in the arts in creative
industries. How
can we not also
invest intentionally
and robustly in
arts education?
>> Thank you. Thank you,
Christina. Uh
Nancy.
>> Good afternoon. Thank you
for coming. My name is
Doctor Nancy Pauley.
I'm a professor
of Emerita,
Associate Professor of Emerita
from UN M
and for 20
years, I taught art
education to prepare
art educators in the
state as well.
I worked for seven years with my
colleagues at UN M who
have a, we have a program
called TECLA. We
prepare elementary education
majors to teach all
the school subjects using
all the arts.
And we have found this to be
extremely successful
as, as some of other
members have spoken,
I I'm very
much against the removal
of the Fine Arts budget
approval process.
And I think that
the uh
the it
should not only should the
process be continued,
but there should
be um a renewed
emphasis on the
evaluation from the PE
D in 2015,
there was the last
time that a, uh,
a, uh, that
the, uh,
this is a, a
program,
it shows a program plan
and evaluation
that was done by the PE
D. It shows
you the amount of
teachers, it shows you
the proposal amounts,
it shows you what was, what
each person was given.
It shows you the PE D
was involved in
preparing teachers through
professional development
through um a three,
a conference that they offered.
And so we've
since lost
our, a person
who represents the
visual and performing arts
at the pe D.
And um there's another person
who's there now who doesn't have a
fine arts background. So
I think not only should
the, the review
process not
be discontinued,
but it must be strengthened.
Um If I still
have 0 12
seconds, I just brought kids work
in to say that I'm an advocate
for kids and this is the
kind of work we're doing at
is San Jose elementary school with
kids where they're
sharing aspects of their
identity, their future
plans, um their
history as a person and it
really sup supports
the Martinez Yazzie lawsuit
decision. This is the kind
of work we want to strengthen
as uh
uh as Christina
mentioned, right?
>> Thank you doctor
uh
Joe.
So you have to up to two minutes.
Welcome. >> Thank you.
Good afternoon, Mr chairman and
members of the committee. My name is
Joe Gershen and I'm a director
of Performing Arts in Albuquerque
Public Schools.
Uh We're opposed to this
proposal that um
removing the FE a or
changing the fe in the way it
is and keeping
the fa e funding as a program
unit. Uh moving to a
base unit would decrease the
accountability and could
decrease access for our
students. The
assurances it provides help to
ensure a quality fine arts
education for all students
and help educate the whole
child.
>> Mhm. Great. Thank you
so much.
All
Oh, we have more people
online. Um We've already
gone through online,
but this time
we'll
granted,
but for
future reference, once we go
through online, that'll
be
it.
And we need names
though.
Um
So phone number person,
if you could
identify
yourself,
feel like I'm back to
remote
teaching,
right? Um
So I'll go,
I'll start with Debbie
Debbie
Fleming, the only
Debbie on
there.
We can hear you. You have up to two
minutes.
>> Oh, thank you so much,
Mr Chair members of the committee.
Thank you so much for
letting me have this opportunity
to make public comment. My name
is Debbie Fleming.
I'm a retired educator
as well as
administrator
and I would like to speak to
you today about
um a presentation
to your co
your committee back
in the fall and
it was a presentation
dealing with funding in public
schools and a very
small part of that presentation
had to do with the Fine Arts Education
Act. And while
the comments were really wonderful
about fine arts
education and
how good they are
for kids, et cetera, that
it might even be a good idea to
consider them in terms
of making a part of the
core.
Um
One part of
that presentation talked
about maybe looking
at fa E A the Fine Arts
Education Act in a little different
way, which
would in essence,
kind of have the money
not be program
specific or designated
specifically for Fine
Arts. And so I just
kind of wanted to mention to you
some of the unintended
consequences of such a
decision and that
we've seen without
those assurances a
lot of times problems
happening with cuts to
fines and
how devastating that can be for
students and schools
and communities at
large.
And then when they
try to rebuild those programs, it
can take decades.
So I was really hoping that you would
look at that carefully and consider
some of those unintended
consequences of
changing the way finance arts
is funded. And
actually, I kind of
appealed to you to think about
strengthening um
the F DEA
and assurances
um and even
more oversight than the public
education department to
asure quality programs are delivered
with integrity
um
for our students
and for everybody. And I just thank
you so much for doing this opportunity
to
speak.
>> All right. Thank you,
Debbie.
>> Thank you.
>> All right. Uh It looks
like
Michelle
All right, Michelle, are you
there?
All right. Um I'm
seeing Nat
beside, I feel like I'm at my
optometrist appointment.
Um
Now, um I
see your microphones
on that. I can tell you have up
to two minutes. Welcome. Thank you for joining
us.
>> Thank you, Mr, chair members
of the committee. And
uh uh I'm a
little bit hobbled
in this because
uh the caping
is not on for
um legislative
education study
committee and
uh now it is on in
Zoom. So I'm a little
discombobulated.
So, uh thank you so
much. Uh Legislative
Council
Legislative Finance has
had captioning on
throughout the majority of the day,
but it's of extremely important
quality and therefore it's inaccurate
and it is auto generated
by
harmonies.slick.net
and there
has not been captioning
throughout the day for legislative
education study committee
except for a few words
here and there.
Um It is
an accessibility issue
and it is an
intermittent auditory
processing issue for
me. But my
intention is that
any kind of education
including learning throughout the
interim or throughout the session
or within a classroom or
within the world should be
a matter of equal
access and that,
that access should be as
accurate as possible because
that is the only way that we will
learn and it is the only
way we will gain access.
Um
These concerns are not
new, they are not unique
just to me and
July will in
2024 will be 34
years of the Americans With
Disabilities Act.
And I think that we can do
better. And I thank you, Mr
Chair and uh
whomever the vice chair is and
the members of the committee
for allowing me to make these
comments today because I think
it's very, very
important. And my
mother's history,
she's been gone for more
than 20 years was that
she was in special
education for more than
three decades and
began even when there was
not something termed
special education.
I'm not particularly following
in your footsteps by choice,
but I'm following your footsteps
by opportunity. We're
all temporarily able bodied
or tab. Thank you so
much. >> Thank you
for joining us uh
Michelle
Trey Michelle
again.
All right.
So that's what we have for public
comment. Thank you folks.
Everybody for joining us.
Um members remember
we're meeting in Los
Salas at the uh
Terry Ortiz Teacher resource
Center tomorrow morning,
starting at nine.
So
you can leave your binders here.
Everything else take with
you unless you don't
want it, I guess.
But see you all tomorrow.
