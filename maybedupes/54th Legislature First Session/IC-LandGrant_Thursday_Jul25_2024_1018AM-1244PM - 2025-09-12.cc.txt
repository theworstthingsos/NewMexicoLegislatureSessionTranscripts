for Northern New Mexico
College,
>> Mou Rosia Singy
Tou. Good morning. Thank you all
for joining. I, I wanted to
come in with a dramatic entrance
as you could see and be
a little fashionably late. But the
truth is I had to present at
the Riaa County Commission.
So I'm sorry and
apologize for joining you late.
And I want to thank the chairwoman, the
vice chairwoman for
stepping in and deleting
the meeting. I want to welcome
all of you to my hometown,
the beautiful Espanola Valley
and it wouldn't be the same if I
don't say I'm
proud to represent the low rider
capital of the world where
we're brown, we're down
and we're low to the
ground
so much history and
culture right here in the Espanola
Valley. And I need to do a land
acknowledgement and
remind everybody that we're standing
on the ancestral land
of the strong and
resilient Pueblo people
of the Tewa of Bo Santa
Clara and Oking
and to recognize the elders
of the past and those who are
presently with us who
can teach, continue to teach
us the way of lives even
before we were the great state
of New Mexico. And
so with that, there's two other things
is we'll be taking a cruise
in Espanola
fashion with 13
Lowrider that will be
joining us at 315.
We'll be taking a police
escorted cruise through
Espanola. So you can
say you've at least cruised once
in my hometown in the low rider
capital of the world. And I
would love to snap a photo of all
of you with your Lowrider. It's
part of our culture and
tradition of who we are as
Nortenos. And then I'd
like to congratulate
representative Joseph Sanchez
on the birth of his new
addition to the Blue
ventures.
And so congratulations,
representative on that.
And with that, I would like to turn it
over to my good
friend and president of Northern
New Mexico College,
Hector
Balderas.
How's that? Thank
you.
Well, Mr Chairman, honorable
members of this committee, let me just
give you a, a really uh
a heartfelt welcome
to, to really welcome you into
a special valley.
It's such an honor to have
uh our serious thought leaders
come into our
campus and
to allow us the
opportunity to share a little bit about what's
going on in this community.
But more importantly,
the Northern is going
through a special
uh transitional
period. And
um you all are at the forefront
of that investment.
You're all at the forefront
of whether or not
Northern truly reaches
its highest potential.
And so I wanna take this
opportunity to, to thank
you for allowing
us to share a little bit about our
perspective.
Um Honorable chair,
I also want to thank
um the
land grant committee
and also our land grant community
behind me
because uh what you're
about to discuss here
today has
so much to do with Northern
Colleges identity.
Many of our students,
uh
their foremost
most development, developmental
years come from their
own culture
and they are deeply
impacted their own identity
and their dreams
oftentimes
go through their connection
to their land and
their family. And
we want to continue to
build upon the strength of Northern.
We think we're a special
institution
because we are a cultural
community and we are a
land based
regional community.
The real question is, can we
sustain the
future of education and
really make sure that
we create
a northern campus that truly
benefits the future of
our young people. And that is
the challenge. And so I'd like to share a
couple
of ideas
and also progress
reports that I think you'll all be
pleased in because
you invest in us. And most
importantly, every day, we try to
earn your trust and we
try to earn the trust of the
community.
So as a former member of
your body, I remember 18
years ago being a, a land
grant
um committee
member under the leadership of
Chairman Garcia. Although we
didn't get to go do Lowriders,
I don't remember that 18 years
ago, but um
but I'm excited to join you on the
Lowrider today as well. So
we will, we'll have a great
time but also
as a, as a member and
also as a state auditor. I
remember those days when we were
barely funding
financial support for land
grants so that they could get
audited as they were
becoming part of
the local government
community, we were
barely fighting for
seed money so
that they could be treated uh
with the same investment and
respect that
municipalities and other
governmental entities. Those were
18 years ago, I remember
when we were having a debate
whether we were gonna fully fund
the Treaty of Guadalupe Division
at the A G's office because it had
gone unfunded and
on staff. So for so, so
many years,
so it's a real honor now to do to
join you in a new fight,
which is how do we make
sure that our educational
institutions like
Northern, not only
keep their doors open,
but that remain a viable
option for our young
people to come to
our institution and receive
culturally competent education
that relates to them.
I'm excited that our nursing
program
offers
um
areas of culture
that have to deal with
holistic healing.
I'm excited for you to later
on to hear a little bit about our educational
programs that are now
not just licensing
educators, but
really sharing uh
knowledge about our
rural way of life
and and most importantly about
trauma based learning because so
much, so many of our young people and families
are going through trauma.
So we think that we are
not just trying to keep our doors
open and we think that we
are uh
and not trying to just compete with
other institutions. We think that we
offer a unique special
education
that you can feel proud
to invest in our
institution. And that every
four corners of our, all our
four corners of our, of our
state uh
needs this type of
relevant education our
trades education.
We're starting to explore
uh blending with our religion
and our culture and our eco
diversity. We don't
wanna just teach welding and
shop. We want to teach the
cultural relevancy
and how ironic that you're
investing in eco
tourism of the future.
Well, we believe the weavers
and the carpenters and
the artists
will come through some of our
programs. And
the question is, will we get funding
to teach them how to be good
entrepreneurs,
how to pay taxes,
how to market in social
media? These are all the new
challenges that
the legislature
is gonna be critical
to investing in some of our special
programming.
So the overview of Northern when
I got here about
a year and a half ago
was that um
they were very transparent,
they gave me the keys and they said there are many
challenges.
Uh Northern uh is
an institution that is
resilient
but has also gone through some,
some challenges that have
really deeply impacted
the esteem of the
community.
And I didn't believe
that uh
that the
community deserved an
institution that
potentially was declining
in enrollment
or reducing their
courses or
not rebuilding their
infrastructure. I thought, you know
what, we're gonna take this fight
to the state so that Northern
can receive their fair share of
funding and that we
can lay out a vision that you
can all be proud of. That we know is
so relevant to rebuilding
and transforming the economy. Of New
Mexico.
So for instance,
uh northern had not had a clean
audit in over 10 years.
This is the first year that we've
earned a clean audit and we went
from 26 findings to
six findings.
Thank you. You give
us a round of applause for my staff
back there. I so I'm very
proud
we take fiscal account of duty
very seriously because we know we have
to prove to you that
we are going to invest that
entire dollar
to the benefit of our students
and our business leaders
and our thought leaders in the
region. Uh
So not only do we go from
26 findings down to
six. We
believe that we are
promoting uh asset
protection. We, we had
numerous leaking roofs
throughout this institution.
Uh Over 10 of our
buildings were
critically in dire need
of not only roofing but
heating and cooling.
Uh You gave us one of the most
substantially large capital
outlay investments.
And as you can see, we've got new
parking lots where we can park those
lowrider, Mr Senator.
Um our
students deserve to have
the state of the art
classrooms
and facilities. And we think
that we're gonna deliver not only in
person but online
education.
Uh that as you
uh expand wireless
and broadband in our rural
communities, we think we're
gonna be a critical hub that is
prepared to educate the student
where they're at. So
if uh uh uh
Santa Clara
mother wants to stay
on the pueblo
and take a course. We believe
that we are headed in a
direction where we're gonna have
those campuses go to
those communities. And that's gonna be
very innovative and excited.
We're working with our accrediting
bodies right now where
we are in Espanola High School,
we hope to be in the Pueblos and
offer these courses.
As many of those students don't
want to leave their families or they have
daily responsibilities. And so
this is the, the
exciting innovative conversation
that we're having.
Um,
also, as
you know, and I've been reading all the
articles you're
tracking
whether higher education
is
really
doing a great job at
keeping our New Mexico
students in New Mexico
institutions. That's a very
aggressive debate that the legislature
is having. And
I'm pleased to tell you that,
um,
that since I
got here
in the fall semester, we saw
12% enrollment
growth, which is actually
number two with our
peers, we're
beating our peers. We're
not trying to be like our peers
or compete with our peers.
But that was the first semester that
we sent a strong message
that we are gonna compete
for dollars, higher ed
dollars that we think
we can do a better job than
some of our other peer institutions
in the communities.
The second semester, we went up
to an enrollment increase by
19%
that tells you that the narrative
we're hearing that families
that are even in poverty and in
trauma are not excited
to send their students to
college is a
false narrative.
They are. In fact, if you're a victim
of crime or you're in poverty,
you're probably a better
student. We just have to
meet you
at your corridor and
provide the skills so that you
succeed in those classrooms. The
motivations
are are
aggressive if
we honor them and respect them
with their culture and we understand their
heritage and we speak
their language. Sometimes
I speak much and much is not
a uh a secondary
language up here. This
is our sometimes our primary
language, but it's done
with respect in a way we can
connect with our community that
they're valuable.
Finally, the third semester
this summer, when they say
kids don't want to go to summer
school, we're up
31%
in enrollment growth.
And I will tell you as we're fixing
up the buildings and the parking lots
and a year investing in our
programs.
Really, I believe that our
retention strategy is that
we make students feel
valued here
and they feel safe
and connected
and that we really wanna partner
with their dreams. And I think
that's the, the, we owe
that credit to the faculty
and staff
who often choose to
work here because we can't compete
with the wages in Los Alamos.
We can't compete with the Un
MS and the Santa
Fe Community Colleges.
And so as we present
little future
ideas about potentially
wage equity for
us, um
ideas that will
allow us to catch
up to those institutions
with technology
and infrastructure, we hope
that um
as we have an amazing
local delegation,
uh I can't think enough
the leaders that we
have who are strong
advocates.
Uh But in addition to
seeking their advocacy,
we really believe
Northern can
offer an education that's
relevant to a kid in
Deming or a
kid in Roswell
because we think that
we're addressing the teacher
shortage and the nursing
shortage not to compete
with CNM. Or UN M.
But we believe that the students
that are falling out of those
systems can
absolutely succeed in our
program and we're going after
those students, but it will
require some special investments
from, from legislative
bodies like this,
that supplement some of
our extra services that
we call wraparound services
to, to make that single
mother in Clovis
who's in a nursing
program,
um feel
unique, special and
supported. But
the payoff is amazing uh
at the last graduation and I'd like
to uh introduce and turn it
over the rest of the presentation to
my uh academic
department. But I'll leave you with this story.
Um I've
spoken, I've hosted two
graduations here
and um
as you said, we're fighting a
reputation that
Espanola can
be a world-class
uh community
to raise your family.
Uh We're battling
opiate addiction. We're battling
many, many social ills
that you've all been
uh facing
with us for so many
decades. But
what's an amazing identity
is on graduation?
We uh probably are the
only graduation that literally
does the Mara
walking out with our
students, the community
does the Mara with the
graduates. And
um but it was
amazing to see
students from all over the
state of New Mexico that
were on our online
programs.
Um Native American
students, Anglo students
from Clovis Filipinos
that were finishing a master's
degree uh
to, to come down to ground
zero in Espanola
and, and walk the
graduation
shows that what you're investing in
Northern is special, but
also can actually
be a solution for some
of the challenges that you're all
facing uh in
designing the next
workforce for New Mexico.
We all want to get off those
lists together and
we think that Espanola
will, will be a place that we're
not just trying to clean
our act up,
but that we could be
the attractive
valley that New
Yorkers and Californians
want to, to learn about
the mystery of our history
truly can be a place that we can
safely get a job or raise a
family. So with
that, um I'd like to
introduce my vice president.
I, we're gonna do a great
job at starting ending
at 11 because
we want you on time for
the 11 o'clock
presentation and
I want to make sure you're fed on time
as well at noon. I'm
gonna challenge my vice
president
um
Larry Guerrero. And if
Sando Rias and Frank
Loera and Joe Paia, could they come up
as well? I want to introduce
them.
Um Doctor
Guerrero is a, is a Texan.
Don't hold that up against him.
Um We stole
him from the
valley
and uh he does a phenomenal
job. Doctor Sandra
Rodri Rodriguez is
the chair of our education department.
Doctor Frank Loera is leading
our trades revolution
and his understudy
is also uh Joseph
Padilla and he's our
technical trades chair. So I'll
defer to you, but we're a little
pressed for time. Because I don't, I don't
wanna go over the 11.
Mr chairman.
Go ahead.
>> Thank you, President Balderas. Uh
And thank you committee for allowing
us to, to speak and visit.
So uh just real
quick, uh the great things
uh about northern New Mexico,
of course, is it just excites
me to talk about this?
But uh a couple of things, number
one, we, we
offer uh an
opportunity to obtain a
bachelor's degree
and associate's degree.
And uh but also more importantly,
we offer an opportunity to offer
trades, technical
certifications and license.
And so those are some of the wonderful
things that, that we have an opportunity
to offer our students.
Most importantly as well
is that a student
can come and get either a trades
and associate's or bachelor's
and they can get all three
or one of the three and they
can actually reduce the amount of
cost uh in their,
in their livelihood. And
so they, they, they would reduce the
amount of student debt.
So the other thing
too, when I was first hired, I
started in this, in this position
back in January. And so
I've had an opportunity to walk
the campus and, and meet a lot of
great people. But more
importantly, I also live in
the city of Espanola, which
means that I've got an opportunity to
walk the, the, the streets and
the sidewalks and go to Walmart
and speedway and go to these low rider
shows and I get a
chance to, to, to encompass
myself with a lot of great people.
So it's helped me establish
what we're trying to work on here in
Northern. So let me go
ahead and get started.
So some of the things that we want to
talk about is our students
success. And so back
in 2020 we, uh we
were challenged with a um
with assurance review that they
said we need to work on several things
and we need to make some improvements
as we move forward.
So some of the things that we did
of course is we created what's called
a student Success Academy.
And within that student success
academy, we had to look at a
different uh a lot of different
variables that we want to try
to improve, such
as our DFW
rates in the past,
they were fairly high. And so
we found ways to reduce these
DFW rates.
And we did this, of course by
offering more co requisite
classes in math and co
requisite classes in English to
help a lot of our students who didn't
do well on the acu
placer. The other thing of course
is we did a better job of transfer
articulation. So if students wanted
to transfer into Northern, we
accepted a lot of the general education
classes in some of the content
areas uh for their
degrees and they graduate
on time or sooner. If
anything else, we
looked at some of the overall
obstacles that were
preventing our students from
students success
such as, and I thought
this was important,
but we created a
food and clothing
pantry for our students
because if our students are
hungry or cold,
how are they going to learn, how
are they going to concentrate in the
classrooms? And so our
food pantry has really
increased and we give
out a lot of food and the
kids accept it and it's
made them better students when it's
cold, we give them some
coats, we give them
jackets. And so these are
things that I noticed that some of our
students were missing or lacking.
And I thought it was important to include
on this. The other thing, of
course, this is counseling. We offer
more mental health counseling
coming off of COVID. We
offer better counseling services.
We have an L PC on campus
and we have a lot of referrals.
We we work with disability
services. And of course,
lastly, we actually
focus on customer service.
We think customer service is so
very important outside
the classroom. So those are some things.
The other thing is, of course, building
stronger foundations
to Enno to enable our
growth. We
placed the right people
in the right place this
spring semester has been very challenging
because we've had a lot of shifts.
But it's almost like coaching a,
coaching a baseball team. I
hate to use that analogy, but I'll use
it anyway. But you almost
have to find out who your
leadoff hitter is, who your starting
pitcher is, who your cleanup
hitters. We have to find
the right people and put those
personnel in the right positions and
that's paid off tremendously for
us. The other thing too,
we grow our own. We've
noticed that we've had some graduates from
Northern and we are growing
our own to put those same people in
positions where they're leaders.
Uh And of course, the, the last
couple of things, we've increased our
professional development
and we, as the president said,
we're now starting to balance our face
to face classes along with our
online offerings,
our academic focus, of course,
uh, we have two departments
that you'll hear from just a minute.
Uh Business administration,
which is our, our, our and teacher
education, two of our
stronger uh programs
that we have right now. We
also, of course, are
increasing in our technical
trades. We've added
another program called Career and
Technical Education, which you'll hear
from both of these gentlemen. In just a
minute, we've reached
out to a lot of the service,
uh, high schools that we service,
uh we've, we've increased our
dual credit
uh offerings for a lot of our high
schools and we're gonna continue to
increase. And of
course, uh we're, we're
increasing in continuing
education pathways,
certifications. And of course,
we're offering now badges
uh here to a lot of our
students.
So in saying all that
we put all of this together,
it's taken a spring semester
because when I first arrived, we had a
lot of great things,
but we just did not have
operational direction.
Now with the assistance
of the president and the support of the
president and the things that he's helped
us do, we now have
a great operational direction.
So if you look on the top left,
we'll start with our academic
affairs, our trades
programs, we've increased
there. We've improved
our student services by offering
a one stop shop
that the president has of course
helped implement in
academics. We're working on program
reviews to improve our
course offerings and the
way we teach our courses,
we have the student success and
uh academy which is our
quality initiative which we
focus on students.
We are currently building a
brand new strategic plan
which will be ready to present
to the president in about a month.
And so we'll have that
prepared but look
at our retention and graduation
rates. This is what
the president was at was pretty
much talking about when he
said, hey, not
only are we bringing in students,
but we're keeping our students and
we're graduating our students at
55% and
33%
respectively. So
all of this that we talk about
operational direction, it all
leads to one thing and one thing that
we're focused on is student
success.
So as we move
forward, the president did
talk about some data, look at
some of these numbers
uh ever since the president
has taken office, and I'll give you
more details of what it looks
like on this next
slide.
So if you look at the slide up
on the screen, you'll
see that the president
started in the
spring of 23.
And so he had
1025 students.
But if you compare that up the
scale from the spring of
22 there was
932
students that
same summer, the
president under his guidance,
we have 305 students
back then. If you
compare it to the summer
of 22 it's
256
and then everything speaks for
itself. Fall semester,
spring semester again,
summer semester have all
shown that our enrollment has increased
tremendously uh over
the last several years.
Uh You see the bottom number fall,
that's where we currently sit. And of
course, we are adding students
every single day. So
our numbers will be better uh be
back up. And of course, in
August,
how do we compare against some of
the other regional schools? Again,
there's a lot of great institutions
here in the State of New
Mexico, whether they're a community
college or four year schools. But how do
we comparing graduation and
retention? Those are the
numbers that are that show
with respect to graduation
and retention rates. So, having
a 55% and
33%
graduation retention rates
is very, very respectable
in higher
education.
The last thing I want to talk about and
then I'll turn it over to my all-star
cast that I brought over here. Of
course, I'd like to talk about
the important things of why we're
also here. Workforce
education and academic
affair departments.
So I'll just kick it off because
she's out of the state right now.
But, um, our nursing uh
department chair, uh
I'll share the information with
nursing and how well we're doing
with just something as simple as
health care, which is so very
important. Notice
that they almost mimic
each other. In the spring
of 23
we had 11
graduates.
The employment rate was
100%.
The retention rate was
54%.
But even more impressive.
Look at the number of the
first time they take the
inlex RN
people that is a very
difficult test to take
and pass the first
time we
get counted for
or against on the very
first time that students take the
test. If they
pass it the first time, we look
great if they don't pass
it the first time. We don't
look so great. But guess what?
They're all passing at the very
first time. So, in the spring of
23 we were 11 for
11. Look, in the
spring of 24 we just
graduated another 11
nursing students. And
as of right now, we are sitting
at 10 out of 11
have passed the Inlex uh
RN. The other
one hasn't taken the test yet. So we're
waiting for this last one to take the test.
So hopefully we'll be back at a, at
100%.
Yeah, no pressure there.
So, aside
from that, I'd like to turn it over to
my all-star cast, uh,
and, uh, and just allow
them to go and speak on their
departments.
>> I am Sandra Rodriguez from
the education department.
I did, I
have a handout
which you should have. So I'm not
gonna go through the numbers or
anything, but I just want
to point out a couple of things
and when we talk
about enrollment for
education a couple of years
ago, our enro um, our
enrollment has grown almost
100% which is,
it doubled in, in about
three years. So
that speaks to
um, many things
and, and one of the ones that I
think a lot of it has to do
with is having
online programs.
We have students as I look
around and see the, the,
uh, counties that you represent.
We have students in every one of
those counties right
now. In addition
to the, our, our
biggest group is
here from Espanol, Espanola
Rio,
but we service all the other
counties. So,
um, those again
are, are numbers,
I won't go through them, like I
said, but, um,
the graduation rates are
also have,
uh, increased
dramatically for the
education department.
We say in our
department that if you
come in, we're gonna
hound you to, you graduate.
So that is really a good
thing because we get to know our
students very
well and, um,
and they're comfortable with this
and so that it's working
what, you know, and it has to do
with the wrap around services
that we provide them
whatever we do we try to do
in house. So on
the, well, in fact,
probably 99% of
our students work,
they get employed
before they ever
graduate and
once they graduate, they
have choices of where they're gonna
go. So,
um it speaks
to the quality of the program
and it speaks to the
quality of the student
to the student. One of
the things that President Baretta
says, we have to meet the
students where they're
at
that is key.
The other piece that I want to
show is the very last
page and it has to do with
the funding.
Uh The last one, the education
department HED has
been providing
a scholarship
to the um higher
ed, to the Colleges of
Education around New Mexico
for about 344
years. It's the teacher preparation
affordability scholarship.
Those numbers that you see
and that we have is for last
year, the
79
77 79
students that are here.
Those are students for one
reason. Or another, do
not qualify either for the
opportunity scholarship
or other funding
that money. So
we can say that those
79
students,
it's very probable
they wouldn't be here.
They're getting this
additional funding
we use primarily
for alternative license.
Individuals who are
coming in that already have a
degree and they wouldn't
qualify for any type
of FFA or
the opportunity scholarship
or, you know, for whatever
the reasons are, they're maxed out
or anything else. So
that kind of funding
is critical for our
students. These students
come to us
uh with their
dreams, with their
dreams.
So if we're able
to support that,
that's all they need. And
it turns a family
around, it turns
a family's
um trajectory
around.
So I if
you know, if I say nothing else,
that type of additional
funding that isn't tied
to 100
different uh
criteria that keeps
them off of the list is
critical for our students.
It's critical.
Thank
you.
No, this one is
that
>> good morning. Uh Again,
my name is Laurie Baucham, the chair
for the Department of Business
Administration. Uh
This is the handout I put
together,
I won't go. Um
you know, you guys can read this
but um
uh real simple,
we're um a faculty
of four for
business uh that
includes myself. So three
and, and myself.
Uh we do have another um
position uh
vacant. Uh
So we need to fill that.
Um There's an organizational
chart there and it
shows,
um,
business,
um, faculty and
it shows cosmetology and
barbering, faculty
and cosmetology and Barbering
are under the Department of
Business also.
Um, the next
page we offer
many, uh, we
offer three
bachelor's degrees,
accounting management, project
management. We offer
associate's degrees,
both, uh
AAA A and A as.
So, one's a terminal
degree and one's, uh,
one,
it's a stepping block
to a bachelor's
degree. And we
offer many, uh,
certificate
programs
under the cosmetology and
barbering programs. We offer
a as and
um, cosmetology and one
in barbering. And
we offer certificates
also in both
programs.
The business
side is accredited
by A CBS
P and
that's a accreditation council
for business schools and
programs. We got a credit
in 2015
and we're up again now in
2025.
Uh The
Barbarian and Cosmetology
side is,
um, they're licensed for
the State of New
Mexico.
Uh, what I wanted to
show you is,
um, our
programs used to take four years
to complete and most used to
complete them in six.
We have shortened it
down to
um,
32 months.
And, uh I'm happy
to say that we have 76
graduates this, uh,
this spring
and they were
associates
certificates, uh,
bachelor's.
So we have
76. So the
number keeps on growing for
our department.
Also, enrollment
has been growing
and um, part of
it is we've gone online
for most programs.
So we have students
from
even different States.
So, so
it's been, it's been pretty
good. Uh what I want to
show you the reason why we were
able to shorten
things uh quite
a bit for our
students
is that we offer
um courses online
and
uh the tuition is 300
a credit hour. So that
includes everything.
So it's, it's pretty
inexpensive.
But uh what we
started doing is we
offer um uh
and I'm just giving an
example of the last three
pages I
think.
But the certificate,
uh for project management
has like five classes.
So students can start here.
They take these five
classes,
they can go on
to get an associate's
degree,
which if you look at
the, um,
it's called Bachelors of
Business Administration.
But if
you look at it,
the associate's degree
ends on the second
page.
So they
do that pretty
rapidly. And that's with the
gen ed and then
the Bachelor's is,
um, the last
page. But if you
see the certificate, the
ones with the lines,
that's where we put this
certificate courses
in. So
it speeds everything up.
The other thing we did is we took
16 week courses and we
made them into eight week
courses
and not losing the, the
quality of, of the
education. It, it
just speeds it
up
and students um,
can take
classes between 12
and 18 credit hours for the
same amount of money.
So you better believe they're
taking three,
first, eight weeks, three,
second, eight weeks so
that they get their
full 18 weeks,
um, 18 credit hours
in there and they're
graduating a lot faster
than what they were in the past.
And, um,
we do partner with,
uh, workforce
development. They help
us out with some tuition
sometimes. Um,
they help the students out.
Um, we partner
with Lano. Uh A
lot of our students are
working over there. A lot
of our students are working
here. Um, One of my
students, uh
and I could name a lot of them but
uh she's a register of the
college right now.
So uh they
get good jobs.
Um We also
partner with uh UN
M and uh New
Mexico State University
to offer classes
that maybe we're
not offering this semester.
But we share an instructor.
So we save money there and
we give the students what they need
to, to move on
at a faster pace.
And we partner with many
State
county,
um a lot of businesses
and we do internships
with some businesses
and uh we
go for grants
sometimes.
Um Thank
you. Do you have any questions for
me?
Thanks.
How about if we move? So that Frank,
and I think
so.
>> There might be a slide under
that.
No, it's not there. Ok.
We'll speak
well. Uh Good morning
Frank Louetta here with the trades
department. You know,
um I've been
here for four years. It started
in 2020 about in July
2020. And at that
time, the
college had uh
uh initiated
a trade department on mill levy
and funded it and
so forth and, and
we started what's called a
uh uh uh
plumbing and Pipefitters
Center of Excellence at that
time. Um
Great project.
Um We
partnered with the
uh union the local
412
and we wrote an
mou and
we started training
apprentices
co training with the
union. Um
It's a program that the
412 had with Central
New Mexico College previously,
but
I don't know what happened there,
but we, we ended up, you know,
negotiating with the union and we
got that contract
with them and
we, we continue that uh
up until today, we're still uh
registering their students.
Um We have students
from all over New Mexico
uh all over the
southwest.
Um We have a location
in Albuquerque. Um
That's a Northern New
Mexico additional
location
um uh
registered to the Higher Learning
Commission in Los
Alamos. That's shifting here to
Espanola soon.
Um You know, we started
with our first year, we
started with 100 and 30
studentss. Uh We
have a dozen
adjuncts done uh
with the union
that we monitor,
we supervise and we,
we vet and we make sure
that they meet the standards
of uh the academics
that the higher learning commission and
HED
requires.
Um, last
year we had 204
apprentices in that
program.
Um And uh we're
looking to be about the same this
year. Retention rate is about
80% from
our first cohort. Our first
cohort, our retention rate was
about 65%.
We've been, we've been able to, to,
to go up on that.
So we're, we're about 80%
retention rate with these students out
there and, and guess what each one of
them is employed.
So to this, to, to,
since, since the end of the last
semester, we've run 598
students through that program.
And uh so that's a lot
of employment out
there throughout the
Southwest region, mostly
New Mexico through
the industrial labs and,
and private employers
either uh
50
signature contractors
that we engage with,
with, with the, with the
union.
That's one of our programs,
you know, we also have
uh our concentration
programs we have at El
Rito and here in
Espanola,
um we have students, we
train here and
at El Rito and we've, we've developed
labs up there now, what's
going on with those students?
Well, they take
two or three courses and they get
hired, you know,
and, and, and, and sometimes
we don't see them back,
but sometimes we'll see them
again at the union because they'll
join a contractor
that's affiliated with the union and
guess what? They're back in our
program.
So, so
that, that, that does help with returning
there as well.
Now, we have this
great
area
here,
rural area. It's
hard to recruit.
So it's hard to get students to
come driving from
Guyana to
Espanola to Rito. So
guess what we're doing,
you know, Joe
myself
and
Marvin, uh and
Dean and
lasagna, we drive out
to the high schools,
we go out there and we teach your high
school students out here
as well. So we
have a really good dual
credit program out in the high schools.
We're teaching trades,
we're building labs, we're helping
them
uh
this week. Uh Dean
Moya, helping Gallina
install AC NC plasma
laser up there.
We've got one up here Espinola
Valley. Um
We drive out to Jemez Pueblo,
we're Atatoa Charter
as well
and, and we drive out
there and we teach, we're, we're the
original mobile unit out
here.
Um
So, you know, and that,
that's, that's
that's for recruitment. That's, that's
bring them up, let's
get them, you know, let's get that
workforce
built up again because
the trade workforce is
really, really
falling. We, we need these
trades people out there.
You know, you can't call a plumber out
here and,
and expect them to be out
here for a month and then they charge
you, you know, $500
trip fee. Right. So,
so we really need
trades people in this area.
Um We have
relationship with
Lael as
well. Um We, we're starting
a couple of new programs and maybe
Joe can talk to you about that. The,
the MC three and IC
program.
>> Yeah. So currently, uh we've
got our instructors,
um they just
got their license to
teach the MC three program.
So what the MC three program
is, it's a pre
apprentice direct
entry uh
certificate that they
get and uh upon
completion of this MC
three, they can
enter a union of
their choice.
So, right now,
you know, Lano had an
open call for 50
laborers. We
had the mobile training
unit that was here on campus.
It went to Taos, it went to a
lot of rural communities.
All these graduates are
employed at Lano right
now
from
uh December to
now they've probably
picked up close to
60
employees at Lano.
Um And they don't just stop
as labors. Um
The plumbing and pipe
fitting, uh local
412 picks them
right up once Lano picks
them up, gives them the training, gets
their clearance paperwork
in, they pick
them up right after that, but they
do give them that work experience
and income during their
first six months as a
labor,
uh MC
three is being run
currently through that mobile
unit all over the rest of the
state right now. Um
So it's
being that it's a direct
entry for pre apprentice.
I mean, our students
come through us, they
get
MC three certification.
Plus they follow a pathway
whether it wants to be, whether they
want to be electrical plumbing
and pipe fitting. Uh
We're in the process right now
of a carpentry
program.
We completed some carpentry
camps over the summer.
Uh We just completed
a pre apprentice
lineman boot camp
that uh ended
on Friday of last
week. So, you
know, we, we're, we're trying to
get trades back
into northern New Mexico.
Uh just because we feel like
it's um feel
like it's dying, working with your
hands is important
and it's one of the top paying jobs
right
now.
>> 11 other activity
we do. We, we work contracts
for the state uh
um uh
energy
and,
and Natural
Resources
and
Minerals
Department.
Uh We do, they
just call us to, to take on
four more training sessions and
we'll do that, of course.
Um We work
with the
uh the state as well, you
know, through subcontracts. Um,
we're gonna,
we have a good chat and in
this uh uh hydrogen
Electrostatic uh
pilot uh project
going up at the rental campus,
that's gonna be a pretty neat
thing. Um,
so stay
tuned, uh,
for the broadcast on that.
We're hoping that comes pretty
soon. So we
do a lot of training, uh, non
credit credit with
the unions and,
and uh, we're just,
uh, we started with
uh one and we're up
to about five instructors. I'll
jump. Yes. Yeah.
So we're, we're, we're
still
growing.
Thank >> you, gentlemen.
Is there any questions uh
for us? >> So thank
you for that. And there are questions
and I'm gonna start off with
Senator
Stefanik.
>> Thank you very much for the
presentation from the whole
college. I really appreciate
it and I appreciate
receiving the statistics
for the different programs. The
nursing program has
great um
success. You
know, I was just thinking when you
talked about the boot camps,
I bet some
members of the public would
come if you would
advertise it to the public. Like
when you mentioned a boot camp for
carpentry. I
thought there's probably
a lot of us who would sign up for
something like that. And I know
it's not towards a certificate
or anything, but you might
keep that in mind and see if
that fits into any of your
plans. But thank
you very much. Every all of
you for the presentation
today.
>> Thank you, Senator Representative
Lord.
>> Sorry, I gotta remember how to press the
button here. Thank you.
So I don't
know if you're working with the lab at all.
But how my husband got started
in becoming a nuke engineer
is they had a rad tech
program and I don't know if
they've approached you like,
OK, so an entry level
of something and then what they did
out in Idaho
was they supported
his master's degree.
So it took him 12 years, but he
worked with a family
and that might be something that's really good
for people that they can start on
that level. You do the trades. I'm all about
the trades and they need people up there right
now because they're switching
from one form of stuff to
another. And
um but also rad
tch and working with them to
see if they do the same thing they do at
Inel, which was
to pay for their schooling
while they get their master's degree
new for somebody who wants to move
forward would be great for you
guys in this community. Thank you. It's
all I have to say. >> Thank
you. Thank you.
Thank you.
We do have a Rad Tech program
that's run through our BCE S
department.
Um, and
we work with them pretty closely.
Um, we do get
uh some funds from Lael, of
course, and, and that supports
the rad tech uh initiative
and, and Lael does
make sure that trades gets
a bit of that as well.
We have a proposition with,
in, with them right now for a similar
program as a rad tch
but uh with through the
trades more, more trade,
skilled trades oriented
and uh
it's, we, we've got
some good bites.
Yeah. Yeah. Thank
>> you. Thank you,
Representative
Garcia.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
Thank you for the
presentation.
>> Garcia. >> Thank
you. Anyway, thank you, Mr
Chairman. Thank you for the presentation.
Uh uh
President, you said you
had uh from 26
findings down to six.
You know, that's very important because,
you know, come down to
funding.
That's the first thing I'm gonna be asking
you is how
are your audits?
And if you have bad audits
where you're not working on them that
takes you every funding. And
you know, and I'm really impressed
on what you said,
what all of you have said about
what's going on in this college.
And we need to make sure as a
committee that we
keep on supporting rural
New Mexico because
a lot of times funding
goes,
Albuquerque, Santa Fe Las
Cruces and
that's not a fair judgment.
But it happens more than what
we think it does. And,
but, you know, we, we need to work
on that, you know, and what
really impressed me on this whole
meeting is the
people here. You
know, I attend a lot of meetings and
sometimes you have five or six
people, you know,
you have a full house of people
here that goes to show
everybody that they're
interested in the community
and they're interested in their land
grants. And that's very,
very important to show for
because at the end of the day, if you don't
show it, people kind of
say, well, they're not very interested in
it. So you know that
just a comment and I don't need no
address or anything. But you know,
my hats off to you
gentlemen, for what you're doing
for the students in New Mexico.
That's, that's awesome. It really
is. And you know, like I said,
we need to keep on supporting
rural New Mexico
because if that goes away,
you know, a lot of things go away with
it, your culture goes away, you
lose your land grants. You
know, your kids don't know
how to speak Spanish
anymore, you know, and that,
that's very important. Thank you for
the time, Mr, thank >> you.
Thank you for those comments. Representative
Senator Pinto.
>> Thank you, Mr, chair members of the committee.
Thank you for the work. You
do
the students that are
online. Have
they expressed any challenges
from their end of
um of, of
getting their work done
as far as the online
classes.
>> Uh Well, the, the
not necessarily,
um you know, like I said, if there's
power outages those types
of things that happen in their
communities, uh they
contact us via, you
know, cell phone or another means
uh to make sure that they may have
a little bit of extra time in order to,
to do their homework. But
typically, um you know, we
have three large programs right
now that are 100% online, the
Business Administration, our
BS N and then a teacher
education program. And
so that's one of the requirements
that we make sure that they have plenty of
broadband uh Wi
Fi and make sure that they're, you know,
exac uh available
and just to also make sure that if
anything comes up, they
notify us immediately and we
work with the students. So we really
haven't found too many
issues or problems with,
with our online programs.
But thank you for asking
>> Mr chair members of the committee.
So does the school
assists like with
laptops or any
assistance as far as
um do you have to
subscribe for, for
internet? Because in some
areas, affordability
is not?
>> Yeah. Well, I mean, when
the students are on our campus, they
certainly can utilize our Wi
Fi, of course, and we have, we've
extended our broadband
significantly.
But, but aside from
that, no, we, we don't provide
computers. I would love to get to that
point because we, I've done
that in another institution where we can
actually offer uh you
know, chrome notebooks uh
during a freshman
orientation. And uh
that that would be another funding
model that we could look into as
well. But I think that's very
important because if we're looking to
mix hybrid, high
flex and face to face classes,
I think it's important that they actually
have the availability of
a chrome notebook, but also
some Wi Fi as
well. >> And Mr
chair members of the committee
and uh you know,
especially for our colleges in the
state of New Mexico in higher
education because
I'm starting to
see other
schools coming
in that are out of state
schools. So I'm really,
I don't know how we, you know,
can really keep our,
our, our schools, uh
I guess some loyalty,
but thank you. Thank you for
all that. You do.
Thank you, Mr Chair. >> Thank you,
Senator Representative
Miguel Garcia, who I call the
godfather of land grants in
this
committee.
>> Um Thank
you, Mr Chair. Um
you know, excellent, excellent
presentations by
your staff,
excellent work.
Um You
know, you're kind of a, a
pacesetter
and kind of really
ingenious
when it comes to
building institutions
and, and we're very
grateful that you
kind of professionalized
our
Treaty Guada
Argo Division by
putting full time staff in
there.
Um Three
years ago, the
former county manager for
Rio Rio County
did a presentation in
A BCU for the
we met there at the A B land
grant. She mentioned
some things that were real
crucial.
She mentioned
that basically,
uh Los
Alamos
was creating a workforce
drain
in the
Espanola Valley.
And uh I thought
that had merit
and I thought, and I'm
willing to kind of pursue it
legislatively if it's through
memorials or whatever.
But
Lano is
siphoning off
a workforce from this
valley and
leaving a lot of positions
unfilled.
And thus,
some of these institutions
be a public or
private businesses
are kind of
functioning.
Uh Agata,
you know, limping.
And uh I
thought, you know, it's
unfortunate that the county manager
is no longer with the county.
She was outstanding.
You know, I really regret her
leaving because she really
had a head on her shoulders
for the Bien
Bien de La Gente.
And you
know, and what is to
keep the community
and the state from
holding Los Alamos
accountable in
terms of siphoning off our
workforces
in our communities
by creating
some type of program
where they
fund
where, where the
community establishes,
where the voids are,
where the needs are,
where the vacancies
are and present
a proposal to LANO
to fund those
positions.
And if it takes a four year
course, a four year
program at your
institution, a two year
program, a certification
program, so be
it. But also hold
that Landel accountable
in terms of doing
kind of a bonus
pay for these
individuals that are, that are
now certified that are willing
to go into the workforce
that's been
decimated
by Landel,
you know, creating a
bonus, a hiring
bonus of what
2000, 3000,
4000, you know, I
think that's
equitable,
you know, and I'm willing to work with
you, Hector, you know,
in terms of maybe
establishing that kind of
relationship with Lano
doing some type, some, some
type of legislative
action to draw
attention to that. But I
think it's crucial,
you know, and actually a lot
of us in the legislature
don't talk about
this mainly because some
of us have ties to Lano,
you know, and,
uh but that's one
thing, the other thing
is, is opioid settlement
monies. You were
instrumental. I worked
with you in terms of putting in the
first legislation
that the opioid settlement
money is not being
distributed
on an equitable
basis,
you know, to the targeted
population who are
substance
users
right now. LFC
basically determines
where this funding goes
to this funding
is not general fund money,
it's opioid settlement
money for substance
users, this is money
for the substance
user,
but yet the substance
user has no say in
terms of how to use that
money. The
state says, well, we're
gonna put up this program
for treatment for abatement,
for recovery,
but totally void of
input by the substance
user. You
know, and what
if the substance user was
empowered in terms of,
look, this is your money, how would
you like to use
it and something
you say, well, you
know, Majita,
you know, trying to get
this or that,
let's put it towards that.
You know, I, I think that's
what we need to do in terms of
breakthrough with the opioid settlement
money is to kind of
think outside the box
in terms of how we're expanding
it. And even though
we're doing a fairly good
job now
because at the beginning,
we weren't doing a good job.
The LFC
and the, the appropriation
committees at the
first shot, put $20
million into the opioid
settlement. 11
million of that brother was
not for the, the,
the, the settlement
agreement for
abatement for treatment and
recovery. It went
to different departments of the state
for childcare that had nothing
to do with substance
users.
11 million of the 20 million
out the window,
you know, and uh
and I raise this because,
you know about the settlement
monies, you brought
it because of you that we
have the tens of millions of
dollars in opioid settlement
monies.
So I don't want to take up any
more time, but I really would
like to kind of
you know, uh work offline,
offline with the, with the
president on these two
issues. You know, and I think
that, that he's up
to it in terms of really pursuing
it because he's that type of a
person
that is community oriented
and trying to do the right thing for the
right reason. That's
just,
>> and just a few comments for me. I
was really impressed by the numbers
president to see the graduation
rates increase
the number of enrollment.
Um That's amazing to
see our gem right here in the
Espanola Valley and
congratulations to you
and your staff. And
so for those of you out there, I want
to give you my ties to Northern
New Mexico College.
It was 1/4 great
uncle who donated the property
in El Rito for the normal
school and championed
for the then um
territory legislature
to ensure that Northern
communities got their
own in, to
educate them to become
teachers. And so then
they went back into their small
communities to become
teachers, to educate
the kids in the small
villages around northern New
Mexico. My dad
was a custodian of Northern
New Mexico College
and I remember he'd come home and
these, this was in the eighties when there
were chalkboards. And the
last thing he would do when he cleaned
was erase those
uh chalkboards because
all of that great intellect
that went into solving
problems that were on a
chalkboard, he
felt bad erasing it.
So I stand here as a
proud son of a custodian of
Northern and I stand here
as a senator. And I often
wonder what he would think to
know that his son was representing the
Espanola Veli. I
then became the first cheer
coach of Northern New Mexico
College and led a group
of students who,
who were dynamic at
this institution.
And then I'm still tied to
Northern by being the chief of
staff of Los Alamos National
Laboratory that helps with
the trades programs. And
so we're very thankful of the number
of employees who come in
to help us lead our national
security mission. And
so with that
uh president
chair,
if you could turn the mic
>> on,
when you're cruising around a lowrider,
we wanted you to
accept our gift. You're gonna
look like the coolest legislators
in New Mexico. We
got AAA Chicano
approved
uh baseball hat
here and then from the
bottom of our hearts uh as
you travel and you work hard during the
winter, we got
you a great uh winter
hat and then
uh our new
uh design,
we've got you a Northern
t-shirt as well. So it's a real honor
to have you and good luck with the rest of your
presentation. >> Thank you so much,
Mr President and thank you for
partnering with students and their dreams.
I appreciate that. And
so,
and with that, we're gonna move to our
next um
agenda item, which
is the Santa
Cruz de La Cananda Land
Grant. And I want to
welcome the
Bustos cousins to
come
up,
Mr Martinez. Coming
up
there needs to be a computer
swap. Is that ok?
Who's doing
tech?
And
then
for those of you on the webcast,
we're doing a swap
of computers.
Um And so
we're gonna be delayed for just a
second.
I beat you. Jamal
is named
after.
Yeah.
Oh, Roc,
we're ready for you.
>> Thank you very much.
Uh honorable chairman
of the committee and, and
committee members. My name is
Don Bustos
and I want to just acknowledge uh
uh representative
Miguel Garcia. I've known him
for years and he's
been more than just a
representative in the South
Valley. He's been a mentor to a
lot of us up here in the North and
we really wanna respect and honor
all you've done for us. Representative
Garcia. Thank you.
So, so my name is Don
Bustos.
Uh I'm
honored to be the chair
and the president for the Santa
Cruz de La Canda Land
Grant. We're, we're an interim
board. We've been working
to meet all
the requirements from the state
to become an official Santa
Cruz de La Canda Land Grant. And
we're here to present all
the work that we've done over the last
year and a half or two years
to meet those requirements.
I was here about two years
ago. And we said that
we're gonna start the process and
we want to just follow up and let
you know all we've done and
we're ready to go to the next
step. A little
bit of background about myself.
And then I'm going to introduce the board
members. First of all,
as I mentioned, my name is Don
Bustos. I own a small
farm called Santa Cruz
Farm and we
named it after the Santa Cruz
Church. And we named
it after the Santa Cruz de La Canda
land grant, which
is um more
than honor to be part
of those original families that
settled here in Santa
Cruz. I
farm 4.5
acres. My great great
grandma Alal Gracia
Valdez left
to Gena Valdez.
Then from there, I went on to
Trinidad Valdez. My
mom and that
land's always been in
the women's side of our family.
They've always outlived the men.
It's always been passed down to the
women. And I'm really
honored to that. My
daughter and my niece are willing
to start to take over the farm
themselves. My
nephew Netty is farming
and now he's been farming it about
5 to 7 years.
And then my grandson
Angelo, who joined
the Air Force, instead of going to college,
he thought he'd join the Air Force,
get his certificate in
Welding and then come back and
work at the labs.
So there's people that are really thinking
about how they want to go into the
future and how they want to preserve our
land and water
for future generations.
A little bit of just a background
about myself. And then I wanna
introduce, uh,
Christine Bustos, my rima
here and I'll let her talk about
herself a little bit and then I'll
introduce the board members
agenda.
Oh, yeah. So I wanna go briefly
over the agenda. When
is I, uh,
introduce the board members.
We'll talk a little bit about the
finances. We'll
go through our goals and strategies
a little bit. I'll turn
it over to Mr Martinez to
do the administrative piece
to uh confirm all we've
done. I'd like to turn
it over to Miguel Torres after
that to do the historical
piece on it. After
that, we'll have a testimonial
from Christine Bustos
and then we're gonna
do a uh empowerment
and growth kind of a, a
piece from Jose
Luis Ortiz bringing
in the youth kind of piece
itself. So I
wanna go ahead and turn over
it. Christine Bustos a little
bit of background about yourself,
please.
>> Good morning, Mr
Chairman, senators,
representatives and members of
the committee. Um
As Don said, my name is
Christine Bustos.
I am a lifelong,
of course resident
here of San
Pedro in Santa Cruz
where the Busto site comes
from. I
am currently the
economic development director
for RBA County
and for the prior
two years, I was a
commissioner. I actually
took Senator Jar
Ails place when he moved up
to the legislature.
So in my two years
as a commissioner, I
was very
honored and blessed
to meet a lot of people in the
different land grants in Northern
New Mexico.
So when the
Santa Cruz de la Canda
land grant decided that we
wanted to start getting up
and going,
they asked me to join
in. So
I'm doing my best to
learn and to be
a part of this great
tradition.
And other than
that, I guess
that's it. Um We are
working for Northern New Mexico
at Rio Riba. We're working with the
labs, we're working with
different entities
and we are working with the land
grants. So hopefully
we can all just
move
ahead.
>> Thank you, Christine. I wanna
next uh turn it over to
Brian Martinez, our
secretary,
>> uh Senator
Jamil Madam, chair members
of the committee
members of the community.
Thank you for having me. My name
is Brian Martinez.
I'm a Chimay Oso
uh uh raised
there as a farmer
and uh
stockman
um
long tradition
of uh agrarian
life there. I'm very
happy to be part of the land grant
movement and
um I'm very honored to
work with the people before
you. Um It's been
quite a learning
experience for us
and I think we've made
significant progress and
hopefully that you guys
will
see it that way
and move
forward our legislative
agenda. Thank
you.
Yes, sir.
>> Next on the agenda is gonna
be uh introducing Jose
Luis Ortiz in
Muez.
>> Uh good morning
uh
chair, Senator
Love you. Thank you for everything
you do.
Maestro
Tos Mis Respeto,
madam, vice
chair and all the
members, Maestro.
Thank you for your history of work
and primo
thank you for showing up
today.
Yeso,
Senator Pinto.
Thank you for your presence
as well. Uh Senator
Stefani, my name is
Jose Luis Ortiz Muniz.
I am a resident
of Northern New Mexico, Rio Riba
County. I also
help to coordinate the Sosa
program here in Northern New Mexico
College where we teach
traditional
indigenous and land-based
wisdoms life ways
as a goal to
create traditional
economics to help
create pathways that
support the success
of all of our residents
and uh and
members in this community.
Um I'm grateful
today to be able to share
uh the work that we've done
along with this incredible
team. I feel
for this region. This is a historical
moment uh um
as is leading up to
the legislative session. I
just want to say that when we look
at all the struggles
that we face in this beautiful
region in this valley, I
really feel that Lanre is the missing
piece that's gonna help
to strengthen
our community's
self-determination
uh capacity,
not just for
land grant heirs, but
our Pueblo brothers and
sisters who we're surrounded
by and
uh and all of our visitors
that come to this valley. So I
just want to thank you guys again and also
thank this incredible
team, including Miguel
um and all of our volunteers
who aren't here who have
helped to give
us the strength and capacity
to be able to arrive at this point. Thank
you.
>> Next, I wanna just mention
uh Bernadette Gallegos
was our treasurer and she had
to resign because of personal
issues just a couple of months
ago. So we have a, a vacant
position in our treasure.
Uh But we're gonna be addressing
it at the next board meeting
I want next,
we, we don't have any money yet
either. So
not a lot of responsibility,
but she did take it on. We,
we were able to function and,
and continue with our
obligations. I
want next uh
mention and introduce our
committee chairs. Our uh
his uh airship
and historical committee
is uh Miguel
Torres, Miguel. You wanna say a
few things? >> Sure
thing. Uh
chair senators,
representatives, everybody
present. My name
is Miguel Torres. Um
I am a product of uh Northern
New Mexico College. Um
I graduate or I graduated
high school in uh
1994. And I remember
in 1995 I can't remember
the individual's name but he was uh
working for the um one
of the offices here and we
met in the restroom.
We were, and he said, hey,
young kid, do you want a job at the
lab? And I said, sure he
says come to my office. And from
that point forward, I've been a lab employee for
the last 29 years. Um
So I, I work as a project manager
in Los Alamos. I
am the administrator
for the New Mexico
Genealogical Society's DNA
Project. Um I
have three
associate degrees here from Northern
Pre Forestry Range
Ecology, Southwest
Studies. I got
my uh bachelor's degree
here in Environmental science
and my master's from Columbia
University, Columbia South Southern
just uh most recently.
So anyways, I, I really
feel like this space. I give a lot
of gratitude to this space because
a lot of the things we talk about today
about, you know, helping the
valley, helping the
funnel the the people of
Northern New Mexico up to the labs and,
and giving to the community. I'm a
product of that
specifically. So
I, I'm part of this uh land
grant because not only am an
heir but with my
expertise in and
historical
knowledge, uh I bring
forth a lot to, to
this, um, this
land grant from a, an, a
historical understanding.
Uh, and you'll see
my topic today is about some of the
history and the people, but
that's where I come from and, and I
just appreciate being here today. Thank you
all. >> I, I
just want to mention other, uh,
committee members and,
and uh, community members that
participated really
regularly. Uh,
Brian Martinez is on the
airship committee and all the other
committees. But Eric
Martinez also participated
quite a bit on the discussions,
Al Duran and I don't
know if I was make it today. It
doesn't look like he's present,
but he attended a lot of our
meetings and, and
uh he made sure that
we're all uh doing
everything correctly at the right
times and making sure that we followed all
the rules and regulations.
And then Mr Valdez
participated quite a bit
and then uh Tim
Martinez also from
Chimayo, I just want to
say, say their names because they helped
us out quite a bit.
Uh Next thing I want to go
to is the mission
statement. The mission
of the Santa Cruz de la Canda
land grant is to and I'll
read this because it's a short
statement is to
provide living heirs, their
families and neighbors with an
organizational
mechanism for exercising
their communal economic and
traditional
sovereignty
support and enable a
means for expressing their
economic and ecological
self-determination
and political will
as promised to our ancestors
to the Treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo. And
third is to continue
the deeply rooted
indigenous land-based way
of our life embedded
in our land, a
seia spirituality, rituals
and community. It's a
pretty clear mission statement.
It's not very difficult to follow,
but we believe that's
what we honor and that's what we believe
in on a
move to the next kind of
a, a slide itself.
And that's our goals,
understanding that we are
an interim board of directors
and we have been doing all the
administrative requirements
and everything that's required us
from the State and the Land Grant
Council. But
understanding too that we're going
into the next phase of actually
doing detailed planning
and strategic planning.
One of our goals, the first goal is
to strengthen the community and preserve
our traditions of land-based
people.
The second goal would be to
honor our ancestors to
ensure our land and water
are viable and preserved for
future generations.
And the third goal is to
collaborate with community members,
stakeholders, partners,
agencies to develop a
strategic
plan.
And how do we go about doing
that? We start to create a
strategic plan
and that creates a mechanism
for economic viability
that preserves the commons for all
areas. And to
do that, what we're
starting to do is is starting
to create a
uh
land
bank.
So as older citizens,
members of the community,
and if they don't have Children or
Children, don't want to proceed
with it the Santa Cruz
de Can de La Canda would like
to create a land bank,
save those lands.
So, so future and
younger generations can use that
land for agriculture
and it doesn't get paved over by
asphalt and become
something else. We want
to use that land,
be able to create a land
bank and then be able to save
it for the future generations,
acquire assets, including
buildings and land through various
venues.
We do, we have ideas
of how we want to do it. We have
ideas what we want to do,
but we want to create a strategic
plan that really allows
us to follow through step
by step to accomplish
those. As I
mentioned earlier, develop and
implement the land bank for
farmland and water to be preserved
for future
generations.
Develop a pipeline for
young farmers to succeed in
agriculture, access
land and
water. And Joselu,
we'll talk about that a little
bit and we really wanna
shut out uh send out a big shout
out to the Northern New
Mexico College and President
Valder because
that's the pipeline that's
being developed, that
small farm that you see on
the other side of the campus,
that farm is being built
designed just
to create that pipeline
of young adults and
students that can
access that land bank we're
creating and bring
preserve our water for
future generations.
Because water is one of the most important
things that we have on the land
bank on the land of Santa
Cruz is our water
and our agricultural
land.
The next thing is to participate
in developing new
organizations.
And I mentioned that briefly
because we know as the
Santa Cruz de La Canda land
grant, we can't do everything
by ourselves. We
need to create partners, we
need to stay, creates
uh developed
shareholders and being
able to accomplish our mission
and to do that, there's a
couple of examples I want to
mention. One is the Santa Cruz
de La Can the Santa
Cruz Watershed
Restoration group.
We got together, Brian,
myself and other members
got together and we
helped repopulate
the Rio Santa Cruz,
Rio Meo, Rio
Canaro, Rio, Santa Cruz
uh Stream Association.
We started that about five years
ago. We have monthly board meetings
and that's all addressing
the adjudication
between the state,
the city, the pueblos
and the individual members
of the Equis, but
also members of the land
grant. So out of
that, we sat around the table
much like this and we decided what's
the best thing we can do
as a group of people
is we can, what
we say is
watershed restoration,
but it's really watershed
adaptation
to the climate change that's
occurring. So we're sitting
there we're talking about now. We
formed a group. It's a formal
organization
thanks to uh Connie Maxwell
from New Mexico State
University and the Weary
Program, she helped to
supply Steve Finch, the
Santa Cruz Irrigation
District, Kenny
Salazar, Dominic
Martinez, Ron
Gallegos. So helped us supply
to a bureau of reclamation
grant and they were
awarded that grant
funding to start that
restoration group. We've
been meeting regularly.
We're developing a
plan so that
it can be implemented into
the future. Using those
bureau of reclamation
funding. That's all from
the leadership of the Santa Cruz de La
Canda land grant. So
we don't plan to do all the work
ourselves, but we plan
to bring in other members of the
community and being able
to accomplish those goals
that benefit the whole
community, not just Santa
Cruz, but the whole valley of
Espanola and further
down the river. Also,
I'm also proud to and to,
to say that it's not
only us that are doing that, it's
a forest service, wilderness
people, both pueblos
in the area are participating.
Uh bl MS
there, there's a, it's a big
group of people that we're working on that
area. So I wanted to
mention that and then I wanted to
briefly just mention the
farm that's going on. And then
Jois will elaborate
that and then we want to
explore other growth
opportunities. But to
do all of that, these
are just goals and kind of dreams
and wishes. But to do all of that,
we're gonna wanna create that
strategic plan you saw
there. And then the last
thing that we want to bring up too also,
I want to bring up is this idea
of the finances
and the resource
development. We
wanna make sure that we acquire
all the state political
designations and leverage
that state support with other
funding and other
mechanisms that would allow us
to, to move forward our
dreams,
comply with all state and
local regulations
and then continue
the previous efforts
to Stewart the land
itself.
At this point. I'm gonna go ahead
and turn it over to, to,
to Brian. Brian
is a as,
as he mentioned, he's from
Ch Mayo.
But uh
you, as you'll, as you'll listen
to Brian and do all the work. He says
he has a lot of respect
in the Chimayo community.
His dad has been in the Chiman
community for years. They have
beautiful orchards in Chile
and then you're gonna see his
administrative uh commitment
to the land grant itself.
Brian, >> before
we have to Brian Mr
Bustos, if you can
let the committee know
members in the audience and those that
webcast, what are the
boundaries of the land rent
which Pueblo's neighbor,
you, the, the Espanola
Valley. If that's in the
presentation a little later,
after >> all that will be coming.
I'm gonna let Brian go through administration
because we felt that it's really important
to adhere to all the rules and
regulations and then
Miguel will take over the
historical. Thank
>> you.
I, um,
as Don mentioned, uh,
we've gone to great lengths
to make sure that
we adhere to
statutory requirements
and as such, I've
kind of put together a little
presentation that I'll read from
text if that's ok.
Um The
land grant Merce that Pueblo
de Santa Cruz de La Canala
spent a majority of
uh its organizational
time during the
2023
2024 fiscal year remaining
compliant with statutory
requirements in May.
We completed revisions
and approved our bylaws.
Moreover, we have been
working at becoming a recognized
political subdivision of the state of New
Mexico.
Last year, we drafted
a timeline that contains strategic
ben benchmarks
uh in achieving this
goal.
And uh we've made significant
progress uh
since our election of
officers in
2022
we submitted uh two
fiscal year annual
reports
and um
we want to thank the New Mexico
and Grant Council for providing
uh guidance documents which
have helped out uh quite
substantially and al
also the assistance
of Doctor Jacobo
Waka, the uh
historian uh who
is also in attendance today.
Thank you, Doctor Baca,
um
the Interim Lan Grant Merced
Board has been meeting regularly
on the second Wednesday of the
month in person
and over uh zoom a
video conferencing platform
and we have been meeting
consistently at the boys and girls
club in La Puebla, New
Mexico.
Um
We are building a group email
list and our recruitment
efforts and we will soon begin
reviewing airship applications.
The board has continued to
dedicate itself to public
outreach efforts on its web page
that serves to educate the public
about the land grant statutory
requirements and to notify
them of meetings and outreach
events,
meeting notices, agendas,
approved minutes can be
located on the site as well.
In addition, a
Facebook social media account
is being maintained to perform
similar functions.
Moreover, in January of
2024
the land gran was again afforded
an opportunity to discuss the
timetable of activities
working towards the 2025
legislative session with its
fellow counterparts and
stakeholders. The
Rio Crema, uh Chema
Rio and Merio Rio Frijoles
and Rio Santa Cruz de
uh Community Ditch
Association.
It's um it's a
regional secu association
operating within the grant who is
tasked with a secu stewardship
and irrigation water management
advocacy.
And we've also been working with the
Santa Cruz Irrigation District
as uh
don
explained
and they manage
reservoir operations.
Um The Santa Cruz Dam
uh this opportunity
uh combined with our
annual meetings once again,
uh allowed the board to
perform critical outreach
opportunities since a lot of the
parses are likely
heirs to the land
grant. And
so we were able to answer a lot of
questions and
uh demonstrate
our eagerness to become
a functioning land
grant. Uh
We held our
second annual meeting
in Chimayo in April
uh where we reviewed our
draft bylaws with the
community and
we allowed them to comment on
them.
Um
We invited uh
our local
uh elected officials
over and that
included uh senator
um commissioner Green
from Santa Fe County who represents
district one.
He offered his support
in our effort
and uh we've been
um uh
including our representatives
and all our email correspondences
uh to demonstrate our
administration and our
successes,
um
our achievements um much
of what we have achieved so far
um has been described
by uh uh Mr
Bustos in regards to our
community outreach initiatives,
our watershed management
plans,
um our
cooperation with our
stakeholder partners, as I
mentioned earlier.
Um
we've uh garnered
a lot of um
uh inner
agency
um
respect in that.
They, they've included us in a
lot of their uh
uh outreach and
uh their projects and they've worked
collaboratively with us
in, in the same.
And uh we're just very
fortunate that uh
that we're able to participate
in these activities since water
is our primary
natural resource. And
we want to ensure
that uh that it's clean
water, it's
available uh
uh for drinking and
for livestock and for
our agricultural
purposes.
And uh you know, long
term, we want to get
Chimayo the title back of
the Chimayo capital of the world.
And uh I think
that's a doable, foreseeable
goal. And
uh I, I think if we can
just manage our,
our water a little more
effectively
and uh and
manage our lands
and, and get the community
back into the mode
of, of, of, of
their ancestors of, of
growing food.
Uh I think that
uh we'll go a long way
in, in achieving
our goals that way.
Um
Lastly, I
uh I just want to say
that uh don's already
tackled the issues
regarding uh how we
plan on conserving our
water, working with New Mexico
State. We're also
working with the Conservancy District
with the Youth. Uh They're
going around um
last year they started
um surveying our
SECA and
they're surveying all the head
gates, uh any
obstructions that might be
in those AECs and they're doing
it through GPS. We
supported them in a grant
to pay, pay for this
activities. Um
We've also supported grants
from the Los Alamos
National Laboratory
and um
and for grants from
supporting grants from
Doctor Maxwell out of N MS
U. So, uh
we've been very active in the
community. Uh
um um
And uh we hope to
continue that effort.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm gonna go ahead and turn
it over to our historian
Miguel at this
point.
>> Thank you. I'm gonna read
a, a few quotes here.
So I'll try to make
this brief. There's a lot, you're gonna see a
lot of names and a lot of history
here, but I'm not going to expand on
every aspect that you
see, but I I think there are some quotes
here that are really worth
uh bringing forth
in their entirety. So La
Merced del Pueblo de Santa Cruz
de La Canda, the
official name of the land grant
Merced is land grant
Merced del Pueblo de
Santa Cruz de La Canda,
also known as the
Santa Cruz de la Canda land
grant, L Grant
Merced Grant or
Merced.
Historically, it was the
second official designated
villa in the Spanish
province of New Mexico,
initially called La
Villa Nueva de
Santa Cruz del Rey,
Nuestro Senor, Carlos
Segundo de Los
Mexicanos, Espanoles
later referred to
as Villa Nueva de
Santa Cruz and
now known as Santa
Cruz de la
Canda.
These are some quotes uh during
the De Vargas Reconquest
era um that are
really interesting to, to,
to hear about what
was being seen at that
time. So the first
observations of Don Diego de
Vargas, Zapata, Lujan
Ponce de Leon Marquez
de la Nava,
founder of the Villa de NVA, Santa
Cruz de Los Mexicanos, Espanoles
de Rey, Donar, Carlos
Segundo. I am
indicating for them
lands cleared and
plowed, known
for their great fertility
with the ditches, Aquis
and dams in working
order with irrigation
water insured
as well as new houses.
They need nothing more
to enter immediately to
live in them and prepare their
lands which I shall
designate for them.
The edict was April
1916
95
at said via
I found Don Jose
Manuel de
guilt naked
turned into a
living image of Lazarus
clubbed and badly
wounded whom they
said Indians of Namba
thinking that he was dead, had
thrown him in the
into the Estufa.
And who
feign that he was dead,
escaped from the said Pueblo
of Servia. Now, I I
just, I just bring forth that
quote only because we have
to remember these were very, very
difficult times. And for
us to be here today is a testament
of our
ancestors.
The to the question of
the uh original
boundaries. So or to the boundaries,
basically, we have 22 topics here.
We have original boundaries versus
the patented boundaries.
And so I'll first describe what
the original boundaries are,
are said to have
been. The historic
boundaries of the, the grant
are stretching west
to east from the junction
of the Santa Cruz River
at El Rio del Norte.
So Rio Grande to the
tributaries of the Santa Cruz river,
coming from the mountains in the
east and to the lands
of the Indians in San Cristobal,
near modern day Cordova, New
Mexico. The jur
jurisdiction also extends
from the sovereign boundaries of
Oe Pueblo
in the north along the west
bank of the Rio Grande
to the Mesa de San
Lif Pueblo in
the south east,
from the Rio de
Norte along
Oke Pueblo's South
boundary and from the
Rio Del Norte along
the boundary of the sovereign
Pueblos of San Io
Hacon
Pou and Nombe.
And so this image may not be
totally clear to you. You may uh
but you can see they
have listed San Juan and
the Southern Nombe and Pueblo.
So you can kind of get a
kind of a grasp on what
those boundaries were. I have a
AAA better image
in, in two slides.
And now we talk about the patented
uh boundaries and I'll, I'll read
some of these again. The Santa Cruz
de La Canalda grant was one of the
first land grants in Rio Riba.
Uh It was established by De
Vargas in 1695
with 66
settlers and their families.
Um We already went over the name uh
nearly all non
pueblo settlements in the
17 hundreds
grew from the Santa Cruz
grant and I'll expand that to
say that
essentially anybody
in Northern New Mexico
and this expands beyond Northern New Mexico.
But for sure, Northern New Mexico,
if you have colonial
roots, you are a descendant
of this land grant, there's no way around
it. The fam those are the first
families that ess essentially
expanded into what we now know as
no uh northern New Mexico,
Southern Colorado. And I
would venture to say uh
Rio Abajo as
well.
Um An
1899 US court
of private land claims decision
stripped the grants, common
lands. Therefore, the grant
was reduced from 43,000
acres to just
under 4600
acres. The United
States patented on July
7th of
1910.
Now this is this one kind of
overlays the two images. So we have
what I had showed in the first slide,
the original boundaries. And then
in that tan color is the
patented. So we can
see the enormous
uh difference,
right?
So I won't get into
too much detail when it comes to these original
settlers. But there's some really
uh
pinpointing points
in time that
are should be
concentrated on And one
is the original
settlement. But then we also
had a group of uh
pre revolt families that
returned. And some of those
are like the Apodaca Duran,
Salazar, Montoya
Trujillo, Torres
Martin Serranos for sure.
And those are just some of the names, not
all of the names. Um
And then I'll read this,
although there is no surviving
list of the names of the individuals
and families that constituted the
first settlers. There
are two important records that
confirm the presence of several
men on the day,
the founding, on the day
of the founding of the nue
Via. And
so some of those names
are some of the, some of these people
don't, we don't find those
names here anymore, but
through their descendancy, they're
embedded in us in other
ways. We have Antonio
Jorge, we have Nicolas
Ortiz. Um We
have the Fajardo
family, uh the
Buss family which became the
Bustos family. Those are some of the
originals.
Um We then migrate a
couple years later, we
have the 1697
list of residents. This is
primarily taken when um
De Vargas had an activity where he
was distributing
tools and,
and other necessities for these
settlers. And from that
list, we, we see the some of the
same families, the Ortiz's
Sandoval Bustos,
uh Atencio
Rodriguez's
Aragon Herreras.
Um The name, the list goes on
and on. This is a continuation.
We have Medina
Esquivel's
more Duran's
the Jaramillo's
uh that, that's
a very significant uh
time period.
We can move forward. Uh This
is the next big list of people.
So in 1707,
there was a census taken
of the Santa Cruz de la
Canda region.
And from that list of residents,
we, we now see the Madrids
Cerna uh
Griegos. Uh
Let's see here. We have
Trujillo's a
lot of the other families.
The Atencio are still here.
Lots of New Martinez's
that were prevot families
are now moving
back into the Santa Cruz,
primarily Chimayo
region.
Um The list goes
on and on and on. Like I said, I don't
really want to focus on the names if we have
specific questions that this
is a whole uh
presentation in itself,
right? So that's just to
highlight some of these.
But we can, we can
then say
that one of my previous statements
was that in the 17
hundreds, Northern
New Mexico was populated from these
people. So the expansion
to areas like
Cordova through
chas and all the
up high road to Taos
communities that make its way
to penasco. A lot of these
families eventually migrated
into Taos. Um
If we think about this,
as we know Cordova today was
Ya was Yano
Kema. And the name Quedo
transferred because the settlers of
Quemada went to found
uh found Yano Kema
in Taos. So there's that connection.
So we have that history of
these, a lot of these families
migrated to
ACU and then from a BCU, we have the
diaspora of El
Rito and every community in that
place. And then we expand it
further into Southern Colorado.
So really, I always
um I, I like to say
Santa Cruz is El
Corazon Del Norte.
So I'll turn it over to
um Christine.
Is she,
did she have to leave?
So, yeah, so essentially Christine
was going to give a testimony
on what it's been like to live
within the land grant. And uh
I don't know. Don, do you wanna, it's,
it's your family as well.
>> I'll, I'll read her
testimony. She, she's
a, you all know Christine.
She's got a lot of things going
on at the same time and
uh really busy and important
person at the county in different
areas. So I'll, I'll
read her testimony. Life
in the Santa Cruz land
grant. Uh
My branch of the Bustos
family descended from Juan
Jose Bustos, the
fourth great great
grandfather who was born
around 1722
in Santa Fe Novo, Mexico,
New Spain. Before
his death in 1808
was living in the Santa Cruz de
La Canda. His
wife Antonia Maria
Teresa Sanchez was
born in Santa Cruz de La
Canda in
1738
and lived her entire
life there.
One was ninth out of
13 siblings
as the descendants of the
early settlers of the Villa,
Nueva de Santa Cruz
increased in the 17
hundreds and 18 hundreds.
Families intermarried
with each other and
with the local Indians
founded new settlements,
actively transmitted
the cultural traditions of
previous generations.
Infusing their own innovations.
With each subs,
subs, sub
subsequent
generation to the present
day. At the
time, the
Spanish settlers
were almost all farmers and
stockmen. Although
family lure has
it that four of the Bustos
brothers settled in
the Santa Cruz area where
merchants and who traveled
and brought goods back to
sell them from other
areas.
The establishment of the Santa
Cruz de La Canda Aza
Vla in 1695
provided a second
focal point for expansion of
settlements east of the
Santa Cruz Valley.
Much of which involved
reclaiming pre
revolt lands and also
to the north up to the Rio
Grande Valley between Taos
and the Chama Valley towards a
BCU
with no encom
enara Mios
and a scarcity of Indian labor.
Even even for pay.
The resettlement process of
the 18th century, New
Mexico was ship
by small landholdings
that they call ranchos.
These were usually long
strips of irrigated farmland
on long lots with a
narrow frontage on the
ditch or the ACA
or a natural stream
with
several
of the such strips along
strung together along the waterway
to use up all the available
agricultural land.
Often the grant would include
grazing, hunting lands
extending into the hills
or up to the small val
valleys without
irrigation. Communal
grants also usually
included common
lands where Heos for
grazing or other communal
purposes such as
hunting and firewood
cutting. Over
the following two centuries,
prosperity came to the Santa
Cruz Valley with the
residents increasing and
continuing their livelihood by
farming and keeping
cattle enough for their
own use and some for
sale. The 20th
century was a major turning
point in the world for the
availability of the
engine, allowing
people to travel,
ship their produce and
animals by railroad and
farm their land more
productively.
The residents also had the
opportunity to attend school
and become educated.
Job, job
opportunities became readily
available. Especially
after project in Los Alamos
came about in the 19
forties. Currently,
the population of the Santa
Cruz area work in a variety
of occupations. Los
Alamos city county
state government,
they teach in schools and they
work in local retail
establishments.
But the traditions stay
the same. They hold
fast to their land.
Much of the which has been passed
down from generation to
generation. Many
plant a garden to grow their own
vegetables and harvest
the fruit from their trees.
Sundays, they gather at their
local church and visit their
relatives. We
value our traditions
and we continue to see them
carried on. And
that's a testimonial from
Christine Bustos. Thank
you. I wanna go
ahead and turn it,
turn it over next
to Jose Luis
Ortiz to give us
a short uh presentation
on the uh work that he's
doing with the Santa Cruz land
grant and creating that
pipeline for young adults
to be able to access
land and water. >> I
think you're done.
Thank you, Don Mr
Chair madam,
chair members
of the committee, I
just wanted to uh include
a little bit of history
Uh when
Mexico declared independence
from Spain and
became a slave free state.
Around that time period,
La El Canton
de la Nueva Vla de Santa Cruz de
La Canda was created
as a political party
in this region that was
inclusive of not
just people
from the Santa Cruz land ground, but
people from throughout northern New
Mexico including
indigenous Pueblos.
I note that because it's an early
example of how
land grants Aia
communities and our pueblos
worked together
to create security
and collaboration within the
region. Uh What came
from, that was an elected
governor of
the sovereign New Mexico.
Uh His name
was uh Joselito
Gonzalez.
Um You can
see him still at the legislature,
he was a
Genaro from the region
and also to note Santa
Cruz de La Canda isn't
just a Spanish land
grant. It's a land
grant that lived through
the Spanish Mexican
and American eras and still
exist today. We're actually an
amalgamation of Northern New
Mexico. We're
land based and
indigenous at the
core. And
we also speak
Spanish and, and pray
to uh Spanish God
and practice uh
Spanish uh traditional
wisdoms from overseas.
But mostly our existence
is rooted here. You
see it in our food, you
see it in our language and you see
how we relate our curn
and our connections to the land
uh with that. Um
You know, considering what
the future looks like
for our valley
is really uh taking
a, a look back. How do
you know where you, you're going if you
don't know where you come from, to
take everything that
is uh powerful
of our history and
apply that as a pathway
forward. Uh We,
you know, are constantly considering
and you know, and even, well before I
go on, I just wanna also
just acknowledge Johnny Chavez
who laid a lot of the
many first year
groundwork along with
others in order for us to arrive at
today. And also uh
the Landra Conejo and
Jacobo who have done great work to help
us get where we're
at. You know, we see a
future where our natural
resource and conservation
program um is
done by us
uh for the first time in a very
long time, our collective
leadership body and volunteers,
we have the
capacity, leadership
capacity to develop
these um opportunities
and potentials. You know,
we are constantly faced with
the housing and homelessness
crisis, not just
in Santa Cruz, but
throughout northern New Mexico.
And Santa Cruz is
located and
Miguels, the heart of the
Norte. It's located in a
very strategic point.
And we believe that through our
effort and through our future
development, we can
be
the, the pathway
to
uh addressing the issues
and the problems that Northern New Mexican
land grants face
as well as our Pueblo brothers and
sisters and, and all of our,
our neighbors and whatnot.
Uh We see ourselves
as a, a body
that can collaborate with
our aquis uh with
the irrigation district
to help better manage
our, our water resource
as well as get our
agricultural lands back into
production. Uh We're
facing um
catastrophic uh
land loss and also
land, non use, land,
fellow lands and nonwater
use. Uh We see that as
an incredible potential for the land
grant to step in its
role as government
to get these
lands back into production and
redevelop the traditional
economy of Northern New
Mexico. And like
my brother here said, uh revive
the Chile capital of the
world.
Um These partnerships
and collaborations, we really want
to investigate and,
and, and cultivate
uh you know, looking at our
local nonprofit organizations,
municipalities, governments,
colleges, and especially
the pueblos. Uh we
see ourselves as
relations to the pueblos
and we want to get back
to that El Canton de La
Nueva Villa Times
when we were working
intentionally collaboratively
together on all
issues and not
pose
as counter
parts to each other.
We, we want
to be
uh united with our, our
Pueblo's brothers and sisters.
Um As far as collaborating
with like the college right now,
we uh
mem heirs
of the land grant as well
as um members
of this leadership body have been
working really close with Northern New Mexico
College over the last
decade and most, especially
over the last five years
um and worked with
our chair, Senator
uh Jarami, as
well as Representative Herrera
and former Representative
Montoya to
um support the
college in getting access to
state resources
to create programs that
would um empower
land grant heirs,
their families,
and our Pueblo brothers
and sisters to
um apply traditional
land based wisdom as a way
of developing um
economy and keeping our people in
our community. It's true.
Los Alamos does take
all of our
intelligence and we're
left at home um with
not much and no opportunities.
We think the, the
tie between the
land, non land use and
nonwater use is a perfect
opportunity for us to close
that gap and create opportunities.
Farming is no longer
a poor person's
um uh
business.
It's very, there's great
potential in agriculture
uh these days. Um
And we see the Santa
Cruz la Canda as a
perfect canvas to
start to lay out that
connect the water,
the land, the tradition, the
culture, the chile, as
well as um you know,
putting to work some of what's
the outcome of the adjudication
of the watershed?
Um
Creating meaningful opportunities
for errors. I think that the
land grant can participate
and partner with uh Los
Alamos, with the state, with the
county to create
meaningful opportunities that
are culturally competent,
that are regionally relevant,
that also support
the, the greater state
and the region even into
um Southern Colorado. Because
as Santa Cruz is
what I call a Motherland
grant, um we are connected
throughout the entire
region. Uh We
see a great need for mapping.
Uh Right now
the to determine
what is
not, not only what is our
traditional ancestral
land base,
but also what is the patented
land base. What does it actually look like?
And also looking at what are
properties
ments Causeways that are non
claimed that we can
bring into our common
lands to create a common
land base.
Um And then
looking at those common land
restorations,
cemeteries, uh
traditional use easements.
Uh uh Our river,
um some of those are elements
that, that we think
that we have the capacity
to address and at least create
the pathway to address that in the
future. And finally, I
think uh one of the,
the most important things is
our identity. Um
History has
really beaten up
Northern New Mexico, especially
Santa Cruce, La Canda. The
version of history that's taught in the
schools is not an
accurate history to
whom we actually are as
land based people. And
we want to
uh uh address that
not only with school partners,
but also just in sharing
information in general, we
want to root back into our
land based
traditions and wisdoms,
our indigenous history,
uh who we are as
Genaro's captives.
Uh Mestizos brought
in here during times
that um it was
very difficult our
ancestors and, and Virgil
Trujillo, the president of
ACU or the
uh uh the governor of A BCU
often says we, we earned our land
through bloodshed. Uh
Santa Cruz de La
Canda is a very similar land
grant in that. Um
we
individuals were brought into
this region into Santa
Cruz to help
to protect our neighbors and
to create a system that could
protect them from the,
the struggles and the perils of those
times. Um
We're a very diverse land
grant. Um
We, we
have many different
diversities living within
our traditional boundaries
and we want to serve as a,
as a good neighbor to
them. And, and that's the future that
we see that we are working with
and in collaboration
really to restore a rooted
community and
also um to be able
to form processes,
pathways
mechanisms that
we can express not
only our political,
but our economic self,
self determination
and the dreams that
our young people and our elders
have for our value. So I'm
gonna leave it at that. And just again,
thank you, Mr Chair
madam, chair, all the
members, um all
of the leadership on this uh
current body, the
interim board of Santa
Cruz de La Canda, as
well as all of our volunteers
and our um large
huge body of heirs
throughout Northern New Mexico and
New Mexico at large. Thank you
so much, Gracias
gracias.
>> I just wanted to before we
open up for Q and A I just wanted
a as, as my
brother here was
speaking, it brought
up a memory of,
of this um
this date. It's my friend, Moises
Gonzalez, a collaborator
of mine. Uh He wrote a
chapter in a book on Genis Subtle
cultural landscape. Um
And in that he put this
data vis organization
mapping. Uh what
he says is the complexity of
the Kenia, of the
complexity of the Kenia cultural
landscape. And if we really think
about it, what you're saying here, and
what we've all been saying is we're
also interconnected in so many
ways, right? We can't separate land
water traditions,
uh our
identity. And if you
look at this, look at how complex this
is, right? This is, and,
and this is basically
cyclic. What we're talking about is
cyclic. We, right? We we're not
working in independent
modes like this happens now
and that happens later. Everything
is happening in cycles and we
keep going back and forth. But you
know, at some point, if anybody's ever interested,
I'll share this with you. But I thought,
I don't know if you can see it,
but it talks about the
land grants, the water,
you know, the social organization
like the Marmo, the
Hermanos penitents, the
Carmelita,
the artists,
the parent,
right? We can't separate any one of
these elements. So
I just wanted to end on that and, and
basically open up for Q and
A >> I
think that
thank you for allowing us
to tell our story and how we're here
today. And Senator, we do appreciate
all the work and we're open
for questions now if you like
>> very good and I'm gonna go
to Representative
Ortez. >> Thank you, Mr
Chair. Thank you so much for
that presentation. I really
love that map, that asset
map. It really
depicts the
connections,
land, water
cultural traditions,
history. It's, it's
really beautiful and it's, it's very
pretty to look at, it's very calming to
look at. And I think it's because it's
grounded and rooted in
community and in what
matters to this community and
what you're doing really
matters to this community. So
I think, I mean, I know that I,
I'm speaking on my own behalf,
but members of this
committee who want to see you
succeed in you
as you go forward with being
recognized, you know, whatever
you need to do whatever you
need from us. I think we're,
we're ready to ready to help
you. Um And don I,
you, the work that you've done to
engage young people
in cultural traditions,
like farming in particular
and what you're doing to feed this
community is something that I
just, I commend you for
and your, your work
is a model for other places,
definitely other places in New Mexico. But
people talk about you
and Espanol and the Valley
of Espanola and the, the food
that you're growing and how
that is so
much more than, than
just the food. So
I thank you. Um
I, you know, I encourage
you to have, you
know, have conversations with,
um you know, with YCC,
I know that you've had some youth
Conservation Corps members
already to keep doing
that, whatever we can do to support
you, the healthy soils, money,
like everything that there's so many
resources right now, I think at the
state level, you know,
for
what you're doing and we
need to get those
dollars flowing right back
to the communities that they serve. And
that's really, I just had a comment
and like I am offering
myself as, as a
research for you and whatever
you need to do going forward with your land
grant, just reach out.
Thank >> you very much for. Thank >> you.
Thank you Representative
Senators.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
So as I'm uh
looking at this
and I, I know you're moving
ahead for a political
recognition.
Um has
your land grant
sought any
um
assistance from the state
for emergency
situations like
flooding or
fire or
anything? Because
the reason I'm asking this
is I'm talking
with other land
grants
who
need that assistance
and we have
um
an office at the state that
would help, but
without your political
designation, I'm just wondering if
you've tried and been
denied or what's
what,
>> you know, uh We've
been really, really
fortunate and
knock on wood. We
haven't really needed that
kind of assistance
recently
about I'd
say about 15 years
ago, there was a, a
catastrophic fire
in the Rio Meri and Rio
Frijoles that
affected us quite a bit in our
irrigation agricultural land.
But we, we've been
really fortunate. We haven't had to
access those types of resources
yet, but we look
forward to understanding and
learning more about those
mechanisms when
those catastrophes do
happen. The Santa Cruz
de La Canda land grant will be
ready to act on it
immediately. Thank
you. >> Thank
you. So, Mr Chair, I think when
we um
uh
talk with the
consejo
later,
I see they're not on the
agenda, but
we need to find out
if they're getting the assistance
from the state that's
available to them or
not. So, thank
you though for your
responses.
>> Thank you so much,
Representative Miguel
Garcia.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you for that presentation. That
was, that was really
excellent
in terms of the way you did a division
of labor with
the different board members
and, and, and
folks and how
each kind of had
a specific message and
a
specific
role.
And the
thing is
um
that Mr Chair
is that um
you don't need
a political designation
from the legislature,
you already have
it.
The thing is Mr Chair
is that you need to
exert
your political
subdivision,
power,
authority.
And um
uh and what
that allows you
Mr Chair is
to access
capital L A
money
and there's no reason
why
you, the
Santa Cruz de La
Canda
should not go into
the 2025
session uh
without
a capital outlay
plan.
And I think you
guys
just need to identify
what those projects
are.
Mr Chair and
you've, you've stated
many things,
you stated that you want to
create a land
bank
uh for
the upcoming generations
to have
some place to build
a house
to,
you know, plant
the
Una Huerta, the
Chile Chimayo
Senno,
you know, which is kind of a, a
really
special
chile kind
of
not
only only
uh not even second
to uh
to the Chile from down
south. And
um but the
thing is that
in order to apply,
in order to qualify for
the capital outlay
funds,
you need to have your
bylaws in order
of which you have,
you need to have your audit
in order
of which I would
think you're getting
there.
And uh and then you need
other kind of uh
qualifying
documents
uh in terms of
financial statement,
etcetera, etcetera.
And uh
and Dr Baca can kind
of align those
things
to kind of uh
make this effort
happen
right now. You are political
subdivision
organizationally
is where is, is,
is where you're
attempting to get
to, you know,
in terms of uh being
all rounded,
you know, and you're, you're, you've
taken that and you've done
that the bylaws
is, is essential and
crucial, you
know, to kind of uh
exerting your
political
subdivision,
Power Authority, so to
speak.
And um
um
you know, and Mr Chair and you
guys address a
really
kind of essential
need in terms of the land
bank
because those common
lands that we saw in Yalow,
who are they, who
who, who owns them,
if not the
BLM,
see the BLM is actually
creating
the housing choking
uh issue in
Chimayo
because what's happening in
Chimayo is that
mom and dad are having
to cut into that
irrigable land
that have been in generations
in terms of producing chile,
producing the, the
fruits, the vegetables,
etcetera, to build a house
for son and daughter.
While we have the
mesa
that's under control by B and
M where we could easily
create housing projects
instead of them, our, our
younger gen our generations
to come having to kind of
encroach
on the rich irrigable lands
in the Chimayo Valley,
you know, and so that's,
you know, John John
Chavez was right on
in terms of targeting the
BLM in terms of
this, this
kind of uh
housing
chaos
that's forcing our younger generation
to move out,
you know, into a Burger Rio
Rancho kind of buy cheap
homes,
you know. And uh and with that
goes kind of the
continuation of the
cultura,
you know, and the connectedness
to the land when
our youth have to leave
their homeland,
their ancestral landholdings,
you know,
and
um
you know, it takes an effort to
Mr Chair to kind of coordinate
a capital
L A initiative,
you know, but I feel
confident that you
guys can probably line
up
some project,
define the
amount,
you know, uh by
whatever. Let
me give you an example,
you can use capital alley money to
purchase land.
A lot of the land grants are doing
that. They're expanding their
communal land base by
using capital all a
money.
Once you kind of establish
yourself through the
through the qualifying process
of
the
bylaws,
the audit,
the uh
other kind of financial
mechanisms that the state
requires. You can
apply
for the
land gran assistance fund
every year.
Since two years
ago, we
created a land grant assistance
fund where land
grants get anywhere from
80 to 100 and
$20,000 a
year to
do what they need to
operate and run their
grant.
And uh
you know, and you've got the experts that
can sit down with you and
show you what you need to do
to apply for that fund.
And it's almost the same criteria
that you use to
seek general
capital outlay
monies. You
know, the thing is you don't
need special status from
us to pursue
capital outlay to pursue
the land grant assistance
fund.
And um
uh
what a lot of land grants are
doing is
utilizing the capital
outlay,
utilizing the land grant
assistance fund to
expand the base.
You know, uh
the brand new land grant,
Los Veils Mr
Chair. Just this
last legislative
session,
their land ground was devastated
by the Calf Canyon. Hermits
speak fire
of the 4000 acres,
Espera Floresta
Espera Sierra,
the Love Velas line run
Pura Sierra.
Beautiful.
We toured that last
year. And
now what you see is just kind of
little toothpicks coming out of
the ground,
you know, uh,
and 85%
of their common
lands were torched.
That fire was so hot.
Mr Chair, it
bursted
boulders.
Can you imagine that,
you know, Pena
Lasco kind of exploding
by that the,
by the degree of hotness of
that fire.
So what those veilia
did, they
initiated a coordinated
effort to
pursue funding
for heavy equipment
so that they can open up those
roads to those burn
areas and
start receding,
bringing down that old
lumber, moving
some of that lumber down into the
valleys into so
so that the Herreros
can use that for firewood
like I, so that they
can use that heavy equipment to
open up roads
to improve the road that they
have.
And, and I mean, if you
go on those roads in Los Veils,
Mr Chair, like walking a tight
rope, you don't know if
the car's gonna go down a
Pola, you know, and they'll find you like
500 yards down the
down from the
road. But
they used that to, to
uh to purchase that.
They were shooting for
800,000,
750,000.
They got 1 million
$10,000.
They're gonna use that for an next,
for a, a grater
for a
um an
excavator.
Uh They're gonna use
it for a
bulldozer,
you know, and, and
they're on their way to really kind
of achieving their
goal of making
that their common
lands viable and
productive because
now they have heavy
equipment,
they're also working on trying
to take over an old
Slia that's been
abandoned for
their headquarters
and use the grounds of
that resita
to house their heavy
equipment
and they're going to do it through this
capital outlay,
you know, and
uh, and that's
what a lot of land grants have done.
Mr Chair, the
beque,
there was this old escuela or
a VCU that was just
running.
The Merce made a pitch to
the school board. School
board transferred
the
no, no money,
just a straight transfer.
And that's the case with
even Nara Maria kind of
old government
structures,
you know, and now that
you're really kind of organized
in terms of your board
and you're kind of really setting
forth on your vision,
what's out there in terms
of
Chimayo and
Canda? Are there these old buildings
that are just out there,
you know, just waiting to
be
developed by
kind of this bright leadership
that you guys have I think.
So
it's just a matter of identifying
it, making the Movida
with the entity
that has those structures
and ask that they
transfer no money
involved and a lot
of land grants have done that and are
doing it to this day,
you know. And
so
um
the, the, the
other thing that
Mr Chair that I think
Johnny Chavez really kind
of brought to the attention of
this committee back
then,
we just
the way that the BLM
excludes local communities
from any planning on
their federal lands
because, you know, you
guys know that they wanted to do a
recreational,
um,
kind of heaven
for outsiders
on that BLM
land. And
you guys back then
shut it down
with the help of this committee.
We protested that we
brought BLM to the table and
we told them you guys aren't gonna
destroy that land,
you know, for your kind of little
gimmicks to
bring in outsiders just to have
fun on our, on our
traditional landholdings
because we, the Santa
Cruz de La Canara have
not given up hope
and faith that we're gonna
win back those
common lands.
We still have Mr
Chair, you
know, uh
we have not
reluctantly
given up our
claim to
those BLM lands.
That's what Johnny Chaves was all
about,
you know. And, uh
and I think that's what your new
board has to look at as
well is the role that
BLM plays
in terms of the
dwindling
cultural vibrancy in
the Chimayo Valley
by them who's holding
on to this land
just for the sake of holding on
to it while you
guys have a vision and a
plan as to how
you can utilize those BLM
lands to,
to grow the community and
to empower the people,
you know, and um
but that's, that takes some
doing
and you
know, and some of the
struggles are going entail
ending up in court,
you know, and uh and that's one
of the shortcomings that we
have. But Mr
Chair,
thanks to the
collaboration between the land,
right community and this
committee, we've been
able to
create
a lawyer
pool
through this program that we
have at UN M law
school, the
Community
Governance
Attorney Program
to where we got
third year law students
buying into the program.
And upon graduation,
they have to go into a land
grant and provide
legal services
for up to
uh two years. Is it
Mark
>> Yes, Mr Chairman
Representative, what
they do is they get hired by legal
aid and then
you may be familiar with David
Benavides.
He offered the
legislature a couple of years ago
when they created the program,
the that he would
supervise and train
new attorneys. So they go to work
for legal aid
and they learn from the
guys that's been doing it for the
last 20 years.
>> So, so
Mr Chair,
you, you talked about
mapping,
we've given money to the land
grant council,
Uhura
Chuleta, Juan Sanchez
is the president of the
council to
do
um
serving
uh we put money
into the Dran
Council for Legal
Services
and whether they still have
some of that funding. I think
Jacoba could probably answer that.
But um
you know, these, it's,
it's important to really
survey your land
grant in
terms of what's what
especially,
you know, the panted
version
and uh and then start,
start from there.
Um But uh
you guys are on the right road
and what
can you say Mr Chair? I mean,
they, they're really
on the right road. I, I,
you know, and
uh uh and go
for it,
this coming session, go
for some capital outlay,
you know, and uh you
can brainstorm with
myself,
you know, who are your reps? Is
it Joseph Sanchez
is your state
rep
>> if you can turn your mic
on
>> Mr Busta Amil is our, our,
our
chair, our
leader there.
>> Yeah. You
know, and you know, we can work
together with collaborating,
you know, and uh
that's what we did with
those veils. I kind of helped
the Vaile get
grounded in
terms of developing a plan
doing an outreach in
terms of who to
contact. They were able to
get eight
senators and
reps to
contribute that
$1,010,000.
It took them
calling the, the rep,
calling the senators, not even
from their district outside their
district, but individuals
that kind of cared about the land
grant. Some of
those uh the the
committee members actually
went on the tour Los Villa two
years ago. So they saw the
devastation, you
know, and, and it's doable.
It's just that you guys have
to
put the manpower in
terms of
focusing
following through
and being forthright
and open
um minded with
people and,
and uh and then be
grateful for whatever
people are able to contribute
your way.
So
it doesn't behoove you to
say that you need political
status
because you have
it, you
know, and you need to
exert that political sta
status by
moving forward on
what is
a, a uh affordable
to land grants right now.
And the easy picking
is the capital
outlay and
the, and the
um the land gran
system fund,
you know, and
uh and not to say, you know,
what else is out there in terms of
federal, federal
monies as well
because that's, that's also
another advantage
of kind of exerting
your, your political
forthrightness in terms of
uh of a political
subdivisions.
>> Thank you.
And I'm gonna make my comments brief.
I was very impressed and I'm
standing because I'm having some
back issues. So I'm
gonna stand for a while. I'm
very impressed by that
presentation that you gave. That
was an amazing
presentation that
talked about our history and who we are
as people in the valley. And
so I had worked with
Miguel who checked to see how I
linked in to the
original families of
Nuevo Mexico of the
area. And that's where we
found out through the census
that my grandfather
was given to the Jaramillo
household as the native
American servant at the age of
three. And so I'm
40% native
because my, my mother
was adopted and we don't know
much about her
family history
and that's where we tied in
that. We, I'm really
not a jaramillo, but
I'm a Nuevo Mexicano
and a is just
like all of us who are a mix
of both cultures.
And so I do want to ask
that I come with the
students on the GPS,
guided tours of
Ase. I'd love to walk alongside
them and see the work that they're doing.
I want to thank you Don. And I
want to thank you Juan Luis for
everything that you do
for the next generation of
land RN heirs who are learning
from you. I want to thank
you Miguel for what you
do on showing who we are
as people and how we're
tied to the original
roots of Nuevo Mexico
and to you Mr Martinez for your
hard work. And now keeping me
informed on what's happening
in the land grant now,
I wish we could give you
capital outlay. But in
2023 the bill
change, we changed, we amended
a bill to list
every land
grant that was recognized
as a political subdivision.
Now, although we can't give you capital
outlay because we made that change
before 2023.
It was easy in a way that you
just had to show you did several
things including being a
board. And
so that changed
when we put those
subd those political
subdivisions into statute,
you were running into issues when it
came to the county or the
BLM to recognize
you as a political subdivision,
which is why we moved
to ensure you were listed.
But my commitment to you is I'd
gladly carry
the bill modification
and amendment to include
you on to that list. So
you can apply for capital
outlay and get the
other benefits of
those who are already listed.
And with that, I have no other
questions or comments.
Does anyone else?
Representative Garcia?
>> Thank you, Senator Mr
Chairman. I just want to,
the presentation was great.
You know, I just want to urge you people to
keep on working together
because you already lost
three quarters of almost
all your land, you know, just
to keep on working together
and, and you know, at the end of the day,
it'll all work out. You know, you
can't afford to lose any more than what
you've already lost.
Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Thank you. Any other questions
or comments? Now? It
looks like it's time for
lunch. If you have any
questions, you want to have some conversations
with him. The Santa Cruz de La Canera
land that will be here.
And what we're gonna do is we're gonna start
at 115
if you don't mind, which will give us 30
minutes for lunch
break.
Thank you.
