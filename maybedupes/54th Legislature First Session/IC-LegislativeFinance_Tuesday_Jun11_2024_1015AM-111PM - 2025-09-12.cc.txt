Yeah,
I,
>> Austin, Austin, let's
get them gathered so we can get going,
you know, Hill
for,
I guess let's see if
any,
any members have any
questions
after being
outside.
>> Yeah.
>> Representative small. Do you have anybody
on your list that's monitor?
>> Uh
>> send her she while we're
waiting.
>> So Mr
Chair,
because we were talking about pulling various
minerals and things
out.
I believe that lithium
is, is abundant in most
of the produced water,
especially from down here is
that
>> um it's,
it's all relative and, and
so when we say abundant uh
relative to
uh any number of other
formations, um
it is far
less uh abundant
here in the Permian Basin than
say in the Hainesville
shall uh in
East Texas or in
the Bakken um
Up in the Dakotas.
Um There
are challenges with
lithium extraction
here simply because
of, of
um uh maybe
a little bit more limited presence.
Uh There are some
and probably a fair
amount of, of good
thought that lithium
extraction throughout
the Permian Basin
um is more of a
conversation on economies of
scale, right? So
if you were able to bring in,
for instance, hundreds of
thousands of barrels through
an apparatus for extraction.
Um Maybe
that, that is a little bit more
of an economic conversation that
said there are a number of
organizations that
are endeavoring and
putting um both
time and treasure uh to
work in furthering that
conversation uh here in the
Permian. >> So Mr
Chair,
whether we do it here
or we use the technology
that's that we could develop
here and use
it in, in the Balkan
or wherever
else.
If you all haven't seen a Chinese
lithium mine, you ought to look that up
because it's pretty nasty.
And so everybody that wants to clean up
the planet uh should
take a look at what kind of nasty
stuff goes into the batteries
that we're building for our cars
and our phones.
Um and if
we can do it cleaner better,
faster
here,
it's cleaner, better,
faster
and it also helps build
another
piece of the economy. And I just
wanted to throw that out.
Thank you.
Thank you, >> Representative
>> Scott.
>> Uh thank you Mr
Chairman. This time,
it's
your, your gizmo
outside is
pulling the
biologics
and the crude
and the iron
out of that water
making it suitable
for
use
in oil field operations.
So that's
the definition
of economic
recycling at the
current time. Is that
accurate? >> Yes,
sir. Uh we would refer to
that as direct reuse.
So taking the produced
water treating it to
a standard that is
uh functional and
fit for purpose. Uh specifically
for reuse in the oil and gas
industry.
>> And Mr Chairman
Mr to go any
further than
that.
Now, we're talking
about
technologies to
desalinate
and
particularly in
Southeast New Mexico would
be accurate to say
that our produced water is
somewhere between
10 and 15%
rock.
>> So I would defer
some of this question
to our Chief Science
Officer Zach
Hildebrand. Um
what I would uh
note
um depending
on how we intend
the fit for purpose,
water to be used
would dictate whether or not
a desalination technology
is appropriate.
So, if there are any number of
industries that may
um prefer
to have a clean
brine or a heavy brine
in those instances,
you wouldn't necessarily need
to introduce a desalination
technology.
Um Zach, do you
mind?
>> Thank you for your question, sir.
Um So the
water in this part of the world
is uh anywhere
between 12 and
16% total
dissolved solids.
Um and those primary
constituents are gonna be sodium
chloride, magnesium and
calcium.
>> So,
uh Mr Chairman
and gentlemen,
it's a very obvious question
becomes
what happens to those
dissolved solids
as they are
extracted
from that produced water
stream? >> Yeah.
No, it's an excellent question,
right. So you're going
to remove the
water molecules from the
produced water to give you the,
the clean fresh water,
then you're gonna have these solids
that you're gonna have to deal with.
And so, as I mentioned out
there, I think that
necessity is the mother
of all innovation and
that, that those
solids could either be
mined for value, they could
be repurposed into
hydrochloric acid or caustic
agents. And
there's a tremendous push
on sodium
molten batteries.
And so, and I
think that technology is actually very,
very close within 23
years. And so the thought
of if we have mounds and
mounds of sodium chloride
that could serve as a feedstock to
produce renewable batteries
that can rival lithium-ion
battery technology.
That's an incredibly exciting
future that we'd like to be a part
of. >> And
Mr Chairman and gentlemen,
do you have an estimate
as to the volume of
salt that would
be
extracted from,
say
100,000 barrels
of water per day.
>> We're talking about considerable
volumes of salt
here and on
>> the order of 60
dump loads
of >> salt.
So
using your example, sir, if
we had 100,000
barrels of water that
we are running through our pretreat
and there are desalination
system, half of
that would come back as a salt
slurry where you're basically
at the point of saturation where
those metals and salts are
coming out of solution,
50,000 barrels a day,
which could be folded back
into your clean brine to
make heavy brine, which has application
in the oil field or
could go to mining for
the minerals or could go to
repurposing the
hydrochloric acid, the caustic
agents or could go towards
sodium ion batteries.
>> And so last question,
Mr Chairman, you would
view the
barriers to
this additional
step of recycling
at this time to be
primarily
economic.
And
if the answer to that question
is yes, what
is the cost
to produce a barrel of
fresh water from
this? >> I
would say again, I'm
just a humble
worker bee scientist here. I'm not an
economist, but my
understanding is that
the barriers as far
as beneficiary use,
repurposing this water to go outside
of the oil field are certainly not
technological. The
economics are becoming more favorable
to your question. You know, there
are various entities
which I've interacted, we've
interacted with that are doing this
for a dollar or
less a barrel,
particularly where you can
reutilize another waste
stream such as flare gas
to power thermal
distillation processes, you
kind of kill two birds with one stone
there. The economics get closer
to 70 cents a
barrel.
And so, and, and now
we've produced this freshwater that can
go, obviously within the industry,
can go to farmers and
we've got the salt slurry
that can go to various
applications.
>> Mr Chairman and gentlemen, a
dollar a barrel from
everything that I've
known in
previous
uh examinations
of the literature seems
very optimistic.
I think
that the Chevrons
and the Murs and
the Conocophillips of
the world at a dollar
a barrel would already
be engaging
in this activity. Can
you tell me why they might
not be?
>> I think there's a couple of things
there, to be quite honest,
there's not an abundance
of this uh
treated,
desalinated, produced water
available because we don't have the
regulatory framework to support
that. Right. And so if we have
the regulatory framework, then
you have the rules of the game which
would then allow the players to come in
and play that game. And
then you'd have a robust
landscape of opportunities
for that
>> water
at a dollar a barrel >> at >> a
dollar >> a barrel. And, and I can
to your point, sir, I mean, when I got
into this particular
side of the energy sector
in 2015,
uh eureka resources
was at the forefront of
not only technological
advancement but the favorable economics.
They were at 450 a barrel
and they weren't treating it to the
same standard that we are
now because they had the benefit
of diluting it into the Delaware
River. Um
here and I
just finished off a study
as I finished up in, in
academia where I looked
at 50 different treatment
companies and looked
at exhaustive
biochemical testing,
toxicological measurements.
And we did some financial
analysis and so
we know what works and what doesn't
work and what the the costs are. But
to your question,
um it does sound
optimistic at a dollar a barrel
relative to the historical
measurements, but uh
it's getting very, very competitive,
>> sir.
Thank you for the answers. Thank
you, Mr Chairman. That's all I have.
>> We're running short on time. Represent
pedigree, make sure we just get to the
questions and move
forward.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank
you so much for the presentation.
I would ask a very direct
question. Um
What statutory
elements exist in
within New Mexico
Law
that creates the biggest barrier
for you
>> uh Mr
Chair and, and thank
you representative. Um
The single biggest
challenge for
us is not
having
a clear
understanding of
what
um uh
standards
water should meet
for usage
outside of the oil and gas
industry. That's
your single biggest challenge
with discussions around
anything other than director
reuse.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank
you Mike for
that. Um
With the way that you answered
that question, we
have very specific
water quality
um outcomes
with respect to wastewater
treatment, the
same amount of chlorine, the same
amount of ions that,
that you guys see in
your produced water
uh
often exist in,
especially in rural
wastewater treatment
facilities. But
yet we're able to process
that and we're able to
redefine that
water uh
for public use in
many different processes.
Is there a way? Have you
looked at Mr Chairman
and uh uh
has infinity
looked at how we can couple
those, they're
both waste
streams.
Uh How we can couple one
set of statutory
requirements
and environmental requirements
with another?
That's my last question, Mr
Chair, >> Mr Chair
and thank you again, uh
representative uh for
the question. Um
The answer is
absolutely as a matter of fact,
uh this is exactly what
California did. Uh So
California started adopting
uh rules
um in exactly
that manner uh
through uh
2014
through 2020 if
memory serves,
um
there are again
just to, to, to note
and I understand that these other
jurisdictions are not New Mexico
and I'm not suggesting that they need
to be in New Mexico.
Um However, there
are templates that
exist most
notably in California.
Um Wyoming,
uh Texas is re
readily adopting
and innovating uh on the
regulatory and legislative
space. Um
Pennsylvania
um it and
almost an identical framework.
And then in truth, you can
look to the Clean Water
Act and the EPA
uh for standards
as well. Um
These are organizations
and um
regulation
that have dictated how oil and
gas produced water
is managed um
in offshore development.
Right. So, uh there
are absolutely
uh standards that could use
and serve as a template for this.
There are any
number of um,
jurisdictions that have
gone uh not a
dissimilar route to what you're
suggesting uh adapting
existing wastewater
uh regulatory
frameworks uh
appropriate
for this, this industry, the oil and
gas industry.
Yes,
sir.
>> I
>> Chatfield
repeatedly said we do not
have the regulatory
framework. You know, you're talking
to the people that would make the
regulatory uh
framework happen.
So I wanted to know what it,
what it was and I, I think you
kind of answered that. Uh
But I do have another
question. Uh Are
you primarily
under water law,
mining law
or the Department of
Environment where, which of these
things mostly regulate
you
that
>> um all, all
of the above uh
which uh
creates uh
in, in truth?
Sorry,
Mr Chair. Thank you for
the question. Um
The uh the
regulatory framework makes
it uh both
difficult to navigate
um
relatively
exhausting to
navigate. Um
I understand and I think
as organizations, we understand
why uh very
much, I think like the
industry itself as
we're, as we're iterating
and developing. I think
the legislative and regulatory
processes are,
are doing the same.
Um
I think for
one of our research projects,
we needed uh
either permitting or approval
through three
different or four
different departments.
Um And if
anything that we could
implore uh
specifically this body
to consider.
Um I'm
not personally
a big advocate
for
the state
providing any level
of money or subsidies
to the industry. I personally
think that if you guys
provide the level playing
field, uh the
um
you know, private, private
players will figure
out a way to innovate uh
and do what a, a
market does
that said. Um
I do think that
allocations of
proper finances
for personnel
uh would be critical
uh for giving
uh personnel the tools
and the resources uh
to uh
really effectuate
uh the direction that
the state and the legislature
would, would like to see them go.
I think that is a phenomenal
uh use of both time and treasure
for the state of New Mexico.
>> So Mr
Chairman,
I would
encourage you to look at
some of the states that have a regulatory
structure that works and
that works well that are
similar to New Mexico
and bring that to us,
bring that to the appropriate
committees uh so
that we can understand
how to help you. I think we all
want more water. I don't know
anybody that doesn't want more water
and uh we
have to know how to do, put
the sy system in
place that will help
us get that. So
there's bound to be someone somewhere
that's doing it and doing it
right. So if we could
see that it would be helpful.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you both, Representative
Dixon.
>> Yeah, thank
you, Mr Chair. Um I
just have a question about
the use of
A I uh in
your technology and,
and how that can also help
um with water
efficiency.
>> That is thank you, Mr
Chair and Representative
Dixon. Um Excellent
question certainly
from our standpoint. Uh
admittedly, we are a little
biased in that conversation.
Um from our
standpoint, look, if we want to have a big
conversation about how
to really introduce
uh and properly categorize
wastewater streams, you
have to know how to measure these
things. You have to know what
matters and what doesn't.
Um these are massive data
sets if we're doing this properly.
Thank goodness, we live in the
era in which we do uh
where uh very,
quite brilliant people
have figured out how to teach
uh machines uh to
make proper
sense of the just
reams upon reams of data that we
are able to collect. Uh
one of the things that infinity
has has done. Uh
We have created an
apparatus that allows us
to gather data in real
time from these produced water
streams. Uh That
data is then
um processed
if, if you will uh
through our uh
software um
speed wise water, uh
which does
uh include
primarily machine learning but
also elements of,
of, of A I in their
algorithms. The idea
being to, to very much
your point. Um
to a point
that was made earlier, we
can introduce uh
financial and
economic efficiencies
in any number of ways. It's
not just through uh
innovation around new
membrane technologies
or treatment technologies,
process, tech processes
and process technologies.
Absolutely can be introduced.
One of the things that we are most
excited about is
uh the, the
um the A
I learning
software that, that
we have uh co
developped uh with
a group out of Houston.
Um the
founders of which were the
asset managers for
all of Saudi Aramco's
assets. So,
uh we,
we try
always endeavor, always to
partner with uh the
smartest folks in the
room. Uh and hope that
that a little bit of that rubs off on
us. Uh But we
are actively working
to introduce that uh
to a, to a broader
sense. Um
The reason, the rationale,
any number of times we've
heard, uh
we need more data.
You're absolutely right. I
think there's a lot of data that
helps steer the conversations
that we need to have right now.
But the the opportunity to
gather more data and honestly
make really smart sense of
it. Um
That's at our fingertips
and the right again, kind of
the right regulations that
encourage us to
collect and use that data
intelligently.
Um I honestly think that
that's what we should all be endeavoring
towards.
>> Thank
you.
>> Thank you very much, Mr Chair,
uh and Mr Chair, I was
skeptical but I want to
compliment you, I think going
outside and seeing uh
the facility
was a really excellent use
of time. So thank you for that,
Mr Chair, panelists,
a few quick things
first, uh a few
things that we sort of worked through
outside. I just want to sort of get
on the record here. Uh
Mr Chair, Doctor Hildebrand,
you, so you said
roughly uh for
reuse in oil
and gas operations,
there's about a
90% plus
efficiency. So
the question was
asked, a gallon goes in
up 90 plus percent
of that can be reused in the
industry. Yes, sir.
Ok, thank. And Mr
Chair. You also uh I
recall once
we start to think about
desalinization
and use in
other areas
that that goes
to about a 50%
efficiency right now.
Yes, sir. Ok. And
Mr Chair,
Dr I also heard, which I
thought really struck me
is that there's been
um
vast and
rapid
decreases in cost
to get to those
levels over the last several
years in
the industry that,
that sort of covers the
nation in use.
I I, what I heard I thought
was, you know, say four
or five years ago,
four plus dollars
uh per
unit. Uh
Now we're down
to a dollar
or so. Yes, sir.
And Mr Chair, last thing on
that, it was
also uh what you
shared is that those,
you see those costs
continuing to drop
as more and more
innovation and sort
of focus goes into this
area without a doubt. Yes,
sir. Thank
you very much, Mr
Chair, um
panelists, the
um uh
you know, with
the frui, I think there's a
bit of uh
unclarity. The law
is very clear.
Anything that's in the
oil field is
governed solely by
energy, minerals and natural
resources through the oil
conservation division.
Anything that
potentially could happen
outside of the oil field
in the future falls
solely under the jurisdiction
of the New Mexico Environment
Department. Uh and
specifically the Water Quality
Control Commission, is that
your guys'
understanding?
Yes, it is. Ok.
So and then
you know, as there, maybe you
want to seek a permit to do
something outside of the oil
field where a land
status includes some
federal land and some
state land, maybe
some municipal land,
that's where other
components where you have to
get permits from other
entities. So
that's more of that's not on
the treatment of the
water that's on
sort of maybe the the
ownership of, of the land
or other assets. >> Yes.
Yes, sir. So as we work through
these, these pilot
programs or research
projects,
it's holistically
any number of, of
organizations that we need or
authorities that we need to seek
approvals >> from
it. But
and Mr Chair, but just so
when we're talking
specifically about
the water and its
uses reuses
uh that is
solely energy
minerals, oil conservation
division inside the
oil field,
solely New Mexico
Environment department outside
of the oil field. >> That's
our understanding. Yes, that, >> that is
absolutely my understanding.
I think that was our understanding. I was proud
to pass the bill back in
2019,
unanimously through the
house said it didn't
quite get to unanimous, but you guys
got close.
Um
And that was one of the really
important parts is we
really wanted to strengthen
and clarify
the jurisdiction uh
for,
for uh the
water. Uh, you also
spoke about liability,
liability transfers, sort
of upon possession and ownership.
So whoever first
produces it, it's their
water until
it goes to you all as
a water company, you all
assume that liability
when you take over ownership of the
water. Is that right? >> Yes.
Yes, it is Mr
Chair and, and representative.
If, if I could just even add an
additional color
there,
I'm a recovering attorney on top
of everything else.
And, and what I would tell
you is
that the, the
cleanliness of that custody
exchange,
that's the brilliance of
the Produced Water Act that
in and of itself is what
differentiated
House Bill 546
from any number of,
of jurisdictions approaching
similar legislation.
>> Got Thank you, Mr Chair.
Um Thank you.
Um I know that we're
gonna go deeper into
this. There were some other points
uh I do want to get on the
record here. There was a question
about pfos that was asked,
Doctor Hildebrand, you
tested or you shared
rather in that setting
that there
were effective
methods to
uh lower
the pfos
that came up and produce
water. And then, in fact, you found
less
pfos in uh that
produced water that you were
treating than in some
other.
Uh >> Yes,
sir. We have found
that raw produce
water has
less concentrated
and less variety of
pfos species than
municipal drinking water that
has been treated.
And that we've also found
that the treatment of those pfos
compounds in produce
water can be
effectively performed
with various oxidation
and filtration
technologies.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you.
I'll wrap up
here.
The uh
we're sort of as
we look on the economic side
of it. Is it fair
to say that
the incentive side
increasing the opportunities
for reuse the reward
for that in various
ways, whether through
uh sort of
certainty
and, or potential
incentive, that that's
one side of
continuing to
uh make it
more cost efficient
instead of to send all
of this down very deep water
wells and cause
earthquakes uh
to do other things with
it. One is the
incentive side, right,
>> Mr Chair, and the rewards
to, to a degree. Yes.
Um This opportunity
for a, an organization
to enter in uh
effectively product
variation uh to
the market.
Um
like any other
uh honestly
market system, certainly
where we're talking about a commodity
exchange.
Um Yes,
that's absolutely correct. Uh
Greater, greater market
participation is
always going to be critical. Uh
But also I would, I would
underscore um
economic incentives to
help an industry
um take
root in, in
Virgen. Makes,
makes a lot of sense. And then you
revisit that typically
when um
the uh the industry
is, is self
sufficient and is growing,
right? Um I
think from uh
certainly this standpoint,
the first step is
uh helping an
organization understand
the opportunity set through
a level of stability. There is
an opportunity for us
to start innovating
uh in these spaces that
allows us to have conversations
with capital providers.
So your typical financial
institutions, everything
from um
you know, your top five
lenders and banks down
to your grants,
your venture capital,
private equity, everything in
between
every one of your capital
providers is going to want to have a
conversation about
market as surety,
how likely and, and that's
a fundamental aspect
that, that the
state can provide. >> Understood. Thank
you very much. And Mr Chair,
the other side of that is
to make disposal more
costly either
through sort of
incremental fees
on disposal
and or things that are
being at least discussed like
in Texas, which is what in
some areas to
essentially shut off the
ability to do more
disposal because
of the seismicity. So
whether it's done
incrementally
or uh in a
broad swath likely
in a reaction to
seismicity,
making it more costly,
perhaps far
less possible to
dispose is
the other half of that
making this continuing to
make it the most economical
to treat and reuse
fit for purpose. >> Mr
Chair representative,
I am always going to err on the
side of carrots rather than
sticks.
Um I
think uh a
lot more can be mutually
gained in those types of
conversations that
said, I don't necessarily know that
functionally you're incorrect.
Um
New Mexico did
and has historically made it a
little bit more difficult for
disposal to happen in the
state. And a lot of
operators responded in the
state by sending
copious amounts of their
produced water into Texas.
Texas um
allowed for considerable
amounts of disposal up and
down uh the state
line, which is one in
large part, why
Texas is having
difficulties that they are experiencing
currently with seismicity.
Um So I
would, the only thing I would
say there's functionally and
theoretically perhaps you,
you spot on,
but I would pay attention
to unintended consequences
of, of, of
sticks. >> Thank
you, Mr Chair. Well said,
and I appreciate the extra
context there
then.
So returning
now to our Produce Water
Act, we, you know,
there are
active
sort of ongoing
rulemaking and other things.
Uh
having more
science
and more
uh well
prepared employees
particularly in these
agencies. Would you
agree that that's critical
as we sort of create the
rules of the road moving
forward, >> Mr Chair and
representative? Absolutely.
I think it's always
a good idea to
err on the side of more
information. >> Abs to
totally agree.
I know there's produced water
Consortiums in Colorado
uh in Texas. Clearly,
we very much have
11 of the best,
I think the best here in New
Mexico. Um
But we did this
really helps show
for all of us as we
consider the budget
when and we've made very deep
investments in our regulatory
agencies voting
on that budget and
investing in more
regulators
is
absolutely
essential to moving
this conversation and discussion
forward in a well balanced
and in the
safest possible way.
So, and we've, you know,
we've, we don't have time to go
into it now, but we've made very
deep investments in that. I think
we're gonna continue to do
it. Um
I think that wraps up the questions
for now, Mr Chair. Thank you
very much. Thanks to the members
for a lot of great questions, both
outside and over text
and glad we get the chance to get
them out there. Thank you.
>> And you just kind of wrap up earlier
in your presentation. You mentioned A
I, how, how does A I
gonna affect your water systems?
>> Great that
what it does is it helps teach
us how to improve the
efficiencies on our water
systems. Uh
Honestly, it would help
anybody improve
uh the efficiencies of their water
systems. Uh
I think it's important for us to
note uh Mr Chair
uh that
um
there is a co-operative
and a cooperation that has to
happen uh
Water
uh probably shouldn't
be viewed as
Infinity's Water or Exxon's
Water or municipal water.
Uh There's a greater
ecosystem and a greater conversation
that could be had. Uh We
would believe strongly that the
right type of
applications of, of
A I and machine learning
um could help
us all just learn
greater levels of efficiencies for
across all systems, but
also very specifically to your
question. Uh It
helps us dial in
um what kind of
treatment agents would be
necessary? Having a
level of predictive quality
to, that allows us to,
to draw costs from
everything from
preorder uh
chemical
uh treatments
to um
additional filtrations,
help us schedule our
um you know, our
filtration and maintenance
conversations.
Um the
the the benefits of,
of information and
data are
honestly, they're limitless Mr
chair.
>> And yeah, I mean,
the biggest worry is, is water
becomes a commodity, right? Once
water becomes a commodity in, in
any country, especially
in third world countries, right?
Then it becomes detrimental to what's
happening. >> I
I
I do apologize for,
for, for jumping ahead there, Mr
Chair. I don't think
you're wrong. What
I would emphasize is
that we are not having a
conversation. We do
not want to have a conversation
around freshwater
resources, not in this
regard. I think having
a conversation around
um
changing a waste
source, very specifically
what is a waste source?
Well, it's the affluent that
is coming from the oil and
gas industry or honestly,
food and beverage foo
um uh
manufacturing any
number of industries,
municipalities,
this waste
source is not necessarily
being reclaimed back
into the into our water
systems. And that is
what's putting a tremendous
amount of downward pressure
on our existing
freshwater resources
if we can alleviate that
pressure. That and
I, I think we've done
a tremendous amount of good, but I I
do understand uh
it could potentially lead to
a slippery slope. Um
Let's have an intelligent
conversation around
what can be and maybe
should be incentivized through
private industry through maybe
commoditization conversation
versus what needs
to be preserved for
the um
well, health,
welfare and, and safety
of people, agriculture
and wildlife.
>> You know, there's water is a limited
resource. So, I think when we keep
moving forward, I mean, you're gonna start
talking about market demands.
I mean, they're paying 10 cents in
the market right now. They are at a
dollar. Where is that can
equalize? Sure.
You can just,
just, you can
raise the cost of,
of getting
rid of it? Right. But
does that really push the
market to, to do?
Where's that breaking point? I mean, that's,
that's, there's a big questions, I think
we have a regulatory
agency seems the environment
department doesn't ever seem to want to show
up when we, we really want
to make committee meetings and really need
them to talk about this. This was
their idea last year. This is the
governor's, uh,
one of her key points
she wanted at the end of sessions was
when clean up
water and what are we going to do with it? But
the agencies aren't here.
It becomes
harder for us. Maybe we're gonna
have another hearing and we know we're gonna
have another hearing in September.
Probably gonna be EMD and, and
bring a bunch of the environment
department in and try to figure
this out as we head to the session. Who's
gonna do what and how we're gonna do
that or if we
move it out from under them, if they're not going to
show up so we can have some
answers. Uh, the
produced water rules are still not
out correct
since 2019. I
think they were working on them and
I think they're stalled till
July if I remember
correctly in the paper.
So those are key things that have to
happen for us to move forward and know
what we're doing as we move forward.
So thank
you for your time. Thank you for showing
us your equipment and your truck.
Appreciate it, sir. >> Uh
Thank you Mr Chair,
uh and the committee.
Uh you guys have been very generous
with your time. Uh Thank you very
much uh to your point,
Mr Chair. If we can be of
service going forward with any
of the questions that you or,
or your colleagues have,
please do consider us a
resource. >> Ok. Thank
you, Mr
Austin.
Do you need another mic over there at
Austin? Cause you got three or four
people on the board
or it
guys.
So it's been
that
you gonna pass a hot potato
every
time.
Uh Just take
Senator Compost is there and if we're
not, we'll signal somebody.
So
you keep all your people
waiting in the
>> hall.
>> Oh,
go ahead and start us off then while you're waiting
for them to come
in.
>> Uh Good morning, Mr Chair
members of the committee. Uh
joining me today on this
panel regarding oil and gas
setbacks. It's going to be Doctor
Tammy mcmullin from the
center for toxicology
and
researching.
>> Ok.
Yes, there's gonna be
an hearing brief
number
reminder,
>> tee
>> tee
>> tab B or
binders.
If it's not on, they're gonna text
us that they're not hearing you on the web
but it's on.
Ok,
>> chairman of the committee. I think
some key contexts
for the L C's brief is
that this brief is
a summary, is a starting
point, not an ending
or a conclusion on the
discussion.
>> Austin pull that mic
closer.
>> I think it's
not.
You have another
one.
>> Let's get you one because my phone
is
>> Mr Chairman. I think there's an issue
now.
>> I I'm getting like
blowing up my phone text. I
can't hear you.
>> So
you want
>> mine,
>> Paul, >> I muted
everybody.
>> Um
Try it now.
>> I think it's
>> good.
>> How do I do that? I'll do it
again.
>> I'll over Mr Chair.
New Mexico is the
United States second largest
producer of oil producing
15.1% of the country's
oil as of February
2024 averaging
roughly 1.98 million
barrels of oil production a
day. New Mexico
currently has 73,000
active oil wells
and revenues from the oil and gas
industry account for an estimated
38% of the
state's general fund in
fy 24. While
generating revenue for the state
oil and gas production has also
resulted in methane,
particulate matter,
nitrogen oxide and other
chemical compounds to
be released into the air.
These chemicals from fossil fuel
production have been linked to
increased risk of asthma
lung disease and
mortality with the risk
of these diseases. Generally
found to be increasing with
closer proximity to
production centers that produce air
pollutants. Setbacks.
Distances set by law between
production facilities and
protected areas are meant
to alleviate the risks of
diseases for people who live
in those areas. While
there is no current universal
consensus on recommending a
specific setback
distance to protect citizens
proximity has been associated
with health risks.
New Mexico does not have
state laws creating
setbacks. And according to
the associated press, over
144,000 New
Mexicans are estimated
to be living in or attending
school within a half mile of
oil and gas production
going down. In the brief. You'll
see setbacks in New
Mexico while the
state has an emergency declaration
from the state land office
regarding setbacks.
The state has no statutory
laws regarding
setbacks. However,
some counties and municipalities
have imposed their own.
Specifically, Edie County
has oil and gas ordinances
requiring 300 ft
of distance between
wells and residences.
City of Carlsbad also
has setbacks in place.
Drilling of wells must
first be approved by the city
council and the company must
show that it will not
contaminate the city's water supply.
If you'll turn to the second page
of your brief, there is more
detail into the other
counties and municipalities
regarding setbacks
for other states,
setbacks, Colorado
increased their initial setback
distance 500 ft
to 2000 ft
in 2020 which is currently
the largest setback in
practice nationwide.
California has a
3200 ft
setback but due to legal
conflicts, it is currently not
in action. It is on the
ballot in Fy
24
Wyoming has instituted a
setback of 500 ft
from well heads to the closest
occupied structure.
North Dakota allows
development without setbacks
and instead requires property owners
within 1000 ft of a
proposed well
to petition the state's Director of
Oil to stop that well
and then create a
setback.
Although none have been enacted.
Other states like Oklahoma
and Montana have also considered
setbacks for oil and gas production,
citing similar concerns
about health impacts. If
you look on the left hand column
of the second page, you'll see New
Mexico's recent
legislation regarding setbacks
and a brief history.
The other discussions in this brief
are air quality and
drilling implications and there are
also maps in the back that
map out different
setbacks and more data
on that could be asked by our
economists. I will now
turn it over to Doctor Shae
for his presentation. Thank
you.
>> Yes, yes, that's correct.
One.
Uh Good morning. Uh
Thank you for inviting
me uh
chair Munoz.
Uh This is the
first time I am presenting in
this way. So uh bear
with me. Um
the presentation in
front of you was uh
designed to be
uh on a projector.
So uh that didn't
materialize. Um
So please excuse
that there may be a few extra
slides in there that are a little
bit um
fluff as it may
appear.
Uh I'm presenting here
uh as part of
the consortium of
scientists that you see on
the second page uh of your
hand out. Uh This
is research that is
currently happening in
Eddie County
about 10 miles south
here in uh Loving New
Mexico. Uh
the scientists
uh on the pictures here
are from four different
uh institutions
uh and represent
a combined
over 100
years of experience in air
quality
research.
Uh I myself, I'm an
atmospheric chemist. Uh
I'm a faculty member in the
Texas A and M Department of
Atmospheric Scientists
uh Sciences.
And I have 30 years of experience
in air quality uh
atmospheric chemistry
research.
The results
that I'm showing are
from a project that's
funded by the Health Effects uh
Institute Energy
Division and has
not yet undergone
uh the rigorous peer
review that he
I uh puts on
these uh
projects. Uh
Conoco Phillips is mentioned
here because uh Conoco
Phillips provides uh
in kind support
via letting us do
these measurements on their
property. Uh In
loving.
Uh The study motivation is
clear. Uh That's the next
slide. Um
Since 2015,
there has been a very strong increase
in oil and gas production
uh that
also is associated
with a very strong increase
in uh gas
flaring uh which you see
on the right hand side
of uh
um three
uh in the form of
a density map. So
the brighter the colors
here, the more flares
there are active uh
per area
in this region. And you can
see that this part
of New Mexico here
uh has one of the
densest
um uh
agglomeration of
flares um
in the nation. In fact, uh
this is
relatively easily
visible from space.
Um And it is very well
documented through
various satellites
that look for the heat signatures
of
flares
moving on to the next slide.
Uh You see a quick overview
of uh where we are
situated. Loving
is more or less
in the center uh of
the oil field. Uh Most
oil and gas production
um ends
uh close
or just beyond the borders of
Carlsbad.
Um And there's of course
a very large amount of oil
and gas production south uh
of Loving going
into Texas.
On the right hand side, the picture
shows our measurement
trailer. Um
and there's also a link to
a web page where you can see
near real time results
from the air quality measurements
that are happening at the
site. Uh
The link works on
your cell phone. So you're
welcome to uh bring it
up, ask me some questions about
it. Uh If you see something
interesting, um
I will mention one thing
um Here in a little
bit.
Next slide gives a list
of the air pollutants that
we are currently
still measuring at the
site.
And it provides
also a quick
overview of one
of the lead pollutants
that I'd like to
address here
in a moment, which is
ozone,
ozone forms in the
atmosphere. Ozone is
not an emission
from uh anything
at the ground. We call
this secondary pollutant.
It is formed
in situ in the atmosphere from
atmospheric chemistry.
Uh There are essentially
three ingredients uh to
this chemistry. One is
a fuel. Uh This
is typically named a voc
or volatile organic
compound. Um
I will switch that
terminology here in a
moment to the
dominant amounts
uh the dominant compounds
within that larger group
of voc. So this is a catch
all phrase VOC
and you heard it now and you
can forget it for the rest of my
talk.
Um Nitrogen
oxides are the second ingredient
for the formation of
ozone. It acts as a
catalyst in the
ozone formation process.
Uh The third ingredient is
sunlight. This is
why we do
not have typically an ozone
problem at night.
Um Sunlight
drives the chemistry
in the atmosphere. So
as the
sun comes up in the morning,
chemistry starts to
intensify is
about uh
at this intensity maximum
between noon and three o'clock
in the afternoon. Uh
and then starts to
wane
ozone forms
as a result of
that chemistry and
accumulates in the atmosphere
until the production
process of ozone
comes into equilibrium
with the destruction process
of ozone. And as
soon as the sun sets ozone
typically is
diminished and may
completely
disappear
overnight depending
on what other pollutants
are in the
atmosphere.
The list of pollutants that you see
listed on this slide
have some
in italics, some
not the ones in
italics are uniquely
measured by us.
The ones not in italics are
also measured by Inmet
at the
Cold Spot air quality
monitor
which is on
the west side,
slightly southwest side
of call
sport.
Since this um meeting
is about um potential
legislature on setbacks,
I'm going to uh
briefly talk about
three different aspects
of our measurements that may be
helpful for you to
decide on the topic of
setbacks, uh
gonna talk briefly
about emissions and
exposure to uh
air pollutant emissions.
Um I'm gonna talk
about uh ozone
formation uh briefly
again and what the current status
is um, of
ozone uh in
the area. And then I'm gonna
have two quick slides
on health effects uh that
ire together before I knew that my
colleague, Doctor mcmiller uh
would be
um at this
meeting.
So on slide
seven,
there is a
picture that
um
gives you a brief idea
uh of a
kind of a worst case
scenario of uh
pollutant emissions. What you're
looking at is a black and white
here that
is um a
snapshot of a
video that was taken 10 years
ago. And that is very common
these days. It's from
so-called forward
looking infrared,
um
uh forward
looking infrared camera
or quick
briefly called a
uh camera. Um
It is
able to detect
very sensitively
uh hydrocarbons in the air, particularly
methane as the dominant
hydrocarbon in air.
And the gray that you see
in the uh plumes on
the left are essentially
hydrocarbon plumes
which are emitted from
this particular midstream uh
facility uh in
the ele foot uh
such
clear uh
footage is
available uh
for large
areas of oil and gas
production all over the United
States. You can find it on youtube
and other uh channels.
Uh The camera is very expensive
but some
um
state agencies such as
TCQ in Texas have
these cameras and they use them
to determine where
uh leaks are
present at
oil and gas facilities.
Even the industry is using
some of these uh
cameras to determine
uh leaks of various
sizes. Um
You have to use something
like this if you
want to do leak detection.
Um because these
hydros are not visible,
right? You can only see them
infrared and the particular
filter on this camera makes
that
possible.
On the next slide, you
see an example of an
analysis that
we did for the measurements
of nitrogen
oxides
at the loving
site.
Uh nitrogen oxides
are the products of
combustion, any combustion,
the hotter the combustion, the more
nitrogen oxides uh you
make. Uh
So all
the vehicles on our roads are
sources of nitrogen
oxides uh in the
oil industry. Uh As
a source of nitrogen oxides, you have
compressor engines, usually
diesel powered compressor
engines. The other large
source is gas
flares.
There's no compressor engine
at the path site
next to us.
Uh In Loving, I
should mention that the path site is
not owned by
Conocophillips.
Um
What you see the
extension of that
red swath uh in
a sea of blue uh which
is low nox data, the
higher nox data that you
see is coming from the
path side next to
us. Uh We have made sure
that it's not a distant source.
Uh The data clearly indicate
that it is the paths side next
to us. That is the source of these nitrogen
oxides. It's about 500
ft away but produces
even on the long term
average, very clear
plumes of
nitrogen oxides
and we're
reasonably
confident that
the flair that
is operating on a regular
basis at that site is
the source of these nitrogen
oxides.
So this gives you an idea
that uh if you
live next to one of these pad
sides, one of the things
that you can see, but
that's regularly
present, there is
pollution plumes. In this case,
it's a nitrogen oxide
plume. Uh But we also
observe hydrocarbons
um coming from
that
site
on the next slide. Uh I'm
giving you an overview
of uh ethane.
Ethane is a
hydrocarbon.
Uh that in atmospheric
chemistry, we use as a
marker uh for
oil and gas production,
there is
essentially no
other significant source
of ethane to the atmosphere other
than the
human production,
extraction of fossil
fuels from the ground.
So when you observe
ethane in the atmosphere,
it's an indirect marker that
you have a site
of
oil and gas exploration somewhere
close to you. Ethane is very
long lived in the
atmosphere.
So
it is not
consumed during
transport even when the
site is potentially
several tens of miles
away from
you. Uh In this
comparison uh to
data from Colorado, you
see that uh
at Loving, the fa levels
are substantially
higher, uh 10
to 30 times
higher than
what you observe in,
in Colorado. The main
reason for this enormous
difference is the fact
that at our outside, in
Loving uh we
are surrounded
by oil and
gas production. Uh Of
course, and it is
therefore
closer to us
proximity and
there's many more sites
density uh
as compared to the
Colorado sites. Uh We
have done a rough
evaluation uh
of this proximity and
density and it shows
that at the Colorado sites,
there's about 10 times
less uh oil
and gas exploration
activity close
to these monitoring
locations.
So uh this
clearly shows that proximity
and density make a large
difference in terms
of what you are exposed
to. Um if you
live there. Uh
And there are people
living in the middle of,
of the oil and gas
field
on the next page, uh You
see a time
series, um
I'm showing you ethane
and on this slide,
methane,
because they are
clear markers
uh for oil and
gas production,
they are also highly
correlated to almost
all other hydrocarbons
that we
measure at this
site.
So by
that, I want to make sure
that you're not
interpreting methane here
as one particular
compound. It's essentially
a stand in
for virtually all
the other hydrocarbons that
we observe. This is somewhat
unusual because there
are of course large sources
other than oil and
gas that put
hydrocarbons in the atmosphere.
But in this particular environment
where we are measuring
the vast
uh amount,
uh 90 more than
90% of all the
hydrocarbons we observe in the
air are oil and gas
related
hydrocarbons.
Now, there's three things
on that on a time series I'm
showing here. Uh One
is uh what I marked
on the lower right end of the
graph as the background,
this is the level
of methane you observe in clean
air. And you can see that
uh even in loving uh
we observe uh clean
air a few
times a year.
So that background
level is at about
1900 P
PB. In this case,
the second thing you see
is a lot of up and down,
there's a lot of what we
call spikes or in this
case, plumes
of methane that
go as high
as 10 times
on, on
short time scales, the
natural background in
this environment.
Um If you, if
I had shown you a time series
of another site
such as from Colorado, you would
see the spice as well, but they
are very
infrequent.
What you see here is a very
high frequency
of these plumes.
And that is
an
indication
in our viewpoint that we have
a lot of different
sources all around
us. These plumes
are not coming from one
particular direction. They are
basically coming from all
directions
and they also
appear at
all times of day.
So they're not particular
to one
site that is
at X distance
and that emits y amount
of hydrocarbons. It appears
like we see
these plumes of hydrocarbons
in the air on a
regular basis from virtually
all directions. It's
again an indicator of
the proximity and density
of of oil and gas
exploration in this
area.
Um The big yellow
line in there is simply an
indicator of the long
term median
uh levels of
methane uh in
there which is
on the order of 50%
above uh the
natural
background.
Moving on to the second
aspect of our
measurements. Uh We have
one central site
uh at uh in
Loving where we
do high
time resolution
measurements on an hourly
basis for most compounds
on a minute basis. Uh
For many other compounds.
I'm not showing any of the high
resolution data. The
second aspect of
our measurements is what
we call passive
sampling uh with
the help of a volunteer
uh who's in the audience
here. Uh Josie, are
you here? Could you
stand up for a second?
Uh Josy
helps us with
um
distributing on a
weekly basis
samples
uh and
private properties in
the area uh where
people monitor what they are
exposed to um
at where they
live. Uh Passive
sampling is a established
methodology. We have a turnaround
of about 5 to 10 days
depending on uh when
Josie is able to go
and switch out uh the
samples uh before she
mails them to me
uh in college
station.
The next slide shows
the results of this uh
passive sampling.
And uh what you
see here is each bar
is essentially one of the
samples uh
sites uh
color coded.
And uh the length of the
bar is how long it was
deployed in the field
approximately one week.
Uh What you see is that
in summer values are typically
lower in winter values
are higher. Uh But
what you can also see is that
there's a significant
variation between
sites, right, the
lowest sites uh towards
the bottom of the graph
uh show values that
are commonly measured
in uh urban areas
such as Houston
and I gave a gray swath
there of typical values
annual average uh
values of
in this case, uh the hydrocarbon
benzene that are measured in
Houston
uh at the top of that,
uh you see a
dash line which I
marked uh
who
guidance.
That's the
level of benzene the
World Health Organization
considers uh
as a guidance
value. In this case, it's a
reference to
the fact that benzene is
a known carcinogen
and the exposure, the
lifetime exposure to
benzene may lead to
one uh extra
case of
cancer uh in
100,000 people
if exposure to half
of P PB is
maintained throughout the lifetime
of that
population.
Uh What you can see is
that virtually all values
are above that
value. Uh that
guidance value even
in the
summertime when
we expect these hydrocarbons
to be lowest in
the atmosphere.
Moving on to the second
aspect, I'd like to talk
about which is uh ozone.
Uh What you're looking
at here is a
uh annual time
series of uh
ozone values
so called ozone design values.
That's the metric uh The
EPA uses to determine
if a area
is in violation of the national
ambient air quality standard,
which we call the
AX uh
counties has been in violation
of this standard since
2018
and there is no improvement in
sight. Uh Currently,
uh you
move to the next page
which gives a map
of uh ozone
tendencies
uh in the United States.
You can see that Eddie
County is an outlier.
Eddie County is the only
place in the nation
where the next
is the ozone is
both violated and not
decreasing. But in fact
still uh slightly
increasing by the time this
report came
out, this is a
map produced by the
EPA. Uh
So this is highly
unusual. Uh
And we were
actually not prepared for this. We
were not
um
uh
in knowledge of this before we
started this project.
So, uh
bad preparation on our
side. Um
What I want to highlight on the
next slide is that
this violation
is not
an outlier in any
way. It is
very common.
Uh The na
for ozone is
violated in this county
on a regular basis. In
fact, it was violated
yesterday, um
which you can look
up under the
web page that
I gave you at the beginning of my
talk in
2013
and loving, there were
31 days
when ozone was above
70 PPP.
This is very similar
to the measurements that
me is
carrying out uh in
calls bar. Um
The number of days is slightly
different. We're currently
analyzing
where this
difference is coming
from
A A, we currently
observe a few more
violations deeper
into the oilfield than
further north in
Carlsbad.
One minute ozone values,
uh, have been observed to go
up over 100
P PB. So that is
becoming, uh,
unhealthy.
Where's the high ozone coming from?
Uh, we are
reasonably sure
that, uh, oil and
gas industry emissions of
both the fuel A K A
hydrocarbons and
the catalyst A K A
knock emissions
are responsible for
this. Uh One clear
hint is the map.
Uh the so-called polar
plot, that colorful
plot on the next
page which
shows that ozone values
are typically
highest when the wind
is relatively weak
and was coming out of the
Southeast. This is
highly consistent with
um
a ongoing
study at Carlsbad
National Caverns
um where measurements
were carried out in 2017,
2019 and
2021
funded by
the USDA,
which also showed that
hydrocarbons from the
industry and knock from
the industry is likely
the major source for
ozone formation
in the
area.
Last a quick
overview of
uh known health effects
of the compounds
that I talked about. Uh
in this case, nitrogen
oxides, ozone
and benzene and
other
hydrocarbons.
Uh You can see
this as a take this as
a qualitative um
not quantitative
measurement here.
These health effects
are reasonably well
established. Uh They
are especially
concerning uh
for people who have pre-existing
conditions, uh the
elderly, uh and
Children,
the second to last
slide, uh goes
briefly over
some more
specifics uh of the
health effects. Mostly
most of them are
respiratory. But there's also
a growing database
that uh long
term exposure to
emissions from the
industry uh appear
to have
uh
um effects
on the
unborn um lead
to premature births and low
birth weights.
For example, uh
childhood leukemia
is one of the
concerns uh
increased blood pressure,
but they are also
what you might call minor
health effects. Uh One
very common one that
uh virtually everyone
I've ever talked
to who has
been exposed to
uh oil and gas,
very close to them is talking
about namely
nosebleeds.
In summary.
Um What we
find is that the air
quality at the
location we are measuring
south of Carlsbad is
very poor.
Uh There are
frequent high pollution
plumes of hydrocarbons. Uh
the most concerning being
benzene because it is a
known
carcinogen.
And on top of that, these
emissions lead to secondary
ozone formation,
which has led to the
violation of the ozone
national ambient air quality
extended in the area
uh for six
years and
ongoing. Thank
you very
much.
>> Turn it over to Doctor Tammy mcmullin
now.
All right. Can you hear
me
maybe speak just a little bit
louder? Let me
just a little bit.
Is that better?
Good. Ok,
good morning. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
Thank you members,
the committee for
inviting me to speak
today. My
name is Tammy Doctor mcmullin.
Yes, that's it.
That's the one
CTH.
There you go.
OK.
I'll make sure everybody's got it. We
all have it. So we're ready to go,
ready to go.
All right, it's just with the
great honor to be given this opportunity
to be able to speak on
the science of oil and gas
setbacks in public
health.
Um So
I'm gonna first just tell you a
little bit about me and my
experience. So you understand where I'm
coming from.
Uh First of
all, I'm not an atmospheric
scientist. Uh
I'm an exposure scientist
and public health risk
assessor. I got
my phd at Colorado
State University Environmental
Health uh worked
in industry for a while
and then uh decided
that uh it would, I really
wanted to work on issues that
matter to my state in
Colorado had
an opportunity
to
join the Colorado
Department of Public Health
start up a program
there because we went through the
process of kind of what you guys are
going through and deliberating what the
concerns were.
And there were heightened concerns
around the impacts
to oil and gas operations
and proximity to where people
lived. You can imagine
in Colorado and Denver
about a decade ago,
we had about 10,000 people
moving to the front range a
month
at the same time, you have.
So you have massive
development and land
use issues in
parallel with
massive growth of oil and gas
in the same area. So this
is like very real
and personal to me. And it's
something that I've spent the last
decade working on and understanding
from a health perspective.
Uh It also
matters to me because I'm a mom of
three kids that live in an
area. We have ozone non
attainment issues in the front
range. These are big
issues that are complex and
aren't just related to oil and
gas, they're related to
mobile sources and traffic.
And so there's like, it's, you have to
think about all these different sources
when you're thinking about public health impacts,
especially when you're
looking at developing policies
that will actually be effective
when it comes to reducing these
concerns.
So I'm here today
as you know, Tammy
mcmullin is an individual
who lives in Colorado that's gone through some of
these experiences and I hope to bring
you some science
uh information around
this.
So on slide
three
if there's anything that I want
you to take home
from, from this
today. And as you
consider what you
hear moving forward
around this area,
there is no one
size fits all
solution
to answering a public health
concern related to oil and gas
development production.
Uh
What do I mean by
this?
I mean that first as I show you
the picture on the left,
which is from E P's most
recent draft of cumulative
impact assessments and
how to assess public
health impacts in a cumulative
perspective. Not just air
quality,
you need to consider
quality of life and
well being factors,
those include
but are not limited to air
quality or water quality. It
includes your built
environment,
homes,
offices, people
that work there, your natural
environment, yes, the air that we
breathe, the water we drink
and your social structure,
meaningful jobs,
good education
schools systems,
all of these things are important.
Public health concepts that
you um
evaluating it from an economic
standpoint need to consider
about the entirety of the well
being of your
communities.
So developing policy related
to oil and gas and
health in
my opinion,
should consider the impacts of
all of these facets of your well
being
next slide.
So today,
what I'd like to do, I'm gonna just
give you three main
kind of topics.
I'm gonna talk to you about the story
of public health in
oil and gas in Colorado because
I think it's really relevant as to why
there's even a conversation that
setbacks, which is a
land use situation
at a local government level.
Um has come to
be, I'm gonna
talk to you about the scientific evidence
of what we know to date
and then some considerations
that you can take home with you
to think
about.
OK, so slide
five first, I'm gonna start
with the story. What did we do
and how did Colorado
get where we are today
with our
setbacks?
So before
2014,
uh I had no, I
was watching this as a
citizen and community
member in Colorado.
Uh fracking happening
across our front
range.
There was an interesting
dynamic. We had exponential
increase of oil and gas
development in
parallel with accommodating
massive population
growth. We
had increased local
community concerns,
environmental human health
impacts and proximity to oil
and gas operations just like you
guys are experiencing
here. We have
local jurisdictions
that all thought differently
about it. They develop,
you know, they had different revenue streams
from it. And
so local districts
started to revisit the adequacy
of their current environmental
regulations or
perhaps their land use
regulations.
And so interestingly because
local governments have control
over land use
and planning here
enters your setback
discussion that you
could regulate this at a local
level through
your concerns. Well,
there's an increase as we
saw in disparate
conflicting local
regulations
like setbacks,
unclear evidence about
the effectiveness of those
regulations to actually solve
the problem of concern about public
health.
So as I shared earlier,
we had this really interesting
complex dynamic that a lot of
factors had to take
place and
consider. Slide.
Seven
here enters public policy
and public health
at the time, Governor Hickenlooper
recognized there
were all of these multiple
factors.
Uh all of these players were
not getting along very well
and it was becoming a pretty contentious
situation.
So he saw that it
was quickly becoming a result
in any type of regulation
that would be very prescriptive
and one size fits
all would.
According to uh his
executive order in 2014,
stated that it would become
adversarial,
cumbersome, time
consuming and very expensive
process to our
state.
And so with that,
it was
interesting
that at that
time,
the state versus local
jurisdiction over these
regulations became
a really a big
concern. You had
environmental regulations, land
regulations, public health
regulations, economic
benefits to the state,
all of those pieces making
sure that we had improvement in
ensuring the well being of our
citizens in Colorado.
So Hickenlooper
decided there was a real need for
collaborative, coordinated
problem solving
with all stakeholders at the
table to figure out a
solution that was
sustainable.
So understanding
the complexity of this issue, the
tensions, we started to get
lawsuits
where uh local
governments were suing the
Oil and Gas Commission
uh industry consortiums
were then suing the local governments
because of preempts, rules
and rights to minerals,
etcetera that all
have to be considered. And
from my perspective, in
about a decade of doing
science to inform
policy,
there's a really
important to
have good
strong scientific
evidence to
me with minimal
uncertainty before you
develop a policy that's gonna have a
huge impact on
your state.
So one way the
governor could deal with this
situation is through an
executive order. So he made
an executive order
to say there needed to be about
20 plus people on a task
force. All
coming from different stakeholder
uh positions.
And their goal, as
I say in slide 10
is to identify and
strive to reach agreement
on recommendation for
policy or legislation to
harmonize state and local
regulation
structures
as to activities associated
with oil and gas
operations.
So what
happened?
Strategy and policy
development among slide
11.
Well, the
task force came back
with a set of recommendations quite
quickly actually.
And they realize this
is an important local issue.
Every community is
unique. Carlsbad
is unique here, Eddie County,
right? I mean, I've just driven from
Albuquerque down
here and I mean,
you go from urban areas
down to here, you have to be
very cautious about
how you are regulating
something. When this becomes a
very important issue
at a local level for your
citizens, they all have
different needs, they all
have different voices and that's
an important piece
to this.
So in addition
to regul to to
recommending additional
funding for enforcement
activities, so
they looked at what are our existing
regulations already? How
are we enforcing
safety of public
health in our state
already? What are we
already doing? And are,
is there a limitation
in it because there's not adequate
funding to
enforce.
Uh they added more
monitoring.
We established a state program
to dive deep into the science
and what it was telling us. And so
this is where I entered into
the picture.
So from there, I went
from seeing
it every day as a citizen
to having the opportunity
to join the state health Department
inform this oil and Gas
Public Health program. At that
time.
On slide, 12, we
had four
recommendations
that we uh implemented
when I was there at the state. It
was an interagency
program
because we needed to work with the
Oil and Gas Commission,
uh which is part of our
Department of Natural Resources
because they permit oil and
gas. We needed to work with
our environmental department because
they regulate oil, oil and gas
and air quality. And I
needed to work with all the smart
scientists in the Public Health Department,
epidemiologists, all of
those experts
to bring the science
together. So
first, we needed to increase
funding for inspections.
So what do I mean by that?
Well, what Doctor Shade just spoke
about those cameras, the
flare cameras, those
are part of existing
regulations across all
states including New Mexico to
be using for
inspections. Uh
not only that but operators
use those on a very regular
basis. In
fact, it's already
written into regulations that the
closer you are in proximity
to populations, the more
frequently you have
to do those inspections.
So these are all things you need to
understand and consider of
what existing regulations
exist to already protect
public health.
So we did that. We also
administered, we had
already just
uh
promulgated rules for
new air quality regulations.
And so
uh our, our governor,
um all of the state council
understood, well, we need to make sure
that those are implemented and that
they're strong and
enforceable. For
example, I know that
um you just had an ozone
precursor rule making,
I believe, to deal
with ozone and to understand
and address this issue. It's
important, you
look at that and understand
what that's already going to start
to regulate in your taxpayer
money going to that to ensure
that that's regulated and
are there gaps in
it?
Third, develop a, we could
develop a complaint and response
program. Again, I can't
emphasize enough the importance
of hearing local
voices
about the issues that matter
to them here. And that's, I
guess why you guys are all the way down
here, right? From Santa
Fe,
we, we needed
to collect a lot of
data.
You guys are the committee
that look at data and
things. So you got to
have solid
data.
So also
I was charged and my
team with doing a state
of the science review
building upon what did we already
know this isn't new.
Lots of states have been doing this
for a long time.
We knew and we reviewed the
scientific evidence in fact,
I even spoke at that time at the
Health Effect Institute like the work
that you guys are on ongoing
and they have wonderful work that's going
on to continue
to understand
uh the information where we
had identified back in
2014 and 15 through the
Health Effects Institute,
the concerns and the
gaps.
Ok. So now I'm gonna put
on my science hat
and we're gonna talk a little bit
about what do we mean about the science with
setbacks?
Uh So on
slide
14,
I'm sure that you all use
various frameworks as
economists on how
you look at policy, how you
drive policy
based on data and
decisions
as public health
experts uh
particularly in the area
of what are we concerned about from chemical
exposures and
health. We use
established public health
frameworks.
You can collect a bunch of data,
you can collect air data,
you can measure it and you can
say it's above a number
and say that that's a health
concern. That's not the way
it works.
It's a little bit more complicated than
that or I guess it wouldn't have gotten a
phd in this
area.
So you
take, you have a
question, do
operations
development and production, whether it be
emissions, water discharges,
produced water, whatever you're
concerned about, you need
to understand. Does that impact
public health? First of
all, you need to understand what's coming from the
source, how
it's released.
But then what is an exposure
mean just because you measure something
in there does not equate
to an exposure from an exposure
scientist standpoint,
what matters is how much,
how long,
what chemical it is,
how frequent.
And so you have to consider all of those things
and where people live because it's
not an exposure. If you're measuring the air
right next to a source, nobody
breathes the air right
next to a
pipeline
and they don't live there.
So we identify that and if we
don't have enough information, you've got
to connect all these dots that
I show you in that link.
So you can say a
source links
to a health effect
based on how close somebody
lives to a
site.
But you can see that there's a bunch
of other information and
data. We need
to link that
right. Otherwise it's not
causal. It's an
association
that you have to consider what other
factors could be contributing
to those health
outcomes.
Slide. 15.
So you like
numbers. I like numbers too.
So we quantify
that's called a human health risk
assessment in the world of public
health.
One piece of what we do
is quantifying how
much could
somebody be exposed to? What are
our chemicals of concern? Like
Dr Shade said,
uh and, and I, he's
absolutely right. It's pretty
uh clear benzene
is a driver of risk
when it comes to oil and
gas. But
because it's present doesn't
mean it's a health
risk. You
need to understand factors
that would contribute to that.
Right.
So we want to know how much
we want to know at
what point does it become a
concern? Where do we observe
effects such as
uh
nosebleeds or
asthma or cancer
for chemicals?
And then what are people actually really
being exposed to compared to where we
see effects?
And then what does that mean? And we
give numbers
to risk managers
and essentially all of you
are becoming risk managers
today. At
this point, you're
managing what I'm
gonna give you is information about the
science. And
then you're gonna integrate that
in with social
implications, economic
implications, technical
information beyond
the scope of this. And we,
what it means and
how you manage
that.
The first question, I guess I
would uh suggest
to all of you is to really make sure,
you know, is there a
risk? And what
does that mean?
Not that there's a hazard that
there's a presence of something that is
emitted? Because we all know
every single type of
indus industrial
source or mobile
sources and we
drive cars, all of these
emit something into
the air.
So just because you can
detect it, you need to
go beyond that and ask a little
bit more
slide 16, I
just, I'm going I list and
I probably already spoke about
him.
It's just for your information, the
types of questions we
ask. When you
hear information about
something as toxic
and harmful,
there's a lot of key questions we
have to know. So that all means
you better have the data for
it.
How likely is it that somebody
would be experiencing
these kinds of harms?
For example, when we talk
about or you may hear
spikes, we measured a
spike.
Well, we don't really use the term
spike in the world of exposure
assessment. A
spike. I don't know what that
means is an instantaneous
measure of something in the
air. I mean,
I, I fill up my car with
gas and get an instantaneous
spike of something.
You know, you there's
several things that we do. So
you have to take and say, well,
what, what does that mean? How much,
how long,
where, how
frequent
a spike of
methane
at the same concentration
as a spike of Benze means a
lot. Totally
something different to us as public
health
scientists.
So I want to spend a little bit of time, I
think on slide
17, I'm gonna
walk you through what I mean?
Let's make it a little bit more
real.
I think it's a good one that
why don't we go ahead and pull up just
so we can explain. And I
love what all
that fantastic data that
dr shade has collected
so far. And it's
because those are really important
studies. So let's see what's really
happening locally
here.
A
on the slide
that doctor sheed
presented, uh
that says passive sampling
network and he shared a lot about
the benzene concentrations
and what you're measuring
here.
I'll let you just take a second to get
to his
death.
So
it's a pretty robust data
set
from what I've,
what I heard is each
of those little dots
represent an
average over one
week. So
I've been thinking about
this,
let's talk about like a
budget.
If I were to
say
my daily expenditure,
I my budget's
$10,000 for
a year
I, you
know, spent,
but that's an average,
it's averaged over an entire
year. So my daily
spending may
go up and down.
I may try to
stay below
that budget and maybe spend
an average amount so that
divided by 12 I
meet or below my
budget.
But I may on one
day really feel like
going to Nordstroms and having a spending
spree. So I
may use up a good 75%
of my budget in one day.
Do I say that I'm not
going to make my budget
for the year? Not yet.
So you have to understand
about
uh how like
duration matters,
right? So what it
means on a spike for one
week, you
don't compare that, for
example, like
here to
that dotted line
of a long term lifetime
exposure. And that
below that line,
this is the World Health Organization,
but we typically use EPA S
values because that's in the US
here. The
long term line means
that that level essentially
means that you could be
exposed to a
concentration of benzene
24 hours a day,
seven days a week
as though you lived and breathed
outside all day
long, all night
for a lifetime of 70
years and not have
harm.
Another example of the
way you need to really think about the
data
is this
is one piece. So a one
week average,
typically what we would do as risk
assessors would
be to compare that
to another short
term, it would make more sense to compare
your monthly budget to like a monthly
number or a daily
budget.
So it it I
would say I'd take a look at this
data as a risk assessor and
say,
well, you're
below all
of your short term guideline
values. So
when you look at my slide on
17, I want to just explain
to you what we mean by numbers
when we say something's above a
number.
So typically
the risk management range
for some type of data like
this, especially.
So the CDC
here in the US
has a agency
that uh evaluates
public health
uh and they look
at numbers and they uh develop
health based numbers.
So the CD C's number for
something like this on a short term is
nine.
So it appears to me
like all the data that's been
collected here
um is really
about
two thirds. It's
below what
we would consider a safe level of
exposure for those
durations.
So it's
important again to
understand
what you're looking at in the data
in context. It's not
as simple and that's
just the main take home
because this is a lot to be
given to you guys. And
so you need to probably relate,
you know, also be ensuring
that you're working with the environmental
department, your Public Health
Department to
evaluate some of that
data.
So
let's take a
look.
Uh I'm gonna skip because we've
already kind of talked about it.
We did some, we did a lot of
similar work like what you guys are
seeing here in Colorado and I have
that there and I've given references
on slide 18.
Let's just move quickly to slide
19.
So I'm gonna shift from what we measure
in the air and looking at the
probability of
harm happening, which
is what we do when we
compare numbers and say whether
it's above or below it.
Now, let's talk about what
it means when we say that
uh
uh there's health uh
like
outcomes, right? People
like higher rates of
birth defects
or respiratory
effects or
nosebleeds in a
community of people
that live also in an oil and
gas area. That's what we call an
association,
right? You happen to live close
to oil and gas
and you also may, may
or may not have higher rates of
something.
Uh I've
looked at thousands
of these studies that have been collected
and continue to be the da the
data are
continuing to be published.
And it's really important that we have that
information. It's a piece but
only one piece of
information.
So
when we would take a thorough look
at all of the studies
together and Health Effects
Institute did that
and I've given the link there for
that
the majority of these
studies,
even if they've been published
recently, first off,
um may not
be reliable
and translatable to
actual current operations
today. Some of these
studies have been done way back
in 2014, relying on
data that were as old as like
2008. I
mean, it's clear
technology and the way we
operate because of new regulations,
etcetera, you cannot
translate that directly to meaningful
information about the way
we uh
and the you know,
the regulations in oil and gas
operations today.
Second, it's important to
understand that studies
that just look at distance as
a proxy of a
measurement of exposure.
Um and look at distance of
where somebody lives or
something like that
comes with a lot of
confounders. So there's
uncertainty in that,
which is understood by the
entire, you know, scientific
community and even the authors of
those types of
studies.
So
it's important to just
understand
that distance from a well pad does
not equal an exposure,
measuring something in the air
does not equal an
exposure
and distance from a Well, Pad does
not equal a causal
relationship between one
type of
operation
and a health
effect.
So
it's my
professional opinion
on reviewing the science over
the last decade on being a part
of collecting the data and the science
that what we know to
date
is that there is not
consistent.
Uh
There's not uh high
confidence
in the data, it's
inconsistent, there's not
strong evidence that there's
increased specific
health outcomes
uh
uh from
oil and gas operations,
especially those that link to the
ones that have been associated with
distance
and all that to say that there
is no one magical
number for a
setback,
you could develop a setback
number and
regulate that. Although
every operation is gonna
look different, every
company operates
differently. Uh
Geography is different,
you can't translate what's
been done somewhere else.
Uh you know, to
here.
So when you look at the evidence, even of the
air studies in
Colorado, I mean, what I
just looked at fresh off,
you know, like here, fresh off the press
that some of the preliminary data you
guys are being able to collect
locally.
I it
doesn't seem like there's
evidence of increased health
risks. So I'm
gonna show you
lastly.
Uh
Well, let me, let me just back up here
really quick. If I have just a couple
of more minutes, I want to share slide
20 back to
Colorado story.
OK. So for
a few years, we
collected a bunch of data, we
were told by the Governor
to, uh,
develop the program. We
collected the data.
I've told you is I'd still,
uh, continue to
collect additional data. I've
been on,
uh, I don't know, dozens of
well pads, personally
collecting data on the
pads in
proximity. I've
collected tens of thousands
of data points and aggregated them
throughout Colorado and still
to date
the health department, uh,
data we've collected,
uh, as scientists, we
have not found any
consistent evidence
that there's harm being
done.
The concentrations
of some of these chemicals including
benzene can be much higher
in urban areas where there is no
oil and gas because
you have a lot of
sources.
So it's something to
consider.
So what happened next and why
did Colorado get to 2000
ft?
It's not a magical number.
I was uh
oversaw the
studies that got us
to 2000 ft.
We did some hypothetical
modeling studies
to look at risk based
on our geography,
how we operate at the
time
and what we found were
hypothetically under very
worst case scenarios.
Uh There were
situations where the
concentrations of benzene
could get above those
short term numbers.
So short term
effects,
concerns about cancer,
those types of risks we did
not find under certain situations
that those would be occurring even
beyond 2000
ft.
What did the commission do?
Well, so
let me step back is what
happened is we never
wrote a law
that said there needed to be a mandated
setback. It was not a
prescriptive law.
This was all through executive
order through collaborative
stakeholder
engagement.
Until
Change of Guard, we had some
other changes we were
demonstrating with the
science and
then s um
staple. Uh in
2019,
uh 181 was
passed
uh that uh
mandated uh
the oil and gas
commission, the Public Health Department
and other agencies
uh to evaluate
the science and to
ensure that we were
operating and regulating oil
and gas to minimize
public health impacts.
Again, even
181 was not
prescriptive. It said
to evaluate existing
setbacks and the
evidence, it did not say
what number needed to be
used.
They used the evidence of what
we had generated of the science.
We had a lot of data to
bring to the table.
We went through a rulemaking
process with where all
the stakeholders were engaged
at the commission rulemaking
where we could bring the scientific
evidence, they could understand
it and digest it and
consider it along with other
regulations.
And so they also
did 2000 ft
setback
with
the ability to have a
variance on an
operator in an area
specific. It, it
meant local governments
could have a say in
that uh
operators with
data to demonstrate
minimizing public health
impacts uh
have frequently been able to
get variances from
that. And they make,
they may put in there where they
do additional monitoring because
they're close in proximity to homes
to ensure that there's public health
protection. And so
there was a lot done. It wasn't
black and white like that
and it makes sense because it's a complex
issue with multiple
factors.
Ok. Lastly,
what does this mean
to all of you?
Uh,
on slide
22
the reason I bring this up
is that
get information, what
existing regulations
do you have in place
to minimize emissions at
the source? Right? It all starts
there. If you minimize
methane or ethane,
you're minimizing benzene
too. Uh
You're ensuring that
those
what happened a while
ago in the regulations federally
have changed your
state regulations change.
So these are important pieces to the
conversation.
I'll leave that.
Uh Let's move to slide 24
as a scientist, how would I start
to look at all of this and say, what
do we see? Let's
take a look at what we see just right here
in Carlsbad, what's going on in
your state? What are the
environmental, what's the
environmental department already doing?
What's the Public Health department already
doing?
So, for example, on site
24
in addition to the data that
these team of
scientists are
collecting,
it appears to me like New Mexico
Environmental Department is
doing specialized
benzene uh
monitoring projects
here. They already understand the
concerns.
They have an air monitoring
station in
Carlsbad right
here. It reports
out very high frequency
continuous data on
these kind of chemicals we're concerned
about related to oil and
gas
and they
state, according to what's publicly
available, that if data
indicate a significant
risk,
uh that NMND
would consider regulatory
strategies to mitigate that
risk.
So, for example,
they've identified very specific
goals
uh around what they're
going to do with that data. That's
important. I I
mean, from a taxpayer
perspective, there's money
that's going into investigating
this. It's important that you use
all the data existing
and available to you
to understand the,
the the
information
it looks like part of their goals are to
understand the ambient air quality
where people are living
in Carlsbad.
And then that way you can develop new
rules and regulations if
needed.
How about slide? 25? I
think I've kind of gone over
this. But it's another
example of what do we mean
when we think about benzene, we don't
look at individual spikes
of something but
on slide 25 when you correctly
average the data
that nmnmed
have available on their
website,
you look at what is benzene
in Carl's bed right
now. It paints a bit of a
different story than
looking at the data
with uh misinformation
around the wrong health guideline
values being compared to short
term values in
2023. According to this
data, all one
hour benzene measurements
are below the short term health
protective com comparison
values
benzene would not be expected
under these conditions to cause
short term health effects to a person
that would breathe that level of
air even
for example, I even put
the lifetime exposure
by EPA
there, which is
nine so even
continuously over long
times,
it still doesn't appear
initially to have non
cancer health effects and
non cancer risks.
So that's just one example of the
type of environmental data that
are used to look
at. Do we have a problem or
not? Lastly on
slide
26
Your State Public Health
Department
is one of a
few
states in the
country that
clearly then sought out
additional funding
from the CDC
in order to have an environmental
tracking program. I know about
this because I oversaw it when
I was in Colorado
and it, it takes a lot of
work to apply for
these and you get money
that the state doesn't have to
provide and you
get money to be able to track
health outcomes in
communities in your
state. So
you don't just look at what's measured in the
air because this gives us a
probability that something
could possibly happen.
When you look at air
measurements, you want
to look at health outcomes. Here's
an example. So
benzene, why are we
concerned about benzene?
Well,
mainly short term
cancer, benzene is
one of those that's pretty well known to
be a carcinogen at really
high con high
concentrations typically
over
lifetimes.
So if we're concerned about benzene,
there's a very specific type of
cancer, it can cause
specific type of
leukemia.
So what do you look at? You
look at the health outcome data
in communities like an oil and gas
community here
and that's I just show you a picture, you
won't be able to read it from there,
but it's publicly available.
They've, they analyze the
data, they compare the data
to your state, they compare
the data to other
counties.
And you actually see in Eddie
County here that the incident
rates of blood cell cancers are
similar or lower in Eddie County
than state averages.
So something
I if if
people are being exposed to
extremely high toxic levels
of something, you're going to start to
see it in your health outcome
data. That's why we do
surveillance as public health
experts. So
something doesn't connect
the dots.
So lastly,
here's a few
takeaways.
I think there's a lot of multiple lessons
to be learned.
There were limitations in what we
did in Colorado and there's still
limitations in the study. You will
always have to make decisions based
on imperfect information.
And as public health experts, we
have to do too. And it
becomes more of a
philosophical policy
piece of understanding
how you manage multiple
priorities in your
state.
Environmental data collected in
communities near oil and gas
development. When you look at them
cohesively across
states
over time, have not
been consistently
demonstrating levels of concern
in the air for adverse
health effects.
Second, health
outcome studies are largely
inconsistent. They
lack cohesiveness of their
specific findings
and they're not. And we
never designed
to show causal evidence of
oil and gas and health
outcomes.
I'd say third health studies
from other states can
be useful, but
I need to
emphasize caution
has to be taken as to its
applicability right
here in the state.
And in Carlsbad
specifically.
And it's my opinion that a
policy mandating a
prescriptive one size
fits all setback
is not your answer
to a multifaceted public
health issue. It
really needs to be a systematic
process.
So with that, I'm done.
Thank you, Chair
and the committee for listening.
Thank >> you, Representative
of Sarana.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
Thank you all for your
presentations.
Uh Much appreciate
it. So I want to start with
DOCTORSD,
right? So when
we, she was comparing us to
Colorado, what's the difference in the
number of, what's the
difference in the number of extraction
sites between the two and
how would that affect the
data?
>> Um Thank you for
your question. Uh
Representative Sania,
um
I actually don't have
uh numbers, big numbers.
Um but
Austin actually mentioned a few
at the beginning in terms of
number of wells
um in
Colorado,
uh there
is
also high number
density of wells, but most
measurements are not
carried out very
close
to where
the well activity
is. When
you look at
um that
proximity, you do
find that
the closer you go
to the oil and gas area,
the higher the concentrations
are. So
I I want to actually
comment on the data that she
showed in her presentation, namely
the BTX data that NMT
is collecting here in
calls for when
you look closer at that date at
these data, which
we have a half a year of
data roughly only from
that site right now,
you clearly see
two things. One,
it's quite
far actually from the
nearest oil and gas exploration
activity. It sits
on the west side
of Carlsbad and
the west is much
cleaner. We see that
same tendency in our
data,
the site
that is furthest
west
has much cleaner air
than on the east
side. So there's a clear
correlation with
proximity and density,
none of which is present
at the NM measurement
side. However,
when you look
closely, you can
clearly see that the highest
benzene levels are
transported to that side
with southeast winds.
So we know the oil and
gas area is the dominant
source of the
benzene. Having
said that uh on
average, um
the measurements at the call
site show similarly
low levels. Uh
then in
Houston, um
although
Houston obviously
has many more
people and much more
traffic, right?
So that's the other
thing that I think
was not right what you
said, namely, we do
not anymore
nowadays find high end
in values in urban
areas. Uh
And that is for
regulatory reasons
because epa
banned benzene from
gasoline and
that used to be a very dominant
source. Benzene has since
been dropping nationwide,
uh virtually
everywhere except
for where
we now find the dominant
sources which are
oil and gas related
sourcess.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Ok. Question.
Ok. Benzene
for us who aren't the
scientists? What
does it do
if it's, if, if we have
kids inhaling
benzene every
day or what does it do to
them?
>> That will be a question
for
doctor.
>> Yeah. II I enjoy
being able to have
these discussions because this
is a perfect example
of how it takes multiple experts
to come to the table and
understand
uh what, what we
mean by risk and, and
health. So benzene,
what does it do?
I'm gonna say
from, you have to understand
it depends on how much,
how long,
how frequent.
So you have to ask those kind of
questions.
Uh
It depends so short
term you can
have at
concentrations that may
be, I
don't know up to, I think I've got
it in there that could be hundreds of
thousands of times higher than
what you're measuring in your air.
Here
have been observed to
have headaches and
dizziness
over a few hours of exposure,
right? Think about like
workers or somebody that would be
in an environment that would be high
occupational
exposures.
>> Mr Chairman, can I give you an example?
So we have schools that are
surrounded by 100
and 5059.
Um not in, not in Carlsbad and
we're in Eunice but
59 extraction
surrounded by them schools,
a whole school district. What
will happen to those kids when they
go to school every day except
weekends, I mean,
every day. What
happens to them?
>> So
benzene expo. So
it, I have to know
how much is, how much
is in the air where they
are So, based on the
regional quality data,
depends on
uh typically
what your environmental department
or what we know our average concentrations
of benzene in the air
are at levels that
uh so
long term somebody's
breathing benzene in the
air over long term
times you
can have what we're concerned about
is cancer.
Leukemia.
It doesn't mean that any
benzene causes leukemia,
right? I
mean,
not every, you know,
drop of what you drink
with wine or whatever it may
be causes
and effects, you have to
understand how much.
And so the question would be, how
much is in the air?
What's the concentration?
And are you comparing it to
levels that
epa your
state, other
experts have
said are considered
levels safe levels of
exposure that could be,
you know, over those long periods of
time. And it's exactly
like what he's saying.
Benzene is a national
issue along with 100
other, actually almost
200 air toxics
that EPA and our states
manage uh
to evaluate the trends over
time because they usually come from a
lot of sources.
So that's what I'm
saying, Mr >> Chairman,
remember this is our state,
we have how many
wells, 70,000, over
70,000 wells being,
you know, extracting
oil and gas. So this
is constant. This
is,
it's happening here.
It just seems
like
you would be able to give me some kind
of answer with this many wells in
New Mexico, right? By
schools. >> What
will happen when you say right
by
>> like they're back, some of them are right
here. >> You can see we have the same
thing in >> Colorado. Not nearly
as many though, right?
>> Uh No, not
if you it depends on how many you mean.
I mean there, if you're talking about
within a certain distance, if you
look at our front range
in we county,
uh, in the area where people
were. I mean, I don't, I'd have to look at
numbers but,
but absolutely. And
that, what I'm saying
is,
uh, that's an important
issue. And so
that's also a very local
issue and you have to
understand those, those
factors, those questions that I put
in there. You have
to, you know
how much, how
much information do you have
to be able to know how much
there is in the air? Thank
you, >> Mr
Chairman. Again to
Dr
you talked about
hydrocarbons. You talked about
ozone. Can you give me more of an
explanation of what that means? What
they do to people, what they do to the
environment? What what
is, what makes them harmful or are
they harmful?
>> Right.
Complicated question.
Ok.
Um
Not every hydrocarbon
has the same effect
on your health.
So there's hydrocarbons
like ethane that we
don't in methane.
We don't know of any
direct health effects even at
very high concentrations
unless it replaces
oxygen in the air,
right? So
there's known deaths
that have occurred in the industry
where a worker
opens a hatch and he
gets a blast of hydrocarbons
which all by themselves
are not very
toxic, but it
takes the oxygen away.
Worker passes out.
No one finds him.
He may be still in
the area where the exposure is
high and may pass away.
So these extreme
cases have
occurred at very low
levels.
Um each of
these individual
hydrocarbons
um is not
likely to have an
immediate acute
health effect.
Um
So that's, that's with the
hydrocarbons directly, there
are a subset of
compounds which we call
air toxics
for
which we have higher
concern. And benzene
is one of those
because they are toxic
at much lower
levels at levels
that come close to the
level
that is normal.
So to say in the
air, right? So maybe only
a factor of 10 lower.
So, ergo, that's
when we start
comparing them to
this, who value or
other epa uh
values
that are considered
safe
and now safe.
Um is,
is a stretchy
word. OK.
Uh Let me give you an
example. Uh when
we consider cancer
uh the
who makes a clear statement,
there is no safe level of
benzene in the sense
that we can determine an
absolute level at
which
when we exposed to below
that level, we know there's not going
to be any cancers,
right? So at that
point, it becomes not a
scientific question but a
normative question,
right? How
many
uh cancer
extra cancers in a given
population are you willing to
accept? And that's
where opinions differ,
right? That's a normative
question. That's not something
we can answer by science
saying there is an
absolute level here and below
that there's no effects,
right? So
uh the science
cannot solve slash
answer all these questions.
>> So the Mr
Chairman, the hydrocarbons that are
here, do they
two LA is or what are the
carbons that do cause
harm to
humans that are
here in this
area?
>> Well, the one the
way it usually works and, and
you can look at Dr mcmillan's
works for that.
Um We
have some science
based values for
which we know that there
is some sort of a health
effect. So we have
uh they are typically called reference
values or guidance values,
right? So
measurements in
ambient air
um can be averaged
over time. So it's a long
term value, we average
over as long as we measured
hopefully at least a year
of data. So we
get some good
overview
and then we
ratio this
and we develop
an index from
that and
if that index is
stays
below one,
in other words,
that virtually means
that all our values
were below that
guidance value, those
guidance values, then
there's there's little
concern.
Alright, the risk is very
low.
If we get above,
if our index is above
one,
then
there's typically
uh that doesn't mean that
you're gonna suddenly have
like massive health effects in the
area, right? But your
risk level is higher and
you have some concern and you might want
to reduce your
emissions to
bring, bring that
concern slash
that risk level
back down.
So that's
uh that's it basically
in a nutshell. Uh What
I showed these
values that
go beyond the
who value
that would bring
that uh that
in up
high
oker
exposure and that might
create some higher concern.
It still remains a normative
decision on
whether you want to do
something about that.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
Um So, Doctor
Shape, um
how long have you been studying
here in New Mexico? All
your data is from here. How long have you been doing
it? >> Uh roughly
a year now at that site,
>> that site, do
you have anything else close or just,
just a >> year? I've
done some measurements
also in
Pecos
in south of Pecos,
which showed very
similar results,
high levels,
the deeper you go
into the oil
and gas production
area and
relatively low
values at the lower
end. Um
So we measured at one
of the state parks
on the southern end
of the Delaware Basin,
>> right? Mr Chairman and Mr
Shadd, how do the pollution
levels you've measured in loving
compared to other areas
you've measured besides
PCOS
>> naturally because
of the
proximity to the
source, they are very
much higher. And
for those
hydrocarbons
that are coming from the
industry, they are
very much lower for
other hydrocarbons, right?
So the one
hydrocarbon that many
of my colleagues including
myself only 10
years ago were mostly
interested in is
isoprene.
Isoprene is a naturally
emitted hydrocarbon to the
air. Uh and
it's coming from a
lot of trees
and it's very, it has
a very strong effect on atmospheric
chemistry, right?
We don't see any of that
around here because
we're far, far
from the sources of isoprene,
right? So
when we came here and
started these measurements,
essentially, we found, as
I said in my presentation,
all the hydrocarbons in the
air are essentially industry
uh of industry
origin
>> and Mr Chairman, one more question.
So ozone,
tell me more about ozone.
What, what, what I
know I went to cop 26
in, in Scotland.
And when I met people from all over the
world, they knew New Mexico
because of breaking bad and
because of the and because of the
ozone. So what, what
is the thing about the ozone,
>> um
ozone is very well studied in
terms of its health
impacts and
the science
has become clearer
over the decades, which
is one of the main
reasons why EPA has
continued to lower
the ozone national ambient air
quality standard because it became
clearer over the decades
that uh even
levels of 70 P
PB which were 30
years ago, not considered to
be having health
effects were shown to
have health
effects. So there's
a reason why we have a 70
P PB standard.
Um
We know the
chemistry of the atmosphere very
well in that
with respect to ozone
formation. And
so that's why I said in
my presentation that there
is very little doubt in my
mind that the
high abundance
of the particular
hydrocarbons that we see in this
area together with
the amount of
nitrogen oxides that we measure is
the origin of
these high ozone
values.
Um The
reason, the main
reason that
ozone has been dropping
virtually everywhere else
in the nation is that
we have put
regulations in place
about 20 years ago,
that reduced nitrogen
oxides emissions
from traffic
on the road.
And so everywhere where ozone
was previously measured
high, which was usually
close to urban
areas, uh
nox emissions have gone
down and
as a result of that,
we have brought
ozone down in many of these
regions.
Now, the chemistry is,
is quite complicated
in this particular case.
And uh what
our Coloradan colleagues
measurements at
Carlsbad Cavins showed
was that
if
in this area, you brought
nitrogen oxide emissions
down, you would have
a significant impact on
lowering ozone.
But the much more
efficient way to bring
ozone down would be to reduce
both the
hydrocarbon emissions and the
nox emissions.
So that's the current
status on
the signs in this particular
area.
>> Mr Chairman, I have a request,
one of his, >> the, one of
the, the young lady who works
with him >> um doing
his job and taking the measurements.
Could we hear just what, what
she's from this community?
Could we hear how it affects
her? The effects
of all the
emissions?
I, I'd, I'd
like to hear what
>> the health effect that she thinks caused
by that or is there some reason we
would? I'd >> like to
um >> I just
think she's >> from the community. I'd like to hear
what she has to say about all of
this Mr
Chair. >> Perhaps
we could ask
anything representative Sarinana
is wanting to ask Mr Chair
sort of what
the
volunteer has observed
during her time collecting
data, uh particularly
if there's been any health
effects that she's seen.
Perhaps.
Thank
you.
>> Firstly, I just
want to say thank you representative
and thank you Chairman Munoz
for giving me the time
to speak. It's
honestly a huge
honor to get to speak as
a resident of Carlsbad.
My name is Josie Dominguez
Zuniga and I live
in one of the areas we were speaking
about today. One of the
areas that is in
fact surrounded
by oil and gas.
There's a statement I would like to
address that I heard earlier that
was nobody lives at
the pipeline. No one is
absorbing this, you know,
these chemicals, these toxins
from the moment they wake up to the moment they
fall asleep. I would
like to say that that is incorrect
that I live at six
natural gas pipelines.
They run through the back of my
family's property
and not only
are there six natural gas
pipelines, but we are
also surrounded by
oil and gas activity.
Not only are there flares that
burn constantly
and of course at different
times around our home, but there
are also frack sites,
there are tank sites, there are battery
sites, there are wells, we
are completely and totally
surrounded in the Otis and
loving area. Now,
as for my time on this
project. There are things that
I would like to say that I have
observed. Um,
firstly, some of these
sites you can go to on a
Monday and on Monday it's
clear. It's a nice day.
By the following Monday,
you're back at your same site
here. And the
smell I want to talk
about just this
horrible smell that
burns your eyes. It burns your
nose, it burns your throat
and these smells are getting into
our homes. You, you can
smell it constantly when you
wake up, when you go to sleep.
And at these sites, as I said,
it differs from day to day, but
we are having constant
exposure at these sites
and we're seeing
now we have the information, we
have the numbers to see that. Yes,
it does vary from day to
day. But the exposure
is constant
and, um,
I think something we do need
to, you know, readdress
is the Children that
live at these homes. We're talking
about schools. What about the
Children who live at these homes?
And this is where they are constantly,
you leave school where you're under
the smoke of a flare and you get home
and you want to play outside with your
siblings. You want to go
and see your horse or your
dog, but there's smoke
and you don't feel well, I have a little
sister who is, is,
she's 12 years old now
around four or
five years ago. She started getting
these bloody noses,
bloody noses to the point that
my mother wanted to take her to the
hospital because we
couldn't understand why she
was bleeding so much. She's a
little girl. And we're
looking at the option, are we going
to need to take her to have the bleeding
cauterized?
Because
in what, in
what
society should we leave
our Children to be this ill
that we don't know what to do?
And you know, there was the question
of what health I've observed,
I've observed neighbors and their
health has declined in recent
years. I know my health has
declined in the past four
years. Um,
recently I was diagnosed
with an illness that is commonly
cited to be caused by
chemicals that are endocrine
disruptors. And
I can really, really
attest to the fact that residents
in the Carlsbad area, it's
very common and to see diseases
like this where you see
diseases that were caused by endocrine
disruptors, thyroid conditions.
There's just lots of different things.
There's a lot of different moving
parts in this community.
And of course,
you know, I I'm no public health expert,
but what I'm here to tell you today
is my lived experience. What
I see what I feel.
And you know, when we're talking
about setbacks, something I
want to speak
to very plainly is
that I am the child, the
daughter of a man who worked
in oil and his entire
life. So I
understand the
necessity of this. And I
understand that our economy relies
on it. And I have that
personal experience in
my home, how I was
raised. But
I also have the personal
experience of someone
who lives with six natural
gas pipelines.
And we recently received
a phone call last week letting us know
that they would like to add 1/7
possibly an eighth and there
is no more room unless
they come closer to our home.
And I just, I'm
grateful to speak today. I'm very
thankful and that is all I have
to say. Thank you.
Thank >> you. Thank you, Mr
>> Chairman representing
Petigru.
We're gonna, I got
four >> people on the list. So
let's try to get through the questions as
quick as we can. >> Thank you,
chairman. I will be
short.
Actually, I am short.
So that
worked,
you know, I will, I will
uh I'll start with a
personal story
to give you context.
When I left college
at New Mexico State and
moved to Southern California.
I,
I worked as an engineer
but on the sides,
I played professional
rugby
in country, out of country.
And
uh
when I first started playing,
playing in Southern
California, a
coach came to me the
first night and he said, I thought you said
you were fit and
I said I am
and he said, where are you
from? And I told him I was
from, from
uh New Mexico. I went to
school in New Mexico state.
He goes. Oh, hell boy, it's gonna
take you six months to get used
to the, to the
toxins in the air before you're
any good to me.
Now, that's southern
California.
Um, we have
toxins everywhere. I
find it interesting
that when, as chairman,
as we talk about health
outcomes,
would venture to guess that over
75% of the people
in this room take some level of
prescription
medications
to give you the same health outcomes
that were in these
reports,
give you the same
concerns.
And so,
but yet those are approved
by the FF
fa not
fa um
I will say chairman,
I appreciate the
differences between the two
presentations.
I felt one a
very one sided
skewed.
I'm not saying that the data
cued, it didn't
show the averages,
the means and the
and how you
compare that across
the board. I do
appreciate your presentation where it
pulls all that together
and actually provides a
perspective to understand
where the true public health risks
are at.
And I'm thankful for
that. I am
concerned Mr
Mr Chair and I will
open the question to whoever
wants to answer it
if, if, if
this is the
main and actually,
I'm gonna preface this
with the change
from
vertical wells to
fracking
benzene output
has dropped
dramatically.
One of the main reasons why we
have an increase in,
in costs and
tires
with respect to that if this,
if oil and gas is
such the
issue,
why aren't we seeing
and why aren't we talking about
this? And why aren't we studying
this in Lee and
Sanan County?
And at what point in time, Mr
Chairman, will we
start looking
at
the
impact
of the wind from the
southeast
into New Mexico,
which is what's created
in New Mexico
and created in Texas
combined.
That's my only question. I'd love
to hear what any of y'all have
to say about
that
>> atmosphere. Scientists talk about
discuss.
Yeah.
>> Uh Thank you for
the uh remarks. Representative
Pedigo.
Um
uh I was asked to
give a to focus on
the um
uh measurements,
particular measurements. I was not
asked to talk
about health. I only
had two health slides in
there because um I
didn't know that there
was a health expert
coming uh at the
time um
when I put these together
and submitted them
um happy to
give you averages
um of any
um particular
pollutants that you're
uh that you're interested in.
Um Very good question with
respect to uh how much
of the ozone is formed
in
um
uh the Texas
side and is transported
here instead of uh
actually formed in the
atmosphere on the, on the New
Mexico side.
Um
We have not set up
an experiment to
uh do
this type of
analysis. Um
It's not part of the
particular scientific
project that uh we're
currently carrying out.
Um our colleagues from
UT who are also
funded by he I in this
larger
um
project uh did
carry out some mobile
measurements uh
uh in which
they did measure
ozone uh along
285
right. So there may be
some signs coming out
of that, that provides some
information as
to how much of the ozone
is formed on
um the
uh Texas side versus the
New Mexico side. But
unfortunately, I cannot
comment on this
because I, I'm not privy to
the information. The data was
only collected a month ago
um and is still pending
uh partial analysis
and uh interaction
between us and ut
exchanging uh these
data, which is part of the
project that we're
in uh in
general terms, I can
tell you that
um
the ozone forms
during the transport,
right? So you get the
emissions
and the chemistry
typically gets into gear
in the morning. So
something that's emitted in
the morning in Texas
is going to form some
ozone while that
air mass is traveling
and ending up here in
in the afternoon.
So there is definitely
going to be some amount of
ozone that is formed on the Texas
side and some amount of ozone
that's formed on the New
Mexico side, you cannot
separate that, right?
And it's gonna be uh
actually not
a simple task for a scientist
to determine
um how
much
is on formed.
On either side. A lot
of times we use
uh atmospheric modeling
for that uh
that is anchored
in, in measurements.
So um at
some point, I hope we
may receive funding to
carry out that more detailed
analysis. Did
that answer your
question?
>> A share?
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
So I've got uh several
reports here from the American
Lung Association. Going back to
2015. So
2015, 1617,
18,
top 25 cleanest
us cities for
year-round particulate
pollution, top
25 for all of those
years.
Farmington, New
Mexico. Number
one, Cheyenne
Wyoming, Casper Wyoming two
and three, Farmington,
New Mexico. Cleanest air in
America
with at the time, two
of the largest coal-fired power
plants on the planet
and 40,000 wells
cleanest air in
America.
Then through COVID,
they started putting it out with
DNC which means
data not collected.
And today in the 2023
report, Farmington isn't
even there just
gone. How can we
go from the cleanest air in America
to they don't collect
it and now they don't do anything
with it. They don't even say they didn't collect
it. Wow,
cleanest air in America. Farmington,
New Mexico, two giant coal
fired power plants. 40,000
wells
asthma.
According to the same reports,
Roosevelt County had twice
as much asthma as
San Juan County in San
Juan County
wasn't quite the lowest
in the in the state,
but
perie
some of the worst, the, the worst
place for ozone in New
Mexico is Las
Cruces. I don't
have any wells down
there.
I just, I, I'm,
I'm amazed, you know, because
obviously this is not
particularly a right wing
organization that's producing
this and it's not funded by the oil
and gas industry. It's the
American Lung
Association
today.
In the 2023
report.
Doanna County
ozone
F
AN F according to
them,
ozone.
San Juan
County
particulate matter
DNC.
San County,
DNC.
Eddie County
DNC.
So, if we're talking about counties
that, that we ought to be
measuring, if, if it's, if it's
poisoning us, they
don't even, they don't even collect the data
anymore on
those counties and
collected.
I find that very interesting.
I also find it interesting that if we're
going to set back
something,
how far do you have to set it
back for it to make an actual
difference? 100
yards, 100 miles,
1000 miles?
Because what we're doing right now with
almost everything is we're setting it back
to China.
Mm
China is the one that's producing all
of the, the, the
coal pollution.
China is the one that's producing all
the lithium and,
and, and the nasty pollution
from there. We're setting
it back to China but you know, it still
blows this way, still
makes it here, still has
an effect on the environment on
the, on the planet in general. And
we've set it all the way back to
China
when I was
a kid
in high school. I lived
in a neighborhood house,
house, well,
house, house.
Ok. It
was, it was right there.
Ok. Yes,
I ate and slept and lived
by it and walked by it. Rode my bike
by it. Ok.
And
am I affected by it? I
don't know,
don't think I'm
sick.
Neither of my brothers or
anybody else that I know of in that
neighborhood. But it was
interesting
that we could all live in that neighborhood and
none of us messed with the,
well,
it didn't have a fence around it like we do.
Now, we also have
wells right next to the
river
uh in San Juan
County and
yet San Juan uh
river.
It's one of the cleanest rivers in
America
until the federal government decided
to pour all of the toxins
from the Gold King mine in
it. Until then
it was cleanest, one of the cleanest rivers
in America.
Yeah.
40,000
wells.
I think the people in San Juan
County, the, the,
the uh the city
of Farmington, the, the county
commission they take
into consideration these things
and they, and they move things back
when it's
appropriate.
Do we need somebody from Santa
Fe that, that
won't even drive to Farmington,
which is most of
them to
set a rule. And for
Farmington,
cleanest air in
America
until they stopped measuring
it. Don't know what it
is today.
DNC.
I think that all of these, these
rules and mandates and one
size fits all are
troublesome. They're definitely
troublesome to
me
because one size doesn't fit
all. Thank you, Mr
Chair. You
>> Representative
Herrera.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Excuse
me,
this question
is,
excuse me, directed
to Dr mcmullin.
And I'm I'm just
curious, you had this 18
member commission
experts
from, from all sectors
and I, I really appreciate
that. Um but
I'm just curious
after, after
reading your report, I'm just
curious why you
settled when we know
that one size doesn't fit
all on a 2000
ft
setback.
There's a lot
of
>> Yeah. Yes.
Thank. Thank you,
chair >> um
>> Mr Chair
representative. I uh it's
a very good question. I'm
impressed you picked up on
that. Uh
It was one of those
situations
where when
we went into rule making. Can
you hear me? Ok.
OK.
So
when we went into rule making
the commission, the Oil and
Gas Commission was presented with a
variety of, of
data. And while
they acknowledged that there had
there was no existing
evidence that the
concentrations that were being
measured. And um
uh in fact, the
analysis I have
uh that we
had conducted in the
state, they conducted, we actually
have measurements and the state
measurements that they've been doing as close
as 350 ft from
wells in
communities. So
we do actually have data that are very,
very close because
the program that I led there,
uh we used a mobile
van and when people
were complaining about no
um about
smells, uh
about nosebleeds
about other concerns.
Uh For example, if,
if uh we
were operator was drilling
in an area that was going to be in close
proximity, we would take
that mobile van and we would park
it there and collect real time
data to understand.
So we have a lot of data
as close as like 350
ft. So why
did the commission decide
2000
to be honest with you? It's my
opinion that they didn't
really fully understand
those results of this
hypothetical modeling
study that we had
conducted at the state.
Uh or well, we
had funded a
contractor to do.
But they said, ok,
under hypothetical scenarios
that we ran, we ran a
variety of scenarios of
well pads that were operating in
our western slope
of the type of well pads that would operate
in the geography on the
front range, which are also very
different and found
different results
that they thought
in the fact
that there would be these
short term potential
exposures
under certain
circumstances
that could cause these short term
effects. Maybe we
say that it could be out to 2000
because that's where it showed that there were
some subsets of
chemicals doctor,
she had said they don't all, you know, not,
they're not all created equal.
But the important
piece of that is that
they said we understand
acknowledge limitations and
uncertainty of those
data. So
we're also going to provide
in the regulations an
opportunity for individual
operators
to petition to the
commission during
permitting process
if they have other data
um uh
to demonstrate minim,
you know, minimizing
impacts to both human
health. But they're also these
operators are required to also do
cumulative impact assessments.
So they're not just looking at that, they're looking
at mitigating odors, they're looking at
mitigating environmental and ecological
impacts. They're
also working with that local government.
So it depends on what the the
negotiations are with the local
government.
So there was
a an, an understanding
that there could be these situations
with an understanding that
that was all uh
hypothetical information
we didn't have necessarily evidence
of, of harm
going on and that there
was an, there was an off
ramp, I guess
per se. Does that
help
>> you
were a member of this commission at
the time, a
staff member advising
the commission? >> That's
correct. So by
the time those rules
were being promulgated at
the commission that came out
of this bill
that passed in
2019,
the task force, the 19
member task force that
Governor Hickenlooper put together
was all before that
I was not a part of that task
force. Uh
II
I started working in the area
because that task force made a
set of recommendations. One
of those was that they were
going to that, they recommended
funding the
development of a new program
at the State Environmental
and Health Department.
And that program
was just focused on
understanding the science around oil
and gas and working with
regulators to inform,
to generate the science, to inform
policy. That's where I
came in. So does
that help make
sense? >> I'm
just curious why this
task force would recommend
legislation calling
for 2000 square
feet. I
mean,
I I realized there was an
off ramp, but what you're
saying is a collected
group of people
from all walks, you know,
all
all
>> stakeholders, >> all stakeholders,
thank you came up with this
recommendation that was passed
by a bill in the in
the Colorado State legl.
And they took that recommendation
based on this task force
who had to work for how many years?
>> Oh, I don't know how long that was.
I mean, they, they
put that together pretty quick.
Let me clarify. The task
force. Never made a
recommendation of a setback
ever. So
their recommendations were a
variety of recommendations
around enforcement
and other pieces that have nothing
to, not necessarily had to do
with public health and
because it's a complex issue,
right? So the
task force made a recommendation
to develop and fund a
program to investigate
the science.
We were collecting the
science and
then
legislative,
uh, so, and
then legislative session
happened in 2019
when there was a bill
that was suddenly,
um, uh,
generated,
that had nothing to do
necessarily with what we
were doing. So
the bill came in in
2019,
uh, and that ended
up being passed, which
then kind of changed the
entire conversation because
now when we were at the
State Health Department and the Oil and
Gas Commission,
we had to,
you know, uh, go
through rulemaking processes,
uh, based on what was
mandated within that bill,
that bill hadn't, was not
necessarily a part of what the task
force had done.
And to be more clear
Hickenlooper in, in
about, I believe, 2014,
2015, I was before I
came, but there was a bill that
showed up like today,
what you guys have that
was killed because we
felt like this was not
going to go well for our state.
And that's when Hickenlooper decided
we need to figure out how to deal with
this by putting together
all the stakeholders and this
shouldn't be coming through
a bill at the state level. It
needed to be dealt with
on understanding the science
and all the other pieces. Does that
help? So he decided
through executive order for
>> one second, we're gonna have to shorten our
our answers right and shorten our
questions, lunch
is here. So
why didn't people start getting up
one by one and grab your lunch and we'll
come back in, we'll keep going because
the list keeps growing like Santa's
bad list.
>> Did that answer it
and you can.
Thank you Mr Chair. I appreciate the
time.
>> Represent Garcia.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I just want to
make a comment, you
know, I can I
come from Grass New Mexico,
which was the renamed capital of the
world.
The premium basin
basically
the oil capital of the world right
now. And what
we did in, in Grants, we
fought it and fought it.
We got rid of uranium.
Now. Grants has nothing.
And what we're doing
here in this committee
and all you people here,
we're fighting oil and fighting
oil until it goes
away. And then we're gonna
be saying, how do we fund our schools?
How do we fund our roads? You
know, that's just a comment, Mr
Chairman because you know, we gotta keep that
in mind the direction
we're going with. All this is
oil is bad. Now
uranium was good
until there was no use for it. Then
it turned bad. Now oil
is going, we're doing the same thing to
oil and it concerns
me on what we're doing that we're
gonna, we're trying to kill
the thing that feeds the
whole city of New Mexico
and you know, we're too blind to
see in front of our face.
You know, we're biting the hand that
feeds us and we're gonna keep it up
until it goes away. That's just a comment
of mine. Thank you, Mr Chairman.
>> Thank you, Representative
Brown.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
I just really have some
observations and very
short summary of, of
that
one is I I think we all
want to
live healthy. There's no,
no debate about that.
Um But what I see
here is a
true lack of
science
regarding say
Carlsbad's
local
and other parts of the state, they're all
different.
Um,
what might be considered a harmful
concentration here is not
anywhere else. So to even
think about doing this, Mr
Chairman as a statewide
rule, doesn't make any sense to
me. If there's going to be
any kind of action taken,
it needs to be per
local.
And I look at the list of,
uh, we were given a list here of,
um, counties and
municipalities in the state that
already have setbacks.
I don't think we want to presume
that those are inadequate.
They were set by the
localities based
on public comment
and input. And
so um let's be very
careful not to
destroy
the uh industry that really
pays for most of what happens
in New Mexico.
And Mr Chairman, I I
question first of all, whether
these setbacks are even necessary
based on the,
the true good analysis
of the data.
And we have to remember
we're the legislative finance
committee and we have a duty
to make sure that this
state has
the resources, um
the revenue that it needs
to prosper
and something like this, if it's
done
inappropriately
and unwisely could
very much negatively
affect our state,
we're already a poor state.
And if we do something like this that
really kills industry
or cause it causes it to
withdraw, um
We are going to be far
more destitute than we
are currently as a poor state.
So we need to be very, very
careful in how
we proceed on this. Thank
you >> thinking. I
just one comment. We're not a poor
state. We're a rich state.
Thanks to oil and gas.
Senator
Woods
>> very quickly. Chair. I
know we're running out of
time. I
just want to
make sure I heard what I
heard
present
scientific
data does
not indicate
that any setback
would influence public
health. Is that
what I'm hearing from
the data sets we have
today?
And I know it would depend
on
where
I mean each,
each particular
area would have maybe a
different dataset.
But the data that
was gathered that we
saw today
in Loving
does not indicate a
setback would
influence public health.
Is is that what I heard,
Mr
Chairman,
>> Mr Chairman
Representative,
if you were only to look
at the data
today that was
presented, which
would be quite
limited, I mean, I
just showed an example and
also
believe um
doctor she would probably,
you know, agree with me on that.
It's not sufficient
enough to say that there would be
substantial evidence about a
specific setback
distance.
Uh particularly
here, you have
to look at collectively all of
the information.
>> But and with that
thought,
if we were having a
high incidence
of leukemia
in an area that
we say a
direct relationship
that bends in or whatever
Mr Chair,
that would probably
be AAA indicator
that
something in that area
is environmentally
causing something.
Have we got an area
in New Mexico that,
that leukemia is,
is very
high.
>> So
I don't want to
speak directly to that.
I would say that that
would be a perfect question for
your state Public Health
Department and the data are
publicly available looking at
that. So they are
surveilling and not just
leukemia but a
variety of things like
birth outcomes
of respiratory
effects, all of that type
of data.
It's one piece of
information.
So we look at what we measure
in the air so that
we could make risk management
decisions before
you get leukemia. That's
the intent. And then you're
also kind of looking at those
lagging measures.
Like, are we seeing
rates of health outcomes
that we're concerned about changing and
what could it be? Because
our health depends on a variety
of factors. One of those being
chemical exposures.
So yes,
that is a critical piece
of information to be
following, not
the only but very critical
as part of it.
>> In, in my
last,
I don't know if you're old enough to
remember Mr Chair, but
a few years ago, we was
very
upset about
the ozone layer in the
stratosphere
that it was
depleting.
And now we're upset
because we're
making
ozone.
Is it just the fact that it's
not getting to the
stratosphere?
Never mind off
subject. Thank you,
Mr.
>> This is why myself
and probably doctor shade love these
areas because we do
intermix between
high up in the atmosphere and
way down low. You know, on
boots on the ground. It's
interesting but complicated
science.
>> He did raise his eyebrows.
Represented small.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair. Um,
uh I have a few
questions, uh, including
from a member who was not able to
make it or a couple of points
uh, in data points to
raise uh some
additional questions on my end.
First Mr Chair, uh,
it was sent to
a, by a member.
There's an American Lung
Association
2022 2024
report. Excuse me?
Uh, that does
list, um,
uh, f,
uh, uh, report
card grades. Uh,
not for that,
including here for,
uh, Eddie County.
It includes Doanna County.
Certainly the county that I come
from, um,
in the information
that I was sent, it's ad
in Lee County and F in
San Juan
and AD in
Sandoval for sort of
reference.
Um,
and I, I'll make sure
that that information is publicly
available.
Um
That goes to one point Mr
chair, which is, you know, I'm
very familiar in Doanna County.
We have uh the
Manufacturing Center for
Northern Mexico in
Juarez. Very
important, great deal of
cross-border trade, a
great deal of air quality
impacts.
Um
If I think
we've heard
from this panel
that the study
of sort of origination
of pollutants in this case,
primarily in so
in Texas,
perhaps some in
Mexico, that's
not in any of the data that
we're hearing today,
Mr Chair. I think
as other members have brought up,
it is very important,
particularly
because
the, you know, two
thirds of the production
and of the
um uh
industrial
activity is
happening
in relative proximity.
I mean, not fully two thirds but
a large amount, a larger
amount of production
and industrial activity
is happening with our neighbors
in Texans, even
as we have
rapid increases in
production and industrial
activity here.
Um
The uh
I guess a brief
question for Doctor
Shaw, uh the
transportation.
So sources of knock,
we've seen obviously
very large increases
in truck traffic
for various
purposes
is there was that part of
your consideration
for sort of
some of the source? And
is there a way to
in the current study,
will you be able to tell
us with
any sort of confidence,
what share
of the
source that that is, or
is that something where we need to
ask that question
and look for that information
elsewhere?
>> Uh Thank you for that
question. Representative
Small. Um
Yes uh
at this stage
into our project, uh
when after we
have collected about one year of
data, we are starting to have
a closer look. And yes,
we are
planning to
do an analysis that
will give us at least a semi
quantitative answer
as to how much
um traffic
on the road is contributing
to the nox
emissions uh in the
area. Uh There's
no doubt that
uh truck traffic is contributing
in general to noc
emissions. Uh
The question becomes,
is it the
dominant source or
is potentially
uh stationary
diesel engines a
larger source or
a flair is a larger
source in
other um
share production areas?
It's been found that the
truck traffic tends to
dominate uh
the nitrogen oxide
emissions and
it together with
stationary
diesel powered uh
compressors
uh tends to make up
um around I think
80 to 90% if I
remember correctly of, of
the nox emissions
um
from the industry,
right? So that's not
89% of the total
that's from, from the industry,
right? And on top of that,
um other Knox contributors
are the, the general
uh traffic he would have had
in the area, even if there were
no uh
oil and gas exploration.
That, >> that, that's very
helpful. It's
encouraging that that is
part of what the next,
what, what you are is sort
of is included in the study
um following up.
And perhaps uh Austin, we
can ask with you as you follow up with
the presenters to share
with us a time frame
where we might look to expect
some more of that data.
Um
This is not
really a question for the
panelists, albeit
perhaps Dr sc it
will be part of, of some
of your remit.
It encompasses
primarily our
uh two agencies,
am Nerd Energy Minerals
and Natural Resources. And
New Mexico Environment Department,
New Mexico is
promulgated and
is supposed to be
enforcing or moving
towards enforcement
of the strongest
of their kind
methane reduction
uh regulations
in the country. These
were done relatively
recently with broad
stakeholder collaboration.
Um They've survived
different tests.
Mr Chair, you brought it up
in the last presentation
and I find myself
sharing a similar
sentiment. It
is vital that M
Nerd and NMED
participate in
future.
Um Parts
of this hearing,
I know we know
that we've increased their funding
substantially.
I remain, I think many of us
remain very committed to
seeing that continue,
but they must
participate and we must
be able to ask these questions.
Director sali just for
context, shared
air monitoring sites
of which there are relatively
very few
at least NMED that are
publicly available in
this part of New Mexico.
There are a multitude
in the area
where I come from in Donan
County, perhaps sort of
legacy. So
that's just a sort of
a flag, I guess.
Um
as it relates to the
traffic Mr
Chair, it
stands to reason.
I'll ask it as
we electrify or
reduce emissions through
zero and low emissions
vehicles. Be that again,
electrification,
hydrogen or
other uh
transportation
modes
that will significantly
reduce the vehicular
emissions,
correct?
>> Yes, trucks on the road are
typically um
the dominant source of
knock uh nowadays
uh because of the high temperature of
the diesel engine and not
all uh
diesel trucks yet
are equipped
with the Knox
reduction technology.
Um So that would
actually be a short term
measure
that might be much more
um impactful
to make sure that
the trucks that are in use
actually have
selective catalytic
reduction cr
technology
installed,
which is
dramatically reducing nox
emissions from these large
diesel engines. I'm not
privy to whether
any of the compressor
engines used in industry
actually have AC R
technology.
>> That, that's great. Thank you, Doctor
Shut. Thank you Mr Chair.
And I think I
really appreciate
that insight as it relates to the
transportation on
the industrial side,
we are embarking
and robustly moving
on a number of
different ways to reduce
those sources of emission
and industry working
collaboratively with
a number of different
stakeholders.
We need the agencies
and others here with
a new Mexico centric
uh perspective
and up to date knowledge
about application
and enforcement to sort
of have a as
close to real time
understanding of how these
rules. Mr Chair. I also
want to note there are new federal
rules that are going into
effect. Um
So perhaps this
may, may end up being
Doctor Shadd sort of a
baseline and
your study helps
us go from where we
have been
and to mo to very clearly
understand sort
of real time what's
going on now?
Is that, is that, what are your
hopes? I guess I would ask.
>> Uh, yes, thank you.
Um, I, I see it very
similarly. Um, I'd
like to make a quick
comment to,
um, one thing
that was brought up by
Senator Scher,
um, which you
partially addressed, but
that had to do with particular
matter. Um,
no, I wanted to
note that, uh, the industry
is not considered
a large emitter
of particular matter.
Um, with
two exceptions,
one is dust,
uh, that comes
natural to this type of
area, right? Uh, road
dust that gets kicked up
by, by big trucks, especially
when there's no pavement. Uh
The other one is soot.
We do measure soot at
our site. None of this
data is included in the materials
that I I presented.
Um,
but the,
uh, the suit is not
at levels that would
concern us. But
we have been asked to add
the so measurements at a later
stage into our
project because
it is a no of of
the strong health effects that are
associated
with particular matter
particularly. So,
so that is
also part of our
measurements. >> Thank
you. Thank you, Mr
Chair. Thank you, Doctor Shai. I look
forward to that uh
briefly uh
Doctor mcmullen.
Um I
find myself confused,
frankly frustrated with the
testimony. I
find the example of
Colorado to
be
uh
you, you the
the experience was there yet
you seemingly disavow
in different
ways, entirety
of that experience
separate from that Mr
Chair. Uh
We are entirely different
from Colorado
in many
different ways, not least
of which is level of
production and the
importance of that production
in various ways
nationally as a
state and internationally.
Finally, Mr Chair,
I think as we
push forward, I'm
really left. I, I think
there is perhaps more
confusion
that was um
seemingly
presented
in your remarks than
exists
as we look at this
from a broad stakeholder
perspective, not
to say or to minimize
the differences and the challenges
that there are. But
Mr Chair as
a state, even as we've
increased production, we
have gone through the methane
rule and
other collaborative
steps to reduce
emissions, which is a
fundamental
goal that we
have to pursue. And
it, if we reduce
emissions effectively,
we are serving
the citizens of our state,
particularly in this
region and doing
many other good things. If we're not
able to do that, then we
are falling
short of the goal.
And I just have
to sort of say for the
record
that
the
sense of confusion
that I was left with and if
I was left with that inappropriately,
I apologize,
that sense of confusion
is entirely
unhelpful to
moving a collaborative
process forward.
And um
on the other hand, Mr
Chair, I know
that there are a wide
diversity of stakeholders
in here who
have a very strong
track record of working
collaboratively and
I actually have a great deal of
confidence that we'll continue
to make progress here.
Just conclude with that.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you, you know, to our
presenters. Thank you guys. I
mean, you have to have balance and
presentation, right? You can't
have all the left and all
the right in order to
make a smart determination as a
businessman, right? Give me your best
thoughts. Give me the best data.
Tell me how to move forward. Tell
me how not to put New
Mexico in a
position or
we have to start making
cuts
each well, is a little different.
Senator Sheerer knows this. I have
property on the animus. Right.
With a wellhead
probably 50 ft from the river
bank. So when it floods,
it takes that wellhead
with it, I have another property
with setbacks
of 200 ft in the middle of
an alfalfa field
about 1000 yards
from the river. Right.
So, what happens? I mean, we,
we monitored, they monitor
and, and one, it has
a pump that
runs all the time.
So um
the environment department hasn't
really tested this area.
We don't see any marks on the environment
department's map where they're testing
air quality in here at
all. Maybe they are,
maybe they're not update on the website,
but they're not showing them, they're showing Las
Cruces in
Albuquerque and Sandoval.
But there's no air quality testing
down here that we see. So
you have to make good determinations with
the data, right?
I'm not an expert on the data. You're
way above, above
my level in and how we do
this. But I mean, we have
to start somewhere
and every, well, just like you said
is just like your kids on
your finger, every
finger is different, right? So
everyone is gonna admit something a
little bit different
in, in what happens. And so we
have to look at that and see how we're gonna
treat them with setbacks.
Then we listen to the young lady that grew
up around a Wellhead and,
and in her whole
life and you know, those
are true stories in life,
right? The smell
is there. If you grow up in a dairy, the
smell is there, right?
Same thing, methane
gasses, same
thing you grow up
around dairies that
happens around
wellheads that happens, you go around
other livestock or other environments
and their smells and, and
contaminants that happen
naturally in, in that.
Uh So I thank you for your
presentation.
Uh I appreciate it.
I thought it was a good
place to start as we move
forward and, and talk about
setbacks and what if they
really do need to happen?
Uh What are
the environmental effects? It
sounds to me like another
year or two years worth of study
with a lot more data
on specifics and
different
lower carbons and
everything soot and,
and everything so we can make
a good determination what
really is happening
right to people that live
next to all sites or close
proximity here, what's happening to
the environment. But
it kind of saddens me that we
don't have the environment department
here. We
requested them in our package.
You'll see emails from
the environment department and
EMD uh
some people were going on vacation,
which is understandable at certain
points. Uh And
EMD had another conference.
So uh we do
need those agencies
here. We've
raised their level of funding
quite a bit over the last couple of
years and, and it's time for
them to all pull together and go to
work. They know our
LFC schedule came out when
in May, oh,
earlier when we first
met.
So it came out earlier than
that. They're well aware of,
of our agendas and,
and that they could be
there if they don't want to
come. This is
the only committee that has subpoena
power.
If we need to get to the truth
and really need to resolve
some issues, we'll get
there. So
I appreciate your time and, and
thank you, Austin. Thank
you
real quickly.
Everybody will just stop for one minute. I
everybody knows Bill Valdez,
those of us that have been around a
while he passed
away. So I guess we
could, we just rise
for a moment of silence for
him real
quick.
Thank you guys.
I think Bill worked for
House Appropriations. I don't know how many
years Representative Small you
want to give some details. >> Yeah.
Thank. Thank you so much Mr Chair.
Thank you for that recognition, Mr
Chair uh Bill
Mr Valdez served
with House Appropriations
for over 30 years.
As we know he had a
distinguished career with the
state Mr Chair. He
served uh various
chairs from various
parties. He worked
with all of us, whether chair
member or
um you know, somebody
who had a question,
did it with the utmost
professional Mr chair.
Uh Even when he
was fighting his
health battle,
he put the
service to the state
and the work for the committee
at the very top of his priority
list. Even as Mr Chair,
he served, I think as the
announcer for
basketball games for
several decades,
uh an incredible
pillar in the community
with his wife Adriana.
And we thank
you very much for the moment of
silence. And I know all
of us from the house and the
Senate send
his family our
love and best wishes
and share our gratitude for
Mr Valdez for Bill's
service. >> Thank
you. Thank you. I guess,
uh let's take about five
minutes real quick while you guys grab
lunch and then we'll sit back down
and jump right
back in and try to play catch up.
They can shorten this presentation
just a little bit so we can
get to where we need to be back
on the
clock >> that.
