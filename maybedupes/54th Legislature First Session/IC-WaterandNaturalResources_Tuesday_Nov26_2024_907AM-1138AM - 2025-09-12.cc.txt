ask questions, uh, expressed
concerns, make recommendations,
just sort of like a uh test run
uh for the Bills before we get
to the session.
Uh, we will not be doing
committee endorsements.
We're just gonna do a Q and A on
the bills.
Um, and we're gonna stick to the
uh schedule.
So, um, it's, you know, I'll,
I'll take a list in terms of
people who want to ask
questions.
Um
If there are people on the list
and we're at the end of the
time, we're just gonna move on.
Uh, I'm not gonna try to get to
everyone on the list, um,
because, you know, you know how
bills go in the session, you
could
spend 3 hours on the bill.
And we, we don't have that
luxury today.
Uh, so we're just gonna keep to
the schedule and keep kind of
clicking through. If you're on
the list and don't get a chance
to ask your questions or make
your comments.
Um,
I would simply encourage you to
approach the sponsor offline and
do it that way.
Uh, and also we put our for,
we're figuring out how to fit
the
Agenda together, we put our
public comment yesterday.
Uh, so we won't have public
comment today. Um, we will, of
course, um, when the session
starts, they'll be an
opportunity to make public
comment then.
Uh, any questions or anything
from the committee before we
start?
OK, so our first bill today, uh,
or PS, uh, product restrictions.
Uh, representative Ferrari.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you committee.
Um, our, uh, this bill.
Um, is, uh, relating to the
environment enacting the per and
polyfloacy.
Um, products or POS, uh,
restrictions Act, and it it's
prohibiting certain products
that contain an intentionally
added per or polyfloor ayl
substance and requiring
disclosure of information and
testing of products sold.
And offered for sale or
distributed, um, for sale in
this state that contained an
intentionally added um or
polyfluraacy substance and
providing penalties, making an
appropriation.
The reason this is so important
is that POS, which is an easier
way to say.
Her and Polly, Flora Acolo,
a kill,
um, substances, um, is because,
uh, they've been used in
industry and consumer products
since the 1940s and because of
their useful products,
properties, I'm sorry. There are
thousands of different PAs, some
of which have been more widely
used and studied than others and
the perfluraoinon
tonic, sorry.
I've got to practice this acid
and uh the uh sulfonate phos,
for example, are two of the most
widely used in studied chemicals
in the POS group.
And um they've been replaced in
the United States with other
PFOS in recent years, and one of
the common characteristics of
concern is that many break down
very slowly and can build up in
people, animals, and the
environment over time, and
that's why they called them
forever.
Chemicals and they can be found
in lots of different things in
our water, soil, air, and food
as well as in materials found in
our homes or workplaces,
including drinking water.
Soil and water at or near water
sites, fire extinguishing foams
such as we've heard the
contamination in Clovis area,
manufacturing or chemical uh
production facilities that
produce or use POs and food,
food packaging, household
products and dust, personal care
products and biosolids.
So with
There's a lot of information
that um I hope you'll get a
chance to read through this EPA,
um, uh, report, I've been
reading lots of reports and um
what we need to do for New
Mexicans is to add protections
from this as much as possible,
um, and with that, um, I will
have uh Mr. uh Kriska, um.
Explain uh the bill.
By the by different sections to
make it easier to break it down.
Good morning, Mr. Chair, members
of the committee, uh Tom
Kirschka, Legislative council
Service, uh, so I'm here just to
provide technical assistance.
I'm not here to support or
oppose this bill.
So I'm just gonna go through um
the bill.
And just briefly explain what it
does.
So, the second section has a
definitions, uh, many of the
products that are set to be
restricted, um, or defined in
that section. Um it also defines
intentionally added, uh, which
is kind of what it sounds like,
um, that's uh POs is
deliberately added during a
manufacturing process.
Uh, section 3 has a reporting
requirements.
Uh, so a manufacturer has to
report to the Environment
departments on um how much PFOS
is in the product.
Um, what the product is going to
be used for.
And it also creates um a
prohibition, so after 2028, if
there is a manufacturer who is
not submitted this information
to the Environment Department
and the Environment Department
hasn't approved it, um, they've
been in violation of this act.
Uh, for, for selling or
distributing a product.
Uh, Section 4 is the main uh
prohibition section. It has two
prohibitions. The first one
begins in 2027, and that's the
list of consumer products you
see, um, including firefighting
foam and some other products.
Um, and the other prohibition in
that section that begins in
2034.
Um, and that's for any products
that contains intentionally
added POS.
Um, except if the environment
department by rule has
designated that that product is
an unavoidable use.
So an unavoidable use means um
That the product is essential
for health, safety, or the
functioning of society and for
which alternatives are not
reasonably available.
Um, there's also um a consulting
section in there, so the
environment department would
consult with the Department of
Ag.
Um, for a product that's going
to be used in agriculture, uh,
to make sure that that should be
designated as unavoidable use.
And it also exempts uh the
resale of used products and it
exempts uh medical devices.
Section 5,
requires uh testing of a product
when the environment department
suspects that that product
contains uh intentionally added
PFOS.
Um, and again, you know, medical
devices and drugs are exempt
from this.
Section 6.
Um, is, uh
Authorizing the environment
department to make some rules.
Um, so they can make rules on
the reporting of PFOS and to
identify the currently
unavoidable uses.
Section 7 is penalty.
Um, this is going to be enforced
by the Attorney General.
And section 8 provides an
appropriation to the Environment
department to carry out this uh
this bill.
With that I
Be available for any questions.
And um, the bills have been
handed out to the committee.
They've also been posted on the
website.
So if you're watching online or
in the audience, uh, you can,
you can get a copy of the bill
on the legislative website and
then legis.gov under our
committee.
Um
Members of the committee.
Mister Chair. Um, I'd also.
I'd also like to um introduce
from NMED, um, to reps who are
here just to answer any
questions that might be beyond
our scope.
Um, Mr. Ogos and Mr.
Cayman Street.
here. I'm sorry, Greg.
Totally got it wrong.
OK. Thank you for that.
Um
OK, so I'm seeing a few members.
I had a couple questions, um.
I, I don't understand the dates,
so section 3, the information.
is basically 2028 and Section 4
is
2027.
So, it looks to me like
The prohibition on sale kicks in
before the information required.
In section 3.
Uh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee.
Yeah, I mean the list of
products.
Um, those are banned.
Um
So they don't necessarily need
the information before those
that band goes into effect.
OK, so.
So they don't, OK.
In the, um,
Could you explain again which
projects are not?
And what, what's it take to in
or what's it take to be able to
continue to sell a product that
contains people.
Uh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee. So yeah, section 4
has the list of those products.
So those products
are set to be banned beginning
2027.
So
The products are not going to be
banned are either products
through which um the environment
department has found it's an
unavoidable use.
Or it's um products that are
exempt.
So this is um
Products for which federal law
governs the presence of PFOS.
It's the sale and resale of a
used product, and it's a medical
device or drug.
It's regulated by the US FDA.
OK. And I understand PFOS is
used in some clothing, is that
fabric treatments, I, I don't
know if it's
applied to the clothing or if
it's part of the manufacturing
process of the bread.
Or material.
Uh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, um, so this, uh,
fabric treatment is defined.
Um, and it's, it's defined as a
substance applied for to fabric
for stained grease or water
resistance or flame retardants.
Um, so I
It could be, um,
It could be clothing.
Right, and I guess my question
is,
Do they
To the make the clothing and
then apply a layer or if you
have a, a, a article of clothing
that's
polyester or something else
that's synthetic.
If they
If the PIAS is integral to the
material used to make the
clothing, and it's not a
treatment, does it still apply?
If it's deliberately added, but
if it's a product that they
can't separate it, I would think
that it would.
Um, this is not a legal.
Definition, we would have to um.
Can we?
To our NMED if they have a
special um
Understanding of that.
Although there are a lot of
products like Patagonia and
others who are um making sure
that they do not include PFOS in
their.
Uh
Materials.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Uh, could
you repeat the question, please?
Um
Yeah, so
I'm looking at, for example,
fabric treatments, uh, on page
8, item 6. You also see carpets
and rugs on one.
Like, are we talking about
strictly something that is
applied to a product.
Or if it's part of the product.
Is that
Different. I, I think those are
two different things. And, and
that's a great question.
Certainly, I think in this
instance we're uh referring to
something that's applied to the,
the fabric that's, uh, you know,
very common use of these types
of materials, um, you know, um,
furniture, uh, protector is
another type of example of a uh
fabric treatment. Uh, that's how
we see a lot of them, but it, it
is a good question because it
does raise, you know, whether or
not PIA is included in
Some types of fabrics. Uh, I
actually don't know the answer
to that question, but I think
that is something uh we want to
look a little more into. OK. And
my last question is, there's,
there's been um
Some discussion in the news
about uh POs and fracking
fluids.
Is your bill not address that?
Um, Mr. Chair, uh, no, this is
not considering the
Um
Oil and gas, except it might for
some of the manufacturing.
And uses outside of uh
production.
OK. Is that right? And I, I'm
sorry, sir, could you
Can you introduce yourself, I
forgot to ask you apologies.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. My name is
Zacharyogas. I'm the general
counsel at the New Mexico
Environment Department. OK,
great.
Um
Uh, Senator Stephanic you have a
question. Um, thank you, Mr.
Chair. Is this an agency bill?
Representative Mr. Chair, um,
Senator, no, it is not, but we
are working with NMED, um.
To make sure that their
interests are also included.
Um, so, Mr. Chair,
representative Ferrari do does
that mean they'll be there to
support the bill?
Um, at this point I.
Don't know that we can say that.
OK. Thank you very much, Mr.
Chair.
Thank you, uh, Representative
Lujan.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um,
I'm just going over some of the
The nuances of of the the new
language on page 5, line 18.
So, um, and
To a brief description of the
product, um, including a
universal product code
stockkeeping unit or other
numeric code assigned to the
product. Is that
Is that what is just standard to
say brief, I mean, do we want
more information or does, I
mean, is this sufficient for the
purpose of like really
regulating this substance.
Mr.
Um, Mr. Chair and
Representative, um, this bill is
modeled after um what Minnesota
has and um other states are also
working closely with the same.
Model.
Um,
And then uh section 6 on page
11, uh, line 14, identify
currently unavoidable uses, um.
So the, Mr. Chair, um,
The intent of the of the bill is
to limit the the uses of POS. Is
that correct?
And
What, uh, what I guess, um,
currently, what are unavoidable
uses that would be acceptable.
Do we know any of those, Mr.
Chair?
Um, Mr. Chair and
Representative, yes, medical
supplies that um needed also
there's some medications, um.
And, and cancer treatment, um,
that.
Require
The use of some of these,
um, great, and I also, I mean, I
know there's industrial uses as
well, uh, for instance, the
manufacturing of
Um, computer products and and
chips and and things like that.
Would that be, um, would they be
able to, um.
Register under this uh uh
provision for unavoidable uses,
Mr. Chair.
Uh, yes, they, they would be.
Considered.
Alright, and then on the last
page, page 12, um, line two,
when you go into the penalties
collected pursuant to this
section shall be deposited in
the current school fund. What
school fund specifically, Mr.
Chair, are you referring to?
Uh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, yeah, that's just a
standard language. There's a
requirement that these types of
fees go into the current school
fund.
OK. Um, does that need to, uh,
Just for the sake of the
conversation, uh.
We have different school funds,
if I'm not mistaken, do we need
to identify the the specific
school funds we're going to, uh,
put these, these monies into
you, Mr. Chair.
Uh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, um,
I'm not sure. I think that is
the name of the fund, the
current school fund, um,
That maybe that distributes to
other funds, I'm not sure. Yeah,
just a question there and then
the last question Mr. Cha have,
um, the appropriation, uh, the
$100,000 is that budgeted in
the.
Through the agency.
Mr. Chair,
Um, Mr. Chair and
Representative, no, it is not as
of yet because we haven't passed
the bill. It would have to be in
future budget.
OK. And we'd also have to make
sure that that's
Going to be enough.
OK, so,
The dates that
That are given in this 27, 2027,
2028, then.
We don't, so the, the $100,000
doesn't need to be budgeted for
this next fiscal year. Is that
what?
Mr. Chair, no. OK, thank you.
Thank you, uh, Senator Woods.
Uh, Mr. Chair, the only
question, I think, uh,
Representative Lulon asked the
question, when do you expect the
rules to be written?
When does your bill describe
when these rules will be
written.
I'm sorry, Mr.
Ta date um
uh representative as, as to
Um
On section 7.
You're talking about, well,
section 6, it talks about rules.
And what is the date for those
rules to be written.
When, when will those rules
Be written when, when can we
expect those rules to come out.
Uh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, um, there is not a
set date.
What it means is that
But in 2034, if there's not a
rule that this product is an
unavoidable use, then that
product is prohibited.
So they're gonna do a negative.
They're going to prove a
negative.
Uh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee.
Basically, yeah, the assumption
is that all products containing
intentionally added PFOS would
be prohibited, start beginning
2034, except if there's a rule
that it's an unavoidable use.
So, so again, represent to Luhan
said.
You won't need this $100,000 to
go to the environment
department.
Until sometime in the future.
When they determine they're
gonna need it.
So it will be determined when
they put it in the budget.
The agency.
Yeah, never mind. Thank you.
Mr. Chair, Senator Woods, yes,
we still have some things to
work out.
Senator Worth.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chair and
thank you for ringing the bell.
So I have a couple of questions
about the enforcement on page
12, the Attorney General is
basically
Given the right to enforce, it
looks like.
A civil action for appropriate
relief, including a restraining
order. I'm just curious, what's
the
What other appropriate relief
could this, could the Attorney
general bring an action for
damages.
Under this language.
Yeah, Mr. Chair, uh, senator
and, uh, just to make sure I
understand your question
correctly. You're asking whether
or not the attorney general
would be able to, um, you know,
file a claim for damages under
this. And, you know, under my
reading and
I've only had a, you know,
really preliminary reading of
it. Uh, my thought is that yes,
this would allow for, for
damages.
And Mr. Chair, the reason I ask
again, and I think
I would also consider adding a
private cause of action. We
heard about the
Situation with the dairy farms
in on the east side of the
state, right here in Santa Fe
County, we have in La Cieneca.
Homeowners who have basically
all their wells have been
contaminated by PFOS.
And I just think that
Banning this is all great.
But the consequences
To individuals,
When this, when we saw it 4000
cows, God knows what the health
consequences to the.
Humans that have been drinking
the water out there, likewise in
La Cienega.
And I get wanting to ban it, but
I also think there needs to be,
I mean, a $500 to $10,000
penalty seems pretty small if
you've contaminated someone's
well, uh, and so I just wanna
make sure that there really are
If we're going to say we're not
going to use these, these
products. Let's make darn sure
that there's enough teeth there
that folks
Don't make a business decision
and say, sure, I'll do it.
For this cost, because again,
what you worry about is kind of
super fun all over again. Come
in, use the product, then
they're gone, and how do you
figure out how to find someone
to address the issue, and of
course, once this is in the
water, I don't think you can
ever solve it. So that's the,
the tragedy of this product. So
I, I, this is a, this is a good
Discussion, I appreciate you
bringing this, and I just think
it's something as we think it
through. I just wanna make sure
there's enough.
teeth there, so people really
have a a remedy. Uh thank you,
Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Senator, uh,
Representative Herrera.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
And thank you, Representative
for bringing this bill forward.
I, I just want to know, um,
Uh, what is a class B.
Fire film. I mean, what is, what
is that? Will somebody tell me?
I, it was on page.
Uh, 3 at the top, firefighting
foam means a Class B
firefighting film.
Uh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, um, I don't have an
answer to that. I can get back
to you. I know there are
different classes of
firefighting foam.
Um, there's A, B, and C, but I,
I don't know the details.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I, I, uh, have you run this by
the firefighters union, or they?
In support of this, I'm just
curious.
I, I don't know what
firefighting foam Class B is,
but the people that use it, I, I
don't know if they've been asked
about it.
Um, Mr. Chair and Representative
of we have not spoken to them uh
as a group directly, but um they
have suffered many um medical
and health effects because of
using some of these, uh
especially the the firefighting
film, but we'll, we'll get that
information for you exactly.
I don't know.
Uh thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. I just, I, I guess.
This is modeled after uh a law
that has been implemented in
Minnesota, is what you're
saying. How, what is the
progress of that?
How is that working in
Minnesota?
I was working so.
Mr. Chair and Representative,
I'm not sure.
We can find out, but um it does
take time, you know, to see the
different products coming off
the market and to um see the
health effects, you know.
From less, you know, exposure to
people. It's going to take a
long time.
A representative and Mr. Chair,
we're all really worried about
this, so I I do appreciate this.
I, um,
Uh, and
And its impact on water in our
state um.
So I think we just need to learn
a lot more and uh see how it's
being implemented and uh I, you
know, I always like to follow
good practice, best practices,
so if somebody's figured this
out, well I'd sure like to see
that. Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Thank you, Representative
Representative Montoya.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Uh,
Representative, um,
So I was just going through the
document here and I'm
On, on the
3rd page.
The statement is exposure to
PFOS may be harmful to human
health.
I'm sure there's something more
than just that it may be.
Harmful
Um, I mean, the, the, the
purpose for this is there's
something that's happened in New
Mexico is there's something I, I
think you mentioned something
about cattle.
is there a
Is there a certain amount.
Of this that is dangerous and
then in lower levels, that it's
not dangerous.
I mean, if we're gonna say some
things are necessary products to
have it.
We're making a determination
there.
Um, so I, I'm trying to figure
out what
Or do we want to just eliminate
PFOS completely? Is it, is it
In smaller quantities, not
dangerous.
And, and for it to get into the
drinking water.
I mean, most landfills are not.
Really that close to to water.
So,
The, the, the number of products
to be put in a landfill.
That could deteriorate over
time.
I'm just trying to figure out
if, if, if what's the right
amount to regulate or to try and
get rid of because obviously
many of these products
You're not gonna be able to keep
from coming into the state if
people want the product, they'll
just go online and order it, and
it'll be delivered to them
directly to their house.
So we'd only be harming.
New Mexico businesses
potentially, so.
I, I'm just wondering, is there
a way to split the baby here
where
And, and, and once again, if you
could please go over what the
actual
health
Risk is, cause I, I'm not
finding it defined in this
document.
Um, Mr. Chair and um a
representative Montoya, it is
something that that will be
determined by enemy D, the
different levels that are
acceptable, and um for products
that are sold in our state, it
would include any that are
brought into the state.
So, um, it won't hurt just New
Mexico or it's not intended to
hurt, but for manufacturers to
find alternatives that don't
include the PFOS.
So
And the example.
Um, of what happened in Clovis
with the um firefighting foam
that went into the water system
that is and then also, you know,
things like the dry cleaners and
there's many examples in our
state where this will help to
avoid any future.
You know, contamination.
So thank you for that, and
Representative, then maybe I'm
Barking up the wrong tree here,
but why, why wouldn't we just go
after the
The products which we know are
likely to end up in our.
Water or wastewater or water. It
seems like that would be a
a, a limited, more targeted
Effort might be more widely
accepted. um.
Um, Mr. Chair and
Representative, um, yes, I'm
sure that enemy will, you know,
um.
Start out with the most obvious
and um but we, it's not just
into water, but it's also into
fabrics and food and things like
that that affect, um, especially
our children and um.
Even prenatal.
Thank you. Uh, so, Mr. Chair,
just one last thing, more of a
statement. It just seems uh
If it were in
To, to, to, to Senator Wor's
point about a private right of
action. I don't know that that
explicitly has to be in here. I
don't believe anybody.
Would not have a private right
of action if they feel like
they've been harmed and they can
prove it.
So
You know, it, it, I, I would
prefer to see a more limited
targeted where we know the
actual health risks, but
As I, I was reading through this
and it just, it
It doesn't seem like anything's
really clear. It's
Likely, but not proven yet.
So, thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative. Um, I
had one additional question, uh,
on the firefighting film in
particular, um, if the Feds
continue to use that kind of
firefighting foam.
Can we, if this pass, could we
enforce this against the federal
government.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and to, to
answer your question, it, it's a
uh that is the subject of, you
know, our ongoing litigation
that we have with the Department
of Defence out, especially out
in the eastern part of the
state, um, one of the key issues
in that case is whether uh RIRA
applies or, you know, the state
has the authority to enforce its
hazardous waste act laws against
the federal government and, you
know, why Rickro is important
there is because Rick.
a federal statute that contains
a waiver of sovereign immunity
that allows the state to
regulate federal facilities, um,
in, in that litigation, we're
arguing that we do have that
authority, um, you know, so if
this bill were to pass, we would
certainly, you know, take that
forward and, uh, you know, along
the same lines, you know,
enforced against the federal
government as well.
Represent Ferrera on that point.
Uh yeah, I just looked it up in
Class B firefighting foams are
typically used in uh in chemical
and petrochemical plants,
refineries, oil and gas storage
facilities, so it's a particular
kind of film, obviously used in
special situations where water
isn't gonna work, so I, I, I,
I'm just asking questions here,
trying to learn. Thank you.
OK. Um, ribs and furry, um, and
gentlemen, thank you for that
presentation. Uh, uh, you know,
I think that was useful. That
was sort of my hope, right?
It's like, people on this
committee who are gonna see
these bills come through the
session, get some preview of it
and, you know, we shared some
concerns and some questions for
the sponsor and it, I mean, it
sounds like you have
Or you can do and, and, you
know, when you come back in the
session, we'll follow up on this
conversation. So thank you very
much. Thank you, Mr. Chair and
committee.
OK.
So our next bill is uh power up
New Mexico. We're gonna hand
that out. Um,
with, um,
Hi
Representative whenever you're
ready.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me
just grab.
One email thread here.
Oh, you need it, find it later.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman,
members of the committee, thank
you very much for the
opportunity to present power up
New Mexico to you. Um, some of
you may have already heard of
Power Up. Uh, we've presented it
to a couple other committees and
for others of you, this is a
brand new concept. I want to
take a moment first, uh, Mr.
Chairman, to thank, uh, Mr.
Cricket, who's been fantastic in
helping us kind of finalize the
details of this bill. We've
worked really hard on it, um,
and so
To begin, I'd like to kind of
State the lay of the land for
everybody.
Um, what, what led to power up
New Mexico coming to be. So the
state of New Mexico has been
incredibly aggressive and great
in establishing um greenhouse
emissions reductions, uh, goals,
both in regulation and in
legislation over the few, the
last few years, I think it began
with uh efforts such as the
energy transition Act, um, and
so, uh, we just recently had
pass
of the clean car, clean truck
rule, and we are um
enthusiastically promulgating
policy to help us get to net
zero, however, Mr. Chairman,
members of the committee and
looking at the reality and the
particularities of how we get to
those goals. We happened upon a
very um problematic issue with
New Mexico's power grid.
Um, and it has become more and
more apparent that um if we are
to do things such as stand up
the statewide electric vehicle
fast charging infrastructure
grid, um, utilizing credible
funding through the National
Electric Vehicle Infrastructure
Act, which requires the
placement of uh level 2 or 3
fast uh DC chargers every 50
miles on all three interstates.
We need the power to do so.
And right now we don't have it.
Thus, the um impetus for power
up.
Um, Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee, we started working on
Power Up. Gosh, I don't know
about 6 or 9 months ago and
we've pulled together a group of
over 60 stakeholders throughout
the state, uh, to come together
and figure out how to solve this
problem, um, and it is come to,
uh, it is pulled together folks
from pretty much every side of
the aisle, um, every position at
every advocacy point, um, it's
first bill I've worked on where
we've had support from both the
environmental community and.
And, um, folks in the Permian
Basin because of the fact of the
matter is, uh, we all need power
and modernization and
energization of the Mexico's
power grid will benefit all New
Mexicans. So getting into the
bill, um, Mr. Chairman. Section
one,
Essentially requires all of our
um larger utilities, so the IOUs
is what we refer to them as to
um submit what we call
beneficial electrification
plans, uh, to the PRC for
consideration. So, um, a
beneficial electrification plan
is basically how do we reduce
Energy that comes from fossil
fuel resources and replace it
with cleaner, more uh renewable
and efficient electric
technology. So these beneficial
electric electrification plans
or BEPs, I'll be now referring
to them as, um, have to do
several things, um, which will
be evaluated by the PRC. One,
target. Right?
Sorry, I was on the wrong page,
um, the beneficial electric
electrification plans have to be
filed by June 1st, um, of 2026
and that they support voluntary
customer adoption of beneficial
electrification measures and
beneficial electric
electrification targets that
will be set also by the PRC for
2032.
Um,
The targets, the beneficial
electrification targets will be
adopted every 6 years
thereafter, and um they have to
comply with other greenhouse gas
emission reductions or air
quality targets that are adopted
by the state, um, thus ETA and
and others. Um, the beneficial
electrification should be
offered to all markets,
including residential,
commercial, and our agriculture.
Markets, um, and the PRC through
requiring the filing of these
reports must ensure several
things are achieved through our
BEPS One max to maximize
customer benefits at the lowest
reasonable cost to those
customers to, um, every customer
has to have the opportunity to
participate in these programs.
3, the incentives given through
the program must complement all
other incentives, including
those federal incentives that
are available for beneficial
electrification.
And uh it has to maximize
greenhouse gas production.
Um,
BAPs must also target low income
households, um, our project
reductions in greenhouse gasses,
um, that we already know are
happening and then, then they
can uh increase and augment
those uh those efforts, um, the
programs and rates established
through the IOUs will improve
their electrical or should
improve their electrical system
efficiency.
And um budgets targeted
installations and projected fuel
savings must also be articulated
in that plan. Um, lastly, there
is a requirement incorporation
of stakeholder feedback,
although um might be
non-binding, um, on the PRC. So,
um,
I'll stop there to see if you
have any questions unless you
want me to keep going on the
bill, Mr. Chairman.
Um
I guess I would go through the
bill firstly kind of like we
usually do, yeah, yeah. And it's
usually how I go, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you. So, PRC must uh also
allow the IOUs to offer
incentives for customer adoption
of electric and fuel savings
appliances and those incentives
can be stacked. Um, it also
allows for the IOU to um require
to have cost recovery measures
in place, um, such as tariff
riders or base rate increases,
uh, but they, and they
Those rates must be no less than
10% of the electric bill as a
total as and this uh these rates
and tariffs must be approved by
the PRC.
The, um, annual report for
beneficial electrification
submitted to the PRC, uh, also
includes documentation of uh
program expenditures, customer
participation levels, including
the proportion of low-income
household participation, uh, the
estimated energy savings through
beneficial electrification and
demand reductions for fossil
fuel, um, uh, energies and, uh,
the reductions we've seen in
greenhouse gas emissions.
So that's section one of the
bill, and that has to do
entirely with beneficial
electrification and the filing
of those plans at the PRC.
Section 2 of the bill
establishes a requirement for
grid planning, allowing for
beneficial electrification of
our transportation sector and
beyond, um, Mr. Chairman,
members of the committee, I got
into working on this issue, um,
obviously through my committee
in the house when I was tasked
with helping to um put together
the logistics for employing
electric vehicles throughout the
state and the
electric vehicle charging
network, and that's when I was
first confronted with this
issue, which is we just don't
have the power to do it, so
section 2 is essentially a uh
carrots and sticks mechanism to
help our electricity, our IOU
partners to achieve those
guidelines in a um expeditious
and and uh fully transparent
way.
So, um, section 2 requires the
IOU to upgrade their electrical
distribution systems is needed
to achieve state decarbonization
goals, uh, it requires them to
advance planning advanced plan,
engineer, and construct
distribution system hosting and
load capacity, which allow them
to do stuff like preorder
Transformers, which we know are
on a 3 or 4 hour, 4 year delay,
and it would also allow them to
recruit and train and retain
adequate and unqualified
workforce to carry out such
planning?
Uh, within 180 days, the PRC
must establish a maximum and
reasonable energization time
period that may vary depending
on various factors and on each
IOU and uh there is a reporting
requirement that the average
timelines for each um
connectivity has to be also
reported to the PRC so we know
about how long it's taking
everybody to get to where they
need to be and if, um, you know,
we need to push them.
Push them to go faster if we
need to pull back a little bit.
So, um, it also requires the PRC
to adopt rules for individual
distribution generation based on
$1 per kilowatt interconnection
fee instead of what's going on
right now. So if you have
individuals who want to get into
distribution generation on their
own, um, like solar panels,
whatnot, they have to pay for
all that infrastructure, and so
this would allow for a recovery
mechanism so that instead of
having to put out tens of
thousands of dollars to get this
infrastructure. You could then
get access to it for uh an
interconnection fee instead, so
it would really.
Um, incentivize adoption of that
technology. And um it also
requires I use to publish
detailed mapping of distribution
hosting capacity and available
load capacity that would not let
us know what power is where and
where we need to get more power,
uh, where it's not. And lastly,
the IOUs must have sufficient
staffing or particularly um
excited or at least I am about
this provision in the bill and
that um we have been talking a
lot to the workforce solutions
department. They have a
particular.
program that's already um
completely 100% stood up and
funded that would allow for
apprenticeship programming
through participate
participating organizations, um,
such as CNM or um our our uh
Union Brothers and sisters, so
that we can have a free flowing
system that would allow for the
creation of additional
apprenticeships as the IOUs
report needing them and um
hopefully also include
incentives to have them stay in
the state because um these jobs
We continued beneficial
electrification are not going to
go away. We're gonna need more
and more alignment and such to
maintain the grid. Um, so that
is the current status of the
bill, Mr. Chairman, and I'm
happy to answer any questions
from the committee.
OK. Thank you very much, Panics.
Thank you, Mister Chair, and
thank you, Representative for
coming today. Um, this, uh, part
of this mirrors a bill that we
tried a couple of years ago and
just didn't get through the
house floor. It went through the
Senate. It was about grid
planning and moving people along
and providing some um incentives
like your carrot and stick
section. So I appreciate that
it's coming back and, and more
fully fleshed out. The second
point is, Mr. Chair, is that the
Scarcey has said to me,
We would like
Direction in statute.
And so I think this is going
down that road and so Mr. Chair,
my question is, have you had the
opportunity to start talking
with the PRC staff about
language in this bill. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,
Vice Chair Stephanics. Indeed,
we have, um, the timing is
actually quite great, uh,
because the PRC just put out a
grid planning rule themselves
that covers this topic and this
will give them the exact
statutory direction, um, or more
so that they are looking for. We
have met with the PRC. They
have.
given us, um, uh, amendments
and, um, opinions on the bill to
kind of make it so that we know
they can um implement it easily
and draft promulgate rules that
would allow them to achieve
these goals and so um we've been
working very closely with them
and we value value their input
quite a bit.
So, Mr. Chair, thank you for all
that effort, and I would just
like to point out that um a
couple years ago when we did try
this, the IOUs uh one of them
stood up, the P&M stood up and
did support the concept and the
others remain neutral. So I know
that there's been a lot of work
done to work with the utilities
so that they feel like they're
included in this. So thank you
very much for that. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator, uh,
Representative Montoya.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and
Representatives.
Uh
You at the at the beginning of
your presentation,
representative, you mentioned
that
As we are going forward with our
plans to to go more electric and
Uh, go towards.
Carbon neutral that
That you discovered a problem.
Could you just talk briefly more
about
That what that.
Maybe you could enlighten me
just a little bit more. Sure,
um, Mr. Chairman Representative
Montoya, so um for any of you
that are familiar with the
broadband issue in New Mexico.
We kind of have a similar
similar issue with um our grid
and that we have a, uh, it's
called an end user issue, so
delivering power from the grid
to those households that are
throughout, um, you know, New
Mexico, um, mostly in rural
settings, right? Um, that takes
infrastructure and we don't
particularly
have the requisite
infrastructure to accomplish
that end user connection. And so
what this would do is, is use
more renewable energy, put more
renewable energy into the grid
require better grid efficiency
and allow us to expand at a
greater pace to ensure those end
users are connected. Thank you,
Chair.
Representative, I think I'm
gonna try and put it in.
common layman terms.
So since we're going down this
road of
Uh, more electric vehicles and
all of that.
We have an increased
People living in New Mexico, we
are just increasing.
The amount of electricity that's
going to be used.
Would that be fair? And so we
have to create more
Charging stations, once again,
if we want to be able to have it
on the, on the freeways or on
the highways, uh, the
interstates.
Then we've got to create
charging stations, but that as
you just stated, that doesn't
really
Fix the problem in rural New
Mexico. Um, so,
We're gonna need more
infrastructure, more
transformers, more power plants.
But we haven't increased the
number of people.
So what we're gonna do is, since
we're doing that, we have to
increase.
How much more electricity is
produced.
Would that be fair? We have to
create more.
Electricity plus we need more.
Infrastructure to get that.
Because our existing
Infrastructure is not
Adequate to be able to provide
the increased amount of
electricity.
To the end user. Is that fair?
Um, Mr. Chairman and
Representative, I would agree
with you on the point that we
need to get more electricity to
more people in the state. I
don't know if we necessarily
need to create more energy.
We're doing that, um, and we're
doing it in in more efficient
ways, um, and this pill is
designed to also reward
efficiency, so it's not so much
about generation as it is about
distribution and efficient
distribution and end user
connection.
OK, so we're gonna increase the
amount of electricity that is
needed, but we're not going to
have to increase.
More electricity produced.
It seems like we would have to
create more electricity to be
able to.
I'll, I'll, I'll leave it there.
That, that's one of the reasons,
Mr. Chairman. I, I, I think I
know where you're going,
representative, um, that's one
of the reasons why in this bill
we're requiring the I used to
publish detailed mapping and
distribution hosting capacity
and available low capacity,
because in some areas we don't
even know.
So I mean to have a map that
would light up and tell us where
all the power is and is not
would help us, you know, meet,
understand and have a better,
um, concept of what the problem
is, especially in the rural
parts of the state.
OK. Thank you. I appreciate
that. I think that is going to
show.
Somebody doesn't have an
electrical electric vehicle now.
And all of a sudden they have an
electric vehicle.
If they have to get one or
whatever, and they put it in
their home, that there will be
increased.
By in that home, they'll be in
an increased need for
electricity.
Um
So
That gets me to, to really
where, where I'm going with this
is on page 14.
Uh, between section between uh
item or line 6 to line 12.
And you mentioned this earlier
that to allow for this,
Uh, that there will be a cost
that will have to be absorbed by
the utility.
And that, uh,
shall be no less.
Program costs shall be no less.
10%.
Of the customer electric uh
electric bills. So there's going
to be an a a cost to the
consumer.
Every consumer.
Um, Mr. Chairman and uh
representative Montoya, there
could be, um, there's a lot of
ifs in that equation, so one
thing about this is this is
voluntary, right? So that's
gonna be need to be taken into
consideration and um the other
part of this is, yes, it could
allow for the utility to go to
the PRC and ask permission for
either a um tariff writer or a
um increase in the base rate,
but one of the things this bill
has been implemented.
and several other states and one
of the things that we have seen
with increased beneficial elect
electrification is renewable
energy is getting to the point
where it's much less expensive
than um fuel based electricity,
um, and so, uh, we anticipate.
Very strongly that as beneficial
electrification continues to
take hold at drive down the
price of energy quite a bit. Um,
so through economies of scale of
scale essentially. So it's um an
increase on the front end, Mr.
Chair and Representative, but um
with the anticipation and, and
overall it will decrease the
cost potentially below that
which they were originally
paying.
So thank you, Mr. Chair, 11 last
question. I'm, I'm looking at.
Uh, line 10 through 12. It says
utility may propose and the
commission may approve higher
levels of funding.
Now, you stated uh
representative that
That it would be voluntary. The
program's voluntary.
To the consumer
Or is it voluntary to the
utility?
Mr. Chairman, uh, Representative
in is voluntary to the consumer.
It's voluntary to which
households want to participate
in it. OK, so there.
With the rate increase.
Be voluntary, if they choose not
to to participate with the
consumer say, I don't want the
increased cost.
If the PRC passes a, a rate
increase that
I don't believe that's voluntary
to the consumer. Mr. Chairman
represented representative, it
would not be voluntary in the
cost. So thank you, thank you
for that, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Representative.
Thank
you, flu.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
uh, Representative for bringing
this board. I too, I was part of
that hybrid bill with uh Senator
Li Stefanis, and I don't think I
ever apologize for not getting
that.
Pass to the floor, so we tried.
It's not your fault. I know, but
uh I tried really hard to get
this this bill with with help of
others and so.
I know you're bringing me into
the conversation of this, um,
this first time actually I'm,
I'm taking a little bit of a
dive into this bill.
And
You know, I have to agree with
what uh Representative Montoya
is saying if if enough.
Consumers participate in this
program. It's going to affect
the rates and
You know, the PRC is going to
have to make a rate adjustment
unless we put in something, uh,
you know, a beneficial plan like
you're talking uh.
It's not quite the beneficial
plan, but.
Something that would absorb the
cost. Is that
And I haven't fully, uh, flushed
this out, but through the
section where you're talking
about the carrot or the.
But is it an offset? Is it just
how does that help the consumer?
Um, thank you, Mr. Chairman
Representative Lu Han, so
exactly, there are many
incentives that are already
available for these types of
electrification plans and so
this bill is actually great in
that it allows for the stacking
of those incentives, um, you
know, federal and otherwise, and
then it also would allow for a
modest increase if applied by
the the PRC, but remember what
the PRC's job is. The PRC's job
to ensure that access to
electricity is affordable and
widespread. So the PRC.
is going to act as a control
mechanism, um, against any
potential raises in pricing,
they're not gonna, they're
surely not going to let any
outrageous rise in price fly and
so um that is kind of an extra,
um um control mechanism built
into this plan, and again, it's
something that the PRC is taking
on, um, anyways, and has asked
for additional legislative
direction on, um, as evidenced
by the, the grid planning rule
that they just published.
Yeah. Um, I, I, I agree with you
100% that that that is their
mission statement and and they
hold to it, um, and with our
utilities are all of our New
Mexico big utilities, um,
participating in in part of
this, the planning of this bill,
uh, Mr. Chairman Representative
Lujan, yes, they are. We, um,
had participation from a P&M, El
Paso Electric, and Xcel Energy,
and we're hoping, um, in a, in a
different iteration.
once we once we pass this first
portion of it to get
participation with our co-ops as
well, cause we want to make this
environment, you know, the whole
point of this bill, Mr. Mr.
Chairman, uh representative is
to help our utilities and um get
New Mexico to a place where we
have a sufficient and modern
grid, and I don't haven't met a
utility that didn't like this,
the sound of that, so I
appreciate that and through our
good modernization Act, there is
a piece referring to and talking
about uh.
Smart metering. Is that gonna
be?
In, you know, I haven't read
through the whole thing is it
mentioned, uh, we smart metering
is part of the plan, Mr.
Chairman, I'm Representative
Lujan, I'm sure it is. It's all
part of, you know, the
efficiencies and um what we're
asking utilities to ponder and
uh put into place because that's
how you get the most out of
your.
Right, and I bring that up
because in my, in the mention of
the bill that that um we had a
couple of years ago, a sheer
mention of smart eating was kind
of a poison pill for some, um,
if you will. So being able to um
kind of
Be able to talk about that and
understand that is going to
benefit the bill and benefit us
getting this through this year,
um, I do have some questions,
uh, on the bill from the parts
that I have read, um,
Let me see me.
Because
It appears to me, um, as I'm
reading through this and.
Primarily on page 2 and you did
mention it, this is kind of a
We're looking at building up the
workforce.
Start on page 2 and and creating
those apprenticeship programs.
Can you
Um, I, in section.
Um, be line 16, page 2, an
electric public utility shall
have adequate qualified staffing
to achieve the policies and
requirements of the section in
the provisions of section um
62-18-12.
Uh, regarding the expansion of
transportation and
electrification. So is this
primarily um in the workforce,
uh, trade part of this for the
transportation section or is
this for, to help the PRC with
other implementation of, of this
bill. Um, Mr. Chairman
Representative Lu Han. So what
we know is that a large deal of
greenhouse gas emissions come
from the transportation sector,
so um, it's, you know, one of
our primary goals to.
Reduce those emissions and
transportation, but this bill
can have um application
throughout. I mean, not just on
transportation, but we'll see if
uh we'll see it put to good use
through transportation, the
workforce component of it is to
essentially make sure all of our
public utilities have sufficient
workforce to um do all this
planning. We're asking them to
plan ahead. We're asking them
to, um, figure out where they
need electricity. Tell us where
they need electricity, and then
once they put all of those.
um plans in place, you're gonna
need folks to go out and build
the infrastructure and build out
the grid and and make sure end
user um connections are
completed, so that all of that
takes bodies, and so it is the
intention through the workforce
component of this bill to um
essentially stand up programs we
already have such programs, but
um
To
Augment and support those
programs so that utilities can
Go to CNN and and tap um folks
that are in these programs and
learning how to be electricians
or if we have someone in a
journeyman program um through
our our unions for
participating, the utilities
will know where to get go to get
that workforce and um sustain
that workforce. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. It's a, it's a great, um,
so I would assume that this is
job creating and it, and you
refer to
The public utilities Act, the
renewable Energy Act, and the
efficiency use of Energy Act.
And meeting those um.
Those requirements for staffing,
I just want to say that's
commendable. We, I don't think
you see too many bills that are
really um getting into the, the,
the, the grid of what uh the
workforce and what it's going to
take to really establish um
The grid modification, the the
growth in infrastructure needs
that we we have for this state,
um, so this, I really, I just
want to say I like this section
because it
We, it's gonna cost a lot of
money, just quite frankly for us
to get into the modification of
infrastructure.
Uh, and that's cross referencing
broadband, that's
transportation, that's, you
know, our roads and our, our
grid and everything, and I think
you're, you're trying to
accomplish this in this
building. It's just a, this is a
huge, a huge thing. This is a
huge deal. I want to commend you
on that part of this bill as
well. Thank you, um.
So the other part and we're
getting into this, I'm gonna go
back to the um page 4 section uh
F story line when you're talking
about the commissionsshall adopt
rules that replace the current
practice whereby an individual
customer installing distributed
generation is held responsible
for the cost of upgrading share
distribution equipment with a
reasonable $1 per kilowatt
in connection fee that would
That new distributed generation
customers.
Pay to help defray the cost of
interconnecting you distributed
generation systems to the grid,
provided that the fee is
sufficient for an electric
public utilities to sufficiently
and timely recovery costs.
Residential customersgizing
transportation, electrification,
or beneficial elect
electrification shall not be
subject to the interconnection
fees. This just goes back to to
what we were talking about. I
think this is, this is important
and giving them the ability
work.
should be the PRC to to get to
promulgate those rules is
important, um.
Have you,
Have they, have you really
discussed what those costs are
though to how they will, um.
What the cost is right now for
the these type of upgrades. Um,
Mr. Chairman Representative
Lujan, are you referring to like
what the cost is to um install
this type of.
Infrastructure at say like one's
house. Yes, I, I, I mean, I, Mr.
Chairman, uh, Representative, I
don't, I can't give you an exact
quote, but I know it's probably
in the tens of thousands of
dollars. I mean, if anybody's
put solar up in your house, you
know.
OK. Thank you. Thank you for
that. Um.
I just, it's, it's very
expensive. My neighbors just did
it, Mr. Cha.
And um we accidentally that uh
we actually got their bill.
We had to, um, it was, it was
remedied quite quickly, but it's
expensive, um.
So, uh,
I, I just like that there's a
lot that this is doing. This is
a heavy lift and you're really
getting into the the nuts and
bolts. I'd like to further that
conversation with you, um, but
my, my last question is going to
go to page 6, line 20 in the
definition section uh flexible
interconnection
or.
ization tariff the tariff.
And your definition says means
way to energize a new load.
Or interconnect a dis
distributed energy resource.
Excuse me, I'm holding back a
cough, that's where you hear me.
Excuse me.
Um,
to energize a new load or
interconnect a distributed
energy resource to an electric
public utilities distribution
system that is governed by a set
of rules requirements, and
includes an agreement and so on.
My question goes back to a
tariff.
Is, is this an actual tariff or
because the definition doesn't
refer to it as being a tariff in
its true meaning. Can you
explain that, Mister Chair.
Uh, Mr. Chairman, Representative
uh Luhan.
So, um, I am not a public
utility lawyer and that is
pretty in the weeds, but I think
that um flexible interconnection
or an energization tariff can
essentially mean the same thing.
It's a fee that the utility will
charge you for your connection
to their grid.
Using this equipment that will
generate electricity and allow
you to um send that electricity
to the grid.
All right, I'm just confused
with the definition because it
doesn't specifically say that,
you know.
Um, so I just like review that
and make sure that we understand
that it is a tariff.
Uh, and Mr. Chairman
Representative, uh, just got
some information in this
context, the tariff is just a
rule that the utility has in the
books for its customers, so
tariff can be anything the
utility wants it to be.
Perfect. Yeah.
Thank you. That clears that then
that justifies the.
The definition used here, um,
and I think that's all I have
right now and I'm just really
glad that we're bringing forward
another piece of legislation
that really helps us get to the
development of uh infrastructure
that is needed for a good
modernization, um, and we'll
talk more about this. The other
part I'd just like to say is
that if we don't regionalize,
and if we don't look at a an RTO
originalized um way of uh
interconnecting our grid system.
Um
We don't have a plan for that.
um, this, this gets us in the
place for a plan for that, and
we're not gonna meet.
Kind of the the universal goals
that we have for um.
For our
For our state specifically, but
for uh a region of states that
that needs to uh work together
to actually work on that cost
and bringing those, those costs
down, and that's really how
we're gonna be able to do that.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and Mr.
Chairman, if I may, um, I just
had another thought back to
representative Montoya's
question about cost. Um, I
forgot to mention that we have
seen and expect to continue to
see a lot of revenue generated
just from electric vehicles and.
utilization of fast charging,
and so, um, that is another
factor that should keep price
factor.
For it, uh, down.
OK, we have, uh, uh, about 15
minutes left, and we have 4
people on the list, so please
keep that in mind. Um, as I
said, we'll, we'll, when we hit
the, the time, we'll, we'll just
move on. Uh, representative
Herrera.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Representative for bringing this
bill forward and anything that
approves rural infrastructure,
I'm all about. I just, I just am
curious about um a line here,
and I don't unders I don't know
enough about this. It says
public utility means public
utility that is not also a
distribution cooperative
utility. What is a distribution
cooperative utility, a co op.
co op, OK, so.
So this is for public utilities,
but not for uh co-ops. So is
that what Mr. Chairman
Representative correct at this
time, yeah, at this time, so to
say I, I was wondering if that
because I didn't know how a
public utility couldn't be a
distribution public utilities,
so, so the co-ops are not
supporting this bill at the
time. Uh, Mr. Chairman
Representative Herrera, um, just
with a transportation
electrification plans, um, the
hopes are not subject to them,
comma yet. Um, it's not that
they don't support the bill,
it's just that they present an
entirely new set of of of
issues, right? Um, H co op is,
um, you know, in terms of their
access to capital and the
ability to build out
infrastructure without raising
costs. I mean, because they're
much smaller in nature, um,
those types of changes tend to
amplify, you know, or felt
acutely by their customers and
so.
It's our intention with power of
New Mexico to um find this
partnership within the public
utilities, get them going on
this plan and then uh eventually
with the help, hopefully of
other, you know, people, bigger
brains than myself, uh, figure
out a way to get the co-ops and
board and I think I'm pretty
sure that that will be uh
directly dependent upon our
ability to connect them with
cotton costs for that
infrastructure that we're gonna
ask them to include, um, in
their service.
territories, right, because this
stuff is really expensive and
they just don't have the same
ability to defray costs at the
larger utilities do. So that's
kind of the, that's a, it's a
one step forward kind of thing.
um, Mr. Chair and, and
representative. Thank you for
that, uh, where does Kit Carson
stand on this?
Uh, Mr. Chairman Representative
Herrera, I do believe that Kit
Carson has had representatives
on our call. We meet biweekly,
um, by Zoom, and, and we have
again over 60 different
stakeholders, uh, I do believe
they've been participating in
the calls. I don't, I am, I
can't, uh, I know that we
haven't received any specific
requests for amendments, but I
can check back with everybody
and um give you an update as to
exactly what they've done and
how they've participated, and
Mr. Chair and rep, you don't
have to do that. I can do that
for you. You don't need to do
that, but again
And if we don't have the co ops
and we're not gonna be able to
do anything in the in the in in
rural infrastructure somehow if
we can't kind of
Figure out how we
Get them to come along, it's
probably money. Well, Mr.
Chairman, uh, Representative
Herera, I just got a message
that they they are engaging
productively with us and they're
in support of the goals of
legislation. Another issue that
we have is they're not within
the purview of the PRC and so
this goal aims to um directly
work with the PRC to achieve
these goals first and then um we
can work on the co op portion of
this cause I agree with you if
we don't bring in the co ops a
large part of parts of New
Mexico.
are under the the territory of
the co op, so we absolutely need
to figure out a way to bring
them in in a a productive and
proactive manner. We don't want
to set them up to fail as this
issue, so we want to empower
them to meet these goals. Thank
you for that, Mr. Chairman.
That's all I had.
Thank you and the center woods.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Uh, Madam Representative.
We understand your bill.
You are asking for a tariff
rider.
Uh, to be put on a customer's
bill to do the things that
described in this, in this bill,
including uh interconnect fees.
Uh
High fish and see, electric
appliances.
Uh, planning,
Um
Different things.
But essentially that's what the
bill asked for.
is a, a
Tariff to be added to the
customer's bills to do this.
Um, Mr. Chairman, Senator Woods,
um, the bill would allow
utilities to implement a writer
if they so choose, but remember
the program um in terms of, you
know, electric uh electrical.
I, I can never remember the name
of this program, but the
efficiency programs, those
remember are voluntary, so um
it's only for customers that
choose to participate in the
program, but this bill would
allow the utilities to pursue a
tariff if they choose to and if
they need to, but under the um
under the watchful eye of the
PRC. If the PRC doesn't approve
the tariff, they won't be able
to do it.
Well, that's what, I guess
that's what I should have said.
It allows the PRC to approve a
tariff.
To socialize these costs.
That some of the hiccups that
has been with community solar is
that the connect costs have been
so high. This would be a tariff
to help with that amongst other
things you're talking about, to
socialize the cost of those
interconnect fees.
To be put on more people's
bills, the tariff to be
socialized across many people's
bills.
Uh
What is what a tariff does. And
so, essentially, I, I'm trying
to
Kind of boil it down, maybe I'm
trying to boil it down too much.
The, the PRC have, have you
talked to the PRC about this
bill.
Mr. Chairman, uh, Senator Woods,
perhaps this will help. Um, we
borrowed a lot of these concepts
from your transportation
electrification bill. So it
allows um the public utilities
to do exactly what it is that
they're doing within that
context. Um, so the, we have
been, uh, we have consulted with
the PRC. We have incorporated,
um.
We have incorporated what they
have asked us to incorporate,
they're gonna be getting us some
specific amendments to ensure
that they can um promulgate
rules to be effective, um, to
make this bill effective, but,
um, the PRC is generally is very
supportive of this concept, and
it's not something that we
haven't already done again in
the transportation
electrification context. the
only other question I have.
Have you got a, uh
A budget increase for the PRC to
promulgate the rules.
Excuse me, Mr. Chairman Senator
Woods, that's a great question.
Um, the PRC did ask for some
help on this, you know, in the
form of an FTE or something
there, there, uh, thereabouts,
um, we have heard them, um, it,
it's helpful having the vice
chair of house appropriations as
a co-sponsor on this bill, but
hoping that she can uh help us
get the PRC more help so that.
They can take on this additional
burden, but we've also, uh,
designed it so that it's not
that we're not asking for an
entirely new report we're just
allowing a separate section to
go into reports that already
have to be made on, um, account
of the of the utility, so we did
hear the PRC. We want to make
sure that they're adequately
staffed and they they have the
the scope, the bandwidth to do
this, um, but we're hoping it's
not gonna be a
huge increase in Mr.
Chair.
And Madam Chair, that
You would put.
Money.
Somewhere in here to promulgate
rules for the PRC because it
does nothing but to help with
their case.
Uh, in the future.
Um, I don't think it would kill
your bill.
But I think it would
light up the fact that they need
more money to do this.
So that's what I'm getting at.
I'm not.
Not critical, I'm just
Thinking it through.
Mr. Chairman, Senator, I agree
100%. PRC just like so many of
our other agencies is
understaffed and they do a great
job with what they've got
the help. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Senator, Senator
Wirth, briefly.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Just a
question quickly about again,
Representative Hahn was asking
about this on page 4.
It's the um
The new fee for hooking up a
solar panels when I'm seeing
there, um, and I just want to
make sure I understand.
How that works. So, so, so
basically in an area, and we've
had this issue now where there's
so many panels that the utility
comes back and says you can't
hook up because the cost is too
high. Um, is this gonna
basically mandate
So in an area like that where
there's huge demand for solar.
Everyone's paying a fee, whether
you're in a high demand or not.
And now the utility is gonna go
ahead and
be required to allow them to
hook up? Am I reading that
correctly? Uh, Mr. Chairman, uh,
Leader Worth.
So, uh, it does seem the
language of the bill, and again,
that's um pretty uh a nuanced
public utility law question that
I may not be able to handle
right now, but could get you an
answer later, but I think it
does, you know, state that the
utilities to provide
requirements for a flexible
interconnection or energization
tariff and allow a customer to
use the optional flexible
interconnection or energization
tariff as an alternative to a
system upgrade that would
otherwise be required by an
electric public utility in
response to the customer's
request to interconnect or
energize the distributed.
resource. So it sounds like, you
know, you, you could, um, as an
alternative to a system upgrade,
so sounds that language sounds
like to me that you have the, if
you wanna go with just the
system upgrade yourself, you
want to pay for it, you can, or
you can go through the optional
uh flexible interconnection cost
repair cost. So we definitely
want to look at this section,
and I just want to make sure.
So, basically, if you put in
The a residential customer who's
putting in a charging system.
They're not going to be charged
a fee is what I'm reading the
last sentence there to say. It's
the solar system where you're
connecting to the grid, uh,
the last sentence, residential
customers, energizing
transportation, electrification,
or beneficial electation shall
not be subject to the connection
fee.
And I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman and
later work, that's what I'm
reading as well.
So again, I just think this is
an important provision. I just
want to make sure that, again,
it does mean that in an area
where there's not huge solar
Individual residential solar,
everyone's gonna be paying a
fee, where right now I don't
think they would be paying a
fee. I think it would depend on
whether you're in a high demand
area as to whether you've got to
upgrade the um the system to, to
get on the system.
But I think this is a big issue,
you know, I don't wanna, I want
to make sure we're not
discouraging.
You know, use of, of residential
solar by allowing the utility to
basically recover all of its
costs, which means the fee is so
high that no one wants to do it,
so it's defined, the fine line
there, and I see you're trying
to find the balance, but I just
want to flag that we'll talk
about it more as it goes
forward. Thank you. Thank you
for bringing this. Thank you.
OK. We're pretty close to being
a time we have one person left
on the list for something really
brief. Yes. I think um with this
allow um people in North.
West, New Mexico in Navajo
country, where the distribution
lines go right past them, but
they don't have access. Would
this help them?
gain that access, Mr. Chairman
representative Ferrari, um, I
know exactly what you're talking
about and you have to see it to
believe it, um, when you're out
in Navajo country and these huge
power lines and people's homes
underneath them and they have no
electricity, it's, it's um
shocking, uh, Mr. Chairman,
Representative Ferrari, it
would, I mean, the bill wouldn't
mandate that uh utilities
directly connect those
households to the lines above
them, but it would, um, create
an atmosphere and atmosphere and
also hold them accountable for
ensuring those houses.
old s are connected to to the
grid, um, so that's exactly what
this is incentivizing, which is
allowing the utilities, the, the
space and the incentive to
expand their networks and make
their networks more efficient,
so that, um, you know, some
sometimes the cost of endpoint
connection or prohibitive. Same
with broadband, right? And so,
um, this again is designed to
drive down those costs, um,
those cost drivers and allow
them to connect.
And also um remind the utilities
of their, they have an
obligation under the Public
Utility Act to ensure that New
Mexicans are connected to these
utilities, and so this is also
reminding them of that
obligation that they already
have through the public
utilities Act. Great. Thank you,
Mr. Chair and thank you for
bringing this forward.
Thank you, Representative, and
thank you, Representative.
Thank you very much
one last point, Mr. Chairman,
um, and leader worth the, the
interconnection cost is actually
something that the when the new
renewable solar um folks had
asked us to include, so happy to
talk to you more about that.
Thank you very much.
OK, we're gonna move on now to
solar net metering protections
with Senator Stephanics, uh, a
reminder to members of the
public, uh, either, uh, present
or listening online, these bills
are posted on the NM Leis
website.
Uh, it's, you, you'll want to
navigate.
Uh, it's legends.gov, then
you'll want to navigate to
committees and water and Natural
Resources committees, and then
um there's a, uh, it, it should
be.
You have to poke around a
little, it should be there
somewhere.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of
the committee today with me, I
have uh Mr. Christian Casillas.
He is the executive director of
the Coalition for Sustainable
Communities, and I'll let him
introduce himself before we get
into the presentation.
Right, thank you, uh, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee, uh,
good to see you all again. My
name is Christian Casillas. I'm
the executive director of the
coalition of Sustainable
Communities New Mexico, where a
coalition of um
Cities and counties, uh, that
include, uh, the cities of
Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Las
Cruces.
Um, counties of of Santa Fe
County, Bernalillo County, Los
Alamos County, Taos County, and
our constituency represents
about 50% of the population of
the state of New Mexico, um,
and, uh, one of our priorities
is uh climate and climate action
and sustainability with a focus
on equity and the legislation
that uh we're sharing today.
Um, is, is really a focus on the
most vulnerable households in,
in New Mexico that have an
opportunity, um, to, uh, benefit
from significant savings with
rooftop solar.
So,
um, you have received a
PowerPoint as well as a bill,
and a few points from the
PowerPoint. I'm not going to
read everything, but the context
is very important. Um, I'm
sorry, the pages are not
numbered. We'll get that
corrected for the future. Uh,
while the majority of rooftop
solar owners nationwide are
middle and upper income programs
such as Solar for All provide
opportunities for meaningful
bill savings through grants,
leases or, or.
loans to get solar on roofs of
low-income households.
328,000 low-income households
are in New Mexico. Those earning
less than 80% of the area median
income.
That mix of low income
households is fairly evenly
split between Hono homeowners
and renters.
90,000 low-income households in
New Mexico spend 20% of their
income on electricity and
heating compared to national
average of 2%.
So M nerd has energy, minerals,
natural resources department has
received $156 million from EPAs,
greenhouse gas reduction fund as
part of the Solar for All
program. This program requires
that 75% of the allocated funds
provide a minimum of 20% annual
savings for low income
households through energy
efficiency and solar-related
projects. Solar projects could
be through residential.
to owned or leased solar
community solar or shared cellar
in multi-family affordable
housing.
We estimate that 2000 to 5000
low-income households could
receive residential leased or
owned systems through this
program over the next 4 years.
The purpose of this bill is to
provide stability and financial
predictability for current and
low-income solar systems by
safeguarding the financial
benefits of net metering.
Uh, the bill will exempt low
income solar customers from rate
riders for standby charges or
incillary services for new
interconnected customers.
It adds the definition for low
income customer to the public
utility Act defined as 8 80% of
the AMI are lower and it directs
the IOUs to administer
verification of low-income
customers through an annual
questionnaire.
And at this time Mister Casillas
will go through the bill.
Chair members of the committee
that the bill is, is really very
simple, um, just 33 components,
uh, the, the multitude of the
pages in the bill is really due
to uh clean up of the, the
statute of alphabetizing um the
definitions. So if we turn, uh,
flip through the
First
Uh, 8 pages, you get to page 8,
those 1st 7 pages are, are
really just about um
alphabetizing the the
definitions in the bill.
And if you look on the bottom of
page 8, line 23 H, um there's
the introduction of the
definition of a low-income
customer.
And it's being defined, uh, as a
customer and electric public
utility with an annual household
income at or below 80% of the
county area median income, um,
as published by the United
States Department of Housing and
Urban Development, and uh we
have chosen this definition of
low income to be consistent with
the state's community solar
program, which defines low
income as 80% AMI.
As well as the requirements for
the federal solar for all
program, of which the senator uh
mentioned that Mnerd has 156
million um.
The, uh, to qualify for the
benefits of that program. You
also have to be a low income
household, which is defined
again as 80% AMI.
And then if we turn through, uh,
to
Page 14, so that the subsequent
uh pages between 8 and 14, um,
again, are just uh the
resentation of the the statue,
um,
And if you look at line 19.
On page 14, that's where the
exemption comes from any
ancillary, uh, uh, any standby
charges or ancillary services,
um, it exempts a low income
customer. So in particular, it
defines a new interconnected
customer, it has a definition
and the new language is uh
written, but does not include a
low income customer.
So it exempts them from any
future, uh, standby charges.
And then the, the final uh
section of the bill, the final
thing that this legislation does
is the qualification, uh, as a
low income customer. And again,
we've made this consistent with
the uh statewide community solar
uh program. Um, so it lists a
number of different federal
programs that require uh
documentation of low income
status.
Uh, so, a, a customer of an
electric public utility may
qualify as a low income customer
of our providing to the utility
that provides the customer
service, either.
Um, assigned self attestation
that the customer's household
income and household size
qualified customer as a
low-income customer and uh for
those of you who haven't been
following community solar, there
was an amendment made to the
rules, uh, following nationwide,
bestide, uh, best practices for
income qualification and
reducing barriers to low-income
households that allows for self
attestation. So this is just,
um, again, consistent.
with the, the statewide
community solar program.
And then as well,
Uh, it, uh, uh.
Um, you can, uh, customer can
also, uh, show proof of
enrollment in a number of
federal programs such as SNAP,
Li Heap, Medicaid, etc.
And then on the last page of the
bill, Bill 16, Section B, um,
the bill mandates the public
utilities, um, by December 31st,
2025, and in the month of
December of each year
thereafter, um, the public
utility shall notify its
customers of their requirements
to qualify as a low-income
customer and instructions on how
to submit any required
documentation.
An electric public utility shall
not require a customer who is
qualified as a low income
customer to requalify as a
low-income customer within 5
years of the customer's last
qualification. Um, and these,
uh, systems, uh, the solar
systems that would be installed
on on households have lifetimes
of 20 to 25 years, and, uh, if
they, it's also important to,
to, to point out that the public
utilities are
mailing out monthly bills,
flyers, etc. in their database,
they include all sorts of um
components for every customer
from the the meter number to the
name, um, to the address and so
adding just an additional field
as to whether they're low income
or not should be um a trivial
uhministrative burden for the uh
public utilities.
So, Mr. Chair, Mr. Casilla has
had conversations with energy,
minerals and natural resources
department about the use of the
funds. He's had conversations
with the PRC and he has
approached uh P&M two different
times and with no response yet
as to their um.
Supporter opposition.
Thank you. We'll stand for
questions. And uh uh chair
representatives. I've also been
in conversation with um SPS and
have reached out to to EP and I
have had uh several productive
conversations and meetings with
with PNM, um, but they have not
yet, uh, provided us with any
feedback.
Thank you very much. We'll go to
the committee for suburbs in
Lujan.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chair.
Was this a, a, a piece of
legislation we saw a couple of
years ago as well, are related
to the efforts of uh there was a
bill. I knew that, um.
No, so this isn't related to
that, Mr. Chair Representative
Lu Han, we did not um have
something specific spelled out
for low income at that time. It
was included in the community
solar bill, but it was not
spelled out. OK. So this
So this is specifically uh in
regards to community solar. Is
that correct, Mr. Chair?
Uh,
chair.
representative,
uh, no, it's not related to
community solar in other than
it's uh um the low income
qualification is consistent with
community solar. This is
specifically for a residential
household that installs rooftop
solar, um, to be the, the to be
exempt from any future rate
riders that a utility has a
right to impose as as an
example.
2014, uh, P&M in the rape case
proposed adding a $6 per
kilowatt charge uh for any
rooftop solar homeowner, um,
just as an example, a typical
household to meet their um,
their total consumption would
have a 6 kilowatt system, uh,
that would be $36 a month, that
would be an annual cost of $480
and so this would go a large way
to eroding the financial
benefits.
fits that a low income household
uh could have if they um are
able to participate in this
program and put rooftop solar
on.
Thank you, thank you for that.
That, that helps me quite a bit
and you know, um.
We do want to make things
affordable as you know for um
everyone to get to participate
in renewable energy and um.
Are there any programs though,
federal or otherwise that
pertain to, uh, this, uh, any
kind of subsidies that are
already existing, Mister Chair.
Um
Chair representative, uh, there,
so rooftop solar in, in general,
there's a 30% um tax credit for
any household that that puts on
rooftop solar. There's a 10%
state tax credit, um,
Uh, as an example in the, the
city of Santa Fe ran a program
called Solarize Santa Fe a few
years ago, the coalition of
Sustainable Communities in New
Mexico manage that program, um,
in partnership with several
local NGOs, um, and there were
subsidies from the city of $5000
per installation to reduce the
cost for qualifying low-income
households, but there are, there
are not any current um uh
federal uh subsidies for low
income households.
except this program, Solar for
all, uh, which will launch in
the coming year, $156 million
75% of uh of that entire amount
has to go to benefits for low
income households that could be
through uh grants through
subsidized loans through
low-income solar lease programs,
which I, I mentioned yesterday
that the New Mexico climate
investment Center is focusing on
um through community solar, uh,
through shared.
Solar in um multi-family
affordable housing, all of that
will go for benefiting low
income households is defined by
80% AMI or lower.
Great, so that this then would
become another Mr. uh,
stackable, um, resource for
individuals to use, Mr. Chair.
Uh, chair representative. So, so
this bill is really, it's, it's,
um, it's, uh, defensive, it
provide it it wants to ensure
this program could go forward.
There could be 50 to 10,000
household low income households
that will get a low income uh
rooftop solar in the coming
years, and then, um, 5 years
down the road, uh, utility could
go to the PRC request, uh,
standby charge.
just be added for any um
household with solar and all of
those financial benefits could
be lost. And so this is saying
that any future um uh uh
attempts by the PR by public
utility to um add on uh uh costs
for standby charges and
ancillary services, uh, uh,
low-income household would be
exempt from those.
I appreciate, uh, appreciate
that. Is there, um, is there
been um analysis of how many
households that would affect
and.
If then those charges are
incurred by those low income
households and who absorbs the
cost, Mister Chair.
Uh
Chair representative, um, can
you clarify the question, are
you, are you asking whether or
not, uh, if, if the low-income
households are exempt from the
charges, where would those
charges then shift to?
That is correct, Mr. Chair.
chair representative, so, um,
uh, in the
In the slide deck that was
passed out, I believe there is a
um
Uh, question on the, the, the um
last page and in there just as
an example, so there's currently
760,000 customers in the IOU
service or residential customers
in the IOU service territory.
Uh, I have yet to see really
good numbers of how many
households actually have rooftop
solar. It's something on the
order of 50,000 and that's split
between residential and
commercial, um, and
Those again we expect that
anywhere from 20 to 10,000
households in the coming 5
years, low income households
might have the opportunity to
put solar on their roof, and so,
uh, that's less than 1% of all
customers and so they, I, I
think the concern that that
small percentage would be
significantly uh uh shifting
fixed a large amount of fixed
charges to be subsidized by
other consumers is is really
negligible.
And one thing, if that, if that
does end up being a concern, one
thing that um utilities can do
is they can say, hey, look, we
have uh 50,000 households with
solar. We, we don't think
they're paying for the fixed
charges, we want to uh add a
monthly charge, um, but of that
50, example, 50,000 households,
5000 households are low income,
um, those low income are exempt
from those.
charges, so let's shift the
charges that we, we would.
Put to everybody, um, just to
the non low income, uh, rooftop
solar households. So that so
that the the non low income
rooftop solar households, in
theory could take on pain for
those uh fixed costs for the low
income households.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. So this.
This is a temporary fix to what
then could have a loophole where
they would then encur charges
down the road if.
The intention of the PRC would
um
Aow
Does that make sense?
Well, I'm Mr. Chair and
Representative, the um, we have
to keep in mind that we have
some federal money backing this
initiative right now and as the
federal money.
phases out, we would have to
revisit this. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Those are
all my questions. I appreciate
the efforts here and um I'm just
trying to, you know, you're,
you're going down the path of a
line of my questions.
If we do this work and we get
this in place, um, there are
loopholes that still exist that
could the charges could go in a
different way, go back to the
consumers that need it the most.
Is that, is that what I'm
hearing? No, uh it it chair um
representative, the, so I don't,
there isn't a loophole for uh so
what I was um trying to explain
it, and I know it can get
confusing is if, if there is
concern about uh cross
upsidization of rooftop solar
households, not paying um the
fair share of fixed charges, and
I should point out that that
argument typically doesn't
Uh, take into account the
benefits that distributed
generation has for all other
customers by reducing, um, needs
to upgrade local distribution
feeders, etc. So, uh, really a
fair evaluation would be of the
costs and benefits, but if we
just go down the road of saying
that, um, a fear that, OK,
they're not paying the fixed
cost. We want to charge them
each uh uh um uh a monthly fee
per kilowatt, um, but the
low-income households are
exempt.
Then that
That charge that they're
concerned of concerned of would
just be distributed among the
non low income solar households.
So this would by uh passing this
legislation, you're not saying
that um that other not that the
rest of the, the, uh, uh,
customers are going to take on
this burden. Um, it could be
just distributed to other uh
solar households. Thank you.
Thank you.
for the clarification, um, thank
you, Mr. Chair, one of my
questions.
Thank you, Representative,
Representative Herrera.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
um, presenters. Thank you,
Senator. Um, I already did call
the town hall meeting, figured
out, you know, or low income,
80% is 41,000 a year for Rio
Ribe County.
Then I realized I read through
your questions and uh real
co-ops aren't included again, so
you know, it's kind of the
the the I I just wanted to know
uh what were your
conversations with real co-ops
and if they chose to enter this,
could they?
Mr Chair representative, um,
yeah, this, this is, uh, uh, a
common um
Uh, challenge of, of legislation
where the rural electric co ops
often present the argument that
70% of their constituency is
tends to be low income, um, and
so concern about rooftop solar
owners, um, getting greater
benefits and, and cost shifts
ending up on some of those other
low income households that don't
receive solar.
Um, at the end of the day, the,
the decisions for uh, for
example, rooftop additional
rooftop solar charges, that's a,
uh, my understanding is that's a
board decision of of each rural
electric co op that they would
bring before the the PRC, um,
so, uh, I would hope that, um,
the representation, the, the
boards of each are all electric
co op, um, would be looking out
for the interest of of
All of their low-income
constituents, but also the low
income constituents that do get
to participate in, um, would get
to participate in uh in the
solar for our program and are
able to receive rooftop solar,
um, and, and wouldn't, um,
wouldn't bring that, uh, uh,
proposal to to the PRC, um,
they, they certainly could be
included in this legislation
requiring them to to exempt, um.
Uh, low-income households and uh
that's a conversation that,
that, uh, uh, we have not yet
had an opportunity to have with
the, the Rolectric co-ops, um,
their position has, has, uh,
traditionally been um
Uh, this looks like it fits for
the, the, the IOUs, um, but, uh,
uh, we, we want to, to be
autonomous on this.
That's how I have Mr. Chair.
Thank you.
Any further questions from the
committee?
Representing tomorrow.
Mr. Chair, and
On, on the bill, I believe it
read that if somebody gets
qualified for low income that
they don't have to requalify
within 5 years?
Is that correct?
Mr. Chair.
Chair representative, that's
correct. And, and Mr. Chair, and
presenter, why would that be? I
mean, somebody could really
scale up, make a lot of money
from today in 5 years and been a
lot better place, and why should
they qualify as a low income
then.
Chair representative, um, uh,
that, that's a perfectly valid
point, um, there, uh, there
isn't really an exact science to
this, uh, we wanted to reduce
the burden um for a low income
struggling household to require
to submit paperwork consistently
every year. Um, uh, we, we could
have said that they only have to
to qualify once, which I believe
is the case in the community.
er program, um, but due to the,
the variability of uh a
household's income, we figured
that 5 years was a a a
reasonable, um, window to to
have them requalify. And and
thank you for that answer, Mr.
Chair and presenter, so.
I would feel a lot more
comfortable and feel like I
could digest it better if at the
time that you qualified.
You were, you were at that.
Level
And then
Instead of, you know, somebody,
and, and that person might have
a lot of money here and not
qualify now in 5 years from now,
he might qualify.
So, I could see where that
5 years seems like a lot.
I know that
I started
At a real low income and I've,
I've done a lot better five
years later than that, it just
doesn't.
Sound right to me somehow.
Maybe it'll, maybe it'll work
work its way through.
And uh thank you, Mr. Chair and
thank you presenters.
Seeing, uh, no further questions
from the committee. Thank you
very much.
Uh, we'll move on to the next
bill.
No, I got it.
So committee members, now we
have a chair Matthew McQueen
presenting the Department of
Game and Fish and the state Game
Commission reform and funding.
Mr. Chair, which one do you want
to start with?
It's all one bill,
OK, I have too much paper here.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
Thank you, ma'am. Sure. Um, so
this is the reform package that
we talked a little bit about
yesterday.
Um, it's, uh, it's been passed
out. Uh, it's on the website,
it's the 202 numbers uh
228949.2, um.
So this is an evolution of past
efforts. Uh, this is the 2nd
discussion draft we've worked
on, um.
Uh, during the interim, um, this
won't be the final bill. Uh,
we're still working on language,
uh, we're still open to
suggestions.
So as I described yesterday, the
bill has 3 key parts. The first
is an update and modernization
of the department and the
commissions, uh, mission to be a
broader wildlife agency, to not
just game and fish, um,
Any wildlife in New Mexico, the
goal of the bill is to give the
department and the commission,
the authority.
To handle any wildlife in New
Mexico, and the discretion.
To choose whether or not uh
there uh involvement is
appropriate.
Second part of the bill is
reforming the game commission
itself, uh, the, um,
Nomination process, the
selection process, the retention
process. So this is something
we've seen recently, uh, in
regards to other, uh,
Boards, committees, regions,
things like that we're trying to
solidify the commission. And the
third part is the financing. Uh,
we have heard from
Uh, stakeholders.
From day one, I, I, I mean, I've
been working on this, um, I
think for 8 years, um, that
If we're going to expand the
mission of the department, it
can't just be on hunting and
fishing license fees.
That, you know, other
stakeholders who would have a um
More involvement in the expanded
department should also have a
financial commitment and, and
that's the case. So we're
increasing the uh uh fees for
the department and this is
something they've asked for. Uh,
there was a bill, uh, Senator
Compos isn't here. There was a
bill previously passed the
Senate.
Um, so that's one part of it.
Uh, the department is receiving
money from the land of
enchantment Legacy Fund. That's
another part of it. And then
there's a proposal uh in uh
Chairman Small isn't here today,
but he would be a co-sponsor of
this bill, and he is working on
providing funding uh through the
Grow funds, the government.
Something, something I, I forget
the acronym, but it's a 3-year
commitment. I think it's, it's
either 3 million a year for 3
years or 3.3 million, so about
10 million over 3 years, uh, and
the, the way that fund is
designed is it provides funding
for new initiatives, it, it
creates benchmarks, and if the
agency is uh using that funding
beneficially, then it shifts to
permanent funding.
Uh, so it's a 3 year sort of uh
trial run.
Uh, Madam Chair, with that, I'd
like to go through some of the,
some of the details of the bill.
Um, so it, it takes the current,
uh,
Game commission in changes it to
a wildlife commission and
changes the name of the
department to the Department of
Wildlife. The, the current game
commission is 7 members, uh, 5
are at large. Uh, there's an, an
ag position and there's a, a
conservation position, although
those positions are not well
defined and have not been
Um
Uh, stre strenuously adhered to.
So sometimes,
The public hasn't known, OK,
who, who is the conservation
representative on the game
commission.
Because we just don't know. Um,
so this, uh, clarifies all those
uh it remains 3 at-large
positions, uh, there are
geographic and uh political
party diversity requirements.
Uh, and then it has 4 sort of
position seats, and those
include a rancher or farmer,
conservationist, a hunter or
angler in a scientist and has
some descriptions for what
qualifies people for those
seats. Um, I, I, I'll highlight
some of the things we're still
sort of thinking about working
on.
The at-large members, uh, a
prior draft of this bill had one
member from each congressional
district.
Uh, which is a pretty typical
way to do something when you
have, um, when you're spreading
appointments out in New Mexico.
Um, there were some
dissatisfaction with that, given
our new congressional districts,
uh, that you could have 2
members from Albuquerque and a
third from Santa Fe. So, uh, we
changed it to, uh, no more than
one per county. Um, that's
still, uh, something we're
looking at, you know, could we
broaden that further. Um,
position for the rancher or
farmer, um, still sort of
thinking about
a language that uh might
strengthen that, that it's not
someone who uh engages on in
ranching and farming.
Um, on the side, as it were, but
someone who really earns their
income from that. I'm not quite
sure how to define that. Um, I
know there are some pretty
stringent IRS definitions of
ranchers and farmers and I think
that's overkill for this
purpose. So we're sort of
thinking about that.
Um, the hunter or angler
position, um, it's been
suggested that
The, uh, this is on page 6, line
5, the requirement is that they
have held a hunting or fishing
license for each of the previous
4 years.
It was suggested that we we
change.
Um, hunting and change that to
that or to an end, to be hunting
and fishing license, reached in
the past 4 years. Uh, I
personally think that's a little
restrictive. Uh, you could have
someone that goes hunting every
year, and now suddenly they
would not be eligible for this
position if they think of
fishing, uh, you know, a couple
of years ago.
Um, so still sort of being
discussed.
Um
still working on that.
Um
One of the big changes we, we
did pass a commission reform
bill on bipartisan basis a
couple of years ago, Governor
Pocket vetoed that one of the
big changes between that bill
and this proposal is that
instead of having the commission
members appointed by uh
different elected officials, so
we what we tried to do to
depoliticize the commission was
spread out the uh appointments
and instead of doing that, what
we've taken the approach of um
Uh nominating committee.
So this is something that we see
with judges, something we see
with regents will form a
committee. The committee will
make a list, send a list to the
governor. The governor will be
required to choose from the
list.
Uh, and that's a way that I, I,
we think we can sort of
depoliticize the process and
also ensure that we have
qualified people being
appointed, and then once
appointed, um, there are two
ways to uh remove a
commissioner. One is automatic.
Uh, that if the, uh, no longer
meet the qualifications, um, so
they move out of state, they
would no longer meet the
qualifications or uh, you know,
if they simply resign or pass
away, that that'd be sort of
automatic removal, uh, and then
there you would repeat the
process of reappointing them.
Um, and then there's also a
removal for cause provision and
this again is modeled after um
the the regents, um, and I think
we include the version of this
in the Airstate stream
Commission Bill.
And, and so what has happened in
the past is every time we get a
new governor, we get a new
commission.
Because they all serve uh at the
at the pleasure of the governor.
So this is only removal for
cause, uh, and we've included
the state ethics Commission as
the body to evaluate that, not
to do the removal, but you would
be able to file a complaint with
the state ethics commission, if
you had knowledge of um uh
incompetence, neglected duty or
malfeasance in office, uh, they
could evaluate that complaint if
they found it to have merit, uh,
they could.
that to the Mexico Supreme Court
and the Supreme Court would have
final say on any removal.
And then the, the terms of the
commissioners are staggered, uh,
and there's language in here to
keep the stagger, um, so that,
again, when we get a new
governor, um, you know, new
appointments would be made as
positions became vacant, not
just the whole commission all at
once.
Um, in this draft, we've added
some advisory members.
Uh, to round out the commission
and those include uh outdoor
recreation department that
commissioner of Public lands,
and Secretary of Indian Affairs,
all those individuals, uh, or
their designees as not voting
advisory members to the
commission, and that's the goal
of that is to.
Increased communication between
the commission department and
these other state agencies that
have an interest.
Um, in, in what they are doing.
Nominating committee itself is,
I believe it's 7 members.
Um, it's 4 appointed by elected
officials.
Sa protem sent minority leader,
uh, Speaker of the House, uh,
House Minority Leader, uh, to ex
officio members, uh, uh, the
relevant department heads at UNM
in Mexico State.
Uh, for sort of wildlife related
subjects and then a tribal
member appointed by the
governor.
Um, there's a process laid out
for picking appointments or, or
coming up with the list uh that
would be a public process and
submitting that to the governor.
There's some discussion about
If, if a governor simply makes
simply doesn't make an
appointment, would there be a
fallback position, you know,
could the, could the sitting uh
commissioner select from the
list if the governor doesn't,
after 90 days or something like
that, um, still sort of talking
about that.
Um, 11 tricky issue that has
come up, uh, that the department
flagged his uh wildlife nuisance
laws, the Jennings Act.
Um, they're concerned that
expanding the authority of the
department and the commission uh
to protect additional species
will expand the obligation to
respond to nuisance wildlife
complaints, and we're not trying
to expand that, um, you know,
we're still sort of working on
language, um, to address that.
Uh, and leave it up to the
discretion of the commission,
uh, the language you see on page
13, starting at line 11, that's
language from the, the Jennings
Act, um, uh, we're still working
on that, that that might undergo
a further revision.
Uh, and we have sought input
from the department on all of
this, including uh that language
in particular.
Uh, the
And then the, the third part, I
think is just the funding, and
as I said, um.
Uh, we, we absolutely believe it
should include
Uh, a general fund commitment
from the state of New Mexico,
uh, and that's, and we're
working on that, that's not in
this bill, uh, and, uh, you
know, we've all seen bills that
include an appropriation and can
maybe pass the policy um.
Um, committee and then get stuck
in appropriations because
they're not in the budget. Uh,
so instead of doing that, you
know, I'm fortunate to have
Chairman Small as a co-sponsor,
uh, and he's working on, um,
Ensuring that the money is in
the um
Uh, in the budget. Um, I want to
point out there's a, there's a
significant ad today in the New
Mexican, um, state leaders, we
need a 21st century wildlife
management system and the, the
list of groups who are behind
this ad, um, is sort of a
coalition within the broader
group that's working on this
bill. So this
By all means, does not include
everyone who has been at the
table. Uh, the governor,
Governor's office to their
credit, uh, has convened
stakeholders. Uh, we've had
meetings in the cabinet, uh,
room, uh, that are packed,
right? So we have every seat at
the table is taken and then we
have people sitting in back in
the chairs around the room. Um,
so there's been great dialogue,
um, as I said, it's not over,
um, and I'm still, you know, re
ive to uh suggestions that I
think, you know, improve the
bill and we really are trying to
work uh with all the different
stakeholders.
Um, and with that, I'd be happy
to answer any questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. We're
gonna start down at this end and
just go right around. Senator
Campos we'll start with you if
you have anything.
Uh, Madam Chair, and of course,
uh, presenter, uh, Mr. Chairman,
I, I don't have any questions
right now, but again, as I
indicated yesterday, I do want
to uh work with you as we, we go
through this process. So those
will be my comments today. Thank
you.
So, I, I really appreciate that,
you know, given your history
with this agency.
Thank you very much, Senator
Lopez.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Representative. Um, just to
throw out at this point uh for
membership on the on the
commission. um, I know you have
7, of course, numbers.
I'm sure a flexible maybe, and
the reason why I mentioned that
Madam chair is maybe to consider
um a member from the land grant
community.
And Madam Chair, on the land
grant.
Interim committee meetings over
the years, we've heard some
issues and concerns come up.
Um, with regards to the um
licenses and such that are
Handed out sometimes, um, and I
know we've heard that constantly
over and over, madam chair, so I
would ask for, you know, you'd
consider maybe adding a member
from the land grant community as
well as maybe the Aseos.
Um, and a sekis are not just
northern New Mexico, Asecas are
across the state of New Mexico,
um, over 700 that we have, so
it's not just looking at
northern New Mexico, but, um,
Madam Chair, just for
consideration, maybe upping your
number from 7 to 9 on the
commission.
And there's also, you know, the
land grant council and others
that do have um opportunities to
vet, um, maybe an appointee or
in some way, madam chair for you
to, you know, for your
consideration.
Thank you. Um,
Sheriff Senator, thank you for
that. Um, uh, I, I think that's
an interesting suggestion. The
number is kept at 7, the current
commission at 7, so we were
trying not to increase it.
Um, I, I will say you're, you're
comment made me think about
something else.
One of the concerns that I've
heard in the past and working on
this bill is, for example,
there's a, you know, a, a seat
set aside for hunters and
anglers.
And people say, you know, like,
what do you mean only one? Like,
why is there only one?
And the answer is, in the
current legislation, there are
0.
You know, and what we're sitting
here is a minimum.
And, you know, my expectation is
we would have lots of hunters
and anglers on this commission,
as we always have, you know,
that's, that's really not a
concern for, for me, and people
who meet the qualifications can
certainly, you know, they could,
they could be one of the
position appointments, you could
be a land grant member and, and
have had a hunting license for
the past 4 years or or be a
member of a conservation
organization, you know, and, and
you get to sort of feel a dual
role, so that's a possibility,
or there's 3, you know, public
at large.
Um
Positions which are just people
who are knowledgeable about
wildlife issues.
Um, so there's, there are lots
of opportunities to serve.
And we have, we have broken out,
uh, seats that we want to have,
we want to ensure we, we have
that voice. Um, I, I'm, I might
be hesitant to expand it uh
beyond uh the current 7,
of course, uh, Madam Chair
center, as you know, you know,
I've worked with land grant
communities extensively in my
time in the legislature, um, and
I'll certainly think about that.
So thank you.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair.
Well, this bill when it comes
over to the Senate, um, we'll
make sure we have more of the
conversation too. Thank you.
Thank you, Representative Lujan.
Thank you, madam chair, um,
thank you, Chairman, for
bringing this forward. I think
this is, this is what the
intention is clear, and I
commend you for all the the the
diligent work it took to do
this, um.
And I'm really looking at
section 6, the new section of
the wildlife Conservation Act to
enact.
As red as as it follows here,
um.
I just want to commend you. I,
I'm, I'm reading through it, and
I think that these are these are
updates that are needed. Um, my
one question.
And I'd like to say just for the
record that I would, I, I too
echo what Senator Lopez said and
really engaging with the um
Our land grant communities and
are asse communities and just
get some feedback from them to
see how um.
That advice from um Senator
Lopez um.
Uh
sits with them as well and and
understanding, and I know you
do, so I, I, you're, you're,
this is very um
diligent work. I know you've
been out and I just want to
commend you on it and the
continuation for it, but on, um,
The section, uh, page 18.
The new um pricing.
Um, I just a quick question. How
did you, uh, how did these
pricing?
Uh
Uh, amounts come about, Madam
chair.
Uh, ma'am Cha representative Li
Han, these are the amounts uh
from the prior bill, uh, there
were a couple of changes that we
made, um, but these are, um,
amounts that the department
worked on for the bill that they
viewed as their bill, um, they
have not worked on these
amounts, um,
Even though we, we took them
from Senator Campos's bill and
made a few changes.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um,
That's at work here and
You know, I'll take a deeper
dive as well, but, um, all in
all, I think these are just um.
These are great, uh, suggestions
and updates. I think that.
Our commission or um
Our commission is is due for an
upgrade, and, and I think that's
what you're doing and that's the
intention of this and really
being thoughtful about it, um,
and you mentioned that, uh,
Representative Nathan Small had
an intricate uh um amount of
work on this, who, who, if you
don't mind me asking like, um.
Yeah
Uh, with this new iteration, um.
How long have you been working
on this, Mr. Chair.
Um
Uh, Ma'am chair robes and Wuhan,
uh.
To go back to your other
question on the fees, I should
note that they haven't been
updated in 20 years, they're set
in statutes, so.
They immediately, you know, with
inflation, um, they sort get
with all away. So not only have
they not been updated in 20
years, but we, um,
Uh, we added the CPI adjuster.
So in the future, you know,
they, they will keep pace with
inflation. Uh, as far as how
long I've been working on it,
um, you know, I started with the
commission bill.
Um
It was under Governor Martinez,
it's been a while. That's what I
thought. Um, so great work, um,
I'm enjoying what I'm reading
already, so thank you, continue.
Madam Chair,
representative, I, you know, I
honestly think, you know, this
bill's better. Uh, I mean, I've
been working on it for a while,
but like I, I, I forget who
suggested the nominating
committee, but I think that's a
good, that's a good um um
approach. Uh, when I, when we
did pass the bill that had
appointments from.
different legislative leaders,
but I realized was,
I wasn't, I was changing the
politics more so than taking the
politics out of the process. We
were still having appointments
from
Exclusively from political
people.
Um, and, uh, you know, I, over
in the Senate and Senate rules
and, you know, talking about
like who got to make the
appointments, it, it was clear
to me that there was still gonna
be a highly political process,
and I really think the
nominating commission, um, uh,
provides some insulation there.
So I really like that evolution.
Great, thank you. Thank you,
Representative Representative
Herrera.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, Chair, for bringing
this bill forward. I
I to have waited for this
legislation to come forward, uh,
you know, the.
Fish and Game commission, we do
a lot of talking, but it seems
like nothing ever changes, and I
do think we need to a new form
of of government, uh, and to
expand uh kind of the the uh the
arc of the um of the work, uh,
so that it really we fix the
needs of New Mexico, having
Having said that, I, I just
wanna issue a cautionary tale
because, and I'm disagreeing
with some of my uh fellow
colleagues here on really
appointing like a
conservationist or a hunter or
fisher, you know, I, years ago
when the value caldera uh had
their first board. Uh, it was
established by Congress, and
they had those definitions, and
what happened was that board
came together and they all
thought that they had to
represent.
Boy, if you're a
conservationist, you had to do
that, you, and if you were a
hunter, that board got stuck.
They, they, the only reason I
know this is cause I was asked
to to consider taking over as
the executive director because
they were driving the staff
nuts, uh, because they can never
make a decision, and I said, no,
I don't, I don't want to go
anywhere near that board, um,
but they got stuck because they
each thought they had a
political cause that they had to
represent, so I would, I would
suggest you just get good people
to serve and they
You know, they could have some
of those backgrounds, but when
you designate it, then they
think they have.
As a board member, they have to
come in and represent a
position, and I think that sets
up a dangerous for. So, uh,
again, it's just a cautionary
tale, and um I know people
really struggle with who should
be representing on this board,
and I just, I just think you get
really good people.
And um and they could have
different backgrounds, of
course, they will.
Uh, but to give him a title, I,
I think is dangerous. That's it.
Thank you.
Everybody.
Thank you, Representative
Ferrari. Thank you, Madam Chair,
and um uh and your queen.
McQueen, I'm sorry, um, on your
definition of wildlife, um, you
say a non-domestic mammal, just
to be sure this does not include
wild horses.
Um, ma'am, chairs and furry, can
you give me a um page 17 and
lying 12. Um, uh,
for, it does not include uh them
by statue now.
Um, it does.
Uh, there's some discretion
given to the game commission,
uh, on terms of what animals
they feel need protection. Uh,
I'm confident that they don't
want to get involved.
Uh, with free roaming horses,
um, so that's, this is not a
doesn't address free roaming
horses one way or another.
I will have another bill on
that.
Oh, OK, well, it will have to
look at that, um, but I'm really
glad that um we're able to
expand um the good work of, um,
and the renaming of the
wildlife um commission. I think
it's really important and um
Also, since New Mexico is the
4th, um,
Most diverse biodiverse state
and most New Mexicans really
support um
The state's investing more in
habitat protection as a means of
even protecting a clean air and
water and our way of life. I
think this is a really good,
good measure. Thank you for
bringing it forward. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Woods.
Well, thank you, Madam Chair.
I appreciate the opportunity to
comment today.
I'm just going to keep it real
brief. I, I do not agree with
expanding the policy of
Of the
All the species, I believe this
agency was set up.
To, to look after the game
animals in the state. I believe
the hunters and ranchers, uh,
the hunters and, and
Fishermen in the state, uh, pay
the fees for this. It's a, a
self-contained, uh, agency and
It's working.
Pretty good. I, I admit that,
uh, they've had time in the past
to real problems in the past,
filling their commission.
And uh
We, we could look at that part
of it, but just to expand the,
the, you know, the species of,
of greatest concern is a concern
to me.
We have the Federal Wildlife
Service that, that designates a
lot of species and the
environmental Protection Agency
that
polices the uh endangered
species.
And
I don't see
The rest of it, but uh that's my
comments if you want to comment,
that'd be fine, sir. Senator,
what, uh, Madam Chair, Senator
Woods, I appreciate that. I
would simply point out that
The department already does a
lot of this.
In fact, at times they've told
us we don't need to update the
name and the mission because
it's already covered under the
wildlife Conservation Act, so
the department is responsible
for species of greatest
conservation need, that is
separate and apart from federal
endangered or threatened
listing, um, they're actively
involved in that, uh, when there
are, um,
When there are wildlife issues,
and this is I talked to one of
the stakeholders and, and I, I
put it like this.
When there are wildlife issues
in New Mexico.
This is the agency we want at
the table.
So, for example, wolves, I mean,
wolves are controversial, um,
species, but that's where our
expertise is, is in this agency.
We don't have anyone else to
send to those meetings.
Um, other, you know, threats and
endangered species, you know,
again federal listing, the whole
state wildlife action plan.
That's done by this agency, and
it covers all these other
species already. So in a way, I,
I, I think what I'm doing is
formalizing.
Um, what, uh, their mission has
already grown to be in terms of
addressing non-game species and
the department will tell you
they spent a lot of time on
non-game species.
Thank you, Senator Wirth.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair and
thank you.
Chair McQueen for your continued
efforts. I can relate to what
you are going through. It took 8
years, and you are helpful, uh,
on the interstate stream
commission bill, which was first
introduced in 2015, vetoed once
by Governor Martinez, vetoed in
2019 by Governor Lujan Grisham,
uh, finally signed in 2023. Uh,
so it's challenging because
you're asking the executive to
take away some of their
authority.
Uh, the reality though is that
these agencies, I was dealing
with water and water policy,
you're dealing with game and,
and animal policy. If you don't
balance out these boards, you
have wild pendulum swings in how
our water's managed, how our
animals are managed. So I, and I
think that's an argument that
can be convincing to an
executive. I know I had those
discussions with Governor Lujan
Grisham, um,
And to find that sweet spot, and
I think this is the year you
need to get this done, cause
I'll tell you it's really hard
to get down on the front end of
an administration, and I know
one thing right out of the gate
is the effective dates on page
25. This bill doesn't kick in
really till the end of this
administration, which is the
same thing we did with
Interstate Stream commission, so
that's an important step. Um,
and I also know you've been
working with the governor on
this, and I just really
encourage you to
Continue to do that.
So we can try and get something
over the finish line. Uh, it's,
this is one of those, and I went
through this with you were
co-sponsor on the interstate re,
you can't let perfection be the
enemy of the good when it comes
to something like this. It's
just that hard, uh, to get
across the line. So a couple of
things that jumped out at me,
um, one, I want to talk about
the term, cause you've got a
6-year term and a nominating
commission, which is interesting
cause that's the format we used
on the PRC which was new 6
years.
staggered terms with a
nominating commission, and I, I
can see that argument and I
think Governor Lujan Grisham
signed those 6-year terms with a
nominating commission, so I
think that's certainly something
that's there. I also though, can
see, you know, the, the benefit
of a four-year term so that you
don't have
folks locked in.
For such a long time, so I
wanted, and you can maybe
address what the thinking is on
6 versus 4. We did Interstate
stream commission as a four-year
term.
So, um, Madam Chair, senator,
just to clarify, there's the
wildlife commission, and there's
the Wildlife Commission
nominating committee.
So the commission of the
wildlife commission, you were
saying the nominating.
commission.
Just a little of each. The, the
commission has 6-year terms
staggered. The nominating
committee.
Actually doesn't have terms.
And it's, it's
They serve at the pleasure of
whoever put them on the
committee, uh, so they serve
until they're removed by that
person or they resign and for
example, if uh we got a new
Speaker of the House.
The new Speaker of the House
could, but their guy, so I
guess, yeah, I was confused. I'm
talking about what are the terms
for the commissioners. The
commission, the commission
itself are six-year terms, yes,
and that was just, um, you know,
we were looking at the stagger
and that, uh, 6-year term seemed
to seem to work well.
But, yeah, I, I understand your
point. So that's just one.
Second thing I'll flag is the
removal process. I'm not a big
fan of putting the ethics
commission.
In the middle of this, we
already have a process that we
used with Interstate stream
commission that involves the
Supreme Court, and that's what
we use now for regents. If
there's and it's, and I've
looked at the constitutional
language.
You know, it's exactly what you
have in your bill, members of
the board, this is out of the
current constitutional language
it's, it's uh.
Article 12 section 13.
And it specifically says members
of the board shall not be
removed except for incompetence,
neglect of duty, or malfeasance
in office. And then it's got the
Supreme Court with a rulemaking
process to do that. I mean, the
difference here is that, again,
you're taking the governor out
as I understand it here.
And I, you know, that's
something you're gonna have to
talk.
And think that through, but I
just think that using the
current process versus creating
a new
Process with the ethics
commission, I'm much more
comfortable and, and again,
that's what we did in the
interstate stream bills use the
existing process. So, so the
question, Madam Chair, Senator,
the question that came up with
it, with that language, which
was the language in the prior
bill was who could bring a
removal action.
And it wasn't really clear, and
I asked that question, um, the
council service a couple of
times and it just, it just
wasn't really clear and in some
other states, you know, we've
looked at what other states are
doing, um, and first off, almost
all Western seeds have a
wildlife agency, you know,
they've they've all moved beyond
game and fish, um, with maybe
one or two exceptions, including
us. Um, but in some states where
there is a removal process,
there
been, you know, essentially
nuisance removal actions, if
anyone can institute it, and
that language is silent as to
who can institute it. And, you
know, if it's just the governor,
well, you know, the governor's
made these appointments. Uh, the
last draft of this had it.
As the Attorney general.
And you know, the attorney
General, of course, is an
elected official, so there's
some concern about that. Some
attorney generals get along very
well with the governor and some
attorney generals don't like,
could those politics come into
play?
And then uh the governor's
office itself actually pointed
out that the Attorney General's
office provides an attorney to
advise the commission.
And so that created a potential
conflict of interest by having
the attorney General's office
being the entity who could
institute a removal action. And
so we
Try the, the ethics commission,
and I've talked to that uh
director of the ethics
commission and uh he thinks this
is inappropriate role for that
commission and the idea would be
a complaint would be filed with
them. They would evaluate the
merits that they can't complain.
Uh, so it's sort of a screening
process, and if they felt it had
merit, then they go to the
Supreme Court.
Yeah, I'm sure I just I'm
concerned though that the
complaint can be brought by any
person uh who has knowledge of
the commissioner's alleged
incompetence, neglect or duty or
malfeasance.
Uh, I mean, again, what's gonna
happen is you're gonna have the,
the political pendulum, again,
is not going to be taken over by
all the advocates on either
side, we're going to be filing
these things potentially, and it
just seems to me that
We've done this with regions,
we've done it. Interstate stream
commission, it was the governor
who has the ability to remove a
commissioner for failure to
attend 3 consecutive meetings or
for other cause in the same
manner as provided for removal
of border regions. So again, we
just use the Constitution. Think
about that again, that's just
one of those issues that's out
there.
I just, you know, there's a lot
in this bill and as Senator
Woods said, it does a lot of
different things. I think I was
one of the few people who voted
against the fee increase because
I'm not a big fan of
Agencies being funded with fees,
and I really appreciate you're
doing some general fund
transition. I think that's the
direction we need to go, so we
don't make.
Hunting and fishing, you know,
an elite.
Subc category of, of, of
activity for those that can
afford to pay the, the fees, and
again, we're not there, but I
just worry about that. But
again, that's part of
The overall compromise to get
this done, and I just
Let's try and get this and make
it happen. So I really
encouraged and I'm, and I'm
Delighted that you're working
hand in hand with the
administration, cause I think
that's the way we're going to
get this across the line.
Versus getting into vetoes and
fights and all of that stuff.
Uh, it just feels like we, we're
at that point where we can get
this done and we need to.
So that's what I have in my
chair, thank you.
Thank you very much,
Representative Kadena.
Thank you. And Mr. Chair, thank
you for working on this. Uh, I
know it's been many years, and I
hope you will take everybody's
comments into consideration.
And thank you.
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you
committee.
Uh, committee members were
running
ahead of time, uh, we do have
lunch provided today. It will be
by trout unlimited and Sierra
Club, probably Sara at noon. It
should be here a little bit
before that, and we're set to go
back, Mr. Chair, at 12:45. Do we
want to start any earlier or
just 12:45?
Uh, man, because we've scheduled
people and people might be
tuning in online, I'd like to
stick to the schedule as
published. OK, so 12:45, uh, we
will be back to start
