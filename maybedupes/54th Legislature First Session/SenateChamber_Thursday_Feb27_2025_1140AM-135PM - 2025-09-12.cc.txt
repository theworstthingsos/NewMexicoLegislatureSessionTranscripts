will they have to answer to, Mr.

Mr. President, the public

Senator Ramos, you have the
floor.
Mr. President, that position
works with PED trying to make
sure these two agencies will
so this one position will help
ECECD with that special ed
population, but they still will
answer to PED. We haven't really
correctly with the position with

Doctor Cage because I know quite
a few that had said they did if
they received noncompliance
OK.
Mr. President, Senator, thank
you for that. Uh, I've got some
schools that are, uh,
disagreeing on that, but it'll
take me to my next question, Mr.
treat the, the schools just in
the opposite manner, Mr.
President, Senator.
Ben Stewart, Mr. President, of
course not.
until the school proves that
they are doing it right. Is
there anything in the bill,
Madam Protem, that would give me
some comfort in this or any
I think that you should have a
meeting with Doctor Cage to get
the answers to these because
it's, it's not in this bill.
Senator guy goes, Mr. President,
Senator, I'll take your advice
answered as this bill goes
forward. Thank you, Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Senator Galgos.
Senator Woods.
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.
Um,
Uh, if the sponsor would yield,
Uh, I noticed on the financial
impact report here that
That it's talking about.
Essentially a total of 9
And then it's got a
IEP system for 4 million.
Right now this system, this is
essentially done by executive
order, isn't that right, Mr.
President, and, and Senator.
Margaret Cage all the way from
Louisiana, where they're
celebrating Mardi Gras and so is
she, uh, she's been here a year
and a half and uh we are happy
Well, it, it, but that's kind of
my question goes into that.
We're gonna start putting this
office, this bill puts this
governor. It's in the office of
the Public Education Department.
But it's it's own division with
its own deputy secretary.
Senator Woods
Special education, right, Mr.
President. Senator Mr.
President, yes, that's correct.
OK, so the budget.
Is it in House Bill 2 right now.
And, and if it is to what extent
is it in there, Mr. President
and Senator?
Fiscal impact study.
is saying 9.
Anyway, there's a little
discrepancy there. I don't need
any more questions about it. Um.
So
Essentially.
We're talking about trying to
appropriate level is in my
hearing that right, Mr.
President. Is that, is that what
we're doing?
Explain
The reason
need to teach to.
Just a small explanation. I
don't need a whole long
explanation time is my life is
short.
So Mr. President.
So, you know, we, we've always
had special education as part of
the PED, uh, this setting up an
office kind of elevates it. Uh,
Uh, we have these transition
times that are really important,
pre-K to K.
Elementary, middle, middle to
high, and high to career, and
have projects and programs and
training and help special ed
teachers with those kind of
transitions. In addition, we've
had issues with our IEPs which
available for districts to work
on that will be short enough to
get the information out so
special students arrive in the
special education after
an A level class where I went in
to school into classrooms and
helped kids. I had a B level

my classroom to learn how to

range of disabled kids and so we
have to teach according to that
and we have to follow the
we're a little worried about
that. Woods,
um, Mr. President, I too am
worried about federal funding
right now.
Uh, but what I'm
I guess I'm worried that
You know, we're just expanding
government and not
I have a little bit of
Trouble figuring out the money
related to the goal related to
what we're doing right now and
what we're going to do in the
Townsend.
Thank you, Mr. President. I was
gonna ask, um, I think this is a
fantastic bill and I'm so um I'm
the, what is, what is the impact
on this bill if we do lose
federal funds and it was alluded
to, um, I know that the
governor, Mr. President, is
talking about having to have a
Senator Stewart yield. I'm happy
to yield, Mr. President, but I,
I don't have any more answers
than anybody else does. We're
all worried about it. We're just
mechanisms to ensure that, you
know, if the worst comes to
worst and we are cut funding
from the federal government that
we will have some funding to
rely on.
Senator Townsend.
Thank you, Mr. President, with
the gentle lady yield for a
question.
Yes.
About 90% of the superintendents
are opposing this piece of
legislation.
And I would, I would like for
you to comment on that and I
make it, uh, work in the
schools, uh, Mr. President, um,
gentle lady, if you would.
Stewart, Mr. President, I think
uh some of them have backed away
colleagues in the education
committees. Um, so, you know, I,
we all get a little hot under
the collar occasionally. I think
that happened to her and they
bill and those districts know it
and they need these services. I
mean, imagine having an IEP that
works for you, your special ed
kids in every district.
special ed. It's been issues
year after year, uh, so, you
know, I believe that this is an
important bill, and I think they
are coming around to it.
President, if we really are
worried about federal funding.
As many of us are.
Worried about federal funding.
Maybe it would behoove us to
slow down on spending money for
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.
We sponsor yield for a couple of
questions.
Yes, I will.
Yeah
Believe that some 90% of the
school superintendents or
standing in opposition to this
piece of legislation.
And I'm curious as to why
have too many bosses, uh, coming
from Santa Fe. Could you flesh
out a little bit what the source
of those objections were, if you
Uh, I, I think, uh, the governor
sort of insulted the educators
in both the Senate committee and
the House Committee. I think
was just one person, not 90% of
them. Uh, so I think they've
calmed down. They were trying to
support the education
committees, um, they stood up
and said,
now calmed down, um, and we've
made amendments, you know, we
made every amendment that was
asked for, um, by the schools,
um, so, um.
how to teach structured literacy
and to do other things they need
to help with transitions. They
need help with thy EPs. They
That's what this bill will help.
Thank you Senator Stewart.
Senator Scott.
So Mr. President, I, I believe
But I believe I've got some
information that
Their opposition predates any
comments that the government,
uh, the governor might have had.
Uh,
is there an unthought, what
would be the source of any
discomfort that might be
occurring with the
I mean, I know that we tried a
bill last year and they didn't
like it.
We've worked with them. We've
Thank you, Senator Scott.
Mr. President and Senator, it
might surprise you. Education is
not my space.
But
I do listen.
educators and for the most part
know what they're doing, so.
In the circumstance where they
overcome before I can support
this legislation. Thank you, Mr.
President. Senator. We have
Senator Charlie.
child. They're actually in the
gifted and talented program and
have had an IEP since elementary
school, um, and in my child's
high school journey, they've
been to 3 high schools and
so I really appreciate the
intention of this legislation
because it helps parents support
the child that they have at
every single one of these high
needed and oftentimes in those
meetings that I've had with IEP
professionals.
Um,
it feels like I'm asking for
indulgences for my child. And,
and so I know that through
experience with my little one.
Mr. President, thank you. Thank
you, Charlie. Senator Gonzalez.
Thank you, uh, Mr. President,
and I don't need to, uh,
It's a very
It's a type of very um
You have to be very careful in
technical assistance that I
could, and one of the reasons is
so you're dealing with some very
delicate manners and all of.
um.
Special ed itself.
Can get very expensive on the
district, you know, when things
don't go right.
So having an office and having
more support and having more
staff in having that.
Ability to confine in an office
why any superintendent would
oppose this. This is like
You know, a super gift to have
that kind of technical
assistance, you know, for.
this as a very positive, very
positive to our education part.
In our state because uh for many
years, uh, you know, we have had
that support of having an office
to just help you, you know, with
uh any type of situation that
comes up, but again, I just will
support to that family and to
that child. So with that, um.
Uh, Mr. President, members, I
support.
Very, very strongly this piece
of legislation and thanks to our
bill.
Uh, thank you, Mr. President,
and I want to thank the body for
the conversation, you know, I, I
will say that certainly my
superintendent over the last
weeks, none of them brought up
any of these questions, so I
think it's kind of a myth made
by one person on that issue. I
is the way to solve it. So
pleased with Doctor Margaret
Cage. She is really turned that
office around in a short period
of time.
Mr. President, I move that
the affirmative, except those
voting in the negative by a show
of hands to your seats we are
voting all senators to your
seats.
If you wish to vote no, please
raise your hand.
Senator Scott voting no.
Senator Townsend voting no.
Senator voting no.
Mayor Paul voting now.
Senate. We're on to item 5 on
today's calendar that Senate
Finance Committee substitute for
Senate Bill 115 with the
emergency clause and I'll yie to
Senator Padilla.
Uh, thank you very much, Mr.
on final passage has been taken
and that is now subject to
debate, amendment or
substitution.
Sinner Padilla to explain the
bill.
Uh, thank you very much, Mr.
President, uh, in my capacity as
vetting and that the legislature
is a part of them and so that's
essentially what this piece of
legislation is it authorizes the
New Mexico Finance Authority to,
uh, provide loans from the
initiatives including land
acquisition, construction
equipment procurement and public
facilities, uh, the key
provisions in legislation are
that we authorize these loans,
uh, that they are from qualified
this legislation, why we would
need to do this is because these
are major infrastructure
development projects, uh, the
economic stimulus that it
provides to the various
areas where these projects are
done and the flexibility uh for
this is a normal process. I just
want to reassure everybody, um,
the applications open in the
October time frame, and they
accept applications all the way
up to, well, right before I
President, uh, in every nook and
cranny you can imagine, and so
that's essentially what the
legislation does. Thank you
Thank you Senator Padilla.
Senators, we're debating.
Senator Brand

bill?
Uh, yes, Mr. President, I'll
were part of the amendment, Mr.
President, that was added on in

And it says it on all of them,

put in.
these projects so that it's a
catch-all for each one
individually. Uh thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I just want everyone
to, to understand that because I
didn't.
Understand that that I thought
Approve whatever project they
want, is that correct?
Senator Padilla, uh, Mr.
President, that's that's one way
to look at it, sure. Another way
Senator Brant, thank you, Mr.
Chairman, um, kind of.
Because there's, there's like,
um, on the first page in section
one, it says if it's under a
Center, Mr. President, that'd be
correct.
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.
Senator, I, I, I just, again,
you know, I, I in the past.
I've been here for 13 years and
And the problem I have with us
not seeing those projects is I
have no idea if there's any
projects being done in my
community or if they're all
going to Albuquerque, or if
they're all going to
projects and uh so I just want
everyone to be aware of that.
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank
you, Senator Brandt.
See no further debate.

bill.

sure these projects are fully
vetted and reviewed by the uh
New Mexico Finance Authority,
and with that, Mr. President, I
move that uh Senate Finance
Committee substitute for Senate

Thank you. Before I take the,
the vote, I want to make sure to
go to Senator Woods, if there's
any.

clause, Senator Padilla, uh,
thank you very much, Mr.
President and members of the
body. We're going on to the next
item in the calendar, that's
Senate Bill 283 on final passage
has been taken and that it is
now subject to debate amendment
or substitution. no objection.
So, uh, Senator Berlins if you,
Thank you, Mr. President. Senate
Bill 283 is a necessary bill to
ensure that children in CYFD
custody received the federal
benefits that they may qualify
for.
foster care system are currently
receiving federal benefits, and
that may be Social Security
benefits, uh, uh, there's a
number of a number of federal
benefits, death benefits, uh, it
To absorb those benefits instead
of keeping those for the child.
In 2023, the legislator became
aware of this, and also the
custody to create a trust in the
name of that child, and then
when they have turned of age to
provide financial literacy when
the child leaves our state
custody and then provide an
Thank you, Mr. President. I
thank my co-sponsors, uh,
and Lopez.
Mr. President, I stand in strong
support of this bill. I remember
when we became aware of that. I,
it was, I think in an
and so these kids are currently
doing it. I really commend the
sponsors for putting it into
statute because you never know
who's going to be the secretary
at any given time, and I think
you, madam, uh, Mr.
President.
Seeing no further debate, uh, we
do have debate. I apologize. We
have Senator Block.
accountable and it's not going
to who it's supposed to go to,
which is the children here that
have been completely hurt
losing, uh, potentially 10s of
fix this because I actually, Mr.
President, I would like to ask,
um,
Uh, if Senator Duhague would
yield
for a question.
That would remedy any back pay
and benefits to any of the
children.
That for years did not get the
Mr. President, no, because up
until now it has been lawful for
them to use these funds to help
pay for the care of these
children. In fact, a ton of most
guidance saying hey states, stop
doing this, uh, preserve these
funds for the benefit of the
children they're intended for,
uh, and so, so this wouldn't fix
shame, by the way, it's a shame
that, uh, these children, these
young New Mexicans who needed
this money, this benefit, these
benefits will not be able to get
consent, and I appreciate CYFD
as well working with us on this.
And again, lastly, Mr.
President, thank you to the
sponsors to correct.
This egregious policy that the
President, and yes, I, I am very
strongly in support of this
legislation. I think this is a
move in the right direction. I
think this codifies it. There's
just gonna be no confusion going
forward on how these benefits
Thank you, Mr. President. uh,
Mr. President, may I ask, boy, I
don't know which one of the
three of you to yield, uh,
Senator Doug and colleagues, I
remember all of this very well.
This all took place in Riodos so
really we had an interim
committee meeting and uh Senator
Ivy Soto at the time raised the
issue with the secretary who was
voluntarily by the agency, but
I've got to tell you in the
course of this bill and our
hearings, I, I've heard some,
uh, representation, this is
still going on, and I see
to children for maybe a lost
parent and, and CYFD is using
those funds, um.
And, and so, uh, the secretary
said she would get to the bottom
of it and stop it, and, uh,
Yeah, that's, that's appalling.
I think we would all recognize
and I, I think to Senator
Block's point, uh, I don't need
you to yield anymore, but
lot of times he will tell me I
can't do something and I managed
to do it. Um, I, I really do,
and it wouldn't be surprised if
there's not an effort to recover
them uh, uh, an opportunity, uh,
scholar for kids to be uh living
off Social Security benefits
that are paid to kids and I, and
I got to tell members, if
you're, if you're a lawyer and
Senator Doug and I, if I did
are supposed to be directed.
to a child, which is frankly why
we go through a very tortured
process when there's a child and
benefits being paid to a child,
we get guardian headlights, uh,
parents to have access to that
money because there are cases
where the parents will spend
that money down and by the time
the child reaches an age of
majority, the money's gone, um,
and so I I hope that we will
Social Security benefits that
should have gone to those kids.
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank
you, Senator.
Thank you, Senator Cervantesino

Um
If that bill goes all the way
through and becomes law.
Wouldn't that put this under the

utility. So right now we have
water utilities, which don't
fall under whatever we did
yesterday. We have sewer

as a utility, therefore, it can
be dealt with. Mr. President,
uh, Senator, I I appreciate.
our ditches and and akass and
all those things and and you
know the storm water runs in
rear Rancho very rarely.
But it runs down those arroyos.
And so what's the difference
between the Arroyos and the
storm water that you're talking
about.
So Mr. President, this is.

I just, uh, I'm thinking that
they're.

unanimous consent of the Senate
that the records show that all

this is a holdover from when

back to our state constitution,
just to make sure that we didn't
inadvertently vote for governor
or secretary of state or any
other thing.
that we weren't authorized to

election. So right now they
cannot do a bond election during
a general election because it's

stand in support, uh, being the
only member in here still on the

that latitude.

lot of opportunity. Thank you.

I'm not I can't explain that to
you. I apologize. No thank you,
Mr. President. If I can recall,
this was locked into our
constitution so deep.
That in order to remove it, it
reach that threshold, but I
think a percentage point. There
were some great lawyering and
some great uh reasoning by the
Supreme Court that then deemed
it unconstitutional as it

sexism this this uh
constitutional amendment was or
put in the Constitution before,
uh, before, uh.

tighter, um, but is this set to
be placed on the general

what our new elections are
called, but they're referred to
as regular elections nothing
