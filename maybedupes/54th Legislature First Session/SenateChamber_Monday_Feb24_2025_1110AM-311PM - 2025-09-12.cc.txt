you call it, but you touch a

And, uh, so now the oil and gas

next big mantra.

actual industries that have done

That would be really, really,

So these 3 cars our colleges of

And if anybody wants to really
get into the weeds on the
science of reading. There's a
great podcast called Soul A
down the wrong path, sold us a
story, and our kids are not
learning to read. I should tell
you that 40 other states are in
the process of doing what we're
doing. There are some states

So how it works is that, uh, the
colleges of education would have

I'm, I'm dragging up some old
cobwebs back here, but it seems
like we allow textbook change on

So I might ask the sponsor of
the amendment if he knows
anything about a rotation to a

I will.
having diversity up there. um,
Mr. President, um,
I was trying to follow all of
the changes in the amendment,
and there's some things on the
to do and the reason I ask is
I've gotten a lot of information
about how um.
The
concern about this approach for
bilingual and multi uh for
from teachers who say we need
flexibility in in addressing
what the children's needs are
and so I'm trying to understand
the amendment to see if I um if

don't understand all of the
things that the amendment is
trying to do.

And both have been proven
through the work of the National

Thank you, Senator Boone.
Senator Celia Lopez, you still
I think local choice and
flexibility in the classroom in
terms of methodology to address
the child where the child is at,
uh, my children were at
did not. And then my, by the
time my 3rd child was there,
they were in a whole new
different um.
Different approach to reading
and what I gathered from that is
there needs to be flexibility. I
for me. Um, however, those kids
are bored if they're just doing
phonetics over and over again,
um, and so I am a little bit,
teachers and local choice, um,
because the amendments very
complex.
So, uh, if the sponsor would
yield and sponsor the amendment
would yield.
OK, Mr. President, all, all
reading instruction course work.
Shall use high quality
So this allows for that to be an
option.
Thank you, Senator Senator C

Mr. President, if, if I, but uh,
again, I'll ask the sponsor to
Senator Boone
Thank you, Mr. President. uh,
Thank you. I think I would be
more supportive of this bill if

flexibility to find students
where they are and teach.

responds to cues easily or
whether the child needs a

on the value of a literature or
any of the uh course material
that we have. Is that how you
did it?

President, senator, as you know,
they are the experts in the
classroom, but Mr. President,
Senator, I just wanted to ask
you another question and could
you give me the
hearing that, uh, your outcomes
in your district on what the
where they were in proportion to
the state, would you reiterate
School in Portalis, which does
use balanced literacy has
received a 42% reading
proficiency rate, which is
higher than the 38% statewide
average.
amendment still allows school
board flexibility, I would have
a hard time understanding why we
wouldn't uh take this amendment
and I will stand in full support
Well, the gentleman, uh, sponsor
of the amendment yield, do you?
Yes, I will.
Is the ability to
Teach.
Children, where they're at.
Have been raised
And in, in the mannerism.
That affects their learning
capacity.
Uh, your amendment strikes the
word philosophy and inserts
thereof the approach.
The ability to be taught.
As their teachers in the
classroom.
think is most appropriate.
Thank you Mr. President. The
answer to the, to your question,
Senator, is yes.
And an approach can be amended
as needed.
think if you go on down, um, on
page 2, line 19.
Um
There
your amendment strikes the word
explicit.
Option that you and I have
discussed as being very
important, addressing the needs
of those children where they're
at.
Then
your uh striking explicit. It
gives that teacher.
In that community.
That knows those children.
The ability to meet that child
where they're at, is that
very, very important.
And um
I have, I've, I've listened to
the introduction of the bill. I
don't see um.

what makes New Mexico is all the
vibrant cultures that we have.

So you said that the Portal

don't remember the name of it
has a 42%.

And Senator, Senator brand, Mr.
The whole language, uh, reading

Mr. President, I
I'm not sure of that.
Thank you Senator Boone,
Cenbrand. Mr.
Same question then, uh, your
balanced literacy, how long have
they been, they've been using
gotten the whole 42%,
I would assume as long as
reading.
Instruction has been going on.
So, Mr. President, Senator, I,
I, I hate to stand up and
But Mr. President, the fact of
the matter is I don't think that
we as a body can be happy with

I don't think we can be
satisfied.

Stewart, um.
On page 6.
Um, if you could just address,
um,
I think part of the concern is
that in in point B.
based reading instruction and
the science of reading shall not
be used to teach reading in
public schools or state agencies
is does that not require that
amended uh to uh put in
post-secondary and administrator
preparation programs. But yes,
if they're just guessing, so,
you know, there's plenty of uh
of balanced literacy materials
that structured literacy does
not preclude like you.
a rulemaking process where some
of this flexibility can be built
in. But we, we don't want people
to continue to teach kids to
states that have used structured
literacy for years.
Hey Senator Stewart, Senator
Brand. Thank you, madam.
We will just go with whatever,
uh.
I'll maybe I'll just say
president. How's that?
we have enough data to put
numbers on it quite yet, uh, as
averages, um, but I think as we
as we see this go into place,
you know, I, I will share a
When, when my oldest son started
school. Now he started in
Oklahoma.
Um, so, you know, a little
backwards there sometimes, but
um, he started in Oklahoma and
and.
We were, uh, my, my wife was
working for the Salvation Army
who ran the Boys and Girls Club

And he gave us this entire

And maybe you, you, us that are
older will remember is called

But we got that program and
All of my kids after that
experience, we taught all my
kids to read at home. We didn't
leave that up to the schools and
we taught them hooked on

It works.

But I guess if they couldn't
then then they could do other
interventions, could they not,
Senator Stewart?
And Stewart.
saying that phonics is only 1/5
of structured literacy.
Comprehension of text is just as
important and developing base
kids actually learn to read. So
it's phonics is
a major part, but as I say, it's
only 1/5.
Hey Sander Stewart, Senator
You know, usually, and, and
Senator Stewart can tell you how
many times I have been up here
pushing local control.
And fighting for local control.
And I usually am the one who'd
billions of dollars every year
in education, and we don't seem
to be moving the dial. Now we
found something that moves the
dial.
Then I think we're gonna have to
start dictating from the state a
little bit more.
And I think this is one of those
areas. This is absolutely
It is critical that our kids.

42% isn't enough.
and then we need and at the same
time we need to be working on
math, so hopefully we'll get
that bill down to the floor, and
we can do that as well. Thank
you, Mr. President.
Thank youinda Brandt, Center

Senator, do our school board
members, are they experts in

Mr. President, no, I wouldn't
say that they are.
Experts in reading proficiency,
but they are.
Elected by their local
communities and.
And, and expected to work with.
Mr. President and Senator Boone,
uh, would you say that school

science of reading.
Mr. President, I, I would say
no. They're, they're, they're
more than likely not, but I, I
do think, I know when I was.

could, but, but, uh, I wouldn't
say I was an expert and I, I
would say that school boards
just aren't.

important as a state if we're
going to move forward similar to

because of the change to

It doesn't appear that there's

Anyone wishing to debate on the

Senator Townsend on the bill.
Mr. President, I, uh, I heard a
while ago in, in commentaries
about Mississippi. I think
Senator Sos brought it up and so
the body to realize that we're
just doing about half of what
Um,
Mississippi did to turn theirs
around. Would you agree with
grade retention that they did.
I've had numerous conversations
with folks here, um, I do
nation rather than 50th. It's
pretty.
shocking, but what I believe is
that if we can do this for 10
years, that might be the time
you for that, Senator Stewart.
Um, the commentary that I saw
would put a lot of
Uh, weight behind their, their,
demonstrated the capacity to be
tested, uh, to, to equip to the
great equivalency. So it seemed
like to me that, um,
Um, your bill successful and
If we're going to rely on
someone's, uh,
Uh, Mr. President, we're, we're
not doing this, uh.
So let, let me figure out how to

what this bill is, is what we
need.

actually teaching kids how to

work on implementing structured

interventions that we need to do

Thank you, Mr. President. Thank
you, uh, Senator Stewart, you
So Mr. Chairman, the 3 queuing
system is what we've been using
through balance literacy,
picture and guess the word. Look
at the first letter, see if you
can think of some word. Look,
think about the sentence and
where the word is in the
sentence. So what kind of word
you actually look at a word and
sound it out once you know the
six syllable types, you can even
decode a multi-syllabic word. I
don't believe anything less than
60 or 70% is good enough. That's
what they're.
getting in other states with
structured literacy.

Mr. President, and I couldn't

So Mr. President, and that's
what I was trying to find before
the
Before we got here, but.
And yet somehow we went
backwards over time.
So
What happened? Why could, why
could we read in 50s, 60s, 70s,
The education community was sold

We were sold a story that
Of course we all want a worm and
fighting classroom.
But that doesn't teach kids how
to learn to read. It teaches
about, about 5% of our students
structured literacy or they
don't learn to read. So what
happened was in the 50s and the
60s. Our teachers were teaching
phonics.
Uh, so it's how, um, our mothers
who are first grade teachers
taught reading, and then we had
this guy out of Arizona named
Ken Goodman, who basically said,
you don't need to do that. You

into their statutes so that
uh, George W. Bush, who did the
No Child Left Behind, a major
part of that was reading first
So that's, that's the story. We
don't like to talk about it,
it's embarrassing. I'm

My concern is that we're making

questions is, where's Pat on
this bill? because I've passed
some legislation and put things
into law and then they make
these rules that don't actually
Uh, Mr. President.
The public education department
brought me this bill.
The public education department
this past year to help about 20
states try to do the science of
reading.
And so this bill came in part
from all of that work with the
Hunt Institute, um,
they've been on a trajectory to
understand and try to implement
structured literacy.
So they're all in and they have
what structured literacy was 6
years ago, and now she's singing
over here whispering my ear with
every air that people are saying
about what's in the bill or
we had to do amendments to
ensure that this is about our
colleges of education, changing
what they're doing. Most people

and and is acquiring language
first what I'm worried about is
that the bilingual education
component isn't strong enough to
to this to this legislation and
then I think Mr. President,
about.
How if you keep doing the same
thing over and over again and
you expect different results
bill that I don't like is the
banning of alternative
approaches which might work for
some, some of the children um
back, but I am assured by
Senator Souls that it will not
hurt the children who find it
easy to read in an effective
teacher's classroom and this
Yeah, like I said, I am bothered
by banning something that people
have been trained in.
Um
that, um, the, the people have
been bringing me the, the
literature to read um about
Language learners.
And how this won't necessarily
I wish I was on education so I
knew this better, but I think
it's important to defer to my
colleagues who've been working
on something as Senator Pope
said for two years, um, and is
also that we don't slow down
some kids. Thank you, Mr.
President. Lopez. Senator Block.
Thank you, Mr. President. Will

ask you this first, how many

Senator Stewart.
I taught elementary mostly

Thank you. Center Block. Thank
you, Mr. President.
Madam Protem, um, let me read
this first and then I'm gonna
tell you who you remind me of.
including the knowledge.
And skills teachers need to
support struggling readers.
And those with dyslexia.
Did you ever identify those
students with dyslexia.
Senator Stewart.
Um, Mr. President, if you could
dyslexia in my classroom, uh,
repeatedly. I had all kinds of
students in my classroom.
Um, I'm mostly taught. I had a
classroom of 5, 1st grade little
boys who wanted to kill each
other and me for a whole year.
So, uh, I've run the gamut and
yes, I've seen students with
dyslexia.
Stewart, Mr. President, while I
was teaching, I did not know as
much as I do now about dyslexia.
The reason I say this is in 2nd
grade.
I was diagnosed with dyslexia
because like I think Senator
my letters and numbers backwards
and I had a 2nd grade teacher
named Mrs. Cody.
At Wilson School in Manchester,
New Hampshire.
The madam Protem reminds me of
my 2nd grade teacher.
In a very good way.
And I appreciate her dedicated
developing specific teacher
preparation standards, uh, to
include dyslexia.
And
I remember being pulled out of
class for several years.
Is, is that still what you know
now as for dyslexia, some of the
specific teacher preparation
standards for that?
Sure, it was a 30 minute
question and I'll go back, uh.
It was related to the dyslexic
students and specifically on
line 9.
1970s. I was pulled out and had
um.
Um, exercises where they train
your brain to
Uh, do a particular action or
So Mr. President, that's what
we're trying to change is the ed

actually teachers of kids with
dyslexia we're trying to change
that at prep.
current
That you know of.
Current teacher preparations
turn current standards, current
lesson plans, current tools.
So Mr. President.
That's why we're trying to do
this is because they don't have
And because how you teach kids
with dyslexia.
Thoroughly and completely is
structured literacy.
So
deconstruct the alphabetic code
for them.
Uh, so we don't have current
good instruction. I, I got my
Not one.
In teaching reading.
We've changed that here.
Um, Ed Prep standards are going
Thank you, um, Madam Protem, so
if I hear you correctly,
because dyslexia has been around
for a long time, 50 years at
least and what you're telling me
students even older students I
would think with uh with the
Lexia, dyslexia, is that
correct?
Uh, Mr. President, it is now we
have the Southwest International
they have all the tutoring, they
do all the testing. I want to
have the public schools be able
to fulfill that role.
Yeah, no, thank you, Madam
Prote. I understand, just wanna
make sure we include charter
schools.
Um, you know, it's, it's, can
early as 34, or 5. we require a
dyslexic screener in the first
month or so of first grade.
that's current policy. It is
what uh Senator Boone tried to
cut out, but luckily he wasn't
successful.
Thank you, Senator and um I
Corps, you didn't have to read
to be in there.
Um, and then he said, I just

from 10 to 15% and you can speak

it's a different way that your

It's a different brain.
Senator Block, thank you,
They are still um.
Constantly when they're reading
and writing, um, using the
training that they received, uh,
parents didn't tell him.
He gets to college, he can't
read. He's diagnosed with
dyslexia. Then he got all kinds
of help.

says, I'm the best red person,
but it's the best audiobooked
person.
Thank you for that, uh, story,
yeah, I'm well aware of, uh,
scientists, mathematicians, and
actors and so many different
other things in life and it's.
It's funny, um, when I look back
on it with my dyslexia.
fine there pulling alert with uh
a bunch of nuclear codes that I
would read backwards sometimes.
It's not, it's a little scary.
So
you focusing on dyslexia here
because it affects many, many
kids.
And I did not know it was 10 to
15% of the population, Mr.
President or Senator, um,
not a disability, Mr. President
or Senator. It's just one of
those things that people have to
deal with and there could be a
few of us in here that are
dyslexic as well.
helping students, uh, tackle
this issue of dyslexia.
Um,
And lastly, Mr. President and
What you did to help them for
treating dyslexia, yes, I have
not too many.
But one in particular, uh, I
went to his graduation.
Um,
my C-level classroom, so that
was pretty cool to see him
graduate.
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank
you, Senator, and I would, uh,
In 2nd grade help us overcome
