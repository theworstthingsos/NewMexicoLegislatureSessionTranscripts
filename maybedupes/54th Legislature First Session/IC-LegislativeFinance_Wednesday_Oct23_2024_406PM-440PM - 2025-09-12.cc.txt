have a subcommittee, a
subcommittee and that be here so
you will see all these agencies
before us.
And um
We will start immediately and,
uh, not Robert, here we go, um,
Charles will start.
With the first one, and we'll
get started.
Good afternoon, madam chair and
members of the subcommittee.
Uh, the first agency had turn
your attention to its
administrative hearings office,
which is agency code.
340 agency representative, the
director Brian and Deson
maybe.
Uh, the HO requested a general
fund increase.
199.9,000 or 7.8% over the FY
25.
Operating budget.
Uh, mainly this is driven by,
uh, an increased salary and
benefits to create uh
New administrative law judge
that was approved last session,
um, and also continue their
compensation.
Uh, plan that they put into
place and hire a new lock.
Some of the money is being moved
in the request, um, from other
categories to help fund it, but
overall it's a 7.8% or $200,000
increase.
Uh, remind the committee that an
FY 25.
Uh, the office received an
increase of 401,000 or 18.7%
above the prior year.
You have to stand for.
OK. Thank you very much, uh,
Charles, um, any questions from
the committee at this point.
Or any comments. OK, thank you
very much, Senator. We're gonna
do for the audience is what we
usually do. Most of you are
familiar with the process. What
we do is we hear the the request
in the budget as it is and then
we temporarily table it only for
continued discussion later put
the things together, but it
doesn't mean we're gonna table
you.
You know your requests at all.
Thank you very much. OK. Do we
have a second on the temporary
table. There's motion the 25 by
saying I.
Thank you, Charles. 35
retirement Board,
um, the director is David
Archuleta.
ERB requested a small decrease.
This is a an agency that does
not receive a general fund, but
they did request a small uh
decrease primarily in their
contracts of ERD and usually
have.
more money
Authorized in their contractual
services that they end up using,
you can see that.
Uh, in the table where their
actuals for FY 24 were only 11.1
million.
They had authority much larger
than that this year they've got
a 30 for 20 million for some
reason it needs to go back up.
You should adjustment.
But the real change in their
budget is to fully fund all of
their 91 positions, so your
request is for an increase in
personnel by 600,000.
Thank you very much, Charles. I
do we have any questions or
comments from the committee.
OK. Uh, before we move on, I
just wanted to start because
this is so different now is that
if there are any questions from
the committee members or
comments and so on, we need to
defer to the departments or the
agencies themselves do that if
there are no questions as to
proceed.
There's a motion for temporary
table. The second on paper
signified by saying I.
post. Thank you, Charles.
You can proceed agency,
Madam,
the public employees retirement
Association agency called 366.
I was the director.
requested that this is another
agency that uh I think it's a
small amount of 157,000.
Unique purpose related to social
security issues.
Um, but it's largely
Self-funded with its other
revenue.
Uh, however, parent did request
the 6.4 million or 15% increase,
and this is mostly for
contractual services, and you
can see those differences.
Actuals for 24.
I went with the budget amount is
is to go up to 31.2 million.
FY 26.
That, uh, so.
The requested spending is almost
twice the amount. Thank you very
much. Any questions or comments
from the committee. I do have
just one point to make, maybe a
short question if you can be
brief. We have Trujillo here
from the, the director of the
PRA, um, give me one sec here.
Uh, yes, OK, uh, right, I was
very impressed with the fact
that you are filling your
positions, the vacancies that
you had pretty quickly was
quickly about that, uh, about
your vacancy rates how they've
improved and so on. I, I heard a
little bit of.
About it and I just need a
little more information. Thank
you.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair,
uh, with.
Currently we actually have 3
vacancies, our vacancy rate, uh,
as of today was 3.4% um that's
actually gonna drop down uh.
We sent out an offer letter this
morning um when we did the
request, it was at 55 positions
at the
5.7%, so we're just hoping we,
we've done a good job with our
position that we are funded to
continue doing so.
Well, thank you. Thank you very
much for that. That's all I had.
You clarified it. I appreciate
all your hard work and all your
staff.
Thank you. All right. Motion for

this type of support for

coordinate.
Um, in response to historical
closure.
Types of things, but it's our
sort of liaison between state
government um and our bases
across New Mexico.
The Agency also requested an
increase of 40,000 for services
to track the uh agreements and
to make sure the deliverables
are met, so bit of a change and

small general fund.
appropriation currently at
380,000. The agency requested a
3.7% increase to 394,000.
The increase is primarily for
property insurance premiums.
Uh, part of the property

including the ticket revenue.
Um, and FY 24, the railroad at

continue to invest.
And that important economic.
Uh, development driver up in
that area of the state that.
Thank you, Charles. Any
comments, questions on the
committee.
This just really quick. I mean
it's such a low increase, uh, I
don't know if they would have.
Information but tracks.
They
In good condition.
They do anticipate continued
investments in maintenance and
upgrades, um, they also do
receive money from the state of
Colorado since this goes through
both states.
Uh, it's August 24 had expended
2.6 million, or about half of
the capital appropriations that
you're given for.
3 different projects.
OK.
Thank you.
We
I was just on the staff.
It's not working.
So we're gonna try and get it
fixed.
Um, OK, um, do we have any
comments, questions, Senator.
Emotion, OK? Any
motion in the second the
opposition.
It's done. So that's going on
and again it's a temporarily
table would be passed or
permanently.
All righty.
So
Spaceport Authority agency code
495.
Scott McLaughlin is the
director.
Spaceport Authority requested a
general funding increase of
82,000.
is another agency that
originally the intent was for it
to be an enterprise, however, uh
through the years you've uh as a
body.
a significant general fund
investments into its operations.
It also gets um
Local GRT revenue from
counties
Near the spaceport.
Uh
General request was for an
increase to the almost 83,000 or
2%.
Um, compared to the FYA 25
operating budget.
Um
Agency projects a decrease in
its other revenue of about
913,000 primarily due to the
reduction in virgin galactic.
User fees.
Um, as you may have seen in the
news, um, the spaceship that
they had been planning to use
and launch um from Southern New
Mexico is a transition to
something new and they're as a
result, the amount of money that
we thought was going to be
coming in from using the
spaceport, uh, it's going down
the request reflects that.
Um, the agency is requesting to
use a half a million for its
fund balance to offset some of
this decreased revenue.
And overall the agency requested
a reduction of 330,000 from all
funds.
When it comes to personnel
spending.
Uh, they
requested a decrease in revenue
was going down to 136,000.
Um, despite the requested
decrease.
The agency did ask for an
additional FTE for a STEM
workforce development.
The agency has about a 5.7%
funded vacancy rate.
You can see in your packet.
Agency didn't ask for an
increase in contractual
services, um, for about 487,000.
Um
Including
For some truck repairs and
airspace.
charges.
Your legal fees have gone down,
so they requested a drop in
those like 69%. OK. Thank you
very much. Any comments or
questions from the committee.
Motions for a temporary.
There's motion on the floor, 2.
Any opposition?

But then I'd be happy to answer
any questions.
Thank you, Charles. All right.
Do we have any questions,
comments from the committee.
Right, thank you
Emotional floor in a second in
the opposition.
OK. Thank you.
Um, we still kind of wondering,
I want to make sure that there's
a sound on there for the public.
Thank you, working now.
We're getting some information
that there was no sound so we
just wanna make.
It's kind of convoluted sound or
something where it's not being
understood. Hopefully it's
fixed.
All right.
OK, we're gonna go on to the
commission on the status of
women.
One.
Thank you. So this is a small.
Um
I've gone away for quite a while
and then was brought back
recently.
As a current actual spending of
295,000.
Uh, from the general fund and FY
24.
requested a 161,000.
Increase, it's about 38%
increase from FYO5.
The request, um, accounted for
increased cost and personnel.
Due to the commission bringing

cycle uh pay increases for the
direct.
be a PS Calc.
In your
The agency's personnel budget is
now underwater.
The agency reverted 51. OK.
Thank you. I see they have quite
a small budget actually.
So thank you very much. Any
comments or questions from the
Mary
That emotion for a temporary
table, right? motion the 2nd and
the opposition. All right, and
thank you to the commission on
the Status of Women, only for
the sake of time, we're moving
so quickly. We want to truly.
Some point soon, take some time
to thank you.
To Office of African American
Affairs, uh agency code 603.
We have an acting director
listed here, Charles Rido.
This is a another small agency
primarily well.
Almost all general fund.
As an operating budget is
slightly less than 1.3 for 10
FTEs.
The office requested a general
fund increase of 30,000 or 2.3%
over FY 25.
This was primarily for travel
costs to allow the agency to do
more community outreach
statewide.
FY 25, the agency received two
additional FTEs as of October
2024.
Uh, the office had 5 of the 10
FTEs filled, and about 346,000
in funded vacancy rates.
The agency was actively in the
hiring process for several
positions, um. Thank you,
Charles. OK, do you have any
comments or questions from the
committee, and before I go on, I
hear that it's been.
And the sound has been fixed, so
it's any different, let me know.
Thank you. Motion for a
temporarily table and a second,
do we have a second?
We temporarily table. You need a
second, a second. Any
opposition? Yeah, thank you. OK,
yup.
Now we're gonna move on to
workers' compensation
Administration and Agency 632
Charles.
And Heather Jordan is the
executive director, um, for A C
632.
This is another agency that
receives earmarked rib this
year, 14.
And
That revenue builds up and
accumulates over time.
Um
And so that this is one of the
agencies where we regularly
track their.
Cash balances, um, and so
sometimes you can use those cash
balances and budget and that has
about a little less than half a
million.
Um, built into it from cash
balances. This also is an agency
that does have a a transfer.
From
Uh, the fund to the workforce
solutions department for
related.
Activities, the agency typically
uh to back out of that transfer.
Uh, and did so again this year.
Their revenues generated by a
base assessment on worker
payroll in Mexico just to.
So, overall, the agency.
Reflects a net decrease of 2.7%
because the agency
Like I said, they requested to
not do that transfer anymore and
not spend it.
On their agency operations, so
it looks like it's a small
decrease.
Uh, but that would require a
change in funding over a
workforce solutions.
The request um for personnel
would allow the
Workers' compensation commission
to maintain a 10% vacancy rate.
And cover increased contract
costs associated with its IT.
Um, projects, uh, financial
auditing and security service.
Since the pandemic, expenditures
have grown faster than the
revenue generated by the um
assessment, so we are paying
attention to that.
Um
A fund balance situation.
Um
And looking at the need for
possibly
Um, not diverting as much.
OK. Thank you, Charles. Any
questions or comments?
Yes, for senator
there. I'm just wondering just
for a question.
Is cashal same as reserves?
Um
We look at
There's hundreds of imagery.
Um, and we look at those on a
regular basis.
And it, it gives us a picture of
cash on hand.
Um, in the treasury.
It doesn't tell us whether there
are liabilities against that
cash, and so we have to take,
sometimes we'll see a large
amount.
And we'll have to do additional
work. We've done that in a
solvency situation, um, but in
this case we're monitoring the
revenues coming in.
Expenses going out.
Um, and this is one that is
waving at me, this is OK.
I didn't know if he wanted to
answer
our 5% part that I'm going to.
And
we had the surplus. We don't.
Thank you. Seems quite small in
opposition.
OK done. Thank you for that.
We're gonna minors, um,
hospital.
662 I Agency 662.
So the
Beams is the CEO, but we also
have uh Lonnie Medina here, the
CFO.
Uh, to be able to answer any
questions that
You may have, um, remember
Minor's Hospital.
The 25 bed
acute care.
Long-term care and primary care
hospital up in Breton in Colfax
County, uh, that serves patients
all over northern New Mexico.
It's a state-owned hospital.
It's revenues come from.
Uh, patient fees, third party
insurance payers like Medicare
and Medicaid, and also receives
uh revenue from its um land
grant permanent fund.
The hospital requested a 1%
decrease in personnel and 12%
decrease in contractual
services.
Um, the other category is a 24%
increase due to healthcare cost
inflation.
This amounts to an overall 1% um
decrease.
And authorized spending.
Uh, in previous years, Minors
was financially struggling,
however, you made uh an
appropriation this past session
to settle the hospital's debt.
added a new IGT
intergovernmental transfer to
better leverage, uh, more
federal revenue.
And you provided it a
supplemental appropriation to
pay off the hospital's negative
fund balance. Importantly for FY
25, the hospital also received a
3.6 million special
appropriation to eliminate its
remaining debt service. So if
you've got cash.
Use it to pay off debt. That's
moving forward.
However, you
Even though you did provide
that, they didn't use it to
eliminate all of their debt
service.
Instead, they spent about a half
a million.
Um, to buy into that
intergovernmental transfer.
Um, to bring down other patient
revenues for its operations.
So they still must make a
minimum payment of 1 point that
I'd be happy to answer any
questions. Thank you, Charles.
questions.
motion on the floor, some second
temporarily table in the
opposition.
Charles.
it's a natural resources
trustee.
This agency has a 10.8 million
operating budget for the current
year.
Uh, Maggie Hart Stebbins is the
natural resources Trust has 5
authorized FTE for FY 26.
The trustee requested a total
budget of 10.5 million.
Made up of 970,0009.5 million.
From the Natural Resources
Trusee Fund for damage
assessment.
And restoration projects.
This is a slight decrease
overall of 4%.
Um, but the general fund
increase was for an increase of
21% or about 170,000.
The agency expects to do
slightly less in terms of
contractual services work on
restoration, um, but the
increase in
Requested revenues to primarily
fund an increase in
Uh, the personnel.
With that, I'd be happy to
answer your questions. OK. Thank
you, Charles. I do remember um.
During this presentation. Thank
you, Maggie, for this.
Appreciate all your work.
OK, I don't have any questions,
any questions from the motion.
Thank you. There's a motion on
the floor in a second,
temporarily table, no
opposition.
Done. Thank you, Charles. We
move on.
Public school facilities
Authority, uh, agency code 940.
Iris Romero is the new executive
director. We're happy to have
her. Uh, I sit on the public
school capital outlay council,
and it's been a pleasure to work
with her and her team.
Doing a good job.
Public schools facility
authority um staffs the council,
and they're responsible for
working with all of our school
districts around the state to
upgrade, um,
And replace schools or make
improvement projects.
Um
Have a pretty sophisticated
system in New Mexico for
financing and upgrading well
north of $2 billion since its
inception over the past 20
years, that has come at the
expense of, um,
Inflows into the severance type,
a good example of an opportunity
cost that we chose to invest.
And now challenges and problems
as opposed to saving that for
the long term.
Um, but that's where it's
It's funding comes from. It's
basically an intercept of
severance taxes that would
otherwise go to the general
fund. Instead, they are bonded,
uh, and used to fund uh public
school facility authority
projects.
It's operating budget sits at
7.4 million.
Uh, this year from those, uh,
other revenues.
About 5.9% of it, so.
People intensive organization.
So 5.9% of it is for uh its
staff.
Their budget requests, um, for
FY 26 was 7.9 million, 483,000
or 6.5% increase over its
current.
Operating budget.
The request, uh, included
funding to add 2 FTE.
Uh, to address and anticipated
increase in the number of new
projects, uh, uh, due to the
matching rate.
Uh, changes that you made to, to
bring in additional
Uh, school districts, uh, into
the capital outlay process to
upgrade their facilities. Uh, it
also uh would find in-house
expertise for energy efficiency,
uh, design work.
Agency also requested a 3%
increase to its personnel budget
for performance-based salary
adjustment separate from any
compensation that you might.
Uh, otherwise do. Thank you and
thank you for your comments.
About your work experience with
the staff. Um, thank you for
your work.
All right, any comments or
questions? OK, do we have a
motion in a second, any
opposition.
Yeah. Thank you so much. We go
to our last one, education trust
board number 940.
And the executive director of
the
Educational Trust board.
This board manages the 529
college savings plans that are
available to consumers in New
Mexico and nationwide.
Um
The agency is fully funded
through administrative fees
assessed on those plans and does
not receive any general fund.
Revenue, as you can see from
your tables.
Additionally, um, this agency
does not show up in House Bill 2
as it is a quasi-governmental
entity, but we do uh like to
work with the agency to show you
their operating budget.
Um
And they, they establish it
through a budget adjustment
request and it, like I said,
it's not in the GAA for FY 26,
the agency requested a 91,000 or
2.8% decrease.
The Majority of the decrease is
for um marketing and outreach
where they don't feel they need
uh that amount of resources to
get.
OK, thank you very much for
that. Any comments or questions?
OK, motion. OK. There's a
motion, motion for temporary
table in a second in the
opposition.
We're done. Thank you, Charles.
Thanks to everyone for their
patience, for people sitting
still out there in the audience,
and of course, thank you to

we'll see Linda as our new
senator here, January 1st, and
