Good morning. And
here we are on
Friday, back to
business.
We are on
the
six item,
the regular
session by the numbers with
Mr Trujillo
and
Trujillo. And
I'm excited for these guys to
hear what you guys have to say.
I've heard some of it
before. So you
may begin whenever you're ready. Thank
you and thank you for joining
us.
Um Already
>> forgot.
Hopefully, the feedback is not too
bad.
Um I
want to begin this morning by
uh uh thank you madam chair for
inviting us uh
as she mentioned, uh this
past summer, she actually attended
uh annual conference for the
Dairy Producers of New Mexico.
Uh And we
uh Jen and I were given the
presentation and afterwards
she came up and asked
if I would speak to this
committee.
So we're very honored to be here
again, madam chair. Thank you for
the opportunity to, to
present
um
You, do you want to talk about
Slevin
A
two?
Can you go ahead and go to the next slide for
me in the
introduction?
There we go. You
got it
when my
heart.
>> So we have, we
have a lot of data points
here on this,
on this presentation,
we could talk for
hours, we
love to data crunch
and kind of make
sense of the process
with something physical
like crunching
data.
But what we're going to do
today is just kind of pull out some
of the highlights and maybe talk
for about 20 minutes and leave
some room for questions at the
end.
>> Um
I want to begin by getting a little background
on myself. Uh And then I'm
gonna give Jen an opportunity to do
so. Uh But I want to
begin with the most important thing for
those of you that haven't figured it out.
Uh I'm lucky enough to
work with my wife Jen.
Uh And uh she does
has been pretty much with me
for my 20 year
career. Uh more
recently, uh She's
been helping me
with the lobbying practice
as a part of the law firm.
And with that, she's kind of been the
manager of uh
over years. We've had
big teams,
small teams and
she's been really the one
both in front and behind the scenes to
make everything happen for me.
Uh
Myself, I was born in
Silver City, New Mexico.
Uh Those of
you that have been around also, probably
know my father, Tony
Trujillo. Uh He was gonna try to
make it up for the presentation. He's
also has done this presentation
with us on several occasions.
So I think he's watching
today. So shout out to my
father. Uh
if he is
watching
and mother. Yes. I'm sorry,
I'm mom.
Well, she's the most important
one as everyone knows to make sure we
all stayed uh
behaved.
Um, anyway,
so I, I received my undergraduate
degree in finance from the University of
Arizona. Uh then
did my MB A at
Western New Mexico University.
Uh And then I went back to
uh University of Arizona and completed
my law degree.
Uh Currently
I'm with, uh
for those of you who don't know,
I'm with, I have my own
law firm law group, but I'm
also of council
with a larger group called Gallagher
and Kennedy that's based out of
Phoenix. Uh And
I'm of council with them.
Uh My legal practice
focuses mainly
on environmental natural
resources law.
Uh I do that about half
time and then the other half of,
of my life I, I
uh lobby, I began lobbying
in New Mexico. About 2005
was my first year.
Uh I tried to count these other day,
I think over the 20 years,
I probably represented about 100
clients ranging
from you, probably pick a
topic and I probably lobbied
on behalf uh of
topics on all sides over
the, the 20 years.
Uh With that, I'll turn over
to Jen her, give you a little bit of background on
herself.
>> So Jennifer Trujillo,
I am a native Santa
Fe. I spent
some of my, actually, most of my
childhood in
Denver. Um
came back to New
Mexico for high school.
Um,
got my Bachelor's
in communications and pr
from UN M and
later on my, uh,
my MB A from
Western New Mexico
University. Uh
I spent,
once our first son was born,
left the workforce
and, um, spent
about 16 years raising three
boys until
they were able to
get themselves to wherever
they needed to go. And that's when I
hopped back into the
workforce with TJ.
Um,
I lobby.
Um, I kind of
do the background
stuff. Um,
with TJ. Um,
he's definitely more
the face of our
lobbying practice.
Um
And that's, that's
about me. Uh
I think TJ covered the rest
with our clients.
>> And before,
before we jump in, I want
to give you a little background, the presentation.
Uh I was telling
Senator Souls, uh,
that, uh we've
basically been collecting this
data for about the last 20 years
when, since when I first started,
uh,
you know what I
started noticing when I first started
was patterns were
occurring and I always wondered why
certain patterns were, were
occurring in the legislative process
ranging from
bill introductions and
why questions they
started asking why
um, with
this, with the House having
double, you know, more than
double the amount of members,
why on bill introductions
was always the same
relative to the House and the Senate,
right? More legislators
when I first started, I would have thought that
you would have more bill introductions in the
House versus the
Senate by a significant
volume, as you'll see in some
of the data as I go
through. Uh, that's not
the case and there's reasons why
that we can talk about.
Um, but that's some of the
reasons when I first started, I was
curious, uh,
as, as to patterns
that I was seeing as a lobbyist
on this side trying to
figure out how to influence
the legislature, advocate for my
clients.
Um So that's
really where this started.
Uh Back then when I first
started, I want to mention too
that uh uh
there wasn't, it was just
the beginning of reporting service,
reporting services.
So for those of you that aren't familiar
with the different kinds of reporting
services, uh
There's two currently in New
Mexico. One is New Mexico legislative
Reports and
there's a second one roadrunner.
Uh And,
and they basically track
bills, provide bill
analysis to folks like me and it's
a fee for uh subscri
subscription service. A lot of the
data comes from
these two services as well
as from other public sources
like the legislative web
page. A lot of
manual counting of being
able to go through and figure out
uh what the numbers
are. Uh But
that gives you a little idea on the background
and the data. So most of the data comes
from those two fee for service
tracking services
also comes from
the legislative web
page and then just other
resources at one point
uh back when Paula
Tackett, who was with Legislative
Council, she would sit down and check
my work back in
the early years to make sure
that the data
was there. And in fact, sometimes she
added, why don't you take a look at
this next year? And
that's kind of evolved from
Raul used to help me with those kind
of issues here and
there. So that
kind of gives you a little perspective on
the background of, of
where we get the data from and,
and, and
why
go ahead and go to the next slide for
us
the next
one?
OK. Slide
five.
>> So, oh,
sorry.
As you all know,
we've got a
majority
democratic
legislative
body just about
two thirds of each
chamber are
democrat
heavy.
Um
But
we,
sorry, I lost my, my
track
here.
Um
We've got a democratic
full control of the legislature.
Sorry about
that.
>> Oh, sorry about
that.
Uh Go ahead and go to the next slide,
please. Slide
six.
Uh This is one that we
started really doing about 10
years ago uh because we
started seeing the change
and at that point,
this is a, a slide of
uh simple slide of urban versus
rural legislators. Now again,
probably depends how you, you're
gonna maybe ask me during questions.
Well, how did you count this? I'll,
I'll give you the
uh the rough estimate
of, of how we do it. Basically, we
use, consider
urban, the Middle
Rio Grande Corridor being
Santa Fe, uh
Buro County
and Dona Ana County.
Um That's just an
easy marker as,
as we're able to,
to tell
the difference between districts, some of the
districts will overlap and we can get
in to some more of those
uh factors as to
a district having more
urban uh
versus uh
more rural
and how we kind of look at those numbers.
But that in our counting
uh and this is a, a
trend that is more
recent. Um I
would say about five years ago,
as we were tracking this data, you saw
the jump from more
urban. It was really, I
would say kind of 5050
up until about 56 years ago. And that
jumped now to where you
have more urban legislators
from more urban areas
represent more urban
districts depending
on how you count. As you can see up
there in the
numbers.
Go ahead and go to the next slide. Four slide
seven.
>> Very good
representative.
>> Thank, thank you madam chair.
And, and
so so when you say
that
you turned it off on
me,
see I'm
done.
So, so when you say that, what was
the time frame
>> five years ago,
about 56 years ago, it was when
you saw that
switch and a lot of it is
obviously, what do we do? 56656
years ago, we did redistricting, right?
And so the way we would count
those uh legislative
districts before
changed with redistricting. And
that's why the, that's really
one of the primary drivers of the
Dr >> And,
and that was my
question is how did
redistricting affect that?
And I'm glad you hit on that. Thank
you. >> And
we could talk a little more about this later
on. But again,
uh every five years
or I'm sorry, every 10 years, as you
know, you go through that process
and that's why some of the differences
in the legislative makeup,
uh you'll see changes in the
pattern.
We'll go to the
slides.
>> So a lot of these metrics
that we're
tracking,
we're trying to see
trends, you know, the
previous slide, rural versus
urban
bill introductions
voting patterns.
It really does make a
difference if
you're a rural or an
urban legislator
where your priorities
lie.
Same on this
slide post
the 2024
election, we now have a
female majority in the
legislature.
And it's our
belief that
there is a difference
in
to some extent in
a female voting pattern.
Um And in
priorities versus the
males.
So again, uh
age we believe
has an impact
on voting patterns,
uh also
priorities
and right now, both in the
House and the Senate. Uh,
the majority, the,
the age group majority
are baby boomers
followed by genx.
Um We
have
very, very
small amounts of
millennials and a little
tiny bit of Gen Z in
there. Did
you
>> with that little
blue
>> 20?
This, uh this
information
is compiled
with hours and hours
and hours of Google searches
on all of
you.
>> I, I'm gonna comment on it. She
helped me pull all the data and find it. And
I asked her, I'm wondering forever,
where do you get the ages of, of
legislators?
Because as you know,
most trying to get
background on, on legislators
is very, very difficult.
Um The there's no
uniformed system,
you know, you look on the legislative
website, uh
you know, it's not consistent in
terms of how people as you'll see
on upcoming slide
occupations.
Um There are different
ways to report all that
stuff. And so the age
she was very successful in
uh stalking everyone
on the internet and social
media to at least get a rough
idea. Some of them weren't
sure. So we guessed I would
say probably two or
three
if I in terms of the
age, but like this, I would
say is a pretty,
almost accurate, pretty
accurate depiction
of, of the age of the legislatures
at this point.
Um Go
ahead and go to slide
nine.
Um This is a
very,
uh the next couple of slides
are some of my favorite slides that I,
I love to pull out.
Uh This is years of
service and this is
years of service in the house.
And the next slide you don't have
to go there yet, but the next slide will be,
will be the Senate.
Um
Go, go back at to the
house real quick. Go back in the
up button.
Oh, that's all right. No, you're back. I'm
sorry,
Um
Without getting into the details
on this cause I want to leave uh
some time for some of these other
slides. Basically, the point of,
of these next two slides is
you have declining years of
experience. Uh I
circled the 9 to
12
terms
on this one to,
you know, show that on
13 to 16
in 2019,
you had legislators that were
in office during that time
period. Fast forward, you still
do, but the graph
is bumped up in 2025.
So you kind of see you had
a big surge of
new Republicans.
Uh And you also had
those in
2019 when you had a bunch of
new Democrats, they're now what
I would call 5 to 8 year
term uh
Democrats that are in the
House.
Um
Why do we try? Well, go ahead and go
to the next slide from the Senate and,
and again, same point here,
same uh
pattern
with respect to years of
service, again,
declining years of service, the Senate,
obviously, as I'm sure the
senators can talk about have a bunch
of new faces uh that
have joined them.
And uh why
do we track this?
Uh We track it
because the
institutional knowledge
of, of not only
subjects but the
process matters
uh matters uh significantly.
I, I would say and so this is
a, a trend
that uh
is obvious to some but
I, but I think it is very
important uh
behind the scenes
on the process for, for the
legislature.
No,
that was slide
10.
Um
Let's go ahead and go to slide 11 if that's
all
right.
>> This is one of the
most difficult
graphs for me to
compile. Um
simply because
a very large number
of legislators
are kind of listed
as working for
a nonprofit, which
could mean anything.
And so a lot of times
I find it difficult
to
categorize that are you
in management? Are you
in, you know,
any number of
positions? And so I
think for the past
couple of years, I've just finally decided
to create nonprofit,
its own
bar on
here. Um
But the one thing that
I think the the
biggest takeaway
here is that our
legislators are
very educated
with really,
actually I jumped ahead
to another metric
here, but very
successful
legislators,
obviously, you are
unpaid
in this current
role. And so you obviously
need to have some kind
of support outside of
that.
>> So the military,
you just have it in the Senate, we
have one in the
House,
do I not
count. >> You
absolutely count. Is that
your
career?
OK. If
it's,
yeah, so
listing military
is a, is an
actual, that's
your career, not that
you have served.
Um But
absolutely,
>> and again, going
back to the, it's, it's a great example.
A lot of this is based on self
reporting by the legislators.
And when they talk about education
or occupation, if you look
on the, let the
we legislative website,
there's a category for that.
Some of these reporting services
I talked about earlier will
have the,
we attempt to list
the occupations of the legislators
in their. So this is a compilation of
our, our best guess of how
it's self reported.
Senator Souls has a
question.
>> I, I have just a quick
question. I mean, this includes if
people are retired but what their
career had been,
uh I notice on
here there isn't anybody
that kind of works for
a job, you know,
there's, you know, nobody work
in nos just gets
a paycheck. Is
that accurate or did they get
categorized in some other
field or area
>> go around
to the best
that I could find.
Um let's say you did work
in retail but you're
a retail manager.
Um I, I placed you
under management.
Um
I, I don't
recall finding
anyone that worked in
retail.
Um but
in terms of
I
this graph would be out of
hand if I listed.
Exactly. And
so I, I tried to do the best I
could to kind of create
bubbles >> of, of
course. And that was part of
the, the comment
was, you know, I
regularly tell people there's
very few people who have a boss
for a job. I mean that they
get a paycheck on Fridays,
you know, they go to work every morning or
anything of that sort
because that doesn't fit with
being a legislator very well,
that you can take two months
off and expect that your job in
manufacturing is still there
working the line or
something.
>> Representative
down. Thank you
madam chair. Who I'm just
curious who the clergy is. I
remember that we had, I
think Bash,
Bash was. I'm just curious who
the clergy is. >> I
believe that's
repres Senator
>> Rt.
Thank you madam
chair.
>> Yeah, but he listed
his occupation as something
else. It's
an education I think is what, what he
had is listed
his, his employment. So, yeah,
to the point, this is kind of our
best way to group
uh as about as accurate
as we can be.
Uh slide 12.
I think we're doing pretty good on time
here.
>> So this one was um
it's, it's a delight to
see. Um at
the end of the day, our
legislators are highly
educated.
This also to
some extent can be a little
bit difficult to find
information on.
Um But it's
getting easier and
easier as we go. There's
more information out there.
But at the end of the day,
we, we have very educated
legislators in our
state.
>> Just a, a follow up comment on this
one. I will tell you about five
years ago, we were looking at
uh N CS L
data on
education of legis
legislatures
around the country.
And I don't have that
graph with me, but I can tell you that New
Mexico actually still
by, by percentage
was one of the most highly
educated bodies uh across
the country. Um
I'm sure and I'm sure that's the same because this
is only grown.
>> I also think that this ties
into being an unpaid
legislative body
that you need to be
educated and
well employed in
order to volunteer
your
time.
Oh,
sorry.
Uh Over we
track it over about a 20
year period as you'll see in the, in the follow-up
graphs. But these are some of my favorite graphs.
Why do we track this stuff?
Obviously, a lot of this is
for our clients also that
we have to basically explain
to them what it takes to
pass the bills. So I'm
expecting that question in advance
at the back and, and,
and questions, but really,
we use this to explain
to clients um
more
quantitative as
to uh what
it takes to pass a and why
the different dynamics occur.
So with that, uh let me go
to slide 14 and I'll
turn that over to Jen to
do.
>> All
right.
So in the
2025
session, a total
of 1108
bills were introduced
in total.
Out of those bills.
195 passed
both chambers and then
were sent to the governor
out of those
195
bills. The governor
signed 160
of them and vetoed
35.
>> Go to slide
15.
Thanks.
So this is not my EKG,
this is actually
AAA slide here about
bill introductions.
Um,
the one
we dig a little deeper
on this slide and this is both bill introductions
during 30 60 60
day sessions and you can see the
markers down bottom on
the graph or it will show you
the terms of governor or
the bill introduction during Governor
Richards, former Governor Richardson.
Then you'll see, uh, former
governor Martinez and then you'll see
the current governor and the,
the level of bill introductions, I
will say, as you look at these is
as you are in the middle
of aware, we had a little
hiccup in uh uh
2020 21
2020 2021
and 22.
That as you look at the data,
recognize those are the COVID
years and you guys did
things very, very different and we're
under different restrictions as you
know. Uh
so the data is kind of skewed
but it's not too far off actually as you
look at the graph.
Um,
here a couple of the interesting
observations, bill introductions
under uh the current governor
have been slightly
lower. I say
primarily due to the pandemic
is what I would attribute it to. But I
think there's some, some other
factors as you'll see
some of their data. And although
I mentioned this earlier, although the House
has double the amount of,
of members I would have
as I as you can see on this because
I have the Senate and,
and House introductions. It pretty much
tracks the same
over the last 20 years in terms of
the number of bill introductions. Why
we can talk about? I got some different
theories on that, but
I find that interesting. Uh
what that means
is uh
the senators are really
carrying double the amount of
bills as a single
uh house house of
representative member.
If you do all the averages
out,
um
go ahead and go to slide 16
for me.
This is just out of that
previous graph. I we pulled
out just the 60
the, the 60 day session
because that's what we just had. And
this is a cleaner picture
for you to, to show you
that again. This has been
a, a slightly decrease,
um, number of bill
introductions. I'm sure
we'll get a question later about
why is it so high under
Governor Richardson, I can talk
a little bit, a little bit about that if you
would like me to do so at
a, in a little bit. But
under the Republican and the
current Democrat, former Republican,
current Democrat governor,
bill directions have pretty much
been the same, I mean, slight deviations
here and there as you can see but
not big changes in the
pattern.
Go ahead and go to slide
17.
>> All right. So to T
J's point,
the amount of bills
passing through both chambers
have been slightly
lower under our current
governor,
compared with
the former Governor
Martinez,
a Republican
and former governor
Richardson
by far over
there as
a
Democrat,
go ahead and go to the
next.
And so these are the numbers,
um just based off of 60
day sessions alone
for bills that
passed through both chambers
again, just a slight
decrease with the
current governor versus
the two former or at
least two former
governors.
Um The,
the surprising
thing is uh for
the, the last 60
day session in 2025
there was another drop
in in bill
introductions and, and
passages
and
we, we definitely
have some ideas on
why that's low. And we
think that
likely uh
the
the amount of new legislators
we've got about a third of
our entire body new
for the 2025
session
>> slide
19.
Uh again, another one of
my favorite slides
here. Uh and this, this
big, this slide shows
the passage rates for
bills, meaning
uh out
of the total bills introduced
during the session, what percentage
of the bills that act was the percentage
of the bills that actually passed?
Um And
this slide looks at it both
for again, 3060 day
sessions, uh
60 day range. As you can see
there, I did some circles on, on
the graph 60 day
range was what is it?
27.5 to
14.9%
on the low end 30 day
range,
21.9%
and 7.7%
for 30 days on the low end.
Um and
again, pretty consistent you'll
see on the, go ahead and go to the next slide.
You'll see when I pull out the data just
for the, for the 60
days uh
sessions. You pretty much got
a, a high, low.
Uh and it's been pretty
consistent, you know,
with some drops here and there for
particular reasons.
Uh uh
You see a big decrease there in
2015.
Uh for those of you who have been around, we
can talk a little bit about why
2015 compared to others.
But again, uh,
you see that it remains
pretty constant, relatively
speaking, not huge, major
swings in terms of the
total number of bills that are ultimately
passing relative to the number
of, of bill
introductions.
Yeah,
it's like 20 did.
Um, it's like
21.
>> So I think the, the key
takeaway on this is
that there were a lot
of bills enacted
under former Governor
Richardson
versus
obviously the, the
next former Governor
Martinez. Um,
we did have kind
of a, I'm trying to look
at the year there. Yeah, under
2019,
a little jump there,
but
that they've
declined since
former Governor
Richardson was in
office
in the next
slide.
Um
The key takeaway on this
slide is that for the
2025
legislative session,
there was a, a
big drop in
the total bills enacted
compared to previous
years again, especially
during the former Governor
Richardson's
years
next
slide.
Uh Governor
Lujan Grisham has
vetoed quite
a bit less
bills than her
former
counterparts
>> including Governor Richardson
if you know
this
>> next
slide.
So these are the total
bills vetoed for 60 day
sessions for the last two
decades.
Um
This kind
of shows the takeaway
that Governor Lujan Grisham
has vetoed a lot
less bills than her
former counterparts.
Um
You'll see the green
circle up on the screen.
There's a significant,
less number of vetoed
bills than both
the Governor Martinez
and Richardson.
The next
slide.
>> Couple more slidess here. But I, I
really want to emphasize the, these
two slides because
I, I think this is the most
important thing about the
legislature. And I really
think that uh
when I deal with clients
that have an interest in the
legislative branch,
uh this
is the message that I tell them.
Um, this
slide is, uh,
gives you for 2024
and 2025. I
take you back to one of the previous slides
where for this 2025
session, what was a
17.6%
passage rate
uh right there. So
keep that 17.6%
in your mind as we look at the 2025
numbers, what we
did in this, in this
line uh is we actually
went back and counted all
the votes in favor
and votes in opposition
to all the bills that
passed the
17.6. For instance, in
the, in the 2025
session, we did a
2024 because I wanted to
see if there was a big difference
compared to 24 to 25.
But for both
of these two years, we
literally went through every single bill
went, pulled up the votes that were
taken and counted. How
many were for it? How many were against
it? Uh Where the two
markers, obviously, there's some people that are
excused and, and stuff
like that. Uh
Really what it shows you is
most of the legislation
that passed
was not controversial.
Most of the legislation that
passes is
by through bipartisan
support. Uh Go
ahead and go to the next graph for
me,
this just takes the same data and
puts it in uh
percentages.
So literally 90
90% of, in 2025
90% of, of the
votes uh
taken in the
house, you
know, were for the, the, all
the bills that passed 10%
were, were against.
And we looked at this different ways
and I've always tried to figure out
how to best demonstrate
this. But,
um, again, it really goes
back to the, to the standpoint
because of the way the
legislature the process
is set, set
up, what ends up
happening is as you all
know, there's only a
certain number of contro controversial
bills. You can actually deal
with where you got where you don't have
bipartisan support
and they suck up a bunch
of time and resources during
the legislative process
and there's other reasons
why, but I would say that's the primary
indicator uh as
to why. So if you go to 20 it's like
27
and I, I got one minute
left. Uh
So I, I, we're on
time, but really,
again, the, the bottom line
is that for us,
as we looked at the, at the data
is that year after year. If you could
slip, go to the next slide,
literally year after
year, the numbers
demonstrate that the new Mexico
legislature despite
bipartisan, I
mean, uh despite partisan
rancor, despite
media coverage,
uh really what happens,
it, it's an amazing process.
I, I told folks because
um to answer
one of the questions I posed earlier, what do
I tell clients? Well, if you want to pass a
bill, you can need to get
bipartisan support. If you
have any controversy
surrounding your bill.
There's just a very, very
small fraction of that
17.6%
in 2025 that
passed. I told you,
what is it? About 10% where
votes are against it?
So that's 10% of that
17.6.
I mean, you're talking just a
handful of bills at 5, 10,
you said in the floors and
of both the House and the Senate
and how many, I mean, yeah, you'll get
one or two periodically
towards the end, you'll get a bunch
more. But the reality of most
of the work the legislature does
and the system itself
currently is
designed to create
compromise.
So that's our message
that we clients, the, the message
that the madam chair
heard us deliver to the dairy
industry. And, uh I think in
fact, next week we got
the same presentation
to uh leadership New
Mexico. So we, we
travel around and get this presentation
and, and I think in
our opinion, uh
and both of us
have been around, we got a tremendous amount
of respect for all legislators
simply because you give
up your time. Uh
and you go into a process
and I think not enough
credits given to the fact that
really most of the work, the
legislature does is,
is bipartisan
and advances critical
bills.
So with that, we're open for questions.
Do you have any extra
comments?
>> Thank you. And we have
Representative Vice Chair
>> Johnson.
Thank you madam chair. Good
morning, everyone. Good
to see you. I am
Representative Wanda
Johnson. I represent house
district five
mckinley San Juan counties
and just good morning.
Glad to be here.
>> Thank you madam, Vice
Chair and Senator
>> Souls. Thank you madam
chair. Uh One
of the things that I find interesting,
I think it's on pages 22
and 23
where there was
a lot vetoed
in the last
year of the Martinez
one and then a jump in the
Lujan Grisham one,
that one. And you may remember
there was what was called the rocket
Docket, which took a whole lot
of the veto bills that
passed almost with unanimous
support were introduced very
quickly and something like
65 of them got
done and passed in the first two
weeks. And so I think
that's that spike and those were
bipartisan, those were dem bills
Republican bills. I mean, everybody
was kind of on board for that.
And so just, you know, as
I'm looking at it,
remembering back to
that particular,
um, issue with it.
Uh, the only real question
is, is it OK
to plagiarize all of this? I do
lots of presentations for
groups. May I use
your slides and, and
data and things like that?
Is that ok to
to use and to do and, and
such because it really is good
information
when I'm trying to talk with people
that most of the
votes when they get to the senate
floor don't go down
on a partisan divide.
Most of them are
more rural,
urban. I mean, they're north
south. I mean, there's all kinds of
other issues. Most of them
don't split just on a straight
partisan divide. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Senator Representative
Roybal Kaleo.
Thank you madam chair
and um
thank you
for
all of your
analysis.
Sorry.
So I had just the,
um a few, a few
questions, looks like I have a lot,
but I, I'm
prioritizing them.
Um Let me get my
reference point on the page
numbers on page
11. I'm just
wondering if there were any
legislators that
um I
listed their
occupation or listed
themselves as
retired.
>> Yes. Uh madam
chair and representative.
Absolutely.
Um
I didn't feel like that would
be a good representation
about who
this person was by saying
they were retired. I wanted to
honor what,
what their
career path had
been.
>> Thank you. Madam chair. So it
was primarily
you zeroed in on
occupation.
Ok.
Um
For the purposes of
this
committee,
you know, where
we
are the Indian Affairs Committee.
And so
I
really appreciate the
breakdown on rural
urban because
that
sort of overlays
um where
tribal nations and
pueblos might
or might not
uh
be
predominant,
but it's still kind of
hazy
because we don't
necessarily
have the
analysis as it relates
to uh native
American voters
and trends
thereof.
Um
So
I'm wondering if
your ana how we
can break down your
analysis
um
Given that you've indicated that
there's been a decline in
legislative
experience.
Um How
does, how would this
affect
institutional
understanding of tribal
sovereignty,
consultation
obligations,
um Rural
tribal infrastructure
needs.
How do
you have reason or a way
to be able to
provide that
or
assess that from the information
that you're extrapolating
from
>> madam chair and
representative. I think
that it would be fairly easy
to extrapolate that
that information
and be able to
show another
either line on the
graph or a separate
graph
>> to follow up on the point you made. I I
think you're spot on to
something just from
practical experience from those
that they on again,
two decades.
Um I
think from a Native
American standpoint,
you had in from
2000 to
2010,
a lot of
uh of the
representatives of the
rep and senators represented
those areas have been in office for
quite some time and I can give you some
examples, but you had a long
institutional knowledge. Again,
I think you've seen a lot of turnover
of those
legislators that represent Native
American uh issues.
A lot of that's due to redistricting.
Um And, and keeping
some of making
some of those districts
swing districts. We have uh
slides on all that about
redistricting. I
participated in two
years as an attorney
uh representing various
parties. Um
But I think redistricting
has had a lot to do
with that because uh
some of the legislative
districts that represent native American
interests uh are
what I call plus or minus five
points as you look
at the redistricting numbers.
Uh And, and
that's why you're getting some of the more
turnover in those districts
than what I would say
the previous decade
before.
>> Thank you madam chair.
And so
along the same
lines
with the majority of
legislators coming from
urban areas.
How do you think this
influences the prioritization
of rural and tribal
issues? Do you
have a way to
opine
on that?
>> Yeah, I, I
again, we, I would uh trying
to pick out some of the more relevant
graphs but what I would tell you
and for purposes of this
presentation, but we have
graphs about swing votes as an
example. How do you define a swing
vote? Uh Yes,
it makes a difference because what happens is
you see a lot of those rural legislators
then becoming more a swing
votes on issues, especially when the
numbers are a little bit closer
5 to 6 years ago.
Um You know, you look at some
of the, what I call the more controversial
bills. Uh Some
of those Native American
legislators,
uh or legislators
that represented native American
districts. We're actually
a lot more inclined
to switch to, not
necessarily go along with the party line
vote and there's ways yes to,
to, to classify that
bottom line. I think it,
it, what that
does is causes
more of a
outlier in terms of voting
patterns for those
particular legislators that
are from rural
areas that represent Native
American interests.
>> Thank you, madam chair.
And how would you define
controversial
>> on most of the graphs that we
do? Uh
We say if there's more than
25% of the vote
is against of,
of the total votes, we'll look at how
many no votes. So if
it's more than 25% so, you
know, sometimes you'll get, as you
probably are well
aware legislators
that you'll have like five or
six. I'll
pick on the Republicans just
uh you'll have five or six because
they're in the minority
votes. They need to vote
a certain way because of their district.
But that's not necessarily means that
those four or five votes or six
votes that the overall bill
is controversial because you'll get a bunch
more uh
Republicans that will
vote for the bill.
Um So that's why we say
about 25%
rough number, but at
least you got enough
Republicans voting
against something uh
that it makes a difference.
>> Thank you, madam chair
and um you,
I'm,
everything that you've presented
is really helpful
and we'll be
seeking, I'll be asking
a lot more detail, but
just two more questions
given that women hold the majority
in the legislative,
in the legislature. Have
you observed
any
shifts
in legislative
priorities
based on that
and
how those are
negotiated
um towards
passage. Have you
observed
that
>> my perspective
here,
do you want me to go first?
Um, I,
you know, again, sticking
to just the data and the numbers,
what I've seen shift,
um, due to having
more females,
as you see, a lot more
dispersion in committee
assignments and,
and bills being
considered. There's
used to be some committees that you only
get, you know,
outside of Senate finance
as an example or
judiciary or in
the House House Appropriations.
And now what you're seeing
is we just attract this
to and still do,
but we track the number of referrals
to each committee. So we can
see, you know, is,
are the bills getting more
deliberative? Yes, there's a
political game to it. Granted
of bills going to certain
committees. But what you see is a lot
more
debate.
Um, and consideration
by committees, I
think due to the switch
over from females
not having,
uh,
uh, a majority
overall in the legislature
is the trend I've noticed just by the
numbers not talking about
anything other than, than that
trend.
>> We haven't tracked
specific, you know,
any specific issues
that I could definitively
say that having
a female majority
or just more
females in the legislature
period has made a
difference. I, I
do, I, I can
recognize that there,
the, the
conversation has changed.
Um There is a focus
on children's
issues, family,
um health
care, you name
it, you know, and not
in any way to be stereotypical,
but as a as
mothers
in the seat,
considering our
Children in, in the
state.
>> Thank you madam chair. And this is my
last question.
Um You noted
that the in the
2025 regular
session, we had one of
the lowest passage rates
for the for a
60 day
session.
Did you observe or have
you looked at
any
particular
structural or procedural
factors that contributed to
this low rate?
And, and just
before I close on that question,
madam chair, I
want to make sure that we can cite
you when we use
these,
this data. So
you did say it was OK to
use it and it's OK to cite
you. OK. So
back to the question.
Thank you madam chair. And that's my
last question.
>> I I'll take a stab and
then if you want to go, I I
really think the key
in my opinion from everything I've seen,
just looking at the numbers and the
structure and being familiar with the
process, I think a lot
of it just due to new, a bunch of
new legislators.
Um That's
why I think there's a little passage rate.
I mean, uh
I've, I've heard the, the
speakers as well as
the madam Prot,
you know, talk about as they're looking
at Bills and even Senator
Wirth, he'll say, you know, right
away. I, I
think that legislator doesn't
know a new one that this idea
has been introduced before.
Um, I think the second issue
is you've got a big turnover in LGE
Council. I, I think,
um Lge Council
uh you got a bunch of new folks
up there uh that just
from experience of, of
working with them
that, that
institutional knowledge
of what ideas have been tried
before, what
things may have, may, may or
may not work how to approach
a bill, whether you want to be real
detailed or you want
to be more general and then kick
everything to rulemaking.
Um Those are things as a new
legislator. I mean,
I can tell you being on the outside, it took
me 56
years to even have
a real good understanding as
someone that was watching the process.
I couldn't imagine coming in voting
as a legislator and, and
trying to figure out the process
that, that quickly. And I
think those two factors
being a lot of
turnover in the legislature
and a lot of turnover and let Council
for good or for bad. I
mean, just people retires things
start shifting.
Um uh So
those would be the two of that I would say I don't
know if you have anything else to
add.
>> Well, TJ still may answer.
Um but I think there is a
correlation
100%
with the, the,
the turnover rate.
Um There's also
less bill introductions as
well. So
>> thank you madam chair and I
just on, on
your, on that point of
your response.
I have been there
13 years. I'm one
of those in that category
I think. Um
And so there is a lot of
institutional
knowledge
and um what
I have observed as
well is
that you're
exactly right in terms
of
newer legislators
do not
have a
because we
haven't provided to
them a good
understanding of the bills that
have been introduced
previously and
how best to build upon
those,
improve them and look
at what were the reasons
for they not
making it or
they making it in one
way and how they need to be
improved or amend
it in another way,
somehow we've got to
be able to track that
more effectively
so that we can be
more effective in what we have to
do. Thank you madam chair and
thank you very much. This is very
helpful.
>> Thank you, Representative
Lock and I have Representative
Fernandez.
>> Thank you madam chair. Thank you both for
the great presentation. The
Trujillo's good to see you
guys. So a
couple of questions
just based upon the
passage rates
and the votes for and
against. So it's
my understanding, at least
whenever I read a bill
on the floor.
It's controversial if I see no
votes on the Senate
side, which is why I usually read
every page of the bill to make sure that
it's a good bill. And then
usually a lot of no votes happen on the
house side. So do we have data
when it comes to the Senate side versus
the house side when it comes to no
votes,
madam chair
>> madam Church for answer.
Absolutely. And you can track
that. You can see the
vetting as the bill
goes to the floor and the other chamber,
you can track and see that.
Maybe it's getting more,
more vetting as it goes in the
same. The other way you
can see as you track the bill through
and track the votes you'll
see at the very last stop. If
it's in the Senate, it will get,
you know, a fair number
of increase or no votes
compared to over here in the, in
the, you know, the other
chamber pretty
much passes bipartisan.
So you'll see the vetting happening on the
second chamber
and a lot of those no votes
happening
there.
>> Thank you so much madam chair. Thank you
both. Uh So yeah, I,
I've noticed that too. It's,
it's quite interesting. I'm like, oh, that
they let that pass out of that chamber.
It's very interesting that no one said
anything. So, yeah, I would
just say to the senators
to vet the
legislation, not not madam chair,
you do a great job but you know,
all the other senators
represent Senator Souls
does a great job. But you know,
maybe the guys on my side,
maybe to read the bills a little
closer.
But madam chair, my next question
is then committee
assignments. So I know
we talked about the actual committees they're
assigned to. But do we have
data on the specific committees
that pass the most bills
through? Versus the ones who
pass it the
least amount of bills through?
And then also do we have
like primary committees
versus secondary committees?
So like consumer public
affairs, Graveyard
versus judiciary
also graveyard, but it's the last
committee. So I'm just
wondering,
>> uh,
>> well, for my bills, they're at least the
graveyard
>> madam chair members
of the committee. Representative
block
short answer is yes. And
when you actually look, look at those
data because these
tracking services
you can aggregate, start aggregating
data to be able to
figure out, you know,
we've actually taken to a point where
you can tell the,
the likelihood
by that just the committee
referrals. I mean, there's
obvious things,
um, you know, based on committee
makeup and stuff like that. But let's say you
have a non-controversial
bill,
um, that
has been part and support. You're still gonna
have issues moving it through the
process. So trying to
figure out how to play
the number of referrals and the
number of bills sitting in that committee
and knowing the,
how the
chair
person
calls bills up
and you can see those patterns
and, and the data. So yes, we've
been here for about another 30
minutes if I, if I were to break
out those grass. But yeah, it's very
fascinating to, to
look at it and you can tell
the best path based
on the best topic because, you know, you have
some overlap, right?
Um And, and
I'm just talking purely for
non-controversial bills, things that
you may have bipartisan
support or a Republican and
a Democrat on a bill, you
can see the, the sticking
points um based
on the way things are
done.
>> Ok. Thank you madam chair. Thank you so
much for that mister Trejo. So then
I guess the last question,
I totally lost my
last question.
I was focusing so much on
all the bills that have died. I'm just
like saying prayers
for them, you know, please come back.
But so, uh I
guess my last question,
lawyers, attorneys,
we, we respect lawyers and
attorneys but also
other people in different
fields. I know that we put
who these people are
currently. But have we
seen a shift in kinds of
legislation that pass
when the makeup of the chamber
has changed from
less lawyers or more
lawyers or more business
people, fewer business
people? How, how do we
track that? I know it's kind of
tricky because we said it's hard
to find what area
of expertise that person has
in the, in the workforce, but
generally have we seen a
change when it comes to that
madam chair.
>> Um I would say
yes. And
uh again, I
would take, I would use
the controversial bills as
the, as a primary example.
Um
The change is really,
if you think about a
controversial bill and how it
passes, it's really
got to have the support
of first the executive,
right? Because you don't want to go through the whole process
and then you gotta then back
to really for,
for it to be pushed
through. It has to be a
leadership priority. So I think a
lot of the
likelihood is
really what are the priorities of the
leadership in both chambers
and how they're going to navigate those bills
through because they
recognize they're gonna have
a lot of debate and
both chambers is gonna kill a lot
of time. And so yes,
so the change in
leadership
um for a while there, you had
Senator Souls knows and somebody who
has been around for a long time,
you had legislative
Ben Lujan, how long was he there? He was
there in 1520
years as the speaker,
Benny Altimari was
there forever, you
know, so those changes in
leadership,
whether they're good or bad
have a profound impact in
terms of what's moving and what and what's
not, especially
for the controversial bills,
the non-controversial bills
where you get bipartisan support
or you know, you're not getting
any, any negative votes.
Those bills
are really depending on committee referrals
and committee chairs and they're
very situation
dependent on how, you know, the
process and you move through the
process.
Um And
that's where those non-controversial
ones, that's what makes the
big difference and that's where more
of the change in legislators
themselves outside of leadership
makes a big difference for the
non-controversial ones.
>> Ok. Thank you so much madam chair. Thank
you for that. And then I,
I guess it's just interesting
to see some non-controversial bills
that do get vetoed
like the state Bread,
for example, that was unanimous
uh green, red. Is it red
and green chili month?
So I'm sure you guys
have data on that. So I'd be interested
in that. But thank you both. Thanks
to the Trujillo's for their hard work.
And thank you madam chair. That's all I
got. >> Thank you,
Representative Representative
Hernandez and I got Representative
Serena,
>> thank you madam chair and thank
you for the presentation.
Uh you know, and um
looking at the, at the
data on the
bipartisan support,
um really
proud to, to be a part of
that, that uh
you know, uh group
and, and, and just something that, you know,
that I thought about as a
as uh as we
went through our freshman orientation,
both
uh leadership from both
sides had, had
talked to all of us and
said to really try
to work, you know, through
bipartisan. And that's something
that I have always, you know, from
someone who's comes from
a, a democratic
district
in a red county,
you know, uh that
it's something that I have
always, you know, uh
looked at
ways that we can help
just improve
our, our communities
back home. My question
madam chair is
um II I
also like to slide on, on the,
on the vetoes that were
given by, by the different
governors. Uh My question,
madam chair is,
uh have
you guys also looked at the data
of the override
vetoes
that we've given?
Thank you, madam Chair.
>> Uh Yes and yes,
the, I think really the last
override to make it
all the way through was
who was it? It was under
Manny Ogun, what was the
bill
when he was? Do you remember what
that one was?
It was even? Yeah, it was,
it's been a long
time.
Yeah, it's, it's been a,
it's been a long time ago on a, on a,
on a veto override.
Um
II, I will tell you
just real quick on the vetoes
in, in general.
Um
Yeah, because I gotta go through both.
Yeah, there's been attempts
that and, and
rightfully so
on the other side didn't.
Uh
um, but going all the
way through, it's been a long time since someone's gone all
the way through. You know, the vetoes. I would
tell you this.
Uh,
and this is just kind of an
observation, I think
this
to prevent lots of
vetoes, which I think most
governors that I've talked
to don't like vetoing
stuff because it puts them in, in
really awkward situations.
So half of their,
I, I'd say this legis
this governor did a very
good job of keeping bad bills
initially from reaching her desk,
meeting her, her staff
has been effective at
being able to say, look
at, don't send that up here because of
XY or Z letting
you know ahead of time. Now, some of sometimes
it doesn't occur, sometimes the
bill moves so fast. But I
think,
um, because
you have a Democrat executive
and a democrat
legislature,
um, that communications
more going back and forth about,
don't let this come to my desk, don't let
this come to my desk. That's why I think
you see such a decrease
in the number of vetoes
by this governor as
compared to own Richardson as
an example.
>> Thank you.
Thank you, Representative
Representative Sagana.
>> Thank you. Thank you for your
presentation. The statistics
are great. A couple
of things to add, possibly
add on where you have
the governor of
the terms. Maybe
add the, the makeup of the
House and Senate, whether it's,
that might add because
the newer ones wouldn't,
don't, would like that
information. And,
um, maybe in
the, when you're pulling
out, um,
legislators with kids
under 18 versus not
above older kids
just because of responsibility
because I know people look at that as far
as being absent from the legislature
and different things like that. But that might
be something you look at because I think there's
going to be more and more
in our legislature
as we take over the
women.
Um,
and that's,
that's all I have. Just, this
is great. Thank
you.
>> Thank you. Thank you for your
presentation. And, uh,
it was very, I mean, that was
kind of, uh, something I
hadn't really heard in my
time here. I think this is
probably your first caucus
um topic that you
can take
and there will be a test on the reports.
But thank you so much for joining
us and we'll see you around
in safe travels.
Thank you. We
will
move on to
item seven
with our deputy counsel
and members. Please be
mindful of the time
so that you
can
we go to
your
retreat
or maybe some of you don't want to
go. So,
so,
oh, I can come over.
Ok, we can run
this
and welcome. Welcome, Deputy
Council.
And you may begin when I, when
you, when you're ready and I'm sure you're
familiar with the
microphone.
>> Good morning. Thank you
for having me. Thank you, madam,
chair
um committee members.
Uh My name is
Anna Samant. I'm Deputy Counsel for
impact litigation with the New
Mexico Department of
Justice.
Since January 2025.
Much of the impact litigation
division's work has focused
on protecting
the interests of the state of New
Mexico and our residents
against federal funding,
funding cuts
and agency
reorganizations that
have or would have
impaired our state
government, government's
ability to serve our
population
to date. The impact litigation
division has brought in
cooperation with other
states. 27
federal lawsuits
against federal agencies
officials submitted
numerous comment letters
concerning policy changes
that would harm New Mexico
residents and or
impair the state government's
ability to meet their needs
and multiple amicus briefs
supporting nonprofits that
provide critical support to our
communities. Our
success in obtaining court
orders, directing
the resumption of funding has
restored literally
billions of dollars to New
Mexico State and local
agencies and
community organizations
to give you a better sense
of not just the dollars
but the real world impact of
these victories. I want to highlight
a few of these
cases.
So New York versus Trump,
one of our very first lawsuits
filed on January 28th,
2025 with 22
states and the District of
Columbia challenged
a directive from the Federal
Office of Management and budget
to all federal agencies
requiring them to freeze
quote all
activities related to
obligation or disbursement
of all federal financial
assistance and
all and other
relevant agency
activities. While
MB reviewed
whether that funding
allied aligned with the
new administration's policy
preferences. So
this frees actually a applied
to all grants
loans to states
including monies that had
already been approved and
awarded to New Mexico
amounts that
we had taken into account
as being available
when the state created
and approved its budget
for 2025 and
2026.
If this freeze, which had
no end date had
gone into effect, we
would have lost
42%
of our state budget
for the fiscal year to give
you just the numbers for the fiscal
year that ended on June 30th
of this year. The state's
total budget was
$28
billion 976
million dollars
of that. Just under
half 12 billion,
53 million
came in the form of direct
aid from the federal
government.
Without the anticipated federal
funding, the state would
have run through all of its
cash reserves by the end
of May. But we
averted such a catastrophic
event because we won an
injunction in federal court
that directed the federal government to
release the money including
all $12 billion
to New Mexico plus
the billions owed to other
states that had been
frozen
elsewhere through multiple
lawsuits, challenging
the termination of federal funding
for our public schools. We
have restored just over
$50 million to
pe D
in New York versus the Department
of Education. On
March 28th,
2025
the US Department of
Education notified and
a New Mexico pe D
that we would no longer be able to
access millions of dollars
in education stabilization
funds that had been approved
and awarded to the state
through the American Rescue
Plan Act to
address the long term
effects of the
COVID-19
pandemic on K through
12 students.
The funds in question
were for homeless Children and
youth, elementary
and secondary school, emergency
relief and emergency
assistance to nonpublic
schools, all of which
covered the cost of food,
personal care items,
classroom supplies,
specialized training
for teachers and
more. On
April 10th, 16
states and the district
of Columbia filed a lawsuit
challenging the rescission of these
funds. We obtained
a preliminary injunction
making the funds available to
us again, only for
the Federal administration to
turn around and suspend the
same funds. A few weeks
later, we again
worked with our
sister agencies and the
governor's office to seek
an emergency order from the
court to reinstate
access to the funds
and the multis state coalition
one. So as of
July 1st of the roughly
$5.8
million owed to us,
we have received over
$4.5 million
and the remainder is in the
process of being
released
in California mcmahon.
A more recent lawsuit
that we had joined where
we challenged the administration's
freeze on over $6
billion of education
funding for six
programs related to English
learning and adult
education. Even
though the funding for these programs had
been set by Congress
in statute and so
therefore, cannot
be changed unilaterally
by the president or
the judiciary
or, or
any
agencies,
the US Department of Education
suspended the funds because it
simply did not believe such
programs should
exist. The
programs in question
include the migrant
education program which
supports the edu educational
needs of migratory
Children ie
students whose families
move due to seasonal
migratory
agricultural work
title three A
programs which support
instruction for English
learners and immigrant
students. It aims
to help students including
immigrant Children and youth
achieve English language
proficiencies so that they can
succeed on
standardized state
exams. The
21st century community
learning centers which were
created to
help studentss in high
poverty, low performing
schools meet academic
achievement standards,
offer a broad array
of additional services
to complement the regu regular
academic program and
offer families of
participating students
opportunities for their own
educational development.
Shortly after filing the
lawsuit and submitting our briefs
requesting a preliminary
injunction that would have directed
the federal agency to make
the funds available. The
agency itself
announced it would
release the funds including
the estimated
$44,000,776
that had been awarded to New
Mexico Ped
for the 2025
26 fiscal
year. Our work
has also restored funding for other
state agencies including the New
Mexico Department of
Transportation.
In May, we joined a lawsuit
challenging the administration's
suspension of formula
grants. Again, these are
grants where the
amount that would be allocated to
each state is set
in statute by
Congress, so cannot be
overridden by the
president or an
agency. Um
In May, we joined a lodge suit
challenging the
suspension of formula
grants that were designed to
support the building of an electric
vehicle infrastructure
as part of
um and this was carried out
under one of President
Trump's terminating
the New Green New Deal. Executive
Orders in June,
a federal court in June
to this funding freeze for
states that had submitted
evidence detailing
the impact on that
the move would have. New
Mexico was actually
one of the few such states who
had identified the
harms that we would incur
and as a result, regained
access to the $18
million that had been
allocated to
dot
In April, we joined litigation
to challenge the sudden
termination of $11
billion for emergency public
health programs from
HHS. We
obtained a court order directing the
federal government to resume provision
of this funding reinstating
$59 million
for HC and the Department
of Health
elsewhere. Litigation
against Nih's
attempted reduction in the
reimbursement for costs
associated with research
programs resulted
in the restoration of
$14 million
to unm
and then finally, our lawsuit
challenging the dismantling
of AmeriCorps reinstated
$2 million in program
and staff funding
for organizations
that had been granted
such
funding and
AmeriCorps staff
within New Mexico. So
that would be funds that didn't necessarily
go to New Mexico State
agencies but actually
flowed to
AmeriCorps,
volunteers, trainees and
staff. So
aside from ensuring that
funds awarded to us
remain available and accessible,
our federal litigation efforts
have also focused on the
stemming on stemming the
reorganization
and even wholesale elimination
of federal agencies with
whom we work in close
partnership. Why
to protect the health
of our residents
and also of
our democratic process
in February, New Mexico
with Arizona and Michigan
led a 13 state
lawsuit lawsuit to stop
Elon Musk and doss
dismantling of the federal
government. While Musk
may have left the federal government,
Doge continues to access
government databases with
information about states
about individuals
terminate federal
employees, make
payment decisions about
reimbursement to the to
the states and other
conduct that as laid out in
our constitution, only
a congressionally created
can undertake Doge.
However, was again
as a reminder created
by the president
through executive order,
that litigation remains
ongoing and our purpose
remains to ensure that our elected
officials are held accountable
when they step well beyond
their legal authority and
to make sure that this does not
happen again
in an effort to
protect the powers of state
government in a separate lawsuit
that we joined In April,
we challenged six provisions
of President Trump's
executive order
to regarding
elections on the
grounds that the president lacks
authority to impose the proposed
changes to elections law
and he intruded on congressional
authority and the traditional
power of the states
to administer elections.
We want a preliminary injunction
which remains in effect
today. Our
other notable
litigation in this category
includes challenges to prevent
the dismantling of the Department
of Health and Human Services
and to prevent mass
reductions in force across
federal agencies.
Before I end, I want to
emphasize that the impact
litigation division is not
exclusively focused on federal
litigation or filing
challenges against the federal
administration.
Since our inception, we have
been leading our litigation against
social media companies like
meta and Snapchat
for claiming that they had adopted
measures to protect Children
against trafficking and
exploitation, exploitation
and their claims that they were working
to ensure healthy use of
social media, but it
turns out that they entirely failed
to live up to those
assurances that
litigation remains
ongoing. Our attorneys
have also made it a point to
meet advocates and service
providers in the state to
hear from people who are on the
frontlines about
what our community's most pressing
needs are and how
if at all we can use
impact litigation
to meet those needs and protect
them against abusive or
deceptive business
practices.
We're doing all of
this with four
attorneys in the division
to say we are at
capacity is an
understatement.
We want to continue to
do the amazing work we are
doing, but we also want to
expand our impact.
And we actually do know that
there are people out there who
want to work for us.
We have actively reached
out to former federal
employees who
were New Mexico residents
or have other New Mexico
ties. Talked about
the work that we are doing
and interviewed folks.
Um We even have folks who are coming
out to visit, who've not lived
here, who are interested and
excited about the work that we're
building.
We want to
make sure that we are
able to follow through and
expand our
impact. So
as, as I have done in a, in
a previous hearing, I will
say, um we certainly
would appreciate
the legislature's support
in expanding our funding
so that we can continue to dig
deep and make positive
impacts for our state. Thank
you,
>> Representative
Sagano.
>> Thank you madam chair. Um
First, um thank you for your
presentation. The amount you
need to to continue.
This is how much
>> so right now
we have an
estimated
madam chair. Thank you.
Um uh Right
now we have an estimation
of $3.2
million. Um
and that would be just
for staff attorneys alone.
We do rely on investigators
and law clerks to expand our work,
but we just right now
just focused on
litigators,
>> madam chair. I'd like to bring a
motion um
to have a letter
written
and to support this
and sent to LFC
really to support the 3.2
million request
for funding to continue
litigation
>> that we have a motion by
representatives
and the second by
Representative Royalle
Mike's people.
We have any questions or
discussion about the motion
Representative block.
>> Thank you madam chair.
So I'm just wondering
when it comes to the litigation.
Is this as well
future litigation that you'd
like to put in here? Because I
it appears that there's a
lot of, a lot going on, a lot of
moving parts.
So I guess I would just ask
the good representative if
it would be everything
current, everything
that's been settled
as well as everything that is being
appealed. I'm
just trying to figure out what it is
that we're supposed to be endorsing
at this time.
>> I would believe I, I
defer to you to where
you need it,
>> madam chair. Thank you.
That's a important
question. So
believe it or not of
the litigation,
with the exception of
one where the federal
government has
filed publicly, a
joint statement with the plaintiff
states, all
of the litigation remains
pending, nothing
has settled. There are
matters that are on appeal
and I've, I've flagged
where
notwithstanding the appeal,
the reinstatement of funding
still exists.
Um The, the
request that we're making would
be to retain, hire
more lawyers which would
allow us to
both expand our
domestic work, but
also expand our capacity
to join such litigation
going
forward.
>> Got it. Ok. Thank you madam chair and
thank you for that.
We're going to vote on that
today
or are we going to
wait for the, I'd love to
see the letter before we vote
on it. >> They
believe it's just a
request.
So it would just say like
requests for
support the funding request
they have for their department.
That's all it would to
me.
Thank you madam chair. Are you,
are you ok with our there
going to be any
objection?
Let me
Oh,
so
well, yes.
Um question
about Ciana. It's not
a voting
member
who who? Because we did have
people appointed for, I don't know
who was uh
put on
there.
OK. So did
so we're going to withdraw that
motion
or you need to withdraw the
motion, >> madam
chair. I'd like to >> withdraw the motion.
Ok? And then we'll
and then
the withdraw the
second.
I will >> make the motion. But
I also have a clarifying
question where I might amend
that. >> And I
think is there any
second for that for
Representative Aviva
is a motion for second
by Representative
Hernandez and
to the request for
Representative block,
we
are,
I guess we can
um have it
drafted
and sent to,
we'll have it drafted and sent
to all the members.
But I guess the motions just to
really have it drafted and
then we can
I, no,
but I think in lieu
of um when's
our next committee meeting,
September 25th,
September 25th,
I mean, I think the votes
are there.
So we
will take a
vote if
there's any objections or do we
want to roll call or anything?
Roca?
>> Am I able to ask that
question? >> Oh, yes.
Yes. Sorry. Go ahead and clarify
your discussion on
the motion.
>> Thank you, Ajao
for being here and this
is my third favorite
department
ranking them.
>> Yes.
Yes. >> And it's so good to
see you. Thank you. And I
have one question. Um
Will there be any
funding included for
other,
for other things that
were not funded? And I'm getting
to office of the Child Advocate
where the funding was vetoed.
And I'm asking because
right now we
had a meeting and we have about
600 to 650,000
to implement that. But
in this funding
request, would you
be adding that as
well
or is this solely
for
the presentation that you
had just given
madam >> chair? Thank you and thank
you for that question. So this
funding would be just
for the type of litigation
that I described. It wouldn't go
towards the administrative cost.
Their office is going to cut for
the office of the Child Advocate.
That's separate. >> Thank
you madam chair. And I was curious
because I know that bill does
give you some leeway to
initiate litigation if
necessary. So I thought it might
be folded in, in that way,
but thank you for the clarification. I'll
keep my motion as
is
>> I have a question madam
>> chair. We >> do, we
need a quorum to
vote.
>> Thank you >> madam chair. >> Just
for a motion. I don't
know we're we're
talking about the letter and what
you're asking about >> because those
people who weren't here, they may want to
vote on the letter
and I just want to figure it out.
So
we're getting very confused,
but thank you, I
guess madam chair.
>> I mean if you want to
see,
you know what you should
see the letter first and then
decide
if
mm ok.
Bar. Yeah,
we do have a
so block. If you want to see the letter
before it's
wow,
approved. I'm not going
to say it's approved. I guess
I we can't
if we >> could madam chair, that would be
great
>> madam chair. My my recommendation
would be to continue to keep that
motion as it is. Have
it approved? Uh
the the
request to have that letter
drafted
and presented to the group
so that then to the committee
so that the committee can vote on it
at a later date. Thank
>> you, madam chair. I I
do but I also understand
what the rules. For
example, if it's during session
and we're voting on an item,
if there's not a quorum present,
you can't vote on that
item
right now. I don't see
eight voting members in
this room right now
madam chair. >> But
we
can,
>> oh, we do.
I don't think he is.
He's
gone.
That's true. Ok.
Well, I just want to make it because
I, I'm looking at my guide
rulebook here and it, it says
that there needs to be a quorum
and I'm sure I could get you to the
citation. I'd be happy
to madam
chair. I just want to
make sure we're following procedure because I would
hate to have to come back here, have
to vote again on the rules and then it
would delay the the letter.
So >> well, I
think we can actually have
it drafted and then
looked at
without,
yeah,
we can get it to you as soon as
possible with
the um so we
have to withdraw,
right? Withdraw the
motion and
then
yeah, but I think you can do
the request to have it
drafted,
withdraw your motion and then we'll
be, can I
>> withdraw my >> motion and
instead make a
request? >> Thank
you
>> through a block
with the request, >> the
request.
No, but if we're not voting
on it, then that's fine. >> It's
not like an action item, but it
can be done and
then we can vote on it or
have discussion and vote on it
the next. Thank you. Thank
you.
Ok.
Is there any questions any
more questions for our presenter
here? Deputy Council Representative
Roybal Caballero.
>> Thank you madam chair and thank you
so much for your presentation
and for purposes of this
committee, I'm really interested
in your um
in the
voter
protections
and access
of
concerns.
And the first question
that pops up is
um how
does the Department of Justice
track
and respond to federal
challenges
that could
impact our
native voter access
to polling sites,
ballot delivery
uh or language
assistance which have been
predominant
in um for the
last few months.
And we have several
elections coming up within
the next 3.5
years. And so
that's of utmost
concern to
me because it's
taken many, many
years to
open uh voter
access uh
for our native communities.
Thank you, madam
chair.
>> Thank you madam chair. Um
So it is, it is
actually our division that
is following
any type of
orders that come out
of the United
States Department of Justice,
any executive
orders and then any
resulting litigation
whether it's brought by
a city or a nonprofit
or by the federal government
against a state entity
when it comes to
both um voter
protection and
language access.
Um This is
definitely an issue
uh that and
particularly the language access
that is of
particular concern
to our office,
given both
the um
population and the needs
of the Native American community
um as well as
our constitution,
um which does acknowledge
the rights of Spanish
speakers. So this
is something we are very
watching very closely
to make sure
that we are
able to abide by
and continue to follow
our state laws
and policies when it comes
to ensuring
access to government
services, access
to health care
to the ballot
remains
unimpeded.
So that's, that is
definitely something we are, we are
very much
aware of and
in particular, have
been watching
the developments in
light of
the President's
executive order
announced about two weeks
ago to make
English the
national language of the United
States and the
resulting memo
that came out um
by us, Attorney General
Pam Bondi, kind
of explaining how
federal agencies
ought to implement
that executive order.
It includes a legal analysis
that not just
our office but many
disagree
with. Uh
And so, so yes, we
have our eyes on that.
>> Thank you madam chair. That's of
utmost um
concern uh
especially in our state
again, because we've
challenge, we've
faced those challenges.
We've been able to have
a lot of opportunities and
access open up for us.
So my last question
is um
in your constant
review and analysis of
what's going on at the federal
level. Do you see
any emerging federal
legal issues
that our native
voters and tribal
governments should be
watching in the next
few years
that could impact elections
and representation in New
Mexico? That's
again because
there have been challenges concerning
the congressional districts.
There have been challenges
concerning what you
just said, the
language access.
But also there have
been questions raised
about ballot deliveries.
But are there other
emerging issues
that we should be monitoring and
be aware of that
you are aware of?
Thank you, madam >> chair. Thank
you madam chair. Um
You know, one thing that
that has also been
publicly reported
on is related
to
um
the federal government's
inquiry into
who is and has
been voting in elections.
So New Mexico is one
of the states where our Secretary
of State received a request
for information from the federal
doj
about who
voted in the
last elections.
Now, whether such
investigation
or information
request is just
the beginning of multiple
requests, we will
see,
you know, we're, we're mindful
that that is, that is one
avenue other than
that, I think
we're watching to
see how the
challenge that we
joined to the elections.
Executive order is going
to play out.
You know, I think in, in a
nutshell, the
the nutshell version is the parts
of that order that we challenged
involved
essentially, um
the federal government reaching
into how we
administer the
elections, whether it's ballot
delivery, whether it's
verification of ID,
um those kinds of aspects that
always, always have been
just state
specific
rules and regulations
and making sure that,
you know, we are able to
continue to
use the same policies and
procedures that have been successful
for us in the past.
And then beyond that, you
know, we just keep an eye out to see
what regulations may
be proposed or policies that
come out of the federal
agencies.
>> Thank you, madam chair, that brought
up another question real
quickly.
Um
So
my concern also is
of the, the
I DS, the the
close proximity
of immigrant communities and
immigrants with
our native communities
and how all of that is being
treated right now.
But when litigation
involves
overlapping tribal
state and federal
authority, how
does the Department of
Justice
ensure
that our native voices
are not only consulted
but central to case
strategy? I
think you've expanded
your office and done
some work in that area. Can you just
briefly explain to
us how that is addressed?
>> Sure madam chair
cams. I'm I'm really glad you
asked that question because I just made
a note that this is something
I wanted to make
sure that I I made folks aware of
is here. So we do
have a fully staffed
and funded Indian affairs
division. Um And I
actually brought cards
for my two colleagues
who um staff
that division and travel all over
the state to make sure they're meeting
with stakeholders.
Um So we are in regular
communication with them.
You know, I can tell
you that as we've
watched,
um, you
know, uh orders
come out and changes
to, for instance,
environmental laws or
regulations to
kind of land use.
We are absolutely mindful
that, that overlaps with
um at the
very least tribal
interest and native people's interests,
if not actual authority.
So we go through
our liaisons to talk to
folks there.
And I, I would, you know,
I would also just
flag one thing
um in terms
of the state's
ability to bring a
lawsuit
unfortunately,
or fortunately, but based
on
decisions, court
decisions including the Supreme Court
decisions, we need to
show that the state is
harmed
kind of counterintuitively.
We cannot simply
rest our harm
on the fact that our
residents are going to
suffer. It has to
be some kind of
financial injury to the
state, which is why so many of
our lawsuits are related to
funding because
we have the ability to make that
argument and appear in court.
Another one is
harm to our
natural resources
and environment. So for
instance, should there be
some federal action,
let's say deregulation
and then we become concerned, you
know what that
deregulation of an industry
is actually going to
result in greater pollution
of our waters, the
state could bring that lawsuit
because to
the extent that
we have tribal governments
that have their own
jurisdiction because
they are an independent
sovereign.
Exactly.
We are in this
unfortunate situation
where we
can't file a lawsuit
on behalf of
the harm that would be incurred
by a sovereign nation.
So, but
you know, that said,
like I said, we have a
division that
and when we start to see
things that we
suspect
are at least issues
overlapped, we absolutely go
through them. Thank >> you. And that
was my concern, the overlapping
of that. So, thank you, madam
chair. Thank you very much for your
presentation and your thoughtful
answers. Thank you.
>> Thank you, Representative
Fernandez.
>> Thank you madam chair, the
federal government, actually,
the executive
issued a executive
order on
fast tracking
uranium
development.
And so,
um there's
a concern among
uh tribal communities
about, about
that and
there's uh
meetings um
about um
uh energy
development.
Um
Well, I'm also
um wanting
to, to ask is
madam chair. Is my, my
question is um
the, the
federal government's responsibility
to clean up the historical
contaminated
sites in New
Mexico. Um
We
are moving forward
as a, as a state
to, to, to
make an initiative.
Um would,
would your
office
uh also,
um uh is
this something that your office is,
would, would um
is aware of
or of
um the, the
responsibility of the federal government
to, to clean up
as well as
the future
uh harm, suffering
and
pollution
from the
uranium development. Thank you, madam
chair. >> Thank
you madam chair. Um
Absolutely. Uh we
are, it's something same
thing where we're following
and you know, this is kind
of other lawyers
can do a lot, but they can also do very
little. So,
um you know, watching,
we're watching what's
happening on that front.
We do speak
regularly with our congressional
delegation to get any
insight that they have
and waiting to come
for, unfortunately, or
fortunately again, for things to
come to a point where
there is a possibility
where litigation is even possible,
right? And then we can
evaluate like what makes
sense, what doesn't make sense. But in the
meantime,
um you know, it's an issue
we're watching and definitely
something that I'll make
