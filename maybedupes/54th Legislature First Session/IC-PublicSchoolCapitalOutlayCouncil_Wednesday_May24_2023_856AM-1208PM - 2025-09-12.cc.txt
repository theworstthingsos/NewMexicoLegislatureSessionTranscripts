The course.
Mr chair there are no amendments
to the agenda.
And.
Mr chair members things not.
So
Mr chair Senator.
Good morning my name is Christy
Medina the superintendent with
direct on public school district
and I'm here today to just so
you can have a face to the name
of we will be going out for a
bond with their community come
November and we work closely
with the SFA to be able to
identify those items for us
as we go out for new fund so we
I know last week you the
presented on our behalf some
informational items to you
and so when here for any
questions that you might have
that are are short term vision
for the district is that we're
able to address the facility
issues that we may have only
emergency repairs at this point
and not investing more capital
dollars into trying to upgrade
any of our facilities our hope
is then to be able to go out for
provide for a consolidated
creating pre K. campus that will
allow us to save save more money
and to be able to.
Right size our facilities there
aged and right now they're
costing quite a bit of money to
upkeep and it's becoming harder
and harder to upgrade our
facilities so we're hoping that
this is will be a good a good
fit for at tend to be able to
consolidate and right sides so I
just wanted to introduce myself
and come here today so you you
know about rat tone I have my
board members that are here with
me we have miss Kathy honey
filled in Mr Ryan Boone and I
want to say thank you for the
opportunity to be able to speak
to you and if you have any
questions I'm available.
Or.
Your.
We're hoping to go out for
blasted then we can come back
and the qualify for one of the
waivers that we would apply for.
The issue.
About ten million.
Other projects.
So our our bonding capacity
would be ten million we're still
gonna be lacking about eighty
million.
Hello to.
All of it yes thank you so.
So.
Our projects.
No.
Now.
Yes.
We we would be fully funded yes
that's right yes Sir.
These we will.
Sure.
Stellar.
Here
is.
Virtual.
It is just yeah.
Thank you I appreciate that
thank you.
She.
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you thank you for your
time.
Urgency.
The other.
Want to.
For.
Thank you Mr chairman members if
you please turn to page of your.
You're you're trying to copy or
your book we have a cave summary
that was created prior to
discussion about the this almost
school project so I'm going to
not read that item because we're
not sure what's going to happen
here today.
With that I'd like to turn to.
To the summary sheet of the
financial plan the sources and
uses.
Page.
Ten.
Given the chance to get.
From page ten
everything in FY twenty two.
In the column FY twenty two are
actuals and we're looking at FY
twenty three and FY twenty four.
So I will call out the items
that are in red we want to talk
about FY twenty for the the
capacity is going to be for two
hundred forty three million.
And then if you move down to
row fifteen we've had an
increase in the operating budget
to seven point two to reflect
the governor's increase in
salaries for state employees.
If you go down a little bit more
to
The twenty.
Twenty three you'll see the our
funds to pad for the our school
safety summits.
And then if you go to line
twenty.
Six you'll see I'm sorry twenty
five you'll see the money
included for PSP vehicle
replacement.
And then if you go down to look
at.
Row thirty nine you'll see that
hundred fifty six point one
adjustment for potential
projects in FY twenty were.
And
However Mister chair members
that does include the potential
change it we had calculated from
Los Alamos so it would really
be.
So we don't have the actual
number until after the meeting
today.
With that said Mr chair members
in question.
questions or.
Revenue.
Yes.
Some of the previous.
With.
Mr chair members.
Because they're not awarded the
act or.
Haven't gone to this committee
yet we haven't included them in
the financial plan.
The page.
There's I look at twenty four.
The.
Mr chair director Avid that is
correct.
Born here of
Our projects or programs.
Please Mr chair do and if you
look at page fourteen.
The financial plans go to the.
Twenty three if I told you will
see.
In the middle of that.
Want to see estimated standards
awards as well as estimated
systems of course.
Yes that is correct which is.
Fiscal year twenty three awards
scenario the last box.
In the middle of that box you'll
see.
Estimated standards an estimated
systems.
Of the bottom of the page.
Estimate is.
When the.
For the.
Mr chair Mr Abbey.
When we estimated these for the
bond sale we took the.
list of projects that yes that
is because he has worked with
actually and we came up with
those numbers and so these are
estimates yes.
Mmhm.
For the updated for.
Mr Chairman sticky Mr Abbey gets
adjusted every time and award is
made so we will Adelina item for
that award and we will subtract
that award from this bucket of
money.
So what parts of the
state.
Graduated from.
Mr chair Mr Abbey that is
correct.
Mr chair director Abbey when we
look at page fifty three seven
the cost still have to work out
as this one goes on state
visits.
But back in December we didn't
calculate in cost escalations
that we're seeing today.
So.
I'm.
I'm checking Director Abbey we
have to go back and look at the
list that we use to estimate was
to give you a precise answer.
Or
forces for.
But it is.
Process solutions.
Point that.
It is program.
This is the plan information.
Your
update.
I.
Lawyers well.
Changing the.
That.
Is.
Or that this provision for of.
Shop or.
Well as question.
Well chair Cherokee and I'm I'm
page fifty four you'll see that
there's a potential PSP
estimates for the state match
but again we still have to this
this is an estimate we haven't
met with the districts that
provide to the COVID this point.
The.
Was.
Mr chair members that money will
not be going out to after July
one we have to get the that that
just be nine months a number and
we plan on getting out early
this summer.
So we we don't have those
estimates yet.
Questions.
Or.
And Mr chair director Avid if I
meet the what we did with the SB
twelve is the award that now the
award announcement also served
as an invoice and acceptance
once they sent it back we will
start processing the checks.
Thank you Mr.
And I think you can come.
The prioritization.
That.
your comments in terms of
updated the financial.
As we take applicator.
She.
Mr chair then also make a few
comments so I totally agree that
we need to get these.
This money out as quickly as
possible and I'm sorry if I
missed it can you briefly
explain what is the process for
getting the safety money out is
it is it different than our
other awards process Mr chair we
spend yes it is different from
the standard systems and pre K.
awards it's a system that was
implemented implemented when we
did SB two twelve money which
was
last year so what we're doing
with this money is we don't
Monitor it like we do with the
standard systems we give them
the amount that they asked for
get in there was that they
indicate what they're going to
use it for days when they accept
the award it turns it's an
invoice Mr parks looks to see if
what they're going to use it for
is up.
Appropriate with the language
and then we received that they
sign it we sign it and that's it
used as an invoice as well and
then the money goes directly to
the district and then the follow
up is when up to head can see
what the money was spent for and
then we're going to report back
to this committee so Mister
chairman to get there's still an
application that they submit an
application for a capital
project that is look at or is
that how it's sent and they
requested they have limitations
on the amount of money they can
request so it's it's a
calculated amount based on the a
hundred million dollars
everybody gets a percentage
based on the SB nine so it's a
preset amount but nobody gets
less than fifty thousand dollars
so they don't need an
application.
Mr Chairman but the the plan
that we can do here.
That is very important to follow
up saying well what you actually
do the work of.
The financial.
To.
Items
are items that that there's.
The this is us to.
The items included will
seventeenth two thousand twenty.
Thousand twenty two.
This is the worst of these are
for services engine four to
thirty one thousand.
The certification process.
Course.
The statewide patients.
There's a revision to the
ability of our.
Mr chair I'm sorry to interrupt
you before this is approved I
need to make note that item do
we certification of SS TV's we'd
like to ask for permission to
make technical corrections
because we have some because
this did in their police Alamos
and we're not sure what they're
going to actually be.
The certification.
Action taken by the council to.
Thank you Mr chair.
Transaction.
Percentages that.
By saying us
both.
As.
I.
Mr chair members it's page fifty
one.
Good morning members.
This is an informational item to
inform you of the applications
we receive since the last PC is
the meeting as you know the
application cycle is open all
year and we are accepting pre
applications from districts at
all times since the last meeting
we received a standards based
application from Springer to
consolidate there's three
elementary school with their
middle school and high school
currently ranks number fourteen
and number nineteen.
We also have a systems based
application from Melrose
combined which is currently
ranked number sixty two for
various systems we also have a
prekindergarten application for
Sapporo to convert and renovate
the close early elementary
school to a district wide pre K.
center we are currently
reviewing and vetting these
projects and doing site visits
as needed for these standards
based in pre K. project.
as you know the SP one thirty
one local match reductions will.
Take place in July so we're
expecting the
The state match to be higher
than the local matches
as of the current.
Senator is on the next page is
an exhibit eight yes Sir.
Are these.
After the July Mr Chairman and
Mr Abbey on page fifty three I
am only showing the updated
matches for SB one thirty one so
it as of July what they will be
the school is yes thank you
correct and Mr chairman members
again the the cost on page fifty
three are from directly from the
district's application for
application letter so these
numbers are very likely to
change.
those with red text are the
three pre applications I just
mention that our new as of this
month all of those highlighted
in blue are requesting a waiver
and they will likely need to we
refer to support their local
match even with the SB one
thirty one local match
production.
On the next page on the page
fifty four.
I have
Recalculated of more
It's somewhat more justifiable
piece they estimate we're some
of the schools based on square
footage and and more accurate
dollar amounts again these won't
be finalized until we finalize
their applications the first
table on the top or the
appropriation we received and
then on the bottom I have a
handful of districts that I am
expecting pre applications from
within the near future and I
added potential cost for those
as well
so totaled his address for
standards based I'm estimating a
state match of two hundred fifty
four million dollars.
Not including waivers and again
we're expecting most of these
districts to.
The local match reductions to
support their local share.
On the following pages are the
pre applications letters
received from Springer Melrose
and support and with that I
stand for any question.
The general fund to the pro.
Also.
What is the time frame on the
state.
Thank you Mr chairman members.
Not only are the patients open
all year we're also going to be
having awards throughout the
year so our plan is to bring
those districts and potential
applications that will be ready
and ten visibly finance their
local share to the June meeting
for district presentations I
mean I'm July meeting and then
at the August meeting have
potential awards and those that
are not financially ready for
their local match or waiting for
the bonds to pass will have
those and subsequent months
throughout the year
Many districts have submitted
applications but are waiting on
their bonder or figuring out the
local share and so we're waiting
on those until they are indeed
ready.
Questions.
This question is.
This page fifty forced great it
would be easy out of call of
which would be.
December estimate.
Then you.
You know yes I want to get to
where you are too specific in
this you are all part number but
it would allow you to go back
and say in December.
Of these projects with so that's
was coming and now it's plus or
minus thirty from the budget
that that's a pretty easy way to
do it and maybe not even change
the financial plan just.
Can you keep using the same
methodology you don't change
until there's an app.
This for about four revenue but
it gives you a ballpark idea of
upside or downside so like that
why do you say you assume many
of these will require we.
Mr chairman members from all of
the districts are many of the
districts that we've spoken to
that are planning to go to fund
their maximum bonding that sees
approximately which million
dollars in there asking for full
screen consolidated projects
which will cost.
Upwards of ten plus of local
match and so they cannot support
the that local match we're also
dealing with some districts that
are starting at a very high
level match it would have.
With one of the okay.
Okay it's we're we're dealing
with several districts that are
starting at a very high level
maps of the the SP one thirty
one dropped it potentially from
a ninety four percent to is
sixty percent and they can still
only funds two million.
to one and half of the and so
we're seeing that a lot with the
small rural districts
and your streaming the total.
This yes Sir in in the
discussions were having with
districts
there if they are actively
strategizing towards their bonds
in going to full body capacity
in order to support as much as
they can in their local share
yeah thank you for that Mexico.
Thank you just a reminder we've
got the statute which has.
Progressive allowances for
waiver which or poor.
For.
War.
It allow a greater amount of
waivers then that you would have
if they had to use all their
hundred percent body this
legislative what if you go back
and look at financial one
there's only twenty left at the
end of twenty four the financial
plan.
We have provided the waivers and
and I think the street tells us
that.
The council practice of only
doing generally pretty we've
here to it very closely Google
exceptions perhaps only doing
away with one there are hundred
percent capacity the statute
allows doing away with one there
those I think but they might not
be around us of the but that's
permissible not required and I
just think when you look at.
A plan which shows no.
For some of the stuff.
Twenty million left at the end
of twenty four before we get
cost escalation which is really
hurting us and before we allow
for these waivers and then we
have to talk with the goal of
the percent funding capacity
that seems to be a priority to
do whatever they can't raise
more than their ten million
that's what we've which is.
Some point there was a desire on
the part of the legislature the
more generous but if we could I
just I'm just putting up a
plaque I don't see capacity in a
financial plan to do nice things
as opposed.
But there's another hour to.
Which is to.
This.
Look at that.
I think you're seriously I think
that.
Yes with the reduction in match
we knew that was going to
generate additional projects.
that coupled with.
Requests for waivers is
something that.
To.
Really prioritize.
Project.
Changes.
But we had available.
And and Mr chair members just a
quick comment you might note
that the other uses seems to
have increased as well on our
financial plan.
Those are.
Mr chair members like the school
safety summit.
The charter school loan fund.
So the special.
Appropriations thank you.
Mr chair if I may members kinda
want to make a comment that
that's something we need to look
at as session approaches
to realize that this isn't not
adjusted and less well the money
where people are to start with
the four in order to have coming
eight just certain legislative
initiatives to be aware of these
and committed balances at to see
how much is actually available
for the special initiatives.
as these all those balances that
we had people are are places to
fund special appropriation.
Nice.
Miss in.
It's important that we tell our
story.
Yes Mr Gannon remembers just to
let given balance is just to
keep them in fact thank you.
Right any other questions.
Yeah.
Well to.
Four one two out of state.
As.
The staff.
Thank you Mr chairman
thank you committee and Council
I think I'm going to ask for to
go to present a little bit here
in terms of working Japanese
staff and supporting school
district and then I think
superintendent guys here which
is great her school board to
talk a little bit about Los
Alamos this is actually pretty
confusing for us as a
subcommittee
in a unfortunately probably for
the superintendent as well and I
apologize for that I think we I
want to do our best to support
the school district and what
they hope for Los Alamos is
interesting because they have
multiple schools that were built
at the same time and so the
impact on that is that they have
schools that are in need of
rebuilding all at the same time
and unfortunately it's also a
matter of how do we help them
prioritize working through given
their their bonding capacity the
needs of their community that
what they have in terms of.
Resources at their disposal and
then how we can also match as a
state so we don't have a
recommendation at this point I
think what we'll do is listen to
the presentation I do think that
we all have heard new new that
from subcommittee perspective
anyway we had heard about you
earlier few months back and had
supported
We will moving forward opinion
on but to me is that the other
elementary school in white rock
also came before us and
subcommittee
there are questions in terms of
two things one is the match of
the half of the committee of the
community
what they provided to the
resources and the other question
that was also difficult for the
subcommittee is that
Pretty significant rise in cost
per square feet that we're
seeing so of that but yeah.
This is the reason we're doing
to me so first of all.
For that because
concern about.
Every one of we are still short
of what we did three months ago.
Should be your first if it's
adequately funded the sort that
out before we go a little bit.
Or else you both of them for
information so
just.
The for the committee's request
Mr chair members if we start
with Pignon it is on page
seventy eight and has director
today I want to make mentioned
this was previously funded back
in November for construction
funding.
So what is happened since
November is there's been a cost
increase for the school district
when it was originally funded it
was three hundred twenty dollars
a square foot and now has come
in at six hundred forty five
dollars a square foot.
And the district at the time had
eighty twenty match.
And when they first started
working with appears to be on
this project we talked about SB
one thirty one coming on board
and thought that the match would
change to sixty forty so they
budgeted using the sixty forty
none of us.
Now we know that the SP one
thirty one comes into effect
July one so they could afford
the project when it was sixty
forty when when we assumed it
would be because of the SP one
thirty one change but the
project is really eighty twenty
eighty percent district twenty
percent state and the increase
in cost to their request was
To cover that difference between
the increasing cost for the
district construction funding.
The current request is to cover
the increased and construction
signing up between the original
cost and what it was today so.
The.
This.
The original cost the regional
request I know it's right in
front of me but I don't have it
so Mr Mr chairman members of the
the original estimated out of
your state match would have been
four point five million based on
three twenty a square foot.
and as as we all of scene that
is increased substantially with
the current pricing that we've
received an as Miss Iglesias
just mentioned
that the district came asking
for this local match reduction
in order to keep both projects
moving.
And Mr chair I think.
To answer your question in
November of twenty twenty two
the council working thirty seven
point four million for the
construction.
Mr chair with the state match of
seven point nine million.
So that was the total project
award but the state match of
seven point nine and the
remainder under the the
district.
Just a few seems to mirror the
by the question.
Between.
Cost escalation issue.
At the age of twenty and then a
proposal to
change the less right so what's
what's the name continue project
that we will need to make about
should be subject to this cost
estimation.
Mr chair Mr Abbey
we also have in the audience the
construction manager at risk so
if we wanted to really dive into
numbers we certainly can I can
talk broad strokes cost
escalation as we all know is
it it's happening it's happening
for a number of reasons I would
say the majority the major
concerns are.
Ariel cost increases.
And cost of subcontractors it
has been increasing and we are
asked why.
New New Mexico is busy right now
there is a lot of construction
going on in in the state this is
the most cranes I've ever seen
in my life in Albuquerque and
and around the state.
And so
Our school where school
construction used to be.
kind of one of the major engines
we're now competing for
subcontractors with Netflix and
Amazon and Facebook and the like
and so our subcontractor basis
spread very thin it's very hard
for contractors to get bids from
some major subs.
because they are so busy and
that all tends to drive drive
the prices up right now.
Can we get to.
Is there a question the district
just for adjustment to the cost
of construction what is that.
Setting aside the changing the
church Mr chair of I'm somewhat
sympathetic to that even Taral.
Given the conversation we've
already heard about waivers we
start.
The director we changing all
previous awards because there is
a future statutory changes.
That's a slippery slope but by
what so that you know what to be
clear fair to divide the
question of the eight what is
the district requests breast
constructed from one Mr chair Mr
Abbey without introducing the
local match reduction what has
occurred is we the staff brought
in your own last year.
seventy five percent complete as
this as a construction manager
at risk we we have that
opportunity to award early
construction money we did that
in order for the the district
and the contractor to
prepurchase material with very
long lead items lead times.
since then they've completed the
drawings hundred percent the
construction manager that those
documents out to bid to the
major steps in between the this
is what we call the initial
guaranteed maximum price in the
final GMP the the to guarantee
maximum price we saw that
increase of about nine nine
million dollars.
which would be about a one point
nine million dollars state
increase.
From the previously awarded
seven point nine million
dollars.
Just specialist.
Mr Deputy but a lot of
confusion.
I would where the table for
discussion approving.
The cost increases with the
match twenty percent it kind of
taking this step for us you
know.
To deal with the cost of each
page there's a market out there
we know it's tough I think we
should have more discussion
about why and how to control it
but.
Think of all the conversation
for
that allows them to move their
article before because they have
a working out of the three
twenty but it's six hundred
right.
But it's not just instead of six
hundred is what.
Mr chair members six forty five
six forty five.
So thank you Mr.
So.
Some.
And Mr chairman and members if I
made the
Last last PSUC meeting we
brought forth Bluewater
elementary school in requests
and
That had a construction cost of
seven hundred and seventy three
dollars a square foot.
and we also brought at that same
time red rock in Gallup and that
one was five eighty eight a
square foot also.
I thank you yes Sir we have to
we also that are costing a
little.
it is of those figures that one
point nine he said increases
state match is actually.
A round figure.
I'm sorry Mr chair that's not
the exact figure but it's it's
close let me I can grab the real
number here.
Mr Chairman good right.
Mr chair
One million eight hundred thirty
four thousand nine hundred and
thirty six dollars.
If we're just talking about the
increase.
One eight what.
One eight three four nine three
six.
Mr chair right and that was the
difference is that.
Mister chair Mister Warniment
that is the.
Difference between the seventy
five percent initial guaranteed
maximum price and a hundred
percent guaranteed maximum price
that's a local match increase of
seven million three thirty nine
seven forty four.
It's so Mr chairman and
committee I I would like David's
recommendation I think we and
speaking through this and.
the past couple of days in the
confusion around this I do feel
like it is again like taking the
two different discrete
components of this one is
supporting the school district
in terms of prioritizing
realistically the projects for
them as well as and then helping
them leverage all of their
resources appropriately as well
as then it says second discrete
component in terms of that
increasing cost and.
If the superintendent is
comfortable in terms of the
local match and moving
the local match towards Pignon
entirely it without a waiver I
think that I would consider I I
agree with that director Avid
the
The the price per square foot is
something more that we can
consider I do think though that
it still behooves us to dig
deeper into that
The cost.
And understand it before we
actually move forward with
others so so what what I
understand is that we would that
entertain a motion to approve.
The increase in state match.
I want.
Eight three four nine three six.
For this project motions to.
No second.
Okay and then I want to district
before we.
The motion and a second.
This is the.
Discussion on select.
Thank you.
All for being here but Sir let
me introduce you to this is
twenty high I would president.
If they are construction manager
at risk for both of these
projects.
This is the to the population
they
to live this is a major part of
this deal with that the Phillies
manager Foxhoven projectors
thank you see that with our
boxes manager and she's going to
do it at the practice you have
questions about our bonding
capacity.
So I appreciate the opportunity
for the for you today and I'd
like to just if you don't mind
just give me a little bit of
history online we're here today
it was it's a great fit great to
listen to the first part of the
discussion I'm happy to say we
were it will be a hundred
percent behind it and we're at
twelve million
so those those are good things
that was a good learning
opportunity when we started
these two projects we first did
educate and specifications we
did lots of community meetings
are both schools are were in the
top one hundred and both in need
of support he significant
repairs so at that time we went
out for bonds with their
community passed a twenty
million dollar bond and devoted
a hundred percent of that a lot
of money to these two projects
so that we came before the
council and we were given the
award for both schools so then
we moved forward and initially
in our planning we expected you
to cost us about nineteen
million dollars total and she
was the classes about seventeen
million.
And incidentally cost of
increased just like crazy and so
we've been kind of adjusting we
were kind of thinking and hoping
that we would qualify for match
waiver
we understand that the lake
which didn't allow us to do that
if we had qualified for that
match waiver we would be before
you today because we would have
plenty of money to fund these
projects we are going out for
bonding again in November the
stuff over twenty twenty three.
We first we expected about for
twenty million dollar bond but
the good news is our tax base is
increasing Los Alamos is growing
so we're actually able to go out
for thirty million dollar bond
we will commit one hundred
percent of that thirty million
dollars on to these projects.
So really the other thing is for
us to interview stand here today
with us from Los Alamos County.
Because do this process and
looking at the schools we
reached out to the county one of
the feedback we had from our
community if they don't have
enough gym space in the place
together in the evenings and so
the panelists partnered with
this and committed the funding
to build a multi use much larger
Jim so in when you look at the
Pentagon plans the schools
portion it's all added below
adequacy the piece that's over
is that larger sense Jim the
county has committed the funding
to pay for that piece so
altogether we're bringing twenty
million the thirty million and
then another eleven million to
these projects but we are
finding that we would still be
slightly short for our pet match
eighty percent we've got the
change we would have been golden
that so we're trying to figure
out what kind of to the rock and
a hard place we are we are ready
to start construction next
month.
We can break ground instantly
ready to break ground opinion on
and then we would break ground
she said as soon as the bond
passes in November we have a
strong history of passing bonds
but over seventy percent so
we're confident that the
community supports these
projects as evidenced by the
strong participation from the
county and the community
members.
Both of these schools need a lot
of work they're structurally
falling apart you literally up
to do it again we had buckets
without a lot of rain almost
every classroom has multiple
buckets sitting in it I am a
little frightened of what will
happen if we can't do both of
these schools because we're
gonna have to turn around and
put so much money into keeping
them operational for kids to me
this is going to need an
entirely new group affirmatively
consent so there there's just a
lot to me so it's not ADA
compliant and so we're gonna
have to really switch gears and
take a look at in my opinion
we've already worked really hard
to get to this place that we are
ready to go with both schools I
believe at first I was a little
reluctant to use a few more I
didn't really understand it
learned a lot from David
individual often to join their
One of the advantages that I've
found is that by whom overseeing
and looking about projects
as he'll talk to you about one
of the biggest challenges are
people in Cruz and so if we have
to ship of one of these projects
and not do it we're gonna have
to wait if we're able to take a
look at it and rotate crews
between both sides we're gonna
be able to get these projects
done in a much quicker much less
expensive way in my opinion we
are prepared to move on with you
it but our preferences strongly
that we would be allowed to move
forward with both schools total
in waiver request we would be
looking at for paying on within
a match change would be
seventeen million seventeen
million seventeen million two
hundred and eighty one dollars
we would like for the council to
consider a waiver for cheese to
pretend.
that means the district
additional committee all at the
sixty one.
Thousand dollars million dollars
to both projects we would be
funding fifty five percent of
these buildings in full with the
state funding forty five
percent.
So we're also happy to talk
about other ways it any anything
you'd like to do you like I said
we've got lots of experts to
answer any questions you have
but we really we're really like
I said it's a little bit just
confused about what we will do
if we're not able to move
forward because it's very
expensive to get these buildings
operational.
Mr Chairman.
At this question to the census
superintendent you would put
you're requesting a ten million
dollar waiver for Cheney set and
what about for Pignon seventeen
seventy to eighty one.
And that amount would allow us
to do both both schools.
It over the next year and a very
timely.
Question I have is.
Of the match.
Change doesn't come to.
We're not eligible for the match
change so we'll stay at eighty
percent or will projects that
that's what they told us.
there already is in the works
that correct.
Yes so they they told us ours
will stay at the.
I see.
I do see the pathway to getting
there
so I think that's where we need
to.
In terms of seventeen million
dollar we were.
What can.
Ten and all with.
I
Chairman both on to your
question.
Mr chair superintendent I know
starkly the district haven't had
SB nine in place since I've
been.
At PED it over twenty years is
that something maybe a point
looked at imposing the district
line item with your rates go
higher than that we should clean
up you could possibly generate
probably another two million
dollars per year not including
the state match we would like to
speak to we do expect you just
to speak up.
Members.
Strategies that the costs for
the right thing and SB nine
years it is a yes we will force
of funding.
And.
Us to bond for this fall which
would be the thirty million
which would begin at a hundred
percent bonded to the cost of
about it talk to agencies so.
Really.
I get that bond passed and the
likelihood on not having the tax
rate increase on the state
ballot as the plot question
would be helping the community
to approve the bonds.
Just add to that we try to be
really strategic about what we
put in front of the community
and we've been very successful
we typically at past elections
by well over seventy percent
and had and been able to keep
tax rates the same and maximize
the bonding capacity and so in
this case we believe that going
out for the thirty million
dollar bond that we can put
fully towards these projects
would be more beneficial than
trying to have the just be up to
the line amounts which would be
much smaller and probably that
then like this but the other one
at risk in addition to that they
lost almost County and you
animal labor both intending to
go to bond this November that as
a courtesy they are withdrawing
their stepping off the ballot so
that the schools will have the
only part question on the ballot
because they want us to be able
to pass and so they will hold
there's for for another year or
go out later in the spring to in
the land that.
From percent.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the council
idea I appreciate the patience
and I'm nervous yeah I've never
been in this kind of menu before
top no not on that side but a
much smaller group
The the board has been
supportive of these bills the
whole way there is concern among
the board about this upcoming
bond it is ten million dollars
more than previous bonds and the
board through their community
connections there's fear about
that the the extra ten million
there's always that the
narrative out there that it will
increase taxes despite us doing
our best to communicate it won't
That thirty million dollars from
our perspective is not a given
it's it's something that we're
hoping for
As.
I was able to attend every every
committee meeting during these
bills and one thing that I took
away was we did not add any
bells or whistles to these these
are minimums like this it is a
minimum of what we need for our
projected population growth if
these if both of these schools
are not built both schools will
not be able to meet the
requirements for the potential
growth with the new communities
being built in Los Alamos
County.
Another another top point that
was brought up that the board.
Was appreciative of was the
safety concerns that were built
in the schools both principals
voiced how hard it is to monitor
both of those schools taking on
for your information is built
with different buildings and to
get from one building to another
it's outside the administration
building does not have a way to
monitor other buildings every
building has multiple access
points
We just agree it's a nightmare
safety wise to means that is a
unique design and although it
was very innovative in the
sixties at when it was built and
still does great for the
students today it is also not
ideal from the safety standpoint
it's got one main admin building
and two satellite buildings that
are connected but no straight
View from admin there is lack of
windows to see who's coming in
and trying from the schools
multiple exit points
from a safety standpoint the
principles during these
committee meetings apple waste
the need to change.
As stated by Jennifer guy if we
if we put every dollar we get in
the near future if everything
goes right with the bond
election
we still won't be able to meet
the needs of both of these
bills.
So this this is a.
This is a little more personal I
guess.
I came to realization
last week my son had a
nightmare.
This is the right he's he's
twelve years old this is not
normal for for him he can
program the night.
Yes No I'm I'm always emotional
on.
So he came to my bed in the
middle of the night crying here
he had a school shooting no.
I didn't go back to sleep you
end up sleeping in our bed but
what I realized was.
Was me as a father.
I'm not able to keep them safe
this this build as I was
thinking about this meeting.
This is the only way that I can
keep them safe is advocating for
the safety of the school our
schools.
I don't know what it was like
with you guys going up.
When I went to school I wasn't
worried about that I remember in
sixth grade which is what he is
now I was worried about getting
nineties because that was the
popular issue I will I wasn't.
My nightmares with the stereo
type of I I went to class and I
was in my underwear.
I didn't have nightmares about
school shootings.
It made me realize how much the
schools need to be rebuilt
because the safety was one of
the key aspects of everyone of
these committee meetings.
The they designed it so that
from the admin building you can
see all the way down the halls
on they had controlled exit and
entry points
So
As as I was sitting here
listening I I notice the the
state motto press kit Lindos
it grows as it goes
And I was thinking about how the
state is growing.
Educationally we we're putting a
lot of focus and and importance
on education I think.
It would be a disservice to
leave Los Alamos school district
behind and leave us
without the schools that we
need.
And that's all the points I have
I appreciate your time chair and
members of the council thank you
for bringing back to life.
discussion.
The second.
with sure Mr chairman I'd like
to actually hear from the person
from jeans about the difference
in cost for chimney says so
since we're looking at the
actors causing both of the
schools.
That is the maybe maybe the
biggest concern for me so we are
the increases coverage in terms
of
can you on the
increases
I think on page fifty nine.
Which which means that it's not
seven sixty five per square
feet.
I feel like
understanding the match and the
waiver request as much.
Much better now thank you
superintendent very much
but I think in terms of fiscal
responsibility.
And our role as a counsel of
despair Sanchez William have the
taxpayers understanding
this increase
and the difference between if
you introduce thank you right we
had asked for this difference in
variance in the house per square
feet between will continue on
into me start as a subcommittee
Since
that six forty five and to me
says that seven.
Sixty five percent.
and they're both in white rock
and there was some discussion
about land although I thought
well the lad hasn't really
changed.
Yes
within this amount of time and
we have heard about labor costs
but we also heard that they're
going to.
Leverage labor across the two
projects so it might be helpful
for these.
thank you an easy money get top.
I'd like to address not only
that but the entire cost of
construction if you don't mind.
The background in the I've been
building schools to change for
over thirty years and this
through the decades I've watched
the cost of construction
steadily rise
the less significant school job
I did was three screen
replacements in Farmington and
with those projects around about
two hundred twenty Bucks a
square foot okay that's kind of
what's and greeted my money so
when we we're we're these
projects and we started
collecting square foot
information from our trade
partners.
I was in shock and denial hello
hi the prices had risen just in
a few years okay I I still am to
some degree.
but not only that I'm I was
shocked by how many trade
partners we're not interested in
this project I think there's
always been a slight state
backed working in Los Alamos but
I had to beg subcontractors to
be involved in this project
okay.
just some examples.
We have stopped working you know
eleven to six
qualified subcontractors to bid
on these projects and in some
cases got one to.
hardly ever got more than three
decades K. this was actually
going to knock on doors and
asking folks we have been there
with us and bid on jobs.
So the
the cost of construction is
unimaginable but it's real at.
And there's a few things you
guys need to realize to
Just in this type houses were
priced.
We have a very significant
contingency built into the K.
eight eight percent all right
because at risk project so if
you back that eight percent out
can use really it under six our
products work for it cheeses and
in the midst of product.
So take that into consideration.
A past projects that we've
managed well we've given those
continue to stack.
Alright high school for instance
we gave well over two million
dollars back after you know of
for your project so.
We would like to anticipate that
we could give this significant
portion back but there's some
things that are driving that
high contingency basalt cost
escalations and Senator.
Now as far as the difference
between hatch committee and Pena
We did to me is a four months
after rate equipment prices have
gone up significantly in that
short of the time for.
Labor prices is gone there's
there's an actual
it will work for later for
concrete the troops for the
nation's Center yeah we are
building our our best and
brightest to be poached from
Landel from States yet from a
lot of different projects that
are going on it she's going to
keep getting worse.
So
So the cost to go up in just
that short time frame now we
also consider that we have a
slightly smaller building on the
same size complicated site
and the site amenities didn't
change from one to the other so
you do the math you put a
smaller square foot number two
eight at the same cost of
significant side it excuse that
number makes it.
More for per square.
But I think that and the
equipment costs are driving that
difference this is an open book
project you guys welcome welcome
to look at all the numbers I can
walk you through in detail and
you'll see that okay this is
this is legit.
Okay they have.
Questions and comments so in
previous meetings we've talked
about this issue of rising
costs.
In case of these projects W.
these are really
Concerning and and
And a lot of ways not really
sustainable in terms of being
able to fund all of the projects
that we want to fund and need to
find.
so we've talked about what is
the solution and of course we
now investments that have been
made and things like opportunity
scholarship in CTE will help us
build the labor force that we
need however I'm really
interested in working with our
construction partners on
identifying other solutions to
how we can bring these costs
down whether it's a different
way we're fitting projects if
we're pulling projects together
I I really feel like our
construction industry can help
us figure out a short term
solution to these things because
you know ultimately we want to
build as many projects as we can
with almost projects are
important one of them is there
are many many many others around
the state that are also.
Just as dire or even more right
so we no I would I would ask you
and your colleagues to help work
with PS that they staff to think
about how we address this
because this is every single
project that is coming in front
of us seeing very similar
increased costs and we we need
to do as much as we can with the
funding that we have and so you
know as that you think about
that within James corporation if
you have other ideas about how
we might tackle that
I think it's something that we
really need to do to be more pro
active instead of.
You know
having the sticker shock hit us
and then they okay and accepted
and not not really have a
strategy behind the dressing but
you're absolutely right
eight conversely it getting
worse this is cost
there are incredible amount of
projects that are active right
kick off we have a very finite
amount of human beings in the
workforce
People are aging out it's not
and they're not being replaced
by by younger workers.
We should be able to draw from
our neighboring states when
right here
our neighboring states are
busier than we are result of
Colorado Texas we're reaching
out to places like Oregon
Wyoming leader not
just to find people who are
willing to come here for
I I know there is brainstorming
going on
all of the contractors how are
we going to manage this work how
how do we avoid turning down you
were coming to us saying I've
got another development to build
and we have to tell you know get
in line I'm sorry we cannot do
it there's a lot of.
I think Landel insidious should
start tax credit on robots we
can do the work
I would like to be able to you
know reach out encourage folks
to join the trades because it's
not affordable career it's it's
a good and noble career having
worked in many different
capacities from labor through
you know so you have to make
it's a good career it's just
very hard to convince the the
states that that's the case.
so the restore means going on
it's it's very necessary what
you're suggesting and I do not
have solutions right now but
does need to come up with.
So.
So what.
That was I don't have.
Providing documents and make
this a little bit easier thanks
for those and then rebounded to
match up and just the backing up
of that money is comments it is
one of the plan of the.
Tensions and discussions to the
council to the you know we're
not gonna solve it them start
having some conversation getting
a little bit more knowledgeable
about it getting different
perspectives because I think
everyone's RT at this.
A priority projects in an
environment.
Thank you.
Particularly.
I was just going to say we did
bring this up a budget that we
put together was very rough and
just to bring it back to.
The reason that leads back to
base that and talked about it
that I hope that you can clearly
see this sheet that we are
committed to that local funding
I can find funds
from the county the reason some
of you may say well let's of up
my all the clients to
hold on to is that and and I
hope that you'll consider not
doing that because if that
happens then we have to put
cheese on the chip shop we would
have to start the process all
over go back up to bid for a
different fund another
contractor it would set us back
it would eliminate our ability
to do this or early order
packages of those items that
take a long lead time.
And it would make us have to go
in and do those expensive
repairs to make the building
sustainable for the kids for the
longer term so I I'm and we can
look back if you again but I
just wanted you to have a little
bit big picture that we're
absolutely committed to the
sixty one million and we
originally hoped to spend about
thirty seven so but we are we we
can do it that we just can't do
it all of these prices.
Thank
you but I would like to do at
this point is take action check
with I think there's questions
and there.
So what I just said one
question.
Did we already approved money
that should have been used to
pre purchase equipment.
Yes Sir we did on on pinion.
And can you document how much of
it you would purchase because
you you've talked about the
equipment escalations we should
be aware that some of those
escalations by prepurchasing
that what you're and we did so
on page we bought out switch
your luck will switch here
conditioning units and
structural steel so we were able
to lock in those prices plus
they had stateLee long the lead
times so we were able to void
stretching our schedule on that
project for that now keep in
mind that you didn't that we're
taking bids on that because the
design process was about four
months behind up in yet so we
haven't had the opportunity to
do that on cheese yeah so can
you we're in good shape with
some
some of the bigger ticket items
in looking at the prices.
So I I wanted one of the things
when we when we turned our
proposal for these projects back
in about a year ago
our margins three point two five
percent okay we're locked into
that
Those days are over
Nobody's going to it jobs below
five percent or less you for for
the sequel future it's just.
That your deductible we're
locked into that purple schools
that yeah I've got this
coalition of subcontractors that
I'm barely hanging on to there's
so many different opportunities
for them and if I lose them
we're gonna be started it's
we're.
That is so thank you this year
so I have a quick question so so
you mentioned that you're having
and pop on.
Dollars to.
The prices and you're like a
particular trade for you just
received.
As expected it was accepted.
The type of negotiation to try
to bring that cost down to our
it works with the school
district but let me give an
example of mechanical plumbing
and HVAC that's the biggest
ticket item on this project I
started out
going through the design process
working with you're out
construction part way through
the set you know we got to tap
we've got bigger better things
to do I switched to Hannah
construction and plumbing
heating they worked with us on
pricing things out and making
recommendations to to save money
by the time the the construction
documents for operate it
Hannibal so set I just can't do
it sorry
I really had to call it a
personal favor with that Miller
bonded.
and it is they said they would
You would expect to be able to
say Hey if you get to projects
you know can you give me a deal
that doesn't happen anymore the
reaction now is excuse me you
are you do too two projects
I'm gonna increase my price.
it makes no sense.
But that's what's happening.
so yeah we we we work with
subcontractors to provide every
every angle for keeping costs
under control and reducing
things and
this is the best we could do top
electrical I think we invited
six different electricians
we got one strong the bid the
details of your here's a message
saying we really don't want to
do this job the prices are so.
So
the contracted are blocking.
You know what just with
handshakes.
Yeah we on the drive up your on
call in case you still with me
going into this meeting are you
still on board.
So there's the potential for
cost escalation or absolutely
but I've got that covered in our
continues okay that's one of the
reasons I kept such a high
contingency we never dreamed of
having the high contingency in
the past three percent with the
backs but again we have the
situation with the no quantity
of extremely hard assault under
these these these both projects
that could get us into blasting
and and all kinds of very
expensive additional costs
and you know the approval
process publications I
anticipate having those covered
with in those.
Thank you.
Questions I think this is and
up.
I just think it's really chair
which is good for you to do long
term planning look at to
projects and ones that are
similar but there's so many
moving parts I find it
confusing.
All we were to the first project
which is already approved the
final rules concerning that.
So what you're slow down on the
first project weren't too much
for a second.
It it sticks out to me outside
of a local funding.
Image the June and we deal with
gems of this council for many
years and with.
Their standards for germs.
This council's priority is.
Is.
Yes the standards of jobs so I
just.
Thank you Mr.
That's what we have the county
can I I understand but if you're
a hard time reading your match
thank you for the work to switch
gears I will go we live in a
world where everybody has to
switch gears to deal with COVID
with supply chain constraints
with the enrollment growth with
cost inflation.
It also has some benefits we
have to talk about this but I
know it's not comfortable but
you get eight million dollars
nor the district get some state
of California for the so I just.
With that before.
Part of the conversation gets.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It chair and council members I
would also like to point out
that the the school that would
be tabled if if needed already
has to complete grades that are
forced into portables there's no
room in the actual school
building for them I would like
to point that as well.
All right so I'd like to.
What impact on the motion that's
on the table.
And that is to.
the increased cost.
Construction costs due to.
This would cost and that number
is one point eight three four
nine two six so we have a motion
and a second.
all favorable proving that
amount please indicate by saying
aye.
Close.
Motion passed.
At this point I would entertain
a motion.
If.
regarding the waiver for this.
And or the other the.
This project.
And I think that would have to
be some contingencies if we take
action today.
I guess the other option would
be to to wait involved off on
the on the waivers but I think
it's more important that the.
Well.
Let's let's see what we can.
On the waivers.
Is there a motion.
there's a.
A seventeen million dollar
request.
For the.
Your project in the ten million
dollars.
A request for.
Mr chair can I ask.
The subcommittee didn't have a
recommendation.
So what so they wanted to bring
this to full council to kind of
hash out and.
So I guess at this point and
again in this does not have the
same deep dive that course that.
And so I'm curious still there
is awards at with the with the
these waiver request because
again like those of us an
immense do not have.
The same information as
discussion that you on
we're looking for.
Awards to get us on the.
At.
Sure we have a political project
approved in about.
We revised the.
I think which is the district to
go but you've got up to project
hope for to do that come back to
say we're you know apply for.
Chorizo without talking.
And when you do that then we can
say well what are you sure our
chambers to do what you want.
That's.
The logical way to proceed with
that.
I definitely understand this.
Things that are part of the
reviews is revisiting the county
health.
The only school in the million
dollar aid to the school
district.
How do you how do you reflect of
the world's changed should we do
or whatever virtual there's a.
When you're building gems that
are above that occurs.
So I I just that's where we are
I think I would I would joke.
Lows to table the chilly so
request.
Which would have a lot of
discussion on and send it back
towards for discussion at the
next meeting were we clearly we
we don't talk about female
there's a budget for twenty.
That we can deal with forty
short of.
And just for clarification so if
we we do that we dropped the gym
Act adequacy then the eleven
million goes back to the camp
that that meeting with that
money was just there for the if
you're worried about the
questions.
Your to do list.
Help only to destruction the
state
To the other eligible for any of
the.
Just that if they are without
and it's been doing that.
There's a lot of things to be
the leader of the the what
about.
Mr chair members the the
statutes written so that all
issues that will so I believe
that the industry with the
government of.
So that was a great question.
Stewart tease about what.
It's funding I would chose to
carry to think how can they
assist.
The district in the state to
prioritize your highest
priorities and we truly needs
are nice not gonna have a lot of
conversation.
Thank you.
I had one of the things you care
so.
I want to better understand.
What is the saving of doing both
these projects at the same like
I don't want to really
understand.
I understand why the projects
need to be done I understand the
need but I need to better
understand why your approach to
doing them together is so
essential.
Because that kind of will
address director Avid points
like bill one and then.
Re evaluate the other I need to
I need to really understand why
they both have to be done now
other than that faster you have
kind of short term improvements
that need to be made like I get
that we still need that to
actually point what are those
costs what is it like you know
would these be bid together like
what is that cost savings all of
those things I feel like I don't
fully understand that
I want to fund these projects I
want to fund all these projects
that come.
To us that's the place where
we're at I am coming from and I
think all of us are but I think
just better understanding.
You know why why is this the
best approach to this and then I
think you know.
Some of the questions that other
council members have but they're
just the line or other things I
think it is helpful to to really
look at that and understand it
but you know I did I would like
for us to help you all get this
these projects and I think I
think that you know obviously
that's what this council is
charged with doing and that's
what we should be doing is
funding and moving projects
forward
so if they can can I dress the
issue of cost savings please
I wouldn't consider there being
a cost savings and doing both of
these jobs not certain things
that it's like staggered it's
more of a cost increase
employees.
should we not started on trees
and now
the cost will go up.
And that's what we're trying to
avoid it's inevitable again I
will lose my coalition of
subcontractors
and.
If we re prices for those up to
bit later
Year two you you will be a three
point two five percent margin
much higher it just be able to
re assemble a crew of of
contractors go to white rock
sure one loan school this could
be difficult
That didn't used to be the case
but this is just the reality of
the world we live in so Mister
chair you're saying that your
subcontractors you were calling
a million here have a great to
do both projects.
The ones that I was able to get
a hold yeah.
Actually they're still they're
still on board with.
So again our options are.
a motion.
On.
Pino.
Waiver request for seventeen
million maybe contingent upon
passage of the bond election in
November.
And this.
All with a motion on the.
Mr project.
For with waiver of ten million.
In two engine down passage of
the bond issues.
So the other option is we.
The most motion died for lack of
a.
We're what is.
So again it's it's on our laps
at this point to take action or
not the other option would be to
come back to the next so
subcommittee meeting and and
discuss the waivers or the other
if we don't do any today.
And
But again those are the options
available to.
Which is we need to a project
cost before we.
So choose to leave the car for.
Hello.
Hello.
The budget which is to give the
action takers.
The
table chase.
Where.
Seven four.
This is for.
Hello.
That's the appropriations
subcommittees get well that was
the.
What
was the motion again please
table
of the rest for request.
Mr chair can we ask the district
but based on this column.
And if we were to vote right now
on your waivers.
K. somewhere kind of what you're
hearing would you rather just
just go back to subcommittee get
some more information and come
back next month so our
preference is definitely that
you take action opinion on we're
ready to break ground you of
this month and so that's
important to keep everything
moving and so that's definitely
my preference and then to go
back he can do more work with
staff and subcommittee on to me
so we can do that that makes
this table to the staff which
means we'll we'll wait
and so we can do that it may not
be a long way.
And we would have to find out
because of the age I was under
the impression that you had all
of that information for two
movies that but I understand
what you're saying so yes we
would like to have at least
action opinions Mr Mr chairman.
I do want to give the full
council some other small context
about why this is part of the
full council without a
recommendation I think this is
important and also honor the
superintendent for coming here
is the school great
representation from the school
district what was confusing
about this for us the
subcommittee is the complexity
that you're hearing now as well
as the superintendent.
Posted by hundred percent waiver
that we would do the full match
we were confused by that and I
think confused by the staff
recommendation and I as well.
And so in coming up having
working with them and in this
space in the next in the past
few days it's been confusing in
terms of both projects we had
previously funded both projects
and previously funding both
projects we want to honor this
district and be able to support
them moving forward with both
projects it's not like we
haven't considered both
communitybased at the half
before at.
And then the second was and
there's a significant increase
and I it was the same thing it's
just with you
but you know I didn't understand
why there was such a significant
pop Haas increased period but
then also that discrepancy
almost a hundred dollars for to
me so much of your money
particularly if we're supposed
to get cost savings both of them
together
so I was confused by that so I
felt like understanding the
waiver understanding that cost
increases might better help us
position us to actually
addresses the full council but I
also think that if we if it
behooves us to to approach this
in terms of one school and then
the other
Our next but I'm or even having
another subcommittee meeting
sooner rather than later to
address Jimmy so that might be
who you.
What we need to do to my
question was with we propose
the.
Contingent on the want to see in
November seems like in in like
perspective that we're.
Really assuming because we're
committing.
In these funds to the project.
But what happens is that it is
the one person said that you
know upping it to thirty million
is going to cause angst I
personally was involved in the
bond issue the failed that
everybody's at all it will never
fail and if it.
And and it was
that that was a tragic thing to
be brutally honest with you and
it would seem I don't know what
the consequences would be if
that bond issue actually failed.
And you were at that point what
we're with.
That's the question I have for
the committee what we do at that
point if we take action today.
M.
Also as.
With the hope so that would give
the community an incentive.
Otherwise the the waiver request
with the way we have to be
repaid.
Or action further action down
the line but in many cases
again.
Are you having been around for.
About sixteen years long
distances
Some of the districts wanted
that contingency so that they
could some of those folders on
the.
What.
But keep looking at this chart
we've got a seventeen million
dollar we will request which
part of the state of.
At the same time the county is
spending a level proposing to
spend eleven million dollars.
It's like what's the priority
here adequacy report this budget
it's a tough deal but it's not
just.
That's how we.
This is on the budget towards
the school.
We've let's go back and look at
page she's.
Really at this point
We have a motion to table their
second.
Mr chair so let me just.
So are we are we should we first
vote on Pignon is that something
that we're where we're at that's
what it is okay the through
motion for one or the other or
and so okay so he'll restate
answer director abbey's motion a
move to table the range of
requests to promotion to the
rest of that really.
There's a desire to.
For sure the way we're a
withdrawal that but I was trying
to say yeah I don't we've got a
financial planner.
This is we have a twenty two
million dollar surplus.
For the next fiscal year in this
program.
That we're proposing a seventeen
million dollar waiver well the
community the county is offering
a level million dollars for the
job of outcomes.
So what's important question.
One person or the.
We do not approve the waiver
what does that position you
we've we have proved the
increased costs for you so you
can move forward with
construction at the new cost.
We're we're we're short you is
that the amount over we would
have to rely on the Sanchez.
We we certainly I hope fund
we I mean we do that I want to
stay here in your in your in
your packet I feel confident we
can pass this bond and so we
would be able to move forward
with getting on with the with
the approval we would not be
able to move forward with to
reset and we would have to wait
and publicly.
Hopefully another sponsor.
The two workers to work over
your students.
Next month well you Mr chairman
I wonder if that at the bond
cycle and November where you
would get thirty potentially
thirty million dollars not all
of that would necessarily go to
pay you the difference could
apply to Jimmy sat and then you
could come back for a waiver at
that point is that correct the
seventeen million we come out of
that cycle and the difference
could potentially Mr Chairman go
to.
Chinese that and then yes but we
wouldn't have our eighties our
eighty percent.
We would have to one more months
I would be able to come into the
icy but because this project
still eighty percent for the
district.
Mr Chairman actually.
As question actually has a
senator I mean it's it's your
feedbacks on.
So the way and understanding it
is.
What what is actually happening
you'll you'll have the bond
passes away and all and you have
the full funding for you have a
little bit extra so then what
happens is that we were in for
she said it just becomes twenty
seven point five it was a larger
we request for one School of
smaller waiver requests for
that's right okay.
I I think that is phone you when
and that does give it doesn't
call you back and it allows us
to revisit should be set at a
larger we were not given
details.
Correct yes we have to go back
to it we contracted most of
these requests.
At the same time it sort of
challenges the district to go
back if we thank you so other of
you know if this was the thirty
million all these two schools
yes Sir.
But it allows the county to go
back and respect as we think the
scope of the German maybe you
know what alternative to support
a smaller way we should be part
of the discussion or value
engineering of both these
projects.
You know this this thing is
going to this is our world with
the cost escalation formula
change a lot of these are coming
and it is so important to the
reason we have formed which is
we want to equitable way I
standards funding for districts
where their predictability when
you start moving into waivers
and then you're getting and what
by the county supporting that
over there.
There's another County like
McKinley County we've been down
this road before McKinley County
can't support care put their
money into gems for school
Yes so what we're doing with
Daniel was just the county
proportion here.
We have after.
Officials for.
And I don't think.
I think that what actually and I
are sort of thinking that maybe
it's a good step forward in
terms of
Moving forward without a waiver
for opinion on with the idea
that the.
Fund in the fall will support
Pignon
but then coming back
for increased waiver for to be
sent a larger weaver press fun
to be sent
at a later date with to be much
more feasible the council to
support
I wonder though a question for
the council about.
The approving the increased cost
and for to the staff so that
they can potentially move
forward with that but then at a
later date apply for the waiver.
We have the difference in cost
not.
For twenty seven.
If you approve the current.
US.
We were rated.
Right we we move forward with
this year the.
That's that's for.
Caustic.
Probably.
The more the reality cost
increases.
I think that's our biggest worry
is just it seems like a shame we
I understand you know
everybody's worries but we know
that we are happy to come back
to do with Jimmy stuff which
would have to do but it'll be at
a higher cost and so ultimately
the state is paying more we're
paying more everybody's paying
more and we're ready to proceed
at a lower cost.
All right.
Else that.
Very much.
Taking the actual date.
Okay.
Thank you for being here thank
you for walking us through this
I think we're all more
knowledgeable about it.
Well.
Please continue to work with
staffing if there's something
that we can.
consider.
To do so.
Mr.
You clarify the action that was
taken by.
Those in one motion passed.
For increased cost.
Thank you.
Mr chair can I ask clarification
that mean that subcommittees Act
and looking after the Senate
health yeah that still happens
yes.
So this is.
Back to the.
Yeah I'm sorry Mr chair
superintendent.
I and my threats are allergies
so that we will we'll work as
hard to get and her team I'm not
sure we can read that because we
won't have the eighty percent.
Of our share to bring it to you.
Show me yeah we have to stop
this.
So it'll probably be providers
right.
Mr chair I'm confused as well
because I thought what we said
was we were gonna take action on
what needed to happen for paying
on Tuesday.
And that the subcommittee was
going to go back to for the
increased costs not to wait.
And and they're able to proceed
with paying on based on that.
Okay.
It is it would use the entire
amount from the bond to be
passed okay so then I thought we
were going to go back to step
committee the lotus and
reevaluate the match we were
requests with the additional
information that we may be
lacking to be considered again
next for which.
Thirteen seventy seven to be
considered for next comes
committee meeting so I don't
understand this idea that we're
now waiting for years I don't
understand that because they
don't have.
We can get away with.
So there's not a source for the
additional.
Local match.
The entire bond or
the bond and existing funds will
be used for.
What we've you reevaluating a
waiver request for Chinese and
now are we can't do that.
The next meeting.
I'm just trying to understand
this point that we're now
waiting for years on Jimmy said
I don't understand what that I
think.
The superintendent addressed
that where we go from here.
Which of these.
And based on from what I
understand.
Inability at this point to.
To finalize those costs.
I mean increase the cost of the
additional labor troubles the.
Mr chair again I feel like we
came into this meeting without.
Clear sort of set of
understanding from so many
which.
A alignment explained in the
building understand I think
there was also the not a
recommendation from staff I
think.
I think what we're saying and I
could be wrong that we need to
go back to sept Committee
reevaluate the whole match
situation and then come back to
committee for the project.
I mean perhaps for both project
I don't know yeah they are one
of the is that what you were
understanding yes Representative
if you don't mind having to see
at the electors.
No no thank
I don't want this to be a
situation where you're coming
back in four years I think now
that that's not the intent is
yes exactly
want to fund these these
projects we want to support you
moving forward we just want to
be able to do so in a way that's
most prudent
and recognizes a realizes
What's actually happening in the
construction industry.
and that we're not flooding
something responsibly either
If we approve the increased
costs for Pignon you're able to
move forward with Pignon
somewhat now will you be able to
break grant that's the first
question so I understanding is
that with the approval for for
picking up where we have that we
will be able to break ground
will break ground this okay so
we'll proceed we can Senator Mr
chairman the second question
that is if you're able to break
ground the difference in cost
that you asked for the waiver
the seventeen million well
hopefully you'll get that with
the bond in the fall correct yes
it so the third question and Mr
chairman is
the increased cost then for
chimneys that and a potential
weaver Fortuny sat.
Can you bring that in front of
the subcommittee at our next
meeting.
Potentially I guess we could
what my understanding last that
we would if we did get plenty to
think that we're in the
construction planning process
that we would need to stop so
that let go of the cruise
because they need to get other
jobs and then we would proceed
with just being so what we can
finish that planning and and the
other the next step we could
come back one more time
certainly I'm not sure if it's
getting change I think the
longer we wait the more
expensive it's going to get
which makes the districts eighty
percent higher to four Mr
Chairman and superintendent and
staff arrangement to get is it
possible for the superintendent
to come impacts of Canadian even
have a sooner subcommittee
meeting to support and address
the situation.
I want to.
it's it's absolutely.
I would I would also.
Right.
On pass Kel Mitchell AT and have
money to support the project.
Yeah.
Yes so.
We.
Back in July was pretty much the
same numbers that we go back to
the base of with the new US.
We should it will the weather
system session in November.
In November okay so Mister
chairman superintendent so if we
wait till November then my
question is sort of similar to
Mr leach which is and that is
do you have to do what what do
you have to do to address the
conditions ensure me so that if
we wait till November to
addresses
that is the subject of those
guys will definitely have to do
some roof repairs there's
another structural stuff left
address and
I wasn't to go figure out how we
can be edited together.
We'll do that for sure and we're
happy to come back again.
I will support the idea.
But I just.
I don't want your I would
recommend the council.
Put
the onus that approach twice by
the council's.
Well for with PDO.
Get their their ways we should
look at ways we should be
looking to cash balances.
Discuss that.
You know there are things that
when we talk about labor that we
we say we want to treat.
Districts in a fair way in the
number of things we should look
at and we had so what are the
important.
The proposed match change to
information to schools that we
didn't deal with them as a
customer to do with the a
request so that we can system.
And how we find waivers across
districts again we only have.
Twenty two million about
available funding for twenty
four according to today's us you
got a seventeen million dollar
waiver request.
That that would use all of that
and I I think we already heard
this a lot of you know fill up
will be a lot of movement in
those numbers as we true up that
our forecast that you know that
whole first part of this
discussion was held workers step
from where to where be
consistent with what we've got
for no not applaud the regular
ways we think about where that's
why I want wanted to deflect the
question and I think I think
it's we we want your kids to be
safe for work.
But we want to focus on one
issue at a time I I I think it's
just important for the
welcome to the state commission.
Mr chair I I would like for us
to look at the match for paying
Pignon as well if that is going
to help both projects move
forward even though we can't
maybe approve everything that is
being requested today.
you know I would like for us to
go back and look at the match
request for four PM I'll let you
move forward we voted to
increase to approve this
increase costs.
for the work.
Get started but I I would like
for us to also look at
reconsidering the match for
paying on page in my
understanding.
Help support Jimmy said be more
viable now as well.
So two million that's the
seventeen point two eight one
million so
addition to all of like the
points I think that.
The chair of the subcommittee is
willing to meet quickly to get
some of these additional details
of information and then come
back very quickly to reconsider
the match request I would like
staff to weigh in as well
on that meant to request I don't
want to understand this twenty
two million that director Avid
is continuing to stay because I
don't understand what that means
given that I understand but I
want to know what what does that
mean exactly
and I you know I want to be
clear I don't think I know
nobody on this committee wants
to question me set out years
into the future that's not at
all the intent but we need you
to work with us to help us
figure out some of these
questions I'm confident that we
can get to a point where we feel
like you feel like you're more
supported and that both projects
have a path forward.
Should the chef.
That's one to leave the state
for the two million right that's
the thing we don't have twenty
two million I wish we did we
certainly will do will do that
and really it's really the
purpose of the maps with with
the waiver request for you was
then we put all that money into
cheese that was just to spread
across the two projects to give
people the the so we're we're
happy to come back and keep
talking.
Right thank you very much the.
Is that it was.
Because the
process for the or.
Right.
Those who.
All right.
Next I don't use.
Global world eight other
business office of broadband
expansion.
Mr chair members I don't know if
you'd like to see subcommittee
recommendation prior to me
speaking.
Sure.
Mr Chairman that thank you thank
you counsel so we the worst
subcommittee does have a
recommendation here for the
council to approve a million.
Three hundred sixty five four
hundred seventy five.
Dollars sixty one cents to the
office of broadband access and
expansion or provide for the
statewide education network
and there's more information
exited and this is contingent
however this really important
piece.
This is contingent upon the
execution of a contract with the
highest ranking offer we don't
have a contract that's fully
signed at this point so
additional information on the
potential impact on our audit.
Important in this
addition.
Thank you.
Turn over to.
Explanations Mr chair members
yes if they did go and talk to
audit advisor about the
potential
impact on PS that is based on
it.
you might mention this for the
rest of I'm sorry the possible
work required to.
Mr chair members piece staff
recommendation was not to fund
the one point eight million
dollars for equipment that
listed in director Spiegel's
request which you'll find that
in your as a fold out.
So I recommended that we did not
pay the one point eight million
because it was purchased prior
to the MO you being an ace and
purchased prior to the contract
being signed I concerns was that
the signed contract also
Provide equipment before the
contract was signed mean to
design was it made so with the
equipment the appropriate for
the final design as well as and
you not being in place we
reached out to our bond adviser
and he felt that reversing for
the equipment purchase by I
would not be an audit finding.
Mr chair members if I may.
If I understood correctly from
Representative table by the
still haven't even received some
of the equipment so.
Chairman capiz for at two OO you
receive it so I don't see how we
can reimburse if they have any
any states that equipment.
Those details can be worked out
as.
Representative.
For the district.
again but
you feel comfortable that that
that.
The the product or because of.
Mr chair members I do okay so
again we're the of those
subcommittee motion is
consistent with that.
Is
giving us
Mr chair members now.
Also we.
This year the three levels on
operations make the office from
taxes and spend your own.
As of the of the retail service
the PCP and then that you and
just the you like to say that
thank you for to to direct C. is
for going and checking on this
issue and the you still was
previous discussion about you
know why go purchase equipment
it is equipment that is generic
enough for design and you know
going back to all of the
questions on costs about how
equipment has been going up
materials have been going up
this is exactly what we ordered
the top ranked is that we want
to lock in the price
if you can bring this
information if you like to
discuss how this would affect
project timelines but might not
order it would delay the Santa
fe's won by almost a year and
that probably would cost the
schools that you probably lost
in schools in this process as
well and would further delaying
it to add additional costs so
for us it was a pretty easy
decision to go out and purchase
that equipment or set up a quote
a purchase order for that we we
ensured that the materials would
arrive on time.
Thank you thank you Jeff.
It was.
Members no questions.
The motion.
Committee which.
Have a question so on page one
hundred looking.
The revised that dissipate.
Madam chair.
Mr leach you're talking to the
by signing quest for schools so
FY twenty for funding requests
it has.
FY twenty four community.
I.
The firm
plans.
Madam chair members would
probably bring that forward.
after after to do July one so
perhaps this thank but it would
be sooner rather than later and.
Yes thank you Mr chair.
I have a question just a point
of clarification so the motion
about.
The approval is contingent on
the added which we just without
the there's no audit of finding
issue here but this other
contingent upon execution of the
contract with the high ranking
offer is that with that delay
things is that problematic or
we.
If I may
Mr chair is for the.
If the context not sign there's
no need to transfer the money so
we are in the process of
contract working with by
The current we are last my
update is on may seventeenth we
gave our comments back to the by
attorney Mister Todd Barron and
we she his current status is
that he had some questions for
the technical team to sign off
on and.
We would be ready to keep going.
Mr chair I take it thank you for
that you know I'm I just am
concerned about how long it
takes for us to get under these
contract agreements and and if
there's a lot of back and forth
and then the funding is the late
in the I just you know as much
as this process can be
streamlined
you know the the more I I'm all
for being cautious and doing
things correctly but
you know when we.
We have a lot of back and forth
I think we really delay things
which is delaying this
contractor getting them to play
and in places and and so
I just don't want that to.
To delay the overall project
It has like a.
Two German I would like to ask.
Like to at we have some sort of
a chicken and egg situation
where the funding the also
brought in with all the folder
of the purchase order for this
in the other agreements that are
related to that face once the
legislation network.
Needs to have the money in the
bank in order to issue the
yellow that is the impetus for
the transfer of the money to be
able to get the work on the way
so without the money the
transfer the contracted the peel
cannot be.
So so Mr chair I didn't know
that but it's good to know I I
just seems like so we're picking
ourselves up a bit I think and
so I and you know this
contingency I don't know how
imperative it is that it's in
the motion but if if we're
continuing to create obstacles
to contracting for this work I
don't really understand that.
Again I think things should be
done properly
yeah but you know we need to
take actions in ways where we're
helping step move forward
and not delaying the necessary.
We all we have with that that
was the the intent of us agree
to the to the transfer.
This agreement.
However I do think that we did
not give up our authority to
approve specific projects so the
as far as the council go so
where the money lies I guess is
not as important to me as we
can.
Spoke for that that this council
approved.
That's what we need to to make
sure that that occurs that we
don't slow down the process and
we.
I so Mister chair
we did for this.
Project so I guess the question
back to this point do we need to
amend the motion if they can
actually move forward with.
Getting a contractor on not
having the funding and by.
You see what I'm saying that's
what I understood yeah.
Mr chair Mariana.
Once the contract is signed we
will initiate transferring the
money.
I am part of I is not a party to
the contract administering the
contract I it's my signature
that makes a contract act so
once it's active we have a whole
process worked out with DFA have
the money will go over to
overnight so that funds can be
expended.
So if the contract is not
executed there's no need to
transfer the money.
Mr chairman I thought that
Opaleye health contract
Mr chair money out of the are
not as signature they have no
signatory authority on the
contract is between PS that they
and the woman that's why PS if
they attorneys have been
interacting with lumen Attorney.
Otherwise they would not have to
have that interaction that also
spoke with the too far to be
with.
Or is that consistent with
directives from.
Mr chair yes.
Question so yes at this point
the agreement is over at.
Act of but then
yesterday that it's back okay.
So it back.
Mr chair members I.
At the attorneys have to look at
it's back so.
Over I mean this this you get
long but the opposite I and
sent.
Is the main question is at the
rather than the process.
at this I haven't seen the
contract again with on five
seventeen but I will get back to
the office and talk to our two
attorneys that are working on
the comments that they received
yesterday and I can send in a
memo Fund note to this body.
Mr Chairman so from by
perspective all those terms and
conditions of the contract are
are fine it's really down to
syntax at this point the
technical side you know didn't
have the any comments you really
left the school so we had no
changes in the last year two
grams on our side so.
So I can Mr chair I sounds like
there's several iterations
Senator back and forth that's
going on we're gonna do another
legal review it PSS thing and
then it has to come back to the
council in the form of a member
no okay Mr chair agency for the
I thought you just might want to
update since we see something
back from the attorney yesterday
by internet I thought you might
want an update on what our next
steps are what's left.
Please wait transfer.
When we signed the contract and
stuff for the money Mr chair.
Mr chair members as soon as all
of the attorneys say okay I I it
sounds like the by attorneys on
board last I knew he was going
to get a sign off from the
technical team that they agreed
with the scope of work.
Was my final understanding that
I haven't seen anything since
whatever came back yesterday.
If you're getting the message we
all want this.
Okay Mister.
I also remember this is one of
the
contingencies was confirmation
potential impact on the product.
And there is no impact on the
who said that are audited.
Mr Chairman three the
subcommittee discussion.
I just.
A request from Mr so we.
To check on that.
Okay so it was LFC would
determine that there would not
be a new Mr chair members of the
I'm sorry I checked with the Mr
so we brought the question up
and then I checked with our
audit advisors okay.
I need a car I guess and I do
want to comment Mister chair
money on we also need the
guideline update that occurred
today the the guidelines had to
be updated to meet **** them and
could find so that's another
thing that I have the contract
up for little bit without that
approval today will incorporate
that language in the contract to
have three line to set up for
that was another piece that was
being.
Right description.
Motion to approve.
Although the paper please
indicate by saying aye hi most
of.
Just.
want to disable thank you for
reading this year and
Very difficult.
Four.
The work is counsel for the last
nine years.
All the school.
Structure is for.
The schools for the.
The rest of.
All the the work if you.
K.
The service of.
Thank you for your thank you.
Thank you Mr.
All.
Information.
What's more information.
So you're in the.
Mr chair members I believe the
only item that we have
speakers is the first one that
PED funding request for account
activity for devices and IT
support
should I get these committee
recommendation.
It's informational.
How should I proceed Mr chair.
Mr chair I can you speak up the
service request came to the
subcommittee
under the public school capital
outlay act there's ten million
dollars that's allocated or if
the council has technology
annually for the educational
technology infrastructure state
corrections
the money they're not really
application process for this
annually so we thought maybe
this is a good opportunity to
bring this request to the
council so maybe this request
could fit under that
it basically what the request is
is both force support and so
replacement of computers at the
school district level laptops
and so forth Act and basically
the frame around the Martinez
Yazzie losses.
So we we had a brief discussion
a presentation from PED
discussed this request
the subcommittee feel
comfortable approving this
request at the time based upon
the fact that there wasn't
legislative approval for that
fund but I think the to chair
the subcommittee feel that this
is something you really want to
talk about so we asked that PED
come into the presentation to
the full council so it's on
everybody's radar that if it's
you know it wasn't supported by
the subcommittee but the second
half hoping to cancel if we need
to do that department requests
you miss school for twenty quest
for maybe to the capital outlay
the I. C. I. P. process any we
we asked the the the staff to
come and make presentations.
I don't know if you want to add
anything sure Mr chairman thank
you Mr these
just two perspectives I think
from the see the chair of the
subcommittee
I think what Mr to said was
important in terms of using
dollars from the capital outlay
fund for other uses or other
purposes an iris polluted to
this earlier in terms of this
list that we have in terms of
funds that are now being used
for most of things which are
good things for the schools and
yet all of those have been moved
to legislative process sees and
have been built right and so we
didn't feel like it would be
appropriate to set precedent and
have us approve use of funds
beyond something that is not new
to gone through legislation
and and yet it the idea is also
very worthy in terms of
something that we do need to
contend with that and we I make
my recommendation to staff as
well as to the public education
department was this is something
appropriate for prescriptive to
talk about it particularly
considering legislation or if
it's something important
because we are under the lawsuit
that so why by the state all of
us together are responsible for
providing equitable access for
students and technology.
So you have a.
Presentation.
The chair members of the council
yes that PED staff connect
comment do a brief brief
presentation.
You Mr chairman members of the
committee thank you for having
us today.
You have to come before you
on the other topic is something
that's weighing on the minds of
not only PED the yeah personally
every state is correct try to
grapple with how to stay in the
game to do maybe go over time
with the special you know since
the pandemic to ensure that
students have connectivity at
home ensure they have devices
two years and and the
appropriate use of how
technology is used.
So we start start with going
over the presentation topics.
First we're going to House Bill
for one additional equity in
education act that was passed in
the legislature this session and
signed by the governor and I
really appreciate the support
that we have on all this
in issue four one really
addresses the Martinez Yazzie
court ordered but equity but it
also ensures long term
sustainability additional equity
for all students in the state so
it dresses Yazzie Martinez and
your and yet at all students.
Then the question really becomes
Y. PSC Garcia and your address
that and also want to address
here why we're thinking that
this is really urgent need that
we need to start dressing now
rather than later.
On the next page ready go to
page three.
We'll talk about the house bill
four one additional equity to
Education Act.
And the other some of the key
definitions that were involved
in this educational technology
as all applications in the
learning process.
Loading internet connectivity
general information additional
devices and received his own
vices and we're speaking
specifically laptops Chromebooks
and iPads or other type of touch
tablets.
Additional equity here is
defined yeah we have a very
brief summary here you're a real
order having the information
support and skills to facilitate
self sufficient and
collaborative learning I would
like to tell you something that
would yeah I like to your site
the entire peace on equity
that's in the act.
And I also want to thank the US
department of education in the
office of educational technology
we work closely with them on
some of these are some of the
issues that are on this and they
were gracious enough to provide
a good definition.
Additional equity means a
condition in which every learner
has the information support
Aesculus to equitably access
affordable reliable.
Hi speed internet adequate
internet enabled devices.
Digital literacy training.
Quality technical support and
evidence based applications and
content designed to facilitate
both self sufficient and
collaborative learning.
She.
To pay for.
Gregory with the Martinez Yazzie
to accord .
Order is in addition to the
existing Martinez Yazzie lawsuit
and as with your right out
lawsuit it is against the state
it's not just PED is not just
one agency is against the entire
state.
And the tech order which was
issued.
Requires a state to provide
devices connectivity and support
for families.
And it's not yet and students
and families and teachers what
also make it very clear that you
know it was yeah for the tech or
west we would addresses
immediately.
He does have a good history of
working together with yes if it
would do it and now with by to
address deficiencies.
And I will have to do a shout
out to our districts and I think
we have to districts but maybe
online this morning Santa Fe
public schools and much crucis
who are watching and the make
make some comments about the
state and local districts did
excellent job of leveraging
federal funding sources
including the emergency
connectivity program.
Welcome to the program and yes
Sir in your funding.
A whole host of other funding to
ensure the students do I have
your are connected and that you
know they do have access to
computing devices.
The downside of all this is that
they did such a good job that
you have with the federal
funding drying up.
Looking for other ways to
sustain the gains have been made
over time.
So what did we kind of PSCS in
first place.
On page five we outlined this
Mexico still statute chapter
twenty two article twenty four
I ended indication technology
infrastructure.
And you're familiar with that
the physical hardware and
services used to interconnect to
Ms teachers school districts and
school buildings necessary to
support broadband connectivity
and remote learning as
determined by the council.
And there's also Senate bill one
forty four that was passed in
twenty twenty one legislative
session allows P. C. O. C. to
support students engage in
remote learning.
Page six.
As reported by our districts in
the one hundred twenty day star
snapshot for the current school
year.
There are sixteen thousand four
and seventy five students
without a school issue device.
You may never get to learn
represent all students having
your devices local districts
have different rules for
different your priorities is one
district on the southeast for
the state that made it very
clear that they do not yep find
your devices they do not send
kids home with homework to be
done in computers hello Sir high
school.
Yeah so there's you know there's
gonna be some variations in
their I would like to get as
close to zero as possible.
Yes Representative one thing
that really struck out your
second to his.
Yeah the students don't have
school issued devices five
percent of the students are
classified as at risk.
And Albuquerque Santa Fe Los
crucis you know I've had some
conversations with your folks in
those districts we're going to
start need to be for yeah start
the session some of the devices
you know the next school year.
And you try to get a handle on
it is going to be we're working
with our policy team at PED to
do a survey to find out the
extent of the need.
It late and long term the age of
the devices.
The I have to do a shout out to
Neil weaver and.
Top right to Ryan sent people
schools it is a great study on
what it takes to make it work
and your crosswalks are here you
can't go over the chief you have
to have a good program to enable
students to be successful.
We're estimating your five
twenty four twenty five school
year is gonna probably cost yeah
Senator million dollars just you
know to replace devices and with
the year yeah and I was asked to
run some numbers by our policy
team and what we found is yeah
yeah yeah first of all talk
about the what the emergency
connectivity funded help.
we found the connections refer
to six thousand fifty six
thousand connections at a
hundred forty four almost on
forty five thousand devices
laptops.
Your I talked Campos and
happens.
And if pursuing a five hundred
dollar per device cap.
Come out to seventy two million
seven two point five million.
We are also talking about your
total in the state.
Under seventy five thousand
Chromebooks currently in use.
Almost sixty nine thousand
laptops.
And thirty five thousand have
you ever travelers and I have a
seventeen hundred tablets that
are not able.
And not all schools provide even
though the respected have
devices.
Your tour sixty three thousand
our school provided we have
students at home using their own
devices and competing with
family members for use of the
device to do their homework.
And your to an eighty thousand
of those schools looking at of
the other devices that are in
use by students whether their
provided by the district are
provided by.
The family are dedicated to the
student that leaves a lot of
students sure devices sure time
device.
And you know yeah that actually
works out to about nineteen year
over nineteen thousand share
devices.
And if we go with a full
replacement cost.
And this is a very conservative
number.
Robux laptops and apple tablets
we're closer to a hundred
seventy five million dollars to
stay in this and it's not it is
an issue that's not just in New
Mexico I have a colleague in
Eleanor they're looking at three
hundred million dollars purchase
cargo stop when district.
And Boise there are twenty four
thousand students pay for
freight for full price for all
the devices.
You're looking at a hundred
twenty four million dollars so
yeah we're being very
conservative in our estimates
and.
And once again yeah is really
about addressing the needs for
the students to continue their
education.
Moving on
to the stage eight.
This is our Vigil us and it was
in the executive budget it got
cut out to the legislative
process.
We work with forty two million.
Which include thirty million for
devices.
Eight million dollars for a
regional education cooperatives
and I have to really to shout
out to Garcia nine they're
actually up at the broadband
summit at buffalo thunder good
presentation on the work that
they're doing we have students
who are now getting real world
experience with computers.
They have two children coach is
going up to our smaller
districts hoping to to better
utilize technology in the
classroom and outside the
classroom.
There is a scholarship program
going on right now.
Seventy two cheers for the
semester I know the last I heard
they had over a hundred twenty.
Yeah applicants for the summer
session to take graduate level
courses from eastern New Mexico
university on how to integrate
technology into the classroom.
I'm really proud of the work
they've done we could not have
made the promises made without a
the north and all the REC.
And we are also asking for your
body to really start looking at
your funding potential lease
program.
There are everybody anybody
who's actually had to dispose of
equipment knows is difficult and
this can be even more difficult
when you're small district to
get all the information
presented to the state get
commission to dispose of it and
find somebody to take it.
But these programs are looking
at that are still under
development we're talking about
after two to three years the
COVID take away all the
equipment the new equipment and
it moves everything from capital
regions.
And I know that you know talking
with some states they tell me is
usually get capital that is to
get operation but Mexico with
our special our oil and gas you
know boom bust cycle here is
is just moved over to
appropriations.
And of course there were look at
car to be for districts to shout
out to by.
Kelly Schlegel she's looking at
possibly setting up a steep type
program and working legislation
and I know that our policy team
has been in contact with and
we are looking forward to seeing
how that could happen to help
support product.
So with that I stand open for
questions.
Thank you for the presentation.
Yes.
I think.
So I I actually want to follow
up on that director video
Warniment comments about
Meeting specific legislation to
appropriate these funds and.
My my feeling is and and
highlighted that in this our
point that we do have
legislation that has been passed
that directs the PSUC to spend
money on these types of means
and I will say that you know the
department did request this
money through PSS budget
request.
This didn't get funded this
legislative session
And I guess my point is and and
that's legislative process and
the legislature you know
appropriates and decides what
they want to do however I would
caution us from.
Not.
Being prudent to utilize
existing legislation and
mechanisms for funding needs.
And instead saying you got to
run a whole new separate bills
and putting it another year I
feel like we we do have
direction provided direction
that allows us to award these
types of projects.
And.
I don't really I don't
understand why we would say
still not all that existing
statute and say we need new
statute that makes a specific
appropriation so I just you know
want to caution us from taking
that approach for the kids
again creates additional steps
that are.
Necessary
so I would encourage us to to be
open and to think again about
how we can address the needs of
students.
Educators and families that are
all about supporting education
and improved improving outcomes
for kids and so you know that's
what we're charged with and I
just caution us from feeling
like we have to pass an
independent separate bill every
time you want to award funding
to things like
devices for students and.
I think that the the request
it's it's great discussion
topic I think the we do need to
look at our.
Legislation that authorizes.
Senator funds and.
A look to see what the
priorities are these are
presented any type of priority
the.
Matched the priority up with.
With the
eligible activity that we're
allowed to undertake and see
where that's.
So is the ten million the these
two years.
Presentation or somewhere is
that the money that goes to.
And so it's really not.
Yeah so I mean those are the
kinds of things we need to
explore not to certain but I
think it's a good conversation.
To.
That attitude to me what it
looks like is is is that it
prioritizing given we have four
million but we have this and
expenditures as well so is is
revisiting that amount million
to the need to it is the
priority of the legislature to
the debate increase that amount
in order to provide okay
that's helpful to know that we
would be they would be.
Looking to access that same part
of money.
So there's that but I'll go back
to that same sort of.
I DO in terms of
you know we can't use.
R. the full sort of scope that
this council has in terms of
making a point that we that our
justification or the reason why
we would do it is because we
need to separate legislation
specific for this but I guess
that that was my point I'm not
saying that we should fund this
or take money away from a fight
that's really even on the table
it was just more of like a
response to director put it one
of them in that
I think we should really think
about how do we use the vehicles
and that forty that we have are
ready to to move things forward
whatever that case may be
whether it's this or something
and it seems like now that we're
looking at the.
Have set aside.
This would be a good way to do
it as well the process that.
Process but again the these are
much needed I think you are
I was under the impression that
there was already a frontier was
providing all of this all of
these laptops and computers for
kids at this the Yazzie Martinez
again.
In the state that has.
Take that.
I thought so.
So Mister chair we the the.
Public Department along with do
it and many other the early
childhood agency higher at kind
of a cross agency effort did
utilize the federal funding that
was available through the SEC
and we were one of the top
states in the nation in terms of
our ability to drive down that
federal money that was done to
the fullest I think possible
levels
However devices continue need to
be upgraded and replaced and so
it's not a one time deal it's
something that the state is
going to have to really continue
to make these investments
moving forward I can tell you
all three of my kids the
majority of their work they get
is on a computer
my middle school student cannot
do work at home without their
computer fast and I've been told
that what has to be done on the
computer and so it's just that
these are the environments that
our kids are learning and I
think that you know we have to
make sure we're aware that these
devices are on the way our
schools are prioritizing
educating our kids.
This is all being done under the
auspices of house bill four we.
Of course is this sort of the
mandate seven.
Which is because.
Yes it is was there any funding
provided with for the.
So Mister chair house bill four
oh one they were amending an
existing act they were updating
this act has been in place and
it was very out of date so the
act needed to be updated anyway
the funding associated with
supporting.
Devices was in the PSS budget
request on the from the
executive and that did not get
funded through the collections
that was ten million funded for
it to committee staff from the
for for.
Was last year.
Issue.
Need to.
So Mr chair and perspective
again from that point of
committee going back to what the
speech that we have a
publication essentially ten
million dollars and Senate bill
one thirty four of which that
was attacked attached to really
does specify the send largely
however there are other things
in terms of revisiting this us I
feel like it's really cool to
get students involved not just.
Not just the light of the
council itself I do hear you the
study of though in terms of like
what is that I would like to
sort of to be involved in terms
of the leveraging that fund
because the request be pushed
beyond ten million dollars when
we came towards the product.
Session of the.
Have the ability to provide
funding yeah something that was
already allocated for that I do
feel that I already gave is
feedback to the team which I
think they'll take back and
maybe to think about in terms of
the state of the long term when
we look at this type of funding
you want to consider a couple of
things one is what is the
timeline it's a continuation
that sort of a summary of all of
the dollars and this.
Include dollars eight dollars
eight dollars what the staff is
talking about this to get us a
better picture of what currently
exists and why forty two million
is an appropriate about would be
very helpful I understand and
hear about the crises but I
wonder about eight million
dollars to the REC given there's
only a hundred and twenty
teachers that it's serving cross
the state that's a pretty
hi chairman.
Of that dollar amount right I
also feel like it behooves us to
really be deeply about
instructional materials
relationship between the amount
of money that's going in the SCG
to support structure the turtles
and its relationship to the
technology here because for more
as we get open sourced
instructional materials that is
a really important piece to
connect to your.
Funding to districts
so I I think getting back to the
Department
There was a fifteen.
That's right increase that's
right through.
Just trying to.
That's right.
So.
Thank you.
excuse me.
chair and members of the
committee I merry way and the
yeah you Public Education
Department and I'd just like to
take a moment to stress the
immediacy of the need for the
replacement of school issued
devices that we already issue so
when we started the pandemic we
utilized federal funds and.
Legislative forty two percent of
the devices and now so so we're
now down review tracking it
we're now down to only five
percent of students don't have a
device as soon as the school
year starts those originally
purchased devices will no longer
be available and we now are
expecting that we will no longer
be at five percent we're going
to inch back up for that forty
seven percent that's
unacceptable for that for that
Yazzie Martinez tech order which
indicates that the dependence
shall immediately determined
which at risk students and
teachers.
Do not have a dedicated digital
device immediately private
provide one or ensure that one
is provided each of these
students and their teachers
dependence shell between this
information and the costs of
providing these devices from the
school each school district
which we've done and we've made
incredible progress but that's
not a one shot time shop we're
going to take those devices back
and that's our fear for the
beginning of the next school
year that's why we were urgently
trying to.
Receive that funding over the
last provided they did session
that's where our all of our
estimates were based on we
didn't get that funding and now
we're sitting here trying to
figure out how to help out the
disk.
Explaining in.
I will.
That tops.
If they were purchased three
years ago they will be out of
flight end of life.
They can't be used if their end
of life no longer supported by
the manufacturer because it a
student uses that it's subject
to security issues and then they
can go and plug into their
school network because they
could potentially impact our
school.
So we are estimate is based on
conservative estimates twenty
percent replacement not the full
forty five percent twenty
percent replacement in one year
and we're using five hundred
dollars
a device which is low if you're
looking at the range of devices
that John was talking about.
So thirty one million dollars is
a low conservative.
The support that we asked for is
important because families and
students using devices in their
home the the place to call and
ask for help it's a huge burden
to put that on the screen
district that's why we should
have the REC they have a network
distributed throughout the state
that already next to those
students so it's a and it
provides a work study program so
it's it's.
If we designed.
To be local and to have that the
help where it's needed most
right in those.
There are many districts that.
Are you Mr chair I will ensure
that I really proud of the work
the REC it done is not just the
scholarship program but the
student help desk you know the
students are getting hands on
here.
Is working on laptops and
Chromebooks there yeah there's a
whole range of options here here
in yeah and I'm really I'm
really happy to see that it's
we're dressing both Anna's by
dressing students.
Las families families and
teachers and.
And administrators.
You really are.
You're helping them your.
Right right ways that should
have been in my opinion prices
in general go but we're making
progress I think we you know I
think Garcia to do the job
the inner city as I talk with
people around the state
you are here what keeps kids
here and having them engaged and
tech support here is really good
way to build that into our
capacity and large capacity for
state.
Yes I'm really happy what
they've done you know so I'm
here there is a yes I'm yeah but
they really.
Good job and also the public
interest research group US
department the US public
interest research group the
study they found that a lot of
Chromebooks are really not
repairable.
Yeah early on the pandemic yeah
you got what you can get on the
cheap love them you can get a
decent for them anymore as far
as repairing them goes yeah
model this year in two years you
may not be able to do something
like replaced the cover on the
computer because you know what
had happened we did not have to
have you can't they're not parts
are not interchangeable it about
nine I don't know how successful
they're going to be has
legislation your requires that
you're eighteen requirements all
to school districts have to be
repairable you know they called
right to repair act.
Mr chair so you know again this
is information all we don't have
the funding to to fund this I
think that.
It's important for this council
should be aware of these capital
needs and to think about you
know how can we work to support
the LEDs ten and the state
agencies to make sure that that
this very important need is met
and funded in the ways that we
can fund it but again I I think
it's helpful to have the
information although we don't we
don't have the funding to
actually award this request so I
you know I think it's helpful to
for us all to hear about this
capital needs.
Thank you thank you for being
here are there any closing
comments or questions.
Thank you and it will be talking
about this sure.
Of the two were where we can fit
in she that.
Thank you.
Mr chair members I see just the
rest of the informational items
might be.
Thank you could I read at your
leisure.
The.
The person leisure time.
Please.
Thank you all for.
For discussion today was.
Thank you.
You know what these are these is
reasonable.
Thanks to his increased costs
that we believe.
To get a good handle on it.
This is.
Allies press.
Work as well.
Thank you for that at the.
I should say that
Something about David Abbey
select.
Just.
Start.
