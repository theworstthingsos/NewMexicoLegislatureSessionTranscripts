Cor of New Mexico,
Colfax, Curry Harding, Qua
San Miguel and Union Counties.
It's not very populated at where
I live. So I'm
happy to be
here.
>> Ok. We'll go over to Representative
De La
Cruz.
>> Good morning chairman, vice
chair, Art de La Cruz House
District 12. It's a pleasure
to be here. My
wife is ac, a proud
CNN board member and just
loves serving Tracy.
And so um I'm
not, you're not too far from my
district, which is just
west of here in the South Valley.
Thank you.
>> Good morning, Mr Chairman, a
state representative John Blockhouse
District 51 from
beautiful Otero County in the
51st district. Uh We're
nestled right, right in the foothills
of the Sacramento Mountains, right in the
Tularosa Basin. Blessed
to be here. Thank
you.
>> Government. Good
morning. Um I'm
uh without a name tag,
but that's because I'm not
usually a member of this committee
but interested in what they're
doing today. Uh
I'm Marian Matthews. I
represent district
27 in the far
northeast Hes of Albuquerque
and
uh in a, well,
now I have a name. Thank
you. Um
uh and
uh let's see what was I gonna say
and, and I was an
instructor in the business
department at CNM for many
years and
uh C and M has a wonderful
place in my heart forever
and its students particularly.
Thank
you.
>> Ok. Thank you. Uh to
the committee, come back to our vice chair
here momentarily. Um Sabina,
would you mind introducing the
staff that's here with you today.
Our committee director, Sabina
Gaynor,
>> Mr, chair members of the committee.
I'm Sabina Gaynor. I'm a staff
attorney with the legislative Council
service. I'm assisted by Mark
Edwards and Clinton Turner
and Roberto
Sanchez.
Thank you. >> Ok.
Thank you, madam, vice
chair.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I'm
State Representative Joy
Garrett, Northwest
Albuquerque. Five minutes
from CNM West
and the Petroglyph National Monument
is in my district. I just
have to give a shout out for
CNM for
participating in Vince
Gilligan's uh
sci fi.
They've been filming maybe here
but out there they
created the ST Joan
Medical Center which
threw me for a loop
wondering if CNM,
why they had sacrificed half
of their campus for a new
medical center, although
impressed that there was a medical center.
Anyway, it's, it's for the
purpose of film, so you'll
see it soon.
Thank you
>> and thank you vice chair.
And I think he just sat down
the newest person to
play 007, James
Bond. Representative RAAS.
Can you introduce yourself,
please?
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I
did uh dress up
to give that impression.
But I'm just a funeral
record and
this is my uniform.
So anyway, thank you for
having us here. It was a nice,
uh, drive up here this morning
from district 39
down in Silver City.
And so I'm glad to be here,
uh, left early this
morning and just
barely made it on time. Thank
you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you. And I know you just sat down,
so I appreciate you jumping right in.
I know that Senator Gallegos is
somewhere in the building. I saw him earlier.
We'll have him introduce himself when he comes
back. I'm Senator Michael
Padilla, chairman of this committee,
also of the senate majority whip.
I've been in the Senate about 12
years, chaired the Science and Tech
committee for 10 years and, and
now I'm, I'm doing this where the real money
is, which is really exciting so we can get some
really big things done for this
institution as well as
others.
Have always enjoyed working with you
madam President. I
have to say that I am
always just blown away
with everything you have accomplished
in the period that you've been here. I know
there was a lot leading up to, but
you and your, your governing
board are doing a phenomenal
job of, of taking this
institution into the
30th century or wherever it
is, whatever you're planning, I can only imagine what
you're planning next. So I'm going to
hand it over to you if you wouldn't mind giving
us some opening remarks and let us know
about the school.
>> Well, thank you so much for being
here and we're so pleased to
welcome you uh at any of our
campuses, but particularly this
one and particularly in this facility,
which is um
is the home to our catering and
brewing academy. Uh
again, reflects many years
of partnerships with our industry
partners to shape
the programming and to expand our
programming uh here.
And of course, uh this
facility was funded by local
um our local mill levy. So we
really, again, always appreciate
the support of our local voters
to be here. Um
So thank you and again. So my name
is Tracy Hartz. I'm president of
C and M, I'm the sixth president of
C and M and I've been in this
role uh for
about five years,
which is more and a half years.
Surprising. So, yes,
it, it's very exciting. And
again, I work for a, a seven
memberm elected uh governing
board, really proud of the work
that they do and the leadership they do.
Um As Representative De
La Cruz mentioned, so
again, we really appreciate you being
here and I'm really excited about the
agenda that you have
uh because it really reflects
a part of the college that you may
not know about um
as much. And you're gonna hear about that in
just a minute. You may
know that CNM educates
or trains about 25,000
individuals a year. We're the largest
undergraduate institution in the
state. We have about 200
programs including our workforce
training and our academic programs
or degree programs. But I want
to say that they're seamless in how
they as
Representative Matthews noted and Representative
PDO and Representative
Garrett, all noted
really are,
are educating and training
individuals to participate
in good wage jobs
to start on their path or to
restart a path in
one of our,
our important industries. And
certainly this facility represents that
today.
So again, we want to really thank you and
welcome you to, to our
campus in this particular
building. Um
What I wanted to highlight briefly
is that CNM,
as I mentioned, we have a number of
academic programs and training but
what is relevant to, I
think your work and the agenda you
have today? Uh
I'd really like to highlight the entrepreneurial
support uh
that we give in our community.
Um Because that is
uh I think as you know, we
want to keep people in the state, we want
to provide really strong
jobs and opportunities
for every member of our
community to do
that is, is to grow and support
our local business and our small business
and attract other businesses here to our
state. So I wanted to highlight
a few ways we do that here at
C and M and particularly
C and M ingenuity, which is a
501 C three.
It's an IRS designation
nonprofit organization,
but also it's founded under the
University Research Park Act.
And so that allows us
to undertake a number
of business support, a
activities that the
college itself can't do
easily just
because of how we're structured and what our
mission is. But the research
product entity really allows
us to grow,
develop businesses,
to help us use our
assets that again,
local taxpayers and the state
support. But to really help
us use our assets in ways that
grow the economy here in New
Mexico and develop the workforce
here in New Mexico.
One way we do that
um
like many community colleges
in your community, we have aligned
all of our business support efforts
under ingenuity. As
I mentioned, it's our 501 C three
Research Park Act entity.
So we have our small Business
Development Center under
ingenuity. We have
score and other business
support organizations that
are working with
ingenuity to leverage
everything from business plan
development to
capitalization
and really where that work comes
in and and really has matured over the
last couple of years is
with our venture capital work
and developing our entrepreneurs.
A few items I want to highlight and
then I'd really like TJ
Cook to describe some of them
in the latest one in detail
because again, it's about growing our
businesses. Um but we
do have a venture fund.
Um And I will say that is groundbreaking
work for a community
college. As
I travel the country, there
aren't many community colleges. As a matter
of fact, I haven't met one or leaders
of one who have
who when they
support local business, they actually
help raise and develop
leaders but raise capital for small
business in a way that's nontraditional
and we do that. So we do have
a venture fund. It's a private fund
managed by ingenuity and
that aligns certainly with all of our
entrepreneurial activities and
partnership. The goal for our
current fund, it be our second
fund is $15 million.
And again, we'll invest in New
Mexico Based companies that can help
spur growth in key industries.
You may have heard from some of the
companies who we've invested in
and, and have supported over
time including the Electric
Playhouse, NTX
Bio, which is a biotechnology
company and uh Crossbow
Systems, which is a space technology
company. Again, we
support businesses, particularly
those in the areas and the industries
that the economic
development department that are
local economic development
organization area
and others have said these are
the areas we want to grow in our
region and our state. And
so we make sure that we again
put our resources in that area in
those areas.
We also have
been uh key
leaders and
supporters of a number of other
efforts around aerospace. And I
want to highlight the new Mexico Space
Valley Coalition. You
may have remembered that
CNM uh the CNM
led New Mexico State Space
Valley Coalition earned half a million
dollars in a planning grant
uh and was a finalist for
the $100 million build back
better grant from the US Economic
Development Administration.
So, while we were a finalist and
we received planning money, what's been
important is that, that
those key, that key work in those
partnerships led us
to apply for
um and again, be a finalist
for other um other
aerospace and space related
uh grants. But I want to remind
you that we always work in partnership
and my governing board
ensures that I work
in partnership with other organizations,
um schools,
businesses and,
and other leaders in
our region and our state to
advance the state in this
coalition. It's very important that
it's C and M, it's ingenuity, it's the
city, it's the
city of Albuquerque. It's the New
Mexico Trade Alliance, it's New
Space, Nexus and Spaceport
of America. And those are a few,
just a few of the partners who we work
with.
I also want to highlight that we
work with. Um we have
two events primarily where we're
serving airspace and
um have other business
pitch ideas. One is the Hyperspace
Challenge. So we
work very closely in partnership with the
Air Force research labs
and the Us Space Force to
manage what's called the Hyperspace
Challenge. It's a
business accelerator that's designed
to increase collaboration among
start-ups, uh university
research teams to
date and this is an important
piece of information. But to date, we've
had five cohorts and
67 companies have
participated in this.
64% of
those participants have won
more than $600
million in government contracts
and nearly $220
million in venture capital
investments. So what does
that mean? Again, it means we are
supporting businesses, we are bringing
them here, we are growing our
own and also we're aligning
our workforce training programs with
those businesses coming in. So I
would say we're full C
and M and ingenuity is a full stop shop.
Uh But again, I want to highlight the
Hyperspace Challenge you
may have known recently in other parts of
the state that we've also participated
and led the adventure pitch
where we're supporting
um business and
entrepreneurial develop with an
outdoor recreation
pitch again, a priority of the
state. And then also
with our ski lift pitch which also
supports small business.
Um with that I really want
to highlight and welcome
TJ Cook also on the
agenda who can talk a little bit about our
entrepreneur and residents program
because this is really the next phase
of the work that we can do
to help develop
entrepreneurs. To dare.
I say stop a brain drain
and really keep people in,
in the best and brightest here in New
Mexico to help create those
businesses and jobs that
will help all of us uh
Excel. So we would talk
about that.
>> Thank you, President Hartzler.
Uh Thank you, Mr Chair
uh madam, vice chair and members
of the committee.
Um The
Entrepreneur and Development
pilot program
um is funded
by legislative appropriation
junior appropriation
uh from two sessions
ago. Uh
many uh representatives
and senators supported
that and it's a
$315,000
appropriation.
Um Want to just
describe what we're going to do with
that and the vision for that
program
um to couch
it in context of what President
Hartzel was just talking about.
We have a lot of programs of
support people
who are already
entrepreneurs, people
who have taken the risk,
got the idea. And
now they need X,
they need funding, they need
um uh
talent. Uh they
need connectivity to
customers.
The entrepreneur and development
program takes a step
back from that. Um
And is looking around the
state and saying there are a
number of New
Mexicans who
are at higher ed
institutions, they're in the
community, but
they don't have a couple of things that would
allow them to take that leap.
They don't have social
capital and
they don't have actual
capital.
So what they end up doing
is taking
a job.
Um And that's OK. Some,
some people can take a job and
then once they get experience, then
they, they
have a little bit of experience
and they could start a company.
But for those who know they want
to be an entrepreneur, they, they
just don't have family members
or people who could
help fund them or support
them. We want
this program
uh around the state to
fill that gap and say
we got you come into
the entrepreneur development program.
And over the next 6 to
18 months, we
will train you to be a professional
entrepreneur. And
then um
we model out some
percentage would start their own
company, some percentage would join
another new Mexico start up
that already exists and
thereby we've create more
talent in the entrepreneurial
ecosystem.
So what we're doing is
a sixmonth pilot that
will actually begin next
month and go through
January of
2025.
and we're going to select four
individuals. Um
Mostly because of the, the
limited funding we have,
we're going to focus in the,
in the central New Mexico
area. Uh We really
believe face to face interactions
as part of this program is really
important. If somebody
from uh your districts
is a born entrepreneur
and they might participate,
they just need to be able to be in Albuquerque
for these six months.
But
um the belief
is that we can build
a uh ultimately
a venture studio by
investing in
entrepreneurs and development
to run the operations
of that studio with
strong program support
team and a really
sound venture building
playbook.
Um
So in short, think
of it as a boot camp for
entrepreneurs, much like
we have boot camps for
coding talent.
Um
The best experience for entrepreneurs
is doing entrepreneurship,
this is the closest
approximation.
Uh And for those who
don't have the social capital or the
financial capital,
we think we're going to fill a gap
and keep more amazing
talent here in New Mexico
accordingly.
Um Just
touch on a couple of things
here.
We have partnerships
with um several
colleges around the
state. Uh once we're
able to scale this program,
so the six
months and the four
entrepreneurs and development we
cultivate, we hope
to have data from that that
um
empowers uh
financial support to
scale this to 20
entrepreneurs in development
throughout the state
uh on a annual
basis.
Um So
your, your nieces, nephews,
grandchildren, uh
This would be one other
tool in the tool belt
um that
they might want to apply
to as they're thinking about
graduation. If
they're maybe not even college
bound, they just want to get into the
mix. We hope this is
a tool in New Mexico's Tool
belt to uh
to get them in the game
here rather than seeing
them go off to Silicon Valley,
to Denver, to Austin,
things like that.
Um As
part of that, we're gonna partner
um very intently.
So,
um as
of right now, we have San Juan
Community College, Santa
Fe Community College
and Southeast New Mexico
uh college
signed up. Um
And that means that they're going to
have a champion
at their institution
who helps
identify and cultivate
an E ID from that institution
to join the
cohort. Um
So, if you can imagine 20
uh individuals who want
to be entrepreneurs in a
cohort at any given point
drawn from around the state,
most likely in a hybrid
modality where we're
traveling around, they're coming to
Albuquerque, but
they're, they're building
businesses where they live.
Um It's really
exciting and obviously
we want more institutions
uh four years,
two years, um
community organizations and
the like at
scale.
Um As
President Hartzler said about
where the fund
invests and where our
hyperspace challenges around
aerospace. We
want this program to be aligned
to the state's economic development
goals as well. So we're
cultivating entrepreneurs who
can go on to found an aerospace
company, who can go on to found
an agriculture company
who can go on to found a
cybersecurity company.
So um
really excited about it.
Um This is
kind of a, a prequel to
all the other programs we currently
do and we think
by really investing
in our own talent
before they're
able to have a
track record, we're gonna
provide them that track record that
gets more entrepreneurs
active in New Mexico.
Really excited about the program. Thank
you, President Hartzler,
members of the committee
>> that we'll be glad to take any questions.
But we're again, we really welcome
you. We're glad you're here.
Um And we look forward to
uh the rest of your day and the
agenda.
>> Thank you madam president
and thank you TJ very
much. I'm just going to have
some. Hello, we'll
do a quick intro and then we'll move
on to some questions.
Representative Lujan,
>> thank you, Mr Chair, uh Representative
Terol Luhan
and my daughter
Olive uh here
from Santa Fe House District
48. Happy to be here.
Thank you.
>> Thank you very much and welcome Olive.
There's some
bagels and other really
great things over there and juices
and waters and all kinds of things make
yourself at home. Uh We'll
go to some questions. We have a
Representative
Terrazas.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Uh Thank you very much
for your presentation.
Uh Mrs Harper
and Mr Cook
just, it just caught
my, my, you caught my
attention by
um the appren I, I'll
call it like an
apprenticeship.
So do you, do
you make them
uh
do a business plan?
Can you just kind of
roughly tell, give us
the curriculum of how that
works, please.
>> So the, it's a great
question uh member
Terrazas and
uh we, we've chosen
for this pilot
for industries.
Um And we
as the uh
the program maker, the game, the
gamemakers, we
are uh selecting
a cadre of about 100
ideas that could be
businesses in health
care and media and
entertainment and
aerospace. Uh And
again,
um industries that
are the state's
potential growth
industries.
We assign uh
ideas to
the entrepreneur and development
to vet. And that means
they'll get an idea on a Monday
and then use our playbook
to go out and do market
analysis, customer
discovery. Uh put
a lien canvas, which is kind
of a, a light business
model together and
come back by the end of that week
and say, look, I use
all these tools. I talked to
10 people and it
looks like this is a no go.
And here's why or
nine out of 10 said
if we could build this tomorrow,
they buy it right. On the
other hand. So there's
a playbook and then a
support team around
the entrepreneur and development
to kind of fill that gap
where they haven't had the experience
of launching a business
idea. Well, we're gonna
fill that gap um
to the point I think you're
coming from the
ideas could come from
their mind. But
actually, we want entrepreneurs and
development who just want to build
businesses and
they might have some ideas to put
into the funnel if you were,
if you will. But uh
we want only the
best ideas to come out. So
whether it's my idea, President
Hartzler idea, one of your
ideas, somebody in the community,
uh we're gonna trust the process
to, to bring forth
uh the, the, the
start-ups, who that are
the best timed that
the market wants right now,
et cetera. Um
And obviously the, the,
the funding we have isn't
sufficient to take
ideas from 100
to the one to that launch.
What we're going to do in the next six
months is take 100 ideas
and down select to 15 to
25 and
then uh look for further support
to continue the momentum
towards launching new
companies.
>> Well, thank you. Thank you very
much. Uh
Mr
Cook, I think what I
was looking at is, is
you wonder when
people graduate
from college or maybe they just have
an idea, they're risk
takers, right? But a
lot of times they, they may
not have the background in
knowing the land use
code
projections of what you know, they
need for personnel,
uh cash flow statements, et
cetera. And so I was, I was
curious about that. It's
funny because yesterday I told my
son,
um
I said, you know, I rented a piece
of equipment for
uh some work that we're doing on one of
our properties.
And um I, I
saw that guy, he started
with nothing
really, very little,
few piles of dirt and
a little tractor and
all of a sudden you walk in there, I went to
this yard and I go, golly,
this guy, he's grown
in leaps and bounds. And so
it's nice that you guys are doing that.
I know it's, it's hard to
narrow it down. And I just want,
I need to have a little understanding
of, of what the
process was and how you
narrow them down instead of just
having an idea because taking
an idea and seeing
it and making it viable
are two completely different
things. And so I think
you answered my question. Thank you,
Mr,
>> thank you, Representative. We'll go
to Representative
Lujan.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I appreciate
the time I just came
uh from Taos.
We're talking about our workforce
and behavioral health and um
healthcare workforce
there and
it was really bleak
outlook uh for
the workforce and the numbers
that we need for our
workforce in
that in those professions.
And so I just like
if, if I, I missed
something or if you can expand,
but, but we also got, you
know, we got a brief and information
on some of the, the legislation
that we passed this
even as lately as this
last session. And
SB 17
being one of them, uh a
full and big
discussion about that and
uh just where
those numbers
from, just the, the brief
amount of time that we've,
we've implemented that,
that, that law
and where we are with it and the
outlook from that law as
far as our,
our health care um
industry benefiting
from it. And those,
the, the hospitals
particularly who
is uh to benefit
those that need it the most are not
gonna get
the dollars that we thought they
were gonna get and just some of the
information.
But because we
are here at CNM, we are
up at U and M
in Taos.
Um So we're looking
at your leadership
and what you're what, how you're
moving the those uh those
jobs in the workforce
forward. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Mr, chair
members of the committee and Representative
Lujan. Uh And so
just very specific to
health care. Um And
I don't, I
appreciate that you live the bill
numbers more closely than I do.
So. SB 17 isn't,
I'm not sure what that
is,
but I would say if I'm looking for
funding, I think there's no question
that whether it's our legislators,
it's our leaders of hospitals,
it's our executive agencies.
Uh It's my board members.
We are all seeking,
I will say quick,
quick turnaround and quick
answers to be able to put
money, the money that
you have appropriated
to use quickly to develop
the workforce pipelines.
Um What I can tell you.
Well, thank you, the Health Care Delivery and Access
Act. I appreciate that
some of you sponsored it apparently. So,
thank you. Um
I will tell you that we
are the money you've put
in is allowing us
um
to, I will say change
how we are schedule.
We, you're allowing us to
change how we do business.
We know that a
continuous increase
and a slow increase of health
care professionals is not going to meet
our needs. We have to
change our education
delivery. We have to change our
scheduling, we have
to change how we are, how
and where we are offering
our programs,
certificate programs to get
people into health care, but also
then continuing support
and ongoing training to help
them um help
individuals grow in
their, their health care
profession. Um
So I will say the
work we are doing is not fast
enough to get the results that anybody
wants. It is
absolutely requiring
and demanding us to change how we
are working. So what I
can tell you is that when
we've had some influx of
funding, we have added
programs, we've
developed new programs to expand
the pipeline of individuals in
our workforce, we are partnering
differently with our health care providers,
whether it's, you know, and I'll just speak
very clearly to Central New
Mexico with health
uh UN M Health Sciences Center,
but also with Presbyterian and
Loveless on
um really upskilling
some of the individuals already in their
system, whether it's on their maintenance
crew, their customer support
teams and others who are
interested in exploring more in the
health care field. So we are designing
programs differently
to help. I'd say
upskill and broaden the
talent pool that they need
for allied health.
Um And so I
would say it's program development, it's
partnership, diff we're partnering
differently using our, our
public and our
private partnership um
resources to provide
programming in a different way and on
site. Um So what I can
tell you is that we don't have clear results
yet from some of the work that we
funded, we are
absolutely changing how we are doing
business. And I hope to
not just incremental
increases, but
dare I say, really um
more aspirational and significant
growth, not only in health care
but in some of the other areas that we're
we're exploring now here
with related to our venture
funds. >> That's wonderful.
Thank you and thank you for that update
on that part of it, but you are
really doing an incredible job here and I
hope to have some further
conversations and, and some of the
things you're you're doing in planning.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Representative Representative
Thompson. >> Thank
you, Mr Chair and thank you for
your presentation just to
follow up a little bit on what rep
Lujan, I chair the um
house Health and Human Services
Committee. So we are
beyond Codere
on workforce in New
Mexico from,
from direct care staff
all the way up to the most
qualified um
highly qualified
physician.
So,
and I know you probably
don't have these numbers if
you did. I would be shocked.
But I would, I would, I
think I, we, the whole
committee would like to
see what
healthcare professions you
have here.
How long each one
is,
um, current
students in the
program,
max students in the
program? I mean, what's your, what's
the max you can do
and waiting lists?
I think that would be really helpful
because we can't
tiptoe anymore. We need
to just break windows
and doors and figure
out how to catch
us up. So thank you so much for that.
Thank you madam
chair
>> and thank you Mr Chair.
Remember, I'll make sure to
um I don't have those numbers off the
top of my head. Certainly.
Um And I would be glad to make
sure the committee has that information
to provide to you. Thank
you. Thank
you, Representative Roybal
Caballero.
>> Thank you madam chair
and
this is going to follow
up with and thank you Representative
Thompson for the for
the specific
asks because that was
part of my question.
Health care is a general
category, very
general. So
my concern is that
we have certain
populations,
for example,
the geriatric
population is
aging
and we have been
told on a national
level as well
as regionally and
in our state that
the data the numbers
indicate based on census
numbers and census
information
that this
population will be one
of the largest populations
and therefore their
needs. Madam
chair are
going to be
greater. So
my specific
question is
how do we or
how do you plan
to zero
in on that data
and
look at, for
example, independent
contractors in
the helm health area,
home health delivery
area. Because
what the objective
is to keep
our aging population in
their homes
for as long as
possible and
reduce
the pressure
on facilities.
And so with that in
mind, we have
populations that are
language um
specific
and there's a deficiency
already, there's been a deficiency
for the past 10 years
in home health industry
that can deliver to
spanish-speaking
aging populations or
those that are homebound
and then also
are multiple
language
um languages
around the state.
So that
concerns me
because
we have had
um madam chair
um family
members that we've not
been able to receive
home health care because
of being language
deficient.
So
how in the data
or in the information that you
give back to us
if you could specifically
point to how
you will uh
increase the
workforce or
assist independent
contractors around the
state in order
to be able to
fulfill um
that or reduce
that deficiency. That's one
area, one question.
And then the other question has
to do with Mr
Cook's um
area two
questions I'm
interested in knowing
the, how
you plan to leverage
the 350,000.
Was it 50 or
60,000 that
you received
in being able
to
expand
or
go from the pilot
into an institutionally
driven program,
which is obviously a
great need.
And then um
where can we find
online or where
we can we get the information?
Perhaps you give it to us
um to
that
details. What
best idea
means? What does
best mean where,
what, what are you envisioning
as best?
Because sometimes
through the eyes
of you
and your committee
are different from where
our eyes are seeing
what best means.
And so it's, it's a
qualitative
um
description
versus a quantitative.
And so I'd be interested in
knowing what that
criteria is
that defines
best.
Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative Caballero.
Uh to the first point
about how we're leveraging the
it $315,000
to run this pilot.
Um One of the
big goals is
to alleviate any
barriers for an entrepreneur in
development to participate in the
program. So we are providing
stipends,
um living
stipends $3000 a
month. It's
not enough for them to see. Oh,
this is, you know, this is a great
job with great pay,
but it can, for
those who really want to be an entrepreneur
can alleviate a lot of
um blockers
they might otherwise face from
participating back to the
social capital and financial
capital.
Um the,
the rest of that is for the
team and the playbook and the suite
of tools that they'll be able
to use to quickly
validate or invalidate
ideas.
Um And that goes
to your second point.
I the website isn't up
yet for the program, but that would
be on the website. But we do have a
program description about
seven pages where we'd be
happy to send to all
representatives of this committee
uh describing the,
the program and
really what's called the stage
gate process
of uh
getting the 100 ideas
down to
60 down to
30. Um
And to your point about
great ideas
and you know, great
ideas in my mind being
different from uh
your mind and, and
people's mind
really, the source of truth
is whether there's customers who want
to buy or not.
And uh so the
whole playbook and the
mindset of our E I Ds
and the program team
is to say
we thought idea number
one was great, but actually the
market wants idea number
nine. So that's the one we're going to
run with and
really to alleviate a lot
of. Um and
this is the venture studio model
now that that is exciting
because it alleviates
a lot of the psychological
and cognitive bias we
feel when we love an
idea. Um And
it brings data at
critical milestones
to say by
the data. This one deserves to
proceed and get more funding
and time and attention.
This one. I know you love it.
TJ. But there's no
data supporting that anybody
wants it. So we're going to table that
for now. >> Thank you
Mr Chair. And that's precisely
why it began with the
issue or the description
of the data driven
and how we respond to
data driven
information because that's
critically important.
And so we reduce
the general category of
health care down
to what the data
tells us is
important need to
fulfill. Thank you, Mister chair.
Thank you very much for your
answers. >> Thank
you, Representative Representative De La
Cruz.
Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
I'm always impressed withs
just amazing, amazing
organization. But when we talk
about entrepreneurship,
one of the impediments
is to that.
And I don't know that it, it it Mr
Chairman, it really correlates
with your work but
very often trying to get
off the ground for, for
a budding business is
is local government. Uh
Burnley County
city of Albuquerque can make it
so difficult Mr Chairman
to, to do business sometimes
just to literally
build a facility
or remodel a facility.
Uh Has there been any
discussion around
maybe somehow working
with local government to bring
him into the fold of sorts
so that it makes it a little
more uh
realistic to try
to do business.
>> Uh Mr Chair members of the
Committee Representative de La
Cruz, uh
CNM
me as president, I sit on
the board of the Albuquerque
Economic Develop uh economic
Albuquerque regional
economic
Alliance
area. Um and
also engage very
closely with city officials
and county officials, not only Burle
but certainly Sandoval County and
others um
to work on
removing barriers for
development and what and to
align zoning also
frankly, to provide workforce to
help in, I
would say the governments um
be able to do their work
site inspection, fire
inspection. I mean, so really there's even
a workforce component to this,
but there's no question that we
engage um
with our government leaders,
regular local government
leaders regularly
to identify ways
to remove barriers. And I'm
pleased to say that this
is a priority for everyone,
not just not only our small
businesses, but honestly, even as
a, as a large business as CNM
is, we certainly seek those
ways to be sim to do our
work simpler, to be able to put our
facilities in use
um to change use
when needed. So there's no question that
we're all working on those together.
Again, we all want faster
progress on what we're doing. I'm
pleased though that we're all that
many of us are working together
in concert to move
the needle. So I appreciate
thank you for raising the challenges
and helping us identify ways we can
work together. >> Mr
Chairman. Uh
maybe there's room for
some type of
coursework that would,
would assist
employees that
might eventually
find themselves in a position
in government that
interacts and interfaces with
the public when it comes
to business development. I say
that because uh
often government employees
and having been a,
I'm a recovering
bureaucrat,
uh
they see themselves not
so much as partners with the
community or
partners with a new business,
but sometimes as
gatekeepers
versus partners.
And there might
be some room for some
education in that
arena. Uh Just
simple things, things
that, well, let me give you an example.
I was adjunct facility here at
CNM. One of the classes
that I taught was
business interpersonal
skills and that was
really how to maneuver
in the workplace to
try to get to
be effective and, and, and
help your own career.
I I almost envisioned
something potentially like
that that would
allow for
the growth in that field in
government. Although they
themselves are not entrepreneurs,
they understand
that symbiotic relationship that
is often lacking.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. That's more of a
comment.
>> Thank you very much. Representative,
I should have taken your course when you
were when you had that
here.
So I >> think chairman, you were
young enough to do that. >> I was,
I was actually, I was about seven
at that point. I'm kidding.
So we'll go to vice Chair
Garrett if you had a couple of
comments and questions.
>> Thank you and, and
thank you, Mr chair and
Representative de La Cruz.
I think we need to make a mini
summit in Buro
County with
bringing these people together and
address it because I'd love to
see since we have the N
MA A building
on specs for small business
development. That's,
yeah, so we'll pursue
that. Um
President Hartzler, my first
question is to
you, the dual credit program has
been very successful
and you have the early,
early college program on
campus noc is on
campus. Do
you have an estimate of
how many high school
graduates have
graduated with an
associate's
degree
over the last year from
this
institution?
>> Thank you, Representative Garrett
for the question and
members of the committee chair,
Mr Chair. Um
I'll absolutely get that
information to
you. I can tell you of
the um college and career
high school that CNM has on
campus. Uh We
had more than 52
we had more than 50
individuals who earned their
associates, many
more, earned an
additional associate's degrees,
many more earned uh credentials
or certificates uh
by taking the dual
credit courses at C
but I'll be, and that's, I would
say that's only the high school.
We certainly partner with over
100 near 100 and 20
different high schools
in our service area in
Buro County, but also in Sandoval
where we have
more than 3000 students
taking high school students taking dual
credit classes, whether in their high
schools or here on any of
our campuses. And
so I don't have the information
on how many of those students have
earned their
certificates
credentials, maybe in their
industry or
um to show certain
competencies, whether it's in health
care or it or
cyber media
production um or
their degrees. But I'll be glad to send that,
give that information to you.
>> Thank you and, and Mr
Chair. Yeah, the whole
picture and not by
tomorrow, but it would be
really helpful for us to
know. Um
My second comment is I
am thrilled with the
energy that
CNM is
spearheading, not
just here but around the state
with small business
development and with
all the entre
entrepreneurial,
I actually learned how to spell that
word. Um
TJ that you're working
with in uh
ingenuity.
Um
My question is
often they'll project
that our school age
population is going down.
Our population is
going down. I actually
disagree. I was at physical
therapy today with a physical
therapist that moved here from
Texas and
I know three people, three
friends of my son who have moved
from out of state and are
taking courses or have taken
courses at CNM.
Do you have any
data as
to people
moving from out of state
into this area?
Enrolling at CNM?
Because to me, all
the entrepreneurial work,
all the focus on
the burgeoning
New Mexico
industries
is good news for
growing our population.
We are one of the fastest growing
states for retired
people. But
how we can get
our kids in the
twenties, thirties, you know, as you
get older kids become
older twenties, thirties
and forties how
we can attract them. Do we have
any data
on CN M's
interaction with people who
are moving into the
state? Do you collect
that? >> Um Great
question. I don't, I
don't believe we collect it in the way that you're
asking. And so, I mean,
we like any
institution, we have a lot of
data. We don't always
have it in the way we want it
or, or, or segmented
the way we would like to be
responsive to answer the question.
So I'll be able to see what we
have because as you know,
once people do move here, uh
they become residents so
simple mechanisms of
do we charge them out of state tuition or
in-state tuition or certain
training programs? Um It
masks some of that. Did
they come from somewhere else? So
I'd have to do some digging to see how we
do that. But um
again, I'll just note that
um a third of our students
at CNM or ingenuity
already have a degree. So
again, people who are coming into the state
will come here and seek additional
certifications or
um licenses
perhaps. Um And so there's
some other ways we can find that information
and it wouldn't surprise me that we have many
individuals who are, when they're seeking another
skill set or upskilling
that they come from somewhere else.
They have a credential or degree from
somewhere else and we're, we're helping
them become more relevant in
this market. Um and particularly
because the legislature has made such an
incredible,
and the governor's made such an incredible
investment in training
funds, whether it's the legislative lottery
scholarship, the opportunity scholarship
or through weel a funds and, and
the training funds that we have. So, I
mean, I,
um it's
a good question, I'll see how we can possibly
get some of that data and, and,
and there's no question, it's important
data to, to
know.
>> Thank you. Um And Mr
Chair, my final comment is
so Nick Miane used to
be the head of New Mexico
Film. Now he's head
of Netflix Studios
which uh Senator is in
Senator Padilla's area.
He was there at the ribbon cutting.
My there's
gaps. So I've been working
with two people who are, you know,
trying to sell their scripts
to Netflix or streaming
service. However,
Nick, when I asked him at the
Albuquerque, one of those
Albuquerque economic
luncheons, he said,
oh, you have to go to L
A. The
agents the lawyers are in L
A. It seems like we're
building all
of the
mechanisms to
film. But
those kind of job, we
have some producers and
people who are moving
here, but we also
need that niche
of
professionals.
My new word is C
suite people
agents
that
work here so
that people
working in this business
don't have to deal with people
in L A,
but we have that
specialized workforce here. So
that's just a comment
of we have some gaps
that I think
would uh
help our
film and television
and entertainment industry
>> if I may just quickly
response because I know you, you want to stay
on schedule. Um I'm
really excited
that, you know, we're building
on C and M's 20 year
plus history of film.
We certainly provide a
lot of a workforce for Netflix
and Elise, um
NBC Universal and we
can do it on the list. Right. And that's why
we're um and that's why you
have invested in the rail
yards and some other areas in Las
Cruces around developing
film and the New
Mexico Arts collaborative.
I believe that's what the state's
effort at the rail yards is
called. What's been
interesting. Also to see though
is exactly what you
Representative Bureau are pointing out is the
development along double
Eagle Airport. So when
we look at what is next for
film, which again will
serve um Netflix
but will also serve
our community. Um
a broader community.
It's really bringing in that next
level. Um and a more
soph knowledgeable,
experienced level, not
only C suite but certainly more
experienced level of
um talent to the community.
And I'm really excited that we've had a
number of CNM and
has had a number of conversations
on building out that
um uh
segment of
the film and media population
around. Uh and it, and
it's the talent that's coming here because
they want to live in New Mexico. They want
to experience this quality of life that
we enjoy. Um
And so I look forward to
seeing more how that
development at Double Eagle will
shape our work because it
really will not only challenge CNM
and ingenuity, it'll challenge the University
of New Mexico and all of us in the
area to really
um be very responsible to
attract talent, but to certainly
grow our own because that's really where
as you noted we want to be.
So I appreciate you raising the topic.
It's very exciting. Thank
you and Double Eagle is in my
district. Thank
you.
>> Ok, thank you very much,
madam Vice Chair. Um
Well, first, let me just,
I have a couple of comments I want
to make first before
you leave. Can you please fire
up all of the taps over
there? And then
um you had
assumed you were going to give me a key
to that room over there
and uh
>> I'm sure there's an anti donation
element somewhere in it. But,
>> but by
the time, you know, one o'clock
rolls around, you might want to come back because
people are going to be passed out of sleep.
So anyway, but thank you very
much. A lot of my questions
were answered. II, I think I have a
question primarily for
TJ. Um
Just and by the way, madam president,
outstanding five years of
just fantastic work. So,
thank you very much. I
know it's hard and you
had to live through, get moving
into this role when a very challenging
time was happening for this entire
world. And just, you've done a
remarkable job. I'm very proud of you
and your team. Keep up the good
work. But on the
entrepreneurial stuff, are, are
you at all making
these classes
available or these
certifications
available to existing business
as well? Because, you know,
I've been in business for 24 years
and I'm sure I could use a really
great tune-up, you know, on
things, anything like
that going on.
>> It's actually a great
question, Mr
Chair.
Yes. In, in so far
as this playbook we're developing
to serve these
four E I Ds through
the pilot is
useful. It's a useful instrument
for any entrepreneur. We
are going to be incorporating that
into our broader activate New
Mexico program
and, and Kudos to Jeff
Bardell, who's here
and uh the program
manager for that Lindsay Humphries,
really incredible team
there. Um So we
see this playbook as not only
useful to empower our
entrepreneurs and development,
but as you said,
hey, especially
when you have some battle scars, you know, like
there's got to be a better, better
way to do this.
Um We can integrate
that playbook to the broader
services we're offering, you
know, hundreds of entrepreneurs
a year through, activate New Mexico.
Certainly.
>> Well, thank you.
Um You know, I really appreciate
that because what I would
ask is,
and I'm not sure how you do this, but here's
some, a challenge for you to consider
is, you know, so a lot has
happened in my industry in
24 years, it
used to be, the hard part
was to get the
technology
implemented and active
and all that stuff and it was the
hard part was finding the right people
and training them the right way and
all this and that it's the complete
opposite. Now, I can turn up
a call center or one of my, my
business clients there operates,
I can turn it up and a day
if I need to maybe a couple of hours
if I needed to. The hard part
now is finding, you know, the,
the right people and all that stuff.
So if, if
you can please look at it from the lens
of taking a business
from sort of that uh beginning
of the hockey curve, the
hockey stick. Right, right in this
very sweet spot right here to really
catapulting them. I think
that's what's really would be really
helpful in some cases. So,
just a suggestion there
and then the last thing and I'll
ask madam president, uh what do you
need from us? What do you need from us to
continue? You kind
of talked a little bit about it, but what do you need from
us to really help you continue
on the trajectory with which you've
taken this world-class
institution?
>> Mr Chair and members of the committee? Well,
again, I'll start with, I'm really
excited about your agenda.
What you're hitting on is
what um we are trying
to do through CNM
ingenuity, which is to
support New Mexico
businesses, to fund
New Mexico businesses
to find reputable
entities to I'll
say take a, take a, a calculated
risk on growing
business and training leaders
um so that we can not
only grow business but that
I as a college, which we can
provide the qualified workforce
for that business as well. So
again, I think what you're doing
and how you work with
um and how you, your
oversight for NM FA is really
important. Make sure money
gets out the door. I will tell
you and, and I won't use any
NM programs. But when I look
at money again, as Representative
Lujan said, we, you know, you've
appropriated so much. How are you
making progress? We have such
dire needs.
This legislature has supported
$60 million in workforce
training. That's
about $20 million a year for
three years. CNM
might get about $4
million. We are ready to spend this money.
I cannot
after regular communication,
it's very hard to get the rules
out of the department to say
here's the money, here's
how you can spend it and get
going. Because I know you asked a quick
questions of and what
have you done?
Really important questions and
we really want to meet the need.
So I, I would say it's very
um we are challenged but we are
excited by the challenge. So thank you for
making resources available
and making sure that the money's
I'll, I'll say staying in New
Mexico, but really growing our talent in our
businesses in a way
that um and you're going to make
sure NM FA and others support
entities that have
a little bit of a track record and are
certainly committed to our
region and our community. So, thank
you for doing that. So again, thank
you for your, your agenda. It's a really
powerful agenda I think.
>> Well, thank you, madam president.
Thank you um
Mister executive director. Thanks for
answering my questions and all the questions
to the committee here. And just
again, don't forget to fire up the taps
before you leave and then also
just leave a key in the corner of your
desk over there. We'll get it back to
you at some point this week,
at some point this week you'll find
the key under your door, ok?
And then one of us laying on the ground in the
parking lot. But anyway,
it's been a tough
12 years madam
president.
So going into my 13
feels like 20. But I thank
you before you take off. I do want to ask
two members just to introduce themselves
to you because we did come to your house
today. Uh Repres
Senator Gallegos
and then Representative Serato,
please,
>> Mr Chair and audience.
Thank you. I'm State Senator
David Gallegos. I'm from District
41 Eddie and Lee County.
I had to step out for a phone
call. I appreciate the
opportunity to be here. This is actually
my first time in CNM.
I believe a beautiful
facility. I finally
saw the name of the building as
I walked into the
courtyard. Uh
but beautiful facility. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you, madam,
President TJ. Good to see you again.
Uh I'm Representative Linda Serrano. I
represent the south side of Santa Fe.
Thanks.
>> Thank you, Senator and representative. And
just one last thing, if you'll just
indulge me, I'm going to try to get
his attention. He's in the back of the
room there. I wanted to
thank Harold
Lavender, who's with us today? Does
a as you start eating
something Harold.
But so, so to
the committee who, who may not know
who this towering.
And I'm actually being dead serious when I
say this towering example of
leadership here in our state. Just
to a good guy all
around served on our State
Investment Council for, for a very,
very long time, probably one of the longest serving
members that's permissible under
the constitution. I'm not quite sure. Maybe
there was a couple more years in there, who
knows? But I want to thank you, Harold
for all the work that you've done over the years for
the State of New Mexico massive
projects that you've helped get done
in our state, including a lot of the work done
around here and you continue.
You could just be off sitting
with a pina colada somewhere
on a beach. But you choose to continue
to work for all of us. And I just
want to say thank you. Can we give Harold a hand
everybody? Thank
you.
Three words, Harold. Just three
words. That's,
I'm
>> kidding.
Um, just haven't been
able to get through. >> Well,
we are grateful for you and all the
time. You've, you've been here in New Mexico.
You've contributed every day. Thank
you very much. Thank you, madam, president.
All right, committee. So we're just going to
keep on rolling here. We don't have anybody else
walk in. We're going to go
to item number two. I'll invite
the Investment and Bioscience
Industries Group to come on
up. That is Stephanie.
I'm just going to say Stephanie, you'll
have to educate us on, on how
to pronounce the last name. Executive
Director of New Mexico Bioscience
Authority. Paul Lauer,
chair Board of Directors in New
Mexico Science
Authority Chief operating Officer
Mercury Bio. There's a
couple of, that's a big business card
right there. Dale Decker
also a pretty remarkable
New Mexican. I see him there.
Thank you, Dale for being here member,
Board of Directors, New Mexico
Bioscience Authority, Founder Decker
Persin Architects, engineers
and planners and
Alex Coogan phd,
board member of New Mexico Bioscience
Authority, co-founder
Nature's Toolbox Incorporated.
And I will tell you that
we are slight. We
were ahead of schedule. So we were
behind schedule. We caught up. Now, we're a little
bit behind again, but we'll give you
all the time you need and we'll hand it over
to Stephanie if you want to do
some further introductions and get rolling.
Thank
you.
>> Ok. Thank you so much.
Uh Mr Chair, uh
as you've introduced
us, um, we are the new
Mexico Bioscience Authority
and we are going to be talking about
the things that we've identified
as the bioscience
industry needs to be able
to grow. Um We
were created back in 2017
in order to be able to do that.
Um We've been working really hard
to be able to identify
um some strategies and
we look forward to presenting
them to you today.
Um So we'll start
with an introduction from
our um longest
number
and recently
um yes
and recently uh step
down chair. So, um chair
Paul Lore has now taken
that place and then Alex
Doctor Alex Coghlan is
our newest
member.
>> OK, great. So, uh my
name is Dale Decker and I get to lead it
off. Probably the best
part of
being the bioscience uh
chair is
voting for a new
chair at the last meeting. So I'm
past here, but I get
the honor of teaming
this up today. And
again, this is a
real time
powerpoint presentation.
So if you can just follow along with
me, I'd appreciate it.
So, uh the Bioscience
Authority, as Stephanie mentioned was
created in uh by
Senate Bill 478
in 2017. And it's
really one of the few
public private partnership
pieces of legislation
that's ever been created,
which really encouraged and I
think had the foresight
around the value of public
private partnerships to help
grow and diversify our state's
economy. Uh You
can see the mission there.
I think we've been very effective
at a, at
uh uh
helping the mission of the
Bioscience Authority be
successful on a very
limited budget
and going forward. I think
there's great opportunity just
to lay additional
groundwork for how we can grow
the Biosciences
in our state.
Uh Next slide
is the organization
of the Bioscience Authority.
And again, we're a 13
person board
appointed by
legislature,
the governor and
are represented by
uh uh
appointees from
State Tech
and UN M Health
Sciences and
per the enacting legislation
that created Bioscience
Authority. We
are administratively
attached to
and shall be considered an
affiliated organization
of the UN M Health
Science Center, which
is really good because it, it,
it means that a lot of the
overhead functions
that typically an authority
like this might have to have,
we really access it
on an as needed basis.
So hr
legal and other
services are provided by the
university. So we don't have to
duplicate a whole bunch of
staff kind
of moving forward and we're
very lean and mean,
you can see who is on
the board. Uh We
do have a few openings.
And fortunately,
Alex is here today
as our newest board
member, a very
accomplished
bioscience
uh entrepreneur.
And I think he's going to
talk about the importance
of, of what the
bioscience Authority and what
Biosciences mean to our, our
state.
This is our staff.
Uh Stephanie has been
probably, I've been on any
number of
committees and
boards. She
is probably the best
executive director
I've ever been involved with
organized
thorough.
And I, I mean, and you
all know what that value that
brings, especially to
volunteers who are serving on
boards. And I'm sure
Sabina is the same way.
And it's, it's really
this individuals
like Stephanie and Sabina that
help our state
run efficiently in these
organizations. Ran
Cangelosi who many
of, you know, is our strategy and
policy director. He's part
time. Uh Anne
Laurie Schmidt,
All
Olivier
Olivier. Not, not
Olive. Ok. She's
our intellectual property
specialist. The more we
get into vetting companies
that are in the Biosciences, she has a
vital role. And
of course, Sterley Nichols,
who's our program specialist
who works right
hand. He's back
there someplace. Hey,
Sterling.
Oh, he's taking pictures. Oh, good.
Well, hey, he's the,
he's the master of
all trades there. So we
appreciate that.
So our goal really is to
build a stronger bioscience
industry, uh, through
public private
partnerships.
We have great relationships.
And again, what's cool about this
board is it is statewide
and it is comprised
primarily of people
who really understand the
Biosciences. Uh
The exception being
me, a
architect. What
am I doing here? I'm doing
here because I believe that
Biosciences is one of those
economic development
clusters that can
greatly help
diversify our
economy and
it's uh the life sciences
is something that we should
be involved in. So
the next big red question mark
is why Biosciences
in New Mexico.
And really, we've got
a tremendous
assets in our
state that a
lot of states would have to
recreate. We have
uh obviously our three R
and D uh research
universities, we have
our national labs.
I mean, combined, that's probably
what, 10 $12
billion of R
and D activity probably
more than that in
our state Biosciences
is one of those things.
Uh The reason I'm
interested in this, it
does create very high
paying green
jobs or sustainable
jobs. Uh They'll
last a long time in our state,
they'll continue to grow.
And I think that's something that's
very important as we look forward
to diversifying our
economy is
what are those growth industries
that's going to take our state
into the future?
And then the, the, the
Biosciences, some
people might just think it's
pharmaceuticals and drugs,
but it covers a wide
spectrum of
industries being from
agriculture, uh
feedstock and
chemicals, really
water tech as well.
Uh Bioscience
related distribution and
packaging, drugs,
pharmaceuticals,
medical devices and
equipment. We have some
of the best
uh
orthopedic
medical scientists
with U and M that are
inventing uh great
orthopedic devices,
uh research,
bioinformatics testing
and medical laboratories which
Paul and
Alex will touch on in a
minute. So these are
all greatly uh
growing industries. And
plus there's kind of cross
fertilization between
this and our other
states. Uh economic
development, clusters of
sustainable and value-added
agriculture as
well as renewable and green
energy. And you
can see this chart here.
Uh This is a probably a
little bit old. I think
we're, we're seeing that
this industry year
over year is just
growing, growing, growing.
And during COVID-19,
there was a whole new science
uh created to deal
with that. There was a whole
new ways
of, of
testing and
verifying drug
viability uh
because there was such a global
demand for it. So
with that, I'm gonna turn it over to
Stephanie. Uh who's
gonna kind of go through our industry
cluster? Thank
you. >> So, another
really valuable
reason to be looking at
the Biosciences specifically right
now is that
since the New
Mexico Bioscience Authority was
created after the grow
bio report was done in
2016, which was a public
private partnership.
Um looking at, you know,
what industries would be
viable to help diversify
the economy. Uh We've
had an opportunity to look back
at that report to see what
has been happening to the bioscience
companies that were identified
in that report. Um
this summer. Uh We're lucky
to have a couple of interns that
are helping us with
um operations
with uh working through some
of the, the programming that
we're working on developing.
And one of them is doing a report
on that on
the, the grow bioport.
And so he's looking at the,
the companies that were
identified as being,
you know, the reason to follow
the bioscience industry
development.
And we've seen some
startling
developments as a, as
a result of that. And we haven't
been able to look at the companies that have
grown since that time.
But since that time, a
third of the companies
that he's looked at so far,
which are in Bernalillo,
Curry, Chavez,
um Sibila and Colfax
County have left the
state or have,
have dissolved. And
so that's, that's saying
a lot like of those companies,
900 jobs have been
lost in Bernalillo County
as a result of those,
those companies, you know,
dissolving or moving.
And so we see that there is a really
big reason to
focus in on the that
development and especially
right now when the
state is financially doing,
you know, quite well,
we need to use that funding to
be able to support, you know,
the development of these
companies. And so what
we've been able to see
through, um
you know, the research that we've been
doing is that in order
to help bioscience companies
succeed in New Mexico,
they need financial capital,
they need lab space,
they need an educated workforce
and they need experienced executive
leadership.
So we're going to talk a little
bit about the
recommendations that we
make to help
meet those
needs.
Yeah,
>> Mr Chair and committee members,
a pleasure to be here today
and to
meet with you all and try
and describe a little bit about
what we do in the
uh bioscience
industry.
Um My name is Paul
Lore. I'm the
founder and
uh coo of Mercury
Bio, which is a Santa
Fe based start up
that has developed a drug
delivery platform that's
basically uh
disease
agnostic
and uh can be
utilized for everything from
treating viral infections
to cancer, therapies,
to genetic
disorders. And
uh we've been at it for about four
years now and
um going strong,
we've grown the
company, we've
uh been able to raise
about $4 million in that
period. Uh We've
also now applied
for a $19
million DARPA
grant or
sorry, um
contract
to basically utilize our
platform to
protect soldiers
going into the battlefield that
might be uh attacked
by bio
threats or chemical
threats. So the
government sees a
need for this.
That's why they put out the
announcement and our
delivery platform superior
to what's out there.
Um But to
get to the point of this uh
presentation,
uh we
need financing uh
bio
biotech companies
uh typically are and,
and especially what
uh what we're working on and
what Alex has done
is um they,
they take time, it's, it's
really raw, cutting
edge research, which is
very expensive. Uh
We have in our
company, 10
scientists working at the
lab and we just hired
five new people this
year. Average
salaries 93,000
a year.
Um And
uh what
we're developing
uh is
takes a while before we can
actually market it to
get to a point where we can
uh sell it to make revenue.
So uh
a industry term is called
Biobox. We raise money
based on our intellectual
property and what we can
um convince people
that uh we
have uh
that will be valuable
one day and when it
is, it'll be incredibly
valuable. I mean, I can say,
I can say with
a straight face, I think this company
could be a billion dollar company,
but it's gonna take another
couple of years to really realize
that kind of valuation.
Um And so we, we
are using II I
do like to leverage
federal funds. As I
mentioned, we just uh
put in a proposal for
a DARPA grant uh contract.
Um My chairman
of my board just sent me an, an
email this morning about
a program that Barta
which is the biological
area of the defense
department put
out. And um
they're basically spending
uh
$4.7
billion to come up with
a cure for COVID,
which includes everything from
vaccines to
diagnostics
there. Uh The
director of that program
is uh Gary
Dis. Uh
Basically, he said they're
not looking at the size of the
company to invest in,
they're looking at the company's
technology.
Um
So they've
invested for instance,
34 million in
a company called Castle
Back and 40 million in another
one called Cyan back.
Um So we're right in that
sweet spot.
Um
But the reason
I'm on the Bioscience
Authority Board uh
is because I
believe that there's a gap
in New Mexico for
funding start up
companies. Um
I know we have economic
development programs that work
well and companies are fairly
well established. Uh
But to get out of
that valley of death, to get
the initial funding, you
need to get to that
point. Um
It's really, you have to go
around and get it from friends
and family.
So the Bioscience
Authority was
developed uh created
in order I I believe, to
fill that gap. And
as many of, you
know, I went through the legislative
session two years
ago as an expert
witness and we
had a unanimous
approval for a
$25 million
Coves Fund.
Um That would be matched 2
to 1 with private equity.
Um It would be
uh basically
overseen by uh
finance and
by uh economic
development. Uh We
would partner with venture
capital groups that would do
the uh the
vetting the due diligence
on the company and bring those deals
to the table. Um
And I think this is incredibly
important for New Mexico
uh because it needs to
diverse its economy away
from oil and gas,
which is boom or bust
tourism, which is
great, but it's not um
it's not the same
as what we're talking
about here.
Um These
are uh people.
Uh I worked at a company called
Pebble Labs. We
brought in 80 people,
scientists that moved here
from out of state.
And uh
when Pebble
Labs declined during
uh COVID, many of
those people found jobs
with uh NTX
Bio. Many of them are
working at Mercury Bio now.
Many are working at
Pacifica in Santa
Fe. Um
That's what we're trying to achieve
here with this Coves
Fund is an economic
ecosystem so that people
can uh they
move here, they buy a house,
they relocate their
families. Uh
If, if that biotech
company doesn't
succeed, they can get
a, they can still stay here
and get a job down
the street with another biotech
company.
Um
And as I mentioned, it's a 2 to
1 match.
Um It's
uh
uh we, the
Bioscience Authority
has uh
experts t
as myself and Alex,
especially having
grown biotech companies in
New Mexico. So we know what it
takes and we can
actually see what
uh um what
companies are worth
investing in and
what, what companies may not
be a great
investment. Uh
Also, we, we want
to uh we,
we had to address a
few concerns of
the governor. So we put in some
more uh
cons uh conditions
of taking the funds,
basically that they have to
stay in New Mexico
and create jobs here for a
period of five years.
Um We would
actually like to make that
investment request
of $50 million
which was what was recommended
by an independent
third party that said this
is what it would take for New
Mexico to
uh really create a uh to,
to, to
move the needle on
the industry. Um
And, and I'll mention that
other states are doing this
very aggressively.
You know, the big biotech areas
are Boston, San Francisco,
San Diego and
uh North Carolina.
But states like
Colorado, Arizona,
uh Cal California
puts in over a billion dollars a
year into biotech.
So that's, that's what we're competing
against. And
uh also I'll mention
that uh one
of the areas Stephanie
pointed out was
uh I'm sure we can get to
that later. But
um Sea
Sea Level Management,
in my experience, we
have a great seat,
uh a great
board and a great
management team at Mercury
Bio. And these are folks that have done
this elsewhere but
have moved to New Mexico
because of the quality of life
and they don't want to move again.
So we, we do have talent
here. It's a matter of giving
them the resources that they need
to, to be able to live
here.
Um And why
should the Bioscience
uh authority lead
the Coves Fund?
Um Again, I'm
kind of repeating myself
but the
um we
have experience in this
area. Uh
There are other funds
that are uh focused
on other areas,
but we are specifically
uh interested in the
bioscience
industry. Um
And, and, and there's,
it's a very broad-based thing,
as we have mentioned as Stephanie
mentioned, um
one of the areas where
biotech is
very, has a great
potential is
in uh reducing
climate change
of driving the uh
atmospheric carbon
dioxide levels down
through uh algae
cultivation. Uh
For example,
>> uh Mr Laer be while you
transition to the next page,
uh just need to do a bit of committee
business because we've established a quorum.
So I apologize for interrupting your
presentation. Uh So
I called us to order earlier members
of the committee and a in a subcomittee
and I'll now call the committee to order
with a quorum. And I do
need to ask the committee very quick to
apologize for this but a
lot going on, you know, we're citizen
legislatures. So we're all running in circles.
Can I ask the draw the committee's
attention to the, in your
folder, the November
1, 1st through 2nd
2023
minutes. And I will
entertain a motion to adopt.
So move by Representative
Rabal Cavia. Do I have a 2nd
2nd by
Representative Serato?
All those in favor? Say I,
all those opposed.
All right, the minutes are
adopted. I'll now draw your
attention to
the other set of committee minutes.
Our last meeting, May 9th,
2024.
I have a motion by
representative. No, no, I have a
representative by Representative Chatfield.
You have a comment.
We'll come back to that. Um,
do I have a
second
senator? Uh, Pinto
move has made a second
Representative
Chapfield,
>> uh, the water project
out of the water project
going
that?
>> Ok.
And we will make that correction uh,
to our committee director. Do you have
that
one more time. Representative
Chatfield,
the turn on
your mic.
Let's turn on your mic for
that
Mr chair members of the
committee. That is correct. I
will make that. That
is anything else.
Representative Chatfield?
Ok. So we have a motion
by Representative Rabel Cerro and we
have a second by Senator Pinto.
All those in favor. Say
a and you
say no. All
right. Those minutes are
adopted. Pretend
like that never even
happened.
You got to take a drink of water and
everything. Look at you. All right, let's go ahead
and continue. Thank you. Thank you,
committee >> uh
Mr chairman and committee
members. That was actually
a good uh breaking
point because I'd like to
uh I've, I've spoken
enough about what we've done
at Mercury Bio and other companies
that I've been involved with over the
years in this industry.
But I'd like to turn it over to
doctor Coghlan,
uh who is founder
of NTX Bio to
give us his
uh uh vision of
our and insights
into what uh what it takes
to be a successful
biotech company,
which he is very
much uh done.
That.
>> That's a high
um Mr chair, committee
members. Uh Good morning. Um
Thank you very much for your time
uh for the opportunity to present
what the bioscience Authority
does for the state and
tries to propose
to expand.
Let's roll in the state. My name is
Alex Coopland. I'm
co-founder of NTX
Nature's Toolbox, a
company that
I started
after living in Los Alamos
at the end of 2015,
with the goal to
develop manufacturing
technologies for
pharmaceuticals. This is small
enough that it actually can
scale up and down quickly.
It is not dependent
on which
is still today, several
tens of thousands of square
feet production
spaces
but can be distributed
to actually create a level
of redundancy
and a fast response
as we all learned that where
the two things that we actually
missing
in 2020 20 to
21.
So we
started out
with funds
from New
Mexico Angels
and at the Santa Fe
Community College in the
mezzanines there and converted
them into lab space simply because
there was no efficient lab
space available anywhere
for us to actually get
going.
Um We stayed
there through the
beginning of the pandemic
and actually, until the
fire marshal of Santa Fe told
us that he has an increasing
issue with having desks
in hallways and staircases
simply because we were running out
of space
and with the help
of the state
here, in
particular of the Secretary
of
Economic Development at the time,
Alicia Keys and to
Deputy at the time,
Mark Roper and the
city of Rio Rancho, we
actually could secure a building
in Rio Rancho
and with the help of
dps turned us
into a 25,000 square
feet lab facility
and simply
had at the time,
the support of the
investors and of the
state and of the city
that we were able to do this, that
everybody accepted
that there is
in time
that needs to be spent
until the
facility is ready. We can move
in and can use it.
The issues that
most start-ups certainly
do not have this flexibility, do
not have this luxury.
There were two things that really
played in our favor. That
sounds horrible on the
surface. But at the end, it helped
to rethink also at
regulatory agencies
was the pandemic
and the desperate need to actually
allow us to get going and
continue our work
with the support
of federal
agencies as
well.
Um Rebuilt
in Rio Rancho, the
company to
basically an employment base of
50 people
with a median income
of now 100 and
$8000
and basically raised
non IUT dilutive
and through partnerships
close to $100 million
for the company.
So this actually
certainly was
possible because the support
was there, the support by the
state, by the city
and that was acknowledged
by the investors that we
had by the vcs,
by the venture capitalists
that invested in us
and also by federal agencies
that had an interest for us to
grow.
At the end, what we said
is,
and what we learned in this
process is that the need for
lab space for qualified
lab, space for
connecting companies,
start-ups in the state
is absolutely crucial.
So this is
necessary,
you cannot expect somebody
to settle and find a
home when there's no land
to build on. And there
is no structure there that actually
allows to start
somewhere.
And, and
this
is part of what we try to
accomplish to actually
create a network. And
that allows start-ups
to connect,
to communicate,
to identify space,
to identify
workforce and
allow in connection of both.
So to really
create a crystallization
core for an
industry that
could be incredibly strong in the
state, simply because
Paul pointed it out,
Stephanie as well,
that there are few things that
are absolutely unique in the state.
There's
um to
national labs with a
strong focus on Biosciences
and sustainability
in all
industrial areas.
There's a number of higher education
centers that actually
identified Biosciences
and everything associated
with Biosciences and
sustainability as one of their
core
responsibilities.
And quite honestly also the
need to, with
everything this is happening with a
New Mexico
needs to be
sustainable, needs to
be seen under the eyes of
sustainability to preserve
energy, water
and the resources that are there.
So with
that set up,
I strongly
believe that New Mexico
can be absolutely
unique and can be leading
in the field.
But it needs the
support
to be able to do that
to actually really give the
kickstart to provide the
crystallization core
to really um
trigger this much more
substantially than
what basically private
industry and universities
in its own tried to do in the
past. Thank
you
>> uh Mr Chair Committee
Vandenberg.
Um
Lab space is absolutely
critical. Uh
biotech
equipment's incredibly
expensive. Um
You know, we're talking about being
able to
modify organisms
to, you know, genetically
engineer
uh uh
on a
very
complicated
science. Uh It
requires
uh bioinformatics
for computational
predictions.
Uh It requires
um devices
that can measure parts
per trillion of
certain molecules
that can quantify
and qualify,
uh, what's going on
on a, on a cellular
level. Um,
and it's just not cheap. I mean,
these instruments. So
we have one that's
a $700,000
piece of equipment and
it requires
$100,000 a year
to just to, to
maintain and operate. So,
it's, it's, uh, it's
different than
a hut or, you
know, a more
traditional, uh
low barrier
to entry
industry.
Um, we have very
limited resources here but
you can see on this next
page uh A
BQ ID,
the Bioscience Center in
Albuquerque Stu
Rose, CNM
ingenuity. This is a wonderful
facility and we actually
uh will be drawing from
the, the uh student
body here for in
future employees
uh enterprise Senator
Center in Farmington launch
in Las Cruces,
uh Los Alamos
markers in Los
Alamos, New
Mexico start-up factory
and uh the Santa
Fe Business Incubator, which
is where uh our,
our business is located.
And um
I've been working with
Marie Long Cier at, at
S FBI uh
closely the executive
director. Um
They really need
funding for
equipment, the equipment that they
have was purchased
a decade over a
decade ago. It's
not really
um working
very well right now.
But uh I'll give
you an example of, of
how, how important
this is
about
uh 10 years ago,
the um
New Mexico Consortium
was founded, which was a
collaboration of the
three research universities
in Los Alamos National Lab
in the county of Santa
Fe. They built a
26,000 square
foot state of the art
laboratory uh with
the greenhouse for plant
science.
They've spun out companies
like ubiquity Pebble
labs, trade Biosciences,
um Mercury,
bio etcetera.
And the way that model
worked was that N
MC, which is a nonprofit
would basically rent
lab space with
access to all the shared
equipment that they could
purchase. And
then um the companies
didn't have to buy all this
infrastructure and invest,
they could invest their money in
doing research
and establishing
intellectual property,
but they had the resources to
do the research.
Um And the N MC
would charge them a little bit of
overhead, but that was
it. So
uh we can do
that again, but we
need to be able to put the
money into the infrastructure.
Um And
with that, I
will turn it back over to
Stephanie.
>> So um one
of our project, one of our programs
um that the Bioscience Authority
has led is the Community Readiness
program. And so
this is an Organiz this is
a program that allows us to be
able to identify sites
that are ready to accept bioscience
companies, but there's
land but there's not labs.
And so what we are proposing
is that a capital
outlay project be move
forward to be able to
build WETLAB space that
would be able to double
as an Incubator
accelerator um
program that the
New Mexico Bioscience Authority
would be able to lead. Um
We say this because we are
administratively attached to the University
of New Mexico. We have shared
equipment through them
and shared animal access
that would be able to be
accessible to that type of
space. And we would be
able to lead an accelerator
program to be able to
get people into the resources
that they need to be able to get
to. Um one of the
programs that we've started
in support of this
accelerator program is
the New Mexico Bioscience Connect
Ecosystem A
and so this is an online
platform that is able
to house all of the resources,
organizations, people, events,
jobs, and all of
these news articles that are coming
out about New Mexico
Bioscience. It's a one
stop shop that people can be able
to go to. And with
this um wetlab
and Incubator Accelerator
um building space,
we would be able to
physically help
with, you know, the use
of these resources
to be able to move companies
forward.
A a few more things
that we've been able to see um
just to quickly go
over is that an educated
workforce is needed.
We see that there are a lot
of graduates that are coming out of
New Mexico Universities that
are ready for bioscience
positions. But many
of them either, they don't
know that the jobs are
available because of
the way that they're being
posted. Um They're not
accessible to everyone that's
looking for jobs or
the jobs are so niche
that they think that they're not qualified
for them. We get questions
all the time. We've been going to a lot of
job fairs recently where
we talked to community college
students, we talked to high school students, we
talked to your college
students, we talk to these people and they
say, oh, aren't there,
there aren't any jobs
in New Mexico, there aren't any
bioscience jobs in New Mexico
or I don't want to do, you
know, something that just leaves me in
a lab because they don't
understand what the nuances
of bioscience include.
And so that's one of the reasons that
we really want to work on
developing programming
to be able to get students
that are pursuing bioscience
degrees, to get
experience in those biotech
labs, to be able to get
experience in, you
know, different positions that will give
them research experience hands
on. This is a
clear
programmatic programmatic
effort that has shown
itself to be successful in
other organizations and
states. Um I came from
Georgia Tech there.
It's required all
students have got to have a co
op ex
experience
where they go into the industry
that they're pursuing a degree in to
be able to get at least a semester
of work experience in
there. It helps the
companies to be able to get
the employees that they need right
away. It helps the
students to be able to get that
hands on experience, to be
able to see do I really
want to go forward in this? Do I
want to advance my degree in
this? And it's been able to
show really great success?
So we want to bring that here
to New Mexico and we want it to
be a statewide pro program
that the Bioscience Authority is
able to lead as that state
agency. We're not
just affiliated with UN
M, we have board
members from all across the state.
We represent all of the
state. We want to be able to
work with all of the colleges
and all of the universities to be able
to provide opportunities
for all New Mexico Bioscience
students to be able
to get experience in those
jobs, not only in
bioscience jobs but also in
aerospace jobs that are looking
at space biology.
Um This is a double, double,
you know, focus for us
um on page. I'm
sorry, I'm skipping around because I
was given the, the tip that we
need to speed up on
page 27. Uh
We are looking at
um
uh proposing
an application to the
National Science Foundation
um Excellent program which is
exponential learning for
emerging
and novel
technologies.
Um All right. So uh we're
going to be going for this
program. It's called the Exper
Exper Learning for
Emerging in novel technologies.
It's the National Science Foundation
excellent program.
We're proposing to create
paid internships for
these students to be able
to do a three year pilot
program that would be funded by
the federal agencies.
This is one of the reasons that we say
we need to have that federal
initiatives and we need to be going
forward with them, which
is why we're also asking
for a budget increase.
We can skip over that to
be able to go there really, really
fast. Um Page
31 talks about how
we want to be able to increase
our annual budget because
we need to be able to be working
on these different programs.
We need to have the um
personnel to be able to
help us with these large
Federal initiative
grant opportunities that we
want to go forward with, we
want to be able to contract with investment
analysts so that we're able
to have this professional
entity, you know,
talking to us when
we're partnering with private investment
firms to say this is
a good deal. This is a good
deal for New Mexico. This is a good
deal for the people that are working
on, you know, developing
um their, their
workforce, their strategies
and their business. Uh We
want to hire a Business Accelerator
facilitator and we want
to provide additional internships.
So this year, we were able to hire
two internship interns.
John is one of them. Um
He is working on
um helping us out with our
um Ecom Ma. He's, he's
navigating through it. We're going to be
having um networking
um and training opportunities
later that he's going to be helping to
lead. And so we want to be
able to encourage
internships, not only from UN
M but also from New Mexico
State and New Mexico Tech and then
from others as we, we
continue to be able to
give them real hands-on
job experience
working in the bioscience
industry and economic
development.
Um We
also finally, we want to
be able to support
the New Mexico presence at
national and international
trade shows. This is an
incredibly important piece
that we are missing out on or
we are floundering
to be able to get access
to every year. Um
It's been led in the past
by an mbio.
Um Greg Burns
is also on our board. He's done an
amazing job of putting together
the New Mexico Pavilion
year after year, I've
had the opportunity to
participate in it for the last
three years and I've
been blown away by the
opportunities that there are to
collaborate, to be able to,
you know, bounce ideas off of people,
to be able to get that
experience that we don't
have here in New Mexico.
And they're fascinated by what
we're doing. They're encouraged by what
we're doing and they want to work with
New Mexico companies. But
if New Mexico companies are so
cloistered or not
represented, well,
they're not going to get out
there and they're going to fizzle
out or they're going to move
to places where they can get that
kind of exposure. So we
need to be able to have that the state
needs to be able to support that.
And we want to include that in
our annual budget
request.
Uh Do I have
time to talk about the C suite
pieces
or?
OK, summarizing it
up. So, one
of the other pieces that
we have identified
as, as missing that
Vice Chair Garrett
also pointed out is that we are
also missing executive
level um leadership in New
Mexico. Um So
like um chair
Lore said, we're bringing them in
which is fantastic. We're bringing
in their expertise, we're bringing
in what they're bringing from
um out of state to be able
to come into the state.
But a lot of times that
disconnect also leads
to companies leaving the state
because they want to be closer
to where their CEO is or
where their CFO is. They want to
be closer to that
finance
Umra. And so being
able to educate people
on how to lead
companies is something
that we're really interested in being
able to support as well.
Um The University of New Mexico
is working on a program right now
that would help researchers that are
in the university pursuing
um bioscience related
research to know
how to do the
business setup, not
necessarily to make it so that they
leave the university, but so
they know how to
hire the people to be
able to leave that business
after they
leave.
That is what we're doing. We're
doing some amazing things. So if
you'd like to learn more or talk
more, I'd love to get some questions,
but we thank you so much for your
time and for
this opportunity to present what
we found. >> All right. Well, thank
you to the presenters, outstanding
presentation. Very informative.
We are going to go now to
Representative de la
Cruz,
uh Representative
Chatfield.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. What
an interesting
presentation.
That's something I think we
holds a great future.
So I have two questions.
The first one is, does
bioscience
that has dealt
with by you include
uh biofuel from
algae? And what
is the status of this technology?
Because I know we had some start
ups and then it
wasn't
profitable or whatever.
So I just wonder where are we at
on that?
>> Uh Mr Chair
Representative
Chatfield.
Um,
so I had, I
started a company called Eldorado
Biofuels in
2008.
Uh I was, uh
my partner in the
company was uh Frank
Yates from a ID Petroleum.
We built a pilot project
in Gal, New Mexico
between 2010,
2015
where we demonstrated we could grow
algae and treated, produced
water. Um
Unfortunately, the
price of oil cratered
and we had to shut
that facility down,
but we were
very successful
in uh
developing revenue
streams from
the algae
uh and creating
jobs in an uh
rural
area. Aquaculture
basically. Uh
and um
the economics have
come back
because the price of
oil is up and
also because now
there's ability to get
carbon credits
for taking atmospheric
carbon uh
out. Uh and,
and basically either
recycling it
by burning it as
fuel or
putting it down hole
and say an abandoned brine
well, and basically
taking it out of the atmosphere.
So we did a lifecycle
analysis and we calculated
that uh algae
which is every cell does
photosynthesis,
uh concentrates
co2 up to 16
times the atmospheric
levels. Um
And uh it,
it's more efficient than
mechanical means because
it's a uh
uh biological
thing that just runs
itself.
The uh
interesting part is that
you can take the oil
out uh and
then use the remaining
biomass as
protein for cattle
feed. And we
demonstrated to
uh uh N MS
U that
there's nothing
in the uh algae
that would hurt the cattle,
nothing that,
that there was nutritional
value and that they actually like
to eat it. So
there are ways to do that.
If I had the bandwidth,
I'd go back and reboot that
company. So we just
need some uh start ups,
you know, some entrepreneurs to, to
take it on. But
in our calculations, we
determine that all the atmospheric
carbon emissions in the world
could be sequestered
by a pond
algae upon the size of
Texas. So it's,
it's really doable um
on a global scale
with the
infrastructure,
>> Mr Chair, do you
have a
current estimate of the
breakeven price of
oil to make that
feasible? And
can, can you produce it in
large quantities?
>> Uh Mr Chairman and
Representative Chatfield. Yes.
Um $100
a barrel is sort of like
uh uh the point
where it, it would
be. Uh Well,
that's what we calculated
back, you know, 10
years ago when we were doing
this. Uh again,
at the time, there was not
um carbon
credits that we could
also generate revenue
from. So,
uh if there were II, I
don't know what the number is today,
but uh
the, it, it really
and to answer the second part of
your question,
um So it would be,
I presume less than
$100 a barrel,
but to answer the second
part of your question,
um yes, it's
very scalable,
especially in New Mexico
where we have lots
of flat land in the
Permian Basin area
and in the northeast or
northwest uh San
Juan Basin
uh where
it's not really being utilized
for much more than growing
a cow per square
mile. Um
And it's uh there's
infrastructure there in the
in, in pipelines
and trucking
uh companies.
Uh This is
a materials handling equation
when it comes down to it. So you
need water
and nutrients
and sunlight and flat
land and also
we're far enough inland. So we don't
have the predator uh
pressures that you have
along the coastline where you have
all these little critters
that eat algae. And
so, uh you know,
we have crop protection
here. Plus we have
basic research that's been
done at Los Alamos National
Lab, especially in
genetically modifying
the algae to be able
to, to produce
valuable colos like
basis for plastics
to bioplastics
that could reduce
the uh problems
that plastic cause. So
there's, there's definitely a
way to do that here and
New Mexico has got the great
climate, uh great
great terrain for it and
all this underwater
underground saltwater
that's perfectly feasible
to grow algae
in.
>> You almost waited in the
second place.
What my
face.
Yeah.
>> And if so, what
is New Mexico doing about
it?
>> Uh Mr Chair,
Representative
Chatfield, um
I imagine that's a, that's
a mechanical
energy driven
type of desalination
plant.
Um I
don't think that's bioscience
per
se.
What
>> Mr Chair it is forward
osmosis. Thank
you.
>> OK. Thank you very much. And I'm gonna
ask members to please
truncate questions as much as you
possibly can as well as our
respond. Our presenter
here, Representative
Terrazas.
I had you on my list. I apologize.
Representative Rabal Caballero.
Thank you for all that. Thank you for helping.
Yes, I have you. Representative
Serrato.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair,
who, who to
whomever um can
answer these couple
of questions first.
I think it's
important you you all
talked about and we know
from our various committees,
Mr Chair that
we've been facing loss of
jobs, loss of
businesses and so
forth. I
think
that perhaps
we can change our
language.
For example, we
refer to jobs, jobs,
jobs. And
I'd like to look at
referring to careers,
careers,
careers
because careers
is what is sustainable
and careers
is what is grounded.
So once you come to
establish a career,
you're here to stay.
And so perhaps that can
be something that we begin to
use in lieu
of jobs.
Um That's
my first comment.
So the second is
related Mr Chair.
Uh Now is a
question
how on,
on, for example,
I'm referring to pages
915
and 31.
When we look at
Biosciences
that the state has
targeted, we're
looking at Biosciences,
sustainable and value-added
agriculture and
renewable and green
energy. Uh
I see that that's
this is the wave of the
future. So that's
why our state is
strongly investing
in encouraging
these pathways
for economic development.
And I commend
you because this is the
world of Biosciences
is our future.
So on page
31 you
particularly target
as being um
one of your bullets
providing internships.
If we change our
mindset and our
language from
jobs to
careers, then
I strongly encourage
you to look
at the apprenticeship
pathway
because the
apprenticeship
pathway is what
creates sustainability
and grounded us
and longevity.
And so it's not
really a question but
just a commentary
about how we
can then begin
to address our
long term
sustainability
and address the loss of
jobs and
businesses
and help grow
Biosciences. And by
the way, Mr Chair,
I have four
grandsons and out
of those four grandsons,
two are
potential scientists,
hopefully in this,
in these fields.
And so II
I look forward to this
growth in our state.
Thank you so much, Mr Chair.
>> Uh Thank you uh
madam Representative,
no follow-ups. OK. Uh Representative
Serato.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair.
Thank you uh Panelist
for presenting today. I'll, I'll try to keep
it brief as well. I'm curious
with the clusters that you built
out here on page 21.
Um I'm just
curious if those
are specialized. So for
example, does the Arrowhead Center
specialize in AG Bioscience?
Does the Rio Rancho one
specialize in another type of
bioscience?
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and
um madam Serato
Representative Serato.
Um They do not um
they can include anything.
Um So right now, actually
the, the Las Cruces
um one is in their Industrial
Center and so it
has um both biotech,
it is Pharma and biotech
as well as um
uh health-related
um work. It does not actually
focus a lot on
the AG side. Um
Even though the Arrowhead Center
ones, um they do
have, you know, more
of a, of a presence
in the bio in the
AG science um
fields, the
areas that they've identified
are not exclusive to
those.
>> Uh Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you
uh uh Panelist. Um
I'm also curious, uh
I really appreciate this
presentation. You know, and
I know today we're gonna hear about some other
programs that we have that, you
know, that we've all been investing in
through a lot of our legislation.
Um What is the vision
of the Bioscience Authority of
leveraging those to
improve upon each other? Because
one of the, the, the biggest
frustrations I've, I've had
um as a legislator and really
what a lot of folks here, you know, Senator Paddy
and others have done to, to try
to help
an individual entrepreneur see
the many like
opportunities and
grants and, and uh
incentives we have. So
I'm just curious how you all are
currently or plan to
leverage some of those different
programs.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and
Representative Serato. >> Maybe she
should be on the
board of directors
because that's what we talk about a
lot is how do we
leverage the
resources? We do get
into
information,
informing and
being a resource for what
that looks like in our state.
Because again, our, our
website gives tremendous
traffic from
people across the country that
are looking to locate here and
our ability to connect
them with people.
Resources
is critical. And I
think that's one of the
successes that we've had
as a, as a board, but
also through
Stephanie's efforts,
uh having that kind
of presence I think is really
critical, not just in
the Biosciences, but we could
look at aerospace
intelligent manufacturing.
All of those
clusters need
that same kind of
global exposure
because it's not just national,
it's global.
>> And so one of the um
tools that we've recently
developed that I mentioned
is our um Ecom
Ma. And so it's NM
Bioscience connect.com,
it's an Ecom Ma um that
is also accessible from our website,
which is NM bioscience.org.
Um And that is a
tool where people are
able to find those resources.
And right now, um our intern
John is working on
developing guides to
be able to help
entrepreneurs who
maybe don't know about the
resources, maybe they don't know
about the path that
they can go to to be able to find
those resources. And so
those guides are being created
to be able to help them
navigate through the system more
readily. Because one of
the reasons that we
went for the Small Business
Administration Growth Accelerator
Fund Competition that we were awarded
last year is to
be able to
increase the amount of
transparency of those
resources for all
everyone in the state,
including those that are
outside of the urban
areas where most of the
bioscience work is being
done and to be able to
engage those people
that are in rural communities
or people who have just moved to
the state and don't have
those con those personal connections
that seem to be so valuable
for moving the agenda forward
in New Mexico. And so that's one
of the big things that we want to be able
to do. Um We
take it to all of our
um job
fairs that we are doing. We're working
on engaging um students
and entrepreneurs and all of those
people. >> Thank you, Mr
Chair and last, last brief question
slash I think we of a comment.
First of all, that's wonderful to hear. I
I told my husband when, when we had
our one of our babies, they bring
you everything like fill up this to get social
security. We put a number of fill up
this, fill out that and it's like all
the services come to you right away
at that particular hospital
that we were at seeing more of
that in various places is so important.
The last thing I just want to mention is
that um the story
you you told, sir, I'm trying
to find your name real fast at the end of the
table just about
developing a um a
technology in Santa Fe
and moving to Rio Rancho because they
provided the space
is such a, a long
time story. And I, I really
hope that you all can provide us as
legislators and our and our friends
at the municipality level and
otherwise how
you and I, I think you provided
for that, right. This is the wetlands aspect
and all those, I think that's really important.
Um but, but just
um legislation in other
ways to really improve that
access to land, it gets really
complicated in my district, right. We're very
worried about water access. We're very
worried that, you know, we'll run out of water
as many, much of the state should be.
Um But you know, how do we
protect those, those, those
resources but still
encourage industry to grow.
Um You know, we have different programs like the
C Pace program that we can work
with um uh counties
with. But really your
insights on that, how we can make that
easier. Real Rancho is doing an
incredible job attracting
um industry, you know, because they really
do offer these large plots
and the, the these these
places where people can grow,
businesses can grow. Santa Fe
feels held back, I think
at times. So giving us that
information would be helpful. I apologize. I went
along. Thank you, Chairman.
>> Thank you all. Good representative. Thank you very
much, Representative
>> Block.
Thank you Mr Chair. Thank
you Mr Chair and thank you all for being
here. I will try to be as brief
as I possibly can.
So I'm just gonna go to slide
11 and it's a map
of all the companies
that are starting
up in New Mexico
or active in New
Mexico. And I
see
there's some in Clovis
and I'm wondering if those are due
to the base, the Air
Force Base or maybe the
close vicinity to
Texas and, and
areas like that because
I live in Almo, Gordo and
we're pretty close to uh
Las Cruces, we're pretty close to
El Paso. And I was just
wondering uh
if that
was potentially a reason
why you had such an investment in
those communities. And if so
how can we mimic that
in a community like ours,
Mr Chair, whoever
wants to answer
that?
>> Thank you so much, Mr Chair
and Representative Block. Um So,
one of the reasons that um
so, so this map
just a
follow up with
that is that this map is a living
breathing map
because even though we are, the Bioscience
Authority companies do not come
to us when they, when they start
up and say like, hey,
we're here, please put us on your
map a lot of times we're
finding them and we're,
we're, we're exploring,
you know, what is available through the
state. Um Right now, we're
really fortunate that our other
intern that we have this summer is
actually in Clovis. And
so he is the one that is doing
the, the report of
looking at the bioscience.
Um The grow bio report
and, and analyzing the companies
that are listed in that
report. And so I'm
gaining a lot from his insight
about what is available in
his area. So he's
looking at, um
you know, all of those different
locations. Uh One
of the things we've seen about Clovis,
um in terms of community
ready is the
um railroad,
the, the being a
railroad hub is very
beneficial to it, being
a community readiness site, which
is why we've reached out to them
to identify sites that are
ready to accept bioscience
companies, but also the
dairy industry um
that is a really big um
topic for bioscience
and for um animal feed,
for animal production
and all of those different pieces that go
into the sustainable agriculture
piece of the Biosciences.
And so that's, that's why
that is there.
Um
We want to engage all
municipalities and so
I work really hard to be able to
engage with the economic
development um people
and with the local
um leadership. And so I
would love to um
con connect with
anyone that you think would be valuable
for us to um
meet with and to learn more
about our community readiness
program um to be able
to identify sites that are
ready to accept bioscience companies
so that we can share that
information more readily with.
Um and in partnership with
the different economic development
organizations, including the State's
Economic Development Department,
put it on our website to be
able to help with um
broadcasting and sharing
those
opportunities,
>> Mr Chair and Representative
Block. I think the most
important thing that can be done right
now to make the Bioscience
Authority relative
relevant is
to, to invest in the
Coves fund.
As Stephanie mentioned, companies
don't come to us looking for
assistance.
Um If we had
a a fund, they would
definitely be knocking on our
door.
Thank you. >> Thank you
Mr Chair and thank you both for
those answers. And I think that's super
critical to just see
what, what different places
in our state have to
offer because in Alamogordo,
I mean, we have a lower cost of living
than Santa Fe. So not
to poach any of
representative Serato's
constituents, but if you want to
come visit us in
Alamogordo, it's, it's a little
cheaper than Santa Fe and we
have so many resources. We
have so many uh office spaces
and, and spaces available and
like we were talking about earlier,
the space to do what
we need to do is critical
especially to, to create
a giant or hopefully
a giant business that's growing
and prospering and investing
in our communities. That's
exactly what we need.
So another quick question
and then I, I will shut up, I
promise Mr Chair. So
on that same map, it
talks about New Mexico State
University as a
partner with some
of these uh these groups
or these businesses that are
building in New Mexico.
So I'm wondering does that include
the other satellite
campuses such as New Mexico
State, Almog Gudo?
Great.
Yes, thank you
so much. I really appreciate that. Thank you,
Mr Chairman. That's all I had.
>> Thank you, Representative. We'll go to
Representative Lujan. Thank
>> you, Mr Chair. I'd like to
be sure, but this is a huge
conversation because I believe
as we talked about this is where
we need to be building our
economy and first
and foremost, in
order to build our economy, we need
infrastructure, we need
water, plain and
simple. Uh what you are
doing and what you're asking of us
today is you want an increase
in your budget to $1 million
and a an additional $50
million for Coves program. Is
it so chair is the
$50 million for the match
program. Is that correct?
So my question
is as you're
working to
um
to the success of what you
are, what you are doing.
Where are you
working
primarily with our labs?
Sandia lab, Los Alamos,
um labs
and those because
they are incubators. And I've
been talking with some of the
scientists that are there that are
creating
incredible
bioscience
technology
and they can
have as many
patents as they want
rather than having going
into the private industry
because they have,
they have the incubation
if you will from the labs
and they have that infrastructure.
Um My next question would
be
um
when do you, I think it
goes to some of these other questions. First
answer that Mr Chair.
>> Um Thank you,
Mr Chair and, and
Representative Luhan.
Um So
Mercury Bile has a collaborative
research agreement with Los Alamos
National Lab. Uh
We're doing modeling
of the technology that I
just described earlier
in silico in the
computers there using
their uh
supercomputers
and it's, it's
incredibly helpful and this
DARPA grant I mentioned
or sorry contract
proposal we
submitted uh Los Alamos
lab and as is
un M uh
Pharmaceutical Division
and uh National
Center for Genomic Resources,
Genome Resources in
Santa Fe are all subcontractors
on this proposal.
So we, it's, it's an
incredibly great
asset >> for. That's great. I'm
going to cut you off there because we have aluminums,
you do have working relationship
with them. That's, that's really what I'm
asking. So the next question
would I I would
like to just bring to your attention
since you are. I hear you're working with our
higher education
institutes as well, primarily
UN M. So I
gave seed money uh
working with our local government
in Santa Fe where, where I
represent for the
Doe Collaboration
Center, which sounds
a lot of what you,
what I really want to say. Thank
you for being a
facilitative unit
if you will. Uh it's
a little oxymoron there,
but you are, you are
trying to integrate and, and connect
everybody together. But
with the U and M,
we put the seed money with the
school Anderson
school and
to help create these jobs
and to, to move forward
to create a
actual
brick and mortar
center so that
we can have a place where we
are doing this facilitative bioscience
work specifically.
And so the reason why we put it at
the CMON at Anderson
was to, to
give them the start up if you will
again to, to really
investigate and how we're gonna
uh create these, this jo
these jobs, how we're
going to
create a board around these?
And, and I don't, my question is,
have you been working with U
and M or the Doe
Collaboration Center? Because you
also mentioned Santa
Fe um
Institute as well. There's I have
so many notes. I mean,
I was just writing everything down
on my thoughts and everything is coming to,
to mind and how
you're, how you're
putting this together because it, it's really
the innovation that we need for
um the problem that
you are trying to solve, which is
diversification of our
economy, please.
And that's all I have after that, Mr
Chair,
>> this is a difficult
one. Mr Chair,
Representative
Luhan. Um Thank
you. Um
that's a difficult one.
So, so
to, to the first question
regarding a commercialization
of technology out of
the national labs, one
of the challenges is,
and
Paul pointed out, Stephanie
pointed it out as well
is actually the ability
to start out fresh
to basically provide
if you want the light
at the end of the tunnel that there is funding
available to start out
something within the
state, take a technology
out of a well funded
national lab and start
here immediately.
So to basically if you
want to take the
attractiveness of
other states out of the
equation, so
that's one
that will fundamentally help
to actually
commercialize
technology within the state.
The other thing is yes.
Um One thing is
absolutely crucial and this is
a and this
is what we
try to
present
very
open, very transparent
collaboration between the
national labs, between all universities
existing programs.
Because at the end,
we have the ability to leverage
those very
quickly. And there's
no need to re invent the
wheel by
basically setting up
a level that
allows everybody to collaborate
and work together
including in existing
centers. Of course,
>> thank you, Mr Chair and I just want to say
because you, you serve on
a Senate finance, I serve on
house appropriations
with this $50 million
that they're asking for,
for additional, additional
to the 25 that we've already given them.
This would be a nonrecurring, I
assume. And
I would ask, we put a
whole huge
amount of money into,
uh, matching fund
this last session with
DF. Would
that, would it behoove
us to have a discussion about
taking this money that they're
asking for and putting into that
program? And how much access
have they had to that matching
um uh program
with DF as, as
of today? Because
the fiscal year started
yesterday. And I would
ask that we, we, you
collaborate with us because
these are the things we're gonna be looking at,
we're putting our budget together.
So this is an additional matching
fund. We, we just set aside
a huge amount of money
and DDA A is managing
that and those that
came to our committees
were in mass
talking about our Biosciences
and our diversification for
our economy. But we really know
where those dollars need to be going into
our local communities for,
for their infrastructure
issues, for their waterman
management issue. So this
is in addition to that Mr Chair, I'll
end with that. Thank you very much.
>> Thank you representative and I
couldn't agree more with your
comments, but, but there's a
lot of parts of state government where
we need to be having those conversations.
So, thank you very much. We'll
now go to Vice
Chair Garrett.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and I was going to
start with that 50 million because
I'm sure we'll see you
at LLFC
and H AFC.
So I'll start with my second
question on
the
um
the planning and building funds
to develop the Wet Lab and
Incubator Accelerator Space.
Have you gone to
NM A's
Opportunity
Enterprise Fund? Talking to
Marquita Russell and her team
because building
on spec is one of the
roles of that money,
they just awarded seven grants.
It seems it would fit in.
Have you? OK.
Just I suggest you talk to
them and they're all here
today behind
you. Um And
then my third question
um is
on the increase
uh the budget
um You stated that you want money
for internships
and that type of
thing, we
put money in the house bill
two budget specifically
for student
internships.
So in asking for that
million, I want to
suggest that you investigate
that internship fund
because exactly what you
want it for is what it's
there for it.
It might reduce by
200,001 1
million. And,
and as representative
Lujan said, a bunch of us
are going to see you again.
And so do talk to
our wonderful New Mexico Finance
Authority about the
opportunity enterprise for
building
and higher education
about the internship money
because there's a lot of money there.
Thank you.
>> Um, may I respond
briefly? Yes, thank you. Just
to, just to be clear, uh,
Chairman and
Representative Louhan,
the, uh, the $25
million that was approved two
years ago, uh,
that was vetoed by the governor.
So we did, we do not have
any funding right now.
And, uh, it was
the, the bill we tried to,
we revised it, brought
it back last year, but it was
not on the agenda.
So it didn't get hurt. So
we're going to give it another shot this
year and, and uh
I hope we can get it
past uh everyone.
Thank you. >> So did my
level best to help you with that one
myself personally. Just so, you
know, um I saw some
shaking heads. Did you want to make any more
comments on the?
No.
OK. Uh Vice chair, anything
else? OK.
Thank you very much. Um I
just had a quick
17 questions of my own.
Just um
are biomass
projects. Uh Are
those also considered bioscience
projects? OK.
So, you know,
I I'm gonna ask
you for your opinion because I, I did
have a little tiny bill several years
ago that got run over, then backed
over and then run over again
to make sure that they got it that
year.
So this was between the 15
and 17 sessions a while
back. So if
we had been able to run
some very significant biomass
production in New
Mexico,
where the fires are concerned
right now with these flooding that we're
seeing, would that have it all
helped with the
management of the, the
water as it came
into like, say the Roos
so community and
you know, I just want to say, guys,
this is a huge deal.
This could be a large
industry here in New Mexico
providing thousands of jobs
but also
um
help to avoid these disasters
that we seem to be seeing. Does anybody want to comment
for about two minutes on that
>> quickly? I was one of the founders
of the Rio Grande Water
Fund with the Nature
Conservancy. And that was one of the
goals. You probably
have one of the greatest
state foresters
in our state, Laura mccarthy.
Yes, you're exactly
spot on Senator.
Our forests need
to be managed
and the way to
avoid extreme
fires which cause
hydrophobic soils, which
means that when it does rain
after fire, who thinks
fire and floods, right?
The the soil turns into
glass, they burn so hot
because there's so much biomass.
So if we could harvest
the biomass out
of the forest,
manage our forests,
do the kinds of things that our
state forester recommends.
Uh we could possibly
avoid those extreme
fires and climate
change is only going to exacerbate
the problems. So if our state wants
to have outdoor
recreation tourism and
those kinds of things, we
better get busy as a state
managing our forests
and because it also protects
our uh >> groundwater.
Well, thank you. Uh
Dale, you and I
are good buddies outside of all of this.
I think I'd like to say that
I would like to bring that bill back if
you would take a look at my legislative
website and it's
there. I want to say it's 1516
or 17 and you and I can work on that
together and others on this
committee who wants to help with that. I
would invite you to the table
to work on. This is a
huge job creator,
you know, did you
have a comment?
Um But all right, that,
that's about it. That's all I had. Thank
you so much for your presentation today.
You did wonderful. Um
We look forward to having you back
again and I do believe that
we should on that funding
piece. We should definitely
attempt to get that done into 60
because we have a longer period
of time to discuss it, debate it,
understand it and get
everybody else because you're going to see a whole
new cast of characters in
January. And let me tell
you they're going to be characters.
So, thank you very
much. Uh So now we'll go
on to
um
yeah, keep bugging us on that one until
it's done. So we're going to go to item
number three now. But uh while we ask
the presenters to come up, that's going to
be um the super
terrific. Wonderful
Marquita Russell, everybody
performing at CNM,
the CNM campus today, Chief
Executive Officer in New Mexico Finance
Authority. I do want to
ask uh represent, I'm
sorry, Pinto to introduce
herself while MS
Russell's on her way up.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair members of the
committee. Good morning. And
those on our webcasts. I'm
Senator Shannon Pinto. I represent
District three, which is
in the northwest corner of the state.
It's great to be here. Thank you, Mr
Chair. Thank >> you very much, Senator
for getting here. You helped us make
that,
that
the quorum
we needed a little while ago. And then
also want to recognize uh Senator
Griggs who I think is out of the room, but
we'll try to come back to him here in a little
bit. Uh but we're gonna
have uh
literally the
International Super
Sensation,
several presentations
today. Uh Marquita Russell,
Chief Executive Officer of New Mexico
Finance Authority on item number three
to the committee update on the venture
capital program. Thank you.
Oh, and I do want to let the committee know
that lunch is going to be here
on or about 11 fiftyish,
which could be 1150 or
1205 or 1155
but it will be here soon for you. Thank
you, the taps and the wine
room will not be open though. Sorry,
take it
away.
>> Is this on? Ok, thank
you. Um So,
uh Mr Chairman,
I'll be speaking from a
powerpoint presentation that
I think you've been delivered.
Um And my goal today is to
update you on our venture
capital program
and what we've been able to achieve. I'm
gonna ask for your
forgiveness upfront or some
kindness. Um I
don't normally run this program.
This is not my program
and our technical expert is
on holiday. So,
um I'm pinch hitting for
Ryan Marie Decker
and I hope to do um some
justice to this because we've done some great
things. Um So
I'll just start on page two and to
remind you that the venture
capital uh program Act
was created a
couple of years ago
and then was substantially
amended uh last
year in 2023.
Um It provides us with
right now, $50 million of
state funding and
about $15 million
of federal uh state
Small Business credit
initiative dollars. Um
So we have about $65
million that we're currently working
with maybe up to 70
million depending on how the
final allocation of
that, of those federal dollars
um occur. Our
goal is to our, our
directive is
to make investments in New Mexico
businesses that enhance
economic development objectives
and create jobs.
Um We are to provide
capital for start-up
expansion,
product or market development,
recapitalization or early
stage development.
Um Notably, we
can make both direct
investments
and investments
into venture private equity
funds. Those are fund
managers. Um We
have focused solely on
the second which is um
making those
investments into equity
fund managers. And I'll spend
uh some time
uh going through
um some
of those, those investments
to date and, and what we've seen in the
marketplace
um by
statute, an investment
cannot exceed more than
10% of our
total equity and
one industry cannot exceed
more than 30%.
And we are to report
annually
um on page
three, I think we've given
this presentation before an update,
but I'll remind you that we operate
our program utilizing
a formal, a set of rules
and a formal investment
policy as well
as a staff
um uh
investment committee.
So we vet all the transactions
that come through. They go up to
our board first to a committee
of the board and then ultimately to the board
itself to make that determination
as to whether or not to
make the investment, the
investment policy
um outlines management
qualifications, investment
parameters as well as
the program mission and
diversification objectives.
Um And I'll just highlight
those very briefly, they are to
create and invest in
new early stage and expanding
New Mexico businesses,
create a retain quality job
for New Mexicans. Increase
investment in diverse
sectors of the state economy. That's
an important factor
um increase
access to capital for
businesses owned by
entrepreneurs from
or benefiting underserved
communities and to
attract additional private
sector investment in early
stage and emerging businesses.
One of the changes that you made
about two years ago in
2023 was
to allow for NM FA to
explicitly make
differential uh rate
investments. So we can
actually invest in,
in funds that will likely
not return a market
investment, but will in
fact achieve greater
economic development benefits.
And what you'll see is that we've
kind of straddled that we've got a
mix of market
rate and below market rate
investments in
our portfolio.
Uh We operate our
program with a
consultant that we selected
via competitive RFP
process. Uh The,
the group is called
Makita. They are
um international
um uh venture
capital uh
consultant
and they will do, they
both help us vet those
transactions. They do a complete due
diligence of every
transaction that we
give a green light to, to say
we'd like to look at that investment
and they'll do the back
office uh report
management of it. So they'll get the
reports over from
the fund managers.
They'll synthesize those and
give us direct reports as
well as provide us with a dashboard
of information at our
fingertips at the point at which we're actually
starting to get some real
data coming in.
A
and they've been truly
helpful when I'll just
remind you that when this bill
was introduced in
2022.
Um It was not at
NM A's
behest factly
frankly, we didn't know that it was
being proposed until
three days before the session
started. And I did
not panic because in fact, I
had on staff Ryan
Marie Decker who, you know,
comes from a social
impact investing
background. We have two
of our legal counsels, one that
was a legal counsel at the State
Investment Council and the
other who was general counsel at
the per A.
So they two of those council
had significant experience.
I have two people that have run
private equity venture funds
on staff currently as well. So
I didn't panic,
but I do want to make
certain, we know that the management
gods smile upon
you and sometimes they don't.
And so if any of those
folks were ever to leave, we
would be kind of
stuck. So we
chose to use
someone like Makita
so that we could have some
consistency in staffing
across that program.
So if in fact, we
are unfortunate to lose
one of those really key people,
we still have the ability to
operate the program,
the way that you hoped we
would.
So so far, our strategy
has been really
in four areas to
anchor new investments
in New Mexico that focus
on New Mexico businesses
with flexible debt,
um to invest
in emerging fund
managers,
to invest with national firms
with highly aligned mission
and footprint in New Mexico.
And as I mentioned earlier,
to have a mix of both market
rate and below market rate
investments. And our goal
here is to get as much capital
back into the fund so that we
can make additional
um investments
on page four because we are,
in fact, I think
the legislature asked us to
take this program on because we are
different than other,
other venture firms would be,
we won't be so focused
on market returns,
but in fact, more on economic
development and uh
returns. So
I wanted to just give you a highlight of what
we have in our investment
on page four, you'll see on the
left hand side, our objectives.
Um And I've read those off for you
before. Um But
in the first objective to create
and invest in new early
stage and expanding businesses,
we are looking specifically
at the dollars deployed
and the number of new Mexico
investments, uh New
Mexico businesses invested
and we're looking at uh
the dollars deployed as a
percentage of New Mexico
businesses at a specific
stage in the company's
life. We
are looking for economic
impact measures. For
the second one to create and retain
quality jobs. For New Mexico,
we will be counting the
actuals part-time
and full-time equivalents that are
created and retained in New Mexico.
We'll be collecting data on the
salary and employee benefits
as well as the diversity
on staff and in hiring
practices
uh for the third objective
to increase the investment in diverse
sectors of the state's economy.
We'll be looking specifically
at the dollars deployed as a
percentage of the number
of companies in
the economic developments,
targeted industry
sectors and
the number of dollars
deployed in uh
as a percentage of New Mexico
businesses at the stage of
company in that
sector.
Um The fourth one
again to increase capital for
businesses owned by entrepreneurs
are benefiting from underserved
communities. And I did
not publish the
um the definition
of underserved communities. It's
a long definition, but it
looks at both geographic and
demographic uh
population
um
characteristics.
And we're looking in that instance,
we'll be measuring uh the
portfolio company
ownership and control by
individuals from those underserved
communities as well as the
diversity of the management and
staff. Um And then
lastly to attract additional
private sector investment in
early stage and emerging
businesses, this is a really
important one because it's
not necessarily the first investment
that makes the difference although it
does, but getting them additional
capital once they start to take
hold and, and uh take
seed. So that is an
important factor and we look
very specifically at that so
that we can ensure that these
businesses are given
both the technical expertise
as well as the additional capital
to complete their growth.
Um And we'll be looking there
at the dollars of follow on
capital invested, the
number of institutional investors
in the portfolio companies
and the percentage of out of state
investors in portfolio
companies. So again, trying
to rely on more than just
New Mexico dollars
in these
investments.
Um On page five, I'll
go through just the basic
parameters. Um This
is, as I said,
Makita does very
professional um
due diligence and we are
looking very much at
the key personnel as well as the
front and back office operations
because we need to make
certain that there is the
ability for them to operate
this fund in the, in the issue
that a key manager
leaves. Um
So we're looking for
uh investment experience and
capacity for the
kinds of businesses that they're
targeting um
their ability to meet prac uh
meet best practices for
operational reporting
and compliance standards.
Um Sustainability, both
from a budget perspective and
staffing perspective,
any mitigated efforts for
key man risk and succession
planning, um
adherence to conflicts of interest,
policies and
alignment with the funds that we have
under management. That's
a particularly important one
if they aren't aligned with
our mission that they are not
going to get past our first
vetting.
Um
We have concentration limits set
out in um in our
policies. I would note that
our expected
investment is between two
and $10 million.
Uh We can't exceed more than
20% of the balance of the
fund at the time of approval.
So we are looking for,
you know, 5 to 10
investments ultimately.
Um Typically, we're looking
for funds that are uh
seeking to have
a minority or noncontrolled
interests in the
fund in the business.
Um
And fund
investments cannot or
shall not exceed 50%
unless under very specific
circumstances.
So that's what the
policy provides. That's the,
the basis upon which we are
vetting. We'd note
that there's
um
we use a standard,
we use standard documentation
from the Institutional
Limited Partners Association.
They have standard terms. We use a
side letter in each of these
instances. So if there are specific
deal points that we need
included, they are
contained in a side letter. So
particularly as it relates to
staffing presence
in New Mexico,
um any consultants they might
use in New Mexico, that's all
explicitly provided in a side
letter. So we do contract for
that. It's just not in the first
fund.
We've seen some challenges
both um by looking
in-state because we're still at a very
early stage in New
Mexico for fund
managers. Um
So on page six, I'll
just kind of highlight some
of the pros and cons
of both the local
funds and the national funds that
we found. Um
obviously from the pro
side. Uh there is
significant impact by
um investing in local
managers. We're
getting, we are sure
that we're getting investment in local
businesses. We
are um looking
at targeted capital gaps
at different stage and we're
building the capacity which is
critically important in this
ecosystem of
um local fund
the risks are um
that in New Mexico, particularly
right now, given that we're at such an early
stage, honestly,
uh we have a lack of sector
or strategy investment
experience. Um So we
have some folks that are good at specific
things, but there's not a broad
base of investors
that uh can meet the
kind of diverse needs of
New Mexico. There's
a lack of investor base. A
lot of the investment in New
Mexico funds comes from
the State Investment Council.
Now the venture capital uh
program
um because of the limited
size, any loss, obviously,
um skew some of that, but we have
seen some poor track records
to date. Uh The
fund sizes tend to be pretty
small. So there's a lack of
ability to do some follow on
capital. Uh
They are generally
thinly staffed um
because these are small funds
and, and new endeavors.
Um So we're not entirely
certain how sustainable they
are. Um And
there can be conflicts of interest
given that it's a small market.
So there's a lot of significant
uh uh impact that,
but there are some risks that we
are trying to
balance on
the national side. We
will see more
sector and strategy
expertise. Um
We will see larger funds
that can deploy more capital
to each portfolio company
as in including
follow on capital.
Um They can attract
new private
investors so we can bring
outside investment dollars to New
Mexico. We can connect
these local entrepreneurs
with industry and investor
networks as they try
to grow their
businesses. We
obviously are able to balance
better the risk and return
profile of our
portfolio
and we can coves
if we have a National fund
investor, a fund
manager, we're able we get a
first shot at
COVES. There are
significant risks as
well.
Uh Most
significantly, national
funds cannot make firm
dollar commitments to New
Mexico
unless it's explicit in
the fund documentation.
And when you have the numbers
of investors that they typically
have in their funds, it's
unusual or unlikely that
they're going to have a carve out for
a specific state.
Um So as a result, they may deploy
elsewhere uh when the
relative benefits are better
for the portfolio
before I jump into.
Lastly, the projects that we've invested
to and date, which is to date, which
is the fun part of this.
Um There are
additional parameters on page
seven here which are
that um our local funds
which again are going to target at
least 90% of the
capital to New Mexico
businesses.
Um We cannot
exceed more than 60%
of the total fund commitments
and we require a
70%
match from
public or private
capital. And if it's SS
BC I, those federal dollars
to be 1 to 1 and it has
to be all private capital. That's
a rule of the Feds.
Um, on the national side, we
can't exceed more than 20%
of the fund total fund commitments.
Um And right now
I can tell you that, uh,
of the four
national funds that we're looking
at, we are a total
of 2% of the targeted
investment uh fund
size. We
require a 1 to 1 match
from private sources for those
national funds and they
must be able to
demonstrate
investment expertise,
um prior
investments or pipeline in New
Mexico locally
based resources or
formal commitments to staffing,
presence office hours
or educational events. So
two of those four things have to
occur before we'll even
consider a fund,
uh an investment and national
fund. All
right now to the
real money page, the fun part
uh to date, we have
looked at about
50 projects.
Um We have done initial
vetting on 50.
We've advanced uh nine
to full diligence
and have approved eight.
So far we've brought eight to the
board um
and they've approved all of them.
One of them however, has
not uh was
not able to close within
the 120 days
that are outlined in our
portfolio uh in our
investment policy.
So we are actively looking
to replace
that particular
investment with another
similar investment which will
be a New Mexico based
where we are the lead investors
and there's flexible um debt
and equity provided.
So our first investment was to
tramway venture partners. They're
located in Albuquerque.
It's a women owned business
uh fund that's investing
equity in early stage
new Mexico businesses and the
Biosciences sector.
Um The New Mexico
Opportunity Fund, which was that
fund that we were unable to
close on. The
goal of that was to invest
equity and flexible
debt in early
stage businesses in diverse
sectors that are often
traditionally overlooked by
venture capital.
Um Advance
New Mexico last year.
Actually, in this very room, you heard
a presentation from
um the
what's called Nec Street and
they were a consultant that did an
ecosystem uh
report capital
report for us and
we used that report to
help build AAA
Bespoke
Fund. This advanced New
Mexico was built on the
back of the research that was
done by Net Street.
Um And they will be
investing
debt, flexible
debt in growing early
stage New Mexico
businesses uh
targeting specifically
underserved entrepreneurs
and diverse uh sectors
overlooked by traditional
VC. I would note that
this is not a high interest
rate um vehicle
for uh the
businesses. That's the good
news. The bad news is
it's a low return for
N MA as a result.
So someone has to pay for this
kind of funding. Um
And the goal here is to grow
the business. So the business won't be
paying high interest rates
on these flexible debt
products. But NM fa
will have a lower rate of return
on that one.
Um An
important one that we invested in
was Raven Indigenous
Impact Fund. This was
their second fund. It is
actually um based
in uh Canada.
So it is a
large fund that uh
invests late see in
early stage capital
to innovative scalable
purposed driven indigenous
enterprises. So it is for
indigenous um
entrepreneurs.
Um they actually had
closed on their fund
and because of New Mexico's
footprint and our role
in New Mexico, they opened the
fund up and allowed us to
come in after they had
done a close. So they had to, they
had $100 million targeted
investment. They reached
that uh fundraise
pretty quickly. And
then they were made aware of New
Mexico's uh program
and they got the
consent to
increase it to 100 and seven.
So we were able to put in
$7 million. They
actually have hired a person in
Albuquerque to help
source deals. So we expect
that this is both, it's
international because it's both
Canada
and
the United States, we
expect a significant portion
to end up in the New Mexico
Southwest area.
Another fund which is an
emerging fund, dangerous
ventures. They'll
invest in sustainable and
resilient future for people
and planets. Then they're targeting
early stage investments
in New Mexico
in, in New Mexico businesses in
the climate tech world.
Um It is a brand new
fund. One of the
um uh the from
three very seasoned
uh fund
managers and entrepreneurs.
One of them is located
in Lives in
Santa Fe
um Vamos Ventures.
Um It's a national fund.
Uh They provide capital
to Latino owned businesses
and those with diverse
teams um
usually um
through scalable tech
driven companies.
Um An interesting one that
we just approved
and not yet closed, but we expect
to close by the end of
July is
Tiverton ag legacy
holding funds and
they invest
large uh
capital in
agriculture production and
infrastructure. So their
typical is
20 to $50 million
and they will help um
scale up and
professionalize
large agricultural
businesses. They have one transaction
in New Mexico already
though it's a National fund. We
expect our small commitment to
there uh to be matched
3 to 4 times
and then lastly rethink
impact, which is a women
owned uh a fund for,
it's a women owned fund for
women owned businesses
that use tech, enable
uh
companies to solve the
challenges of the world. That's
a latest stage
series c follow
on capital fund.
So you'll see here that we've
got diverse um
mission objectives,
uh indigenous women owned
businesses, Latino owned
businesses, uh
uh uh climate
control. Um
And you'll see that we have a mix
of both national and
local funds as well
as where they are in their stage of development
from seed to follow on
capital.
Um, on page
nine, you'll
see our
commitments to date. So we've approved
about 50 $51
million Masser Menos.
Um, and that is
about 75% of
the funds that have been made
available. Uh,
half of those commitments
are in national funds.
Half of those commit commitments
are in state funds,
um, of the state
funds. Uh,
you'll see on the,
uh the left-hand side
of page nine,
it's about 48%
of the total capital or
63% of the investments
we've made to date.
Um And our
commitments to those
funds total,
35% of
the expected targeted fund
size for all of those for
the combined raise
on the national side, as I mentioned
earlier. Um It's
about 28% of our
current
portfolio. Uh
37% of the
investments that we've approved
to date
and our
commitments equal about
2% of the
total targeted fund
sizes. So we're taking
a much smaller piece of
a bigger uh pool of
capital.
Uh You'll see on this side, on the
right hand side of that,
um the, the
actual fund itself and how much
it represents. Um
Again, noting that there are
combinations of
debt and equity, combinations
of uh seed to
follow on capital
and um
diverse sectors
and
strategies.
Uh One more way to look at this portfolio
on page 10 is by the
way in which we have funded
them. So on the left-hand
side are the state dollars
you have allocated $50
million. Uh We have
approved 28.5
million of that.
Um Again, some of those
are to national funds. The
state fund has far more
flexibility than
the federal fund does. The
federal fund has
very stringent requirements
on where this capital can be
invested. So we
cannot use. Um
We can't invest the, the
federal funds outside of
New Mexico. So most of
the federal funds you'll see
tramway almost ventures,
dangerous ventures, those
are all targeted to New Mexico
businesses.
Um
And I think
I just to highlight uh the
current pipeline. So we still have
about 16 $18
million again, depending on how the
federal dollars shake
out. Um And
we are looking at
lending to local farmers that
are transitioning to organic
um markets.
Uh We have the potential there to
leverage some philanthropic
dollars and to
include technical assistance
for those local farmers.
We're looking at um
another woman owned uh
business
fund um
below market
rate funding there,
we are looking to leverage
again philanthropic
dollars and to bring an
accelerator someone to actually
help grow those um
businesses.
Uh There's a fund that
we're looking at that will focus
on rural businesses,
um particularly
seed fund
and one for consumer
sector businesses that's currently
on our pipeline.
We're looking at a business
that provides
funding for tribal health
care.
Um And then
lastly, we're still,
we continue to look at local
tech funds because
those are obviously a key part of New
Mexico's um
industries.
Uh in all of these,
we're looking to
um leverage both
private capital,
philanthropic capital
and we are very
careful not to
invest
too frequently or too
much aside
the State Investment Council.
So both the State Investment
Council was in that first
transaction for Tramway.
We see very little overlap.
Otherwise our staff,
Ryan meets with the
State Investment Council and the Economic
Development Department
very frequently, I think
weekly. Um to assure
that we are uh
not doubling
up the capital from New Mexico
into these funds so that
we're getting a more diverse
spread of the
funds across the fund
managers and
sectors.
And Mr Chairman, that
is the
update.
>> Thank you, uh Marquita.
I just want to make sure before we
go to any questions and
comments on
slide, 10 bottom right hand
side, is that a typo
or is that really dangerous
ventures?
What we need to do is drop the word
investment in the middle of dangerous
ventures. And I
think we really have something there.
Ok. So, um
so we'll go first to Representative
Chatfield.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair,
uh Mr Chair. Some
of you all in this room are aware
of my
uh struggle to
get in-state
beef inspections on
the boat. We were able to
accomplish that last year
and uh to place
a department in
New Mexico
State University,
which uh
whose job
is strictly to help
people get through the
red tape and all
the rules and rigs to
put in a packing
house. Uh Our
beef industry in New Mexico
is highly vulnerable
to anything that happen
on one of the big three
hackers a
fire
uh shut down and, and
drove our
cabs
price down
uh in a period of a couple
of days. Uh
COVID uh threatened
to bankrupt our
industry because of
they were going to shut down some of
the big packing houses.
A lot of these, these
guys uh
uh process
2500 beams
a day.
They, they
employ hundreds of thousands
of employees.
So our drive
is to get
mid-sized packing
houses. No, we don't want to get
to the, to the, where
we are creating the old, the
same problem again.
But we need packing houses
that process more than three
a week. We need 100
and 25 a day
probably. And we
have one in Roswell that
processes 100 and 25
a day. We
have uh one in
Raton that's really
uh coming
up. I'm not sure the
their numbers,
but they, they really do
a good job and they have a lot
of business. Most of these
guys are booked even
a year out uh to
custom process folks
beef. So
it's been a huge
project.
And uh so right now, we
have in-state beef
inspections uh
which means we do not have to
have a uh
USDA inspector. We
have a N MD A inspector.
Uh We have
commitment from economic
development to some extent the
help of the packing houses.
Uh And we have a few
start-ups.
I'm looking at this
uh
a legacy holdings
fund, has
any of it uh gone
to push forward uh
some of the
packing house industry
in New Mexico.
>> So Mr Chairman, they have not
yet closed on their funds. So they have
not yet made that
particular fund
run by Tiverton has
not yet made any investments.
Their particular
strategy is to
find
um agricultural
businesses where there is
no succession planned.
So farm, you know,
family farms, large
agricultural enterprises
where the Children no
longer want to be in that
industry, they don't want to be
farmers. Um They recognize
how hard the work is
and there's just, you know,
the farms at the end of
its life unless there's a
someone to take over that
farm. Um So their
actual strategy is to go
in and take over
own those farms.
Um and kind of prof
professionalize them, you know, put
them on payroll
systems, um
you know, improve some of
the mechanics of
the, of the agricultural
business, whether that's
um irrigation or
some other processing element
and then ultimately to try to
scale it up to its maximum
capacity. So their goal
is to keep those business, those
farms, um those
agricultural businesses
in place
as a result of no,
no succession being
in place. Um So that's
their strategy. They
uh that's for this
one and it's an equity
strategy, debt
strategies. And I don't know if
they've done one of those in New
Mexico, I understand they
did a debt
product in for
a dairy farm, but
I don't know that they've done
anything for meatpacking.
But we continue to look
at other
funds, other fund
managers that
have experience
in agriculture
because we think it's an important
part. It's not something that traditional
VC folks look at
because it takes a very
specific um
uh spec
specialization,
that's a lot of
art as well. As science.
And so it's not um
often um
you don't see a lot of them out there, but we
are looking, uh
we're even talking about
whether or not we should just create one
that might be the easier way to do it, but
we'd obviously have to have the fund manager
that does that. So my, that's
my long answer to say
no, we haven't. I don't
believe they've done that.
>> So Mr
Chair
sounds like these guys are just
uh investing in
additional agricultural
operations and I'm all for
that. What
really keeps jobs in New
Mexico
is uh
value-added,
value-added. We ship
a box carload
uh a month,
I think of pecans to
China. This was
1520 years
ago. I'm sure we ship more
than that now. Uh I
wish we shipped
uh
pecan candy
that keeps the, that keeps
the jobs in New Mexico. It
keeps the, the
production process in New
Mexico. Uh We
ship our
grain
silage to
Texas. We ship
our cattle to Texas. We feed them
in Texas, we send
them to Kansas
and they're processed in Kansas
and then we buy the beef
back. But we,
we have lost a whole multitude
of, of jobs
there. Dairies on
the east side of the state
are moving out quickly.
They're, they're moving across the
state line where there's
less regulation on the water,
which I'm very much in favor
of regulation on water. Don't get
me wrong. Uh but
just easy for them
and there's less uh
regulation of the industry
and as a whole.
So
I would just
suggest that
when we look at, at the
investments, a really
low hanging fruit and a good
place to invest. Is
it in value-added
agriculture? Right.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you, representative Chatfield
now, Representative Serato,
>> thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank you Marquita.
As always for bringing your presentations
forward. Always appreciate hearing from
you. Um The big theme
of all my questions kind of gets back
to this idea of getting money out the
door, which it's good to see a
lot of those funds starting to get
funded and seeing that move. I know
it, it took a little longer than I was
than I think I was anticipating,
but I'm just always eager
bear. So maybe that's part of it. Um
So getting it up or a couple
of questions. So when did
Makita come on board
with um an
M
fa
>> um madam
Mr Chairman? I think
within the last nine
months. >> Thank
you. And I had
a couple uh I was just curious about
that generally, I was also
curious, Mr Chair and um
and uh
PTA
um I noticed in, I
think it was page nine, right?
You or slide nine, you
pointed out
that 35%
that the IMF A's
investment into New Mexico
based funds makes up
35% of the total,
whereas our national makes about
2%. So it sounds
like there is a larger impact
on New Mexico Based firms
which you are funds which you were pointing
out. Really do focus on New Mexico.
Have you or
the funds themselves seen
additional interest from
additional capital because
of the investment that NM is
providing? >> So
um Mr Chairman
representative, I'm not sure
that we're early enough. I mean, we're,
we're far enough into this.
One of the reasons that we
are looking and you can see they're very
small investments in some instances,
$2 million.04 million
dollars. Um and one
of our reasons is to just get
their attention so that some of
their, their attention is paid
to New Mexico. So we're
only investing in these national
funds when there's high alignment
of mission or
uh sector. Um
and just getting their attention,
having enough, having
someone, one of their fund
participants call
regularly and say, what are you doing
in New Mexico that keeps
it alive and they, they put more time
here. So that was the
goal we haven't yet seen.
Um We haven't had enough time
for us to
find out whether or not that's
been really successful yet,
>> Mr chair Panelist with, with,
in terms of the ones for New Mexico,
those seems like those seem like to have
larger percentage impacts.
Are you seeing more capital
being uh looked
at in these New Mexico funds because of
what investing there?
Or I know it's hard to make
a correlation there. But if there's any
sort of correlation that you were some
of the funds have seen or is that just still too
early? Also for >> those, Mr
Chairman Representative, I think
it's still pretty early. The first one that
we funded
was for Tramway and
that had a large investment from the State
Investment Council as well.
So their targeted
investment size
was about
$40 million. We
put in seven, I think the
S IC put in somewhere
like that or just a little bit more.
So a significant portion
came from the State.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you, Panelist. And
my hope is that we do see
more capital coming in because of what we're
doing. I know that's, that's where we
align. I know that how the
legislation was created was
that um you could either go
into funds or you could
go, you know, directly
fund businesses. I know
in some of our early conversations where you
felt more comfortable with going to fund,
it seems like on slide
11, you are pointing
to specific o opening
up that possibility of investing in specific
businesses. Is that right,
>> Mr Chairman, this is
actually these are funds that we're currently
looking at. These are pipelines of funds.
So these are, these are just
institutional funds. So we have not
yet looked at um
direct investments primarily
because we needed to get,
we needed to get better at this
as an just as an agency
and make sure that we had all the right
pieces in place that our investment
policies were working well.
Um I don't know, you know how
eager we are to get into that since
there are so many additional
funds that we can
attract with these dollars.
Um But I do expect that we
might do some coves if
there's follow on capital from some of
these national firms that that's where you would
see that direct investment
is in some follow on.
We have the opportunity through
our participation in the fund
and our side letter agreement to
actually do coves.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you, Panelist.
You know, part of I think my interest
in some of the is it feels like it
is going back to that original
idea, right? How are we just moving this
money as quickly as possible
to encourage that movement or
encourage that growth? We want to see
the last thing I'll, I'll ask Mr
Chairman and this will be
that, you know, you lay down on
page
four,
what your objectives are
and what your, what are the measurements you're
looking at, you know,
from your,
do you all have
goals? I know oftentime you're very
like, are these weighted
in any way in your mind? Um
You know, what is the measure of success?
I guess I, I know more
money per business
is great, right? Um However,
you know, I, I guess what are there,
are there um milestones
you want to hit before you do
additional investing or until
you feel really secure in what you're
doing? >> Um Mr Chairman?
That's an excellent question because that's
exactly where we are right now. As
we go to invest that last
quarter of the dollars
that are available, we are
looking at what we've put out to
date. We chose very
specifically as an investment
committee not to have
top-down
goals. Um
because you have to
wait some time for the
investment to come along. So
we did sort of organically
grow this from the bottom
up, picking out um
funds that were currently
uh raising money and
had that high alignment
of industry sector
experience in particular.
So now we're
75% there. We've got
a mix of both uh national
and state dollars and
now we are looking to see where that
last quarter should be directed
to. So we are, we,
we purposefully took a pause
probably just a month pause, but
still a pause for
us to take a look and see
what are we expecting,
you know, what are the dollars
looking like? What is that,
what, what are the returns looking like?
Some of these are gonna be much
longer in that J
curve and some of them are gonna be
much shorter. So we need to take a
look at that and
that's what the investment committee is
currently doing. So
excellent timing on that question.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you, Panelas. You know,
I I do, I appreciate this
conversation. I'm glad to see some
of the money start moving, to be honest with
you. Um And I think I'm always
kind of an eager beaver when it comes to, to
investments and seeing some growth
movement and being
less how to say,
I don't want to say risky but
less risk averse. Um, you
know, we, I just came from HOC yesterday
and that they consistently
said over and over again that they, that our
invest, this is a very different kind of fund
and it's a very different thing, however, that
those funds, they've been so
conservative that we've not seen
the growth, you know, that other places
had for a lot of reasons.
Um And we talked about that other day,
but, you know, I'm just hoping with
some of these funds that we do kind
of take this moment as
you all learn and really uh
take some risks that
might really pay off for New Mexico. So
thank you for, for, for >> your
>> help. >> And Mr Chairman in that
regard, I think the places where you'll see
that kind of um
lean in um
to the business
cycle would be in those funds
that we're creating the advanced New
Mexico and the opportunity we spent
a lot of time trying to grow
those particular
funds. Um One
is, you know, we're closed and they've
got a staffer on
site, the other one
failed to close because they couldn't raise
the additional capital.
So um or, or
the process of doing it, but
we'll, we'll look at that again at the
point at which they've got capital
in the meantime, that additional $10
million we need to get it back into that
same strategy.
So
$20 million of
the, of the state's 50
is invested
specifically in those flexible
debt and equity,
you know, event driven
transactions, very flexible,
nontraditional businesses.
Um And that's where you'll see the real
benefit that takes a long time
to grow because we had to find the
investor grow the
strategy. Um And
so it, it just didn't come to
us in a pretty package. We really
had to work hard at growing that.
And we're still, you know, we're working now
to figure out how to redirect that 10
million into a similar
kind of model for investment.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Thank you representative. Thank you
Marquita Representative
Lujan. Thank
you. And,
>> and do you have
to? All
right, olives
you.
No.
Thank you so much Mr Chair.
Um That's a good segue
too. I was looking at some of the same
notes. I think that our representative Serato
was talking about on page
nine and looking at that
available $16.4
million. Uh
That would
be
the additional money that we're looking
to be innovative with. Is that correct,
Mr Chair,
>> Mr Chair? About 10 million.
We're still looking to be
very innovative with that
will last
um 16
million or so is
what we're currently pausing
on to reflect where we think
we have holes in our portfolio
both in terms of mix
and stage companies.
>> Great. So as we're talking about
the portfolio, where are we with our,
our with the energy
sector uh
in the portfolio, Mr
Chair, >> Mr Chair
Dangerous Ventures. That's one of the
sectors that they're focused on
energy and
climate.
>> And so is that where we're going to,
is that where we're taking a bigger
pause to look at the innovation
and, and how we're growing?
There is my question
as well, Mr Chair, >> Mr
Chairman Representative, we're
looking to sort of the overall
strategy. Again, we didn't
build our portfolio
with goals and,
and going down, we, it was built
up, it was a very organic process.
And so we're looking to see exactly
where we are where we think we
as an investment committee
would like to see additional
investment and then try to
find the vehicles that fit that
strategy. So we're
pausing as we just take an
overall look at the
portfolio.
>> Uh Mr chair uh Mark, can
you thank you and just thank you for again, I'm
always thank you for all your work and, and
your expertise and everything. But
when we live in the state, uh
you know, we're
unparalleled with our
um
expertise in assets
in
energy
there, maybe it's clear now, maybe
it's just me, I don't know what's going on.
Um
So,
and where we are moving and when we're
having this conversation with our infrastructure
and our water issues for our
state in economic
development, which is our mission
for having NM
fa um
I would like to just
be I know and I
know you will brief us, but I think
a little more detail and
specifically with the energy
sector and how that is
going to be
um
implemented if you will, where
you're focused on there.
Because right now that this
is, this is where the innovation
is, this is where the
diversification of
our economy is. These are
where the challenges
we are facing right now under
climate change. I
appreciate the, you know
what we've done so far, but
there's so much more we need to
do when we're looking at
huge um
opportunities even here in
Albuquerque. Um I
just went two weeks ago
to advance
Energy
uh alliance
uh
group that they're
looking to be
innovative out
in
at the airport here in Albuquerque to
create a huge
opportunity with renewable
energy there. Where
we, where are we moving there? I would,
I would like to be
a little bit more um
involved all of us and
have that information because
that's really where we are
as far as our water. We're going
to be having a huge opportunity. We're gonna be
talking about produce water, brackish
water. We're gonna have those, those
issues at hand. These
are the challenges, these are the
economic development challenges
and we're removing an infrastructure and
water. So I would just
be uh a
voice to say
this is really where we need to be
channeling and really,
really diverting our
attention to this sector.
Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative.
Uh All right. Any
other comments,
questions, thoughts,
feelings, emotions,
anything else out there? OK.
Looks good. Thank you very much.
Uh Marquita. I know that we're gonna
see you again.
Um It's
looking like right after lunch.
Sure, not right after maybe.
Yeah, right after. Um,
thank you all very much. We do
have lunch over here uh
by the big CNM
sign over here to my
right and I
think that's it. We will
stand in recess
until
let's see here. We'll start right
up at 1:10 p.m.
Thank you. 110. Thanks.
