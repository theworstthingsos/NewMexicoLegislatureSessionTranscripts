members who have sacrificed to
preserve and protect those
freedoms and the country from
all enemies foreign and domestic
and whereas there exists in New
Mexico a long and proud history
of military service by its
residents dating back to the
indigenous peoples who are
willing to fight for and defend
their land from European
settlers and whereas New
Mexicans turned back the
confederacy at the battle of
Glorieta pass in northern New
Mexico in eighteen sixty two and
we're as New Mexicans were an
integral part of teddy

all of that is good and
necessary but at the same time I
have to agree with
Representative on that one bills

they get due consideration Mr
speaker as an example there will
be a bill to help fund.

Thank you for bringing this

to me because my father's a
Vietnam veteran.
And I credit him for me being
here today besides the fact that
I'm his son.
His leadership and what he
taught me and the values that he
instilled in me as as as a young
man are reflected in how I treat
people today and how I work with
my colleagues I also would like
to say Mr speaker Dahlman that
as the oldest of three brothers
by at work.
On a weekly basis of my father
where where he's for yes to deal
with issues with the VA for yes

Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman please sealed all of.
They will yield to the gentle
lady.
Thank you and thank you very
much as always Representative
and all of your Sanchez for for
this memorial.
What can I say Mr speaker and
gentleman Representative
Martinez Alan of thing is
brought up.
Some really significant points
that I wanted though speak to.
Why there significant is because
I totally one hundred percent
agree.
That we must be honoring our
military and veterans every day.
Not just on the designated days
that we have.
Every time you see someone in
uniform period.
You thank them for their
service.
More so I would say those that
are defending the front lines
for a country as many of you
have heard over and over again.
It gives me good great sense of
pride that every time I mention
his name I am.
I have to remember that I am the
daughter.
Of the three war combat veteran.
He was in World War two eighty
second airborne Normandy drop.
He was.
Career more prisoner of war.
And he served two tours in
Vietnam.
As a special forces green beret.
He received the Purple Heart
twice.
And he has a number of other
metals.
And that is my father.
Fairly bit through he'll avoid
by from Los crucis doing on the
New Mexico.
Mr speaker and gentleman he
joined the army back in the
nineteen thirties in order to
help bring his family out of
poverty.
He lied about his age as many.
Young men did at that time so
that they could join.
To do two things one defend the
honor of their country and their
flag.
And of course to help their
families survive the aftermath
of the Great Depression.
So Mr speaker and gentleman as
the previous speakers of said I
would not be.
Why am if it were not for
families heal right but.
He's been honored in Washington
on any walls by the
congressional delegations in
Congress.
Thank god he appears on all
three wall walls of the veterans
memorial.
In Los crucis and I understand
in other memorials around the
state is a true hero he was my
hero he was a warrior.
The old warriors that you don't.
That we're losing today those
that are in their nineties in
the hundreds so Mister speaker
and gentleman it means a great
deal to me.
Being the daughter he only had
three daughters.
But he had.
Two grandsons and now he's in
heaven from heaven he has for.
Great grandsons.
All of whom honor him on a daily
basis in our prayers.
And in our economic trends as a
family when we speak so in the
name of all of those.
In military active duty and
veterans and those that have
given their lives.
To protect and honor this
constitution of the United
States in here in New Mexico.
Thank you so much Mr speaker and
gentleman and all the sponsors
we honor them today and every
day in our lives thank you so
much.
There's a divisional and
promoted Representative block.

and in that lawsuit it was the
veterans wives that showed up.
And
Mr speaker
reason for that is the most
because was that some of these
Vietnam vets.
That
Can down with the engine on
poisoning
We're suffering from PTSD and
still kind of a.
Detach from integrating into
society.
And
But that was a good example is
the most because the general
principle of how.
The wives of veterans have
stepped up to address the needs
of their spouses in this
particular case is Agent Orange
outreach program.
Yes my speaker that program
right in bedrooms.
Fund House all the way down to
support.
And
It had a very.
Positive impact on.
On those veterans being able to.
To make a claim to that Agent
Orange lawsuits against Dow
chemical as though speaker.
Speaker
Representative Alcon holds a lot
of truth.
in regards to how this chamber.
This of this chamber about the
legislature.
Has addressed some of the.
The concerns of our return
population.
And I give the example of some
of the speaker of a.
This legislation that I bought
for nineteen ninety eight.
It was a.
The property tax exemption from
the percent service related
disabled vets.
Mr speaker that it took five
years for us to pass that
legislation.
And that's seconded testifying
were.
veterans like flower Giada's
from my please go to my
community.
Labour's you.
When we came back to.
Application the sooner okay.
Resources director
Brought in for an interview
Senator didn't have a job for
them.
And as he was walking out I
looked around and inside is a.
It's application goes straight
into the trash can estimates
speaker.
And flagged gentleman that came
up to testify.
On behalf of the.
Representative percent disabled
vets because it was one of those
guys is the most because.
I love going naked metal
detector at an airport.
Estimates speaker Jim from
Cibola in that metal detector
would go off.
Because he had that much metal
in his body.
From an explosion of a Japanese
girl made a grenade that landed
on is that is the most because
We had other veterans provided
us this must be Belgium from
seeing the light that came to
these hearings.
Senator running is.
And so on why shop for polls
yeah maybe six bullet holes in
his arm and basically didn't
have any movement in this are.
But it looked like.
In need.
Is this the most because this is
the caliber so much because of a
single a of some these threats.
That came.
Testified on behalf of that
legislation.
And
especially at the more lies the
same speaker that the the tax
and Representative committee.
This piece of legislation for.
Five straight years but then
they would see the legislation
that would bring the tax credit.
tax benefits.
Oil and gas operations that
would easily pass.
The
committee.
And generated the veterans and
came down and.
for the fourth year they were.
We're kind of in a rebellious
mode.
And the final bill got tabled
again and never resurrected the.
They were all local in their
protest of that committee.
That legislation forward.
Speaker
I was fortunate to have a
father the I don't know what to
on the front lines in Germany
and France.
And it was because of him back
into the session with that is
the on.
To to do some reform for our
vets and that was my first
project.
Hundred percent service related
disabled property tax exemption.
And
You know as the most people
don't from some of them are past
the age forty eight years old.
I was eighteen years old just
three months after graduating
from high school.
But I saw one aspect of my
father that none of my other
seven civilians on.
Not even my mother.
And that was when I would come
home from a party in New.
Thank kind of drunk in my but as
the most because a during my
teen teenage years.
you know my when I was little I.
Opened in the kitchen.
in me coming in at two three
fund morning from flooding on
Monday and
And many of many occasions the
most because of unstable a.
Come in.
In order to my doctor and see my
dad calling on the floor.
He was basically.
Those battles.
It was actually experiencing
that right then and there.
And I just glancing my dad kind
of go through that and I'd wake
him up and
Take him back to his bed
estimates speaker.
And that's the with me forever.
You know what I kind of
something happened because of
that experience which was
running for legislation to this
body.
Based on the need to know that
our veterans
Bring for that is overwhelming
Mississippi for them to kind of
a
the.
Do to their lives.
And that's what we do when we
bring forth legislation is that.
It is it brings dignity to the
lives of our veterans.
And and and then at
it also kind of compliments.
Thank congratulates.
The effort and the pain and the
sorrow that they went through
especially in those who are.
Point areas of our country is
the most eager to thank you

In different capacities of
service
I get a little
For you know motion over
thinking about our veterans and
all that they have done for us
in and giving the the ultimate
sacrifice and putting everything
on the line for all of us so
that we could be here I just
want to note that there are
about two thousand US service
members that reenter into
civilian life every year and
they're learning to re orient
themselves into
into a different world for more
than what they have lived and
experienced in about five point
two million I have experience
behavior health issues.
And more than half of those
veterans.
Do not seek help.
The suffer in silence.
And I wanted to take note of
that and what what it is and
what our responsibility is here
and making sure that.
We identify that as much as
possible as possible that
behavioral health and identify
be behavioral health as an
essential.
Health conditions.
For all of us and we have this
role to make sure that our
service members or veterans and
their families are prepared for
their next steps as are entering
into and reorienting themselves
into civilian life and I just
want to
to say that I'm proud to to be
on the the house appropriations
and finance committee were we a
found money and and our budgets
for the behavioral health of our
veterans in our state and I want
to stand in full support of this

Some of the major branches of
the US armed forces.
My son and my son in law are the
youngest and biggest just
recently got discharged and.
There are a lot of veterans in
my district that are often
asking for assistance and I
believe that these assistance
that they're asking for is right
for them because they earned it
we are not asking for handouts
they are asking for a simple
assistance that's right for me
to them.
I am proud to say that.
In our inventions made of
American culture.
Our native Americans have the
highest percentage of a specific
group to volunteer for the armed
forces.
I used to have one of the four
remaining at home code talkers
until we lost them this past
summer.
And now we have only three of
Navajo code talkers.
One of the celebrated his one
hundred and sixth birthday

recognition that we are giving
our veterans because it is
something that is right for
them.

Have the burners date to you.
Here by the.
Really wasn't was on one percent
of New thank you Mr speaker good
afternoon good afternoon members
reminder that this Thursday the
twenty third is our deadline for
capital outlay to be turned into
the at the LCS also on your desk
you'll find a large spreadsheet
the in my hand writing uses
three million dollars plus and
so what this spreadsheet is is
it's the governor's list of all
of the requests she has received
to date we would without any
commitment so much is going to
fund but this is our list to
date and so in years past I know
the practice has been we we fill
our seats and then we find out
the day after maybe there after
some time that the governor's
funded X. amount of dollars for
project you gave a lot of money
to and then you find out well I
don't know how my money really
affected good change in
utilizing money effectively to
the projects and so this year
we're we're going to try
something different and in
regards to trying to bring
transparency and collaboration
into the process and so in
working with the governor's
office the share this list with
us and so if you want to
participate you don't you can if
you don't want to do you don't
have to but at this point time
if you look at the sheet that
has New Mexico legislature up on
top capital outlay governor
collaboration request form you
will notice that.
it's it's it's basically a
listing of if in fact you have a
project in your district and
maybe you and a couple other
members want to try to effect
change that is greater than
three million dollars that you
don't have the capacity to do so
you can get together put that
project number the web number
appropriation request the title
and what you may be willing to
fund and the attempt will be
then to have the governor see
how she may affect
adding additional dollars to
that large request and so this
is really an attempt by by the
governor and the legislature the
Senate is doing the same exact
thing on their side to try to
bring some clarity and to be
able to begin to plan these
things out better so that we can
more efficiently and prudently
use these dollars to affect
better change greater change
within our communities and so of
look at the date please note
that today at five PM is the
deadline to receive these
requests back to our office room
three sixteen if you want to
have bring a hard copy that's
fine if you want to scan and
email them to our assistance
that's fine as well again in the
attempt is that to compile these
reconcile them all and so the.
Governor staff made the the
mention that on Wednesday by
noon they would be able to
provide us a list that the
governor has
approved that lists her projects
as well as the dollar amount she
will be funding for this capital
outlay season and so.
It's a work in progress it's not
perfect but I think it's it's
it's a valuable attempt to try
to bring some clarity and again
some focus on to try to make
sure that we can stretch these
dollars as as much as we can so
any questions I'm here any
questions feel free to just call
me or the card actually on there

questions that I do have is
whether or not this has Mr cost

Thank you Mr speaker a.
This basically is an act
relating to road safety and what
we're asking is that it requires
at least two persons for the

A little globally that is used
in the movie the freight let's
think of that I will stand for
questions there is a bait the
gentleman from Travis
representative Nibert.
Thank you Mr speaker real and
gentleman from McKinley County
yield.
Chavis thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Mr speaker one issue that the we
raising Committee was.
With the advent of technology
and it seems like not just on
the highways but may be
applicables to rail as well is
the event of a Torrez driven
vehicles and I was wondering if
any thought of the given to the
issue of no
actual people being on board of
the locomotive them for it to be
Driven if you will through some
Mechanism at a central location
somewhere in the United States.
Okay Mister speaker I hope I can
understand this question what
you're asking as with all the
new stuff that's coming out in
this world
Eventually you're hoping that
there will be nobody on the
train.
Mr speaker it's not my hope it's
with the advent of technology it
seems that there are a lot of
technology companies that are.
Moving toward.
The.
Thomas.
Creative in vehicles with no one
on board whether be trucks cars
and I would assume the same
technology would apply to trains
and I was wondering if any of if
any thought have been given to
the possibility that.
That technology may catch up
with the railroads and would be
utilized in that contest in
which case of this will this.
Bill would be adverse to that
would not.
Mr leader gentleman over that
would have been we would have
legislation just like we have on
the economist said mice that
would allow us to be happened to
happen and no I'm not.
The other two million for the
village of Milan following the.
Two three miles of railroad cars
it would scare me that it would
have a if that dream would be
and the in the world is that my
nose right to pick up this is
land and moderate to pick up as
all that stuff to where to put
the cruise control on it and so
does that and speeds up and it
keeps you in the line but I have
to be behind the hotel for that
truck to be globally.
So would you compare something
like that.
To a trade.
That sense the long that's going
through our area I think we need
to have some separate
legislation in the future to
allow that to happen.
Mr speaker and gentleman I don't
disagree but it seems to me that
billions of dollars are being
invested by some very large
companies today to remove
drivers from your ranger pick up
from cars from semi trucks and
I'm just asking the question
with that same technology not
also find its way into
applications on railroads.
Mr speaker and gentleman
the in order to answer that
question all I can say is that
probably would but in today's
world we need to be careful what
we're we're we're going right
now.
Mr speaker and gentleman in
today's world there's two
members are to people on the
train is or not.
Mr speaker and gentleman
hopefully yes.
Well Mr speaker and gentleman
not hopefully yes I think it's
required isn't Mr speaker and
gentleman.
The gentleman yes.
Mr speaker and gentleman so why
is this law necessary if that is
the current state of affairs
today.
Gentleman from Chavis up.
The two member crew is not
mandatory.
And right now just think what
you're speaking about they're
talking about changing that
because of everything that's
coming up in the world.
And Mr speaker and gentleman the
the fact of the matter is
there's two members required
under collective bargaining
agreements and at the current
time those agreements are being
subject to negotiations and it
just seems odd that this piece
of legislation is coming up in
the Middle those negotiations
and and so Mister speaker and
gentleman.
If that is the case it seems to
me that the the.
Unions yeah look it out after
the safety of their members
would want to maintain that the
issue.
Within their own province of
power.
And we want to negotiate what is
best for their union membership
but this is statutorily going to
require that which takes it out
of their hands as well as the
roads and so I'm a bit the
baffled by by the legislation
other than maybe it's being
utilized for other purposes so
Mr speaker and gentleman for
that reason I rise to to
Not support the this type of
legislation that gets us and the
things that I think we should
not be getting into thank you Mr
speaker thank you gentlemen
there's further debate the
gentleman from San Juan
Representative lane.
Thank you Mr speaker the
gentleman from Cibola county
yield
yield to the gentleman from San
Juan Mr speaker German principal
would you kindly explain to the
body of the the.
The reason for the need for this
bill.
Do you the one minute.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
San Juan right now the roads on
to go to a one person because
the positive train control
Boston drink until of course
cannot replace all duties of the
conductor.
Mr speaker John from Cibola
it sounds like what you're
describing is some kind of a
safety rationale.
Speaker gentleman I could
explain it better.
Mr speaker gentle from C. what
can you explain the body what
what is the safety concern.
The gentleman are you thinking
of you remember and committee
the biggest concern there was is
that there has the one person
alone on the trading has to
seven times have to control all
kinds of different things at the
same time and there is no way
that they can handle everything
that's there if in case of an
emergency even in case more than
anything else that one person
has to use the bathroom.
you know what's going to happen
and.
Mr speaker Jennifer Cibola and
so the the concern is if you
have a trained in New Mexico
that is a one person creating
that person as a medical
emergency or something goes goes
off the rails terrible pun
intended and it causes some kind
of a reaction you need more than
one person on on board is that
correct this gentleman again if
I could have said it better.
Mr speaker gentleman from Cibola
it seems then that as a body we
should be concerned about all
trains in New Mexico including
passenger trains with the same
concerns that fair.
Mr speaker gentleman yes.
Mr speaker general principle or
would you consider a an
amendment friendly if we amended
this to include all trains in
New Mexico including passenger
trains.
The gentleman I my understanding
is that we would consider is a
different set of rules for
different trains and it would be
hard to get to that area.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Cibola but if if the concern is
for the safety of the public to
make sure that we have two
persons on each train it seems
like we could actually
streamline a lot of confusion
and just pass a single law that
applies to all trains in New
Mexico whether they're free or
whether their passenger and make
sure that we have a two man crew
on all those trains.
The gentleman I have been told
that the the passenger trains
have up to five to members on
board.
Mr speaker gentle from C. well
then it seems like it would
follow that would be okay to
mandate in a lot of that lease
up to correct.
Hey I have five right now why
would we want to bring it down
to two Mr speaker and gentleman
from Cibola it's a good question
if they're already doing that
right now why would we codified
into law as I recalled.
Are we currently having a two
person crew on freight trains
right now.
Mr speaker again like I
explained earlier but we have
the two member crews however it
is not mandatory.
Mr speaker gentleman from see
what when you say it's not
mandatory you mean it's not
codified in statute.
That is correct Mr speaker
gentle from C. more than it
would follow I think that it's
not codified in statute for
passenger trains either correct.
Right.
Mr speaker German principle that
it seems like to me as a body of
for going to tackle this issue
we need to get our arms around
the safety piece of that's the
underlying rationale and so it
seems that as a body we should
consider amending this bill to
include all trains whether
freight or passenger.
I think the best way to do this
is together and put together
another bill that'll figure that
part Mr speaker German well I
I'm afraid that the time for
dropping new bills is has passed
on fortune otherwise maybe we
can consider co sponsored such a
bill but we do have up to the
minute here on the floor and so
again if the if the desire is to
make sure that all trains are
operated safely in the case of
an Representative medical
emergency or anything else it
seems like a very good codified
for all trains in New Mexico is
that correct.
The speaker then within the.
Conflict of federal law.
Mr speaker and gentleman from C.
will can you explain that
rationale.
Mr leader gentleman what happens
is okay.
Other passenger train this is
the rules are hold the budget
different than five months what
we do on for eight you gotta
remember also that tone were
hauling freight we also a all
hazardous materials.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
single I I understand that but
if of train goes off the the
tracks whether it's one car
passenger trainer a thousand car
freight train it's still going
to cause disruption and and
possible harm to citizens and so
I think that's what we should be
focusing on.
Mr speaker gentle from C. what
can you share with the body how
many accidents have there been
in New Mexico involving freight
trains were there was only a one
person creating that because
that accident.
This is the man zero because at
this time we don't have one
person crews.
Mr speaker gentleman from.
Cibola so at this point we've
never had an accident in our
state's history.
We're currently running to.
Crew on every train in New
Mexico.
We just didn't amendment to
strip out the civil penalties.
So there's no teeth in the bill
anymore so Mister speaker
gentleman from C. one kind of
scratch my head and wonder what
what's the purpose of the bill
really what are we trying to get
out here by passing this
legislation the gentleman up
there is peace in the bill
because the department of
transportation the secretary of
transportation
allows for civil penalties to be
assist against the real roads so
we additional needed and in our
village is already taking care
of on the federal level.
Mr speaker gentleman from Cibola
so.
I think.
What I have a concern within a
bill like this.
Is what we're already doing the
very thing that we're saying we
need to put in statute.
What we're not saying though is
that there is an ongoing dispute
between the train themselves and
the underlying labor you.
And the labor union says it's
unsafe to go below to.
The train say no it is safe to
go below to.
And they're asking us to decide
which of those is correct.
Mr speaker gentle from Cibola
typically would look at well
what what's happened in the
past.
But in this case we don't have
an example of where Nexans been
caused by less than two.
And that leads me to think well.
Why should we jump in the middle
of this it's already happening
there's only two man crew.
Why did we do codified in
statute I think Mister speaker
it's a bad policy to jump into
contract negotiations and
codified in law.
And I understand that parties
one of flex whether it's you or
or the train owner want to flex
their political might.
but Mr speaker and gentleman
that's what I see is truly
happening here because if not
they would be in there be an
appetite to amend this to make
sure that all Transamerica
including passengers which by
the way.
You're hauling human beings.
Which to me seems a little more
important than than hauling
cattle or whatever else these
freight trains hauling and we're
saying no we're not going to
call to find a statute that you
have to have
to pass and to creating only
for.
This particular set a train
which happens to have you
membership on the floor right
now and I think that's pretty
telling as well so Mister
speaker gentleman from Cibola I
don't think this is really about
safety I think this about
contract negotiations and I
think it's bad policy for us to
dive into that from the
legislative perspective thank
you Mr speaker for the debate on
affirmative Representative
black.
Thank you Mr speaker with kind
gentleman yield please the
speaker I yield to the gentleman
from a.
Otero Tenaglia thank you Mr
speaker.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman so I'm and your bill
I'm reading it here and it says
class one and class two
railroads could you please tell
me Mr speaker how many class one
railroads we have in the state.
Gentleman from what that'll we
have to.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentleman how many class to Rio
roads do we have in the state Mr
speaker.
At this time and gentleman from
a total zero.
Thank you Mr speaker I
appreciate that answer so I'm
just looking at the news and
recent derailments and trains
can you tell me how many of
these recent derailments across
the nation have been due to.
Creating and not a Quitman
failure Mr speaker.
the speaker a gentleman
we really can say that the crew
members have failed to do their
job all of these accidents that
have happened I because this is
the failure of equipment.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
John and that's exactly the
answer that I was expecting
because I think that this bill
has a lot to do with creating
but not necessarily the
equipment to Mr speaker so I
will keep on going here and I
see that.
This bill requires two crew
members per locomotive can you
define what crewmember is Mister
speaker.
It's on the line from with that
it is in the bill.
To to to to and we did amendment
on that in order to make sure it
was in there but I can't find it
it is one twenty one.
One engineer one of.
One and.
Or one conductor.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
John so there could be
technically to engineers or two
conductors is that correct Mr
speaker and gentleman Mr speaker
and gentleman electric.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen so isn't already
current policy to have to
members on the locomotive Mr
speaker and gentleman.
This gentleman like I said
earlier.
We have to members but it is not
mandatory.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen so I guess my question
then would be what is the
impetus for this bill if this is
already current law is it due to
federal rulemaking that could
make it a little less strict is
that the reason Mr speaker.
Figure gentleman.
The.
It's not mandatory it is not
federal law.
So therefore this will allow us
to make sure that when that
three hundred car straight is go
with the New Mexico the we have
few people aboard that trade.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen so do you have any
statistics or data showing in
other countries where we don't
have this kind of requirement
already where one member has
created a catastrophe Mr speaker
gentleman.
I'm as a German or you have that
problem for the one crew member
alone on the train just had a
heart attack or something like
that or gotten sick in that
situation in that situation
eventually after many miles is
that the trading Census the
problem there was a problem and
it will slow down but.
It takes a lot of miles before
the trade decides that there is
a problem there.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen so.
Isn't it true that all freight
trains in the state of New
Mexico are on positive train
control meaning that the
engineer or I guess the
crewmember must respond to a
computer screen prompt or the
computer screen will stop the
train Mr speaker.
Speaker from the Linda Abbas of
there is no.
positive train control thank you
Mr speaker thank you gentleman
can you please repeat the
beginning that the answer
please.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
with that from the lintel and
Bosso there is no B. C. D..
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentleman do you.
Do you know why there's not Mr
speaker sentiment.
Speaker June from a dental
because the infrastructure has
not been set up for a.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentleman how many crashes or
significant events have
happened.
Due to the lack of such a
element in that train ride from
the lan to a Paso Mr speaker
gentleman.
just three or four about.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
German you you do not know the
answer.
The gentleman the answer was
about three or four.
Thank you Mr speaker or madam
speaker I apologize madam
speaker the gentleman okay so is
that true that the railroads if
they wanted to change this
policy they can do that via
collective bargaining through
the union with arbitration Mr
speaker Tallman.
Madam speaker John.
This
Madam speaker also they always
gentleman from with that
As the proponents of the
railroad gave it to us best when
they testified in our committee
and Judiciary the negotiating
this for forty years.
And they haven't done anything.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
thank you madam speaker
gentlemen I apologize I keep on
missing that one out of the
madam speaker gentleman's so I'm
reading the history here with
the with the trains with the
federal railroad administration
and it looks like since the
sixties they had about five
folks on the locomotive and then
from the nineties going down to
to so would be correct to say
it's been about thirty years
instead of forty Mr speaker
madam speaker gentleman's.
I think gentleman all I'm
telling you is what I heard the
proponent of the real roads say
in Judiciary.
Thank you madam speaker
gentleman all right you know I
appreciate the answers today at
there is a lot more questions
for me that answers that I
appreciate it madam speaker
gentleman thank you.
There is the debate the
gentleman from patron grant and
Hidalgo Representative us us.
Thank you madam speaker with the
kind gentleman.
You.
The.
Madam speaker a gentleman from
Silvercity.
Are you do you think you'll need
Mr speaker madam speaker the so
I I just wanted to make sure I
understood this right my
understanding is that you have a
there's a standing you contract
that mandates to people on a
train that is currently active.
This gentleman just like we
expect that in committee that is
not correct.
Mr speaker move or Jana me to he
will Mr speaker and gentleman
okay that's.
The information I'm getting Mr
speaker gentleman is that there
there you have a standing
contract since the nineties and
that currently have two people
on that train Mr speaker
gentlemen I I don't want to
repeat all the things that were
already said because it's a lot
of what we were going to talk
about for I was gonna ask about
but I think it's dangerous for
us to get in the middle of a
union negotiations between
anyone and and the you I believe
that's Mr speaker and gentleman
that's the the privilege that
the union has been negotiating
those type contracts I think it
would this would be setting a
bad precedence for many other
you contract negotiations would
you agree with that Mr speaker.
The speaker of course.
Well I knew you're gonna see
that Mr speaker.
But anyway Mr speaker I I know
that there's a standing contract
and that's really why can't
support this I know that this is
been going on for forty years
there's there's at least been to
people on the train this entire
time they can not remove those
two people even though it's not
of federal law but
they currently do have to people
and they can't remove it it's
still on active contract Montoya
is renegotiated between the two
of the two parties thank you Mr
speaker.
There's.
The lady from Bernalillo
Representative but.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman from Cibola in
McKinley yield Mister speaker I
yield to by the name of the lady
from Bernalillo.
Thank you Representative Mr
speaker
I'm not going to repeat what I
had to say about the collective
bargaining I do have concerns
regarding that
but I do also want to mention
that in Albuquerque there is the
council of governments and there
is a transportation board which
I sat on as vice president and I
do know that we didn't give of
funding to our trains including
our rail runner and if this does
pass I would urge
the gentleman from Cibola
McKinley Representative L. con
and the individuals with him to
meet with that board because
it's very important that if if
this passes then
those FTEs that you're looking
to would probably be funded
through some of that funding
thank you Mr speaker and and I
also repeat some of the concerns
that were brought up regarding a
collective bargaining thank you.
There is for debate the gentle
lady from Bernalillo
Representative Hochman Vigil but
if.
Thank you very much Mr speaker
does the gentleman from Steve
Cibola County you'll.
The lady from the on the screen.
Thank you Mr speaker I am I am
one of the a talking to from the
skies so I imagine that might be
kind of weird but I just have
one question for you is there a
as an action currently happening
the federal federal railroad
administration as dealing with
this exact topic.
The lady from the money all
right now it's a study.
Okay thank you Mr speaker and
and gentleman from from Cibola
county and what is that what is
that study of exactly.
The basically the the living
room but on the other to the.
Do we need to keep the people of
the trade.
Okay Mr speaker and gentleman
from stable
Was there another Committee
another another.
Summary from the federal
railroad administration that was
was drawn concerning two man
crew staffing and if so what was
that what what was that.
About and why was it withdrawn.
The.
The living room of the of the
speaker look basically is a with
be the FRA administrator chains
the study went away.
Okay Mister speaker and
gentleman from single accounting
but what part of the withdrawal
because but V. FRA came to an
affirmative decision that no
regulation on to increase
staffing is necessary for safe
railroad operations at this
time.
The the lady money to the
witnesses are saying you're
correct.
Okay that's all the questions I
have Mister speaker thank you a
gentleman from Cibola there's a
gentleman from Lee
Representative Scott.
Gentleman from simple in
McKinley hill please
the I yield to the gentleman
that someone over there.
No interest subject.
Of the automation of our
transportation systems
consideration we're
experimenting with driverless
trucks and drones to deliver
packages remotely with the
location on intervention so the
question is what both of finance
individuals current members.
Required to be physically
located.
Trump.
Yes.
Mr speaker.
We manage our political system
we manage systems remotely
possible that one of these
individuals serving of the
central control facilities look
at television screen would be
able to adequately monitor other
gentle actually only tried.
Mr speaker I don't think that
could happen we could have three
member crew and then have a
third member on the screen but
the we need the two member crew
on the train.
Mr speaker and gentleman we seem
to be moving away from that
direction if you will we will
defy.
For true individuals on
wondering because automation is
getting to be more robust so
every day.
It would seem to me.
The conductor or engineers
sitting in a central control
facility monitoring that tried
to play with the kids that much
slept in his own bed
were and was going to work the
following morning might actually
be.
Productive employees.
That was actually out on the
rails.
Don't seem to be reasonable.
The moment I am having trouble
following well I I I can see the
reason that you're giving me
right now if.
Okay
I'll move on what about.
Hello to any of these trends
transit Mexico.
To our state.
All of the.
Requirement for the number of
personnel changes Alps of New
Mexico and interstate trying how
would that.
Handled if you will.
And transaction to New Mexico.
The the
Colorado and Arizona already
have these loss that we don't
have to that we do he we haven't
had any problem making sure that
there's two people on a trade in
that are leaving from New Mexico
into Arizona Florida Colorado.
Mr speaker as.
Issues continue.
The two person crew is not
correct I.
Other states can foresee
potential for.
There's no problems when the
train comes into the state from
the state that doesn't have a
term career day.
Mr speaker I don't see that
problem because the they'll have
somebody on that trade before it
enters New Mexico.
Circumstance our schools will
have to agree to disagree I'm
interested in opposition to
this.
Because I believe it is in
serving state government should
issues between.
The ownership of this.
Trying to appropriations and our
labor force.
In the interest of safety.
Both of the phones.
In terms of your room have
interest in maintaining a high
level of safety.
Consequences of research thank
you Mr speaker.
Thank you one of those
individuals current about go
with a little bit Roosevelt
and son we get it Representative
Zamora.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman yield Mister speaker I
yield to the gentleman from what
and or a one of those counties.
Mr speaker and gentleman I think
on the make you faint they'll be
looking for you under the chair
here in a minute.
I'm going to support your bill
and I want to make some comments
as to why.
In Clovis.
We're we're a hub and and the
train stopped there and and a
lot of the people.
My constituents work for the
railroad.
In Clovis.
Mr speaker and gentleman we have
made great sacrifices to the
railroad.
We have lost crossings.
For grain elevator that decided
they were going to ship in corn
on the rail to support our ag
community there.
And then losing that crossing Mr
speaker and gentleman.
There are people that live on
the south side of the railroad
tracks.
That if need an ambulance or.
A fire truck.
The emergency service people
have to go miles around that
because we lost that crossing.
We fought hard not to lose that
crossing but it didn't happen.
So we're forced to make those
sacrifices for the railroad.
Nobody in this debate has talked
about the well being of that one
person in that.
On that train manning that
train.
How.
Do the people look at this
point.
If that person was to get sick
or get hurt in some fashion and
and and Matt Mr speaker and
gentleman I've never been on a
train.
So I don't really know the ins
and outs and everything but if
you have one person out there in
the middle of the pastor between
von in fort Sumner.
And they're stopped there for
hours whether it be a blizzard.
Whether it's a a rail car that
needs to be detached and and put
on the siding because it can
proceed forward anymore.
I believe we ought to be looking
at the well being of the people
that are manning the training.
And why.
Mr speaker and gentleman why
can't the.
Railroad.
Sacrificing created job for our
communities.
And keep safety in that train
safety in mind for that person
in the train if he needs some
help.
If we take it.
The other places and other
businesses Mr speaker gentleman.
McDonnell's can go in and put
all robots.
Walmart isn't manning.
Check out.
Check out anymore.
So.
I believe.
In the humanity part of it in
creating jobs.
And the sacrifices that we make
for the railroad why can't the
railroad support a few jobs in
our communities for the
sacrifices that we make.
And Mr speaker and gentleman.
How do you look.
The well being of the one person
in the train.
Not just the safety of the train
but the well being of that one
person.
Being out in the middle of
nowhere and something happens to
them is the computer going to
help them.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
Gentleman I think
A lobbyist for the railroad said
it best.
We don't need this bill if we
take out the safety factor out
of the.
And that's exactly what we're
looking at the safety of the
people that are bad news that
trade.
And Mr speaker and gentleman I
look forward to support this
bill.
You won't find me in your corner
a lot of times I know that this
and this one is different this
is this is the well being of the
people on the train so the train
can be safe.
For other people in crossings
and everything else.
And this is about jobs.
And make sure that.
The the not only we work at
creating jobs but the people
that we make sacrifices for can
also create jobs for people in
our communities thank you Mr
speaker thank you John this for
the data from Bernalillo
Representative then a close.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman yield Mister speaker
at the event of an ideal.
Mr speaker and gentleman it's
coming fast upon us so we're
gonna have to make some critical
decisions around A. I.
artificial intelligence we talk
a lot about we don't really need
people in this and we don't
really need people in that role
in fact right now there is a are
can write papers for college
students that can write poems
and employees in an amazing
amount of things eventually we
will really need people for much
we may not even need us here
we're going to have to come to
that determination at some point
in the future.
We need human beings to have
employment.
Mr things otherwise we will be
determining that we all as a
species are obsolete.
Mr speaker I will support this
bill.
And I will support efforts in
the future that keeps keep human
beings working thank you Mr
speaker there's a gentleman from
Chavis and you know that
Representative Townsend.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman yield Mister speaker
now I really want to the
gentleman that's a way over
there for me to have this on
both sides.
Thank you gentlemen
a little bit about.
Our.
Is this requirement for the for
the people on the train.
Want to be on the field I mean
what is are they both going to
be it and the locomotive where
are these people and how will it
make it safer.
Because they're both on the
locomotive.
So.
Mr speaker just exactly.
How will this make the operation
of the train safer other than
having a redundant person on the
unlikely the engine had a heart
attack or something like that
what what does it really did.
This figure the most figures of
the rooms have is thank
complicated a day that is going
to be doing one thing the
conductor is going to be doing
another thing so this people who
need to be doing two different
things at the same time it's not
just one person that connected
to the ring strike to do the
conductor's job with the
conductor stated during the
engineer's job I decided
difficult to do.
I Mr speaker and gentleman I was
thinking about my friend's
comment about crossings and I
was wondering.
And I I I I understand exactly
what he's saying but I'm I was
trying to figure out how this
would.
That that would make the trains
go over.
Ross sings.
Quicker with is there some
regulation that says they can't
block crossings I mean is there
something how does that work.
This is the answer is
complicated there is a mixed
into the crossing conductor has
to get out of the trade then
assess the situation and help
out in whatever way they can.
Mr speaker I I
I have no problem supporting a
bill that will actually make an
operation.
A more safe.
Would reduce.
Infants as my friend.
Mentioned or.
If we had a history of issues I
would be I'd be all about it but
I mean even the day
We have.
One Representative that's voting
remotely.
And provoking counts just as
much as everybody else I mean
there are technologies now.
At allow.
All of this to occur.
I have a question for you and I
hope I'm not outline Mr speaker
but is one of your witnesses.
The attorney for the bargaining
unit that is currently
negotiating this.
This gentleman I have new
attorneys with the.
I'm sorry I didn't understand
you respect Mr speaker and
gentleman from Chavis I have no
attorney said in here with me.
Well when your well armed in our
chief of.
The closest thing that Mr
speaker that was for you to
stick cases of button down on
is is there.
By one of the people bargaining
Act part of the bargaining unit
that is being affected currently
by this.
The gentleman neither one of the
more.
Well.
That's the only part of this
mission Baker and gentleman that
that is troubling to me is it
gives every indication.
That there is an and and we're
being used as pawns in a
negotiation that the.
May be a good attorney would
have to have us to get it done.
Mr speaker I would I would it's
troubling.
because I see from the industry
that I came from.
The application of.
Technology has grown immensely.
And.
In the in the in the
transportation network that I
come from.
We use geosynchronous satellites
we had cameras we had Intel that
was you know plus or minus two
or three seconds we had what we
called.
Parity bits that ran in the
communication link to you know
I'm OK you're OK so that it made
sure that the operator of the
facility was.
Was
The knowledge you and was
participating in the decision
making it can be done and quite
frankly.
Mr speaker and gentleman
sometimes the application of
this technology.
Has more.
Safety and that then that of a
person who is involved in the
incident and under the stress of
making those decisions so I I
would
I would I would tell you that I
don't think personally from
reading a listing that this is a
much about safety as it is
bargaining and that troubles me
so Mr speaker and gentleman I
appreciate the the time thank
you share this with the
dimensional infer Lincoln an
update Representative Vincent.
Thank you Mr speaker the
gentleman yield.
Thank you gentleman in rubber a
Mr speaker.
So I've met both the you're the
expert witnesses and I do rise
and support.
Of your bill.
However both of them no.
How I feel about bargaining
units and you and this has
nothing I know it has everything
to do with bargaining.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
But it also has to do a safety.
And like in my.
Colleague from curry county.
Stated while ago this this is
about a minimal staffing of the
train.
And one question that I had Mr
speaker.
And gentlemen is what is the
role of the engineer.
The gentleman from the Lincoln
on to operate this thing.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman what is the role of
the conductor.
It's it's quite of hi the title
of the Netherlands had said in
the cars States charges the
placement of the of the cars
making sure the hazmat is
correctly done I'm it's on and
on on.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman and what what the
reason I ask you those questions
is because I know several people
that are engineers I know
several people that are
conductors.
And I know what those conductors
they end up walking miles making
sure they're checking trains.
And they're they're double
checking each other and they
have radios and they're in
constant communication because a
train is very complex.
And if you're not if you get
complacent at any time and
you're not checking each one of
those trains.
It's one of those cars and the
connections.
I can just sit here and tell you
how many people have lost their
lives doing that.
Not only have they lost their
lives Mr speaker and gentleman.
They lost limbs.
They're not going to get to work
anymore.
And I wish that we didn't have
to make a mandate I wish it
could just be handled through
the bargaining unit.
Mr speaker and gentleman DM do
you think that technology is
ever going to replace people.
The woman it's going to be tough
this is like I said I mean I can
for my amendment ready to pick
up to what I drove did manage to
go I mean it's awesome but
there's no way it always leads
that driver behind the wheel.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman I sure hope not
because I think we're in the
business of putting people to
work and not putting people out
of work.
Thank you Mr speaker there's
going to be generated from
violence at Representative made
about more you.
Thank you Mr speaker does the
gentleman yield Mister speaker I
yield to the gentle lady with
the other co from eight AM way
over here in the other corner
right Mr speaker I I I too am
rising in support of this bill I
come from bill and who is a big
Representative road town and I
have to say
this was the one issue that was
spoken to me in Walmart in
restaurants in I mean I had
dozens of people begging me to
support this this initiative is
so I have a couple of questions
how long does it take if you can
if you kind of have an idea
hello to take for free trying to
get from let's say Belinda
Winslow.
With that Mr speaker gentle lady
from the lens with it's a six
hour trip but normally it takes
about twelve.
I was gonna say I thought I
thought it was more of sorry Mr
speaker I thought it was more of
the latter anymore because what
is the Mister speaker of
Representative what is the
Average length of those trains
that are going to win so right
now.
The lady from the eight to
twelve sixty thousand feet or
two to three miles.
Mr speaker of the gentleman that
it that is amazing to me to know
the amount of weight and freight
that is going across and and and
right now it has to people in
control of it I have a the we
heard that several years ago a
couple of decades ago as we used
to have five members on the
train can you
Mr speaker and and gentleman
tell me about how long where
those trains at that point.
The lady from the eight to they
weren't even the by a long.
Mr speaker and gentleman thank
you I remember as a kid because
again going up around trains I
would count them I couldn't
imagine sitting there counting
these trains now when we're
sitting here waiting for them to
go by so it seems to me that
through negotiating agreements
we went from shorter trains with
more people to now longer trains
with less people and that is
crazy to me.
Not to mention I agree with my
colleague up here my main
concern is having that security
for that one person on the train
even though there may be
computers that they have to
touch it every every so many
minutes when when someone goes
into cardiac arrest arrest
equipment is what.
Determines whether they're going
to live or not.
And for those people that is why
I support this I have one last
question.
Do you have any idea kind of
generally what would happen to
let's say a railroad town like
balloon if it went down to one
person on the training and they
had all of these people employed
there Senator Hemphill what
would have to happen to the
staff of the of the of BNSF at
that point.
The lady from the amendment to I
was surprised to answer this but
you would lose about two hundred
people.
Mr speaker gentleman and that is
why I stand up here in support
of it because this would change
my community and I can't say
that I'm here representing them
if I were to vote against it
thank you Mr speaker so you know
for the debate the gentleman to
close thank you Mr speaker thank
you everybody for keeping and
expanding all the stardom Mr
speaker I now move that house

I am speaker would you give me
to that point.
The record reflect that
election is server placing house
bill one eighty one of her best
has been taken it is now subject
to debate amendment or
substitution the delimiter
explained the bill thank you Mr
speaker house bill one eighty
one is about extending the
national board certification
differential to not only
teachers but counselors and
administrators as well and with
that Mr speaker I'll stand for
questions there is a delay from
Chavis representative Nibert.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman from Bernalillo county
yield speaker I yield to the
gentleman.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Five one question I believe I
was under the impression that
we.
Provided a stipend to teachers
who receive such certification
to keep them in the classroom
because they were being
recognized as our excellence in
teaching is that is that an
accurate remember in some more
part Mr speaker and gentleman I
believe that that is part of the
intention what this bill is
seeking to do is send studies
have shown national board
certification to help our
students is to allow that
differential to go over to
administrators
to improve the outcomes as
administrators for
the teachers that they work with
and serve.
Mr speaker and gentleman it just
seems to me that we were
providing a stipend to try to
keep our best teachers in the
classroom and and allowing them
to.
Receive enhanced of monetary
compensation to keep them in the
classroom because I thought we
were seen.
Teachers go out of the classroom
and into administration so that
they would receive.
The higher pay scale and so for
allowing this type in the travel
with them into the
administration are we not.
Back to the same situation of
having teachers want to
naturally go into administration
when maybe there.
More effective in the classroom
with the children speaker
gentlemen I think one aspect
that you're neglecting it is the
importance of the on site
principal in providing for
professional development and
leading educators to develop
themselves as professionals as
well that we believe the
national board certification
would prepare those who have
been educators that attain
national board certification to
apply those same skills to our
our teachers as well so just
like we have a teacher shortage
we also have a shortage in
school administrators as well so
we think that this would provide
for that the other thing that
this would provide for he is
national board certification for
counselors school counselors as
we all know we're in dire need
of school counselors and really
well trained school counselors
at our school sites.
Mr speaker and gentleman I I
appreciate that and I do know
how important it is to have.
Very qualified principals and
others in the administration.
Overseeing the entire school if
you will I am just concerned
that we are private we're going
back to the former
recommendation and that is to
receive even more compensation
teachers with them want to
actually move into the
administration and there's not
that enhanced stipend if you
will for the teachers to stay
with the children
I'm I'm gonna support the
legislation I'm just
questioning whether or this puts
us back in the situation that I
thought we were trying to get
out of with that Mr speaker and
gentleman thank you for
answering my questions center

clothes and speaker I move that

The gentle lady from Los Alamos
Santa Fe and Santa Fe ready on
item number four yes Mr speaker
will you get me to that point
that the record reflect that
election is search for placing
howls ruled Development Bank
grants acquittal Affairs
committee substitute for house
bill one sixty has been taken it
is now subject to debate
amendment for substitution
provided to explain the bill.
You Mr speaker this bill Mr
speaker is designed to support
expanded broadband access
particularly in those areas that
are unserved or under served so
what we're talking about largely
although not exclusively is
giving the department of
transportation flexibility to
adjust their fees for areas such
as rural New Mexico where it is
not cost effective you might say
for providers to
pay commercial fees you to place
to have access to rights of way
so in this case it allows the
department of transportation to
waive fees when there's a
showing that will serve
under served and unserved areas
as defined in the connecting
Mexico act and with that Mr
speaker stand for questions
related from Caltrans said as
coalition representative
Armstrong.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
kindly the yield.
Mr speaker I kindly yield to the
gentle lady thank you Mr speaker
I know this was an issue and one
of my areas where the D. O. T.
was actually was an inflated
amount to be able to run some
broadband and so is this how is
this actually going to help
DOT to not do those fees X. so
extremely or just give them the
option to.
Mr speaker gentle lady it gives
it's a maze so it's permissive
up prior to this if this bill
when this bill passes shall I
say the department will have
more flexibility to do so they
have taken they believe they are
precluded precluded from by law
to now waive fees not
withstanding the fact that there
are these underserved areas so
we are trying to get this into
law to give them the tools that
they have they need to do just
exactly what you're hoping will
happen gentle lady thank you Mr
speaker thank you kind lady I
appreciate this legislation
thank you there's a gentleman
but thanks Gerry Harding quay
San Miguel and you
Representative Chatfield thank
you Mr speaker does the kind
lady yield Mister speaker I
yield to the gentleman.
Thank you gentle lady Mr speaker
one of the things that I have
met many times about is this
very issue in my district most
of you know that is one of the
bigger districts in the state of
New Mexico and probably the
nation it's very low population
and to bring broadband to these
low popular lonely.
Sparsely populated areas I guess
is what would be the word is can
be very expensive and we have
met with the department of
transportation we've met with
some of the various people
involved in getting the
broadband out there and the
costs to purchase right away for
one of those lines is is just
prohibitive and truly the
fastest easiest way to came
right away is down the highway
right away it's already thank
you right away that belongs to
the state this broadband is a
goal of stated goal of our state
of New Mexico it provides the
ability of rural people to enjoy
the same
access to the internet about
people in some of our larger
cities it's very important to us
and so Mister speaker I stand in
support of this bill thank you
there's further debate from
Travis Senator percent of
Townsend.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
would you deal.
Mr speaker gentleman I yield.
Of the lady with this bill
provide for.
Highway right of ways across
tribal properties.
Mr speaker gentleman no this is
exclusive to rights of way that
are controlled by the department
of transportation.
Gentlelady the highway right
away is
That crossed tribal lands did
they not have multiple uses are
they only single use.
Mr speaker and gentleman as I
understand that they have
multiple uses but the
department.
Can not extend it beyond what
they have Authority from the
tribe's the particulate tried to
cross over the their lands.
So Mr speaker gentle lady are
there any other lands in New
Mexico.
Of where we have highway right
of ways that.
Of.
This bill would not apply.
Mr speaker gentleman a one the
one that comes to mind is plans
administered by the except
commissioner for public lands.
So Mister speaker and gentle
lady is that something we should
do in order to enhance
broadband across New Mexico
could we add that authority to
kind of.
Promulgate a fast more
economical
Build out of broadband across
New Mexico.
Mr speaker gentleman that would
be the ideal however the
commissioner of public lands in
the constitutional provisions
relating to public lands record
has different requirements than
are imposed on the department of
transportation so it's a much
more
Nuanced and
complicated situation Mr speaker
and gentleman the commissioner
has expressed interest in
working on this issue but given
her constitutional duty to
acquire revenue in support of
the of the you know the early
childhood fund it cetera it's a
more difficult question than
simply doing what we're doing Mr
speaker gentle.
Thank you for that Mr speaker
gentle lady does the build out
of the broadband for public
benefit a Kerry with that the
right of eminent domain.
Mr speaker gentleman I'm
informed that the department
does not have authority to use
its public domain authority to
support broadband.
That was your question.
Mr speaker gentle lady
I think for the benefit of
public use.
Of.
Bill down on public.
With public funds it might have
the right of eminent domain but
that's just a question I
appreciate Mr speaker gentle
lady as for the main gentleman
from Lee Representative
Pettigrew.
Thank you Mr speaker the gentle
lady from Los Alamos field Mr
speaker I yield to the
gentleman.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I'm I
don't have any questions we
talked about the steering house
transportation I just want to
reiterate for some of my
concerns are with where we're at
on the broadband infrastructure
side.
We have Mr speaker and gentle
lady we have eleven rural co ops
telecommunication co ops that
have been with us for seat at
the table wanting to be
involved.
In the director of broadband.
Towards the end of last summer
and in committee in science and
technology committee
Made it clear that.
Mr speaker and gentle lady that.
They had given to projects to.
Co ops for rural New Mexico Mr
speaker and gentle lady neither
one of those two projects went
to a co op that have any clue
how to do telecommunications
never have.
Mr speaker and gentle lady on
top of that we want to give
rulemaking authority to the
state transportation commission
and right now it suggests that
maybe that's not the best place
to let somebody make rules so Mr
speaker and gentle lady for that
reason those reasons while I
agree with the bill but I don't
agree with the way that we're
implementing the money where the
money's going and who's gonna
make the decision on where that
money is going and who will be
reading the rules with respect
to how we do this so for that
reason I cannot support this
legislation thank you there's
the debate the gentle lady from
Bernalillo Representative
Hochman Vigil.
Thank you very much Mr speaker I
just want to take a moment to
commend on the sponsors of this
bill for those of us that have
been working on the wrong pin
issue for quite some time this
DOT right away issue was
identified first and foremost is
one of the most complex and
difficult issues of the state
was going to have to deal with
if we were to ever get the state
of New Mexico to a hundred
percent broadband coverage so I
commend Representative Chandler
for taking the issue head on and
for coming up with a solution
that will finally allow us to
get around this unnecessary beer
bureaucracy
so that we can continue to do
what the state needs to do which
is make sure that our kids get
educated
no matter where they are located
in the state and so just a
moment to say thank you
Representative Chandler Mr
speaker for and bringing this
bill I think it is an absolute
step in the right direction and
it needed to happen are quite
sometime ago so very happy it is
happening now thank you so much
is generated from Bernalillo
Representative but.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady from Santa Fe Los
Alamos re read the and Santa Fe
County yield.
gentlelady from Bernalillo I
gladly you thank you
Representative Mr speaker I do
believe that this is going in
the right direction
in terms of creating
access to broadband throughout
the state.
However having served on the
middle Rio Grande council of
governments as the vice
president of transportation
board
I do know that D. O. T.
is intertwined with
Mr cog which is how we we refer
to it transportation board in
the access to federal funds.
And the Mr **** actually was
created by the state of New
Mexico and so I it concerns me
that we are not incorporating
them into these processes
because it is a pretty lengthy
processes the that they go
through and I understand that
gentle lady
Mr cog in Albuquerque is
regional and I think that it's
important and I think that there
may be some other costs across
the state as well but it
concerns me that we're not
incorporating their sort of
reference into these bills and I
am going to support this but I
am bringing that up because I
think that it's important that
as we move forward into these
sorts of decisions
these especially when it comes
to transportation the this
particular especially in my area
this particular
agency is very important to our
decision making.
Thank you gentle lady from all
of those areas and Mister
speaker there's a gentleman from
San Juan Representative Allison.
Thank you Mr speaker well the
only.
Mr speaker I gladly yield to my
co sponsor on our constitutional
amendment a request the
gentleman from San Juan.
Thank you young lady Mr speaker
of.
In my district we have some of
the most rural of rural realists
and to get our internet to some
of the locations is going to
take a lot of work so also the
problems that we have is that
with the Navajo Nation we also
have a utility company that is
also of I have a sister company
called our wireless and they
take care of all the internet
installation how will your bill
help me and we have to deal with
what seems like a monopoly on my
nation.
you Mr speaker gentleman what
this will do is allow NMDOT to
waive fees for providers who
wish to provide service in your
area and as you know Mr speaker
and gentleman
The fee has been a barrier to
access from this for the smaller
providers because it has been
expensive and it doesn't pencil
out Mr speaker gentleman when
the fees were at you might argue
a market right so this I think
will add competition because
those smaller providers will be
able to request waivers
undoubtedly in your area which
I'm sure is under served and
allow you to get more
providers in your your in your
area Mr speaker John.
I hope that's true because of I
feel that the monopoly that the
nation is having with their own
carriers and stuff installers is
going to be a quite a problem
quite cumbersome thank you young
lady thank you Mr speaker si no
